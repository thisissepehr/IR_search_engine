Women & Infants Hosp., Dept. of Ped., Providence, RI This study assessed the impact of adolescent pregnancy on newi orn behavior in 2 cultural settings. The Brazelton Scale was administered during the first 3 days to 148 term newborns born in Florida (38 of mothers yrs.) and 155 born in Puerto Rico (42 of mothers <17 yrs). stepwise Mul tiplc Regression was used to analyze the-additive effects of maternal age and obstetric factors on 7 clusters of neonatal behavior. Puerto Rican infants of older, married mothers with higher gestation and Pondera! Index had higher habituation scores (p< .001). Higher scores for regulation of state were found for infants of older mothers, higher 9Pstation and less obstetric risk (p\u00b7\u00b7.009). Infants of older mothers with lower obstetric risk and drug score and higher Ponderal Index had higher scores on autonomic regulation (p< .02). In Florida, infants of older mothers with a lower druq 3core and higher Ponderal Index had higher motor scores (p<.03). Higher range of state scores were found in infants of older mothers with lower drug score and higher gestation (p<.001). Higher regulation of state scores were related to older mothers, lower drug score and higher apgar scores (p<.02). Infants older mothers with lower drug scores, lower obs7\".etric risk and Ponderal Index had higher autonomic regulation scores (p<.02). These data suggest that teenage pregnancy and obstetric factors have an additive adverse effect on newborn behavior. Furthermore, teenage pregnancy and other high risk factors affect the Brazelton clusters differently in the two cultures, suggesting an additional roJe of ethnicity on the effects on neonatal behavior. A double blind, placebo (P) controlled study of a 6 day course of steroid {S) therapy for IM was undertaken to ascertain (1) the clinical response to S and (2) the effect of S on the antibody response to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). College students with IM caused by EBV, who did not have tonsillar obstruction, were evaluated clinically and serologically IIgG and IgM anti-VCA, anti-EA(D/R), anti-EBNAJ at 0, 1,2,4,12, and 24 wks. Thus far, 14 pts have been followed at least 4 wks (mean 14 wks): 7 on P and 7 on S. There was no difference in the resolution of (a) clinical symptoms (dysphagia, fatigue, anorexia), (b) physical signs (fever, adenopathy, pharyngitis) or (c) days of school missed. On the Beck depression test, 0/14 pts were initially depressed, but 3/7 S were post steroid. 2/7 S pts had complications: a peritonsillar abscess and diabetes mellitus. IgG anti-VCA decreased in 3/5 Sand 5/6 P pts. 4/7 Sand 3/6 P pts had anti-EA (D). This persisted in 4/7 S pts at 4 wks, 2/4 at 12 wks and 1/5 at 24 wks. Only 1/7 P pts had anti-D titers at 4 wks and 0/7 thereafter. 3/7 S and 2/7 P pts have not yet developed anti-EBNA. Comparing the geometric mean titers ( Table) , the fall of IgG anti-VCA and .CT'ti-EA(D) may be slower in S pts. In these pts, S had no short term benefit. Macro-orchidism is a clinical predictor of the \"fragile-X\"syn-X-linked disorder of Dental retardation with an identifiable structural\"fragile\"site, fra (X)(q27),on the X-chromosome. Testicular volumes were determined at an adolescent clinic on a random sample of 348 normal healthy boys 12-18 yrs. of age Jf whom 221 were black & 127 were white. Measurements of the greatest width & length of each testicle with the subject standing were made by one of the investigators using a transparent straightedged ruler. Volumes were calculated with the formula for an elipsoid,-n-i,\u2022L\u2022w2. Race, wt., ht., age & sex maturity ratings (SMR) were recorded for each subject. Least squares analysis showed that combined volume of the testes (t.v.) is more correlated with pubic hair or genital maturity ratings than with race, age, ht. ,wt. ,or any combination thereof; p < .0001 for correlation with the SMR for pubic hair or for genitalia. There was no significant statistical difference in the mean volumes between the races at any SMR. Though the genital rating correlated slightly better than the pubic hair rating with the t.v.,the difference was not significant & mean SMR's were used for graphic purposes. Mean combined testicular volumes in cm3 with \u00b1one standard deviation were: SMR I. 10.05 \u00b1 6.44; SMR II. 13.49 :!: 6.79; SMR III. 29 \u00b1 11.17; SMR IV. 40.25 \u00b1 11.53; SMR V. 58.56 \u00b1 17.15 .",

Poor compliance with contraceptive regimens has been shown to be an important antecedent of adolescent pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to prospectively test the effect of a peer versus nurse counseling program on adolescent compliance with oral contraceptives. Fifty six females aged 14 to 19 from a lower socioeconomic background were predicted to be compliant or noncompliant based on a compliance index (Litt et al). The noncompliant subjects were then randomly assigned to a peer (n=25) or nurse (n=25) group. At the initial visit and at I, 2, and 4 month follow-up visits all subjects received Ortho-Novum 1/35 combined with a tablet marker and were counseled by a nurse or peer. Compliance was measured using a Guttman scale consisting of: I) avoidance of pregnancy 2) appointment adherence 3) pill count and 4) urinary fluorescence for riboflavin. At the first follow-up the adolescents counseled by a peer had a significantly (p<0.02) higher mean compliance level than the nurse group. At the remaining follow-up visits the peer group continued to have higher mean compliance levels although the differences were not statistically significant. Moreover, the subjects who were originally predicted to be compliant (n=6) and counseled by a nurse demonstrated lower (p<0.02) compliance and higher attrition (p<0.05) than the peer group. These results suggest that incorporating a peer counselor into the health care team may be an effective method of increasing adolescent compliance. Evaluating adolescent mother-infant interactive behaviors from 10 min. videotapes necessitated the development of a counting method with particular emphasis on adolescent behaviors not yet described in studies of older mothers. Based on previous methods developed for counting adult mother-infant behaviors, our method consisted of 37 individual maternal items and 5 infant items. The maternal items were included under the 5 traditional categories of gentle touch, caretaking behaviors, proximity to mother, visual behavior, vocal/verbal beiJ,,vior, and 2 additional categories: assertive touch and personal behavior, both thought to be unique to adolescents. Infant items were vocalization, general state, and activity, including eyes open or closed. Coders were trained, using a training videotape, to count the number of behaviors in 15-secnnd sequences for the entire 1 O minutes of the tape. Scores for each i tern were recorded on a score sheet and totaled. Coders practiced on 10 nonstudy tapes until they reached at least 80% agreement with an established coder. Pearson correlations confirmed interceder re 1iabi1 i ty. Neither the i ntercoder agreement scores no;\u00b7 the Pearson correlations fell below .86 for any item on the scoring of 130 additional videotapes. mrthr\u00b7d for measurinci adolescent mother-infant interactive behaviors is, therefore, reliable.",

Med., Rochester, N.Y.(Spon.-R. Hoekelman) Public concern involving adolescent teen pregnancies is mounting while other social problems remain unchecked. These adolescent behaviors may be related. This study examines the correlations of various risk-taking behaviors among adolescents in a rural county in upstate N.Y. For 22 towns and 2 cities in this county, demographic information and data were gathered over a 3 yr. period for the following variables: drivers in motor vehicle accidents (MVA) by sex and age group; pregnancies by age group; arrests for felonies by age group; youth leaving school before completing 12th grade by sex; and placement on probation by age and sex. All of these risk-taking behaviors among adolescents living in the entire county are positively correlated. For those417 yrs. of age the rate of pregnancies is significantly related to the rate of male drivers yrs. in MVA's (p4.03), rate of yrs. arrested for felonies (p 4.001) and the rate of males placed on probation (p 4.0001) and the rate of 16 and 17 yr. old females who drop out of school{p L.05). It is interesting to note that the larger of the two cities (with 9000 teens) has consistently lower rates of adolescent risk taking behaviors than does the smaller city (3000 teens), except for male school drop-outs. Perhaps the most surprising finding is that the rate of teen pregnancies is negatively correlated with the proportion of adult females who have no high school education. This study points out the desirability of replacing the categorical approach to adolescent problems with an holistic one. RENIN Criteria by which adolescents can be cateqorized as havinq hypertension(HBP) associated with suppressed, normal, hiqh or hyperresponsive plasma renin activity(PRA) have been established in a clinical research center settinq. Confidence bands(95%) for the four-hour upriqht PRA 4.5\u00b12.l(S.D.) nq/Mg/hr in relation to the 24 hour urinary sodium excretion(renin-sodium index)were established in 30 nonnotensive adolescents. An oral Lasix(l ml/ko) stimulation test to induce acute volume depletion was used to establish criteria for suppressed(increase<40\\)and hyperresponsive On the basis of the renin sodium index a high PRA was documented in 16' of 43 children with essential and 84% of 25 children with renal related HBP. Following Lasix stimulation PRA was suppressed in 11% and hyperresponsive in 14% of the children with essential HBP. Although the fractional increase in PRA in children with high PRA associated with either essential or renal related HBP was similar, it was less than (p<0.05) that observed in either normotensives or in those with normoreninemic essential HBP.",

The availability of such data has permitted us to make rational decisions concerning the nature of additional studies, as well as enabling cardiovascular risk factors to be identified and followed. Also, such studies can be easily performed in an outpatient milieu. One million adolescents become pregnant each year. several authors have noted that pregnant teenagers are at hiqh risk of illness and emotional disruption both pre and postpartum. A comprehensive pregnancy program was established to determine if such complications to adolescents and their babies could be reduced by providing multidisciplinary care for teenagers through pregnancy and with their infants for 12 mos. subsequent to delivery. The program was based at a municipal hospital within a medically underserved and economically depressed urban environment. Prenatal, obstetrical, postpartum and infant care were delivered by a team of a nurse coordinator, obstetrician, pediatrician, social worker, visiting nurse and psychiatrist. There were 306 adolescents (ages 12-16) and 229 infants cared for over a period of 2 yrs. Muternal complications included preeclampsia 2.9%, anemia 13.7%, Cesarean section 5.5%, premature birth postpartum endometritis 2.6t, and postpartum depression 1.3% of the 229 infants followed for 12 mos., 4 had congenital anomalies, 3 were abused; and 17 required hospitalization for various illnesses. 133 (58\\) completed their immunizations. There were two neonatal deaths. These results demonstrate a far lower incidence of complications in these adolescents and their infants than has been previously reported. It would appear that a comprehensive multidisciplinary pregnancy program can contribute markedly to the reduction of morbidity and mortality in the high risk adolescent and her infant. The computerized records of 950 consecutive new patients seen in a free adolescent clinic over a 3 year period were reviewed for compliance with initially scheduled follow-up visits. Follow-up visit.s were scheduled in the clinic for 248 new p.ltients. Patients returning within two weeks of their scheduled date were considered to have complied. Using these criteria 134 (54%) appointments were kept. The following factors were analyzed as predictors of compliance: agP, race, school and employment status, living arrangements, location of residence, number of parents at home, whether sexually active, taking any medication, use of cigarettes, alcohol or marijuana, and contraception usage. In addition the number of patient identified presenting problems and the nature of patient and physician identifi<.>d problems analyzed. None of the demographic data showed a significant correlation with compliance. A significant association (p <: .01) was shown between compliance and the number of problems initially identified by the patient. Patients presenting for routine examinations without identified problems had significantly poorer compliance (34%) than those with one (50%) or two or more (64%) problems. One patient identified problem, possible pregnancy, was found to be a significant (p<:; .05) negative predictor of compliance. These data identify specific adolescent patient groups where poor compliance can be expected. Additional reinforcement in these groups may be useful.",

In order to assess the psychologi-:al and cognitive implications of these changes evaluation was )erformed on 11 anorexic patients (9 females, 2 males, ages 12 to 20 years, mean age 15.9 years) to ascertain cognitive, memory, perceptual-motor and personality status.

Seven of these nine high functioning patients had moderate to severe cerebral atrophy on CT Scans (78%). Two additional patients with markedly abnormal CT Scans scored in very impaired ranges, but both had learning problems and school failure antedating the onset of anorexia by years. On tests of personality status 8 patients (73%) tested as mi Idly to severely depressed on the Beck Depression Inventory (Scores 11 to 43, Mean=23.8). Six of 10 patients showed markedly elevated MMPI scores consistent with personality pathology including depression. Five exhibited peak elevation (T-Scores 74-103, Mean=88) on the schizophrenia scale. Overall most patients remained cognitively intact, but the majority had significant depression and personality aberrations. Because of pediatricians' concern for pregnant adolescents, a group of 497 very young mothers age 13-15 years were compared to mothers 16 to 19 and 20 to 40 years by analyzing 22 factors for neonatal outcome, parturitional performance, obstetrical risk and physical characteristics. The data were derived from 6282 primiparous births over the past four years. Among factors studied were birthweight, gestational age, Apgar score, morbidity, mortality, presentation, length of labor, instrumentation, C-section, preeclampsia, cephalopelvic disproportion, premature rupture of membranes, maternal height, prepregnancy weight and weight gain during pregnancy. Analysis of variance tests showed no differences by age in maternal height and weight gain.",

Literature suggesting that adolescent gravidae are at high risk may be based on data uncontrolled for parity. 28 FETAL OUTCOME -IS ADOLESCENT PREGNANCY A RISK FACTOR? Barry Zuckerman, Joel J. Alpert, Elizabeth Dooling, Edgar Oppenheimer, Ralph Hingson, Suzette Morelock, and Herb Kayne (spon. by Jeffrey B. Gould). Boston Univ. Sch. Med., Boston City Hosp., Depts. of Ped., Soc. Med. Sci.Boston A study of maternal health and fetal development in a low SES population at Boston City Hospital rrovided an opportunity to explore whether(l)infants born to primiparous adolescents exhibit poorer outcome at birth than infants born to primiparous nonadolescents; and(2) if the outcome is poorer, whether the cause is adolescent status or other heal th habits or life situations. Four study pediatricians performed all physical and Dubowitz examinations without knowledge of the mothers' age. The birth weight, length, head circumference, length of gestation, Apgar scores and birth trauma of 275 infants of adolescent mothers (3-18 yrs) were compared at birth to 423 infants of nonadolescent mothers (19-30 yrs) . The only difference noted was that infants of adolescents \u20221<:ighed 94 grams less (p.S,. .03) than the infants of nonadolescents. Since the adolescents and nonadolescents differed on many characteristics which might affect fetal outcome, 23 factors were entered into a multiple regression analysis as variables. Health factors such as prepregnancy weight and weight gain, use of x-rays during pregnancy and marijuana use were independently and significantly (p_s.01) associated with birthweight. Adolescent status was not independently associated with birthweight or any other growth or clinical risk parameter. Some of the health factors are amenable to clinical intervention and represent a greater risk to pregnancy outcomes than whether or not the mother is adolescent. This study documents the of non-fatal crash and noncrash events during a 16 mth data collection effort in 9 hospital emergency rooms located in one California county. Data were obtained from a standardized protocol and medical records (n=621). The Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) was used to grade injuries and the Injury Severity Score (ISS) was calculated. Comparisons of the mechanisms and severity of injuries between crash and noncrash events are described. Subsequent analysis indicates that approximately 12% of the children presenting to emergency rooms with motor vehicle related injuries were involved in non-crash events. Age-related differences between crash and non-crash children were significant in that younger children were primarily involved in the non-crash event. The mechanism producing the injury also differed between crash and non-crash children: while interior impact was the primary injury producing mechanism in both events, a much higher percentage of ejections occurred in the non-crash event (41% vs. 5%). ISS did not differ significantly between non-fatal crash and non-crash children, [x2 (p) = 0.11].",

A semistructured interview with parents (43 mothers and 29 fathers) focused upon family parent-child interactions, sibling and peer relationships, and medical issues related to CF. Parents' responses were coded by two independent raters to identify \"major problems,\" \"minor or \"no problems.\" Out of the 62 questions assessing areas of potential problems, only 8 were viewed by parents as posing \"major problems\" for themselves and/or their children. Areas thus identified will be presented in detail to indicate the nature of the problems. The impact of hospitalization was the most prevalent concern: 60% of mothers and 58% of fathers identified this as a \"major problem.\" Issues included uncertainty regarding the outcome (34%), separation from the child (25%), and other pressing family responsibilities (16%). Communication between the parents was considered a \"major problem\" by 28% of mothers, but only 3% of fathers. Ten to 15% of parents described problems regarding their marital relationship, accepting the illness, feeling they should do more for their CF child, feeling their other children had been deprived or complained about inattention, or their relationship with the ill child's grandoarents. These data indicate that most CF families are coping successfully with the impact of a serious chronic illness, but that health-care professionals should be alert to areas of The relationship between inadequate nutrition in early infancy and subsequent brain growth and development has been reported. To determine the extent of this relationship, we studied 19 high risk, very low birthweight, premature infants (mean :!: SD birth wt \u2022\u2022 97 :!: .19 kg, gest. age 29 :!: 2 wks) requiring intensive care management during the neonatal period and followed them up to 12 mos. adjusted age (AA). Nutritional status during the neonatal period was correlated with subsequent growth and development at 12 mos. AA using standard growth parameters and the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. Follow-up measurements were: wt. = 8.3 :!: 1.2 kg; length = 72.3 :!: 2.7 cm; head circumference = 45.3 :!: 1.6 cm; Mental Developmental Index (MDI) = 71.3 :!: 18.7; Psychomotor Index (PD!) = 78.4 :!: 18.1. There was an inverse correlation between the number of weeks in the neonatal period in which the caloric intake was lower than 80 cal/kg/day (r=.61, p<..Ol) and protein intake was less than 2 gm/kg/day (r=.52, p < .05) with the PD! scores. Neonatal nutrition was only weakly related to growth parameters and MDI at 12 mos. AA. The low correlation with MDI may be due to the fact that abnormalities in motor development can be identified earlier than those in mental development and therefore this correlation should be retested at older ages. This study indicates that early inadequate protein and caloric intake is associated with lower PD! scores in premature infants at 12 mos. AA and emphasizes the need for close nutritional monitoring during the critical neonatal period. The utility of primitive reflex assessment in the motormpaired child has been hindered by lack of a quantitative escription of normal reflex maturation. The Primitive Reflex rofile is a quantitative examination technique used to evaluate rimitive reflexes. Standardization data was obtained on a ohort of 381 normal infants examined serially at each well aby visit between birth and two years of age. Reflex activity enerally decreased with increasing age, although distinctive atterns of maturation were noted for individual reflexes. he Asyrrrnetric Tonic Neck Reflex was present in the majority f subjects at birth, peaked at two months, then declined teadily throughout the first year. The Tonic Labyrinthine eflex in Prone was most pronounced at four-to-six months and eclined more slowly. The Synvnetric Tonic Neck Reflex was een only in a minority of subjects between four and six months. he Moro Reflex was uniformly present at birth and was suppressed y six months. Nonsegmental Rolling (\"log rolling\"), both ead-on-body and body-on-body, was replaced by segmental rolling fter six months. Obligatory responses, seen frequently in erebral palsy children, were not seen in any reflex at any ge in this normal population. This standardized examination echnique allows primitive reflexes to be objectively assessed. . 14 children whose families constituted the exeriment;il group were from 2 to 5 years old, had been n the dietary regimen since prior to two months of ge, were of normal intelligence, and had no siblings ith PKU. Control group parents were matched for soial class, child age, birth order, and number of chidren in family; none had children with handicaps. arents of PKU children were significantly more retrictive of their children's independent functioning han were the parents of the NON-PKU Fathers nd mothers of PKU children differed in the types of estrictions they expressed. More restrictions diffrentiated the PKU fathers from the NON-PKU control roup fathers than differentiated the PKU mothers from he NON-PKU mothers. Social class, child age, and bith order were found to be significant intervening vaiables. Strong, internalized controls related to fad restrictions were noted in the PKU children in the tudy, seemingly developed as a result of parental trining strategics. Parents relied on these child conrols to enhance dietary compliance in a manner that ermitted the child more social independence. In the first phase of a multi-dimensional study of the effects of weaning from the breast on infant behavior, a maternal interview and questionnaire were developed and administered to 100 middle-class American mothers who weaned their infants during the first year of life. The major objectives of the interview and questionnaire were to provide detailed descriptive data about the human weaning process and to identify and assess the behavioral responses of infants to weaning in the first year.",

There were 10 differences in scores between male and female infants at 12 ionths of age. The sex differences found at 6 months of age are .nconsistent with the literature and suggest the need for further \u00b7esearch to determine if drug dependent women are more responsive :o male infants during the first few months of life. Overall, :hese data indicate that infants born to drug dependent women lo not suffer any demonstrable developmental sequelae during :he first year of life. Outcome of children born to drug dependent women has been an area of concern for health professionals. Previous research has been directed primarily toward identifying the medical risk factors associated with prenatal exposure to narcotic agents. This has resulted in little information regarding environmental risk factors concomitant to this population. In order to investigate the specific characteristics of these drug dependent women that are related to child rearing practices, a Knowledge of Child Development questionnaire was administered. Subjects where opiate abusing women enrolled in a comprehensive treatment program providing psychosocial and medical services as well as methadone maintenance. All of the women (N = 30) tested had a history of at least 2 years of drug abuse, an average of 11 years of education and an average age of 28 years. Of 33 test items, 14 were answered incorrectly by over 1/3 of the mothers and 6 questions were answered incorrectly by more than half. The most frequently missed questions pertained to basic developmental milestones. Mothers consistently underestimated the age by which a child should be able to walk, talk, and have the physiological maturity for toilet training. As a practical application of this information, parenting classes, within comprehensive treatment programs, should stress basic infant development in order to avoid unrealistic and inappropriate expectations that may damage mother-infant interaction.",

Preparation techniques included videotapes, coloring books, structured parent interviews, and written guidelines for parents. Dependent measures of children included: (1) self-reports of anxiety {\"fear thermometer\" rating fear of 15 aspects of hospitalization and surgery), (2) behavioral observations made by 2 independent raters on children's anxiety and cooperation during hospitalization (88% perfect agreement between the 2 raters), (3) physiological measures of anxiety (including pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, medication needs), (4) length of hospital stay, and (5) problem behaviors pre-, during, and post-hospitalization (rated by parents). Parents also rated their own anxiety during their child's hospitalization and their satisfaction following discharge. Analysis of variance and covariance indicated no differences between the 4 groups for any of the dependent measures. The data indicate that standard pre-surgery preparation does not necessarily reduce either children's or parents' anxieties or increase parental satisfaction. We conclude that such preparation should be individualized rather than standardized.

Depts.of Pediatrics and Psychiatry, Cleveland, Ohio. This study describes the prevalence and correlates of sleeping in the parental bed among healthy children between 6 months and 4 years of age. A sample of 99 children was enrolled in an interview study on the basis of well-child care appointments in representative pediatric facilities. 457. of children had slept with parents in the month preceding the interview. The prevalence of co-sleeping patterns was: never (477.);an isolated or extraordinary occurrence (87.); occasionally (>lx/month,<2x/week) (87.); part night at least twice a week (187.) ; all night at least twice a week (19%) . Children who slept with parents only in an extraordinary circumstance were not considered co-sleepers. Recent co-sleeping occurred in 737. of black and 337. of white families. Regardless of race, a co-sleeping child was significantly more likely to be over two years old, not living with the father, and tended to have a less-educated mother. Co-sleeping seemed to reflect a parental approach to sleep management of adult presence and body contact, i.e.,co-sleeping children were significantly more likely to have their bed in the parent's room, to have adult company when falling asleep, to be given body contact other than co-sleeping in response to night waking, and less likely to be put in their own sleeping place to fall asleep or to be given a bottle to hold. Night waking was more common in children who slept with parents (p=0.03), regardless of co-sleeping pattern. Few families had discussed their practices with their pediatricians. These results demonstrate that co-sleeping is common, though generally against pediatric recommendations and without pediatrician awareness. Thumbsucking and transitional object attachment have been considered normal and important aspects of young children's developing independence. To test an alternate hypothesis, that they are a function of falling asleep without adult company, a representative sample of 99 mothers of healthy children between 6 monthsand 4 years of age were interviewed. 50% of the children fell asleep with adult company, almost always the mother 1 s. The prevalence of falling asleep withcut an adult present increased only slightly over this age range, from 43% to 56%. Regardless of age, these children were significantly more likely to suck their thumbs (p=0.04) and to use a transitional object (p=0.001). Other c.nmmon behaviors when falling asleep, such as drinking a bottle or sucking a pacifier, and uncommon ones, such as crying, self-rocking, or grinding teeth, did differ in the two groups. Children who fell asleep with parental company were more likely to be rocked (p=0.02) less likely to require any special object or behavior (p=0.04). There was no difference in the prevalence of bedtime struggles or night waking. The association between falling asleep while breastfeeding and thumbsucking or transitional object use could not be determined, because only 5 children were still being nursed to sleep. The results indicate that thumbsucking and transitional object attachment are not simply normal aspects of a child's increasing independence. Rather, they may be the product of pediatric recommendations that young children fall asleep alone, advice which deviates from the practice in most human societies and our own past.",

            "text": "The extent to which the developmental outcome of very low birthweight (VLBW) infants can be predicted from neonatal assessments has been an unresolved question. In our study, 61 consecutive infants weighing less than 1500 gms at birth were examined at 40 weeks post-con,:eptiona] age (PCA) with CT scans and the Einstein Neonatal Neurobehavioral Assessment Scale (ENNAS). Subsequent ueurobehavioral development was assessed at 7,12 and 18 months using the MDI and PDI scores of the Bayley Scales.CT scans were called abnormal if they showed diffuse periventricular low densities and/or other specific lesions (e.g., intracranial hemorrhage or ventricular enlargement). The ENNAS is a 22 item exam; the sum of abnormal items gave a score for each infant. A multiple linear regression was performed the CT data and ENNAS scores at liO weeks PCA with later assessments of neurobehavioral development (Bayley scores). Both the CT scan findings and the ENNAS scores were significantly related to MDI and PDI scores at 7, 12 and 18 months. In summary, either C'I' scan datn. o,. ENNAS scores at 40 weeks PCA are statistically reliable predictors of neurobehavioral development in VLBW infants over the first 18 months of life. Therefore, the availability of these two clinical assessments, both with predictive re..:..iabili ty, offers an important opportunity to determine w:1ich VLBW infants may need early intervention. Social support and stress are modifiers of a person's health status. In a chronic disease such as asthma, they have been implicated in the disease outcome.

This reformulation subsumed respectively increasing proportions of severe symptoms and replicated successfully on the other half-sample. Its elaboration gives a convenient matrix for organizing data from practice and a value free alternative to the present manifestational classification system, which adds insult to injury. Parent questionnaires eliciting data on sleeping-feeding-crying patterns in 75 3 and 6 month old babies were scored for \"intrinsic traits\", 11 level of parental conern 11 , and \"family adustment\". There were significant associations with subsequent ratings by teachers on a kindergarten performance profile. These were strongest for the 3 month old \"intrinsic traits\": \"Trouble getting to sleep\" at 3 months correlated negatively with teachers' assessments of \"leadership\" (.37), \"peer interaction\" (.41), 11 class participation\" (.41), \"communication\" (.42), and \"overall social\" (. 4 7). \"Excessive cry and \"poor consolability\" had the next most negative association (.30-.41 ). Feeding problems correlated at .23-.36. The infant sleeping-feeding-crying measures did not relate to kindergarten teachers' assessments of \"mastery\" (e.g., \"persistence\", and .. use of time\", \"conformity of routine\", and \"following directions\"). Parental overconcern during infancy and poor family adjustment to the new baby were not nearly as predictive of kindergarten social dysfunction as were \"intrinsic traits 11 \u2022 Follow-up of the 17 subjects with the greatest number of problems in infancy showed a consistently high proportion with social-emotional concerns at 30-42 months kindergarten entry. The data suggest that for a subgroup of children infantile functional disorders may be antecedents of poor social transition to school but are not predictive of difficulty with classroom competence and task mastery in kindergarten. Lack of maternal involvement in the early neonatal period is thought to be associated with later problems in the maternal-infant relationship. In order to increase a mother's interest in her transported sick newborn we developed a VP system between our ICN and one of our referring hospitals. We used a digital slow scan VP to show hospitalized mothers their infants during their phone calls.

LD were significantly more impaired than either N or G in behavioral scales assessing activity and attention independent of IQandf SES. Separation of G into high (IQ> 139) and low IQ (IQ< 139) groups indicated no differences in motor and language scales but significant differences in early state, activity, attention, impulsivity and organization, each favoring the low IQ G. There was no difference between the two G in achievement tests except that the high IQ G was superior in mathematics. Comparison of high IQ G to LD indicated no significant differences in behavior, although G continued to score better on intelligence and achievement tests. Our data suggests that highly G children may exhibit behavioral qualities that not only differ from the normal but may resemble behaviors usually associated with children at risk for learning disabilities and that the G represent a heterogeneous population -the lower IQ reflecting a continuum of the normal population, the higher IQ G representing a distinct group with superior academic and achievement functioning but behavior more representative of that usually associated with LD children.

MPH terminal half life averaged 2.5 hours, and MPH levels in a child given the same 0.3 mg/kg dose on two occasions were highly replicable, averaging 10.3 vs 10.0 ng/ ml ( 2 hours) , 8. 2 vs 8. 2 ng/ml ( 3 hours) and 12. 2 vs 13. 4 ng/ml (peak). Hyperactivity and attention improved on all doses better than placebo with the 0.3 mg/kg B.l.D. and 0.6 mg/kg daily doses producing the best response. Plasma concentrations of MPH were significantly related to clinical response, and children with ADD (H) responded better than those with ADD (no H). Plasma concentrations of MPH may be useful in assessing clinical response. Higher doses (0.3 B.I.D., or 0.6 mg/kg) are superior to lower for behavior and blood levels may be useful in explaining apparent non-response or individual differences. THE IMPACT OF NEONATAL LOSS. R. Siegel, A. Glicken, S. Henneberry, C. Cleveland, L.J. Butterfield, and R. Harmon. The Children's Hospital, Denver, Colorado. This paper will describe a research study which was designed to evaluate the impact of neonatal loss on families. An interview questionnaire was developed which allowed for assessment of how families were coping with the loss of their infant, and inquired about events surrounding their infant's death. This permitted the study of maternal grieving, as well as the effects of staff interventions on this process. A total of 38 married women were interviewed at 3 and 9 months following the loss of their infant.",

Findings showed that most families did describe their neonatal loss as having had a major impact on their functioning. It was also shown that although neonatal loss h3s significant effects on family functioning and maternal grieving, in general these effects are qreatest immediatly after loss and at 3 months and begin to lessen at 9 months following the loss. 89% of mothers reported sadn:?ss or depression at 3 months; the data showed similar differences at 3 and 9 months, respectively with 80% vs. 74% reporting their life was significantly different as a result of the loss, 29% vs. 10% reported severe marital difficulties, 47% vs. 48% financial problems, 58% vs. 28% difficulty sleeping, and 49% vs. 26% eating problems. Many mothers described the period from 2-4 months as most difficult since often family and friends became less emotionally available and expectprl them to be \"back to normal\". To determine the proportion of visits during the first years of life which were accounted for by either acute otitis media (AOM) or middle ear effusion (MEE), we studied 2568 children prospectively from birth. AOM was defined as middle ear fluid in an ill child and MEE as asymptomatic middle ear fluid. AOM or MEE was diagnosed at 17.5%, 24.0%, and 24.1% of all visits during years 1,2, and 3 of life respectively. After excluding well-baby visits, AOM or MEE was diagnosed at 32.3%, 32.1%, and 30.3% of visits during years 1,2, and 3. Of all visits made to follow-up any prior illness, visits to follow-up AOM or MEE accounted for 64.3%, 71.0, and 70.0% respectively.",

Betty R. Vohr, William Oh. Brown Univ., Women & Infants Hosp. Dept. of Ped., Providence, RI pattern, neurological & developmental performance of 21 PT SGA & 20 PT appropriate for gestational age (AGA)infants matched for birth weight, socio-economic status and date of birth were prospectively studied. 19/21 SGA (90%) & 15/20 AGA (75%) of infants born in 1975 and 1 76 were followed yearly for 5 yrs. SGA mean b.wt. (M\u00b1SD) was 1220\u2022195g and AGA 1195\u00b1190g. At 5 yrs. of age, mean wt. and length of SGA infants remained at the 3rd-10th% compared to 2Sth-50th \\ for AGA. Mean head circumferences, however,were comparable for both groups and were at the 25th-50th \\. Neurological assessments showed 2 SGA cases with mild spastic diplegia(l0%)and l AGA infant with spastic diplegia. The ns ns SGA infants have significantly lower DQ scores than AGA controls at 1-3 yr.; however, both SGA and AGA infants gradually make developmental gains. Developmental 11 catch up\" for AGA infants occurs by 12 mo. in contrast to 4-5 yrs. for SGA. Overall neurodevelopmental outcome was good despite the fact that these data reveal early developmental delay of PT SGA infants with late \"catch up\" by 4-5 yrs., stressing the importance of long term follow up to accurately assess outcome. Physicians' social and moral values are important to the extent they influence decisions in patient care. This study compares pediatricians\u2022 and non-pediatricians\u2022 attitudes and behavior in medical practice. A sample of 178 USF School of Medicine physicians (13 pediatric: 45 non-pediatric residents; 20 pediatric: 100 non-pediatric faculty) were surveyed concerning patients' rights to free choice, patients' rights to refuse treatment, national health care, equity in allocating medical care, abortion, and treatnoent of handicapped children. Siqnificant differences {p<.05) were found between pediatricians 0 and non-pediatricians' attitudes toward suicide, abortion, belief in an afterlife, and equity in allocating medical resources. Pediatric residents and faculty did not support patients' rights to choose suicide or abortion. Pediatric residents would perform life-saving surgery on a Uown's syndrome infant, while nonpediatric residents would not. Pediatric residents and faculty were more likely to encourage continuance of an unwanted pregnancy than were non-pediatricians. Pediatricians showed a greater tendency to employ religious values in making decisions than non-pediatricians. These findings suggest that for this sample pediatricians differ from other specialists in their ethical beliefs and that their decisions involving patient care reflect these differences. To examine the emotional impact of the death of a twin on 1others and fathers, a study was conducted comparing the reponses of eight sets of parents who lost a twin with eight sets 1f parents who lost a singleton newborn. In each group the 1abies had a mean gestational age of 31 weeks and the mean length 1f time between the death and survey completion was 15 months. \"he mean age at death was 2.8 days for the twins and 10.5 days 'or the singletons. The parents completed a questionnaire which :overed their emotional reactions and social interactions during :he first six weeks fo 11 owing the loss and their present .ponse. Analyses of variance indicated that although mothers ex->erienced more depressive symptoms than fathers (p .001) and :hat symptoms diminished over time (p = .032), there was no siglificant difference between the responses of parents who lost a :win and those who lost a singleton. All of the mothers and 80% Jf the fathers of twins report being told by others to feel Fortunate for having a living twin, yet 60% of these parents re-Jort experiencing a physical longing to be with their baby Following his/her death and continue to frequently think of their Jead twin. No parent of a surviving twin reported prefering no!_ :o discuss their baby's death. These findings indicate that the !xistence of a living twin does not lessen parental grief and :hose care for these families should be aware of this fact is they counsel parents in their bereavement.

NBAS This study describes the interaction of fathers w:ilth preterm infants, and compares it to mothers' interactions with preterm infants and the interactions of lx>th parents with fullterm infants. Parent-child interactions at 5 months are related to perinatal complications and to developmental outcome at 18 months. Ten preterm and ten fullterm infants were recruited as newborns with their parents, and followed lonqitudinally until they were 18 months post-term conceptual aqe. At 5 months post term, all infants were videotaped durinq 3-minute en-face interactions with each parent. Episodes of play defined as \"games 11 were subsequently coded. While mothers and fathers did not differ significantly in overall number of games played with fullterm infants, with preterm infants fathers played significantly fewer games than did mothers (P<0.02). In particular, fathers played significantly fewer non-arousinq (verbal/visual vs. tactile/limb-movement) games (p<0.05). The data suggest that fathers adapted to the stress of the preterm infant by decreasing the number of games they play. Cross-time correlations showed different patterns of relationships for preterm infants' interaction with mothers and fathers. Healthier premature infants played fewer arousinq games with mothers (r=.75), but not with fathers. Althouqh fathers qenerally played a more indirect role, nevertheless the number of nonarousinq games both parents played was more highly correlated with 18-rnonth Bayley psychornotor scores (r=.67) than that of either parent alone.

IVe have reexamined the traditional views that a) the 2 ventricles are developmentally separate and distinct entities, and b) the muscular interventricular septum (MJVS) is, from its beginning, a discrete structure separating the 2 primitive ventricles. Sixty dissected chick embryo hearts were studied at different stages of development with scanning electron microscopy. Ventricular trabeculations (TR) develop rapidly beginning at stage (ST) 17 days). These appear morphologically as superior plates and columnar trabeculations. At ST 21 days), the TR become denser in the ostium bulbi region where the superior plates begin to adhere to each other at ST 26 (5 days) to form the sinus septum. Fusion of adhering TR proceeds in a cranio-caudal direction producing the MIVS, and is complete by ST 30 days). Remnants of opposing TR endocardial surfaces were identified as intraseptal channels. We suggest that persistence of these channels may result in single or multiple muscular ventricular septa! defects. The formation of the MIVS from preexisting TR suggests that the 2 ventricles arc not necessarily separate developmental entities but arise by division of a single, primitive ventricular chamber. Our findings have implications to the concept of univentricular hearts: the ventricular chamber in single ventricle represents the persistent primitive chamber which should not be identified to be anatomically left ventricle or right ventricle. M-mode echocardiography (MME}, electrocardiography (ECG) and graded exercise testing (GXT) were utilized to assess left ventricular function in children with prosthetic aortic valves (AoV). Since 1964, there have been 15 survivors of isolated AoV replacement, aged 11-19.5 yrs (16.3 yrs). All but 2 are asymptomatic (1 has residual aortic insufficiency (AI) and 1 severe obstruction). Each patient (pt) had abnormal GXT's and MME's prior to AoV replacement. Resting ECG's, 2 months-2yrs post-operatively (PO}, revealed that 10 (67%) had LV hypertrophy, 2 (13%) had signs of healed anterolateral myocardial infarction and 2 (13%) had residual ST-T wave changes. Nine pts had GXT's 2 months-12yrs (3:6 yrs) PO. Six (67%) had an abnormal blood pressure response with maximum exercise (ME), 7 (78%) had working capacities <70% of the expected norma 1 va 1 ue and 2 had abnorma 1 ST segment changes ( >2mm depression) with ME. MME in 12 of the 15 pts one month-13yrs PO demonstrated LV enlargement in 6 (50%), abnormal septa! motion in 6 (50%) and LV free wall and/or septal thickness >2 SD above expected normals in 11 (92%), The LV systolic time intervals and percent shortening (%5) were abnormal in 7 pts. Children with predominant AI had the worst LV recovery rate. All 4 had persistently dilated, thick LV's on MME and abnormal %S. Persistent LV dysfunction is noted in the majority of the children after prosthetic AoV implantation. Early intervention, particularly in children with AI may improve the long-term outcome.",

PD examination with the Doppler ;ample volume (DSV) positioned in the main pulmonary artery revealed 2 pts with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow.

The The effect of left atrial (LA) stimulation on refractory periods (RP) and A-V nodal conduction (A-H) have not been previously reported in children (C). Indirect measurements from coronary sinus stimulation have been obtained in adults with dysrhythmias (D). Ten C (8 preoperative and 2 postoperative) with congenital heart defects and with no evidence of D were evaluated electrophysiologically by atrial extrastimulation at the same cycle length (CL) (500 msec) from both the right atrium (RA) and LA. The LA was stimulated directly through an interatrial conununication. Rapid RA pacing was also performed. The effective RP of the RA and LA ranged between 130-240 msec; and 100-250 msec respectively. The functional RP of the RA and LA ranged between 210-320 msec; and 140-280 msec respectively. There was no significant difference between the RP for RA and LA by thP. paired \"t\" test. Atrial refractoriness was reached first preventing evaluation of A-V nodal RP in 7 C. The A-H intervals measured from RA and LA stimulation at a CL of 500 msec ranged between 70-120 msec; and 55-105 msec respectively. The A-H interval was significantly shortened by LA stimulation (p<0.05). Our findings indicate that in C the site of atrial stimulation has no significant effect on atrial RP and A-V nodal conduction is significantly shortened when evaluated by LA stimulation. Shortened A-H intervals on LA stimulation can be explained by earlier entry into the lower A-V node from the LA with retrograde conduction to the low RA. Conduction disturbances are common in children with Marfan's syndrome, but the occurrence of serious ventricular arrhythmia has not been stressed.

We measured heart rate, mean dorsal aortic blood flow !O'J and mean arterial blood pressure (15') in 160 white Leghorn chick embryos on day 3 (stage 18), day 3. 5 (stage 21 I, day 4 (stage 24) and day 5 (stage 27) of incubation. Dorsal aortic blood velocity was measured with a 20 MHz pulsed-doppler flow meter using a 1 mm piezoelectric crystal positioned at a 45\u00b0 angle to the dorsal aorta. Dorsal aortic diameter was measured with a micrometer eyepiece and blood flow was calculated. In-vitro correlation, the velocity meter was linear (y=.85x+1.19, r=.99) over a range of 1 to 20 mm/sec. Mean arterial blood pressure was measured with a servonull pressure system from a 5 micrometer tip diameter cannula inserted in the right vitelline artery. In-vitro correlation of the pressure system was linear (y=lx-.24, r=.99) Rhesus hemolytic anemia, although observed less frequently since the introduction of Rhogam, still presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to the clinician. In severely affectea pregnancies, unless intrauterine (JUT) is initiated, fetal hydrops can develop with ensuing death. From an ongoing study of 250 high risk pregnancies, the pericardia! space of 13 Rh-sensitized fetuses was imaged witl1 two-dimensional-directed M-moae echocardiography (20-MM)and evaluated for evioence of a PE. When present, the PE occurreo as early as 20 weeks of gestation and its presence preceded the appearance of ascites, soft tissue edema, or pleural effusion as manifest by ultrasound. In three fetuses the PE resolved following !UT. One fetus, in which the PE was diagnosed 4B hours prior to birth, was noted to have the PE on neonatal echocardiographic examination following birth.",

These data suggest that late occurring dys remain a problem after the Mustard procedure even if sinus node trauma at the time of surgery is minimized. Progressive scarring along baffle suture lines may be an explanation. The metabolic and hemodynamic effects of acute propranolol (P) administration (I mg/kg IV) prior ta ischemia were studied in dogs subjected to 20 min of normothermic global ischemia on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Pre CPB ATP levels in P dogs were similar to levels in control (C) dogs (4.95+0.14 umoles/g wet wt). On CPB during reperfusion ATP levels were better preserved with P treatment (table). P treatment did not alter heart rate (HR), mean aortic pressure (AO, data not shown), myocardial oxygen consumption (MV0 2 ) or left ventricular blood flow (BF Post CPB ATP levels in P dogs recovered better and reached 80% of preischemic levels. AO pressure was similar in the two groups and P dogs came off CPB more smoothly with fewer arrhythmias.

Most (87%) were <s years old. There was a 2:1 male dominance. Frequent accompanying symptoms were otitis, arthritis, and diarrhea. Jaundice and neurological involvement rarely occurred but were twice as frequent in patients with CA.

            "text": "EXPERIMENTAL BASIS FOR BALLOON VALVULOPLASTY OF CON-GENITAL PULMONARY VALVULAR STENOSIS. Jean S, Kan, John I!. Anderson, Robert I. White, Jr. The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland 21205 Balloon angioplasty has successfully been used to open stenotic blood vessels, The feasibility of applying this technique to congenital pulmonary valvular stenosis has not been previously assessed. In an effort to assess the hemodynamic response of the hypertrophied right ventricle (RV) to temporary balloon occlusion, 6 dogs were prepared by banding of the pulmonary artery. Hemodynamic responses to acute balloon occlusion of the pulmonary artery were studied in the 6 banded dogs 3 months after banding, and in 5 control dogs. The following hemodynamic parameters were measured during incremental periods of balloon occlusion of the pulmonary artery: RV systolic pressure (RVSP), RV end diastolic pressure (RVEDP), femoral artery pressure (FAP), cardiac output <(CO) by dye dilution, and electrocardiogram, MEAN PRESSURE VALUES MEASURED DURING BALLOON OCCLUSION (m.\"11Hg) CONTROL BANDED RVSP (initial) RVSP (peak) 68 116 RVEDP (max) 21 23 RVSP in both groups peaked at 10 sec after occlusion while RVEDP rose gradually during the occlusion. At occlusion intervals of less than 120 sec, predominately reversible supraventricular arrhythmias were noted. These results suggest that temporary complete occlusion of the pulmonary artery, as would occur during balloon valvuloplasty, is well tolerated by the hypertrophied right ventricle. (1.94, 1.81) . RV and LV ejection fract\\ons were normal. At surgery (19 Gp A, 11 Gp B), ASD size was comparable in NI vs Ab!. However, mean age of NI was less than Abl (3.3 vs 7.4, p < 0.02). Abl SN-AYN was found in 0/10 at age 0.6-2.2, in 7/11 at age 2.5-5, and 6/9 at> 6 yrs. Our study strongly suggests age-related dysfunction of SN-AVN, starting to appear after age 2 yrs. This has obvious therapeutic implications. The effect in hypoxemic newborn dogs (Pa02<38 torr) of an acute infusion (over 5') of NaHC03 or NaCl (2meq/kg diluted 1:1 with D5W) were studied on cardiac output (C.O.) and its distribution using radioactive microspheres \u2022 Control animals received an infusion of equal volume of D5W. There was no difference between the groups prior to the infusion in any of the parameters measured. There was no change in heart rate, BP, systemic vascular resistance or distribution of C.O. following any of the infusions. Cardiac output and stroke volume increased in animals receiving NaHC03 but not in those receiving an equiosmolar load of NaCl. NaHC03 in the hypoxic newborn has an inotropic effect which is not explained by hyperosmolarity and plasma expansion. Torsades de pointes (TP)-multiform ventricular tachycardia-has not been reported in children or adolescents and only rarely has it been described in adults. During intracardiac electrophysiologic studies (EPS) to evaluate suspected or documented ventricular (V) tachycardia (T), TP was induced in 3 pts who had normal QT intervals and no evidence of metabolic disorders. EPS included single (S1 ), double (S2S3) and bursts (B) of V stimuli. Pt l (16 yrs old) had nonsustained (NS) multiform VT-cycle length (Cl) 300 msec-on Holter (H) without symptoms (sx) but had sustained (S) TP (Cl 220) induced by B. After procaineamide (PA), NS TP occurred and Cl \u2022 to 200. Because of \u2022 LV function (probably 2\u00b0 to myocarditis) digoxin was given and no VT recurred. Pt 2 (13 yrs old) had Rastelli repair of V inversion, pulmonary stenosis/VSD at age 7. Couplets were found on H; S TP (Cl 185) was induced by B. During serial EPS, S TP was induced after quinidine (Cl 200), NS TP after propranolol (Cl 260), and none after phenytoin. Pt 3 (17 yrs old) with normal heart had bidirectional VT on H (Cl 350) unaccompanied by sx. TP (Cl 200) was induced by B which converted to V fibrillation. NS TP were induced during serial EPS after PA (Cl 250), quinidine (Cl 300, 150), and phenytoin, but propranolol prevented TP. We conclude that inducible TP during EPS in the young has variable characteristics regarding pt population, underlying heart disea>e. and response to therapy. Serial drug EPS are useful to document therapeutic effect. EFFECT ----vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and Suhstance P(SP) may be neurotransmitters in the \"pept i dergi c 11 nervous system. They occur in the lung, but their effects on newborn pulmonary vascular resistance(PVR) are unknown. Flow probes were placed around the L and R pulmonary arteries(PA) of 3-18 day old lamhs; catheters were placed in the aorta(Ac) and either LorRPA5-12days later. Bolus injections of 0.1-\u00b5g/kgofV!Pand SP were made into either PA of unsedated lambs in normoxia(N) and hypoxia(ll). Land RPA flows, Ao and PA pressures (AoP, PAP in mmllg) were recorded continuol!sly. A direct effect on l'VR of VII' or SP results in a change in the ratio of flow into the injected lung over total pulmonary flow (Qinj/Q\u00b71). VIP(n=8) is a direct pulmonary vasodilator COinj/Qr increasing from 0.49 to 0.52*) at a very low dose(O.l\u00b5g/kg). VIP also lowers AoP(84 to 77*) and increases cardiac output (CO: 1.17 to I .42 L/min*) at the same dose, indicating systemic vasodilation. Similarcffc\u2022:ts were seen with II and propranolol (!mg/kg). In contrast, SP(n=6) had variable effects: it increased CO and AoP at l.O\u00b5g/kg, hut increased Oinj/QTonly in II, only transiently, and only at low dose (0.3\u00b5g/kg). At IO \u00b5g/kg, SI' caused marked agitation. Ncith<'r agent showed selectivity as a PA (as opposed to a systemic) vasodilator.",

Detailed review of the clinical course in these 8 infants(group A) was done and compared to the 15 other infants(group B) who did not have diffuse thrombi on autopsy. Diagnoses in group A were: pneumonia and sepsis-4, meconium inhalation-3, primary PPHN-1; and group B: pneumonia and sepsis-4, meconium inhalation-4, primary PPHN-4, hyaline membrane disease-2, diaphragmatic hernia-1. The only significant differences between the two groups were the response to tolazoline infusion as assessed by in and the platelet counts. Group A responded less favorably to tolazoline (14.8 rrmHg vs 83.6 mmHg; P'0.05) and had lower platelet counts (5l ,000/1r.m3 vs 128,000/mm3; p<0.01) than group B. No significant differences could be detected in Apgar scores, duration or mode of mechanical ventilation, oxygen requirements, arterial blood g3s tensions or pH, systemic arterial blood pressure, coagulation profile or amount of blood product transfusions. Pulmonary microthrombi should be added to the list of mechanisms for PPHN and may explain why some infants do not respond well to therapeutic efforts aimed at vasodilation. Thrombocytopenia and failure to respond to pulmonary vasodilators should suggest the diagnosis. EXERCISE Although decreased renal BF may underlie CO-associated hypertension both pre-and postop, the impact of CO relief and or exercise(EX) on regional BF hasn't been studied. We made jl1xtaductal COs in 8 newborn(3-8 day) lambs; 3 lambs(CONT) had thoracotomies without Ao narrowing. After 6-9wks of recovery, cardiac output and BF distribution were measured by LA infusion of radiolabel led 15\u00b5 spheres. Treadmill EX(l.6-3 MPH) was performed for 7-9min; BF studies were repeated at 4-5min of EX (PRE-CO). Five lambs then had balloon dilation(BD) of COs using our previously described method, and rest and EX studies were repeated the next day(POST-CO). BD increased CO diameter(5.l to decreased systolic gradient (39 to 8mmllg*) and restored normal U4%) BP in each lamb. In all three groups, EX increased HR*(46-61%) and cardiac output*(60-72%) hy \u2022imilar amounts. Although the EX-induced rise in mean Ao pressure was only 2-4% in CONT and PRE-CO Iamhs, Ao pressure rose 26'.%*(87 to l lOmmHg) with EX in POST-CO lambs, suggesting that EX-induced vasodilation is impaired after CO relief. ltl all lambs, cerebral BF was normal at rest and on GI and liv\u00b7 er BF fell similarly on EX.

Alloxan was given to pregnant rabbits on the 14th day of gestation. Studies were performed on the isolated arterially perfused heart of FDM (n=l7) and normal fetuses (NF) (n=l5) at 28 days of gestation, and the data were compared with those obtained in the normal newborn (NNB) (n=44}. Parameters of mechanical function were recorded at various extracellular calcium (Ca) in the three groups. At 1.5 mM Ca (control), the developed tension, maximal rate of tension development [+dT/dt (max)], resting tension (RT), time to peak tension (TPT), and half time to relaxation(l/2 TR) were similar in the three groups. The maximal inotropic effect [+dT/dt (max)] of Ca was observed at 7.5 mM in Nf, at 15 mM in FDM, and at 30 mM in Ntl8. The inotropic effect at 15 mM Ca in the FDM 1144 t 18% of control) was significantly greater than that in the NF (81 \u00b1 12%) but was not significantly different from that in NNB (158 12%). At 30 mM Ca. significant increases in the RT and 1/2 TR were observed in NF, but not in FDM. Thus in FDM, the inotropic effect of Ca was greater and the toxic effect of high Ca was less than in NF. These data indicate that l) the capability of Ca sequestration in the heart of FDM and NNB is greater than in NF, and 2) maternal diabetes causes significant changes in development of excitation-contraction coupling in the fetal heart.

CT was studied in RBCs of children with primary (1\u00b0) HPT and secondary (2\u00b0) HPT with comparison to age-weight-sex-and race-matched normotensive controls. Results show a significant increase in the Li-Na CT flux in children with HPT compared with controls, The mean CT(\u00b1S.D.) for each group is shown below in mMLi/liter RBCs/hr. Between 1977 and 1981, 23 patients (pts) with complete atrioventricular canal (C.A.V.C.) had total repair. Five pts died (21. 7%). At autopsy, 4 had a small right ventricle (RV) and 1 had a small left ventricle (LV). Three pts with C.A.V.C. and a small RV have not been submitted for operation (op). In these 7 pts with a small RV (Group S) the RV/LV diastolic ratio (Rd) byM-mode echocardiography (echo) was 0.25-0.35 (mean 0.29 \u00b1 0.03SD), while the Rd in 18 op survivors with adequate echoes was 0.42-1.2 (mean 0.74 \u00b1 0.21SD). Two-dimensional echo in Group S was suggestive of a small RV in 5 pts, equivocal in 1, and inadequate in the 7th. Angiography (Ang) in Group S was distinct from that in balanced C.A.V.C., showing hypoplasia of the trabecular portion of the RV with a normal outflow tract and a normal or large pulmonary artery (PA). In contrast, the 18 survivors had a large LV and a normal or large RV and PA. The pt with the small LV had an echo Rd of 2.3 and by Ang a large RV and PA, small LV, and sub-aortic narrowing. Age, systemic/pulmonary flow ratio, systemic/pulmonary resistance ratio, and RV/LV systolic pressure (RVP/LVP) ratio were similar in the survivors and non-survivors. In both groups RVP/ LVP showed a significant and similar reduction immediately after repair. These data show a higher incidence of hypoplastic RV (27%) in C.A.V.C. than in most reported series. In C.A.V.C., RV or LV hypoplasia can be diagnosed by M-mode echo and Ang. In these pts the mortality of complete repair is prohibitive.",

They are seen most often in large caliber vessels in which flow is relatively slow such as the I.V.C., portal and internal jugular veins, but are seldom seen in the heart or arteries. An invitro model of a blood containing vessel was devised by placing blood in thin rubber tubing immersed in a water bath. Flow in the system was generated by means of an attached syringe and the tubing scanned with an 8 mHz small part instrument. The experiment was repeated using various mixtures consisting of (1) washed red cells suspended in .85% saline in the same concentration as in whole blood. (2) Dilutions of the washed red cell suspension (used in [1] above) with .85% saline of 1:1, 1:4, 1:100, and 1:1,000. (3) Hemoglobin solution of the same concentration as in (1) and (2) above. (4) Particle free plasma. Numerous low level echoes were noted in static and flowing blood and red cell suspensions, but not in plasma or hemoglobin. Formed elements of blood are, thus, the responsible scattering agent. Changing number and amplitude of with changing flow ratP, observed clinically, is probably related to red cell aggregation in stasis. Further improvements in ultrasound technology may allow spontaneous echogenicity of blood to be observed more consistently and used to better advantage.

            "text": "No elcctrocardiographic abnormalities or were seen. We were unable to demonstrate any loss of body protein in the first 2 wk by nitrogen balance. There was however a significant naturesis and diuresis in the first 2 wk which may have resulted in a reduced blood volume, which in turn may account for the observed reduction in ventricular wall thickness. Amiodarone is a new antiarrhythmic agent that has been shown to be effective in treating a variety of arrhythmias in both children and adults. We report our experience utilizing amiodaronc in the treatment of three children, ages 11-13 years, diagnosed as having anatomically normal hearts and ventricular arrhythmias (2 ventricular tachycardia, 1 multifocal PVC's). All 3 pts were initially treated with standard antiarrhythmic drugs (quinidine, propranolol, procainamide) and either did not respond (2/3 pts) or experienced drug toxicity (quinidine -1 pt). Amiodarone was administered in a single oral daily dose of 10 mg/kg/day x 1 week, followed by a daily maintenance dose of 5-11 mg/kg/day. All pts have shown a significant clinical response to oral amiodarone with either complete suppression of ventricular tachycardia (1 pt), abolition of multifocal PVC's (1 pt) and near complete suppression of ventricular tachycardia in the third pt (1 short run of ventricular tachycardia in 24 hr ECG). One pt has had corneal microdeposits detected by slit lamp examination and is receiving methylcellulose eye drops; no other adverse reactions have been encountered during the followup of 4 months to 3 years. ventricular arrhythmias in children are often resistant to standard drug therapy. Amiodarone may be an effective agent in those pediatric pts with primary ventricular arrhythmias in whom pharmacologic suppression is desired. Rapid injection of ionic contrast material versus non-ionic ompounds during cardiac catheterization (CC) is known to produce n t osmotic load. However, little information is available oncerning the effects of contrast on LV myocardial wall stress LVWS). Using double blind technique 20 pts. < 3 yrs. of aqe ndergoing cardiac catheterization were divided equally into roup I receivinq Diatrizoate t1eqlumine, Renoqrafin-76 (R) and roup II a non-ionic radiopaque compound Metrizamide (M). Followng baseline LV pressure (P) and echo measurement of LV interval iameter and posterior LVW in systole and diastole an LV injection as performed: Group I receiving l. 41 + . 12 cc/kg, I I l. 53 + . 18 c/kg. At one minute intervals the previous indices were recorded nd wall stress calculated for systole and diastole: (GM/CM2) p < 0. In order to assess echo criteria in defining hsPDA and correlating these criteria to risk for poor outcome, 51 VLBW infants (750-lSOOg, 27-34 wks gestational age [GA]) underwent prospective sequential clinical and echo examinations during the first month of life. Echoes were performed on days 1,2,3,5 and 7 and then once/wk. hsPDA was defined as 1) t left ventricular (LV) dimension or t left atrial dimension (LAD) or LAD/ Aorta 1.4 and 2) typical ductal murmur or t shortening fraction or\u00b0\"' LV systolic time interval ratio. 32/51 (63%) infants had hsPDA during the first wk of life (early) and did not differ from those without hsPOA in BW or GA. However, infants with early hsPDA had lower Apgar scores (p<0.05) and were more likely to require ventilator support for RDS (p<0.05). A murmur was not audible in 21/32 (66%) infants with early hsPDA. These infants with silent ducts did not differ from infants with murmurs in BW, GA, 5 min Apgar or outcome (duration of ventilation, incidence of BPD). Infants who required ventilator support for RDS with early hsPDA needed ventilation for a mean of 13.8\u00b19.4 days, whereas those without early hsPDA needed ventilation for 3.3\u00b12.6 days (p<.001). Infants with early hsPDA had a higher incidence of BPD and/or death than infants without early hsPDA -17/32 vs 4/19 respectively, p<0.03. Therefore, the above criteria for hsPDA are useful in identifying the\u00b7VLBW infant at risk for poor outcome. Early differentiation of sick newborns (NB) with critical congenital heart disease (CHO) from those with non-cardiac illness is essential to the appropriate management of these patients. Linear array two-dimensional echocardiography (LA2DE) provides a technically simple, portable method for assessing cardiac anatomy in NB. Resolution is excellent. LA2DE characteristics of the great arteries were evaluated in 51 consecutive sick NB referred for possible CHO. The median age was one day (0-7) and median weight was 3.2 kg (2.5-4.1). The ratio of the diameters of the large-to-small great vessels was calculated. 24 NB with a ratio greater than 1.4 had CHO with a large shunt in either direction. Of the 27 NB in whom the ratio was less than 1.2, 10 had parallel great arteries (transposition of great arteries), and 17 had normally related great arteries. Of the 17 with normally related great arteries, 6 had a thickened and poorly mobile semilunar valve, and 11 had no evidence of cardiac abnormality. LA2DE findings were confirmed by subsequent cardiac catheterization in all 40 patients with CHO and by clinical course or autopsy in the 11 with no evidence of CHO. Thus, LA2DE is an excellent tool for physicians caring for sick NB to use in non-invasive assessment to distinguish cardiac from non-cardiac disease. Left heart anatomy in 22 heart specimens from infants with TAPVD was compared to normal specimens matched by age, crown-heel length and brain weight. Thicknesses were measured with a Fowler micrometer; lengths and circumferences with needlepoint dividers; diameters with a graduated cone; and atrial surface areas (estimate of volume) with a tablet digitizer after pressing endocardial surfaces against plate glass. Two observers independently graded the left contour of the ventricular septum as 2+ or 1+ concave (normal) and flat or l+ convex (indicating mild to moderate displacement into left ventricular cavity). Sets of observations were 90% reliable by linear regression (least squares method). Differences between normal and TAPVD specimens were determined by the Student's T test. The left ventricle in TAPVD was longer (p= .OS) and wider (p=.001) than normal. The septum was displaced into the left ventricular cavity in 18 specimens (including newborns, p=.001); this suggests that right ventricular preponderance and compression of LV cavity is not always due to increased pulmonary flow after birth. Length of left atrium was decreased from normal (p=.05) and surface area diminished (p=.001). We conclude that left ventricular cavity in TAPVD may be abnormal in shape. Since left atrium is smaller than normal, appropriate efforts should be made to maximize its effective size at time of surgical correction. In order to evaluate the role of 2D echo for identifying complex MV and TV anatomy, we studied 22 patients who had an overriding atriovcntricular valve identified on angiography. Eleven had anatomic verification at autopsy (n=S), or at surgery (n=6). Of 13 with inlet VSD, TVO was subclassified by 2D echo as TVO without straddling in 7, (4 confirmed anatomically), and TVO wiLh straddling in 6, 1 confirmed anatomically. TVO was best evaluated on 4 chamber views. Ventricular inversion in 4 p:1tients or criss-cross heart in 2 did not preclude diagnosis. Three patients had MVO and 2, 1 with and l without straddling, were verified anatomically. Short axis views best delineated MV relationsl1ips Lo a more anterior subarterial VSO. Six patients had single ventricle of right ventricular type and a portion of a common AV valve which overrode and straddled into an inferior-posterior blind trabecular pouch, a relationship verified in 4 anatomically. Our study relates the angiographic and echocardiographic views used for evaluation of valve overriding and suggests that angiography and 20 echo arc complementary techniques for diagnosing overriding atrioventriclJlar valves. In addition, 21> echo can identify chordal attachments to the septum or those crossing the ventricular septal defect and associated with straddling. Valdes-Cruz, Theron W. Ovitt, Stanley J. Goldberg, Hugh D. Allen, Jack G. Copeland, Robert B. Mammana, Univ. of Az., Depts. of Pediatrics, Surgery and Radiology, Tucson This st11dy combined the use of 2D echo and DVSA in 3 patients with double aortic arcl1 and 4 patients with aortic coarctation who subsequently underwent s11rgical correction without cardiac caLheterization. In the 3 children with double aortic arch (ages 4 months to 7 years), the 20 echo corroborated the absence of associated cardiac abnormalities. Additionally, a subcostal left ventricular outflow tract view could be developed which showed the aortic bifurcation high above the aortic valve and the proximal portion of both limbs of the double aortic arch. In the 4 patients with coarctation of tl1e aorta (age 6-11 yrs), clinical examination and 2D echo confirmed nonstenotic bicuspid aortic valve in all 4, and a small v0ntricular septnl defect associated with a ventricular septa] aneurysm in 1. Suprasternal nc>tcl1 ecl10 viPws imaged discrete coarctation distal to the left subclavian '1rtery. DVSA was accomplished with injection of l cc/kg of 6Qt. Renovist into a peripheral vein, allowing imaging of Ll1e double aortic arch in all 3 patients and diagnosis of atresia of the left itrch between Lhe carotid and subclavian in 2. DVSA also confirmt->d thL' anatomy of the coarctations prior to surgery. For simple lesions, as in this study, 20 ecl10 and DVSA can provide complete presurgical diagnosis without cardiac cathcterization. Conventional diagnosis of left to right persistent ductus arteriosus (PDA) shunting relies on clinicaJ, radiographic, and echocardiographic findings. As these methods err to underdiagnosis, we studied the value of radionuclide angiography in 42 neonates clinically suspected of a PDA.",

In normal development, the relative mass of small pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PA-SMC) declines sharply after birth (Naeye, Arch. Pathol. 71:121, 1961) . In syndromes such as persistance of the fetal circulation this decline does not occur (Murphy, et al. J. Peds. 98:962, 1981) and PA-SMC proliferation seems to continue. Because heparin, or the heparin-like molecules secreted by endothelial cells, inhibits the induced growth of adult systemic vascular SMC in vivo and in vitro (Castellot, et al., J. Cell Biol. 90:372, 1981) , we have studied whether heparin also inhibits the proliferation of fetal PA-SMC. Primary cultures of calf aorta, and calf and fetal calf PA-SMC were arrested in G 0 by placing them in medium containing 0.2% calf serum. After 72 hrs, medium was changed to include 20% fetal calf serum with or without 30 \u00b5g/ml heparin. Cells were counted at 24-hr intervals. The growth of calf PA-SMC was inhibited to the same extent as reported for aortic SMC (Castellot, op cit).",

Single blastomeres of 4-, 8-, and 16-cell embryos (with zonae) were pressure injected with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The embryos were cultured to blastocysts, fixed, stained for peroxidase activity, serially sectioned, and the number and distribution of cells containing HRP determined. The presence of HRP did not inhibit cell divisions and although the distribution of HRP-labelled cells varied among embryos, labelled cells remained contiguous. The allocation of cells to the inner cell mass(ICM) or trophectodenn(TE) became evident at the 16-cell stage. Individual cells of the 4-cell embryos contributed progeny to the ICM and TE; approximately half of the blastomeres of the 8-cell embryos contributed progeny to both the ICM and TE while progeny from the other half produced only TE. Single \"outside\" cells of the 16-cell embryos occasionally contributed cells to the ICM while none of the \"inside\" cells at this stage procuced TE. Embryos treated with pronase or acid Tyrode's to remove the zonae resulted in the rapid spread of HRP among blastomeres. Our results demonstrate that HRP can be used effectively as a tracer for cell lineage studies in preimplantation mouse embryos; that cells of a common lineage remain contiguous during this period; and that the allocation of blastomeres to ICM or TE in intact whole embryos occurs progressively to the 16-cell stage at which time it is almost complete.

However, it may resort to endogenous glucose production (PR) if the transfer of gucose from placenta to fetus (TR) decreases. To test this hypothesis in chronically catheterized fetal lambs we measured simultaneously TR and the fetal glucose utilization rate (UR), and calculated PR (PR=UR-TR). UR was determined simultaneously by two different methods by comparing fetal glucose specific radioacitivty with net fetal tracer uptake from (I) a fetal intravenous infusion of 14c-U-glucose and (2) by a transplacental fetal infusion during a maternal IV infusion of 3H-6-glucose. The mean UR (mg\u00b7min-l\u00b7kg-1 .!. SEM) from the two infusions (3.39 + 0.27 fetal inf.; 3.04 + 0.32 maternal inf.) were similar, validating the tracer methods for calculating UR. TR was measured by the Fick principle. Both UR and TR were positively correlated with maternal plasma glucose (r=0.92 and 0.82, respectively) and UR with fetal plasma glucose (r=0.82). At TR < 3.0 mg\u00b7min-l\u00b7kg-1 corresponding to plasma (glucoselmaternal < 40.0 mg/di and plasma (glucoselfetal < 15.0 mg/di, UR was significantly greater than TR, documenting a mean endogenous glucose production of 1.22 .!. 0.27 mg\u2022min -I.kg-I.

Mouse teratocarcinoma cell cultures share many characteristics with the early mouse embryo and are a suitable model for studying aggregation and compaction during preimplantation development. H6 cells form uniform, grape-like clusters of adhering cells when rotated in medium (MEM) with 10% fetal calf serum. These aggregates are induced to compact within 1 hour when additional calcium (5mM) is supplied, resulting in a tight mass of cells with obscure cell boundaries and a smooth outer surface. Compaction can be reversed by removal of calcium and inhibited by cytoskeletal poisons and by the lectins concanavalin A and wheat germ agglutinin. This behavior is similar to compaction in the 8 cell morula. Mutants of H6 with altered aggregation or compaction will be useful for studying the molecular nature of these processes. We have isolated 3 aggregation-deficient variants which have lost the ability to form intercellular adhesions. Since cell surface glycoproteins are implicated in cell adhesiox, agglutination by eight lectins was tested. Only peanut agJlutL1in (PNA) had a significantly reduced effect on all 3 variants compared to parental cells. Measurement of fluoresceinated-PNA bound to the cell surface confirmed this deficiency; the mean fluorescence va 1 ue for parenta 1 cells was reduced to 1 /3 in the variant lines, suggesting that a galactose-rich glycoprotein is defective or missing in the variants and is associated with aggregation.

Conclusions: The increase in fetal B Q0 2 is dependent on increased volume and not on changes in transport dependent Q0 2 . In contrast, maturation of NE Q0 2 is independent of volume and dependent on chanqes in both sodium transport dependent and independent respiration. Basal {B), norepinephrine {NE) and dibutyryl cAMP (dBCAMP) stimulated oxygen consumption (Q0 2 ) were measured in isolated BAT cells from fetal sheep at 121-124 days gestational age (GA) {Group!, n=4), 136-140 days GA (Group II, n=5) and 2-4 days after birth (Group III, n=4). BAT cell volume also was determined. Mean (\u00b1SEM) B QO, (in \u00b5l 0 2 /10 6 cells-hr) increased from 10.5\u00b11.0 in Group I to 31.4\u00b12.1 in Group II and 38.5\u00b12.8 in Group 111. Cell volume increased from 9.0\u00b10.74 picoliters (pl) in Group I to 13.4\u00b12.0 pl in Group II and 18.4\u00b12.3 pl in Group III. B Q0 2 (adjusted for cell volume) for Group II was qreater than for Group I (p<0.005) and equal to Group III. Maximal NE (10-\u2022M) Q0 2 increased from 74.4\u00b116 in Group I to 294\u00b147 in Group II. Maximal NE Q0 2 in Group III (111\u00b127) was < Groun II and = Grouo I. dBCAMP stimulated Q0 2 increased from 51.3\u00b112 in r,roup I to 175\u00b122 in Group II and 172\u00b129 in Group III. Summary: 1) Basal BAT QD 2 (adjusted for chanqes in cell size) increases between 120 and 140 days GA but not after delivery. 2) Maximum NE Q0 2 occurs at 140 days GA and decreases after delivery. 3) Post-receptor stimulated BAT QO, (dBCAMP) increases between 120 and 140 days GA but does not decrease after delivery. Conclusions: l) Full maturation of BAT thermogenesis occurs prior to delivery near term in the ovine fetus. 2) In the neonatal lamb a decrease in BAT sensitivity to NE occurs at the receptor-adenyl cyclase level.

Its presence in mammalian blood has remained controversial due to the lack of adequate extraction and assay methods. Sep-Pak cartridges (ODS silica) were used to extract AVT from human blood and AVT was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) in the eluates. Mean (\u00b1SEM) recoveries of unlabeled AVT by RIA from pooled human plasma were 65\u00b11% with the addition of 5, 10, 50 or 100 pg/ml of peptide (N=5l). AVT and AVP levels were measured serially in umbilical arterial and venous plasma (N=l7) and in peripheral blood at 2 hr (N=9) and 24 hrs (N=9) of age. Mean (\u00b1SEM) plasma AVT levels were 5.2\u00b12.4 pg/ml, 5.5\u00b11. l pg/ml, 3.2\u00b11.9 pg/ml, and 3.9\u00b12.3 pg/ml, respectively.

The AVT antiserum shows approximately 5% cross reaction with either arginine vasopressin (AVP) or oxytocin (OT). However, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of cord blood demonstrated that the AVT immunoreactivity localized similarly to synthetic AVT; AVP and OT were well separated from the AVT peaks. Thus, we report l) an extraction method and RIA allowing measurement of pg quantities of AVT in human newborn plasma; 2) characterization of the AVT by HPLC; 3) significant levels of AVT in cord blood persisting through 24 hours; and 4) differing plasma levels of AVP and AVT in the first 24 hrs of life.

In addition, 43 venous or arterial samples were drawn from 18 infants (<:'.03-294 gestational days at birth) from 'l up to 24 days of age. They had no apnea or other overt respiratory control disturbances. Endorphins were measured in unextracted samples by radioimmunoassay (Human B-endorphin Kit, New England Nuclear Co., Boston, Ma.). Maternal plasma endorphin levels were elevated during pregnancy and were highest at labor and delivery. Endorpliins were elevated in umbilical and early neonatal blood and did not correlate with gestational age at birtn. The increased endorphin levels of the infants were sustained for tl1e first 4 days of postnatal life, beyond Vlhich they decreased to control (adult) levels. Because our previous work has demonstrated the suppressor effect of endorphin on respiratory control in adult and fetal subjects (Moss and Scarpelli, J. Appl. Physiol. 47:527, 197:1 and 5D:l011, 1981) , we propose that the elevated levels of endorphins in the early postnatal period may contribute to the subtle immaturity (suppression) of respiratory drive tl1at is known to exist during that time. Lung explants from 18 day fetal rats were maintained in serum-free organ culture for 48h with either 2 \u00b5g/ml prolactin (PRL) (NIH or Sigma)or 10-6 M Dexamethasone (DEX) or with a combination of DEX (first 24 h) followed by PRL (last 24 h). Lung DNA, protein, total phospholipid (PL) and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine ( male)in fetal pulmonary surfactant production in the rabbit is related to the hormonal regulation of fetal sexual differentiation. Manipulations of fetal sex hormones to induce sexual masculinization or feminization also masculinize or feminize the pattern of fetal pulmonary surfactant production. We tested the hypothesis that the sex difference in fetal pu l monary surfactant production is affected by the genetic determinants of sex by studying surfactant production in the chicken embryo. In avian species the sex karyotype is reversed from that of mammals (avian males are homogametes XX, females are heterogametes XZ). Leghorn eggs were incubated and the embryos sacrificed on days 15, 16,17,18, anG 19 of gestation (term= 21 days). The lungs were removed, weighed, and homogenized. Pulmonary surfactant was measured as saturated phosphatidylcholine (SPC) and expressed as \u00b5g SPC/100 mg wet lung weight (SPC ratio). On days 17 ,18, and 19 the SPC ratio was significantly higher in males than in females (day 17: male SPC ratio 76\u00b14; female SPC ratio 55\u00b12; mean \u00b1 SE; p<.DOl). Injection of estradiol (250\u00b5g) into the yolk sac at day 5 of gestation resulted in a lowering of the male SPC ratio and the sex difference was eliminated. This pattern of sex difference in fetal pulmonary surfactant fol lows the pattern of fetal sexual differentiation in birds and is reversed from that of mammals. We conclude that the sex difference in fetal pulmonary surfactant production is modulated by chromosomal as well as hormonal factors, and is linked with the process of fetal sexual differentiation. a.1-Adrene:cic aGonists increase myocardial inotropic response independently of B-adrenerGic mechanisms and is to primarily involve a.1J\\R present on sarcolemmal membranes in the heart.

To assess the effect of altered thyroid status on ovine fetal tlSS, thyroidectomy and insertion of a constant infusion pump was performed at 119-121 days gestation followed by 8 days of infusion with either T3 (4 animals, Group I 24 mcg/hr) or vehicle (4 animals, Group II). Fetuses were delivered by cesarian section and tissues were removed and extracted in perchloric acid for tissue catecholamine (CAT) levels or homogenized for beta adrenergic receptors (BAR Adrenergic mechanisms are important in the synthesis and release of pulmonary surfactant but the nature of these mechanisms is unclear. PNMT is the terminal enzyme in epinephrine (E) biosynthesis; its activity has been considered restricted to adrenal medulla. We have identified PNMT activity in the ovine fetal lung. A radiometric assay was used and results are expressed as pmole product formed mg protein-1 hr-1 X 10 3 \u2022 Km for purified fetal lung PNMT (9.91 X io-6 M) was similar to adrenal PNMT (4.17 X 10-\u2022M) as was the order of substrate specificity; phenylethanolamine > >> phenylethylamine. Similar elution profiles were noted during sephadex chromatographic purification but not cullulose ion-exchange chromatography. Polyacrylamide gel chromatography of the purified lung PNMT showed partial but not complete homology with the adrenal enzyme. Pharmacologic inhibitors of adrenal PNMT did not inhibit the purified lung enzyme. Lung PNMT was measured in 5-100 day (d), 4-120 d, and 4-140 d fetuses and in 7 newborn sheep at 3.6\u00b10.8 d. Activity increased from 132\u00b118 at 100 d to 326\u00b126 in NB. The correlation with advancing age (r;.570) was significant (p<.05). Conclusions: 1) PNMT is present in ovine fetal and newborn lung; 2) Chromatographic and pharmacologic properties of lung PNMT are different from the adrenal enzyme. Speculation: 1) Local production of E by lung PNMT may be important in regulation of surfactant metabolism. There was no change in the sensitivity of the various organisms to chloramphenicol at the end of the study period in the dark or in fluorescent light.",

Ward Rice, Jeffrey Whitsett, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics Surfactant release and smooth muscle tone in the lung are regulated by increases in intracellular c-AMP and shifts in intracellular calcium (Ca). Calmodulin (CDR) is known to regulate both c-AMP and Ca levels in certain cell types by interacting with c-AMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) and by stimulating Ca transport. Inhibition of c-AMP-PDE by treatment of the fetus with PDE inhibitors increases c-AMP and lung compliance and decreases the incidence of RDS in premature neonates. To understand the role of c-AMP and CDR in the regulation of pulmonary maturation and surfactant release, characteristics of c-AMP-PDE and CDR activity were determined in developing rat lung. Cytosolic PDE activity was 1.28\u00b10.24 nmoles c-AMP hydrolyzed/min/mg protein (\u00b1SEM, n;5) at 18 days gestation, before surfactant production begins. PDE activity decreased to 0.48\u00b10.09 at 20 days gestation, reached a nadir in the newborn animal of 0.17\u00b1 0.04 and increased to 0.41\u00b10.12 in the adult. At 18 days gestation c-AMP-PDE was inhibited by Ca-CDR, an effect not apparent in older animals. While lung PDE changed during development, CDR activity remained constant: 293\u00b142 ng of CDR actvity/mg protein (\u00b1SEM, n;6) at 18 days gestation, 262\u00b135 at 20 days, 229\u00b136 in the newborn, and 203\u00b128 in the adult. A significant (p<0.05} fall in PDE activity is associated with perinatal lung maturation. Although total CDR activity did not change with age, functional changes in Ca-CDR interactions with c-AMP-PDE were demonstrated during perinatal lung maturation.

The degree of structural divergence between the different species was determined by comparing the ratio of the antigenically cross-reacting material (as determined by sinele radial immunodiffusion) to the enzymatic SOD activity. This index of divergence was shown to be: human 1. Studies in our laboratory using the Swiss-Webster (SW) mouse have shown 1) the SMG NGF tissue concentrations have a logarithmic increase between 17-18 days of postnatal life, and 2) that this increase can be accelerated by injections of thyroxine for the first twelve days of postnatal life. These results verify a responsivity of NGF tissue concentrations to exogenous thyroid hormones but do not demonstrate dependency. Thus using a newly developed genetically conditioned congenitally hypothyroid mouse model (hyt/hyt), we are examining the use of NGF as a marker of thyroid hormone effect and the interrelationship of NGF and thyroid hormones on normal development. In preliminary studies, examination of both euthyroid (E) and hypothyroid (H) pups at 21 days of postnatal life reveals low tissue concentrations of NGF in the SMG (<.081 ng/mg tissue) relative to mean values (10 ng/mg) in SW mice. At 30 days H mice had low SMG NGF values (<.081 ng/mg) relative to E (l.89tl.59 ng/mg) or SW (200\u00b120 ng/mg) values. The early biological effect of thyroid hormones on SMG was reflected in a decrease in the SMG/body weight ratio in H (.64\u00b1X10-2 ) relative to E (.87!Xlo-2 ) mice. Conclusions: 1) The increase in SMG NGF tissue concentrations in SW is delayed in (E) controls of the hyt/hyt mutant; 2) This species difference is further obtunded in association with decreased SMG mass in the hyt/hyt mouse; 3) SMG NGF serves as a marker for hypothyroidism in this species. GCM acts as a protective barrier for the gastrointestinal tract_ Many of the pl\u2022ysiologic properties attributed to GCM are due to the complex carbohydrate coat. Recently, lectin studies have shown maturational differences in the rat intestinc1l cell surface components. To further investigate these differences small intestine GCM was isolated from NB (<24 hrs) and adult (Ad) rats using reported techniques. GCM purity was documented by carbohydrate and amino acid analysis. In SDS-agarose-acrylamide slab gel electrophoresis both mucins appear as a single broad band with the NB GCM moving ahead of the Ad GCM. After electrophoresis, lectin binding to GCM was done by incubating 125I-lecwith the gel. Gel slices were counted for radioactivity and the degree of each lectin bound was calculated hy integration of the total cpm bound to tl1e gels. In comparing the lectin binding to Ad and NB GCM (5\u00b5g of protein/gel), 3 different patterns were observed: 1) Dolichos biflorus bound only to Ad GCM and not to NB GCM, 2) Wheat germ agglutinin bound 6 times more avidly to NB GCM and 3) Ulex europeus I and Lotus tetragonolobus had the same degree of binding to both ml1 .. ..

Pneumonectomy and nephrectomy result in organ specific compensatory growth of the contralateral organ. Somatomedins may play a role in this.phenomenon (Am. Rev. Resp. Dis. 121,701,1980) . To explore whether serum Somatomedin C (Sm-C) levels are related to organ growth, left nephrectomy or sham chest surgeries were performed on 11, 11, and 10 rats respectively. Serum was collected on post-op days 3 and 5 and at sacrifice on day 7 and Sm-C levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. Sm-C appeared to fall in all groups durinq first 5 postop days, presumably due to the stress of surgery. From days 5 to 7, sham rats continued to show a fall in Srn-C levels; Sm-C levels were risinq significantly (p<0.05) in both pneumonectorny and nephrectomy rats (paired t-tPst). At no time did pneumonPctorny or nephrectomy rats have serum Sm-C levelg significantly elevated over shum rats. These findinqs sugqest that serum Sm-C does not reflect ongoing organ qrowth and that any influence on compensatory organ qrowth exerted by Sm-C probably occurs via a paracrine (i.e. local secretion, diffusion and action) rather than an endocrine mechanism. Lactate oxygen quotients have suggested the nutritional importance of lactate in the unstressed fetal lamb. The present study compared the net fetal LUU with the simultaneously measured fetal LUR. We studied fourteen late gestation sheep with catheters maintained chronically in the maternal artery and uterine vein, and the fetal artery and umbilical vein. Uterine and umbilical blood flows were measured using antipyrine, and net uterine and umbilical lactate uptakes were calculated by the Fick principle. Placental lactate production averaged 11.8 ! 0.7 mg/min (mean + SEM). Placental lactate distributed preferentially towards the fetus, with the net fetal LUU averaging 1.95 ! 0.16 mg/kg/min.

Consequently, the surface areas of exchange between mother and fetus in terms of capillary (9.94 \u00b1 1.01 vs 7.66 \u00b1 0.81 m2; p =NS) and villous (11.18 .\u00b1 1.36 vs 9.21 \u00b1 0.79 m2; p = NS) surface areas were only moderately enlarged in these placentas, due to a relatively lower number of villi filled with connective tissue (145 \u00b1 15 vs 84 \u00b1 5g; p < 0.01). On a functional basis, despite these morphological differences, these findings suggest that placental function is probably not adversely affected in class B diabetics. However, the placental changes described in the placentas of the LGA infants inay represent a less successful adaptation to the maternal disease, which may worsen in the more severe forms of diabetes during pregnancy. Maternal diabetes induces fetal hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia and it has been proposed that either or both of these conditions may produce the reduced synthesis of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPCl and phosphatidylglycerol (PGl observed in the fetal lung of diabetic rat pregnancies. We produced maternal diabetes in Sprague Dawley rats at 9 days gestation after a sing I e I . P. injection ( 60 mg/kg) of streptozoc in.

The effects of c-AMP on the cell are thought to be mediated by protein kinases {PK) activated when c-AMP binds to its regulatory subunit releasing the catalytic subunit. The catalytic subunit phosphorylates regulatory proteins within the cell altering their function. The present study describes the ontogenic changes of c-AMP-protein kinase activity, c-AMP binding proteins, and phosphoprotein substrates in the rat lung fran day 17 of gestation to adulthood. c-AMP dependent protein kinase was demonstrated at all ages studied. Phosphorylation activity was present in both cytoso l and merrbrane of the lung and was enhanced by c-AMP, c-GMP and Ca. c-AMP protein kinase activity in the presence of histone was 5.5\u00b1.87 nmole\u00b7mg-1 on day 18 of gestation and decreased postnatally to 2.75\u00b1.57 nmoles\u00b7mg-1, p<.01 in the adult.

In order to study the forces which regulate fluid flux, colloid osmotic pressure (COP), hematocrit (HCT), serum total solids (STS), mean blood pressure (MBP) and MBP-COP gradient (M-C) were measured in 184 women with normal uncomplicated pregnancy. COP fell gradually during the first and second trimesters, and reached its nadir at 30-34 weeks, thereafter it rose. These changes were p <.0001. The relationship of COP and gestational age (GA) was best described by the quadratic equation. The pattern of chanqes of HCT and STS during pregnancy were similar to COP. MBP and M-C were linearly correlated to GA. COP correlated directly with STS (r=0.71). Stepwise multiple regression analysis of COP on GA, STS, HCT, MBP and M-C showed that STS was the most significant variable, with GA, M-C and MBP followed in order. With the exclusion of HCT, the variables explained 100% of the variations of COP in normal pregnancy. In 90 pregnant women with diabetes mellitus, the COP and STS were lower, and M-C was higher than in women with normal pregnancy. COP in 9 women with toxemia of pregnancy was lower than both the above groups. The increase in M-C with advancing GA would promote fluid flux from the intra to extra vascular space in normal pregnancy and this process is further aggravated in pregnancy with diabetes mellitus and toxemia. The effect of HV on the MBF response to feeding was examined in term <2 Jay old (n=7) and 2-4 weeks old (n=lO) piglets. Phasic blood flow was measured using the experimental preparation previously described*. Temperature, EKG, and aortic pressure (AP) were monitored. Mesenteric vascular resistance (MVR) was calculated from mean AP and MBF. HV was induced by 15% reduction in estimated blood volume by blood withdrawal .,;a jugular and/or femoral catheter. MBF in the younger group showed a significant increase from control value 15-45 minutes after feeding (23.6 ml/ kg of sow's milk or commercial formula) which was not sustained through the 2 hour measurement period. MVR showed no significant change. In contrast, the older group, fed 26.5 ml/kg, showed a significant decrease in MVR. These findings differed from responses of normovolemic pigs of comparable ages where feeding under controlled conditions in the younger group showed a significant increase in MBF usually accompanied by a decrease in MVR, while the older group showed a significant postprandial MBF increase with an insignificant decrease in MVR. These results suggest an immaturity of the cardiovascular regulatory system in the younger pi9s with induced HV and feeding.

Hepatic tissue from 10 day postnatal rabbits and 3 month adult-male rabbits were used in the study. Initial studies demonstrated that hepatic cytosol from infant but not from adult rabbits significantly inhibited in vitrometabol ism of 1 mM biphenyl by adult hepatic microsomes. Addition of an NADPH generating system to the incubation medium containing cytosol had no significant effect on rates of drug metabolism. Based on cytosolic protein concentration, a final concentration of 6mg/ml of hepatic cytosolic protein from infant rabbits in the microsomes from adult rabbit significantly reduced the hydroxylation of biphenyl of 2-0H and 4-00 biphenyl by 50% and 24% respectively.

All three groups were similar in maternal age, gravidity and socioeconomic class and neonatal gestational age and Apgar scores. Significant differences in mean weight, length and head circumference at birth are detailed in the In follow-up there was evidence of long periods of annea which was documented by an abnormal pneumogram. Blood and urine levels on the infant at birth, 2 weeks and 1 month of age were negative for amphetamines. Due to the history of high levels of amphetamine exposure in utero, a1, a2 and 8 receptor sites were evaluated in the placenta and on the peripheral blood platelets at birth and 1 month of age. The resulta of these findings and their significance in terms of the withdrawal patterns and apnea of the newborn will be discussed. The effect of PD on serum concentrations (cone.) of Phenobarbital (Ph), Amikacin (Ak), Cefazolin (Cf) were studied in 2 pediatric patients. In patient 1 (5 days of age, 4.5 kg), intravenous (IV) Ph was administered (7.5-10 mg/kg/day) for seizure control. He received PD for management of hyperammonemia secondary to argininosuccinate deficiency. Ph clearance by PD was 6.36-8.22 ml/min/l.73m2. In patient 2 (16M, 7.5 kg), Ak (10 mg IV q 24\u00b0) and Cf (45 mg IV q 8\u00b0) were administered for presumptive sepsis post A-V canal repairment and cardiac pacemaker implantation. PD was instituted because of progressive renal function deterioration of renal function post-operatively. PD clearance of Ak and Cf were 2.34-3.72 ml/min/l .73m2 and 1.72-4.44 ml/min/l.73m2 respectively. Serum concentrations (cone.) of all three drugs decreased substantially during PD. Additional amount of Ph was required to maintain therapeutic serum cone. to assure seizure control. PD clearance of Cf was found to correlate with cardiovascular function integrity. OJr experiences demonstrated that substantial amount of the drugs can be removed during PD to result in sub-therapeutic serum cone. Serum drug cone. should therefore be obtained to determine the amount of drug necessary to maintain adequate therapy.

GENTAMICIN Gentamicin pharmacokinetics in the neonate has been described by a two compartment open model in recent literature. Proper characterization of the beta phase of this model is clinically infeasible on an individual basis. We chose to characterize the pharmacokinetics of our patients using a one compartment open model on the first dose to individualize gentamicin (G) therapy in sixty neonates (term and preterm). A dose of 2.5mg/kg was given intravenously over 20 minutes and serum gentamicin concentrations (SGCs) were determined at 1, 7 and 11 hours post infusion. Linear regression analysis on these SGCs was used to determine half-life and volume of distribution. From this data a new regimen and a predicted peak (P) and trough (T) SGC was determined for each neonate. The predicted P and T were compared to a measured P or T drawn at least 4R hours later. Criteria for successful dosing was based on attaining peaks of 4-Smcg/ml and troughs of < 2mcg/ml. Both formulas decreased the incidence of C induced toxicity. The mechanism of this protection and the possibility that the amount of protection is formula specific are under investigation. ",

Mean elimination half-life, plasma clearance and volume of distribution for T were 45 hrs (range 26-70); 60 ml/(hr x kg) (range 43-74); and 3.7 L/kg (range 2.4 to 5.9), respectively. The variation was probably secondary to variability in the volume of distribution. No adverse effects were noted other than a drop in mean arterial blood pressure of 7 nmHg (range 4-11). We conclude from these preliminary data that it is feasible to give T at these infusion rates and that its pharmacokinetic properties are significantly different from those of the adult.

All strategies were similar in accuracy: STC's were slightly higher than those predicted by each of the three strategies, presumably reflecting the well described deep compartment accumulation of aminoglycosides. However, the precision of methods I and II was not better than III and they actually tended to be less precise (See Table) . RATIO Ethanol is a teratogen in experimental animals and humans and the effects are variable but correlate best with maternal blood ethanol concentration(BEC). The purpose of this study was to measure BEC in mother, fetus and newborn monkeys to define the pharmacokinetics at different gestational ages and doses. Rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys from 106-156 days gestation were prepared with indwelling catheters in both maternal and fetal arteries. Dilute ethanol was infused in a maternal vein for 30 min. at doses of l.5,1.0 or 0.8 g/kg. Simultaneous blood samples were drawn from mother and fetus and for 4-6 hours after the infusion. Three neonates were sampled for 120 min. after delivery to obtain elimination kinetics. Maternal and fetal BE elimination rates(ER) were nearly identical during the four hours following infusion. Maternal and fetal BEC correlated highly (r=0.98) during the elimination phase. After delivery of the fetus, the maternal ER of 14.9\u00b11.6 mg%/hr was 4 times that of the neonatal ER (3.6\u00b10.2 mg%/hr). We conclude that the maternal BEC in monkeys is highly predictive of the fetal BEC. The capacity of the neonate to eliminate ethanol is limited, probably due to a low level of alcohol dehydrogenase in the newborn. Therefore, fetal exposure to this teratogenic agent is determined primarily by maternal elimination capacity. The simultaneous clearances of amikacin (ACl) and inulin (!Cl) were studied in 9 hospitalized children with normal renal function aged 5-18 yrs. The children were hydrated for 5-6 hrs prior to study with 100cc/M2/hr of Nl saline. During the study the rate was increased to 125cc/M2/hr. ACl was calculated as D/AUC from 10 serum levels of amikacin obtained throughout 4 hours time. The AUC was estimated beyond 4 hours. Urine flow rates were calulated from spontaneously voided timed urine specimens obtained during the same period. A linear relationship was demonstrated between ACl and urine flow as ml/min/M2 (p<.001; r=.81) !Cl was obtained using a loading dose followed by a constant infusion of inulin. !Cl calculated as D/AUC had a linear relationship to urine flow (p<.001; r=.79). Both !Cl and ACl calculated using UV/P correlated well with the results obtained using D/AUC indicating urine loss was not a problem. Two children not receiving amikacin were hydrated for lY,-3 hrs with Nl saline at a rate of 62cc/M2/hr and had fractional sodium excretion rate FENa and !Cl measured. The IV rate was then increased to 125cc/M2/hr for hrs and the studies repeated. In one child the GFR (D/AUC) changed from 92 ml/min to 136 ml/min while the FENa changed from 0.36% to 1.11%. In the other the GFR changed from 132 ml/min to 207 ml/min while the FENa was 1.3% and 1.15% respectively. These data suggest a responsiveness of GFR and drug clearance to alterations in the hydration rate in children who have a normal sodium ba 1 ance. The aim of this study was to develop a noninvasive, safe, sensitive clinical test capable of detecting xenobiotic-induced alteration of the cytochrome P1450-<lependent mixed function oxidase system in the adult and pediatric patient. Cigarette smoking, known to induce both cytochrome P1450 system and caffeine (Caf) clearance, was the experimental variable. Labeled Caf with 13c or 14c in the (1,3,7) methyl groups (TRl-Caf) or specifically labeled at the 1-, 3-, or 7-methyl group were studied as substrates for the CBT. TRI-Caf, 1, 3, or 5 mg/kg was orally administered to 5 smokers and 4 nonsmokers and the exhaled labeled co 2 was monitored for 8 or 24 hr. The absolute rate of labeled C02 exhaled was dose-dependent at 1 and 3 mg/kg but demonstrated saturation kinetics at 5 mg/kg. The rate of labeled C02 excretion averaged 2-fold greater in the smokers. The 2-hr cumulative labeled C02 excretion correlated highly with the apparent oral metabolic clearance rate of Caf (r=0.90) during the 3 mg/kg dose study. To determine the contribution of labeled C02 in the breath from demethylation of the 1,3, or 7 methyl groups, Caf specifically labeled at the 1,3, or 7 position was administered on 3 separate days to a smoker and a nonsmoker. The majority (95 and 79%, respectively) of the labeled C02 exhaled in the first 2 hr of the TRI-Caf CBT was derived from the 3 position while at 6-8 hrs equal amounts were derived from the 3 and 7 positions. The optimal substrate for the CBT was (13c-3 methyl) Caf, at a dose of 3 mg/kg. The 2-hr cumulative excretion of labeled C02 was the most sensitive CBT measure of Caf N-<lemethylation induction. The aim of this study was to determine if megadoses of E administered to the 02-<lependent premature could raise the total plasma tocopherol to pharmacologic levels above the normal adult range (1.1 mg/di \u00b1 0.5). All subjects were <1500 gm, AGA, <48 hr old and required an for at least the first 24 hr of life. E, dl-41E-tocopherol acetate in a dose of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day was administered for 7 days via nasogastric tube. Seven infants who continued to be 02-<lependent after 7 days were continued on E at 100 or 200 mg/kg/day until weaned to room air at a mean age \u00b1 1 SD of 26\u00b1 16 days. Total plasma tocopherol was determined just prior to the next dose of E at 24, 48, 168 hr, and at weekly intervals (Table) . For each dosage group, the mean gestational age, birth weight, Apgar score, and Fi02 were similar.",

The abstinence scoring system (Ped. Res.58:1978) is an adjunct in the assessment and treatment of infants undergoing abstinence and is comprised of 21 symptoms in varying degrees of severity including central nervous,metabolic,vasomotor,respiratory,and gastrointestinal disturbances. A factor analysis was performed on a sample of 100 random scores to determine which symptoms are primary indicators in order to simplify the scoring system and increase efficiency of care. The individual symptoms were then ranked according to their respective weights. The 7 variables with highest weights (LF>.02) were: tremors (disturbed), increased muscle tone,fever,excoriation,nasal stuffiness,high pitched cry, and hyperactive Moro reflex. Using these symptoms,and their degrees of severity,as a revised system,125 random matched scores were obtained and a comparison made. Correlation between the two systems was r=.85(p<.0001). A regression was calculated to establish a critical point on the revised system with the results that a 5 on the new system corresponds to an 8 on the current one (an 8 being the point at which treatment is iflitiated). The matched piirs of scores were then divided according to these critical points with the result that 112 pairs corresponded exactly for treatment/nontreatment status. Of the 13 scores which did not \"match\",8 infants would have been treated earlier on the revised system than on the current one, while 4 had local peaks and therefore would not have been treated on either system. This abbreviated scoring system, consisting of 7 pertinent symptoms of neonatal abstinence, may be a more efficient tool in the management of these infants. Aminoglycoside antibiotics potentiate muscle weakness in patients with presynaptic (botulism) or post synaptic (myasthenia, competitive blockade) neuromuscular transmission defects. Because two patients whose clinical course of muscle weakness due to hypermagnesernia worsened after aminoglycosides, and the similarity of action of Mg++ ion to botulinal toxin on the neuromuscular junction, we investigated the ability of tob and amk to potentiate MgS04 induced lethality in Swiss-Webster mice. Six week old male mice were given MgS04 in saline, or MgS04 was given after tob or amk so that peak levels of each drug (aminoglycosides and MgS04) would coincide. MgS04 alone produced death in 4 of 30 mice (13%). MgS0 4 plus three concentrations of tab (90 mice in each group) resulted in a significantly (p< 0.001) greater number of deaths when compared to matched groups given MgS04 alone (MgS04 + tab 25 mg/kg -63% deaths, Mgso 4 + tab 50 mg/kg -57% deaths, MgS04 + tob 100 mg/kg -70%",

Althouqh decreased estrogen in anencephaly could influence response to smoking, nonresponse was not limited to this defect and the findinqs may indicate increased risk for malformation in association with lack of response to PAH exposure. This study was designed to test whether the Theophylline (Th) induced decrease in cerebral bloodflow demonstrated in adult humans and animals affects cerebral tissue pH (CtpH). The effect of Th on cerebral tissue-arterial H+ concentration gradient (l'lH+) was studied in 3 anesthetized newborn piglets (I) during hyperventilation (HV) (2) after a JO mg/kg i.v. injection of Th and (3) during HV after Th therapy. CtpH was continuously measured with a tissue pH electrode (Roche Bioelectronics) implanted in the cererbral cortex. Arterial blood pH was measured intermittently. Baseline CtpH was lower than arterial blood pH (7.07-7.18* vs 7.39-7.42*). After liV, there was a slight decrease in l' l H+ (-I 0%, -17%, -20% respectively). Th did not affect baseline II H+. However, in Th pretreated animals, HV was associated with a dramatic increase in l'lH+ (+ 48%, + 77%, + 126% respectively). Indeed, after Th, HV resulted in a transient increase in C.tpH followed by a decrease from pre HV values (6.98-7.24*) to (6.96-7.lu*), although blood pH remained in the range of 7.6 to 7.8. This phenomenon was never observed during HV before Th. It is suggested that the decrease of cerebral blood flow induced by HV in Th pretreated animals results in an impaired tissue oxygen supply and in subsequent tissue acidosis. It is concluded that Th induces cerebral acidosis during HV. *RANGE. PB dissociation and distribution are related to pH, and tissue release is observed with alkalosis.",

Patients received a single dose of moxalactam, 50 mg/kg intravenously over 20 min. Blood samples were obtained just prior to the infusion and at 0.5,1,2,4,6 and 8 hr after stopping the infusion.

Although an incomplete hydrolysis of CS to C has been shown, little is known about the change in CS kinetics during hospitalization.

Doses of CS were, 19.7-26 mg/kg q 6 hr and 19-25.4 mg/kg q 6 hr IV over 0.5-1.0 hr, resnectively. Blood samples were obtained at 0,0.5,1,2,4 and 6 hr after starting infusion and analyzed by HPLC. Peak serum concentration ranges of CS after first and second studies were 22.9-181.6 and 18.7-57.9 \u00b5g/ml, while that of C were 16.9-46.3 and 12.5-37.6 \u00b5g/ml, respectively. Trough serum concentration rahges of C also decreased with time from 1.77-27.0 to 0.88-6.10 \u00b5g/ml. Total body clearance of CS after the first study, 9.32 \u00b1 3.64 increased to 19.36 \u00b1 7.32 ml/ kg/min after the second study (p < 0.005). Apparent volume of distribution and elimination half-life of CS did not change considerably with time. An increase in CS clearance and decrease in C concentration may be due to an autoinduction of CS and C metabolism and/or increased renal elimination of unhydrolyzed CS with time. Serum concentration of C should be monitored frequently to detect changes in its formation from CS, particularly in children receiving CS for longer than 5 days. ",

This study was sponsored by the White Cross Guild, MMSFI and CHRF. Although many infants with bronchiolitis receive theophylline (T), little is known about T pharmacokinetics in this age group. We studied T kinetics in 12 patients (age 3 weeks-6.5 mo) with normal liver, renal and cardiac function. Nine of the 12 patients received a single dose of aminophylline (5.0-8.5 mg/kg) whereas the remainder were at steady-state receiving multiple doses (2.5-5.0 mg/kg) of aminophylline. The dose was administered IV over 0.5-1.0 hr. Blood samples were obtained at 0,0.5,l,2, 4 and 6 hr after the start of drug infusion. In 6 patients, urine output was collected over the same dosing interval. Peak serum concentrations of T measured by HPLC ranged from 8.48-21.6 \u00b5g/ml. Total, renal and nonren;l clea2ance of T ranged from 4.66-19.3, 1.07-5.76 and 3.59-16.8 ml/min/m, respectively; renal clearance accounted for 15-50% of total clearance. Apparent volume of and elimination half-life of T varied from 7.04-12.0 L/m and 5.77-29.0 hr. Although no significant correlation was observed between age and theophylline kinetic pararreters, clearance appeared to increase and half-life tended to decrease with age. Our patients had a substantially lower clearance and longer half-life as compared to published data in children > l yr of age. A five-fold variation in T clearance demonstrates the need for monitoring T serum concentration to individualize therapy.

A physical evaluation and of clinical course, a neurological assessment, and behavioral evaluation including the Merrill-Palmer Scale of Mental Tests(MP), were performed on all subjects. There was no significant difference between groups on height, weight or rate of infections. However, there were significantly more head circumferences(HC) below the 3%ile in M vs. C (p<.01).

Patients heterozygous for GSH synthetase deficiency(GSH-SH) are phenotypically normal in the absence of drug-induced stress, and have normal baseline intracellular GSH content. We have studied the response of GSH-SH lymphocytes to APAP metabolites generated by a murine hepatic microsomal system. Cells were incubated with microsomes and APAP for 2 hrs, collected by centrifugation, suspend ed in drug and microsome-free medium for 16 hrs, and toxicity assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion. GSH-SH cells had normal baseline viability. However, the cells showed significant damage at low APAP concentrations which were non-toxic for normal cells, and had an increased percent of dead cells at high concentrations (normal:l8.3+0.5% dead cells at 1.5mg/ml APAP; patients:29.9+0.5% and 29.7+1.5%). N-Acetylcysteine added to the medium after the 2 hr drug challenge decreased toxicitv in normal cells(3.9\u00b10.5%), but did not alter GSH-SH cell toxicity. GSH-SH cell GSH content not recover as much as in normal cells when incubated with N-acetylcysteine after APAP exposure. N-Acetylcysteine may protect cells in part by providing cysteine for synthesis of GSH which, in turn, may be involved in repair processes after APAP-induced damage. GSH-SH patients(prevalence approx. 10-4) may be at increased risk for APAP toxicity, and may not be protected by N-acetylcysteine because of decreased ability to regenerateGSH after APAP challenge secondary to normal enzyme activity.",

The half-life and clearance rate was 2.2 hours and 500 ml/Kg/hr respectively after oral administration. Maximum serum levels observed were 5.0ug/ml (IV) and 4.2 ug/mL (PO) at 30 minutes, and minimum levels of 0.3ug/ml (IV)and 0.6ug/mL (PO) at 8 hours. A serum level of 0.5ug/mL is necessary to achieve 80% suppression of acid secretion. The higher level attained after oral adm1nistration may be due to delayed absorption of cimetidine. Our preliminary results indicate that the elimination of cimetidine in infants is similar to that in adults. Oral and intravenous administration appears to result in equivalent elimination patterns. Current dosing guidelines suggesting the administration of 5-10 mg/kg of c1metidine every twelve hours may not be applicable to infants. Our data implies that a lower dose and decreased dosing interval may be necessary in order to avoid potential adverse CNS, renal, and hepatic reactiu.1s. The use of intravenous (IV) morphine in combination with muscle relaxants, nitrous oxide and oxygen in balanced anaesthesia is of growing importance in children, but optimal dosage and rate of morphine administration is controversial due to limited available pharmacokinetic information. We have studied 12 children from birth to 5 yr of age receiving IV morphine as part of balanced anaesthesia regimens at varied dosages including bolus injections of 11 and 50 \u00b5g/kg and maintenance infusions of 1 and 2 \u00b5g/kg/min. In order to determine morphine serum concentrations we developed a sensitive and specific assay by reverse phase paired-ion high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Only 100 \u00b5l scrum or plasma is required for analysis permitting quantitation at multiple points. Total body clearance (TBC) of morphine was 21.1 \u00b1 2.4 ml/kg/min (X \u00b1 SD, n= 11), a value significantly greater than the TBC of 6.2 ml/kg/min reported by et al. (Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 26:354-365, 1979 ) for children aged 1-7 yr after a single dose. From our data it appears that a loading dose of 50 \u00b5g/kg over 5 min followed by a maintenance infusion of 2 will provide a steady state serum morphine concentration between 80 and 100 i1g/L. The minimum serum concentration for analgesia during surgery in children approximates 65 \u00b5g/L according to Dahlstrom (see above). Calculation of parenteral morphine dosage for children must take into account a TBC three times greater than previously realized if subanalgesic serum concentrations arc to be avoided.

Right to left cardiovascular shunts in PFC prevent accurate measurement of vascular resistances in newborns.",

Cardiovascular resistances and heart rate were determined 3-5 times at each concentration, averaged and compared to control. The relationship between cardiovascular parameters and log [TZ] from 0.30 to 11.71 mcg/ml (N=24) were analyzed. Increasing [TZ] produced a concentration-related increase in cardiac index (p<0.05), decrease in svn (p<0.01, slope= -15.8), and decrease in PVR (p<0.001, slope= -28.2). Thus, increasing [TZ] decreases PVR twice as rapidly as SVR. VITAMIN Rabbit pups delivered via Caesarian-section at 31 days gestation (tenn) were housed in temperature, humidity and bacterially controlled chambers and exposed to 95+% oxygen or air for 48 hours. 100 mg/kg vitamin E or placebo was administered S.Q. at 1 and 24 hours of life. On sacrifice, the pups' tracheas were cannulated for pressure-volume determinations and lavage collection, or for glutaraldehyde fixation and morphanetric analysis. Oxygen exposure resulted in 25% less total lavage phospholipid content, smaller relative concentration of lavage phosphatidylglycerol (2.3 vs 3.6% total phospholipid), smaller maxi.mum lung volumes and a higher pressure to inf late the lungs to 30% maximum volume (19.2 vs 15.5 an H 2 0). Additionally, reduced air: tissue ratios were detennined f ran lung sections in oxygenexposed pups as canpared to air-treated littermates. Treatment with vitamin E was shown to canpletely abolish all these effects of hyperoxia, with values for oxygen-exposed +vitamin E-treated pups unchanged fran those for air-exposed controls. Vitamin E treated air-exposed animals were found to be the same as placebotreated, air-exposed littermates. These data indicate that hyperoxia exposure in the newb:>rn rabbit affects the lun:i b:iochanically, functionally, and morphologically. Vitamin E treatment restores these changes to control values without exerting any additional effect of its own in the control, air-exposed situation. Thus, vitamin E treatment rray act as a protectant in the lung challenge:l with hyperoxia, possibly through its action as an antioxidant.

Nine indications (see Table) were assigned to 6616 drug regi.Jrens given for the first tirre to 495 neonates in an intensive care unit in 1977-78. 135 dzugs were used and indications were based on arbitrarily set criteria:l)evidencc for definite existence of disease process, based on laboratory and clinical criteria, 2)evidence for efficacy and appropriateness of a drug for the disease process based on available pharmacologic data.Results sho.-1 a good roncordance of the initial and the final degree of indication except for the non-inidcated drugs and those given on a presUI1ptive basis. INDICATIOO Hypothalamic pituitary function in the primary empty se!la syndrome (ESS) has been studied extensively in the adult population, but few pediatric patients have been evaluated. We report on the pituitary function in 5 female children-I black, 4 white-with ESS having a mean age at the time of diagnosis of 8 8/12 yrs. and a range of 2 9/12 -12 8/12 yrs. The diagnosis of empty sella was established by CT scan with and without metrizamide cisternography. Pituitary TSH, ACTH, GH and prolactin reserve were assessed in response to provocative stimulation. Oxytocin (OT) is essential for milk removal in most animals but in sheep and goats normal milk yields have been obtained during hand milking without measurable release of oxytocin using bioassay techniques. To examine the influence of nonnal suckling on plasma OT, we have measured plasma OT by RIA in 4 sheep on days 1 to 15 of lactation. Each ewe nursed one lamb 2 to 3 times daily. Samples were taken through an indwelling catheter before the lamb was brought near the ewe, and before contact was allowed with the lamb, at active suckling, and at l, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 min aftE'r suckling began. Basal OT was 10+4.5 pg/ml, rising significantly to 21.8+5.7 pg/ml after the lamb was returned but before tactile contact was established. A further rise occurred in all instances during suckling, maximum levels varying from 14 to 210 pg/ml. Mean plasma OT was raised over basal levels throughout the suckling periods which lasted 2.9+0.38 min on average. After suckling stopped, OT levels remained elevated in most instances for considerable lengths of time, returning to baseline in about 60 min. Thus, during each suckling episode, the lamb induced secretion of oxytocin in the ewe. Moreover, the reflex becomes conditioned very rapidly as indicated b:; the rise in maternal p 1 as ma OT at the sight of the 1 amb from day 2 onwards.",

We determined thf' rates of cholesterol formed de nova in short term in vitro incubations of various fetal tissues;-ootalned from human -aoortuses at gestational acies from 8-22 weeks by measuring the rate of incorporation of tritium from [ 3H !water into cholesterol.

In testicular tissue, peak rates of cholesterol synthesis were noted at 14 weeks qestation, ;mci declining values therp;ifter.

We have now investigated the effects of LHRHa treatment on ulnar growth in patients with this condition. Ulnar growth is a sensitive index of short term growth in children and correlates well with linear growth. Seven girls and one boy (ages 4 to 8 years), with Tanner II-IV development, advanced bone age, and pubertal levels of gonadotropins and gonadal sex steroids, were studied. Three week ulnar growth rates (TIJG) were measured 2 months before, and for several months after institution of treatment with 4 of LHRH \u2022\u2022 TIJG Basal 1-2 mo 3-4 mo 5-6 mo 7-8 mo 9-10 mo (mm/3wk) ( p<o.o5-Mean TIJG decreased during LHRHa therapy, with the mean TIJG after 5 months of therapy being significantly less than before therapy (p<0.05). The ratio between bone age and chronologic age advancement remained at or below 1 during treatment with LHRHa. We conclude that LHRHa produced a significant decrease in ulnar growth rate suggesting that it may be effective in reducing the accelerated growth of children with precocious puberty. The biochemical effects of administering insulin once a day were compared to bi-daily injections in 19 diabetics. M-value, scrum Hb A1c.T4, free T4,T3, cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, and a TRH stimulation test were obtained on once a day insulin therapy and 3 months later on bi-daily; 14 non1al adolescents had the same tests. There was a significant improvement in M-value, (mean\u00b1 SE) from 108.4\u00b120.0 to 37.5\u00b14.2, p<0.01 and Hb A1c 12.1%\u00b1 0.6 to 9.2%\u00b10.6, p<0.01. Serum T4, free T4 and HDL concentrations in diabetics in both therapies were not different from normal adolescent controls. Serum T3 and T3/T4 ratio in insulin once a day were lower than normals (T3=115\u00b110.8 for diabetics and 18218.9 for controls ratio=0.004\u00b10.001 for diabetics and 0.029\u00b10.002 for controls, p<0.003), and returned to the normal range of controls after 3 months of bi-daily injections. TRH Adolescent diabetics are difficult to control with insulin injections due to the physiological changes associated with sexual maturation. \\.Je compared the effects of insulin once a day to bidaily insulin in 19 adolescent diabetics, by admitting them to the Hospital on once a day insulin and re-evaluating them three months later on bi-daily injections; 23 normal adolescents were studied as controls. Maximum insulin dose tolerated without hypoglycemia was 0.9\u00b10.1 unit/Kg/day on once a day and 1.5\u00b10.1 on bi-daily. Systolic blood pressure and resting pulse rates we-roe elevated as compared to controls(B.P. 121.5\u00b12.5 and 105.1\u00b11.6 p<0.03 and P.R.: 78.6\u00b13.6 and 70.9\u00b12.9, p<0.05) and decreased to normal after three months of bi-daily insulin. Eight of 10 diabetic females had amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea on one injection a day but the menses became regular after 3 months of bi-daily injections. Two quantitative indexes of diabetic control M-value and serum Hb Aic significantly improved on bi-daily injections. M-value decreased from 108.4\u00b120 in 1 injection to 37.5\u00b14.2 on bidai ly, p<0.01 and Hb A1c from 12. 1%\u00b10.6 to 9.2%\u00b10.6, p<0.01. These results suggest that insulin administered bi-daily to adolescent diabetics normalizes B.P., P.R., menses and improves biochemical parameters of diabetic control. The most serious problem with bi-daily injections was compliance; three patients withdrew from using bi-daily injections on the 1st month and 4 found to have elevated serum Hb Ale did not comply with bi-daily injections.

Binding of 125I-hGH to \"somatogenic\" sites in crude membrane-rich homogenates from livers of Tx and GH-treated Tx rats was nearly twice that in euthyroid rats, and was due to increased binding Conclusion: Hypothyroidism is associated with low circulating Sm-C which is not due to an obvious decrease in CH secretion or responsiveness. It is possible that the growth failure of hypothyroidism is related to the lowered Sm-C. The possibility that C,often used in neonatal apnea, nay produce acute or chronic changes in thyroxine(T4J, thyrotropin (TSH) and growth horrrone(GH} was studied in the NR. Five day old rats were randomly ilivided into 3 groups(n=50/grp}. Control group received saline; lc:w-dose caffeine(UX:) group, received 5 mg/kg IP and high-dose caffeine(HOC} group, received 50 mg/kg IP. In each group, rats were sacrificed 2,4 or 24 h after a single injection (acute effects) or 24 h after 10 days of daily injection (chronic effects]. Gl, T4 and TSH were rreasured by RIA, C by HPLC. After acute C, Gl significantly increased 2h after HOC (rrean \u00b1SEM} (75.4 \u00b115.5 vs 27.7\u00b16.3 ng/ml,p<.05); 24h after UX: (97.1\u00b111.3 vs 40.9\u00b1 7.0, p<.05) and HOC (169.8\u00b136.2 vs 40.9\u00b17.0 ng/ml, p<.001). After chronic C the increase in Gl was small suggesting depletion of pituitary reserve. After acute HOC, T4 response was bi.phasic with an increase at 4h (3.8\u00b10.l vs 3.3\u00b10.2 \u00b5g/dl, p<.05) and decrease at 24h (4.1\u00b10.2 vs 4.8\u00b10.2 \u00b5g/dl, p<.001). Thyrotropin-releasing honrone (TRH}-stimulated TSH at 24h was not influenced by C. Chronic C increased T4 and TSH, but decreased TRH stimulated TSH, suggesting bl1.mted TSH response after chronic C. C D:>se (mg/kg/dxl.Od) 0 (CONTROL) 5 (ILC} 50 (HOC} T4 (\u00b5g/dl} 4.1\u00b1 0.3 5.1\u00b1 0.3(p<.001) 6.0\u00b1 0.2(p<.001) TSH (\u00b5g/dl) 10.6\u00b1 1.4 17.9\u00b1 2.6(p<.05) 25.1\u00b1 6.9(p<.05) TRH-induced TSH 216.8\u00b145.5 101.9\u00b119.5(p<.05) 153.6\u00b131.7(p<.05) We conclude that doses of C currently used for neonatal apnea may produce acute and chronic changes in horrronal status in the NR. Horrronal effects of C in ne\\ooborn infants require further studies. Case had no mass on MC, but high levels of LHRH by RIA in his CSF ( l40pg/ml; controls-undetectable), implicating a suprasellar mechanism in the etiology of his precocity. Case 4 had an eroded sella and presumed prolactinoma (ame11orrhea, galactorrhea, hyperprolactinemia). After 1 yr therapy with bromocriptinc, transsphenoidal exploration revealed ESS confirmed by AEG, suggesting that tumor regression may predispose to arachnoid herniation. We conclude that in children (a) the spectrum of ESS is heterogeneous with both primary and secondary causes, and (b) endocrine abnormalities may be more common than in adults with the syndrome. The role of elevated CSF hormone levels in patients with abnormal CSF circulation warrants further investigation. ",

With their informed consent, 7 women with uncomplicated (39 to 41 wks) pregnancies were followed during spontaneous labor. During the last stage of vaginal delivery 100 ucg of LHRH was administered intravenously to the mother. Approximately 10 minutes after delivery, blood was obtained from the cord and at 15,30,45,60,90 and 120 minutes from an umbilical catheter in the neonate. Concentrations of BLH were determined in the serum by means of the in vitro RICT assay utilizing 2nd IRP-hMG as the standard. Of the 7 neonates 4 were niale and 3 female. All had normal birth weights and Apgar scores. The BLH concentrations in the cord blood of boys and girls were 165\u00b1 112 and 158\u00b117 mIU/ml (mean\u00b1lSD). These values were not significantly different from values in the cord blood of 7 neonatal boys and 7 girls whose mother did not receive LHRH. In boys and girls of LHRH injected mothers the maximum BLH was achieved between 30 and 45 minutes. The increase in boys varied from 168 to 1586%, whereas in the girls it was lower 1 hetwcen 125 and 336%. It is therefore concluded that: 1) LHRH administered to the mother during the last of labor does not significantly alter BLH co!1centrations In cord blood but may contribute to postnatal BLH elevations and 2) the rise in newborn boys exceeds that of girls. The of this study were to a) determine the concentrations of b1oactive (B)Lll in the blood of both boys and girls during the first 7 days of life and b) evaluate the pattern of B-LH secretion on day 7. Blood was obtained daily for the first 7 days of life in 7 full-term neonatal boys and 4 girls. The BLH was determined in the serum by means of the in vitro RICT assay utilizing 2nd IRP-hMG as the standard mIU/ml To determine the pattern of BLH secretion on day 7, 4 girls and boys had blood withdrawn Q 20 min for a period of 2 h. The % CV in 4/5 boys (17.9,14.0,52.4,15 .2) and 3/4 girls (24. 4,17.3,19. 2) was at least 3 times greater than that of the assay (<5)suggesting the possibility of pulsatile secretion. These data demonstrate that a) BLH reaches a nadir on day 4 after birth in both boys and girls most probably corresponding to the disappearance of endogenous hCG activity; b) in boys BLH rises significantly by postnatal day 7, most probably the result of endogenous LH secretion; c) in girls BLH continues to decline and by postnatal day 7 is significantly lower than on day 4 and d) both boys and girls exhibit pulsatile secretion of BLH on postnatal day 7.",

Conventional growth hormone (CH) replacement often fails to induce growth rates that can restore stature to the normal range even in doses exceeding current recommendations. While dosage increments may alter the peak GH value, plasma GH levels are elevated for only hrs after intramuscular injection. Recently we showed that CSIGH could maintain sustained elevations in CH for 4 days. Because the natural secretory pattern of GH is pulsatile, the effectiveness of CSIGH in the stimulation of growth remained to be determined. 4 GHD boys (10.1\u00b11.2 yrs) who had stable growth rates on conventional CH Rx (.3U/kg/wk in 3 doses) received CSIGH for 4 months in a dose which raised plasma CH to 9-11 ng/ml (.6-.9 U/kg/wk).

Serum estradiol levels ranged from 189 to 1285 pg/ml, progesterone was 82 ng/ml and dehydroepiandosterone-S04 21 \u00b5g/dl. Multiple ovarian cysts up to 5 cm in diameter were present bilaterally on pelvic ultrasound. The normal T4 and T3 levels, normal TSH response to thyrotropin releasing hormone, as well as normal parathyroid hormone level, and normal cortisol response to ACTH stimulation and dexamethasone suppression ruled out hyperfunction of other endocrine glands.

In our patient, the occurrence of sexual precocity, in the absence of elevated gonadotropins (Gn) and a prepubertal Gn ie\u00a3:.)onse to LRH suggests an autonomous hyperfunction of the ovaries not mediated through the hypothalamic-pituitary gonadal axis. We have studied the rate and character with which T-R and DHT-R complexes dissociate within, and after extraction from ['H]T or ['H]DHT-labelled genital skin fibroblasts (GSF) of a subject with Sa-R'ase deficiency. Within GSF the T-R and DHT-R complexes dissociate with tj of 30 and 90 min at 37\u00b0, respectively, but each type of comp ex dissociates with monophasic, first-order kinetics and is in the \u00abactivated\u00bb state as determined from an Arrhenius plot (27-40\u00b0). After extraction from GSF and partial purification through a G-75 column, DHT-R complexes still dissociate monophasically with the same tJ as above, but T-R exhibit biphasic kinetics -an initial \u00abrapid\u00bb (preactivated) phase (k_ 2 , 40xlO-\u2022 min-1 ) followed by a \u00abslow\u00bb (activated) one The relationship between perinatal changes in thyroid function and tissue respiration was evaluated by measuring hepatic and renal cortical oxygen consumption (Q0 2 ) with and without ouabain (lmM) in tissues from fetal lambs at 121-124 days gestational age (GA) (Group!, n=5), 136-140 days GA (Group II, n=5) and in newborn lambs between 1 and 7 days of age (Group Ill, n=8). Geometric mean triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations (\u00b195% confidence levels) increased from 14.3 (<11.6-21.1) ng/dl in Group I to 40.7 (18.1-91.4) ng/dl in Group II and 504 (424-599) ng/dl in Group III. Serum T4 levels were similar in all 3 groups. Mean (\u00b1SEM) total hepatic Q0 2 values were similar in Groups I and II (34.7\u00b1 4.3 and 24.9\u00b14.l 0 2 /100 mg.hr) and increased to 59.5\u00b14.2 in Group Ill (p<0.01). Sodium transport dependent Q0 2 (total QO,ouabain suppressed Q0 2 ) was significantly greater in Group Ill (21.2+2.2) than in Groups I (11.4\u00b12.7) or II (3.1\u00b10.8), and was decreased in Group II compared to Group I. Non-transport dependent (ouabain suppressed) Q0 2 was similar in Groups I and II (23.3\u00b12.4 and 21 .9\u00b14.5) and increased in Group Ill (38.3\u00b12.9, P< 0.01). Renal cortical total and ouabain suppressed Q0 2 values were similar in the three groups. Conclusions: 1) The increase in T3 concentrations observed in the newborn lamb correlates with an increase in hepatic but not renal cortical tissue respiration; 2) the increase in hepatic respiration is due to an increase in both sodium transport dependent and non-dependent respiration. The effect of T3 treatment on in vitro oxygen consumption (QO,) of isolated brown adipose tissue cells (BAT), liver, kidney cortex, brain and heart was studied in fetal sheep. Thyroidectomy and insertion of a constant infusion pump was performed at 119-121 days gestation followed by 8 days of infusion with either T3 (4 animals, Group I, 24 mcq/hr) or vehicle (4 animals, Group 11). After hysterotomy, animals were sacrificed with barbiturate and decapitation and the tissues were removed. Basal Q0 2 (\u00b1ouabain, lmM) was measured in all tissues; norepinephrine (NE, 10-'M) (\u00b1ouabain) stimulated respiration was measured on BAT only. Cord T3 serum concentrations at hysterotomy ranged between 160 and 502 nq/dl in Group I and were undetectable in Group II. There were no significant qroup differences for basal 00 2 (\u00b1 ouabain, lmM) in any of the tissues studied. NE stimulated QO, significantly increased in Group I (123\u00b118.5) (SEM) 02 /10 6 cells\u00b7hr) vs Group II (55\u00b115.6) (p<0.05). Non-sodium transport dependent ME Q0 2 {ouabain suppressed) was increased in Group I (70!4.7 vs 27.3+7.8) (p<0.01) but transport dependent NE QO, (NE QO, -QO, with ouabain) was not different in the two qroups. Conclusions: Basal respiration in the ovine fetus at 120-130 days is not thyroid hormone dependent. In contrast stimulated BAT respiration increased two-fold suqqesting that thyroid hormones may play an important role in stimulated BAT thermooenesis in the ovine fetus. Three children aged 2, 11 1/2 and 15 years were shown to have variable degrees of thyroid hormone insensitivity. Prior to investigation all three received therapy with either thyroid blocking drugs or thyroid hormone due to wrong clinical diagnosis. Normalization of thyroid hormone levels resulted in hypothyroidism. The older two patients were first cousins. The youngest patient had signs of hypothyroidism including both developmental and skeletal delay which were possibly exaggerated with 8 months of propylthiouracil therapy. The older two patients had goiters and were clinically euthyroid. All subjects had increased levels of thyroxine 14. 4 -21.5 (nl 4.5 to 11.5), free thyroxine 2.7 -4.0 ng/dl (nl 0.8 to 2.3), triiodothyronine 243 -430 ng/dl (nl 100 to 200), and normal thyroxin binding proteins. Serum TSH was normal in 2 subjects and elevated in the 15 year old to 42 1i!U/ml (nl 1.9 to 5). All subjects developed a 30 minute peak response to TRH which was normal in 2 (10 and 16 \u00b5JU/ml} and exaggerated in the 15 year old (291 \u00b5JU/ml}.",

Durinq male sexual development, there are chanqes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis which are modulated by alterations in 24 h secretory patterns of qonadotropins. In order to characterize the pattern in the absence of neqative feedback, we studied pulsatile LH/FSH secretion (q 15 min samples drawn without anesthesia in animals fitted with a vest and mobile tether) in castrated monkeys. Of the 18 monkeys, 4 were castrated at birth, and one each at l, 8, 10, 20, 26, 33, 42 and two at 25 months of aqe, and five were castrated as adults. Pulsatile secretion of LH/FSH occurred as: l) micro-pulses, havinq ampl itudes < 2X over baseline; 2) macro-pulses, where the increase in LH/FSH levels , 2X. The qreatest frequency and larqest amplitude of pulses occurred in adults. In early postnatal life, there were also larqe and frequent pulses but less than in adults. Pulsatile secretion was absent durinq prepubertal life and early puberty. In two animals, castrated at birth and studied at 33 months of aqe (midpuberty), markedly dichotomotous patterns were apparent. One animal had advanced into \"puberty\" and LH micro-and macro-pulses (up to 6Xl were seen with an t frequency and maqnitude of FSH pulses. The other animal retained a prepubertal secretory pattern, even when restudied 4 months later. These data indicate that chanqes in amplitude and frequency of LH/FSH pulsatile secretory patterns occur in the absence of the testis suqqesting pubertal maturation is independent of neqative qonadal feedback. We have previously measured urinary EGF in children using a human placental membrane radioreceptor assay which does not crossreact with insulin growth factor I (IGF I), somatomedin A, or other growth factors or peftide hormones. EGF excretion in normal children was 33.0 \u00b1 2.8 \u00b5g/M /24 hr. EGF excretion was significantly (p <. .02) diminished in GH-deficient children before therapy and was similar to normal in a like group of children after prolonged GH therapy. In this study we have evaluated the relationship between EGF excretion and the length of GH therapy in order to determine whether EGF is a GH-dependent growth factor. Urinary EGF was measured in 5 GH-deficient children before and after .1 IU/kg of GH q 12 hr X 2. There was no significant rise in EGF excretion over 3 days. However, in 7 GH-deficient children treated for 1 month with .1 IU/kg of GH 3X/wk, excretion of EGF rose from 24.5 \u00b1 3.4 J.Jg/M2/24 hr to 40.2 \u00b1 4.8 1.1g/M2/24 hr (p <. .05). The rise persisted during treatment thereafter. Since EGF excretion is enhanced by prolonged (1 month) GH therapy, but not by short-term GH therapy, EGF is not a classic GH-dependent growth factor. Whether EGF represents a delayed intermediate in the mechanism of GH action or whether it is a product of the GH-induced growth effect remains to be elucidated. ",

Since the drug does not promote a more favorable androgen-estrogen milieux its anti-estrogenic effects are achieved primarily at the level of breast tissue. In three infants (2-6 months old) with congenital hypothyroidism, we found that treatment with L-thyroxine (50 mcg/day, 5.7-11 mcg/kg/day) resulted in suppression of their TSH response to thyrotropin releasing hormone (change in TSH < 0.5 uIU/ml), indicating overtreatment. To determine the optimum dosage of L-thyroxine replacement, we studied 19 affected infants and gradually reduced the doses we prescribe. In the table below, we compared, for each age, the mean L-thyroxine dose (mcg/kg/day) that resulted in TSH levels being elevated with that producing a normal level.

Some microsomal cytochrome P450-dependent liver enzymes show sexual dimorphism, that is, they are significantly higher in one sex than the other. In addition to direct effects of the gonadal steroids on the liver there appears to be other pituitary \"factors\" which contribute to the enzyme differences between male and female. We investigated this phenomenon in the rat, looking at the enzyme estrogen 2-hydroxylase which converts estrogens into catecholestrogens. This enzyme is 8-10 times higher in the adult male than the female and is a major degradation pathway which may \"protect\" the male from estrogen exposure. We have previously s!own a 20% decrease in liver enzyme activity in the castrate male rat, and a doubling of activity in the female rat treated with high doses of testosterone. Thus testosterone can not totally account for the sexual difference in enzyme activity. Twelve experimental and 12 \"sham\" operated rats were killed for enzyme assay 7-10 days after surgery. Estrogen-2hydroxylase was assayed in liver microsomes by a radio-enzymatic assay. Hypophysectomy of male rats resulted in a slight (-20%) decrease in enzyme activity. Pituitary stalk transection of the male rat caused a decrease of enzyme activity of over 80% resulting in complete \"feminization\" of the level of enzyme activity. The major hormonal change in the pituitary stalk sectioned animals is a large increase in prolactin. We hypothesize that prolactin may suppress liver enzyme activity. The decrease in inactivation of estrogen could help to explain the hypogonadism of hyperprolactinemic men. Serum estrogen levels (especially estradiol (E2)) are often below limits of RIA sensitivity in prepubertal(PRE) children. E1S, the most abundant estrogen in adult serum, with stable high levels about 10-20-fold greater than unconjugated estrogens, arises largely from precursor sulfurylation in peripheral tissues. To examine other means of evaluating estrogen levels in PRE and hypogonadal subjects, we improved our RIA for E 1 S and related its concentrations to those of E1 and E 2 in children of varied pubertal status. Estrogens were quantitated in 35 PRE and pubertal (PUB) children and in 5 girls with Turner's syndrome. Mean (+SE) E1S levels in PRE girls (106_:!:13 pg/ml) and boys (82_:!:16) were significantly lower than in PUB (406+76) or adult female (follicular phase, 880.:!:117) subjects. All E 1 S levels were above assay sensitivity (6 pg/ml). In contrast, E2 in PRE girls (3.4_:!:.4) or boys (2.8+.5) was often below or at the limits of detectability (2 pg/ ml);-El was 10.6+1.6 in PRE girls and 12.7_:!:3.5 in PRE boys. E1S levels correlated strongly (r).90) with those of E1 and E2\u00b7 In patients with Turner's syndrome, mean E1 and E2 levels were 17.5 _:!:6.3 and 3.3_:!:.S, while E 1 S was 204_:!:56. These data suggest: (1) E 1 S levels are easily measurable in sera from PRE subjects and permit assessment of integrated estrogen status when E1 or E levels are barely detectable; (2) Quantitation of E1S in patfents with Turner's syndrome may help to further define neuroendocrine feedback controlling gonadotropin suppression during mid-childhood or during conjugated estrogen therapy.",

Both parents are of Spanish ancestry and denied consanguinity. Because of the similarity of the findings in this family to those described in Swiss families with IGHD type A (early onset of severe dwarfism, typical physical findings, absence of growth hormone (GH) production following stimulation tests) we examined their DNA for deletion of the GH genes. Restriction endopuclease analysis of DNAs isolated from leukocytes was done using 3<::P-labelled GH cDNA sequences as a probe. The 3 affected Argentine sibs were homozygous while the parents and sib (II-3) were heterozygous for a deletion of about 7. 5-kb which included the normal GH gene, in agreement with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance as well as the clinical phenotype. While the GH gene deletion in this family seems identical to that seen in the Swiss families, the phenotype of the Argentine children differed in 3 respects. First, there was variation in birth length (II-1 : 44, II-2 : 51 and II-4 : 50 cm) although all 3 were born at term after normal gestation. Secondly, prior to treatment, at 7 years of age, II-1 and II-2 differed in height (75 and S3 cm)o Thirdly, during the first lS months of GH treatment, yearly growth was good in II-2 : 10 cm, but poor in II-1 and II-4 (4 and 4. 5 cm) despite high Anti-GR titers in all 3 sibs. The differences in rate of growth of these 3 sibs must be due to factors other than the GH gene deletion. Prior to therapy, these factors may include other genes which modify growth and during therapy genes which effect immunP response.",

An additional two (10%) had ECHO features suggestive of MVP. Thus, the overall prevalence of positive or suggestive ECHO findings was 20% (p < .05). There was no correlation between clinical or biochemical indices of thyrotoxicosis and presence of MVP.

We have used the primate as an animal model to study the pubertal process and male sexual development. We report here cross-sectional and lonqitudinal studies characterizing chanqes in 24 h secretory patterns of LH and FSH in monkeys (Macaca mulatta and fascicularis) from 9 days of aqe through adult life. Monkeys (N=46) were fitted with a vest and mobile tether permitting chronic cannulation. Blood was drawn at 15 min intervals over 24 hours without anesthesia. LH, FSH and testosterone were measured by radi oimmunoassay. Pul sati le secretion of LH anc1 FSH occurred as: 1) micro-pulses, havinq amplitudes< 2 times over baseline; 2) macro-pulses where the increase ) 2 fold over baseline. Throughout, FSH secretion occurred mostly as a steady state undulatinq pattern with occasional micro-and macro-pulses at all aqes. On the other hand, the largest LH pulses (up to 15 times, from a baseline of< 0.9 to a maximum of> 15 of approximately 2 hours duration) occurred in the prepubertal animal and LH micro-pulses at all aqes. larqe testosterone macro-pulses occurred in the early postnatal period, late puberty and adult life. Gonadotropin secretory patterns associated with normal sexual development was hiqhly individual; uniformly the amplitude and frequency variec1. Jn this larqe series of animals, these data indicate that changes in frequency and amplitude of qonadotropin pulsatile secretion correlate with testicular maturation. Hypoxia is a potent stimulus to release of VP. We have shown up to 10% of plasma VP is cleared by the fetal kidney and excreted in urine. We propose that AF-VP may be a marker of fetal hypoxia in the fetal lamb. AF and plasma samples were obtained from 15 chronically catheterized fetal lambs (116 to 141 d gestation) (1) during steady state conditions (control), (2) following exposure of the ewe to 10% FI02 or partial umbilical cord occlusion x 30 min. (hypoxia), and (3) after exogenous VP infusion into AF. VP was reliably extracted from AF in acetone with an 80 \u00b1 4% recovery. VP measured by RIA of AF has an interassay variability of 8% at 4 pg/ml and 10% at 25 pg/ml. Parallel biologic activity of AF VP was confirmed by bioassay. (1) In control state plasma VP (1.8 \u00b1 1.4 pg/ml) did not correlate with AF-VP (1.7 \u00b1 1.4, range 0.5 to 7.5 pg/ml) or change with gestational maturation.",

The actual iCa is influenced by momentary pH changes, which may be irrelevant for the calcium problem under study, but the standardized iCa at pH 7.4 can be misleading if the patient suffers from a persistent pH change. An instrument that measures both actual pH and iCa and calculates a standardized iCa at pH 7.4 will therefore be ideal. We report our experience with such an instrument, the ICAI Radiometer's Ionized Calcium Analyzer. The concentration of iCa was measured both in the whole blood and serum of 20 neonates.

AA was S 10/12 old, his height was 35'', weight 29 lbs and BP 94/58. The serum electrolytes were normal. Serum testosterone rose to 1.8 ng/ml after HCG injections. The basal serum LH, FSH and the LH response to LHRH was similar to that in a 4 year old control subject with undescended testes but the FSH response was much less (9.7 vs 25.3 (peak), 7.5 vs 21.55 (mean)). The patient TS was evaluated twice; in January 1979 (15 11/12 age) and in January 1981 (17 11/ 12 age). Left orchiectomy was done in Aug., 1979. His maternal cousin suffered from PBS: In 1979 his height was 56 1/2'', weight 69 lbs and BP 120/90 and no sign of sexual maturation. In 1981 his height was 60'', weight 94 1/4 lbs, pubic hair stage IV, axillary hair +. but no facial hair. His bone age was 14 years. Basal, peak and mean LH/FSH values (mIU/ml) after LHRH in 1979 were 22.1/19.3, 104/32.1, 86.5/28.7 respectively and the corresponding values in 1981 (after orchiectomy) were 32/138, 313/299, 164.6/ 191 respectively. CONCLUSION: In PBS the impairment in FSH regulation is more pronounced and is seen at an early age. The LH response in 1979 was similar to that of castrate subjects, but the FSH was normal. In 1981 the more marked rise in FSH than in LH suggests greater limitation of inhibin than testosterone production by the remaining testes.

Magnesium deficiency theoretically may be associated with decreased secretion of PTH. We evaluated 6 infants with hypomagnesemi a (HM), serum Mg 1.18\u00b10. 06 mg/dl (mean\u00b1 SE) and 4 with normomagnesemia (NM), following infusion of 6 mg/kg of elemental Mg over one hr. In HM infants, mean serum Mg rose to 2.25\u00b10.1 mg/dl with Mg infusion; mean serum PTH was 42\u00b111\u00b51-Eq/ ml (RIA 1-84 PTH, Ni 57) initially and rose to 77\u00b115, 82\u00b1 19, 66\u00b118, 60\u00b127 and 41\u00b114 \u00b5l-Eq/ml at 1,2, 4,6,12 and 24 hrs vs 45\u00b124, 44\u00b119, 40\u00b114, 41\u00b119, 27\u00b14 and 42\u00b114 \u00b5l Eq/ml in NM infants. By analysis of covariance there was a significant difference between the groups, p < 0.01. Serum CT was 50\u00b117, 54\u00b119, 31\u00b115 and 31\u00b119 (RIA, N < 107 pg/ml) at 0,1,2, and 6 hrs with Mg infusion in HM infants and 221\u00b136, 243\u00b156, 226\u00b138 and 231\u00b140 pg/ ml in NM infants (HM lower than NM, p<.0001, no changes with infusion). Thus 1) in hypomagnesemic infants, serum calcitonin is low and does not significantly respond to Mg infusion, 2) serum PTH rises with Mg infusion in hypomagnesemic infants, 3) PTH response with Mg infusion was significantly greater in hypomagnesemic vs normomagnesemic infants. Thus serum Mg appears to play a significant role in neonatal parathyroid hormone homeostasis, supporting the thesis that infantile hypomagnesemia results in hypoparathyroidism. While receptors for 1,25-(0H)2 vit Dare known to exist in parathyroid glands and PTH is a known stimulus for l,25-(0H)2 vit D production, it is unclear whether this metabolite has feed-back control on PTH secretion, and especially without concommitant elevation of serum Ca. We evaluated 8 infants who were given calcitriol {1,25-(0H)2 vit D) within the first 12 hrs, at 24 to 36 hrs and at 48 to 60 hrs of age as prophylaxis for neonatal hypoca lcemi a. Gestational age was 30. 6\u00b11.1 wks (mean\u00b1SE) and birth wt 1188\u00b1178 gms. Doses studied were 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.75 mcg/kg/dose given intramuscularly; the \"physiologic\" dose of the vitamin is approximately 0.05 mcg/kg/ day. Serum Ca and PTH levels were evaluated through the first 5 days of life. Serum Ca was 7.67\u00b10.46 mg/dl prior to calcitriol injection and 6.8\u00b10.22, 8.5\u00b10.45, 7.2\u00b12.0 mg/dl at 24 to 36 hrs of age, 48 to 60 hrs of age and at 24 hrs after the last injection of calcitriol. The corresponding serum PTH (radioimmunoassay, 1-84 PTH, N < 57) concentrations were 21\u00b14, 19\u00b13, 20\u00b13.5, and 22\u00b11 There was no significant change in serum Ca and PTH over the first 5 days. By analysis of variance, there was no significant dose related difference in the Ca or PTH response elicited. Thus in preterm neonates, administration of relatively high doses of l,25-{0H)2 vitamin D does not suppress parathyroid hormone secretion. In a model of maternal lipemia (L) in the rat, mimicking the conditions occurring in poorly controlled maternal diabetes (DB), we investigated whether glycerol (Ge) metabolism or the levels of its intermediary metabolites were altered in fetal liver and brain. L was induced in pregnant rats by feedings of a high-fat (45%) diet during the second half of gestation. Controls (C) were fed a co111T1ercial ration (4.5% fat). Serum triglycerides were elevatei in L dams ind fetuses. 3-HO-butyrate was higher in L pups (303 -45 vs 179 -22)JM, P< 0.05). Fetuses were studied one day before term. Liver dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) was highe+ in L than in C fetuses (means \u00b1 SEM: 0.86 \u00b1 0.03, n=26, vs 0.64 -0.03, n=26, nmoles/g tissue, P< 0.001). The ratio of GcP0 4 to DHAP in liver was lower in L fetuses (3.87 \u00b1 0.17 vs 4.55 \u00b1 0.28, P< 0.05). However, there were no changes in hepatic Ge kinase, GcP04 dehydrogenase and GcP04 oxidase. Ge metabolism enzymes were also unaltered in brain. These data indicate that in gestational L, fetuses are exposed to a more reduced redox potential environment than in normal conditions. This may contribute to alterations of glucose utilization and be an additional deleterious factor in the intrauterine development of fetuses of DB individuals (Supported in part by NIH grant SOB RR-09128-03). The role of thyroid status on ventricular growth and a-AR's was determined in rat pups rendered 1) Hypothyroid with propylthiouracil {PTU), 2) Euthyroid with PTU and thyroxine (T4), 3) Hyperthyroid with T4 or 4) Control, sham saline injections. Myocardial weight, protein and DNA i.ere similar in Euthyroid and normal rats at postnatal days 5, 15 and 28. Growth in Hypo pups was normal until postnatal day 14 after which heart i.eight and protein content i.ere significantly decreased {p< .01). Ventricular DNA content was not decreased in Hypo rats, thus postnatal hypertrophic but not hyperplastic ventricular growth, is dependent on thyroid honoone. The nuirber of a-AR' s was decreased in Hypo myocardium at all ages studied, e.g. on day 5 of the (-)-[3H]DHA binding (Bmax) was 37\u00b1g in Hypo compared to 63\u00b18 froole per mg protein m\u00b1 S.D. in Euth myocardium, p<.01. The function of the B-AR's was also decreased in Hypo as compared to Euth as demonstrated by a decrease in catecholamine sensitive adenylate cyclase, p<.01. Treatment of Hypo or control pups with T4 (Hyperthyroid) resulted in an increase in heart size, and a-adrenergic receptors. a-AR's are decreased in ventricles from Hypothyroid rats at all ages studied and the decreased production of c-AMP in response to (-)-epinephrine may relate to the decreased nurrbers of a-adrenergi c receptors present on the sarco l emna l membrane. We speculate that thyroid honoone is an important regulator of both myocardial hypertrophic growth and B-adrenergic receptors during development. Free thyroxine levels (FT4) were determined by radioimmunoassay in 96 infants from our Intensive Care Nursery (ICN) and in 32 healthy term infants. Sera for FT4 levels were obtained simultaneously with filter paper specimens for total T4. The mean FT4 level in infants from the ICN was 3.48 \u2022 0.18 (SE) ng/dl and in the healthy term infants was 4.24 i 0.23 ng/dl. FT4 levels from both groups of infants were significantly higher than levels found in normal adults (1.38 i 0.03 ng/dl, p < 0.001). A correlation was noted between FT4 and T4 levels (r=0.52). Like T4, FT4 correlated with increasing gestational age (r=0.60) and birth weight (r=0.59) and was lower in infants with RDS (p < 0.001). Although 66% of the ICN infants had total T4 levels below the statistically selected screening level (5th percentile), these infants all had FT4 levels > 0.8 ng/dl. All of these infants had normal TSH levels and were judged clinically euthyroid. Two additional infants with untreated congenital hypothyroidism had FT4 levels of 0.3 and 0.4 ng/dl.

In both sexes this was independent of the catch-up growth from fasting; thus, a different growth mechauism iS inv()lved in the slow growth recovery after brain injury than is in catch-up growth after F. Radiological Sciences, Irvine, California. X-irradiation (X) of the head of the neonatal rat results in a dose related growth retardation which is resistant to growth hormone and/or thyroxine. In order to determine whether the stunting results from damage of catch-up growth controls we have observed growth during recovery after fasting (F) in X rats and ,.ham-X littermate controls. 36 males and 35 female rats were distributed among non X -non F, non X -F, X -non F, and X -F. 600 rads X-irradiation was given to the head only at 2 days of age. Fasting lasted for 2 days from 40 days of age. Head irradiation per se resulted in a highly significantly lower body weight (p<0.0005) and tail length (p<0.025). At the end of the fast there was a highly significant added reduction of body weight in both sexes in X (p<0.0025) as well as in non X (p<0.0005). At 70 days of age, however, X-F and non X-F of both sexes did not differ from their respective controls with respect to body weight, tail or tibial length. We conclude that although X creates a permanent growth deficit, the catch-up control continues to operate after F. Growth stunting after diffuse head irradiation thus results in a new setting for body size wldch in Blood lead (PbB) itself is a relatively unstable index of lead exposure. An increase in red cell cytidine phosphates (rbc CP) occurs with excess lead exposure during erythrocyte maturation and thus provides evidence of cumulative lead exposure over the antecedant three months. Pyrimidine-5'-nucleotidase (Py5N) is an enzyme of the red cell and reticulocyte cytosol that dephosphorylates UMP and CMP and permits their diffusion from the cell. Rbc Py5N activity is directly and rapidly inhibited by increases in the PbB. Although rbc Py5N fluctuates with PbB, rbc CP remains elevated. Stability of rbc CP was shown in four children, 2-5 years old, with PbB of 58.3 \u00b1 3.8 ug/dl. Chelation with I.M. CaEDTA 50mg/kg/d x 4 rapidly reduced PbB to 28.5 .t 1.5 ug/dl. Py5N was restored from < 40 units/g hemoglobin to normal values of above 100 u/g. Rbc CP remained elevated at 10-50 nmoles/1010 rbc. Persistence of rbc CP despite correction of Py5N suggests that Py5N has limited function in the mature rbc. Fluorescent erythrocyte protoporphyrins (FEP) are also cumulative during rbc maturation in the presence of increased PbB and reflect the inhibition of heme synthesis. Although rbc CP and FEP result from two distinct modes of toxicity of Pb for the developing rbc, both can be used as indices of cumulative exposure to lead. The effects on birth-weight (BW) of gestational age (GA), fetal sex, maternal anthropometric measurements, sociodemographic characteristics, and smoking were studied in a stratified random sample of 1501 singleton pregnancies delivered in Hamilton hospitals over an 18-month period. Information was collected prospectively by maternal hospital chart review, maternal postpartum interview and anthropometric assessment, and newborn examination. Mean BW among singletons was 3316 g. At 40 weeks GA, the 50th percentile BW was 3540 g for males and 3350 g for females. After controlling for GA and fetal sex, the following maternal variables were positively correlated with BW: prepregnant weight, weight gain in pregnancy, stature, bicristal diameter, biacromial diameter, calf circumference, upper arm circumference, triceps skinfold, upper arm muscle area, and subscapular skinfold. Stepwise multiple linear regression, controlling for GA and sex, showed that the most important predictors of BW were: for primigravidas, weight gain in pregnancy, pre-pregnant weight and number of cigarettes smoked daily during pregnancy; for multigravidas, birth-weight of the last sibling. number of cigarettes smoked daily, weight gain during pregnancy, and prepregnant weight. Smoking during pregnancy reduced birthweight by 13. 3 g per cigarette smoked daily. Women who smoked before pregnancy but not during pregnancy delivered inf ants of BW's similar to infants of non-smokers. The present study was to evaluate the effect of total body bathing with 4% Hibiclens (chlorhexidine gluconate) on the rate and extent of neonatal bacterial colonization. Full-term newborn infants were randomly assigned to receive either bathing with HIB or a control solution (castile soap}. Blood samples were obtained on days 1, 2, and 3 of life and analyzed by GC for chlorhexidine. Cultures of the anterior nares and umbilical area were obtained on days 1, 2, 3 and 14 and analyzed bacteriologically. A total of 38 infants (19 in each group) have been studied to date. During the first three days of life HIB had little effect on the bacterial colonization of the anterior nares but resulted in marked protection against colonization of the umbilical region. Eighteen of 19 infants had no bacterial growth by the third day of life. By day 14 colonization of HIB infants was indistinguishable from those washed with castile soap except for a slight increase in colonization by gram-negative bacteria. No percutaneous absorption of chlorhexidine was observed during the first three days of life. In addition, washing with HIB resulted in no increase in adverse clinical reactions when compared with castile soap. Thus perinatal infant bathing with 4% chlorhexidine gluconate is effective in preventing colonization with bacterial pathogens. During years of study in Washington, D.C., hospitalization of children for rotavirus gastroenteritis tended to be more common following a month of cold or dry weather than following a corresponding calendar month of warm or wet weather. Overall, there were 84% more (178 vs 97) inpatients with rotavirus following a set of relatively colder individual months taken as a group than following an equal number of warmer corresponding calendar months taken as a group. Comparable differences were not seen with non-rotavirus gastroenteritis patients. There also were 45% more rotavirus hospitalizations following a set of months with the least depth of precipitation as compared to a set of corresponding calendar months with the greatest depth of precipitation. Rotavirus infection in young infants, the children least likely to be directly exposed to outdoor conditions, showed some of the most marked weather-associated effects. These findings suggest that weather-related low indoor relative humidity and indoor crowding may be key factors in the epidemiology of rotavirus disease. Cases of extrahepatic biliary atresia have generally been observed to occur sporadically. We compared the incidence of extrahepatic biliary atresia in Utah and Idaho to U.S. incidence andevaluated cases for time-space clustering. Cases from 1974-1981 in Utah and Idaho were ascertained by contact with all pediatricians and pediatric surgeons in the two states as well as pediatric surgeons and gastroenterologists in Denver, Seattle, and Portland; the closest referral centers outside the two states. Death certificates were also reviewed in the two states for the past 10 years to assure complete ascertainment. Diagnosis was confirmed by surgical exploration or autopsy in most cases. Expected cases were calculated from the U.S. mortality rate for biliary atresia in 1975 (5/100,000 births). Relative rates were calculated as observed to expected ratios for each time period and geographic area. The incidence of biliary atresia in Idaho was double that in Utah. Cases were found to cluster in eastern Idaho with a 3-4 fold increase over that expected from national rates (p<.01). In both states the majority of cases for the 8 year period occurred in the past three years. Our data suggests that time-space clustering of biliary atresia occurs. This suggests that environmental factors may play a role in the etiology of biliary atresia, but changing diagnostic practices must also be considered.",

We calculated the impact on expected CP rates of these two trends, using three data sources: (1) two studies, each of which provided BW jata on all CP cases in a geographic population; (2) computerized vital records from North Carolina for 1968-77; and (3) BW and nortality data from the Massachusetts WIC Evaluation Project. We first quantitated the relationship between BW and CP risk(Rcp) Jsing data sources 1 and 2: Rep rose exponentially with decreasing 3W using data from either of the CP studies (Rcp=83e-l.01BW, r=-. 93, and RcP=239el. 43BW, r=-. 97). We then applied the derived regression equations to the observed changes in BW-specific survival data (data source 2), using 500g BW categories. illy fewer total births and fewer survivors occurred in most categories below 3500g in 1977 compared to 1g68, resulting in a predicted fall in CP rates of about 6%. Applying the same inalysis to WIC program data (source 3), we found a calculated jecline in CP rate of about 4%. These results indicate that re-:ent advantageous shifts in population BW distribution such as ioted with improved nutrition and prenatal care have more than :ompensated for the increased LBW survival attributed to NICUs in their impact on predicted CP rates. >symptomatic HBsAg carriage, and very rarely fatal fulminant hep-1titis B.

We report four unrelated infants to 16 weeks of age Nho died of fulrninant acute hepatitis B. In each instance the lsymptomatic mother was found retrospectively to be seropositive for HBsAg. One mother was found to have chronic active hepatitis Two mothers were U.S. immigrants from areas of high HBsAg eniemici ty. Since recent trials have demonstrated the efficacy of lepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) in reducing the rate of infan-:ile HBV acquisition, these fatalities likely were preventable. rhe potential value of hepatitis B vaccine in prevention of vertical transmission of HBV is being explored. These four infant leaths dramatize the importance of screening pregnant women for iBsAg, particularly those from populations at increased risk of iB 5 Ag carriage: Orientals, medical personnel, drug addicts, )rostitutes, and those with history of hepatitis. Such prenatal lBsAg screening, with HBIG and/or hepatitis B vaccine immunopro-)hylaxis for infants at risk, will reduce the incidence of infan-:ile HBV infection, with its potentially fatal outcome. Table I To describe the contents of the middle ear in chronic otitis media (OM), a population of 898 children less than 12 years of age having chronic OM of at least three months duration was studied at the time of myringotomy for tympanostomy tube placement. Mucoid effusion, which was found in 48% of the 1,796 operated ears, occurred more often in younger than in older patients, and was bilateral more often than was serous or purulent effusion. Serous effusion was found in 10% of operated ears and occurred more often in older than in younger patients. Purulent effusion was found in 7% of operated ears and was equally distributed by patient age. No effusion was found in 36% of operated ears. Mucoid effusion was the most stable chronic OM state among 117 patients that had repeat surgery an average of 13 months after initial surgery. Preoperative otoscopy showed subtle differences between effusion-free and effusion-containing ears, but did not distinguish among effusion types. Known middle ear bacterial pathogens were cultured from 23% of effusion samples, other bacteria were cultured from 7% of samples, and 17% of the sterile effusions showed bacteria on gram-stain. Effusions which cultured bacterial pathogens contained more phagocytic cells than sterile effusions. Thus, chronic OM is characterized by mucoid, serous and purulent effusion or by absence of effusion. Respiratory bacteria may contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic OM. These observations provide a descriptive base for further investigation of chronic OM. as etiologic determinants in OME. The study waS\"\"PerfOrmed i; -;-research day care center.

The equation could account for 64% of the variance in birth weight, allowing for gestational age & sex of the baby. The correlation between observed and predicted birth weight for the 215 babies was r=0.74. In a field trial, a screening equation involving only demographic/clinical variables derived from 129n mother/baby pairs was used at midpregnoncy for preliminary stratification of mothers likely to hove babies in the lower or upper thirds of a birth weight frequency distribution. Measurements of blood levels of those nutrients & leukocyte biooctivities at midpregnoncy comprisinq the prediction equation were added to further narrow the identification of mothers likely to hove fetolly malnourished or Jorge babies. Two thirds of the mothers in each of these selected groups were randomly assigned a food supplement. The remaining third were controls. To dote, data hove been analyzed for 245 initially screened mothers. For the selected test mothers, correlation between observed & predicted birth weights was r=.68. Thus prediction is both feasible & practical but the number of babies born to mothers whose fetus was thought to be nutritionally disadvantaged is still too small to evaluate the effect of a selective nutritional intervention on fetal growth.

During a 30 month period in the NICU, we have identified 18 infants with septicemia S. viridans as the causative organism. During this period it was the most common etiologic agent in neonatal sepsis. Mean birthweight of the infants was 2990 g (range 900-4500g): mean gestational age was 39 weeks (range 28-42 weeks). 5 of the infants were premature and 6 were low birthweight. There was prolonged rupture of the membranes (PROM) in 8/18 patients and 1 mother had fever prior to delivery. 5/18 infants developed respiratory distress: 3 of these were term. No infant with PROM developed respiratory distress. The majority of the infants presented within 24 hours of birth with signs of sepsis. All infants had blood and other cultures drawn prior to antibiotic therapy. Blood cultures were taken from a peripheral vessel. The blood was incubated in trypticase-soy broth at 37oc for 3 days.

Nontypable strains of Haemophilus influenzae were obtained from middle-ear exudates of children with otitis media. Two strains (BCH-37567 and H-Pr) were shown to have different antigenic determinants of complement-mediated killing by immune rabbit sera. Rabbit antisera to these isolates contained bactericidal antibody in varying titer to additional strains of a small collection. Each of six otitis media isolates cross-reacted with one or both of the two test strains. Circulating antibody in humans may protect against middle-ear infections caused by these bacteria. Sera of healthy humans were assayed for bactericidal antibody directed against strains BCH-37567 and H-Pr. Specific absorption of human sera with bacterial cells showed human antibody to be directed against strain-specific surface determinants. The importance of IgM in the bactericidal reaction of human serum was indicated by failure of bactericidal antibody to cross the placental barrier in most cases and by the susceptibility of this antibody to reduction by 2-mercaptoethanol. The distribution of antibody by age was similar for the two strains. Antibody was not detectable in most cord sera or in those of young infants but had developed in most subjects by two years of age. Thus, prevalence of bactericidal antibody to each of the test strains was inversely correlated by age with the period of greatest susceptibility to otitis media. An unexpected decrease in infection rate in ICU neonates was investigated. We renorted that infection in our ICU occurs in 15-20% of infants with high titer abnormal bacterial colonization of the pharynx. 50-60% of those given antibiotics (during and/or after Rx) and 8% of those not so treated were abnormally colonized.

C. Torch (sponsor, Burton A. Dudding), U of Nevada, School of Medicine, Dept. Pediatrics, Reno Because of recent reports of DPT-associated SIDS and fami 1 iari\u00b7 ty with 5 cases of sudden death in 4 infants and a 3 yr. old, 3.5 to 20 hr after vaccination, the immunization, clinical and autops\u2022 records of 70 of over 200 SIDS cases reported in Nevada and surrounding States in the past 5 years were analyzed. 48 infants had received one or more DPT immunizations prior to death (DPT-SIDS); 22 had received none (n-DPT-SIDS). Mean age of DPT-SIDS at death was 4.5 mo; of n-DPT-SIDS, 2.3 mo. Age-frequency analysis at deatl showed a single peak at 2 mo.of age in then-DPT-SIDS group, and< biphasic peak at 2 and 4 mo. in the DPT-SIDS group. Thedistribution of SIDS cases fol lowing DPT #1, 2, 3 & 4 was 32: 11\u00b74:1. SIDS was not sexually related in either group. Although n-DPT-SIDS cluster\u00b7 ed during the Fal 1-Winter months, DPT-SIDS was non-seasonal. Obvi\u00b7 ous clusterinq of DPT-SIDS occurred within the first three postvaccinal weeks: 6.5% died within 12 hr of immunization, 13% withi1 24 hr, 26% within 3 d., and 37%, 61%, and 70% within 1, 2, and3wl respectively. Such clustering occurred irrespective of the DPT dose received. In bo<h groups death occurred most often in sleep, in healthy, allergy-free infants following brief periods of irrit\u00b7 ability, crying, lethargy, upper respiratory tract symptoms and sleep disturbance. Autopsy findings typical of SIDS (pulmonary an< thymic hcmmorhage and petechia, pneumonitis, vascular congestion, brain edema) were seen in both groups. In conclusion, DPT immunize tion is a major associated and possible causally related factor i1 SIDS. Modification of current immunization practices may be indica ted if further epidemiological studies continue to link DPT to It has been suggested that the efficacy of MMR vaccine in 11 routine 11 use is less than reported in initial vaccine trials under \"experimental\" conditions. To test this hypothesis a group of 301 children who had received their routine immunization in their physician's office or health clinic, between 15 and 26 months of age, were bled 2-21 months after immunization. All serologic tests were standardized such that sera obtained from SO children 15 months of age who had not had MMR or MMR vaccine were identified as susceptible. Sera from 20 health care workers over 30 years of age were \"immune\" controls. It was found that 12.3% of vaccinees and 2 of 20 adults had mumps neutralizing antibody (NA) of <1:2. Only 0.3% of vaccinees and none of the adults had rubella HAI antibody of <1:8. 5.3% of vaccinees and 2 of 20 adults had measles HAI antibody titers of <1:5. Using a more sensitive plaque reduction NA assay, only 1.6% of vaccinees and no adults had measles antibody of <1:10. At a single site where vaccine handling was observed to be inadequate, the failure rate for measles was about three times that found at other sites. It would appear that in acceptable \"routine\" use there is no problem with rubella or measles vaccine. There may indeed be a problem with mumps vaccine.",

Although we concluded that the data appears to be consistent with that of earlier studies by Hill, Forfar, and Peckham there are differences. Acetaminophen has replaced aspirin (50% vs 13%) as the most common OTC drug other than vitamins and iron. Antacid and analgesic usage was higher in early rather than late pregnancy. Diuretic consumption dropped (32% to 1%). Lastly, alcohol and nicotine consumption appear to have a much lower incidence in these women. Whether these differences represent a more accurate picture of drug ingestion by women during pregnancy or whether they can be attributed to medical practice and differences is as yet unclear. Further analysis of data plus a review of birth and death certificatP.s to determine the incidence of various conqenital anomalies is planned.

Nutritional failure is implicated in the etiology of intractable diarrhea syndrome (IDS) following an acute diarrheal illness. Eleven patients (6 wks to 31 mths.) developing IDS were evaluated by history, nutritional assessment, stool studies, stool volumes, electrolytes, small intestinal biopsy. Mean number of days (outpatient plus inpatient) between onset of illness and provision of caloric intake greater than 100 kcal/kg was 26. Nutritional deficiency was identified in 91% of the patients. The serum albumin was less than 3.0 mg% in 50% and less than 3.5 mg% in 80%. Mear. stool volume was 78 gm/kg/24 hr; mean stool sodium was 93 mg/L. Stool studies for pathogens were negative. 100% had a moderate to severe non-infla11111atory villous-crypt lesion. Nutritional correction was the primary mode of therapy; greater than 100 kcal/kg/24 hr was required for a mean of 25 days. Refeeding was successful in 100% using an elemental formula by continuous nasogastric infusion. Factors have been identified which place patients at increased risk for the development of IDS: l) prolonged history of illness with inadequate caloric and protein intake; 2) ratio of actual:ideal weight<.09; 3) serum albumin less than 3.5%; 4) fasting stool volume greater than 35 gm/kg/24 hr and stool sodium greater than 65 meq/L. Nutritional failure following acute diarrhea was the major identified cause of IDS. Early identification employing these risk factors and nutritional management should interrupt the cycle of progressive malnutrition and diarrhea and should decrease duration of illness. Abnormal i11111unoregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of liver disease in children. Utilizing a pokeweed mitogen (PWM)-driven lymphocyte culture technique we evaluated suppressor and helper T-cell regulation of B-cell function in children with various forms of liver disease. Different combinations of B-cells and T-cells from patients and controls were co-cultured in the presence of PWM and the cell culture supernatents were harvested and assayed for IgG. Lymphocytes from 4 patients with hepatocellular cholestasis were evaluated; two of the 4 showed suppression of IgG at 40 and 25% of expected IgG production (BnTnTp)* compared to normal controls of 132\u00b177% (MtSD for BnTn1Tn2).

These findings indicate the need for periodic screening for GS by ultrasound of patients requiring prolonged TPN. Presence of GS may result from prolonged fasting or the primary illness requiring TPN and may contribute to TPN related liver disease.

In 11 patients ages 6 months to 4 years who had had the Kasai procedure for biliary atresia, trace minerals were measured every 3 to 6 mcrrt:hs. Plasma and red blood cell levels of magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn), co.'Jer (Cu), manganese (Mn), were determined using atomic absorption spectrophotmetry. Values were compared to healthy age-matched controls.

Manganese levels were significantly increased and correlated inversly with zinc levels. Zinc and manganese levels are strikingly abnormal in our population of biliary atresia patients who have had the Kasai procedure and appear to correlate with disease severity. The potential clinical significance of these observationsdeserve further investigation. Infants who have had small bowel resection may have malabsorption of minerals and vitamin D; therefore, bonr mineralization could be impaired in these children. We evaluated 18 children two months to five years after they had had resection of 10 to 90% of their small intestine. Serial measurements were made of height, weight and bore 'llinP.ral content and serum values determined for calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase and 25-0H vitamin D. Anthropometric parameters were within 2 SD of the mean of normals in 77% (14/18) of short bowel patients. However, bone mineral content was >2 SD below the mean of age-matched controls in 14 of 18 patients. The bone mineral content vs weight regression line was significantly lower for short bowel patients than for controls (F;6.6 P<.025). The amount of intestine remaining positively correlated with bone mineral content (r;.73 P<,01) in 15/18 children. Mean serum calcium was 9.8 mg/dl (8.6-11.3) and phosphorus 4.7 mg/dl (2.5-6.7). Serum alkaline phosphatase was increased in 5 of 16 and 25-0H vitamin D was normal (10-40 ng/81) in all but one. Impairment in bone mineralization was proportionate to the percentage of small intestine removed in children with small bowel resection. Decreased bone mineral content was identified even when levels of 25-0H vitamin D, calcium and phosphorus were normal. This suggests there may be inadequate mineral absorption or utilization in children with short bowel syndrome. Several reports have shown the superiority of preterm (PT) over term (T) milk in terms of total nitrogen content but a progressive decrease has been noted with postpartum age and little is known about the effect of gestational age.

The distribution of these enzymes along the VCU also varies with development, but previous studies separating cells along the VCU by the Weiser \"washing\" technique have yielded conflicting results. In this study, cryostat sectioning of frozen jejunum provided sequential histological separation of cells along the VCU, enabling comparison of distribution of enzyme activity at various heights of the VCU during development (Table) . While total jejuna! protein increased with age, the protein concentration along the VCU was constant at all ages tested.

The coefficient of variation of the paired ETH2 samples was greater than that for the corresponding ETCO samples for 46 of the 52 patients (p<.001). With CO as an \"internal control,\" this indicates that despite reliable sampling, short-term variability in breath H2 can occur, The causes of this variability are uncertain, but potentially include changes in respiratory function, gut perfusion, gut gas content, and gut surface area for diffusion. Based on 28 paired, simultaneous determinations of the pulmonary excretion rate of 112 (VeH2) and ETH2 in 5 neonates studied repeatedly over a 3-hour postprandial period, the mean difference between individual ETH2 and VeH2 values standardize<l to each infant's respective means was .007 + .140 (range -.273 to +.287). Simultaneous measurements of ETH2and VeH2 were performed on 34 additional infants at a single point in the postprandial interval. The ETII2 and VeH2 correlated over a wide range of H2 elimination (n=34; r=.63; p<.001). Thus ETH2 may reflect VeH2 for a population of neonates, but lack of a better correlation is consistent with the finding that ETH2 is subject to short-term variability, or the relationship of ETH 2 to VeH2 may vary from patient to patient, during the first year of life (10 infants at each month, 306 infants at birth) using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. At birth the concentration was 204 ug/gm, and this declined to 100 ug/gm between 5-9 months, and increased to 130 ug/gm at 12 months of age. Quantity of hair and extent of diaper rash were assessed from polaroid photographs. The two children with the most hair at each month of age (24 children total) had mean hair zinc 133 ug/gm, and the two with the least hair had 108 ug/gm zinc (p < 0.01). Diaper rash occurred significantly more frequently in children with lower hair zinc, and in children with significantly less hair. Diaper rash cleared up promptly in all children given 10 mg daily oral zinc supplements. Breast fed infants had higher hair zinc than formula fed infants. This remarkable fall in hair Manganese has been determined in hair specimens using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Concentration was increased p<0.05 (0.405 ug/gm) in hair from 16 children (average age 8 years) with hyperkinetic learning disability followed in our Child Developnent Center compared to 44 age-matched healthy controls (0.268 ug/gm) followed at a nearby HIP group. Elevated hair manganese in LD children was previously reported by Barlow Pbysiologir. jaundice (5-6 mg% bilirubin) is common and considered normal in newborn infants during the first week postbirth. Subtle forms of bilirubin toxicity may occur at these levels which are considered abnormal in older infants. Early meconium passage is associated with lower bilirubin concentrations. The rectal stimulation which occurs during rectal temperature measurement may aid passage of meconium containing potentially toxic, absorbable bilirubin. The effect of axillary versus rectal temperature measurement on time of first meconium, first yellow stool, total plasma bilirubin, and hospitalization costs was compared in 100 clinically normal newborns assigned randomly to rectal temperature or axillary temperature groups. Bilirubin was measured at the close of the study during metabolic screening at 48-80 hours postbirth (mean 68 hours in both groups). By this time 30 infants in the rectal group, but only 17 in the axillary group, bad passed all-yellow stools. The rectal group bad lower mean bilirubin (5.49 mg% vs. 6.50, p < .05); lower hospitalization costs ($207 vs. $219, p < .05); and a trend towards earlier first meconium (5.9 hours vs. 7.3, p = .19).",

The purpose of this study was to determine whether !VF level as measured by laser nephelometry, a microtechnique, would be predictive of hyperlipidemia. A previous study found that keeping the !VF level below 100 mg/dl avoided hyperlipidemia, but this was not the finding in a subsequent study using a modified fluorometer.",

It appears one must monitor triglycerides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids in the use of IVF in neonates. The role of the enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin in physiologic jaundice in BR and B fed infants remains controversial. To evaluate the reabsorption of bilirubin from meconium we studia:i the fecal excretion of bilirubin and its relationship to increments of serum bilirubin in 10 healthy full term BR and 10 B fed infants in the first 3 days after birth. Maternal medication and type of delivery were not significantly different. Although the incidence of breastfeeding has increased in recent years, the major cause of lactation failure continues to be insufficient milk production. To assess the effect of frequency of breastfeeding on milk production, infant weight gain and serum prolactin, we studied two gropus of mother-infant pairs during the first 2 weeks after delivery. Assignment to groups was determined by day of delivery. Mothers in the low frequency group (n=24) nursed on a routine 3-4 hour schedule, while the high frequency group (n=20) were encouraged to nurse frequently. Mothers recorded the time and duration of each feeding during the first 14",

Blount's disease is a skeletal disorder characterized by bowed legs, tibial torsion, and consistent radiographic changes in the affected extremities. Although the causes of Blount's disease are unknown, obesity has frequently been mentioned in association with the infantile type of the disease. Two cases of infantile onset Blount's disease were observed in massively obese children. In case 1, osteotomy followed by weight reduction halted progression of the deformity despite persistent radiographic abnormalities. In case 2, surgery was followed by unsuccessful weight reduction, and further surgery is now required. A review of 18 patients with Blount's disease seen at this institution int.he last 10 years revealed obesity in 67%. Among the obese patients, highly significant correlations were observed between the% ideal body weight (IBW) and the femoral: tibial shaft angle (r=0.92, p<.001) a11d % IBW and the femoral condyles: tibial shaft angle (r=0.90, p<.001). The 12 obese patients required 26 osteotomies to correct their deformities whereas the 6 non-obese patients required 8. The occurrence of Blount's disease in non-obese children, resolution of obesity despite persistence of Blount's disease, and progression of Blount's disease without obesity suggest that the onset of Blount's disease, but not its course, is independent of obesity. Weight reduction may be as important as surgery in the treatment of Blount's disease occurring in obese children. The concentrations of Cu and Zn in the milk of mothers of premature infants, although slightly higher than that seen in mothers of full-term infants, may still be too low to meet the needs of the growing premature infant. The immunoreactive forms of plasma cationic trypsin (CATRYP) were determined by radio:immunoassay (RIA) in 5 patients with acute pancreatitis. During the course of their disease we obtained daily plasma samples; these were subjected to gel filtration to separate a2-macroglobulin trypsin (a 2 M-CATRYP), a1 -antitrypsin bound trypsin (a1AT-CATRYP) .. 1d trypsinogen, followed by RIA of the colurrm fractions. In 2 patients, early samples contained only increased trypsinogen but after 2 days there was progressive conversion of the zymogen to active trypsin bound to protease inhibitors (azM-CATRYP, a1AT-CATRYP). At autopsy both patients had severe, hemorrhagic pancreatitis. In contrast, only elevated trypsinogen could be detected in 3 patients, with little or no conversion to inhibitor bound trypsin (a 2 M-CATRYP, a1AT-CATRYP) with disease progression. Two of these patients died of complications unrelated to pancreatitis and at autopsy mild, focal, edematous pancreatitis was present. The remaining patient recovered uneventfully. l<e suggest that the severity of pancreatitis may be reflected by the degree of conversion of trypsinogen to a 2 M-CATRYP and a 1 AT-CATRYP. Furthermore, since a 2 M-CATRYP remains active towards some polypeptides (Parathyroid hormone, Angiotensin, Pro-insulin etc.) the presence of circulating a2M-CATRYP may produce many systemic complications of this disease. Nineteen AGA premature infants, BW<l250 gm, were studied from the time that full volume gavage feedings were tolerated until about 1750 gm. 7 infants received a whey predominant premature formu1a; the other 12 infants were randomized between their own mother's milk (6) and fortified-PTHM (6), a 1: I (v/v) mixture of the premature formula and their own mother's milk. The ave daily intake was isocaloric. PTHM was used in the order in which it was expressed and was kept frozen until needed. Nz-balance studies were performed when the infants had gained at least 10 gm/kg/d for 7 days and/or weighed 1500 gms. Findings (mean+ SE) are shown in the table. Formula resulted in a larger daily wt gain (p<0.01) and N 2 -balance (p<0.05) when compared to PTHM. However, the protein efficiency ratio (PER; a ratio of ave daily wt gain to ave daily protein intake/kg) for PTHM was similar to that of formula. Compared to PTHM and formula, fortified-PTHM resulted in a similar daily wt gain and PER, but intermediate N2-balance values. Each type of feeding provides similar nutritional support of wt gain.",

Eight patients had active disease, and 3 had inactive disease according to clinical evaluation. Drug therapy consisted of prednisone (P), and asulfidine (A) in 4, Palone in 3, A alone in 3, and neither in 1. The chemiluminescent response of resting neutrophils from patients was significantly greater than controls (1783 vs 1155 counts/0.2 minute, p<.05) as was the response of stimulated neutrophils (265,115 vs 80,000 counts/0.2 minute, p<.001). In contrast, the ESR and WBC were normal in 9 and 8 patients, respectively. Incubation of neutrophils from patients in sera from controls did not lower the chemiluminescent response to normal; similarly, incubation of neutrophils from controls in sera from patients did not elevate the chemiluminescent response.

Ano-rectal involvement is a frequent complication in patients with Crohn's Disease (CD) and contributes to significant morbidity even when intestinal disease is well controlled. Also, ano-rectal disease is often refractory to treatment including surgery, Prednisone, Azulfidine and local therapy. We studied 4 adolescents, ages 13-17 years, with severe ano-rectal involvement of CD. Diagnosis was established by biopsy demonstration of granulomata. The average duration of CD was 2.5 years (range 8 mos-6 yrs) and that of ano-rectal disease 1.2 years (range 8 mos-2 yrs). Two oatients had involvement of the colon only and two had ileocolonic disease. In the latter 2 patients, intestinal disease was quiescent at the time of presentation despite the ano-rectal complications. Informed consent was obtained prior to therapy with Metronidazole (20 mg/kg/day) which was given for 1.5 to 7 weeks. All patients significantly improved as manifested by a decrease in ano-rectal pain, induration, erythema and abscess drainage. Three patients with sinus tracts showed complete healing. Two of the 4 experienced gastrointestinal upset, and in one treatment was interrupted for 4 weeks. Time of followuo ranged from 3 months to 2 years during which no recurrences were noted. Conclusion: Short term treatment with Metronidazole may be beneficial in the management of refractory ano-recta 1 CD in adolescents. To establish the feasibility of management of bleeding esophageal varices in patients with extrahepatic portal hypertension by injection of a sclerosing agent at esophagoscopy, thirty such injections were carried out during ten fiberoptic esophagoscopy procedures in three children with frequently bleeding esophageal varices as a result of cavernous transformation of the portal vein. The Olympus JIT endoscope was passed after heavy sedation (meperidine, 2 promethazine, 1 mg/kgm, and chlorpromazine, l mg/kgm), Atropine, .01 mg/kgm and topical cetacaine anesthesia. Balloon tamponade was used to occlude the varices, prevent cephalad flow of the sclerosing agent and stabilize the position of the endoscope. A flexible endoscopic injector was passed through the endoscope and into each varix following which sodium morrhuate was injected until the varix was distended (l-4 ml). 3-4 injections were made at each esophagoscopy and repeat esophagoscopy was carried out 1 week later to assess progress or complications. Significant bleeding occured on only one injection and stopped promptly. No other comp l i cations encountered. Our limited experience and short follow-up does not allow us to assess the contribution of this technique to the long term prognosis of children with portal hypertension, but indicates that it is safe, applicable to children, and may be an important alternative to portal systemic shunt procedures in pediatric patients. A need exists for a practical rreasurerrent of nutritional status which does not require carplex equi\u00b5rent. Kanawati and McLaren (Nature 228:573, 1970) described the MHC/FOC ratio which can be obtained with only a tape rreasurerrent. This index of nutritional status has been tested in 27 children (11 female, 16 male) of differing ethnic backgrounds with an age range of 1 to 36 rronths. Other anthroparetric and biochC'llli.cal measurerrents included weight, height, triceps, skinfold thickness, albumin and prealbumin concentrations. MHC/KC ratio correlated well with weight/height and weight/height Z scores with an r value of 0.74. The correlation with skinfold thickness was 0.74. The relationship to serun albtmin concentration was 0. 58. The MHC/FOC ratio did not correlate with weight/age, height/age, or the prealbumin rreasurerrents. Conclusions: 1) The MHC/FOC ratio is a simple and reliable rreasure of nutritional wasting (reduced weight/height). 2) It is largely a function of skinfold thickness (subcutaneous fat deposits). 3) It is independent of age, sex, ethnicity, or stunting of height (height/age). 4) It is insensitive to decreased prealbunin and relatively insensitive to decreased albtmin. The ratio proved to be a sensitive index of nutritional recovery in the longitudinal evaluation of these patients. MHC/KC ratio is a practical tool for detecting nutritional wasting in infants. It is obtained easily during physical examination of the infant. (Supported by USDA/ARS). Case Western Reserve University, !Jepts. of Pediatrics and Medicine, Cleveland",

The system accurately determined BMC on 9 small bone sections (range 29-212 mg/cm) confirmed by ashing of the bone sections (r=.99, S.E.E.=2. l mg/cm). The regression line derived from weight of ashed bones and measured BMC was used to calibrate a bone phantom used in daily ca Iibration.

Measurements of BMC, BW and BMC/BW were made on the radius of 100 appropriate-for-gestational age infants from 22-42 weeks gestation. A series of 4-6 scans were done on each infant (C.V.=3.7%). The range of BMC measured was 21-127 mg/cm. In 78 infants, the arm was repositioned and the scan repeated immediately. The correlation between the two BMC determinations was high (r=0.96,S.E.E.=6.20mg/cm, p<.00?.). BMC correlated with gestational age (r=0.85, p<.002) and birth weight (r= 0.87, p<.002). Four low-birth-weight infants with chronic lung disease were identified as having a disorder of bone mineral metabolism using this improved system. Though BW in these 4 in\u2022 fants increased with time, BMC was decreased and a graph of BMC vs BW shows that these infants fell consistently 2 S.D. below the expected values.

To investigate this we studied 20 infants (x age 7.9 mo) with GER by esophageal manometry and prolonged pH probe studies. Acid clearance time (ACT) was defined as amount of time required for esophageal pH to rise 2 pH units after ingestion of 5 and 10 cc apple juice in sitting and supine position. Swallowing was encouraged by having the inf ant suck on a pacifier. In 12 patients with > 75% normal peristaltic sequences We conclude: 1) Abnormal peristaltic activity is correlated with delayed acid clearance 2) ACT is significantly delayed in sitting vs. supine position. We speculate that abnormal peristaltic activity may be important in the pathogenesis of GER and that the traditional chalasia chair may result in delayed acid clearance. In a 12 month period we studied 25 patients (3 mo-17 yr) with a variety of gastrointestinal complaints. After clinical and laboratory evaluation, CA-1-AT was performed on 72 hour stool collections with serum A-1-AT obtained on day 1. Stool and serum A-1-AT values were determined by radial immunodiffusion against standard anti-sera. CA-1-AT was calculated: CA-1-AT = S x V/P (cc/day) S=stool A-1-AT concentration (mgm/gm); V=stool volume (gm/day); P=serum A-1-AT concentration (mgm%). Ten controls (functional abdominal pain, psychosocial FTT, chronic non-specific diarrhea) with normal albumin values, had a mean CA-1-AT of 2.35+1.77 cc/ day. 9 patients with IBO and/or a history suggesting proteinlosing enteropathy (PLE) were divided into those with and without blood loss (defined as any gross blood or guaiac + stools within one month of the A-1-AT determination).",

A circadian rhythm of jejuna! sucrase activity has been shown previously to make its developmental appearance in the rat at the time of weaning (day 22). The process of weaning constitutes a complex environmental change for the intestinal tract because the diet changes in terms of: a) physical consistency (liquid --+ solid); b) relative proportions of carbohydrate (CHO) and fat (high fat/low CHO --+ low fat/high CHO; and c) nature of the CHO (predominantly lactose--+ starch, sucrose, etc.). There is also a significant change in the rhythmic pattern of ingestion. The aim of this work was to clarify the relative roles of the weanling diet \u00a3.EC!_ se and the timing of the feeding rhythm as cues for the appearance of the circadian rhythm of jejuna! sucrase activity. We found that the rhythm was not present on day 23 if the onset of feeding was not coordinated with the onset of darkness. Conversely, the sucrase rhythm appeared precociously (day 19) in pups weaned onto chow on a schedule in which the onset of feeding was coordinated with the onset of the dark period. To determine whether the composition of the weanling diet is important, pups were weaned onto 3 different liquid diets: A= low CHO (glucose); B =high CHO (glucose); and C =high CHO (lactose). By day 19 a distinct sucrase rhythm was present in B pups, but no rhythm was present in A and C pups. It is concluded that nocturnal ingestion of a high-CHO diet is responsible for the developmental appearance of the circadian rhythm of jejuna! sucrase activity.",

HRP transport rates did not saturate with increasing concentrations of HRP in either preparation. lmM NaF consistently inhibited transport across patch tissue (48:6%, n=S, p<0.002S) but produced inconsistent results with control tissue. Reduction of temperature from 37\u00b0 to !S 0 c resulted in 7S-9S% inhibition of transport in both tissues. We conclude that macromolecular uptake is increased across jejuna! mucosa containing Peyer's patches; this phenomenon does not involve specific receptors and depends Oil metabolism. Our findings support the concept that Peyer's patches perform an antigen sampling function in the gut. The cancer patients showed significant Sl-112% elevations in rates of S (p < 0.02S) and B (p < 0.01); however, the patients were not in a hyperalimentary state and actually had a lower protein intake (p < 0.005) than controls (Table) (two sample t test). The rates of S (p < O.OS) and B (p=O.Ol) were also significantly higher in the L group using the Wilcoxon test. Serum concentrations of ketone bodies in suckling rat pups are six fold greater than in the adult. Serum fatty acids are two fold greater. Pyruvate dehydrogenase in adult rat intestine is inhibited by fatty acids and 3-a hydroxybutyrate (aHB). To detennine if this increase in ketone bodies and fatty acids may influence neonatal intestinal glucose metabolism, we measured the effect of aHB and palmitate on glucose and pyruvate oxidation by suckling and adult rat intestinal slices. Glucose oxidation to C02 by developing rat intestine increased from suckling rates of 0.69 to 1.26 n mole/mg/hr in the adult. In the presence of aHB (2 mM), glucose oxidation by adult intestine decreased by 50%. However, aHB did not inhibit glucose oxidation in suckling rat intestine. Palmitate (l mM) inhibited glucose oxidation by approximately 25% in both suckling and adult intestine. Pyruvate decarboxylation to C02 by developing intestine increased from 2.1 n mole/mg/hr in suckling rats to 2.88 in the adult. aHB inhibited pyruvate decarboxylation by 30% in adult intestine and only by 10% in suckling intestine. Exogenous aHB does not inhibit glucose or pyruvate oxidation in the suckling rat intestine but does inhibit oxidation in the adult intestine. Glucose oxidation in suckling rat intestine therefore appears to be inhibited by endogenous ketones. Exogenous palmitic acid inhibits glucose oxidation in both suckling and adult intestine. these data suggest that ketones are important for regulation of intestinal metabolism during development. \u2022 538 W \u2022. :.

PA alone was ineffective. The role of PA in zinc absorption was therefore studied in groups of rats, 6 each. r,roup A received a tryptophan (tryp) deficient diet that contained half normal dietary zinc requirements, 6ppm, while pairfed controls received the same diet with normal tryp and 12 ppm zinc. Group A lost weight, developed CNS symptoms (6/6), alopecia (6/6) and diarrhea (2/6). Plasma zinc was 2S -48 pg/dl; controls 91 -llB)lg/dl. r.roups B and C received a tryp and B 3 deficient diet and either 6 ppm (B) or 9 ppm (C) dietary zinc. Pairfed controls were supplemented with PA, 0.2\u00b5g/ml in drinking water. Plasma zinc was lS -S9 ,ug/dl in group B and 38 -88 ,ug/dl in group C. PA supplemented controls had significantly higher values (S3 -77 and 63 -98,ug/dl, respectively) but only a slightly lower incidence of clinical symptoms. In a fourth experiment, tryp and s 3 deficient rats on normal dietary zinc (12 ppm) developed the same symptoms but had normal plasma zinc values. Pairfed controls received either PA or zinc supplements (24 ppm, total). Plasma zinc was normal in all three groups and there was no difference in bone zinc concentration. The data are consistent with the presence of two separate absorption mechanisms, one for low and one for high dietary zinc. PA did not raise body zinc uptake when dietary zinc was normal or increased, but did prevent hypozincemia in rats on a zinc deficient diet. With prolonged survival of CF patients, hepatic involvement has become an important complication. Conventional liver tests may not be helpful since portal hypertension may occur with little changes in liver function studies. Abdominal ultrasonography was performed on a group of 14 patients selected at random from our adult CF population numbering 35. The age span was 20-44 years. The real-time sector scanner was used, delineating longitudinal, transverse and oblique planes. Measurements of portal vein were obtained just proximal to the fonnation of the PV by the junction of the splenic and superior mesenteric veins. Of 108 non-CF patients without clinical or laboratory evidence to support cirrhosis, the PV diameters ranged between 8.5rrm + 2.7 SD under 20 years and 10rrun+2.S SD for those over 20 years of age. Of the 14 CF patients, 9-had diameters between 15 and 20mn. Those with PV diameters greater than 12rrrn had elevated serum alkaline phosphatase. Of those with the widest PVs 3 had splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia. The data suggests that PV diameter measurements by the real-time scanning may be a valuable diagnostic test for recognizing portal hypertension. .001 In summary, infants with onset of NEC in the first 24 hours of 1 ife were larger, more mature and less asphyxiated than infants with later onset of disease. They were fed more vigorously at an earlier age, and the latency period between onset of feedings and onset of NEC was significantly shorter. We speculate that, in these infants, the feedings were more directly involved in the pathogenesis of NEC. We have previously shown that acidic steroids with fewer carbon atoms than are found in conventional bile acids (24 carbons) exist in meconium. Thus, etianic acids (20 carbons) and bis-nor cholanoic acids (22 carbons) are demonstrable. We now show that large quantities of 21 carbon acidic steroids exist in normal human meconium. Methods: Extracts (containing sodium borohydride) from normal full-term infants were subjected to solvolysis and mild alkaline hydrolysis. An acidic fraction was obtained, and was separated into hydroxylated components by adsorption chromatography of the methyl esters. The preparative technics employed have been standardized and extensively tested to rule out artefact formation. Results: Two dihydroxylated C2 1 acidic steroids were obtained and characterized by MS, and by protrn and carbon NMR spectroscopy. The major component was shown to be 3a, dihydroxy-Sa-pregnan-21-oic acid, while the SB-isomer was a second component. Additional minor components were identified. The concentrations of the major component were comparable to those of chenodeoxycholic and cholic acid in meconium. Conclusions: (1) This is the first demonstration of C21 acidic steroids in meconium;",

Preduodenal fat digestion is an important compensatory mechanism in newborns because of immature pancreatic (lipase) and hepatic (bile acid synthesis) function. Hydrolysis of fat in the stomach is catalyzed by enzymes of lingual (LL) and possibly gastric (GL) origin. The developmental pattern and quantitative contribution of these two enzymes to intragastric fat digestion was studied by measuring lipase activity in lingual glands and gastric mucosa of rats from birth until after weaning . AGE ( LL and GL activity was optimal at pH 5.4 and was 2.5-5.0 fold higher on medium (tri 14c-octanoin) than long chain triglyceride. Low activity of GL (1-4% of LL level) and characteristics similar to LL, suggest that GL represents LL adsorbed onto gastric mucosa. High activity immediately after birth, suggests that LL is a major digestive enzyme in the newborn.

Patients hospitalized for less than 1 wk had lCMer PBH at discharge (44\u00b125, n=9, P<.012) than on admission. PBH decreased when glu=se was substituted for glu=se polymer in formulas (34\u00b133 vs 150\u00b182, n=7, P<.01).

Although a considerable amount of information is available about lysosomal enzymes in various mammalian organs, very little is known about lysosomal enzymes of the colon. We have therefore studied changes in lysosomal enzymes, B-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase (HEX), B-D-galactosidase (G), (F) and e-Dglucuronidase (GL) in proximal and distal portions of the large intestine of fetal, newborn, suckling, weanling and adult rats. All these enzymes exhibit substantial changes in activity perinatally. The activity in the proximal colon peaks around the middle of the first week. In the distal colon either no substantial change (G,GL) or a transient peak around day 14 (F) or a steady increase from day -1 until day 80 (HEX) is observed. These changes lead to a shift of the locus of maximal activity from proximal to distal colon. Whereas l to 8-day-old suckling rats exhibited higher enzyme specific activities in the proximal than in the distal colon, the activities were always higher in adult rats in the distal than in the proximal colon. The gradient of enzyme activity along the colon varied more in sucklings (2.3 to 10 fold) than in adults (1.3 to 3.0 fold).",

In an attempt to aid in assessing the nutritional status of a neonate at birth, the subcellular metabolic properties of human placenta were studied. Two preparations were used: mitochondria, obtained by classical techniques and a postmitochondrial supernatant containing microsomes and other cytosol components of placental parenchyma. Results: Human placental mitochondria obtained from full-term normally grown infants consume 02 at specific rates (11.00 to 20.00 nmoles 02/ min/mg mitochondrial protein). Measurements of state 3 and 4 respiration rates led to respiratory control ratios from 1.00 to 1.74. Adding some essential nutrients (e.g. thiamine pyrophosphate) increased frequently the 02 consumption this suggests a state of unsaturation with respect to the nutrient tested. Postmitochondrial supernatants were used for multi-test evaluation and demonstrated consistency of albumin, globulin, SGOT, lactic dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, and creatinine content. Because placental parenchyma was found to contain high concentration of ascorbic acid (from 8.9 to 11.6 mg/100 g tissue) and this is associated with oxygen metabolism, the level of superoxide dismutase in the umbilical blood was assayed and found to be consistent from 9 to 24 units/g Hb).

A, E, C and Carnitine is constant during 7 wks lactation, (2) concentration of Zn, Cu, Vit E and Carnitine decreases during lactation, {3) Zn content is lower in the first 2 wks of lactation in mothers .::_30 wks, (4) individual variation in concentration is enough to suggest that some infants may need vitamin or zinc supplements in addition to their own mothers milk. EGF is a small polypeptide that stimulates proliferation and differentiation of a variety of cell types, including bowel epithelium. Since there is biologically active EGF in breast milk, it is possible that EGF may promote optimal growth and/or maturation of the bowel epithelium in premature infants. Immunoreactive (IR) EGF has previously been found at concentrations of 50 ng/ml in isolated samples of mature breast milk, but its levels have not been systematically analyzed. We studied the IR-EGF content in breast milk as a function of duration of lactation in 13 mothers delivering at or before 32 weeks gestation. Expressed breast milk was collected for 24 hours once a week for 6 weeks. Representative results are as follows: These data indicate that: (!) IR-EGF production in milk is not a function of duration of lactation; (2) concentration of IR-EGF varies widely from the milk of one mother to another, but (3) total daily production is similar; and (4) IR-EGF concentrations in the breast milk of mothers delivering prematurely may exceed those of mothers delivering at term. Studies have shown that low-birth-weight (LBW) infants experience a faster rate of weight gain when fed a more calorically dense formula with a higher protein content than those receiving pooled human milk. Recent data indicate that the composition of \"preterm\" human milk differs significantly (protein, Na, Cl) when compared with pooled term human milk and may be adequate to meet the preterm, LBW infant's needs. It has not been shown that the pre term LBW infant fed his own mother's milk \"ad 1 i bi tum\" wi 11 simulate the growth of the formula-fed infant. To compare growth, 9 breast-fed (BF) and 9 standard 20 calories/oz formula-fed (FF) preterm LBW infants were matched for gestational age (GA) and To determine if exogenously administered prostaglandins affect growth or biochemical ontogeny, prostacyclin(PGI2) and 16,16 dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (l6,l6DPGE2) were administered to infant and weanling rats.",

Subnormal net transport of Na+ across affected epithelial cells could underlie both the sweat ion abnormality and the exocrinopathy in CF. This unifying concept was tested by assessing electrogenic Na+ transport in colon where the epithelium is involved in the disease and generates a measurable transmucosal potential difference (PD) by Na+ transport. The resting PD across the rectal mucosa was measured in 22 CF patients and 20 normal controls, together with the effect on this PD of the diuretic drug amiloride, which specifically blocks channels for passive Na+ diffusion and inhibits electrogenic Na+ transport. The resting PD was determined between an isotonic saline-filled, rectal catheter connected to the recording electrode and a silver chloride-silver plate applied to a site of intradermally injected normal saline as the reference electrode. The mean resting PD was -26.5 \u00b1 6.0 mV (mean \u00b1 SEM) in controls and -14.5 \u00b1 5.0 mV in CF patients, a difference not statistically significant (P> 0.25). Amiloride induced a dose-related decrease in the transmucosal PD in all subjects, confirming Na+ transport as the basis for the PD. The decrease was 6.0 \u00b1 2.5 mV at 10-6M, 15.8 \u00b1 3.0 mV at l0-5M and 27.0 \u00b1 4.4 mV at l0-4M amiloride in controls as compared with 1.0 \u00b1 1.3 mV, 7.4 \u00b1 1.9 mV and 18.9 \u00b1 3.4 mV in patients, respectively. The lesser amiloride effect in CF was significant at lo-SM (P<.01) and l0-6M (P<.05) amiloride and suggests alteration of Na channels in CF. (Supported by NIH Grant AM-10956). The effect of a high protein (2.5g/kg/d) diet consisting of lean meat, fish and poultry on the mineral status of 10 obese adolescents was studied. The diet was continued for a total of 3 months and was supplemented with minerals and vitamins. K, Mg and Ca balances were measured during the baseline and after 2 weeks on the diet. Total body potassium (TBK) and red cell (RBC), Kand Mg were measured during the bascl ine 7 at 2 weeks and 60-90 days. Nr.> change was seen in Ca balance; the data for Mg and K are given below. Of particular note is the absence of any significant change in RBC K despite a significant fall in TBK. Over 95% of TBK is in cells. It follows since there were no cl1anges in hemoglobin, 11ematocrit or red cell count, that in this model the red cell does not reflect the K changes in other cells. Although there was no worsening of Mg balance after 14 d on the diet there was a consistent fall in RBC and serum Mg (from 1.82\u00b1011 to 1.68\u00b10.08 mEq/L). Both values are still within normal ranges but the falls are of particular note in light of the obese adults who died of ventricular fibrillation on liquid protein diets. Sci. 119:1109 Sci. 119: , 1965 . A similar event was identified in two children who developed metabolic acidosis and peculiar neurologic symptoms in response to increased dietary carbohydrate after major small bowel resections. Both children were found to have t\u00b7lcvated plasma levels of D-lactic acid (4.0-9.87 raM/L, normal 0. 05-0. 07 mt1/L) \u2022 Acid-bast\u00b7 and ncurologic abnormalities respondvd immediately to neomycin therapy. runongst a number of microorqanisms isolated from stool cultures of these patients, one THI is thought to be uncommon; gastrointestinal manifestations have only recently been recognized, and potential small bowel lesions have not been defined.From a group of 370 children evaluated for chronic diarrhea in a subspecialty clinic over a 5-year span, we identified 40 patients with THI (10.8\\). Criteria for diagnosis were: reduction in one or more of the 3 major immunoglobulins (lg) of 2 S.D. or more below the mean for age, absence of nonspecific gut protein loss, presence of specific antibody production, and subsequent rise in lg levels with age. Investigation of diarrhea included small bowel biopsy in 26 patients; normal mucosa was present in 14, patchy enteropathy in 7, and partial or severe diffuse villous atrophy in 5. Duration of diarrhea was similar in those patients with and without histologic abnormalities (16-1-ll vs 2 mos.). lg deficiency was prolonged in patients with patchY enteropathy as compared with patients having normal bowel mucosa (36.8+9.0 vs 17.2+8.0 mos., p<0.01). Six patients had serial small bOwel biopsieS over a mean observation period of 39 months; in 4, repeat biopsies were normal. In 65\\ of patients with THI, diarrhea resolved before Ig began to rise. CONCLUSION: 1) These data describe for the first time the histologic spectrum of enteropathy associated with THI, 46% of patients having patchy or diffuse villous lesions; 2) chronic diarrhea may be the sole clinical manifestation of THI; 3) small bowel mucosa! abnormalities in THI are associated with more prolonged lg deficiency. To compare the effect of human colostrum (l-3 days) and mature milk (314 + 150 days) on PMNL function, Ficol l-Hypaque separated PMNL from bl cod of 78 heal thy volunteers were i ncubated with whole colostrum, colostral lipid and colostral aqueous phase from 39 mothers or with mature whole milk, and its separated components from 39 mothers and tested for resting and zymosan stimulated oxidative metabolism, functional activity and the presence of Fe receptors. Stimulated oxygen consumption, quantitative NBT dye reduction, 1-14c glucose utilization and Fe receptors were significantly (p<0.05 to p<0.001) less in PMNL exposed to whole human colostrum or colostral 1 ipid than in non-lipid exposed cells or cells exposed to the aqueous phase of colostrum. In contrast PMNL exposed to whole mature milk or to its lipid or aqueous phase had no significant decrease in any of these parameters when compared to non exposed cells. In assays of phagocytosis, colostral PMNL or blood PMNL exposed to colostral lipid had a significant (p<0.001) decrease in their ability to ingest 3H methyl thymidine labeled S. aureus when compared to non-1 ipid exposed PMNL. Blood PMNL exposed to lipid from mature milk had no decrease in ability to ingest S. aureus. Lipid or lipid soluble material present in human colostrum but not mature milk causes inhibition of phagocytosis and respiratory burst related activities in PMNL. Supported by NIH grant HD13021. ",

The nutritional status of 60 critically ill medical patients with normal hydration status and without chronic organ failure was evaluated by anthropometric techniques within 48 hours of admission to the ICU. Daily assessments of physiologic stability were done using a new, validated, scoring system (Physiologic Stability Index, PSI) based on the degree of abnormality of 34 physiologic variables (e.g. BP, HR, CVP, PCWP, cardiac output, ABG's electrolytes, ICP, Glascow Coma Score). Overall, the incidenc\u00b7e of nutritional depletion was acute PEM -13%, chronic PEM -10%, fat store depletion -38%, and somatic protein store depletion -8%. Pts. with acute PEM had PSI scores indicative of more physiologic instability (higher scores) compared to pts. without acute PEM. Chronic PEM and depletion of fat or somatic protein stores were not significantly associated with high PSI scores. We conclude that critically ill children with acute PEM have a higher level of physiologic instability compared to children without acute PEM. Acute PEM seems to be a contributing factor to this instability. This information is important in evaluating the need for nutritional therapy. We studied specific features of emotional adjustment in children age 8-16 with abdominal pain. In 4 study groups I) Crohn's disease, n=24 2) ulcerative colitis (UC) n=20 3) non-organic, recurrent abdominal pain (RAP), n=l6 4) healthy school children, n:=30, we used a self report technique to measure self-esteem, helplessness, self-blame and depression as well as psychological stress occurring in the year preceding onset of symptoms.

Compared with controls, children with Crohn' s disease demonstrated depression (p( O. 025) and low self-esteem (p<0.005); those with UC, depression (p<0.05); and those with RAP, very low self-esteem (p<.O. 005). Incidence of stressful events also differentiated the 4 groups (p<O, 025), with the Crohn 1 s children \"reporting the highest number.

For euthyroid pups aged 7, 14 and 17 days the milk intake during a 2-hr suckling session was the same in pups fasted for 16 hr as in pups which were allowed to feed until the time of testing. Only on day 21 did the euthyroid pups display greater milk intake when in the fasted state than in the fed st-ate. This maturation of fed/fasted differences of milk intake was advanced to day 17 in hyperthyroid pups. Conversely, propylthiouracil-induced hypothyroidism prevented the normal development of feeding controls, indicated by failure of these pups to display fed/fasted differences of milk intake even at 21 days of age. The results of the studies of nipple attachment latency indicated that thyroid status has only a modest effect on the tendency to initiate suc:.ling.

They were treated with a high fiber diet and counseling to assure the parents their child was not ill, the stooling pattern was not harmful, and enhanced dietary bulk would improve the symptom. They were instructed that this was not a \"diet\" but a pattern of healthy eating for both children and parents. The outcome, one to three years after the initiation of the diet, was evaluated by questionnaire, and 26 responded. Compliance with the diet was good; an 89% increase in fiber foods was observed. This increase did not reflect a general liberalization of the diet although many patients had been on elimination diets. For example, dietary fat, considered by some to be important in the pathogenesis of this syndrome, increased only 13%.

Because the breast is a modified sweat gland and the electrolyte composition of sweat is abnormal in CF, concern has been expressed that CF breast milk also might contain high levels of Na an<l Cl which could endanger the neonate. Protein content might also be abnormal. To examine this question we analyzed the chemical composition of 72 breast milk samples obtained within the first two postpartum months from two women with cystic fibrosis. Na, K, Cl, osmolality, total reducing sugar, total fat and total protein were determined. Na levels ranged from 22-2 mM in colostrum and decreased to 7-8 mM in mature milk. Cl ranged from 29-5 mM in colostrum and decreased to <15 mM in mature milk. K+ was rather constant (15 mM) in one patient but ranged from 2-16 mM in the other. Osmolality ranged widely (70-238 mOsm/kg) in colostrum but was about 220 mOsm/kg in mature milk. Total reducing sugar (80-85% lactose) was 6-8 g/100 cc in mature milk. Protein content was <l.l g/100 cc in both colostrum and mature milk. These data show that the Low Na levels and the low renal solute load of human milk protect breast fed neonates against the development of hypernatremia. We have identified a 33 year old gravida 3 para 2 Caucasian female who after each of two pregnancies produced mature breast milk with high Na levels (64mEq/L and 13-36mEq/L respectively) in the absence of abnormal salt intake or any significant clinical findings.

            "text": "Since extrahepatic biliary atresia (EHBA) is commonly presumed to be the result of an unknown intrauterine viral infection, we decided to investigate this possibility when we observed two sets of twins discordant for EHBA. One set of twins were dizygotic since they were discordant for sex. The other set of twins had two males, so erythrocyte typing and mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC) were performed to determine the zygosity. On the basis of these studies, the twins were monozygotic (p<0.0026). Viral infections acquired in utero are predominantly concordant when twins are affected while toxic substances usually cause discordant injuries to twins. We then decided to examine the cases to find evidence for what this toxic substance might be. The thirty cases of EHBA seen at our institution during 1972 to 1980 were clustered significantly with more cases coming from farming areas of northeast Texas (p,5Xl0-7 ) and more cases being born during the months of August through October (p<0.015) than would be expected based on a random distribution among the number of live births in our referral area. Spitz has reported that all the morphologic changes of EHBA can be produced in fetal sheep by surgical ligation of the extrahepatic bile duct during the 80th day of the 155 day gestation of sheep. If a similar timing of the insult in humans is assumed, the mothers would have exposed to the toxic substance during early spring in the farming areas of northeast Texas. Since this is a time of plowing, toxins from the soil may be causative in EHBA. Biotin deficiency is characterized by an erythematous skin rash and alopecia which accompanies the biochemical abnormalities. We now report an 18 mo. old white male with developmental delay since 4 mos. who was identified as having biotin deficiency prior to the development of these typical cutaneous symptoms. At 14 mos. his mother placed him on a diet consisting of whole milk and 2 raw eggs/d. The child developed ataxia at 17 mos. but had no skin lesions or alopecia. At 18 mos. he had a mild acidosis and excreted p-hydroxyisovalerate (1.3 mg/mg Cr) and ate (0.02 mg/mg Cr). The activities of propionyl CoA carboxylase, p-methylcrotonyl CoA carboxylase and pyruvate carboxylase in his peripheral blood leukocytes were 12%, 6% and 8% of normal, respectively. His serum biotin concentration was <0.1 ng/ml (nl 0.5-0.8 ng/ml). One wk after changing his diet to formula supplemented with biotin (10 mg b.i.d. ), his serum biotin concentration became> 25ng/ml, his urine cleared of abnormal organic acids and his leukocyte enzyme activities returned to normal. Enzyme activities and urinary organic acids remained normal after 6 wks of biotin at 300 \u00b5g/d (U.S. RDA). Although developmental delay and ataxia continued, a CT scan of his brain and an EEG were normal. The present case is the second report of biotin deficiency in a child caused by dietary indiscretion and indicates that the biochemical abnormalities may precede the cutaneous symptoms. Furthermore, it reemphasizes biotin's important nutritional role.",

Prompted by this observation, we reviewed the outcome of our neonates (BW 500-1500 gm) who received lndomethacin during the past 5 years (1976) (1977) (1978) (1979) (1980) (1981) Juvenile multiple carboxylase deficiency (MCD) produces characteristic clinical findings of altered biotin metabolism (ataxia, alopecia, lactic acidosis, dermatitis, keratitis) associated with subnormal plasma and urinary biotin. A 5 yr old WF developed this syndrome in spite of a normal dietary biotin intake and required biotin supplementation to remain symptom-free. To investigate the source of her biotin abnormality, biotin (10 mg/day) was discontinued and her biotin absorption and excretion kinetics were measured. After 30 days she showed increasing signs of irritability; at 35 days an erythematous periocular rasil at 42 da}S she complained of muscle pains. Acidosis, ketonuria and ataxia did not occur. A friable hypopigmented longitudinal band 10 mm long appeared at the growing end of her hair following this period. Plasma biotin declined from 29,639 pg/ml (while on 10 mg biotin/ day) to 143 pg/ml (on day 42).

Various tests have been advocated to distinguish between neonatal intra and extra-hepatic cholestasis. Of these, liver biopsy (LB) has been the most valuable. The purrose of this study was to confirm earlier reports that PS can replace LB to exclude extra-hepatic biliary obstruction (EHBO). Ten infants with NC were studied with routine tests besides PS and J.B. Nonvisuali!;ation of the isotope in the bowel at 24 hours was taken as evidence of total obstruction (TO) consistent with EHBO. Eight patients had PS before and after at least 10 days of medi\u00b7 cal treatment with phenobarbital and cholestyramine.",

Oral H218o administration and micro Although the clinical association of GER and obstructive pulmonary disease is well established, the physiologic mechanism that results in airway obstruction is unclear. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of intraesophageal and intratracheal acid on airway resistance in the cat. Anesthetized cats breathed spontaneously a hyperoxic gas mixture(50%02) through an endotracheal tube. Upper and lower esophageal sphincters were located by manometry. Intrathoracic pressure(P) was measured by intrapleural catheter, air flow(V) by pneumotachograph and Jung volume(V) by flow integration. Total pulmonary r.esistance(R) was calculated from the simultaneous measurement of P,V and V. Results show: I) Esophageal instillation of up to IOcc of 0.2N HCl at various levels produced no significant change in R from control. 2) As little as 0.05cc of intratracheal 0.2N HCl produced an instantaneous increase of 455%+70%(mean+SE,p<.OOI) from baseline resistance,an effect which was reversible by I minute postinfusion. In contrast, up to 0.5cc of intratracheal saline had no effect on R. 3) Bilateral cervical vagotomy abolished the response to intratracheal acid. Conclusion: These studies demonstrate a dramatic vagally mediated reflex bronchoconstriction following minute quantities of intratracheal acid,but no effect on airway resistance of esophageal acid alone. The results suggest that acid-induced bronchospasm may occur in GER without clinical evidence of aspiration. The relationship between serum ceruloplasmin, the major copper containing protein in serum, as measured by radial innunodiffusion, and copper oxidase (J. Lab. Clin. Med. 58:161, 1961) , which is a measurement of the oxidizing capacity of ceruloplasmin, was serially determined in 31 relatively well, growing premature infants over the first 16.5 weeks of life. Mean birth weight of infants was 1230gms. (range 820-1560gms) and mean gestational age was 30.l weeks (range 26 to 33 weeks). A total of 134 ceruloplasmin and copper oxidase measurements were compared using linear regression by the method of least squares. Correlation coefficient between the two tests was r=. A score of 0 (no significant deviation from norm for age) to 3 (significant deviation from norm for age) was given in each of 10 categories: % ideal body weight, % weight change, percentile for weight/height, right triceps and subscapular skin fold thickness, arm muscle circumference, skin tests (dT, Candida, and transferrin, and absolute lymphocyte count. Absolute lymphocyte count was not found to be a helpful indicator of nutritional deficiency in any age group nor was percent weight change in the child under two years of age. A minimul of 5 tests or 15 possible points had to be scored for the assessment to be considered reliable. Actual points scored was divided by total possible points and a percentage score was derived. Scores of <20% were considered indicative of normal nutritional status, 21-35% mild, >35-50% moderate, and >50% severe malnutrition. Serial assessments were used to quantitatively document the nutritional progress of patients hospitalized for longer than two weeks. Using this assessment, children hospitalized for deprivational failure to thrive, for example, generally displayed preservation of visceral proteins, but depletion of body fat, decreased arm muscle circumference and ultimately poor growth depending on the duration and degree of the deprivation. intestinal rinse (SIR) tryptic activity and SIR iBSA were measured after four hours. Plasma from the trypsin-BSA treated group hRd significantly less (p<0.005) iBSA (0 ug/ml) than the saline-BSA (4.72:_0.8 ug/ml) and aprotinin-BSA group (7.42:_1.2 ug/ml). SIR tryptic activity was significantly increased (p<0.05) and SIR iBSA significantly decreased (p<0.005) in the trypsin-treated animals compared to controls and aprotinintreated animals. In additional studies, newborn (n=29), two (n= 11) and four (n=8) week old rabbits were given aprotinin or saline followed by gavage with 200 mg BSA/100 gm body weight. The newborn and two week old animals treated with aprotinin had significantly increased plasma iBSA compared to saline-treated controls (p<0.001). However, no plasma iBSA was detected in any four week old rabbit. These studies suggest that pancreatic function may influence the uptake of intestinal antigens r.arly in life, but later in development it does not appear to be as important in protecting tt1e animal from antigen absorption.",

Five term infants with appropriate birth wts fed Similac 20, a \"humanized\" cow's milk formula (P 39 mg/dl, Ca:P ratio 1.2:1) had hypocalcemic tetany at 5-9 d. Initial serum Ca (mean\u00b1S.E.) was 6.8\u00b10.12, P 9.5\u00b10.2, and Mg 1.6\u00b10.1 mg/dl, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) was elevated 78\u00b114 \u00b5lEq/ml (RIA 1-84 PTH, Ni57). On restoration of normocalcemia with Ca supplements, feeding was resumed with \"humanized\" formula. Controls were 18 term exclusively breast fed (breast milk P 10-14 mg/dl Ca:P ratio 2.3:1) infants 3 wks. to 6 mos of age. In tetanic infants, relative hypercalcemia 10.4\u00b10.05 mg/dl occured at 6 wks (vs. 9.2\u00b10.3 in breast fed, p<.025) till 12 wks; relative hypermagnesemia 2.26\u00b1 0.01 mg/dl occured at 4 wks (vs. 1.92\u00b10.07 in breast p<0.05) till 8 wks. Mean serum P declined steadily to 6.2 mg/dl at 16 wks (n.s. vs. breast). Mean serum PTH progressively rose to 74, 73, 143, 103, 96 and 75 \u00b5ljEq/ml at 2,4,6,8, 12 and 16 wks (vs. mean 28 to 35 in breast p< 0.005).

We speculate that acute hypocalcemic tetany was induced by the relatively high P load even in \"humanized\" cow milk formulas (vs. breast milk); with continued P loading, serum PTH rises as secondary hyperparathyroidism develops, maintaining normophosphatemia and eventually resulting in relative hypercalcemia and hypermagnesemia. In preterm infants, the bile acid(BA) pool increases nearly two-fold from 11-35 days independent of dietary regimen(ie, human milk(HM), formula(F1l.F1 supplemented with taurineOO umoles%)(F2),or F1+ Taurine + Cholesterol 12.7mg/dl(F3) whereas,maintenance of BA conjugation with taurine requires HM or taurine supplementation (Pediatr. Res.14:512, 1980) . In these previously studied infants and 41 additional preterm infants fed the same dietary regimens from 3 days of age, intraluminal BA concentrations were higher by II days of age in the HM fed vs. F1,F2 or F3, 8.1\u00b1_1.3 vs. 4.0\u00b1_1.0, 2.5\u00b1_0.5 vs. 4.3\u00b1_0.5 mM (p<O.Ol)(Avg.\u00b1_SD), a difference which was maintained at 21 and 35+9 days when infants reached 2400 grams. The difference is due to-greater amounts of chenodeoxycholic acid(CDCA) irrespective of conjugate status. BA kinetic studies demonstrate that by 11 days,CDCA pool is greater in HM vs. formula infants 4.3\u00b1_1 vs. 2.0\u00b1_lmg/kg(p<.001) which was maintained at 2400 grams 11.6\u00b1_4 vs. 4.1\u00b1_2 mg/kg (p<.001) and the fractional turnover rates were lower 0.32+0.04 vs. 0.69+0.2 and 0.17+0.l vs. 0.43+0.2 (p<.001). Total CDCA synthesishowever remained similar in both groups at both time points 1.5+0.2 vs. 1.5+0.2 and 1.6+0.4 vs. 1.3+0.6 mg/kg/day. Conclusion: !)BA-pool and intraluminal BA-and fat absorption increase with age in all infants independent of taurine and/or cholesterol supplementation. 2)HM alters BA kinetics as early as II days with increased CDCA conservation and reduced turnover. This suggests that HM feeding per se uniquely influences intestinal and possibly hepatic function independent of developmental factors. ",

            "text": "because of the use of either a liquid meal or of heat for lipase (L) inactivation. Boronic acid (B) has been shown to inhibit L activity. It was therefore of interest to use B for the study of intraduodenal digestion of fat in 2 CF patients and 2 controls following a solid meal. Inhibition of L activity was obtained by adding B to each aspirate collected at 5 min intervals over a 3 hr period. Micellar incorporation of lipids was measured after overnight ultracentrifugation. Total L and phospholipase (PL) activity was determined with and without a concomitant duodenal perfusion of pancreatic enzymes (PE). Low pH and low values of L and PL were found in CF. A good correlation was present between pH and activity of both enzymes. Only 36.7% and 39.4% of perfused L and PL were recovered during their perfusion. The extent of lipolysis in controls (18%) and in CF (7.8%) was surprisingly low and the degree of phospholipid hydrolysis was 55.8% in controls and 34.1% in CF. Bile acid concentrations were still within the range sufficient to form micelles in CF. Micellar solubilization of lipolytic products (42.2%) was higher than previously reported but comparable to controls and uninfluenced by the intraduodenal perfusion of enzymes. The extent of lipid and phospholipid hydrolysis rather than micellar solubilization limits fat digestion in CF. Correction of duodenal pH is necessary for improved efficacy of PE supplements. The failure of the Gunn rat to conjugate bilirubin is possibly related to the microsomal membrane matrix of bilirubin UDP-glucuronyl transferase (Odell ,GB et al :Hepatology 1:307, lg81). To examine this, hepatic microsomes were isolated from Gunn (jj), outbred normal Wistar (JJ), and heterozygote (Jj) rats and were subjected to the following studies: Lipid analysis (gas chromatography and phosphorus determination following solvent extraction) of 5 preparations in each group demonstrated no differences in the ratio of cholesterol to phospholipid nor the percent contribution of these lipid components and individual fatty acids to the total lipid. Steady state anisotropy values of l,6-diphenyl-1,3,5 hexatriene, determined at 37\u00b0c and l0\u00b0c in microsomal membranes from 5 rats in each group, did not differ among the groups. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of 7-doxylstearic acid incorporated into microsomes from one rat in each group, done at 6,10, 20,25,30 and 38\u00b0C, were superimposable at each temperature. Arrhenius plots of glucose-6-phosphatase activity from 15 to 380 (jj, n=6; JJ, n=9; Jj, n=8) demonstrated identical slopes, energies of activation, (12.8 kcal/mol) and changes in slope at 35\u00b0C. We conclude that several factors related to membrane fluidity and lipid bilayer organization do not differ among microsomes from jj, JJ and Jj rats, indicating that an anomalous microsomal matrix does not explain the observed defect in conjugation of bilirubin in jj rats. Six infants presented from 3 wks to 3 mo of age with the symptom of bloody diarrhea, which had its onset at 1-4 wks. Dietary history revealed that all had been exclusively breast fed. Colitis was diagnosed by the presence of mucosal friability and focal ulceration of the rectosigmoid, limited to the distal 10 cm in 3. No infectious cause was identified. Biopsies obtained at proctosigmoidoscopy showed a range of findings from normal to low-grade, patchy active chronic inflanmatory bowel disease. No evidence of graft-vs-host disease or vasculitis was found. Breast milk, as the etiology of colitis, was investigated by substituting hydrolyzed casein or soy formula for at least 3 days; all had cessation of bleeding within 36 hours of halting breast feedings. Rechallenge with breast milk was done in 5 cases, the 6th mother refusing, and all had recurrence of bleeding within 36 hours. The possibility of dietary antigens being passed into breast milk and resulting in colitis in the infant was investigated by systematic elimination of certain antigens from the mothers' diets. Elimination of cow's milk prevented colitis in 2 while elimination of cow's milk, soy and egg did not prevent it in 3, the ubiquity of these latter antigens perhaps precluding complete elimination. Thus, we conclude breast feeding is occasionally the cause of colitis in infants. Although the possibility was not proved conclusively, it may be related to the presence of dietary antigens in the milk. Plasma lipoproteins from two female infants-Patient A, 19 months and Patient B, 4 weeks-were examined prior to and at one and four weeks after surgical repair of choledochal cyst, and the findings were correlated with hepatic morphology and standard indices of hepatic function. Prior to surgery, plasma cholesterol, phospholipid and triglyceride were elevated; cholesterol esters (CE) were low, 25 and 33% of total; HDL cholesterol and apo A-I, the major protein constituent of HDL, were subnormal; most of plasma lipids were contained in the LDL density region; LP-X was found in l.049<d<l.064. Patient A had had a relatively brief obstruction and suffered little secondary hepatic injury: one week after surgery, lipid concentrations returned to normal; apo A-I increased in HDL and a concomitant rise of CE to near normal, 65%, was observed; lipids were contained predominantly in HDL; hepatic function improved markedly. Patient B had had intrauterine obstruction and suffered cirrhosis: one week after surgery, lipid concentrations, CE, LDL lipid predominance and hepatic function remained essentially unchanged; in contrast, a many fold increase in HDL apo A-I was observed: one month after surgery, lipoproteins and hepatic function were near normal. In conclusion, children with biliary obstruction have lipoprotein abnormalities similar to those seen in adult patients and rapidly reversible with surgical relief. Recovery of HDL apo A-I precedes recovery of hepatic function and other lipoprotein abnormalities in children with secondary biliary cirrhosis.",

The simplest tests, barium swallow and nuclear medicine scan, may be adequate in this group. 3. These children have a very high incidence of esophagitis. 4. Medical treatment is difficult. Two different isotc;\u00b0pes are used simultaneously in each study to measure Ca kinetics by determining time dependent changes in Ca isotope ratios for each tracer relative to a third isotope at natural levels. Measurements are made on aliquots of Jiet, plasma, urine and feces. Physiological rates of absorption, urinary and fecal excretion, as well as bone deposition and resorption are calculated from the kinetic data. Results of studies with a subject with dystrophic calcification (A), a patient with osteogeni8is imperfecta (B) and a normal neonate (C) are reported here as fractions of total Ca turnover (g/kg.day). There were no observable differences between the rates of dietary absorption and bone resorption as functions of turnover for subjects A,B, and C. The values for urinary (vu) and endogenous fecal (vf) excretion and bone deposition (v 0 +) showed marked differences as functions of turnover: In contrast to the relative inactivity in utero, after birth the SI becomes highly active in absorbing dietary nutrients. The adaptation of BF during this period has not been studied. We evaluated growth and BF of SI in the perinatal period from difference in weight and BF of fetal (120-140 gestation) and (5-32 day old) lambs proximal jejunum (J) and distal ileum (Il). BF was determined from amount of radioactive labelled microspheres (12-15 \u00b5M), injected into the left ventricle, trapped in the microcirculation of SI. Portions of J and Il 18 cm long, were flushed with 150 mM NaCl solution and air and weighed. In alternating 3 cm long segments weight and radioactivity were determined in full thickness wall (W) 4. 54 1.45 As expected, both weight and BF of SI increased in the neonatal period. However, while in .I weight of M increased 1.5 fold, BF increased 3.5 fold, in 11 both weight of Mand BF increased 2.5 fold. The true significance of the discrepancy in increased weight and BF between J and Il in the neonatal period is unknown, but could be related to differences in functional properties of J and Il. In SBR growth of the remnant intestine is enhanced. We evaluated the effect of route and type of nutrition on growth of the St, Ce and Co in rats with >85% SBR. After surgery rats (140-170 g) were nourished orally ad libitum with a regular laboratory rat chow (Ch), or Flexical (Fl) or by vein with Travenol (T) along or in combination with oral Ch or Fl. A group of sham operated ( C) rats were treated as the SBR rats. Growth was assessed as difference in weight and weight/body weight ratio of the organs between C and SBR rats, 8 days after operation. At the time of study organs were weighed free of contents. The change in body weight (6, g) and organ weight ( Familial hypercholesterolemia (FHC) is associated with severe premature coronary artery disease, death, and is resistant to conventi0nal dietary treatment. Locust Bean Gum (LBG) iu food products was fed to children and adults with familial hypercholesterolemia. Twenty-eight children and adults (20 FHC, 8 N) were divided into two groups, using a cross-over design, and fed identical food products with and without LBG (8-30 gm/d) as outpatients in four-week periods. Diet records, food consumption, lipids, and lipoproteins were analyzed every two weeks. Total cholesterol was lowered 11% (m 275 to m 246) in Group A at four weeks and 16% (m 255 to 111 215) in Group B at six weeks (p < . 01). The difference in cholesterol between the LBG and control diet was 19% at four weeks (p< .01). l.01< -density lipoprotein (Ln!.) fell 10% at four weeks in Group .\\ and 20', at six weeks in Group B. IIDL/LDL ratios increased. LBG food acceptance was good. There were no significant side effects of the diet. LBG was more effective than several pharmacological agents in lowering serum lipids, and, in outpatieats, appears to be one of the most effective dietary treatments of FllC. LBG in food products appears to be (; safe, effective means of lowerinP, serum lipids in normal and hypercholesterolemic children and auults in HIC-type families. ",

In general, working in a NICU was rated moderately to extremely stressful (score 3.96 out of 5). 12 house officers (28%) rated it extremely stressful, while only 2 rated it mildly stressful. Of the 5 major areas, the most stress ful was the working hours (score 4.02); the most stressful items in this area were working the day after being on night call and working long hours on call (4.49). The second most stressful area was interaction with families (3.52), especially talking with parents of dead or dying infants (4.34) and dealing with parent's anger (4.04) . Items related to staff interactions generally were not stressful (2.54) though interacting with uncooperative nurses was among the most stressful items (4.38). House officers off work hours were also affected; the most common effect was inability to sleep normally on nights off-call (83%) and effects on mood (74%). Sex, residency level or marital status did not influence the stress level but medical school experience in neonatology and relevance to career plans were associated with a lower stress level. These data indicate that working in a NICU is extremely stressful for a significant proportion of house of ficers and that certain areas can be isolated as highly stressful.",

With implementation of a \"core\" curriculum planned and delivered by a nutritionist the PH's nutrition knowledge significantly improved. To prevent breast complications in the first days ofter delivery, many maternity units advise mothers to limit the frequency and duration of nursings. To investigate the effects of the frequency and duration of feedings on nipple soreness and breast engorgement we studied 2 groups of mother-infant pairs in the first 10 post-partum days. Allocation to the groups was determined by the day of delivery. All mothers recorded daily the frequency and duration of eaci1 feeding, nipple soreness and breast engorgement. We measured milk output and infant weight gain on the 15th day. lnfant and maternal characteristics were not significantly differ-enc between the groups. Mothers in the low frequency group (n=12) nursed on a routine 3-4 hours schedule while those in the high frequency group (n=lS) were encouraged to feed frequently. A competency-based didactic program in interviewing was developed to improve communication skills of pediatric housestaff. The program, implemented in a continuity clinic, began with a videotape of PLl's and 3's in a first visit, well-baby exam. PLl's were then given a series of didactic presentations on communication skills and feedback on their videotape performance and then videotaped for follow-up measure. PL3's were used as a measure of the skills acquired in the \"pediatric system,\" Comparisons were made between PLl pre's and PL3 controls (C), 1-pre's and 1-post's, and 1-post's anrl C's. Comparisons were made on the basis of a 17-item interview scale developed in the clinic. It appears there is an acquisition during residency of interviewing skills that are deficient on entry. However, though C's outperformed 1-pre's on 12 of 17 items, the difference being significant on 4 items (p's ranging from .001-.003),they were deficit in 6 areas. 1-pre's equaled or outperfonned C's on 5 items, significantly on l (p=.Ol). Implementation of the teaching/feedback (T/F) had 2 major effects. PLl's improved their skills in 13 areas, significantly in 3 (p's from .005-.02), being deficit on follow-up in only 4 areas. However, skills in 2 areas which had been relatively low on entry deteriorated almost to the even lower C level, despite teaching. Comparison of 1-post's and C's indicated that T/F resulted in substantial equivalence between the 2 groups, with no significant differences. These findings indicate that although residency training improves communication skills over entry, sig. deficits remain and that l's can exceed the 3 level with intervention.",

No cultures were falsely reported as positive by the residents. We conclude that residents can reliably interpret throat cultures and maintain this reliability when unsupervised.",

Concern over the frequency of chloramphenicol use prompted a review of its use. Fifty-five of 1000 children admitted to the hospital received chloramphenicol for 1-17 days (median 2 days). They ranged in age from 1 month to 15 years (median 5 months). Chloramphenicol was administered by the intravenous route in doses from 50-100 mg/kg/d. Chloramphenicol was begun in combination with a penicillin as empiric therapy in children being evalL\u2022ated for sepsis, meningitis, cellulitis, pneumonia, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, and abscess. The initial diagnoses were substantiated in 31; H. influenzae type b was the etiology in only 4. A large number of children had documented viral diseases. Chloramphenicol toxicity was most often monitored with serial CBCs, rarely with reticulocyte counts or serum concentrations of chloramphenicol. These data demonstrate that chloramphenicol was used excessively as empiric therapy, although it was administered by the correct route, in appropriate doses, and for appropriate periods. Monitoring of toxicity appeared inadequate. These findings were presented to the medical staff in order to improve the pattern of chloramphenicol use. SICKLE CELL SCREENING OF NEWBORNS.

All those diagnosed to have sickle cell disease were given a specific appointment to a sickle cell clinic or other health agency for comprehensive medical care. Follow-up data is currently being collected re. the morbidity and mortality among these patients. In addition 7,039 identified with sickle cell trait (AS), 1,921 AC and 12 ACH r . Of 6,830 families who were notified of the trait (AS and AC) diagnosis in their infants and were invited for testing and counseling, 2,875 (42%) were tested and counseled during the study period. These fiqures have improved remarkably during the year 1981 because of the active oarticipation of the Testing of the families also identified 26 parents with the diagnosis of sickle cell disease (6 SS, 20 SC) and one with S/HPFH.

We have developed a program on our pediatric ward in which parents are encouraged to \"room in\" and participate in the care of a hospitalized child. The parent of any child may participate in the program, regardless of the child's diagnosis or acuity. Staffing of the unit is based on acuity and is not modified by parent involvement in the program. A 5-item Likert-type questionnaire was developed to survey the effects of the program as perceived by medical and nursing staff. Although the nursing staff constantly interfaces with parents in the program and might be expected to have sharper criticisms of it, we found no significant differences between their responses and those of the medical staff. Eighty-seven percent of the staff felt that the program made their jobs easier; 7% felt that it made their jobs more difficult; 63% felt that the program improved their efficiency, while 13% felt it decreased efficiency; 33% thought the program decreased patient care errors while 11% thought it increased errors. Ninety-two percent felt that the time they spent with parents was satisfying while 8% found it frustrating. One-hundred ",

For both girls and boys, slang or ethnic words were generally used, regardless of race or education. In contrast to a previous sample of highly educated mothers who regretted not learning words for female genitalia until adolescence or adulthood, mothers in this representative sample were embarasse<l and seemed at a loss to explain whether their terms referred to the vagina or organs. Pediatricians could easily use specific labels during the genital examination of the young child, thus educating both parents and child and ing that sex is not a taboo subject. To determine if common sleep problems, readily ascertainable by pediatric professionals, are associated with other disturbances in young children and their families, a sample of 50 healthy children under 4 years of age was enrolled in an interview study on the basis of well-child care appointments in representative facilities. A sleep problem in a child 6 months of age or older was defined as bedtime struggles or night waking which involved the parents three or more nights each week for the month preceding the interview. By this definition, 31% had a sleep problem, of concern to the mother in each case. Of these, only one had a bedtime problem without night waking and the majority had both. Sleep problem children did not differ in demographic characteristics from non-sleep disturbed children, but were more likely to have parents who responded to night waking by bringing the child into the parental bed (p=0.03) or with other forms of body contact (p=0.02). Mothers of sleep-problem children were significantly less accepting (p=0.02) and reported more severe stresses (p=0.002), especially associated with family illness or accidents, sibling births, overnight and unaccustomed daytime separation from the mother, and depressed maternal mood. However, few pediatricians discussed sleep after a child's early months of life. Thus, night waking seemed to be an easily quantifiable behavior which should alert professionals to the existence of more pervasive disturbances in child and family. The pediatrician makes a judgment of degree of illness(Toxicity)of a febrile child based on observation prior to history(Hx) and physical exam(PE). In order to define valid and reliable observation data for that .Judgment, data from 2 previous studies were used to construct 3 point scales of 14 observation items correlated with serious illness(SI) in those reports. Between 11/1/80 and 3/1/81, these 14 scaled items were scored simultaneously by attendings, residents and nurses prior to Hx and PE on 312 febrile children <24 months seen consecutively in our Primary Care Center and one private practice; 37 had SI. Multiple regression analysis based on patients seen by at least 1 attending revealed 7 items(Quality of Cry, Reaction to Parents, Color, State Variation, Hydration, Eye Appearance, Respiratory Pattern) were significant and independent predictors of SI(Multiple R\u2022 0.64). Interobserver levels for scoring these 7 items between 1 attending pair who saw 1/3 of the patients were, with one exception, clinically By discriminate function analysis, these 7 items had, when used together, a specificity of 867. and a sensitivity of 747. for SI. Only 2.1% of patients with a score of <0.10 from discriminate function analysis had SI; 91% with a score of >0.50 had SI. The sensitivity of these 7 items for SI when combined with Hx and PE was 89%. This 7 item model, when used prior to Hx and PE is reliable, predictive, specific and sensitive for SI in febrile children.",

Behavioral knowledge was tested by 60 multiple-:hoice questions. ANOV As evaluated amount of change, revealing that \u00b7irtually all significant effects related to program type occurred in the 'L-2 year.

They ranged in age from 4 to 72 months (mean age 21.7 months); 9 6 months of age. At the time of myringotomy, 58 children (82%) had been receiving, or had recently completed therapy 3 days), with either ampicillin or amoxicillin. Cultures from all 71 children were plated on chocolate agar with bacitracin. A 10 \u00b5g ampicillin disc was placed on the streaked primary plate to select presumptive AmpR Hemophilus which grew near the disc. s-lactamase determination was done on all isolates. AmpR H.flu was recovered from all 71 children. Seven children (7/71) had myringotomy performed both before ampicillin therapy and on persistence of AOM. All 7 initially had H. influenzae sensitive to ampicillin recovered from the middle ter ampicillin treatment, when persistent AOM was diagnosed, AmpR H.flu was recovered from the middle ears of all 7. Antimicrobial therapy for persistent AOM included erythro/sulfa (38), TMP-SMZ (17), ceclor (13), and other (3). There was no apparent therapeutic superiority of one modality over the others as determined by the persistence of AOM. Simultaneous semi-quantitative throat cultures (TC) and nasopharyngeal cultures (NP) were obtained from 152 children. Sixtyfive were well with no recent exposure to antibiotic; 51 had purulent nasopharyngitis; 36 were seen at 10-day follow-up after ampicillin treatment of acute otitis media.

TGD presented with bi 1 ious vomiting at <12 hours in 1 NB. between 12-24 hours in 9, between 24-48 hours in 2, and between 48-72 hours in 2. All 14 NB with TGD oassed meconium within 24 hours of birth; 3 had a meconium plug. Abdominal x-rays showed generalized distended bowel loops in 10 and normal gas pattern in 4. Eleven NB with TGD had normal contrast studies; the remaining 3 improved before contrast studies could be done. Eleven NB with TGD had negative septic work-ups; the other 3 were not cllnically septic and were not treated with antibiotics. Metabolic studies were normal except for 1 NB with hypocalcemia and 1 with hyponatremia. None of the mothers were given MgS04; 2 had demerol. One NB had fetal distress, 1 had a 1 min Apgar <3, and none were meconium stained. NB with TGD tolerated nipple feeding at a mean+S.D. of 4.3+1.5 days (range 2-6 days) and on clinical follow up had no subsequent GI Although bile-stained vomitus is thought to be uniformly an ominous sign, it is not invariably associated with surgical problems in the NB. Our data indicates that 82% of NB with bilious vomiting in the first 3 days of life had TGD; however, appropriate work-up is still necessary to insure early diagnosis of potential surgical lesions. The assumption that clinical diagnoses provide substantial information regarding the sequelae and treatment of chronic physical illness is based on the belief that great similarity exists among children with a particular diagnostic label. This hypothesis was tested using data collected at enrollment in a study of 209 children with diverse chronic physical illness. Data were analyzed on the child's functional status, impact of chronic illness on the family, child's and mother's psychologicRl adjust- Data comparing feeding and stooling patterns of breast-fed and formula-fed infants are not readily available in the literature. To provide such data, mothers of healthy, full-term infants (30 breast-fed, 12 bottle-fed) maintained diaries, recording each feeding and each episode of spitting and vomiting. Each stool was to be recorded, and the type of stool (formed, pasty, mucus or liquid) was to be noted. Diaries were maintained from nursery discharge to l month examination. (Statistical analysis was by Student's t-test or Fisher exact test. twotailed significance level.) Formula-fed infants were found to have fewer stools/day (2.5+1 .5 vs. 3.5+1 .4, p<.05) and their stools were usually either-pasty (62.5%) or firm (25.5%). Although 50.9% of the breast-fed infants' stools were described as liquid, nearly the same proportion (443) were described as pasty. The consistency of stools was more variable for formulafed infants than for breast-fed infants. Three or four different stool types were reported for 75% of the formula-fed infants while only 16% of breast-fed infants had more than 2 different stool types. (p<.001). Formula-fed infants were more 1 ikely to vomit (58% vs. 13% breast-fed, p<.01) and to experience greater number of episodes of vomiting/day. ( .199+.14 vs . . 113+.05, p<.05).

Patients with glycogenosis lb exhibit an increased incidence of infections and bleeding. Further studies of neutrophils and platelets from these patients will increase our understanding of the metabolic basis for function of these cells in host defense and hemostasis. We have found a correlation between specific mutations and haplotypes obtained from seven polymorphic restriction sites in the p\u00b7globin gene cluster. Seven different mutations have been identified among 45 Italian ,6-thal genes; 6 of these were found among 42 Greek genes. An 8th mutation was found among 4 Turkish genes, and probably 4 new genes were present among 29 Asian Indian genes. Of the 120 genes 22 (18%) could be detected directly because either a) the mutation altered a restriction site [Hphl (8), Rsal (5), and Avril (l)}b) the mutation is a deletion (8). The mutation has been identified by DNA sequencing or restriction analysis in 35/122 (29%) of genes studied. The high correlation between specific polymorphism haplotypes and mutations allows estimation of the frequency of genetic compounds in affected individuals. Genetic compounds comprise about 85% of Italians and 50% of Greeks and Asian Indians with In our sample of 66 affected individuals there are 29 combinations of genes producing the disease. These data indicate that genetic heterogeneity is prevalent in leading to a high frequency of genetic compounds in affected individuals, and that prenatal diagnosis of j:!>-thal will usually rely upon linkage analysis of polymorphic restriction sites rather than direct detection of the mutations involved. We have prepared a cDNA library from poly(A)+RNA derived from human liver obtained at surgery. The cDNA was inserted into the PstI site of pBR322 using GC tailing. Recomhinants were screened using plasmid selection of mRNA isolated from human or baboon liver, followed by in vitro translation, immunoprecipitation and analysis by SOS gel electrophoresis. As many as 10 recombinants were screened on a sinqle DBM filter disk, and as many as 10 antisera were pooled at the immunoprecipitation step, so that a single lane on sos gel analysis could represent up to 100 tests. Positive signals were retested with individual recombinants and antibodies to identify each specific cONA. Studies to date have included antibodies against argininosuccinate synthetase, argininosuccinate lyase, arginase, a 1 -antitrypsin, albumin, antichymotrypsin, n 2 -HS-glycoprotein, antithrombin III, gC-qlobulin and apolipoproteins A-I, B and E.

The release of sialic acid fran all four gangliosides was reduced in the patients fibroblasts (9-34% of control activity) and intermediate levels were found in cells fran the obligate heterozygotes (56-74% of control activity). However, the activity in the patients fibroblasts toward \u21221 and GD:J.a gangliosides which contain only sialic acid linked to galactose was !IDre depressed than the activity toward GDJ.b and Gr1 gangliosides which contain an additional linkage of sialic acid to sialic acid. Analysis of the reaction products of cell preparations incubated with the various substrates have shown that control fibroblasts catabolized GT1 ganglioside mainly via GDJ.b ganglioside, presunably by cleaving first a sialic acid-galactose linkage. In contrast, cell preparations fran patients with ML IV converted GI'1 ganglioside !IDStly into GD:J.a ganglioside by cleavage of a sialic acid-sialic acid linkage. The apparent Kai values for neuraminidase activities toward Cl11 and GD:J. gangliosides were found to be 15-20 times higher in ML IV as canpared to those of controls. ML IV appears to be a ganglioside sialidosis due to catalytically defective, sialic acid-galactose specific, ganglioside neuraminidase.",

'\"he Hay-Genetics Center. Depts. of Peds. and Path. New Orleans. We recently described the purification of a glycopeptide with molecular weight of approximately5000 from sera of controls and CF patients. Both appeared to be very similar structurally. The purified glycopeptide from CF patients showed marked ciliary dyskinetic activity, whereas its \"normal counterpart\" had no apparent biological activity on rabbit tracheal explants. (PecJiat. Res 16, March, 1982) . In the present study the immunogenic and antigenic properties of the CF glycopeptide and its normal counterpart were compared. BALB/c mice were immunized with one of the glycopeptides and their spleen cells fused with X63NS1/l-Ag-4 (N:O ,) \"'ouce myeloma cells. Six hvbridi zation experiments ( 3 with each glycopeptide) were in which different plating methods and screening assays were evaluated. Although an identical immun\u00b7\u00b7 ization procedure was used, 53 hybridoma cultures producing specific antibodies to the control glycopeptide and only 11 producing anti bodies to the CF glycopeptide were obtained. The anti bodies from these cloned hybridomas were used to compare serum fractions from controls and CF patients (10 samples in each group). Indistinguishable immunological reactivity (antigenicity) between the controls and CF patients was demonstrated. These findings indicate that, although the CF glycopeptide and its normal counterpart differed markedly in their ciliary dyskinetic activity and in their immunogenicity, they revealed both structural and antigenic similarity. The genes for two enzymes involved in separate steps in the purine biosynthetic pathway are on chromosome 21, although the locus of the genes is not fully defined. Cytogenetic and biochemical studies on a family with an unusual translocation of chromosome 21 have provided further information on localization of the GARS locus on chromosome 21. The proband was referred for chromosome analysis to confirm the diagnosis of Down syndrome and was found to have one normal chromosome 21 and a structurally abnormal sub-metacentric chromosome interpreted as a t(21;21) non-Rubertsonian translocation, resulting in partial trisomy of chromosome 2lq. She was also mosaic for a minute dot-like marker. Cytogenetic studies on the phenotypically normal mother and sibling revealed 47 with a small supernumerary bisatellited marker chromosome in addition to the normal karyotype. Cell free extracts from sonicated fibroblasts cultured from the proband and her mother were assayed for GARS activity. The proband' s cells had approximately twice the activity of the mother's cells, a result consistent with a gene dosage effect. These results provide evidence that the locus of GARS is closely linked to the genes required for the expression of nown syndrome and is on the segment of the long arm of chromosome 21 which is trisomic in this patient. Three patients with PL have been evaluated and one of them also had MPGN associated with a 46,XX,del S (p21) chromosome constitution.",

We have produced nine trisomy 16 +--+ diploid chimeras: five of these Tsl6 chimeras were in a group of fetuses sacrificed at 18 days of gestation and four were liveborn. All of the analyzed organs from the Tsl6 chimeras, including brain, liver, muscle, kidney, lung, heart, thymus, blood and bone marrow, contained Tsl6 and 2n cells. The proportion of Tsl6 cells in each organ, as estimated from coat color, enzyme markers, and/or karyotype, ranged from 5-70%, most commonly 20-40%. Of the liveborn Tsl6 chimeras, the oldest of which is now 6 months old, two appeared normal, one had unilateral anopthalmos, and one was severely growth retarded.

The translocated material from the number 4 was inserted into the lp36.l band (46,XX,dir lp36.1::4pter+4pl2::lp36.l+ lqter; 4pl2-t4qter-,). Her two affected children had unbalanced karyotypes due to inheritance of the abnormal maternal number 1 and the normal maternal number 4. They are effectively trisomic for the segment 4pl2 to 4pter.",

The DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) is characterized by parathyroid and thymic hypoplasia/aplasia and cardiac conotruncus or great vessel malformations, usually in patients with mild facial dys-'\u00b7orphia. In three of fourteen patients with DGS whom we have karyotyped (six with banding) over fifteen years. we have found identical deletions of the short and proximal long arms of chromosome 22 (22pter-qll). The remaining long arm material of chromosome 22 was translocated to a different autosome in each with break points !Oq26, 3qter, and 20qll. All had classic DGS and few other anomalies despite being, respectively, partial monosomy lOq, partial monosomy 3q, and partial trisontt 20p, in addition to partial monosomy for 22. The chromosome 22 deletion in our patients appears to be identical to that reported by de la Chapelle et al. (Hum Gen 57:253, 1981) in four children with DGS in one family. Several other reported patients with partial or full monosomy for chromosome 22 have had incomplete forms of DGS. To our knowledge, no patient with complete DGS has had a chromosome rearrangement not involving chromosome 22.",

To date, 23 affected individuals, whose ages range from 14 months to 80 years, have been identified. Seven affected individuals were examined in detail and they and their families interviewed. Without exception, they were all raised as females until puberty. All post-puberty affected individuals virilized, had a male distribution of body hair and heavy beard, and a urogenital sinus with enlarged phallus. None had gynecomastia. Puberty was traumatic for all, behavior in school was frequently aggressive and school was often discontinued. Although this disease and its course was recognized and well known within the extended family over several generations, nevertheless, all newborn affected members continued to be raised as females. A few individuals in generations V and VI, on their own initiative and without psychiatric evaluation or help, changed gender role as young adults. Two such patients will be discussed in detail. The inheritance is most compatible with During the subsequent pregnancy of the mother, at 23 weeks gestation a fctoscopy with fetal skin biopsy was performed. Prominent stratum granulosum and orthokeratotic strntum spinosum with densely packed keratin suggested a hyperkeratotic state in the fetus. This was interpreted as i:.dicating Sjogren-Larsson syndrome. The parents decided to have the child. At 34 weeks gestation a liveborn female with congenital ichthyosis but no other major abnormalities was delivered. No scars were present at the sites of the biopsy. Thus, Sjogren-Larsson syndrome became a condition for which prenatal diagnosis is possible. ",

            "text": "The etiology and pathogenesis of the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), characterized by perinatal hypotonia, developmental delay, obesity, and hypogonadism, remain obscure. In recent years, reports of various chromosome abnormalities, including an interstitial deletion of 15q in patients with PWS suggests a chromosomal basis for the disorder. However, the demonstration of a normal karyotype in a substantial proportion of PWS patients suggests etiologic heterogeneity, and possible variability in the clinical, biochemical and epidemiologic correlates of the disorder. Review of parental ages of patients with PWS seen in our clinic (n=ll) and reported in the literature (n=34) compared with age and sex-matched controls reveals a significant increase in mean parental age at the time of birth of PWS patients (PWS: maternal age 31. 5 .:!: 6. 7 years, paternal age 35. 2 .:!: 6. 9 years. Controls: maternal age 27. 8 .:!: 7. 4 years and paternal age 28. 3 .:!: 5. 5 years). A plot of parental ages of all PWS patients suggests a bimodal distribution, with maternal and paternal age peaks of 26 and 34 and 30 and 38 years respectively, Parental age distribution of PWS patients with a chromosome aberration is shifted to older ages with only a single peak. Etiologic and genetic heterogeneity may account for the inconsistent finding of advanced parental age in PWS in previous reports. (!Omg/kg IV) reduced plasma phe from 1.0 to 0.27mM in 3 hr. and 0.40mM at 18 hr. Gastric administration of 6MPH4 (20-38mg/kg/day) was also effective: after 11 days of unrestricted diet, plasma phe was 0.19mM. On the 11th day of this study, the 6MPH4 level in CSF (60.Sng/ml) was similar to the patient's CSF neopterin level (48ng/ml) higher than the biopterin level of adult controls (18.6\u00b112.7ng/ml,n=5) and the patient (0.59-0.8lng/ml). 6MPH4 did not increase CSF or plasma catecholamines or NT metabolites. NT synthesis in the patient was stimulated by 6MPH4, however, since increases were detected in urinary homovanillic acid (from 14 and 50 to 138 and 314\u00b5g/24 hr.), 5-hydroxyindolacctic acid (58, 64 to 100, 226pg/24 hr.) and dopamine (209, 216, 236 to 315, 346 \u00b5g/gm creatinine). These results indicate that 6MPH 4 (!)effectively controls the hyperphcnylalaninemia of BSD (2) crosses the This study involved 8 weeks of intensive PETs in order to increase the iduronosulfate sulfatase (IS) level to no less than 35% the normal IS activity. Four patients with Hunter's syndrome were Liven PETs. The volume of plasma infused at each PET was 50-55 ml per kg. IS activity on the donor's and patient's plasma was performed using tritium labeled disulfated disaccharide prepared following the degradation of heparin by nitrous acid. It was found that 2 PETs were needed per week. The average rise in IS activity following PET was 83.8% (\u00b1 10.4) and activity dropped to 43.8% (\u00b1 4.0) of normal prior to the next PET. After 8 weeks of PETs, liver and spleen sizes decreased on all patients, as determined by radionuclide studies. Urinary mucopolysaccharides (MPS) dropped in 1 child from 0.24 to 0.08 mg/mg creatinine but there was no significant change in the other 3 children. Liver biopsy in 2 children before and after PET indicated no significant change in MPS despite a slight increase in IS activity in 1 child following PET. These data suggest that PETs in Hunter's syndrome if performed frequently will sustain an adequate plasma IS level. Although reduced acid 13-glucosidase activity (13-glu) appears to be the primary enzyme defect in Type I Gaucher disease (GD), previous studies have shown marked elevation of serum acid phosphatase (AP) in GD. We have observed striking changes in the activity and isozyme distribution of serum 13-hexosaminidase (hex) In GD, and carrier testing for Tay-Sachs disease may offer a useful approach for the presumptive diagnosis of GD. Mendelian genetic disorders may not be recognizable at birth or even early in life, despite the presumed inborn nature of the defect. Non-recognition may result fr001 lack of an appropriate identifying characteristic or fr001 lack of gene expression at that time. Hhen a biochemical marker is identified, however, the phenotype is usually found to be congenital.",

Mcnkes' kinky hair syndrome is an X-linked disorder of copper (Cu) transport and utilization. An animal model is provided by the blotchy (blo) mouse, mutant at the X-linkcd mottled locus. Since the defect may reside in abnormal regulation of metallothionein or of its function, we studied the metabolism of Cu, zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd) in fibroblasts of the blo mouse. Mutant cells rapidly accumulate added 64 cu to a level 10-fold higher than normal. While the kinctcs of 6 4 cu uptake are equivalent in mutants and controls, efflux of Cu in mutant cells is impaired. In con\u00b7trast, the kinetics of 65 zn and 109cd accumulation are not distinguishible in normal and mutant. 6 4 cu accumulation was measured in cells exposed to Cd and Zn. In controls the.)\u00b7c was a 2-3 fold increase in 64 cu accumulation in the presence of Cd, while mutant cells showed no change over baseline mutant levels. A similar qualitative difference was seen between control and mutant cells upon exposure to Zn. Exposure of both cell types to Cd effected no change in 65zn accumulation. We conclude that the defect in blo cells affects specifically the function of a Cu storage or transport protein, with the metabolism of Zn and Cd unaffected. The differential response nf normal and control cells tn induc-C'rs of metallothionein may be secondary to aberrant function of that specific Cu storage or transport protein, or may reflect altered regulation of a specific Cu thioncin.

Sph, Chol, Sphase (uns/mg prot/hr), and the rates of formation of Sph and Chol (pmoles/mg prot/hr) were measured in skin fibroblasts (Fibs) from 27 of these patients: A(l3); B(7); C(7). Sphase is deficient in NPD-A and B, but not in NPD-C. 107\u00b134 67\u00b132 of Sph and Chol is much less in NPD-C than in A or B. Although, for the group, Sphase is not significantly deficient in NPD-C Fibs or Livs (p=0.45; 0.49), three patients had low Sphase in Fibs (34, 42, and 51% of normal) and two had low activity in Liv (28 and 47% of normal). In these patients, there was no correlation between Sph or Chol content and Sphase. The rates of formation of Sph and Chol are normal in NPD-C. Classifying patients with modestly depressed Sphase activity as NPD-C is of questionable value; the key to phenotypina an infant remains the clinical course of an affected sibling.

J::ue to dysmorphic features, chromosome analysis was carried out on peripheral blood lymphocyte culture which revealed a karyotype of 46,XX,22q+. M:>ther's karyotype was 46,XX.

On her last examination, at age 22 months, she was below 5th percentile for weight (8.0 kg), length (68 cm) and head circumference (42.S cm). Other findings were plagiocephaly, ptosis of left eye with antimongoloid slant, hypertelorism, epicanthal folds, beaked nose, low set and malfonned ears, hypoplastic philtrum, thin lips, small mouth, high arched palate, right simian crease, bilateral clinodactyly and slight puffyness of feet.

Altered biotin metabolism produces a common clinical presentation including ataxia, alopecia, keratitis and dermatitis. Three separate etiologies are known: 1. A genetic deficiency of biotin holocarboxylase synthetase (BHS). 2. An apparent defect in biotin absorption or transport. 3. Dietary biotin deficiency. Distinguishing groups 2 and 3 from l requires measurement of plasma and urinary biotin. The only current method sensitive enough to measure physiologic biotin concentrations requires a bioassay not widely available. We have developed an isotope-dilution assay for biotin utilizing avidin to bind 3 (H)-biotin, and nitrocellulose filters to separate bound from free of urine or plasma ultrafiltrate are mixed with 10\u2022 of (H)-biotin (0.41 pmol; 36.4 Ci/mmol), and 30\u2022 of an avidin solution (4 pmol/ml). The tubes are mixed and 225\u2022 of the mixture are then vacuum aspirated through nitrocellulose filters, followed by a 0.6 ml wash of 0.01 M NaAcetate buffer, pH 5.0. The filters are dried and the bound radioactivity determined in a liquid scintillation counter. Known biotin standards prepared in 150 mm NaCl are run simultaneously. A semilog plot of 3 radioactivity bound versus biotin concentration is linear over the range of 50 to 750 pg biotin. Usirg this method, the mean urinary biotin excretion for 19 neonates was 118 76 ng/ml creatinine.This agrees with the ?Ublished range of urinary biotin excretion via the bioassay (4.3 to 95 ng/ mg creatinine). Normal plasma biotin concentration by this method was 300-750 pg/ml (bioassay = 200-SOO).",

Families of 5 dental hypophosphatasia (DH) propositi (premature loss of deciduous teeth) were compared to maternal and paternal families of a case of lethal, infantile hypophosphatasia (IH). By criteria of low serum alkaline phosphatase (AP) and elevated urinary phosphoethanolamine (PEA), autosomal inheritance was construed in all 7 pedigrees. The gene appears to reduce by 50-70% the basal AP level. A wide normal range of this basal level, however, renders individual carrier screening, out of family context, uninterpretable. In DH families, penetrance for premature loss of deciduous teeth is low. The non-carrier parent of all DH sibships has \"low normal\" AP, suggesting that penetrance depends on interaction of the DH gene with familial AP levels. As expected, there were no IH cases seen in the DH pedigrees; however, in each IH line, an individual with dental symptoms was ascertained. Acrylamide gel electrophoresis and selective inhibition by amino acids and urea indicate a reduction of bone and liver isoenzymes in some members of each family. No anomalous bands of activity were seen. Electrophoretically isolated serum isoenzymes have to date revealed no kinetic differences between normal, IH carrier, and DH residual activity.",

Eighteen rea were familial, five de nova, and one undetermined; one subject carried a familial and a de nova rep. The familial cases had r.ormal outcomes. Two de novo were normal, one abnormal, and two were aborted. The advent of high resolution chromosome banding has allowed the discovery of a growing number of subtle but complex chromosomal rearrangements. We here report a child who has both a short arm deletion and a pericentric inversion in one chromosome number 3. This abnormal chromosome arose from a recombinational event in maternal gonadal cells. Recombination occurred between one chromosome 3 which displayed a double pericentric inversion and its normal homologue. The double inversion in chromosome 3 was present in the mosaic state with approximately one-half of the peripheral lymphocytes exhibiting a normal karyotype. The phenotype of the proband is generally consistent with previous reports of duplication-deficiency syndrome of the short arm of chromosome 3, namely, mental retardation, microcephaly, unusual facies and small size. This child has frank seizures of petit mal status with left focal origin and has developed bruxism as well as self-stimulating behavior. The proband's karyotype is designated as 46 ,XX, -3, +rec( 3) ( qter+q29:: p25+p 13: :ql l+pl 3:: qll-\u2022 qter)mat.

The observation of a mosaic double inversion is, in itself, an unusual finding. The involvement of such a chromosome in a recombination event is truly unique. The best current test for PKU carrier status is the ratio of p2/T where P is plasma phenylalanine and T is plasma tyrosine after phenylalanine dose loading (reliability is claimed to -> 100% by some). The test is cumbersome requiring two venipunctures, and the phenylalanine dosing often produces nausea, dizzyness and occasionally syncopy. Therefore, in order to develop a more benign test 31 adult 11 controls\" (carrier status unknown) an<l 43 adult obligate PKU carriers were given a standard phenylalanine dose loading test and plasma levels of P, T, & the ratios P/T and p2/T were determined before and after dose loading. Of all parameters, the best discrimination between carriers and non-carriers was given by the formula (4.4053 x ln P)-(0.5221 x ln T) -0.6907 where ln is the natural log of fasting plasma P or T. In 92% of our subjects, this formula distinguished between \"controls\" and obligate carriers with 95% confidence. The test values for the remaining 8% of subjects fell in a \"grey\" area where their status could not be determined by this or any other of our parameters, singly or in combination. Among 31 \"controls\", two were classified as PKU carriers by all parameters we evaluated (a frequency compatible with chance). One additional \"control 11 subject classified as a carrier only by our formula could be a misclassification. Among 43 obligate carriers, 3 were classified as non-carriers by our formula, but all 3 carried a variant PKU gene. Our data suggest that ours is a relatively reliable but more benign test for carriers of the classical PKU gene-requiring only a single fasting blood specimen without phenylalanine dosing. We report an 18-year-old female with multiple exostoses, unusual facies, and developmental delay who has an interstitial deletion of Sq.

Three patients with exostoses, mental retardation, and deletions involving Sq have been described. The deleted segments in two patients 19SO; 19Sl) were similar-de! (S)(ql3-+ q22) and del (S)(q21), respectively. The deletion in the third patient (Eur J Pediatr 133:163-166, 19SO) was different-de! (S)(q24). The deletion in our patient is distinct from those previously reported in patients with exostoses. The similarities in phenotype associated with apparently different deletions of Sq raise the possibility of multiple loci on Sq which are involved in bone formation, the deletion of any of these being associated with similar abnormalities. Recently there has been increasing interest in the occurence of polycythemia and the hyperviscous state which alters blood flow in small vessels and results in sludging and impaired circulation to vital organs. Hematocrit (Hct) is the most important determinant of blood viscosity (Vis), in addition to temperature and shear rate. Other factors such as RSC deformability, platelet count and protein concentration (globulins, fibrinogen) are also important. Therefore hyperviscosity is better evaluated by actual measurement than by extrapolation from central Hct. The Sonoclot\u00ae (Sienco Instruments) is a new portable device for measuring viscosity and the kinetics of blood coagulation. The principle involves measurement of the mechanical impedance imposed on a rapidly vibrating probe (250 Hertz) irrmersed in whole blood maintained at 37 C. A fixed low shear rate (theoretically approximating zero) is used. 0.05 ml of blood (with or without anticoagulant) is required. 46 normal term infants-'48 hours old with a mean Hct (X \u00b1SD) of 55% \u00b1 6.3 (range 41-64%) were found to have a mean Vis (X \u00b1 SD) of 7.4 \u00b1 1.45 cenipoise (cps). 21 similar infants with X \u00b1SD of 69.5% \u00b1 3.6 had a mean Vis of 10.4 \u00b1 2.2 cps. Four infants with central Vis of) 11 cps were Rx with exchange transfusion. All had Hct}65%; three were symptomatic. This technique gives highly reproaucible, rapid results, which are consistent with other published data. It also provides a continous recording of the kinetics of blood coagulation and would appear to have considerable usefulness in the normal & intensive care nursery. Vascular changes following exposure to radiation include morphological alterations in the vessel intima, vasoconstriction, and the formation of vaso-occlusive thrombi leading to circulatory impairment and regional tissue hypoxia. Since vascular prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) is a potent and inhibitor of platelet aggregation, and platelet thromboxane Az is a vasoconstrictor and platelet aggregator, we evaluated the production of these 2 opposing compounds in control versus irradiated umbilical vascular rings and platelets. In 8 paired experiments following a single dose of 200 rads in vitro, umbilical arterial PGI2 production (as evaluated by bioassay) was markedly reduced in irradiated vessels (0.18+0.07 ng/mg; lSEM) when compared to paired normal controls (0.94+0.14; p<0.001). A concomitant decrease in 6 Keto PGF1a (the stable end product of vascular PGI2) was also observed in the irradiated vessels. However, irradiation had no effect on the production of platelet TXB2 (the stable metabolite of TXAz). In 7 experiments, mean values of TXB2 in platelets irradiated up to 2000 rads was 22.0+3.2% when compared to a mean of 21.3 +3% in paired nonirradiated (p>0.05). Myocardial infarction has been observed after conventional mediastinal irradiation. In the animal model radiation also acts synergistically with high cl1olesterol diets to produce severe atheromatous lesions. A decrease in vascular PGI2 without any concomitant change in platelet TXB2 may provide an explanation for some of the vascular complithat occur post irradiation. Measurements of the survival of RBC in hemolytic anemias of childhood are encumbered by a requirement for radioactive isotopes and/or by the inability to measure the o' populations of RBC simultaneously. Therefore, we have devised a method to overcome these oroblems which takes advantage of modern atomic absorption spectrophotometry. RSC of 5 rhesus monkeys were labeled with Bug/ml RBC of non-radioactive and with 0.01 ug/ml RBC of . These results show that is non-toxic to RBC and provides an excellent assay of RBC survival without a requirement for ragtoactivity. Only when dual population studies are required is Na2 Cr04 necessary. The double labeling procedure permits refined assays to be performed on cohorts of RBC which differ with respect to age,and susceptible to hemolysis, in a variety of clinical disorders. Complete remission was successfully induced in an 11 year old ANLL patient using low-dose ARA-C after failure of chemotherapy (CT) utilizing high doses of this agent. Initial CT consisted of two courses of ARA-C, Daunomycin, vincristine, and methylprednisolone; the> ARA-C was given by continuous IV infusion at a dose of 150-200mg/M 2 /day x 7 days for each course. A bone marrow aspirate (BMA) obtained 17 days after the second course of treatment contained essentially no normal hematopoietic precursors and >80% blast cells. Low-dose ARA-C 0.7mg/kg/day (20mg/M 2 /day) by continuous IV infusion was then begun. After 1 week, normal hemopoiel ic eel ls were increased and BMA blast count was reduced to 20%; after two weeks, the blast count was <5%. CT was stopped at this point because the patient was pancytopenic, a consequence of marked marrow megaloblastosis. Within one week, the megaloblastosis and pancytopcnia had resolved. Repeat BMA 6 weeks later remains in complete remission. A patient with myeloblastit.: transformation of chronic myelogenous leukemia has also shown a favorable response to low-dose ARA-C and is now back in chronic phase. Neither patient experienced nausea or vomiting; both were treated on an ambulatory basis. The rapid effect and relatively mild toxicity of low-dose ARA-C suggest a noncytotoxic mechanism of action consistent with experimental data demonstrating induction of maturation in ANLL <..\u00b7ells (Sa<..\u00b7hs, L.: Br.J.Haematol. 40:509, 1978). We have previously shown that PMNs from cord blood produce normal or increased amounts of superoxide anion but decreased amounts of \u00b7Oil compared to adult PMNs.

To detennine whether the decreased \u00b7OH production by newborn PMNs is related to abnonnalities of granule contents or their release, degranulation and the total content of MPO, lysozyme (LYSO) and LF, as well as \u00b7OH production, were measured. Release of LYSO Significant alterations in hematologic function in cystic fibrosis were suggested by the observation that polycythemia was uncorrmon even among cyanotic patients. To elucidate those factors which influence hematologic equilibrium, 39 stable cystic fibrosis patients were evaluated with CBC, RBC morphology, reticulocyte count, serum Fe and TIBC, serum ferritin, vitamin E, and carboxyhemoglobin assay. Hemoglobins were within 1ow normal range, including 23% who were cyanotic. The majority of patients had evidence of hemo lys is, with elevated carboxyhemogl obi n va 1 ues. Hyper ferremia was seen in 28%, and serum ferritins were diminished in 59% of patients. The range for ferritin values was 5 to 55 ng/dl. Vit. E (cx-tocopherol) levels were less than 5 ng/dl in 33'.\\. These! data suggest that some children with cystic fibrosis are relatively anemic, and that iron and vit E. deficiency may significantly contribute to their apparent failure to compensate for hypoxia. Next 22 patients with either low ferritin, Fe, and/ or vit E. were serially given 2 weeks of oral FeS04 followed by 2 weeks of oral FeS04 and vit. E. Variable responses to this therapeutic trial were found. Over half the patients had a significant rise in Hgb of greater than 0.6 gm/dl after the month of FeS04. Those whose ferritin did not rise, did not show a ri,e in Hgb.",

Antibody mediated platelet destruction is a major cause of childhood thromhocytopcnia. Advances in the detection and quantitation of platelet antibodies have aided the diagnosis of these disorders, but little is known about the platelet antigens or receptors involved. We describe a method for separating and im-mobiJ izing platelet proteins, retaining their ability to bind antibodies specifically. Gel filtered human platelets are solubilized in SOS and separated on polyacrylamidc gels. The compon'ent proteins arc elcctrophorctically transferred to nitrocellulose paper. After blocking nonspecific binding sites with albumin and qamma globulin, the inunobilizcd proteins are incubated with antiplatelet antiserum. Antibody bound to a specific protein is then visualized by incubation with 125 1 labeled goat anti-human IgG followed by autoradiography. The PLAl antigen, important in neonatal isoinunune thrombocytopcni.-(NIT), has been linked by indirect evidence to the 100,000 MW protein, GPIIIa. When PLAl positive platelet proteins are studied as above with serum from a PLAl negative mother of an infant with NIT, the radioactivity binds specifically to a single band of 100,000 MW. No specific binding occurs with PI.Al negative platelets or with control serurrL These findings provide direct confirmation that GPIIIa contains the PLAl antigen. The technique developed is rapid, is not limited to the study of 1>rccipitating antibodies, and should be applicable to other immune mediated disorders. MCLNS has been reported to be associated with hematologic abnormalities. We have examined the severity and etiology of these changes in 12 patients who met the standard diagnostic criteria of On admission, the mean hemoglobin level was l0.2g/dl(range 8. 4-12.7) . A mild to moderate anemia usually persisted throughout the illness and the lowest mean hemoglobin was seen on the 5th to 6th hospital day (mean 8.9, range 5.9-12.0g/dl). The anemia was normocytic or mildly microcytic. Leukocytosis was usually present on admission (mean 19,500, range 5,000-28,600/mm3) and increased to a maximum value on the 5th to 6th hospital day (mean 22,700, range 7 ,900-59,80D/mm3). The mean leukocyte count returned to normal by the 16th hospital day. More than 10% band forms were present in 9/12 patients; myelocytes or metamyelocytes were present in 11/12 patients. The mean platelet count on admission was 438,000/mm3 (range 160,000-898,000) with a maximum platelet count between the 11th and 16th hospital day. The platelet counts were > l ,000,000/mm3 in 3 patients but were < l00,000/mm3 in 2 patients. Platelet counts, hemoglobin level and WBC were similar in patients with and without cardiac involvement. MCLNS is commonly associated with a mild to moderate anemia, leukocytosis with a marked left shift, and thrombocytosis. The similarity of these changes to.those found in other inflammatory diseases sugsests a common etiology. The hematologic abnormalities are not predictive of cardiac complications in MCLNS. ----we-have studied the molecular basis of 8-thalassemia in 20 patients, using recombinant DNA cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis of defective 8 globin qenes, analysis of 8 globin gene transcription in vivo and in vitro, and/or analysis of the structure and content of abnormal\" 8 mRNA species by s, nuclease mapping and primer extension techniques. The most common form of B+-thalassemia (10/19 pts) observed was due to a mutation within intervening sequence-1 (IVS-1), creating an alternative mRNA processing splice site. The anomalous splice site is utilized preferentially, creating an abnormal B mRNA species incapable of translation into B globin; a reduced amount of normal 8 mRNA is also qenerated by this qene. The abnormal species accumulates poorly, leaving only the small amount of normally functioninq 8 mRNA. The other patients exhibited either no structurally abnormal B mRNA species or different remnants of IVS-1 or IVS-2.",

Treatment with MC (80mg/kg) prior to DNFB sensitization suppressed the ear swelling response ('80%) in B6, F 1 and aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) inducible backcross and F 2 mice but not in D2 or non-inducible backcross or F 2 mice. Similar observations were made with four additional AHH-inducible and four non-inducible strains of mice. This immunosuppressive response to MC showed the same dose-dependence as AHH induction in responsive mice. Induction of AHH activity by s-naphthoflavone prior to MC treatment resulted in a shift of the dose-response curve for suppression to the left. Thus an ED20 dose of MC was converted to an ED80 dose. Phenobarbital pre-treatment had only a moderate effect on MC-mediated immune suppression. This suggested a requirement for an induced form of the enzyme in the immunosuppressive response. Finally the immunosuppressive response to MC could be completely blocked by prior administration of suggesting a requirement for MC metabolism in the production of the immunosuppressive response. These results suggest a strong positive correlation between carcinogen-mediated suppression of cell-mediated immunity and aromatic hydrocarbon responsiveness in Aggregate GST activity was measured in LPC sonicates usingCDNB as the substrate. The activity in LPC from leukemic children in remission was indistinguishable from that found in cells from unaffected individuals averaging 70 to 120 nmol/min/mg. LPC GST activity was compared to that found in human liver cytosol. While enzyme specific activity was 5 to 7-fold higher in liver, the GST activities in the two tissues were identical with respect to pH, ionic strength and substrate concentration dependence as well as thermal inactivation. The response of GST activity to exposure to various antioxidant compounds was studied in LPC cultured in the presence and absence of mitogens. The antioxidants studied were BHA, BHT, ethoxyquin (E) and (AT) . Culturing in the presence or absence of mitogen had little effect on GST activity. In the absence of mitogen antioxidants were without effect. In the presence of mitogen all four compounds caused a dose-dependent increase in GST activity in cells from non-leukemic individuals. The maximal increase was 2 to 3-fold and the order of potency was AT>E>BHA>BHT. BHA was tested for its ability to induce GST activity in cells from leukemic children in remission. At doses of 5 to 10 which results in maximal GST induction in normal cells no increase in activity was observed. These results suggest that the cytoprotective enzyme GST is inducible in human cells and that leukemic children are deficient in this response. The efficacy of corticosteroids in childhood acute ITP is controversial and has not been evaluated in a controlled randomized study. We examined the value of prednisone (2 mg/kg/day for 14 days with subsequent tapering and discontinuation by day 21) in 27 children with newly diagnosed ITP. Patients were randomized to receive either prednisone or placebo. Platelet count, bleeding time (a test of the integrity of the platelet-microvasculature interaction), and clinical bleeding tendency (scored on a 0-4+ scale) were determined before (day OJ and six times following initiation of drug therapy (days 1-2, 3-5, 7, 14, 21, and 28) . Patients in the steroid and placebo groups were similar with respect to age, sex, initial platelet count and bleeding score, duration of bleeding symptoms, and history of antecedent infection. There were no statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups in any of the three parameters except on day 7 of therapy when children receiving prednisone had higher platelet counts and lower bleeding scores than those receiving placebo. Bleeding score and bleeding time generally correlated with the platelet count. Prednisone did not influence bleeding time or clinical bleeding score independent of its effect on platelet count. We conclude that prednisone does not improve hemostasis or reduce bleeding tendency in childhood acute ITP except transiently at the end of one week of treatment. J NT!'

In order to determine the role of oxygen and its metabolites on the activation and inactivation of the membrane bound superoxide (02) generating oxidase, we stimulated guinea pig peritoneal cavity granulocytes (PMN) under aerobic and anaerobic conditions and exami ned activity as a function of time. With a soluble stinulant phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), membrane enriched particles from PMN generated similar maximal NADPH dependent 02 production under aerobic (43.5 2.2 nlTOl 02/min/mg pro) and anaerobic (3B.4 2.4 nlTOl 02/ min/mg pro) conditions. However, under aerobic condi ti ans activity fell over I20 ninutes with a pseudo first order rate constant or .0283 min-I. Under anaerobic conditions, there was no significant change in oxidase activity for up to I20 minutes. NADPH dependent 02 prod!ction after I20 minutes was 36.8 + 1.5 nlTOl 02/min/mg pro for anaerobic stimulation, compared with T.7 + 0.3 n1TOl 02/min/mg pro for aerobic 5timulation. Neither cytochrome c, cyanide, superoxide dismutase, catalase, nor benzoate could prevent aerobic inactivation. NADPH dependent 02 production is phagocytic vesicles made from pmn which had ingested opsonized lipopolysaccharide coated oil droplets for 5 minutes was equivalent under aerobic (I9.9 + 2.5 n1TOl 02/min/mg pro) and anaerobic (23.2 + 4.6 n1TOl 02/min/mgpro) conditions. However, inactivation of the oxidase occurred to the same extent under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. We conclude that for PMA but not for opsonized particle stimulated cells, inactivation of the oxidase is dependent entirely on oxygen or an .internally generated oxygen metabolite.

To determine if chemoattractants exert a regulatory influence on neutrophil cytotoxic responses, and target cells were preincubated with chemoattractants and subsequently exposed to 5ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate. Cytotoxicity was determined by assaying 01 Cr release from prelabeled target cells and by measuring changes in small ion permeability. Both myeloid leukemia K562 cells and freshly isolated mononuclear leukocytes were used as turget cells. Two types of chemoattractants were studied; those which stimulate neutrophil oxidative metabolism at concentrations higher than those required for chemotaxis (C5a, FMLP) and those which do not stimulate neutrophil oxidative metabolism at any concentration (casrin, unheated serum). At low concentrations, the former chemoattractants strikingly enhanced PMA-stimulated cytotoxicity. In contrast, chemotactic concentrations of casein and serum failed to augment the cytotoxicity of neutrophils. Cytotoxicity enhanced by different concentrations of FMLP correlated with the rate of superoxide release and with the degree of chemiluminescence, but not with the extent of superoxide release. We conclude that cellular processes activated initial encounters of neutrophils and certain chemoattractants enhance subsequent cytotoxic activity. These processes may contribute to tissue damage at sites of inflammation.",

Lukens, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN Neutrophil hyperadherence stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) was characterized by assessing the attachment of labeled cells to plastic surfaces. PMA failed to stimulate adherence in the presence of N-ethyl maleimide, 2-deoxyglucose, or at low temperatures. However, adding these inhibitors to adherent cells, or exposing adherent cells to o 0 c for extended times, failed to effect surface detachment. These results suggest that an activity energy consuming process was involved in the initiation but not the persistance of adherence. That adherence was mediated by an intracellular factor was further supported by a close correlation between lysozyme release and the degree of adherence under a variety of conditions. Thus, inhibitors and suboptimal temperatures consistently affected adherence and er.zy1><2 release to the same extent. Further the kinetics of stimulation of adherence closely paralleled the rate of lysozyme release at each concentration of PMA tested. On the other hand, adherence, lysozyme release, was completely inhibited by omission of Mg++. However, the neutrophil adherence factor, from specific granules, was also found to require Mg+ for expression of activity. These results support the hypothesis that a preformed Mg++ dependent intracellular factor is integrally involved in the process of neutrophil adherence. years, who had ALL diagnos(.>d no lc>ss than six months before the study hcgan and who had no relapses, or signs of CNS leukemia.

Incubation of neutrophils with RSV-antibody complexes resulted in a significant increase in chemiluminescence production. The increase in chemiluminescence appeared to be due to l. active phagocytosis of RSV-antibody complexes as evidenced by its inhibition with cytochalasin B (p<.001) 2. increased superoxide production as evidenced by its inhibition with superoxide dismutase (p<.001). The generation of superoxide was confirmed by specific analysis in a superoxide dismutase inhibitable ferricytochrome C reduction assay. Of particular importance was the observation that RSV-antibody complexes induced the release of significant quantities of thromboxane B2 from neutrophils as determined by a radioil11llune assay. These data document the release of superoxide and thromboxane 82 upon ingestion of complexes by neutrophils. It is proposed that oxygen radicals and products of ardchidonic acid metabolism may, in part, mediate pathogenesis of RSV infection through direct tissue damage and bronchoconstriction. .

This may be either a consequence of the disease process or its treatment. A study was undertaken to determine whether macrocytosis was seen in association with Hodgkin's disease (HD) and what the significance of this finding might be. Twenty three children (<16 yrs) with varying stages of HD were studied throughout the course of their illness. Macrocytosis was not present in any child at the time of diagnosis. The mean MCV was 77.5 fl with 28% of the children 2 S.D. <mean for age for MCV. This initial microcytosis had no apparent etiology and was felt to represent the anemia of chronic disorders. In a group of adults with HD matched for stage, 10% of subjects also demonstrated microcytosis. None had macrocytosis. There was no re lat ions hip betw.een MCV at diagnosis and disease stage. By 6 mos. from the start of therapy 80% of the children exhibited MCV's >2 S.D. above normal mean MCV for age. Macrocytosis was noted in 4/4 patients with S-IVB disease treated with chemotherapy (MOPP) alone and in 13/15 subjects with S-II-III disease treated with chemotherapy and radiation. Subjects treated with irradiation alone did not exhibit macrocytosis. Following cessation of therapy macrocytosis persisted in 9/15 subjects for 1 to >6 years. These data indicate that macrocytosis may occur during the course of treatment of H.D. as a result of chemotherapy, not the disease itself or radiation. The reason for tl1e persistance of macrocytosis in some subjects and its ship to risk of second malignancy requires further study. Congenital dysgranulopoietic neutropenia (CON) is a recently proposed entity that describes a small subgroup of children with clinically severe neutropenia. We followed and studied a 3-yearold female with neutropenia (<500/1111l3) and recurrent severe infections in whom repeated marrow evaluations revealed large (30-50 um) multinucleated promyelocytes to polymorphonuclear cells with as many as 4 to 16 nuclei or nuclear lobes respectively. In addition to the nuclear endoreduplication, ultrastructural and cytochemical evaluation of these cells demonstrated abnormalities in granule genesis and centriole structure. Concomitantly, immunoperoxidase staining indicated that many of the granules were devoid of lactoferrin but not lysozyme. In vitro proliferation studies from blood and marrow mononuclear cells revealed normal to increased thymidine labelling, normal numbers of colony-forming cells and normal colony stimulating activity. These findings support ineffective myelopoeisis and provide a cause for the neutropenia. Serum folate, Bi2 and lysozyme levels were normal. Conceivably, the marked nuclear and cytoplasmic abnormalities in this patient could be secondary to abnormal centriole directed microtubule function, resulting in this unique example of CON. Two hundred ninety-five children with SS disease less than three years of age were prospectively evaluated for: a) the development of severe bacterial infection (i.e., bacteria cultured from CSF, blood, pleural fluid or lung tissue); b) splenic function (i.e., the presence of vesiculated rbc; and c) whether they had received prophylactic penicillin or vaccination for Streptococcus pneumoniae.",

We observed that ADA activity could discriminate normal mononuclear cells (4.9 \u00b1 1.2) from mixtures of normal mononuclear cells containing 5% malignant T-cells (9.4 \u00b1 1 .2). In addition, adenosine deaminase activity in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (4.9 \u00b1 1.2) was markedly increased (15.0 \u00b1 3.2) when a small fraction of ma-1 ignant T-cells (equivalent to 2% of peripheral blood leukocytes) was added to whole blood before mononuclear cell separation. Lastly, ADA activity in normal bone marrow mononuclear cells (5.6 \u00b1 1.5) also was increased (14.l \u00b1 3.1) when a small fraction of malignant T-cells {equivalent to 1% of marrow nucleated cells) was added to normal bone marrow before mononuclear cell separation.

HLCT was clinically very effective for bleeding episodes in haemophilia A so that both in vivo and in vitro experiments were done. Extract of HLCT was given orally 0.15g/kg to a patient with severe haemophilia A. Plasma concentration of factor VIII rose from less than 1% to 41% one hour after oral administration. APTT also shortened from 102\"9 to 70\"9. In vitro experiment, HLCT revealed to have activities of factor VIII, IX and X at concentrations around 0.08%. to yellow red and brown.

A benign diagnosis in many instances may prevent unnecessary surgical procedures. Severe aplastic anemia is associated with a 70-80% mortality in patients treated with supportive care, with or without androgens. While marrow transplantation is a preferred option, clear improvement in survival in all patient groups has not been achieved. In particular, Elfenbein et al. have recently documented poor transplant results in Black patients with aplasia. Over the past two years, we have treated 15 patients with severe aplastic anemia with either anti-thymocyte or anti-thoracic duct lymphocyte globulin. Of these patients, 10 are alive 2-36 months post treatment (Median; 12 months). Of 5 Caucasian patients, only 2 are alive, and only one has enjoyed a partial remission of his disease. In contrast, of 7 Black patients treated, 5 have achieved complete hematologic remissions. Five patients are surviving. One patient died of sepsis during treatment; another died of an accident while in complete remission 9 months post therapy. These preliminary results suggest the possibility that Black patients may be at particular risk for \"autoirrrnune\" forms of aplastic anemia responsive to this form of immunosuppressive therapy. Blood coagulation factor activities are dependent upon gestational age as shown in both premature infants and in chronically catheterized fetal lambs. Eight sets of chronically catheterized twin lamb fetuses were studied to determine if cortisol would the development of blood coagulation. One twin from each pair was infused intraperitoneally with cortisol (2 mg/ 0.8 cc/hr for 48 hrs) while its twin sib was infused with normal saline (0.8 cc/hr). Changes in coagulation factor activities measured before and after the infusions were analyzed using a paired T test. Significant differences between cortisol infused (c) and saline infused (s) sibs were apparent: blood cortisol +31.8 pg/dl (c), +2 pg/dl (s), p;0.001; Factor II +16.6% (c), +2% (s), p;0.006; Factor V +54% (c), +18.2% (s), p;0.002; Factor VII +24% (c), +0.1% (s), p;0.01; Factor X +26% (c), -1% (s), p;0.001; Factor XII +9.4% (c), +l .4% (s), p;Q.025.

Betamethasone at 15 mg/day for 2 days given to pregnant ewes resulted in changes in fetal coagulation factors similar to those observed when lambs were given cortisol directly (Factor II +14%, Factor V +58%, Factor Vil +31%, Factor X +22%, Factor XII +10%). Results indicate that cortisol accelerates the development of blood coagulation and suggest that coagulation factor activities might be improved by giving betamethasone to mothers at high risk for premature delivery.

In this study the clinical course of 8 children with DBS was correlated with the ability of their bone marrow mononuclear cells to form erythroid colonies in methyl cellulose culture. One child did not respond to steroids but produced large numbers of erythroid colonies in culture. This child may have a defect in the hematopoietic microenvironment. Three children maintained satisfactory hemoglobin levels on low dose alternate day steroid therapy and produced normal numbers of erythroid colonies in culture. Four children required higher doses of steroids to maintain satisfactory hemoglobin levels and produced low numbers of erythroid colonies in culture. The latter two groups of children 2'-Deoxycoformycin (dCF), a potent inhibitor of adenosine deaminase (ADA), has been effective in the treatment of T-cell, but not B-cell leukemias, a finding that appears to be related to the ability of T, but not B-lymphoblasts to trap deoxyadenosine (dAdo) as dATP. Both increased ability of T-cells to phosphorylate dAdo, and of B-cells to degrade deoxyribonucleotides could explain this distinction. However, differences in activities of c!Ado kinases and cytoplasmic deoxyribonucleotidase in T-and B-cell lines are not sufficient to account for the 100-fold difference in their capacity to accumulate dATP. To further evaluate the basis for this phenomenon we have developed human B-cell/T-cell hybrid cell lines, and evaluated 1) sensitivity to the cytotoxic effect of dAdo, 2) ability to accwnulate dATP, and 3) ability to degrade intracellular dATP after expansion of this pool by prior incubation with c!Ado. We fused CEM(T) cells with either Wl-L2 (B) cells, or with a double mutant derived from Wl-L2 that lacked both enzymes necessary to phosphorylate dAdo (adenosine and deoxycytidine kinases D AK--dCK-). The concentration of dAdo required for 50% growth inhibition of CEM, WI-L2, and several CEM/WI-L2 hybrids were respectively, 0.35\u00b5M, 45\u00b5M, and 15-35\u00b5M. The hybrids were intermediate in their capacity to accwnulate dATP, and in their capacity to catabolize an expanded dATP pool. CEM/AK--dcK-hybrids were resistant to dAdo. Our results thus far indicate that \"Bness\" is dominant over nT-ness\", and are consistc11t with the opertion in B-cells of a mechanism, possibly enhanced nucleotidase activity, that diminishes the ability to accwnulate dATP from dAdo. Prior studies implicated a tightly-linked membrane in the NB rat as responsible for decreased deformability and survival (Ped. Res. 14:536,1980) .To test for a similar change in human NB RBC, we studied spectrin extractability by lmM EDTA (pH 8,37\u00b0C,25min) from fresh RBC ghosts of normal adults and from cord blood of normal fullterm NB. We also studied solubility of Triton X-100 (0.5%,30min,OOC) treated ghosts in cyanate-free urea (0.25-1 M). Washed Triton shells were suspended in buffer to an optical density(OD) of 0.4 at 360nm.

Twenty-eight pts. prospectively rated their nausea and vomiting, and the extent to which these symptoms \"bothered\" them (i.e., made them sad, worried, or physically uncomfortable) and disrupted their daily routines (e.g., school, peers, etc.). Pt. compliance with data gathering was 100%. Thirteen of these pts. (46%) reported minimal vomiting and 8 had vomiting but died or tenninated their The remaining 7 pts. rated their symptoms during a mean of 2.7 chemotherapy courses before and 4.4 courses following beh. Rx. Courses were matched for drug types and dosages for each pt. Drugs included adriamycin, cytoxan, vincristine, high-dose methotrexate, 5-Azacytidine, Ara-C, and L-asparaginase. Beh. Rx was designed to reduce anxiety, distract the pt., encourage positive expectations, reward \"well\" behavior, reduce rewards for \"sick\" behavior, and induce relaxation. Mean course ratings for each pt. were derived for baseline and for post-intervention time periods and were analyzed by paired t-tests. Following intervention, reductions were obtained in nausea (p<.03), vomiting (p<.05), \"bother\" (p<.05), and \"disruption\" (p<.025). We conclude that behavioral techniques can reduce vomiting and disability associated with intensive regimens of chemotherapy. Neonatal red blood cells (RBC) are less filterable and have a shorter life-span than adult RBC, suggesting that neonatal RBC are less deformable. We have studied cellular deformability of RBC by means of a counter rotating Rheoscope (D) and by measuring the pressure (Pt) required to aspirate whole cells into micropipettes with internal diameters of 3.311m. Smaller pipettes were used to study geometric properties: viz, volume (V), surface area (SA), excess surface area beyond that required to enclose the cell volume (ESA), and mechanical properties: viz.elastic shear modulus ( l'), time constant of viscoelastic recovery (tc), membrane viscosity (n=:ixtc)., of RBC. Results from 10 neonatal (N) and 10 adult (A) blood samples were: We have previously demonstrated that adults and children with steroid resistant OBA exhibit low to absent bone marrow EP colony growth in culture. However, OBA is usually sensitive to steroids suggesting that EP may be present in many newly diagnosed patients. To evaluate this possibility we measured EP frequency in the plasma clot cultures of marrows of 10 newly diagnosed or relapsed steroid resistant patients who were not receiving steroid therapy. 5 of 6 newly diagnosed patients (age 2-8 mos.) had normal or nearly normal marrow EP derived colonies, and all 5 responded promptly to steroid therapy. One had low EP and failed to respond. In contrast, 4 steroid resistant patients (age 13-64 mos.) had reduced to absent EP derived colonies that were in 2 cases stimulated to develop in reduced numbers only after addition of T cell derived burst promoting activity (BPA) to the culture medium. This requirement for BPA suggests immaturity of the residual EP population. These results show that OBA is a heterogeneous disorder at the progenitor level. Some patients exhibit blocks in EP maturation between CFU-E and erythroblasts and have nonnal EP numl>ers. Others have blocks l>etween CFU-S and BFU-E, lack EP and fail to respond to steroids. Responsiveness to steroids may therefore relate to the level at which EP maturation is impaired. To determine if fetal hemoglobin accumulation in erythroid cells is controlled by the level of progenitor matur'ity from which these ce 11 s derive or by environmenta l factors acting on erythroblasts, we measured the growth characteristics and. by radio ligand-immunoessay proportions of HbA and HbF in normal adult rhesus marrow erythroid colonies cultured in plasma clots. Pooled CFU-E colonies contained 3-12% Hbf while pooled BFU-E colonies contained 25-45% Hbf. A subpopulation of CFU-E was found to form colonies in the absence of added erythropoietin(epo). These \"highly epo responsive cells\" (HERCs) produced small colonies with no Hbf. These findings, show that simian bone marrow contains a hierar\u2022:hy of erythroid progeni tors which differ in globin gene expression(decreasing HbF with increasing maturity)in the colonies to which they give rise. The HbF: Hb\u00b7' ratio in BFU-E and CFU-E derived colonies increased in prorortion to the level of crude epo in cultures, burst promoting activity influenced the HbF:HbA ratio in BFU-E derived C'-1G\u00b7 nies only. Thus the ability to express maximal HbF in progenitor derived erythroid cells is influenced by environmental factors and progenitor maturity. We propose that erythrocytes produced in normal steady states are derived from the most mature progenitors, whereas increased HbF oroduction in stress results from the direct differentiation of immature progenitors. HbF synthesis may be further influenced by epo and BPA action on erythroid precursors and/or progenitors. A clinical trial of Li therapy was undertaken in a S-year-old boy with GSD, Type IR, variable neutropenia, and neutrophil dysfunction. Prior to therapy, absolute granulocyte numbers (AGN) ranged: 234-774/mm1. Neutrophil function and assays revealed diminished random motility (30% of control value) and directed migration (4S% of control values), by modified Boyden technique; diminished bipolar configuration change; absence of enhancement of adherence properties and distribution of surface adhesive sites with conditions of chemotactic stimulation. Colonyst imulating activity (CSA) production of patient (PT) and control (C) mononuclear cells (MNC), +/-Li at 1 meq/L, was studied using standard agar clonogenic assays and reported as colonyforming units in culture (CFUc) per 1 x lOS/ml normal bone marrow cells.

Normal full term CB yielded a mean of 1425 colonies/ml. The number of CB-CFU-C's was not influenced by mode of delivery, apgar scores, or CB total WBC, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) or hemoglobin. The mean CFU-C/ANC ratio was 0.41. Cultures of CB obtained from IDM's formed a mean of 2700 colonies/ml with a CFU-C/ANC ratio of 0.72. Cultures of CB from 2 preterm infants yielded less colonies (200/ml) than observed in normals. A 34 wk gestation infant, born to a woman receiving chemotherapy for AL was also evaluated. The number of CB-CFU-C's from this infant was not significantly increased (3210/ml) but the ratio of CFU-C's/ANC (2.68) was well outside the range determined for normal full term or preterm infants. Thus, CB-CFU-C's were not affected by the various maternal and newborn parameters",

The age range at initiation of treatment was 3 7/12-23 8/12 yrs and age range at time of evaluation was 4 1/12-24 1/2 yrs. The radiation treatment consisted of approximately 3600 rads to the neuraxis with a 1500 rad boost to the posterior fossa. The approximate mean radiation dose to the hypothalamic-pituitary region and thyroid gland were 3600 and 2300 rads respectively. In 9/11 patients the skeletal age was within one year of the chronological age. Growth hormone reserve was deficient in 5/11. Somatomedin C was decreased for age in 2/9 patients. Cortisol response to insulin-induced hypgolycemia was inadequate in 1/7. TSH response to TRH testing performed in 9 patients and was normal in 3, compatible with 1 thyroid dysfunction in 5 and suggestive of hypothalamic dysfunction in 1. One patient developed abnormal thyroid function 12 mos after an initially nonnal evaluation. Since endocrine evaluation was not obtained prior to therapy, we cannot be certain that the decribed abnonnalities were a consequence of treatment. However our results argue that children who have received CNS radiation formal ignant posterior fossa lesions should have continued evaluation to allow for early detection of honnonal deficiencies and institution of appropriate reolacement therapy. Fanconi's anemia is a genetic disorder characterized by congenital malformations, abnonnal chromosomal instability and progressive marrow failure. Inheritance patterns suggest an autosomal recessive disorder but with heteroqeneity. Histocompatibi lity studies were performed on 11 patients Fanconi 's anemia documented by clinical and cytogenetic findings. Parental consanguinity could be established in only 1 case. Nevertheless, by virtue of oarental sharing of HLA haplotypes, 6/11 patients were found to be HLA-A,B identical to either the mother (5 cases) or the father (1 case). Of these 6 patients, 5 were also shown to be HLA-D identical to one of their parents. An additional patient, found to be HLA-D compatible with his mother, was mismatched only for an HLA-B specificity. Patients did not exhibit common HLA phenotypes, nor was an abnormal frequency of any phenotype observed. That the disorder is not 1 inked to HLA, is suggested by the i dentifi ca ti on of norma 1 heterozyoo+<w; for this disorder among the patients' HLA-matched siblings. The higher incidence of histocompatibility between Fanconi's anemia patients and their parents is not explained. Materna-fetal histocompatibility is known in animals to influence fetal growth and hematopoietic development. Whether such compatibility affects the clinical expression of the genetic defects of Fanconi's anemia remains to be determined. of Pediatrics, Torrance, Ca. In vitro aggregation of cord blood or neonatal polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) has not been fully evaluated. Using a spectrophotometric aggregometer/recorder system, we studied the responses of cord blood PMN(CPMN) to soluble chemotactic and their metabolic and divalent cation requirements.

Pre-incubation with cytochalasin B (CB) resulted in a potentiation of the aggregation responses of both adult PMN and CPMN. Optimal aggregation occurred in the presence of both ca+2 and Mg+2. CPMN stimulated by FMLP after incubation with CB in media devoid of divalent cations demonstrated an aggregation response (28cm2) whereas the adult PMN did not (20cm2). The glycolytic inhibitors 2 deoxyglucose and KCN blunted the aggregation responses of both CPMN and adult PMN by 50%. The mitochondrial toxins NaF and lodoacetate had no effect on aggregation. Stir bar rate also did not affect the amplitude of aggregation of the CPMN or adult PMN. Unlike recently reported deficient aggregation response of CPMN, these studies show similarities in the metabolic requirements and aggregation responses of adult and CPMN, while a significant difference in divalent cation requirements is demonstrated when CPMN are rendered secretory with CB. Polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes become chemotactic, degranulate, and aggregate upon stimulation with soluble chemotactic factors such as n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP). We have devised a modification (micro) of the in vitro spectrophotometric aggregation assay of Craddock et al requiring as little as 5 x 105 PMN per sample. Quantitation of FMLP induced aggregation was accomplished using a 2 polar planiweter demonstrat7d a dose effect of 17cm at 2 x lo-M, 23cm at 2 x lo-M and 29cm at 2 2 x lo-5M in the macro method. A response of 19cm2, 29cm2 and 36cm was seen using the micromethod. PMN rendered secretory with cytochalasin B (CB) 2.5\u00b5g/ml resulted in potentiation of the aggregation response with FMLP 2 x lo-7 of 35% in the microassay and 45% in macroassay. Correlation between both assays on both secretory (rs;.96) and non secretory (rns;.B5)PMN was high. In both the macro and micro assays aggregation was blunted by the glycolytic metabolic inhibitors 2 deoxy-d-glucose (lmM) and Iodoacetate (lmM) by 50%. No suppression of the aggregation response was seen with the mitochondrial toxins NaF and KCN. Divalent cations (ca+2 and Mg+2) were required for an optimal aggregation response to FMLP. The amplitude of the FMLP induced aggregation was not affected by changes of stir speed from 300 to 1200 RPM. Reduced cell numbers, sample size, and quantitation allows the use of aggregometry studies of the PMN in the pediatric population and neonatal PMN which are known to be functionally deficient. Acute respiratory disease (ARD) is a common problem among children with sickle cell disease (SCD), and is especially prevalent during painful truncal crisis (PTC). We have observed in patients hospitalized for PTC with normal initial physical and radiographic chest examinations, the development 2 to 4 days later of an acute lung syndrome (ALS) characterized by fever, tachypnea, and infiltrates on chest radiograph. This delayed ALS accounted for 23% of all cases of ARD occurring in patients hospitalized for pain, and was limited to those with trunk pain. To identify possible etiologic factors, we compared the 12 PTC/ALS admissions with the 22 other admissions of the same 10 patients for PTC without ALS. There were no significant differences with respect to age, antecedent URI, admission findings (temp.,resp. rate, WBC and diff,), isolation of bacterial pathogens, or antibiotic administration, Slightly more fluids were received during PTC/ALS admissions. Narcotic administration was compared by assigning analgesic equivalent units according to established analgesic ratios, and a narcotic score was calculated for the first 48 hours of treatment. The mean narcotic score (\u00b1 SE) for PTC/ALS admissions was 21 (\u00b1 4) as compared to 6 (\u00b1 1) for those PTC admissions not associated with ALS (p < 0.0005). The association of ALS with PTC and high narcotic score suggests hypoventilation as an etiologic factor in the development of this common, \u00b7possibly preventable, complication of painful crisis.

            "text": "-------- For the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease As part of our national study of the clinical course of sickle cell diseases, splenic function has been systematically assessed in more than lOG'l patients with various sickling disorders. Blood was collected in the 27 individual centers, fixed in buffered 3% glutaraldehyde, and shipped to a central lab for enumeration of percent pocked RBC using interference phase-contrast microscopy. In HbSS disease, a rapid and progressive increase in pocked RBC was seen after 6 months of age. Although there was considerable individual variability, most patients had >3% pocked RBC after 1-2 years of age. A pocked RBC percentage of >3-5% correlated with functional hyposplenia by 99mTc scans. 14 children who developed severe bacterial infections had high percentages of pocked RBC. Patients with SC disease had slight impairment of splenic function which did not progress with age. Distinctly different patterns of splenic function were seen in patients with Hb SB 0 and those with Hb ss+ thalassemia. Hb SB+ thalassemia approximated SC disease, while Hb SB 0 thalassemia resembled HbSS. These patterns provide insights into splenic function in the various sickling disorders. They may also assist in formulation of management strategies for anticipation and prevention of serious bacterial infections in these patients. The median age at diagnosis (dx) was 5 yr.; 17 were male and 15 female. One pt had microscopic residual tumor (Group II) after grossly complete removal. 24 pts bad gross residual local tumor (Gp.

Sites of initial recurrence included the meninges (7 pts), distant metastases or local regrowth (4 pts each), regional recurrence (1 pt), or contralateral glioma (I pt). Outcome was also influenced by signs at dx indicating risk of meningeal tumor: intracranial extension (ICE), petrous bone erosion (BE), or cranial nerve palsy (CNP).

Mean birth weight was 1229\u00b1314 g, mean gestational age 31.5\u00b11.5 wks. Simultaneous changes in eosinophils (E), total lymphocytes, suppressor and helper cells, neutrophils and IgE were monitored. Infants were designated as responders (R) (E>lOOO/cu mm for >5 days) and non-responders (NR). In R (n=6), E increased from 353\u00b176 (mean\u00b1 SEM) at birth to a peak of 2783\u00b1430/cu mm at 21-25 days.

Lymphocytes, suppressor and helper cells increased progressively in both groups over the period of study, with no differences between R and NR. Birth weight and gestational age were similar in both groups, and there were no apparent causes for the lower neutrophils in Rat birth (e.g., maternal disease, drugs, neonatal sepsis). Rand NR had similar exposure to blood transfusions, antibiotics, intravenous nutrition and artificial formula. Bacterial sepsis was not observed in any infant. Eosinophilia was not related to an IgE response. The incidence of eosinophilia is similar to that reported previously, and appears to be a maturational response occurring after an initial neutrophilia in those premature infants born with a lower neutrophil count. Childhood ALL is composed of subgroups defined by immunologic markers and certain markers are known to have prognostic significance. Null cell ALL is the largest subgroup and additional markers are needed to identify patients at increased risk of early relapse within this non-T, non-B category. We have used a direct immunofluorescence assay to identify the presence of receptors for the lectin peanut agglutin (PNA) on blasts from 26/46 (63%) of our null cell ALL patients and have subsequently noted a high rate of relapse (17/26) in this PNA+ group. Relapse has occurred in only 5/20 patients whose blasts lacked the PNA receptor. The PNA+ and PNA-groups were comparable in clinical features (i.e., age, leukocyte count, follow-up times) and the striking difference in relapse rate was correlated only with the presence of receptors for the lectin (p<0.01). PNA receptors are commonly found on fetal thymocytes but not on mature peripheral lymphocytes 3 except after neuraminidase treatment. SOS-PAGE analysis of NaB H 4 -galactose oxidase labelled solubilized cell membrane extracts revealed a 68,000 dalton glycoprotein found only on PNA+ ALL lymphoblasts. Neither PNA-blasts nor PNA+ normal thymocytes expressed this component. The lectin PNA seems to define a high risk group of null cell ALL patients and to be associated with a specific cell membrane component. ThP management of AML dif f crs markedly from that of acute lymphocyt le leuko,mia (ALL). The differences in underlying disease and the types of therapies used might be expected to lead to differing 1\u00b7ates of infectious complications in these two forms of let1kemia. In an attempt to identify any relationship between fever, granul0cytopenia (<1000 polys/ul), infection and disease status, 20 patients with AML were observed over a period of 16. 5 patient years and comparisons were made with our previous experience with ALL (Wolk et al, Am J Dis Child 131:157, 1977) .In AML an infectious origin for fever was found in 70% of fevers d11ring induction, in 25% in remission, and in 67% in relapse. In ALL, the cause of the fever was identified in 27% of fevers d11ring induction. in 65% in remission, and in 8% in relapse. In AML, the most common infectious causes for fever in induction and relapse were sepsis (33% of fevers) and pneumonia (45% of fevers). In induction and relapse among patir>nts with AML wLo had pneumonia the most common causative organism recovered from needle aspirations or open lung biopsies was mycoplasma pneumoniae (50% of all pneumonias). This organism was rarely seen during induction or relapse nf ALL but arco11nted for 14.5% of fevers in remission. Persistance of M. pneumonia in the throat for many months was common.",

Southwest Oncolooy Group project #7581 was initiated in 12/1975 to evaluate the effect of ALL as well as chemotherapy and irradiation on body growth, serum growth honnone (GH) and somatomedin (Sm) concentrations. The study included 127 children from 5 participating institutions, 83 males and 44 females, with a mean age at ALL diagnosis of 6.6 years. Height, weight, and honnonal concentrations were determined at the time of initial diagnosis and at reqular intervals for up to 5 years of follow-up. 84% of children were observed for longer than 12 months. Boys <4 years showed significant growth retardation (P<.Ol) at diagnosis. Growth retardation persisted through ALL therapy so that 83% of these patients were qrowing below the 50th percentile by the end of observation (P<.Oi). Linear regression analysis of growth rates in children with ALL versus nonnal standards confinned differences in growth patterns. Serum GH and Sm concentrations were similar to controls. However, honnone levels at initial diagnosis were significantly higher than during remission (P<.001). In conclusion, our data suggest that a significant number of children with ALL are shorter than their peers prior to onset of therapy. GH and Sm levels appear to be elevated at the time of disease onset and to decrease with therapy. The median length of the initial hospitalization was 4 days (range 0 to 51 days); the median length of subsequent hospitalizations was 3 days (51.1% primarily for the administration of chemotherapy, 19.2% because of suspected or proven infection, and 5.6% for transfusions). The median number of hospitalizations per Only 13 pregnancies (25.5%) resulted in full term births. There were 18 premature births (58.1% of total live births). Total fetal wastage (abortions and death in utero) occurred in 17 instances (33% of total pregnancies). The mean birth weight of the 13 full term infants was 3336. Gm. with a range of 2758-4508 Gm. Cesarean section was performed in 11 mothers. The average hemoglobin levels in the patients was 9.4 grams (SD\u00b1 2.1) and the average hematocrit was 28% (SD\u00b1 5.8%). In 8 (17%) of the subjects, the diastolic blood pressure was greater than 140 mmHg. Urinary trace infections occurred in 34.1% of the mothers.

There were seven episodes of crises, preeclampsia/eclampsia occurred in A method which can be used to determine susceptibility to chickenpox rapidly, accurately and which can be performed routinely is sorely needed. This is particularly important in the management of children who are at high risk of complications should they develop chickenpox. Determination of varicella-zoster (V-Z) antibody by ELISA, using antigen coated plates that can be stored at 4\u00b0C for at least two months, has correctly predicted the outcome of exposed individuals following household exposure. There has been a 97% correlation (140/144) with the fluorescent antibody against membrane antigen -FAMA assay. Results have been reproducible with different lots of antigen and conjugate. In testing children in our oncology program, 2 of 27 who were said to have had varicella were found to be susceptible; 10 of 30 with a negative history were seropositive. Of the 10, three had recently received ZIG and 2 others blood transfusions. On retesting of sera obtained subsequently from these 5 children, all were found to be susceptible. Testing of children who are at a high risk of complications of chickenpox for immunity by ELISA should replace reliance on past history. Testing should become a routine part of their care to provide guidance as to the risk of exposure to chickenpox and the need for passive immunization. The technique is also useful for rapid identification of susceptibles, should a patient develop chickenpox on an inpatient service. Carnitine, a1i essential cofactor for transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria for oxidation, is normally synthesized in liver and kidney. Dietary carnitine is not sufficient to prevent lethal disease in patients with congenital defects in carnitine biosynthesis (carnitine deficiency). Twin girls presented with Hgb 4 to 5 gm/dl and absent bone marrow erythroid precursors at 3-1/2 mos, while receiving a soy formula, which contains no carnitine. Erythroblastopenia resolved spontaneously when diets were liberalized. Both children developed fatty infiltration of liver, heart and muscle and recurrent hypoglycemia with fasting. Systemic carnitine deficiency was documented in both, with deficient butyrobetaine hydroxylase activity in liver. One child died. The other is doing well on oral L-carnitine, but mild anemia (hgb 10 gm) and reticulocytosis (2-3%) persist. Red cells are normocytic without i antigen. Hgb F is 1-2%.

Diminished chemotaxis has been consistently demonstrated in nE.utrophils (N) obtained from human neonates. We measured the binding of tritiated formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalaniue (FMLP-H 3 i to N obtained from 10 human neonates and 10 adult controls to determine whether N assumed to exhibit decreased chemotaxis also have abnormal chemotactic factor binding. N were isolated from venous blood and were incubated at 22\u00b0C for 20 min with FMLP-H 3 (40 nM) either in the absence (total binding) or presence (nonspecific binding) of excess (l0-4 M) nonradioactive (cold) FMLP. N with bound FMLP were separated from free FMLP molecules by rapid centrifugation through silicone oil. N pellets were dissolved in scintillation fluid and radioactivity was measured. Neonates' N bound significantly less FMLP-H3 than did control N (total cpm bound per 2 x 10 6 N were 7,444 \u00b1 677 and 10,435 \u00b1 763, respectively). Likewise, specific binding (total binding -nonspecific binding) was less (p < .02) by neonates' N (6,223 \u00b1 614 cpm) than by control N (8,903 \u00b1 722 cpm}.

The metabolism of l-14c-AA(53-55 or 255 Ci/mole) by these cells and by platelets isolated from the same animals was evaluated using an AA concentration of 5 \u00b5M/for 5'. Megs were demonstrated to convert AA to metabolites of both the lipoxygenase (12 HETE) and cycloxygenase pathway (HHT and TXB2). These products were identified by their mobility in TLC analyses both as free fatty acids and methyl ester derivatives, as well as by their comigration with authentic standards or the AA metabolites of human platelets.

This elevation has been used as a marker of tumor activity, also prognostic significance has been attributed to LOH levels in adults with NHL, particularly those with histiocytic type. LOH serum levels (Normal 98-230 U/L) were measured in 116 untreated children with NHL, 66 untreated cases with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 26 cases of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). LDH levels were not significantly different in ALL and ANLL (970 vs. 817 U/L, p=.329) but the difference between ALL and NHL was highly significant with p(.001 (970 vs. 551 U/L). Among the ALL cases 95% had elevated LOH, for the group was 96% and 77% in NHL. Only 13% of NHL cases had marked elevations ()1000 U) whereas 32% and 23% of ALL and ANLL respectively did. LDH correlated directly witl1 WBC counts and was significantly higher (p=.007) in patients with high counts compared to those with low counts. Patients with diploid stemlines as determined by computerized flow cytometry had significantly higher LOH levels than those with aneuploidy (p=.001). LOH levels did not corrc>latc with or Frcn{\"h-Americ.10-Rritish cla.ssification though there was a trend to higher levels in females (p=.08) and Ll morphology (p=.06). In NHL the histiocytic type had lower mean LOH than the lymphocytic poorly differentiated (416 vs. 573 IU/L). In summary contrary to other reports LOH levels do not dis\u00b7 tinguish between ALL and ANLL, LDH is significantly higher in ALL than in NHL, LOH in histiocytic NHL is not higher. We investigated the adequacy and reliability of Asp. for cell kinetic analysis in comparison to Bx. in 74 paired simultaneously taken samples from 40 pediatric patients and the cell cycle distribution for patients with acute lymphocytic (ALL) and non lymphocytic (ANLL) leukemia. Nononuclear cells from Asp. and Bx. were separated by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient and stained with Acridine Orange (Andreeff et al Blood 55, 1980) . DNA stemline, cell cycle distribution and RNA Index (RI) were determined. Paired samples were taken before therapy and during therapy. The Bx. shows significantly higher proportion of cells in the proliferation phases (S=l0%, S+G2+M=l4%) than the Asp. (S=6%, S+G2+M=85%) with p(.001. As expected the difference in proliferation became more pronounced during chemotherapy (p=.006 before therapy, p(.001 during therapy), The cell cycle distribution was essentially the same for cases of ALL (G0/1=90.4%, S=7%, S+G2+M=9.6%) and those with ANLL (G0/1=91%, S=G.1%, S+G2+M=9%}. We conclude that bone marrow biopsies more accurately reflect the proliferative status of the bone marrow; the difference is exaggerated in patients receiving chemotherapy due to dilutional effect of peripheral blood; adequate and reproducible cell kinetic studies should be based on biopsies and not aspirates; there is no significant difference in cell cycle distribution or cell proliferation in ALL and ANLL. Nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia associated with congenital red cell pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase deficiency (PND) is characterized by abnormal elevation of red cell pyrimidine nucleotides and basophilic stippling. Studies have also demonstrated elevated erythrocyte GSH content, decreased PRPP synthetase activity and evidence of impaired glucose utilization associated with this disorder. However, at present the etiology of hemolysis in subjects with PND remains obscure. This study was performed on erythrocytes obtained from a young male confirmed as homozygous for deficiency of the enzyme via enzymatic and chromatographic techniques. Dilute suspensions of PND patient red cells were less filterable than normal cells using 3 micron pore-size filters. Anion exchange llPLC revealed an abnormally low ATP concentration accompanied by elevated CTP and UTP as well as other pyrimidine nucleotides in PND patient red cells. These cells were found to have a decrease in intracellular pH, as determined by 31P-NMR spectroscopy. Although the intracellular mag-nesium was increased, Mg-ATP, the biologically functional form of ATP, was calculated to be approximately one-half normal. Red cell calcium was normal. These studies have \u00b7further characterized both physical and metabolic defects associated with this disorder. (Supported in part by USPHS Grant 1R01ES01857). Barnett, A1 tcin-C lTgliEeY-.

Several authors have recommended the use of folinic acid (FA) in the management of patients with VCR overdose. This was based on experimental evidence in which mice given FA were protected from the lethal effects of VCR. Since the biochemical basis of FA rescue in VCR overdosage is unclear, we elected to repeat the animal experiments. Groups of 20 c 3 b 6 F 1 , hybrid mice received either al a single intravenous LD50 dose of VCR alone or the same dose of VCR followed by b) 10 daily intraperitoneal (IP) injections of FA (140 mg/kg) or cl 10 daily IP injections of normal saline (NS). The observed pattern of neuromuscular toxicity, i.e. hind leg incoordination and weakness (days 4-10) was similar in all three groups. However, 14/20 mice in group (a) died compared to 5/20 and 3/20 mice in groups (b) and (c) respectively (p<.001). In each group death occurred between days 6-11 and recovery of neuromuscular function in survivors was noted between days 12-16 following VCR. We conclude that an equal volume (0.3 cc) of daily IP NS is as effective as FA in preventing the lethal effects of VCR in mice. Survival may be related to improved hydration since survivors were noted to maintain a urine output during the observable period of toxicity (days 4-11), whereas mice who subsequently died did not. FA does not appear to be a specific antidote for VCR poisoning in mice.",

Phenolic disinfectant deterqents have been implicated in epidemics of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. A hepatic mechanism involving inhibition of qlucuronyl transferuse activity has been proposed. Two premature female infants in our intensive care nursery simultaneously developed features characteristic of Heinz body hemolytic anemia (HBHA): decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, red cell inclusion bodies (Heinz bodies), anisocytosis, fragmented cells, h_yperbilirubinemia and reticulocytosis. Laboratory investiqation failed to reveal an etiology. Epidemiologic studies indicated a possible association between the reaction and the improper use of an inappropriately high concentration of a phenolic disinfectant* to clean thP inside of the two infants' incubators. The hemolytic anemia resolved spontaneously in both infants. Extensive experimental effr.rts failed to produce Heinz bodies or HBHA. In vitro tests included incubation of the phenolic deterqent with human adult blood and qestational age matched human cord blood. Animal experiments included administration of various concentrations of the phenolic detergent by multiple (intravenous, dermal, subcutaneous and inhalation). Studies were made in cats, mice, and both intact and splenectomized rats. While we failed to prove a hemolytic reaction to phenolics, it should be considered in future epidemics of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. EBV has an unique affinity for human B lymphocytes. It is associated with infectious mononucleosis, African (endemic) Burkitt's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and an x-linked lymphoproliferative (Duncan's) disease. To better understand the nature of EBV receptors on B cells, we examined receptor expression on lymphoid leukemic cells representative of discrete stages of lymphocyte differentiation, using an immunofluorescent method. Cells were incubated with EBV, then FITC-F(ab') 2 fragments of human IgG anti-EBV membrane antigen. The proportions of each leukemic type with cells bearing EBV receptors were: ",

Patients {pts) received 14 mos of treatment in remission which included early intensification with adriamycin (Adr) and high-dose continuous infusion cytosine arabinoside (ara-c), followed by sequential combinations of Adr/ azacytidine and prednisone/mercaptopurine/methotrexate/vincristine, and late intensification with ara-c. Central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis was not included but surveillance lumbar punctures were performed. This report updates our results for the pediatric pts. Sixty-one previously untreated children with AML were entered on protocol from February 1976 to May 1980. Pts ranged in age from 3 mos to 17 years (median, 9.5 yrs). 45/61 (741) achieved CR. There have been 18 relapses (9 marrow, 8 CNS, and 1 myeloblastoma). By Kaplan-Meier analysis, the probabilities of continuous CR +/-95% confidence intervals are 55 +/-163 at 24 mos and 55 +/-23% at 36 mos. Twenty-six pts have completed treatment and 22 remain in remission with a median follow-up off therapy of 12 mos.

The ages of the children range from 8 1/2 mos. to 5 1/2 years. The diaqnosis was made on the basis of sudden drop in Hg greater than 30% of baseline, rise in reticulocyte count, and massive splenomogalv. No child experienced a solitary seouestration crisis over this period. Packed R.B.C. were given with the objective of keepinq Hb>lO gms and %S between 30-35%, and were administered as partial exchange or simple transfusion at intervals of 4-6 weeks. Three children completed the year of treatment. A splenectomy was performed on one of these children after she developed a third sequestration crisis one month after completion of transfusion therapy. The other two children have had no recurrence in 2 1/2 and 3 1/2 years post treatment. In our experience, recurrence of sequestration crisis is high, and consequently with conventional management would result in surgery for a significant number of young children. Treatment with transfusion therapy at the most will prevent surgery, and at the least will allow the young child to retain a functioning spleen for a longer period during his vulnerable years. Patients with WAS are thrombocytopenic (Tp). Their platelets (Pl) are half normal size and reported to be deficient in granules (G), dense bodies (DB) and mitochondria (M), poor in metabolic ATP and reduced in storage pool adenine nucleotides (AN). WAS Pl respond poorly to aggregating agents and have a shortened life span in patients and normal recipients. Splenectomy, however, has restored normal Pl count and volume in many WAS patients (N Eng J Med 302:892, 1980) . We have evaluated megakaryocytes (Mk) and Pl from 5 children with WAS. One patient was studied 6 times following splenectomy 3 years ago. His Pl count and volume became normal and have remained so, except during periods of infection. G, DB, M, levels of AN, capacity to form thromboxanes, 125I-labelled surface membrane glycoproteins, and responses to all aggregating agents were identical to controls. Ultrastructural features of Pl from Tp WAS patients were also normal, despite reduced size. Electron microscopy of Mk from Tp WAS patients and the non-Tp child were identical to controls. Our findings suggest that WAS Pl are intrinsically normal. Prolonged maturation in the bone marrow causing excessive development of Mkdemarcation membranes may result in small Pl size and Tp.

Decreased uptake of MTX and synthesis of increased levels of dihydrofo late reductase are two mechanisms of resistance to t1TX. Our data do not support the former as the mechanism of presumed resistance to MTX in our patients. Co-incubation of leukemic with both MTX and folinic acid (d,L,-5-CHO-H4PteGlu) resulted in a marked decrease in accumulation and polyglutamylation of MTX. This finding is similar to that described in fibroblasts. (Mal. Pharmacol. 19:87,1981) .

Of special interest is the lack of resnonse in the narietal areas 50-90 milliseconds after light stimuli, a finding which would correlate well with perceptual. motor impairment. In contrast, responses to auditory stimuli in the same areas were not affected. Whether or not these findings can be attributed to ALL therapy which includes cranial irradiation and intrathecal methotrexate is not clear. The shape and stability of the red cell (RBC) membrane is largely determined by a \"membrane skeleton\" composed of spectrin, actin and protein 4.1. To test whether defects in this structure might be responsible for HS we tested all of the known membrane skeletal protein interactions with particular attention on the previously unexplored spectrin-actin-4.1 association. HS 125!spectrin dimer (S 0 ) bound actin (A) normally in the absence of 4.1, but in 2/7 families the enhancement in S 0 to A binding normally produced by 4.1 was muted, suggesting a defect in the S 0 to 4.1 association. We examined this interaction directly in one HS kindred by precipitating the complex of HS S 0 and 125J-labeled normal 4.1 with antispectrin antibody and protein A. At saturation, S from 4/4 HS patients bound 39% less 4.1 than normal. This was not related to splenectomy or RBC age and was equally expressed in HS spectrin from fetal and adult RBCs. Scatchard analysis indicated a deficit of 4.1 binding sites on HS S 0 , but normal affinity. When chromatographed or. n column of immobilized normal 4.1 all normal S 0 was detained but 41% of So was not. This material did not interact with 4.1. In contrast, after elution the retained HS S 0 (59%) bound 4.1 normally. All other testable HS S 0 functions were normal. We conclude that HS is a genetically heterogeneous disorder. In some kindreds two populations of SQ are present, one of which is unable to bind 4.1 and binds to act1n poorly. It is likely that this is the product of the dominant gene responsible for the HS phenotype.",

The remaining pts. were prospectively randomized to an Hor NH group and they and observers rated their pain and anxiety during 1-3 baseline and 1-3 intervention procedures. The inter-rater reliability (Pearson r) between pts. and observers during 202 procedures was 0.51 for pain and 0.58 for anxie:ty, and between 2 independent observers during 22 procedures was 0.90 for pain and 0.91 for anxiety (all p<.001 ). Baseline ratings of pain and anxiety did not differ between the H and NH groups, but baseline BMA's were rated higher LP's for pain (p<.001) and anxiety (pc.01 ). Both types of behavioral intervention resulted in pain reduction for the 21 pts. who received intervention for BMA's (p<.03). However, the H group demonstrated greater pain reduction than did the NH group (pc.0001 ). Anxiety reduction during BMA's followed a similar pattern. For 17 pts. who received intervention during LP's, Hand NH were equally effective in reducing pain (pc.01) and anxiety (p\u2022.02).

Responses are age-dependent and serotype-dependent, for both the level and class of Ab Previous work with colostral lipid and lntralipid has suggested that lipid particles depress neutrophil function by exhausting metabolic substrates and decreasing availability of Fe receptors. In the current study, we examined the effect of mu 1 tilamellar vesicle (MLV) liposomes made of phosphatidyl choline, cholesterol, and phosphatidyl serine (10:5:1 ratio) on PMNL function. Small MLVs (<:lu in diameter) and large MLVs up to lOu in diameter (concentrations range from 0 to 35 mg/ml) were exposed to PMNL for Z hours prior to and immediately before assay. Zymosan stimulated hexose monophosphate shunt activity in CPM/l06PMNL (115Z + 51 control versus g89 + 50 for small MLVs and 1058 + 103 for large MLVs) was not significantly depressed in cells exposed to MLV when compared to unexposed cells. Fe receptors 88 + 1% for control versus 86 + Z% for small MLVs and 84 + 4% for large MLVs were likewise not significantly decreased. Uptake, internalization, and killing of 3H thymidine labeled S aureus 50ZA was unaffected by low concentrations of sma 11 or large MLVs. Low concentrations of liposomes do not induce defects in neutrophil function of the type seen when PMNL are exposed to colostral lipid or Intralipid. Supported by NIH grant HD13021. Several investigators have demonstrated that long-term cultures of human mononuclear cells produce functionally active C2. Human mononuclear cells were isolated by ficoll-hypaque sedimentation and cultured in RPM! or Ml99 supplemented with 15% heated fetal calf serum. C2 was measured at intervals by standard hemolytic assay. Cultures could be maintained for over 5-8 weeks with good viability of cells and C2 production. If the mononuclear cells were washed vigorously after two hours of initial incubation, the remaining adherent cells (all monocytes by nonspecific esterase staining) produced minimal CZ despite long-term cultures. If the vigorous washing was omitted, however, C2 was detected within the first two weeks and reached maximum levels at 4-5 weeks (2-10 x 108 effective molecules/culture). In a second series of experiments, non-adherent cells (lymphocytes by nonspecific esterase staining) were added to cultures of monocytes which had been thoroughly washed. Returning lymphocytes to the cultured monocytes restored their ability to synthesize CZ. The time of appearance of C2 and its maximum level was related to the number of lymphocytes added to the cultures. Cultured lymphocytes alone, however, did not produce C2. These data suggest a requirement for lymphocytes in order for cultured monocytes to synthesize C2. Whether this requirement is for a soluble lymphocyte-produced factor or for actual contact between the cells is not clear from these studies. Nevertheless, the lymphocyte appears to be a potent modulator of C2 synthesis. We report 2 new cases of Onenn's a variant of SCID, with characteristic rash, eoslnophilla and histlocytic prolifera-At age 4 rronths patient 1 had 4,216 lyrrchocytes (lcytes)/ nm of blood with 79% E-rosette+(T lcytes) and 3% surface lg+(B lcytes). Sen.111 lgG was low (49 mg/di) while lgE was increased (500 lU/ml ). Lcyte responses to mitugens were 1\"\"1, but MLC reactivity was normal. Monoclonal antibody studies using an Ortho Cytofluorograf revealed a helper/suppressor (OKT4+/0KT8+) Icyte ratio of 0.64 (nl. 1.8-3.0) and was due to an absolute increase In OKT8+ lcytes. Patient 2, at 1, 3 and 4 rronths of age had OKT4+/0KT8+ of 6.5, 2.5 and 2.3, and the fluorescence intensity of the OKT8+ population became identical to patient 1 at 4 rronths. la+ cells fell from 50% at 1 rronth to 5% at 4 rronths. There were 17.6% OKT6+ lcytes present at 4 rronths, indicating circulating stage II thyrrocytes. In 90 healthy merrbers of this highly Inbred f'\"11ily, 22 had OKT4+/0KT8+ < 1.6. Suppressor lcyte function assessed by reverse herrolytlc plaque assay revealed 70 to 80% functional suppression of normal lcytes by patient 2 but no suppression by a relative with OKT4+/0KT8+ of 1.1. Thus, Onenn's syndrome is associated with disturbed T lcyte subpopulations as tested with phenotypic markers and a functional suppressor assay; rroreover, phenotypic expression of the lcyte defect was found in an extraordinary nurber of f'\"11ily merrbers. It has been shown that stimulated T lymphocytes enhance monocyte (Mn) production of CZ in adults; in the newborn,however, the T cell population appears to be balanced towards suppression of lymphocyte (Ly) function. Since the neonate is characteristically hypocomplementemic, the role of Ly in Mn C2 production in the newborn was, therefore, investigated. Mn were harvested from adult (Ad) or umbilical cord (Co) blood by ficoll-hypaque sedimentation followed by adherence onto plastic dishes. Ad and CoMnwere cultured with or without the addition of 106 Ad or Co Ly. CZ was measured hemolytically in supernates at regular intervals. Six experiments with 4 Co and 5 Ad bloods were done. Results of representative experiments reveal: Ad Mn produce minimal CZ without added Ly (peak=0.9 x 108 effective molecules/ml culture). With Ad Ly, 4x more C2 was produced, but with Co Ly only l.Sx more CZ was generated. Co Mn, like Ad Mn, produce minimal C2 without added Ly (peak=0.3 x 108 EM/ml). When mixed with Ad Ly, 26x more C2 was produced; with Co Ly, however, only 7x more C2 was produced. Ly mixed with Mn cultures also allowed for earlier production of CZ. Ad Mn alone first produce measurable C2ond11. CZ production began 4 d earlier with Ad Ly, but only l d earlier with Co Ly. Co Mn alone first made C2 on d 17. With Ad Ly, C2 was produced 8 d earlier, but only 3 d earlier with Co Ly. These data indicate that the lymphocyte is essential for efficient production of C2 in man. The newborn lymphocyte is deficient in this function, perhaps resulting in the hypocomplementemia seen inthe newborn. Little is known about the physiology of human tissue macrophages (M$) or the process of M $activation in the human. We have shown previously that mouse MP can be primed by exposure in vitro to the bacterial products lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and muramyl dipeptide (MDP), or by injection of MDP, so that they produce more of the bactericidal agent superoxide anion co:z> when stimulated by phagocytosis or contact ::vith phorbol myristate acetate (PMA).

In 16 paired samples, PMA-stimulated 02_ release was similar with M$ from colostrum (0-3 days) or transitional milk (5-8 days) (585:!: 48 and 484\u00b1 45 nmol/mg protein, respectively, x\u00b1SEM). Release of oby milk M$ was almost identical to that by the mothers' blood monocyfes. Incubation of milk Ml> overnight with LPS, 10 ng/ml, \"activated\" the M$ for greater PMAstimulated 0-release (837\u00b138 nmol/mg, vs. 382\u00b127 for controls, n=6). Incubation wifh MOP, I-JOO ug/ml, did not activate; but incubation with the 6-0-steroyl derivative of MOP activated the M$ for greater 0release (672\u00b1 109, vs. 362 \u00b174 for controls, n=3). We conclude that breast released into both colostru:n and milk undergo a vigorous oxidative metabolic response that is equivalent to that of blood monocytes. Our data also suggest that human M$ have the capacity to be activated rapidly by exposure to certain bacterial products; this activation could enhance their capacity to resist infection. prusside, high-dose steroids and plasmaphoresis did not prevent progression of vasculitis and tissue loss. The last episode began with pain and swelling in the penis rapidly progressing to purpuric discoloration of the entire penis and base of the scrotum. Within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms, a 72 hour infusion of PGE1 was begun. The dose was increased slowly over 5 hours to a final concentration of 0.021 ug/kg/min and maintained\u00b7at that level for the remainder of the trial. The patient also received steroids. Over the next 4 days, the swelling and discoloration entirely resolved. CIC were found to be elevated (730 ug/ml) at the onset but were only minimally elevated (350 ug/ml) 5 days later. Skin flushing was noted 1 hour after the infusion was begun along with enhanced palpation of the popliteal, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries bilaterally. No other side effects were noted. We conclude that this therapeutic success was due in part to the vasodilating and antiplatelet effect of PGE 1 in preventing further vascular and tissue damage. Cell-mediated immunity was assessed in 74 children with Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA) using 2 in-vitro assays: (l)generation of Leucocyte In!\u2022ibit ion Factor (LIF) by concanavalin A (ConA) stimulated lymphocytes and (2)Lymphocyte Transfor!'lation (LT) using 4 dilutions of phytohemagglutinin and optimal doses of ConA and pokeweed mitogen. Results were analyzed by onset types of JRA and compared to results from 42 normal adults and 30 hospitalized children. In LT, abnormalities were infrequent and occurred most often when autologous rather than AB+ serum was used in the cultures. Sera from some children depressed LT in normal cells. In LIF, abnormal responses were seen in all onset types and in hospitalized children in spite of normal LT to ConA. While inflammatory disease activity contributed to this finding in the polyarticular and systemic onset groups, it did not for the children with pauciarticular disease who were relatively well, but expressed other notable immunologic abnormalities such as antinuclear antibodies and uveitis. We concluded that there was a basic difference in immune reactivity as measured by lymphokine generation in children with pauciarticular JRA compared with healthy adults. St. Christopher's Hosp. for Child., Philadelphia, PA. In syndrome a wide spectrum of immunological abnormalities from complete deficiency to almost normal cellular immune response can occur. In 4 patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome we have noted exaggerated delayed hypersensitivity skin test responses by comparison with most normal children of the same age. For this reason we studied concsnsvslin A (Con A)-inducible suppressor activity in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of 3 children (6 mos, 15 and 17 yrs) with partial DiGeorgc syndrome but without evident infection. The percentages and absolute numbers of T cells were, respectively: 20-39%, 1200-1800/mm3; 40-6o%, 1200-2200/mm3; and 50-6o%, 900-1100/mm3. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells which were preincubated with or without con A for 48 hr were incubated with equal numbers (5x104/microtiter well) of unstimulated cells in the presence of 1/2, 1/6 and 1/18 of the concentration of con A causing optimal proliferative response ss measured by 3H-thymidine uptake. No cultures containing the patients' con A-pretreated cells showed greater than 2o% suppression, whereas control con A-treated cells caused 30-9o% (usually 55-8o%) depression of 3H-thymidine uptake by the same responder cells. This relative excessive depression of suppressor activity may be secondary or may indicate selective exhaustion of T suppressor cells. It is possible, however, that fewer suppressor cells are produced either because maturation of the latter is more sensitive to deficiency of epithelial thymus or because of absence of a portion of the thymus which is more important for aaturation_of jhe suppressor cells. At 4 years of age, a female developed thrombocytopenia, anemia, lymphopenia and hepatosplenomegaly which improved following splenectomy. Liver and spleen histopathology showed typical sarcoid granulomas. From age 4 to 12 she did well except for cough and dyspnea which improved with Prednisone therapy. At age 12 following 3 recent episodes of H. influenzae sepsis, immunologic studies revealed hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG:l64 mg%, IgM:48 mg%, IgA:9 mg%, IgE:5 IU) with deficient functional antibodies but normal B-cells, 14%. Cellular immune studies showed absent delayed skin tests with normal PllA, MLC and LIF to Candida. Studies using monoclonal antibodies showed total T-cells 20% (nl 68\u00b120%), T-helper cells 13% (nl 50!10%), I-suppressor cells 34% (nl 20tl0%). C4 was decreased, 9.9 mg% (nl 17-50), but other complement components were normal. She had elevated angiotension converting enzyme, 157 (nl 80!20) despite high dose Prednisone therapy.

Eight families, including twelve patients with AT, were investigated for parameters which tested the current models of pathogenesis for this autosomal recessive disorder. We found: T cells decreased, B cells elevated, PHA responses decreased, variable T suppressor activity, serum IgA and IgG? decreased. Serum alpha fetoprotein and liver enzymes were elevated. Increased Con A capping of lymphocytes and increased cyclic nucleotides of !-lymphocytes correlated in individual patients. Chemotactic responses of neutrophils were decreased in most patients. Thymosin-a-1 levels of patients and family members did not differ from age-matched controls. Excision repair of gamma-induced DNA damage was decreased in some patients and parents. Translocation of chromosome 14q was not noted in any of our patients. Taken together, these data are not easily reconciled with any of the current hypotheses but suggest that a primary or secondary cytoskeletal disorder may underlie the pathogenesis of AT. Heterozygotes could not be reliably identified, even by multiparameter analyses. Patients with familial reticuloendotheliosis and eosinophilia (Omenn's syndrome) are reported to have variable degrees of impairment of humoral or cell-mediated immunity. We have studied three children with this syndrome; all presented in the first year of life with hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, a generalized exfoliative dermatitis, frequent infections and failure to thrive. Common to all were markedly elevated levels of IgE (>4000 ng/ml). Despite the presence of relatively normal numbers of T lymphocytes, normal !-lymphocyte subset distribution and proliferative responses to lectins and allogeneic cells in two of the patients, thymic biopsies revealed marked lymphocyte depletion and the absence of Hassall's bodies. Band T lymphocytes from all three patients were totally deficient in ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity while other cells (bone marrow, fibroblasts, granulocytes) had normal 5'-nucleotidase activity. On the other hand, lymphocyte endo-5'-nucleotidase activities and sensitivity to the addition of deoxyadenosine or deoxyguanosine were entirely normal. The failure to express ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity may reflect abnormalities in lymphocyte differentiation which accompany this syndrome or alternatively, represent the consequences of an, as yet undefined, extrinsic process. The presentation of this syndrome in one patient with a lymphoproliferative disease, another with severe combined immunodeficiency and a third with cartilage-hair hypoplasia may suggest a common pathogenctic event being expressed in susceptible individuals. Previous studies have indicated the presence of islet cell antibodies (IC-Ab) and immune complexes (IC) in insulin-dependent diabetics sera (IDD-S). Present studies describe the isolation and characterization of IC-Ab and IC. Rat pancreas islets were dispersed by Dispase, the cells cultured and tested for insulin secretion. The results obtained showed the presence of 2 types of Ab in IDD-S. Islet cell surface Ab identified by a) immunofluorescence, b) reactivity with 125!-labeled sera and immunoglobulins derived therefrom (IG) and c) reactivity with 3H-labeled cell membranes. Assays were done by measurement of 1251-IG bound to unlabeled cells, 3H-labeled cells bound to cold IG and protein concentration in the supernate. The reaction of IDn-S or JG with cells or membranes was 2-5 fold higher than those of normals. Using the soluble fraction of islet cells (SF) as Ag, the reactivity of IDn-s was linear with SF concentration, whereas the normals had no detectable activity. The Ab found in I9n-S was differentiated from anti-insulin by inhibitiyn studies. The IC was precipitated by polyethyleneglycol using 251-labeled sera and IG. The amount of ppt. from Inn samples was higher than normals. IC was identified by m.w., C1q test and dissociation into Ag and Ab.

The mean volume of milk collected from the subjects decreased to 67% of the initial volume at 4 weeks, 40% at 8 weeks, and 20% at 12 weeks. No leukocytes were detected in the milk specimens from these subjects during the study. The concentrations of lactoferrin and lysozyme remained unchanged in most of the subjects.

Three patient populations were studied: healthy infants (n=l5, B.W. 3160.7 .!:: 648.3 g, (m .!:: SD) G.A. 38.0 .!:: 2.4 wk), \"stressed\" infants (n=33, B.W. 2019.3 .!: 990.4 g, G.A. 33.5 .!:: 4. 9 wk), and healthy adults (n=22). 32 of 33 \"stressed\" infants had acute respiratory illnesses requiring mechanical ventilation. Radiolabelled type le GBS was opsonized with 596 adult serum, and incubated with PMN monolayers adherent to coverslips. Bacterial uptake was determined at O, 40, 60, and 80 minutes and expressed as cpm/106 PMNs \u2022 For all study groups, there was a significant increase in uptake with time (p<: .05). PMNs from \"stressed\" infants demonstrated enhanced bacterial uptake when compared to adults: (40 min., \"stressed\" 7670.1.!::6187.1 (m .!:: SD), adult 4972.8 .!:: 4005.7, p< .05; 60 min., \"stressed\" 10522.2 .!:: 6634.5, adult 6368.5 .!:: 3855.4, p< .OJ, 80 min., \"stressed\" 13408.4 .!:: 8046.5, adult 8750.6 .!:: 7522.7, p<\u00b0 .025. Phagocytosis was significantly greater in healthy infants vs. adults (40 min., healthy 5667.9 .!:: 4089.J, p<.05, 60 min., 9614.7 .!: 7644.7, p<.01, and 80 min., 12955.5 .!:: 8518.6, p<'..01) . There were no significant differences in bacterial uptake between \"stressed\" and healthy infants or between infants) or< 1500 grams. In conclusion, PMN phagocytosis of GBS is enhanced during the neonatal period and not adversely affected by severe stress or prematurity. Cerebral cysticercosis is the commonest cause of epilepsy in some African countries. It is also corrmon in Mexico and in areas of the United States which have large numbers of Mexican and other irrmigrants. It may involve children as well as adults and may be associated with hydrocephalus.aseptic meningitis, and cerebral calcifications of typical size and configuration.",

Five \u00b5l of serum or 20 \u00b5l of CSF were incubated overnight with an antigen coated disc and buffer to make 55 \u00b5l. After thorough washing, the disc was incubated with radiolabelled staphylococcal protein A for 3 hours. After 3 more washings the counts bound reflected IgG antibodies to C. cellulosa in the serum or CSF. An initial study involved the serum and CSF of 64 patients. All 15 patients with known cysticercosis had elevated serum IgG antibodies and most had antibodies in the CSF. Many had a selective increase in specific antibodies in the CSF, indicating specific production, or extraction, by the CNS. IgE, IgG4 and IgD antibodies were produced by most patients and were also present in the CSF, but not so consistently as total IgG antibodies. Nine of 17 patients with suspected cysticercosis and 0/32 with unrelated neurological diseases had antibodies in either serum or CSF. Cerebral cysticercosis is a virtual certainty when CSF antibodies are high. It should be suspected when serum antibodies are high and there are CNS signs. If neither fluid has antibodies the diagnosis is highly unlikely. Mast cell mediators are released during hypersensitivity episodes, associated with release or increased granulocyte, especially Eosinophil (Eos), inhibitory activity. In status asthmaticus in humans, Eos histaminase (Hx) and monocyte histamine methyl transferase activity along with plasma and urinary histamine metabolites increase. The increased Eos Hx (205\u00b132 to 741\u00b168 Units) correlated to the level of pulmonary obstruction (.'.:.20 to 65% decrease FEV 1 ). Asthmatic Eos Hx content increased (210\u00b128 to 614\u00b156 Units) by incubation with the histamine analog NaMethyl histamine (l0-1 '-l0-9 M); this analog did not affect control Eos Hx (192\u00b121 to 232\u00b125 -Units) nor the Hx assay at these concentrations. The increase Eos Hx increase was temp. (max. 40\u00b0C) time (max. 15 min.) and pH (max 7.2) dependent as well as inhibited by metabolic inhibitors. A trypsin sensitive protein component of asthmatic serum increased Eos Hx activity in a dose dependent manner 0.1-1.0 mcg/10 7 Eos; the maximum increase in asthmatic Eos (+286 Units) was twofold--the increase in control Eos (120 Units). Upon Sephadex G-200 separation this activity was found in glycoproteins of two fractions (160,000 MW and 40,000 MW); OTT reduction diminished the Hx inducing activity in both; control serum had no activity. Eos Hx activity was increased in an additive manner by histamine and the serum components. Thus, exogenous histamine and inflarrmatory proteins contribute to the increased Eos Hx. We previously demonstrated impaired T-lymphocyte colony formation (TLCF) by cord blood mononuclear cells when compared to the TLC forming capacity of adult mononuclear cells (AMC). Cocultures of irradiated AMC with CBMC results in enhanced TLCF by CBMC (284+72 colonies/plate vs. 752+78 p <0.001). A similar degree of-enhancement of TLCF is seen when a colony promoting factor (CPF) produced by PHA stimulated AMC is added to cultures of CBMC (361+98 vs. 766+138, p <0.005). CBMC do not produce CPF . CPF is not produced when AMC are treated with the monoclonal antibody OKT4 plus complement (C') prior to stimulation. Treatment of AMC with OKTB and C' does not affect the production of CPF.",

The RC-RIA was used to detect CICs in 2 pts. with thyroglobulin (Httrg)-rrediated irrrnune ccnplex glorrerulonephritis (ICGl) and in an experimantal in vitro system of pre-forrred J::ovine serum al-Wnin (BSA-anti-BSA) CICs. Preincubation of (+) CIC sarrples with the suspected (HUI'g) or known Ag (BSA) resulted in a profound inhibition of 125r Protein A binding to RCs. HUI'g decreased binding l7y 25-50% in the 2 pts. with rem m:rliated l7y Hlil'g but did not decrease binding of CICs to RCs in pts. (+) for CICs without evidence of anti-'l'g Abs. Binding was not decreased l7y preincubation with related (B-'I'g) or unrelated (BSA) Ag. BSA-anti-BSA res pre-forrred @ (3X) Ag excess were (+) in RC-RIA. Preincubation of BSA-anti-BSA res with BSA resulted in a (70%) inhibition of binding in the RC-RIA. Preincubation of the res with a related Ag (ovalbJmin) resulted in an interrrediate inhibition of binding (65.5%) but was not decreased when sarrples were preincubated with unrelated Ag. Sucrose density gradient studies confirrred the IC nature of materials reactive with the RC-RIA, and also confirrred the irechanism responsible for the inhibitor of RC-RIA activity was an Ag-specific diminution in CIC size and number. This new technique can be used to evaulate the specific Ag content of CICs detected in human sera and may be helpful in differentiating i.rmrunopathJgenic from non-i.rmrunopathJgenic CICs. A. ,Calif. We recently descril:ed a new syndrOITe of acquired T-cell imbalance in previously healthy horrosexual rren which we terrred the gay-related innuncxleficiency syndrOITe (GRID). Patients experience nultiple opportunistic infections including Pneum::x:ystis carinii pneurronia, nucosal candidiasis and cyt01Tegalovirus (CMV) infection at rrultiple sites. Profound lymphopenia and virtual elimination of the helper/inducer T cell subset as defined with ronoclonal reagents were uniform features of the syndrOITe. Despite absolute B lymphopenia, these patients had normal levels of IgG and IgM and elevated levels of IgA (rrean 2-3 times normal). We believe that this syndrOITe represents an acquired irrrnunodeficiency resulting from CMV infection which is hyperendemic in the male horrosexual population. The majority of patients developed retinal lesions which had the appearance of the cottonwool spots seen in systemic lupus erythematosus and in other disorders involving the microvasculature. We therefore rreasured circulating irrrnune carplexes in these patients with three assays (Raji-RIA, Clq-SP.'< & IgG polyethylene glycol precipitation). High levels of irrrnune carplexes were uniformly de110nstrated. These findings may account for the prominent retinopathy. Irrrnune carplexemia may result from intense antigenic stirrulation and ca.ild be involved in the pathogenesis of the innune deficient state. Concanavalin A (Con A) activates a subset of peripheral blood lymphocytes to function as suppressor cells in a variety of inununologic assays in vitro. In several autoinunune diseases, depressed suppressor cell function has been documented with this technique. We have studied 11 normal young adults and 14 patients (aged 3-18 years) with autoimmune diseases: 7 with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), 4 with dermatomyositis (DM), and 3 with Reiter's Syndrome (RS). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were incubated for 48 hours either with or without 50 mcg/ml of Con A. These cells were then added to a standard one-way mixed lymphocyte culture on day zero. Suppression of uptake of 3H-thymidine was assessed on day 6 of culture as shown in the table. In these samples, disease activity and drugs did not distinguish recognizable subgroups of patients with regard to suppressor activity. 49\u00b112 48\u00b114 30\u00b115 Group means for patients did not differ significantly fromcontrol (Student's t-test, P>0.05). In all groups except RS, Con A treated cells irradiated prior to addition to the MLC were less suppressive than those not irradiated. Our data suggest that pediatric patients with these autoimmune diseases retain activity of that subpopulation of suppressor lymphocytes stimulated by Con A. CORD BLOOD. L.K.L. Jung, R.A. Good, and S. Pahwa. Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, N.Y., N.Y., 10021 The maturational defect of human cord B lymphocytes was investigated using polyclonal B cell activators and antigens as probes for the abilities of cord B lymphocytes to proliferate and differentiate. In the presence of T dependent mitogen, pokeweed mitogen (PWM) the mononuclear cells (MC) from cord blood proliferated equally well as the adult cells. However, the cord cells could not differentiate to become immunoglobulin secreting cells (ISC) in response to PWM as did the adult cells. In contrast, in the presence of T independent mitogen, Epstein Barr virus (EBV), cord cells proliferated and differentiated into 1SC in a manner similiar to the adult cells. Antigen specific antibody response of cord cells to sheep red blood cells following in vitro sensitization of MC cultures with antigen was found to be lower than the response of adult cells, although some cord samples were found to have responses comparable to adult samples. With the addition of T cell mitogen Con A to the cell cultures at 48 hours after the initiation of cultures as a means of amplifying T cell help, the antigen specific response of the cord cells was enhanced to levels comparable to normal adult cells unstimulated by Con A, but not to those of adult cell cultures stimulated with Con A 48 hours after culture initiation. With Con A, the percentage of enhancement of the antigen specific response of cord cells was comparable to that observed in cultures of adult cells. These findings suggest that the immaturity of the B cells in cord blood may be due, at least in part, to defect of B cell subpopulation(s) which require(s) T cell help to enter into differentiative stages. A male with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCIO) chimeric with nonfunctional maternal T cells derived from a transplacental infusion who did not develop Graft vs. Host Disease, was administered a transplant of maternal marrow, depleted of T cells by differential agglutination with soybean agglutinin and sedimentation of E rosettes. A dose of 7.8xlo7 marrow cells/kg was administered. Enqraftment was first detected in non-T lymphoid populations. Thereafter E rosettes rose from 20% to 66% of an 800-1400 absolute lymphocyte count. Over 4 mos, lymphocyte transformation responses to E.coli) and allooeneic cells increased to >90% of that detected in nonnal controls: Irrmunoqlobulins, which were not detected pretransplant, increased to IgG 318mq%, IqA 35mq%, 7fimo%. In addition, the patient developed lymph nodes, appropriate isoaqqlutinins, and delayed type hypersensitivity resoonse to DNCB.

Ficol-hypaque separated human neutrophils (PMN) were stimulated with specifically prepared inrnune complexes of polio, measles. herpes simplex and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV). The presence and quantity of immune complexes were determined by radioinrnunoassay. The functional effects of neutrophil metabolites released after interaction with inrnune complexes were determined by their ability to induce smooth muscle contraction in an in-vitro system employing guinea pig ileal smooth muscle strips in a grass polygraph. Interaction of RSV immune complexes with neutrophils resulted in a significant (p<0.001) degree of smooth muscle contraction compared to RSV or antibody alone. On the other hand the interaction of neutrophils with irrmune complexes of other viruses resulted in minimal or no smooth muscle contractions (p<0.001). Various inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism were tested in the system and were observed to decrease the magnitude of smooth muscle contraction. These observations suggest that RSV specific irrmune complexes may result in the release of soluble products with potential effects on the contractility of smooth muscles in the mucosal surface. Such neutrophil factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of mucosal disease and possibly bronchospasm in RSV infection. Published studies of HC have suggested local marrmary production of IgA and IgM, not IgG. We examined HC and plasma samples from 27 postpartum women to determine if IgG, may be locally produced or selectively transferred into HC. IgG, was measured using RIA, and IgG was measured using radial immunodiffusion. The geometric mean concentrations of IgG, were 9.4 \u00b5g/ml [0.9-160] for HC and 149.7 \u00b5g/ml [21-920] for plasma, and for total IgG were 39.8 \u00b5g/ml for HC and 7658.9 \u00b5g/ml [3250-16000] for plasma. The mean IgG, HC/plasma ratia [O. ll7\u00b10.029] was 20 fold greater than the IgG HC/plasma ratio [0.006\u00b10.001]. In 16 patients, the HC/plasma ratio for IgG4 was greater than 10 times the HC/plasma ratio for total IgG, suggesting preferential local production or concentration of IgG,.",

Under normal conditions, C3 and factors B and D continuously react in the fluid phase resulting in low-grade formation of C3b and subsequent generation of the alternative pathway C3 convertase, C3bBb. Nonproductive utilization of all of the circulating C3 does not occur, however, because of two plasma inhibitors, factors Hand I. The present study has examined the control of C3 activity in the fluid phase to determine the relative roles of factors Hand I. If purified C3 and factors Band Dare mixed so as to maintain \"physiologic ratios\" of all 3 components, 80% of the C3 is utilized within 10 minutes at 370 C indicating that the utilization of C3 occurs readily in the absence of control proteins. Addition of factor Hat even 25% of this \"physiologic\" concentration, however, completely aborts C3 utilization. By contrast, factor I at 10 times the experimental concentration failed to control C3 turnover. These data indicate that factor H is the primary endogenous control protein for C3 utilization in the fluid phase and presumably acts by accelerating the decay dissociation of C3bBb with loss of factor B activity and concommitant loss of C3 reactivity. The role of factor I, therefore, would then be to control the serum level of factor B by inactivating C3b and preventing further utilization of factor B. Thus, regulation of the fluid phase of the alternative pathway may involve either factor Hor I and defective regulation involving these factors may play a major role in a variety of disorders.

Differential HLA typing of T cells,B cells and monocytes demonstrated selective engraftment of maternal-type r cells. Initial mixed lymphocyte cultures indicated that cells from the father were unresponsive to the patient's cells despite HLA-A,B,C and Dr incompatibility. Studies using primed lymphocyte typing techniques confirmed that the father's unshared HLA-0 determinant was identical to the patient's maternal HLA-0.

Engraftment of both hematopoietic and lymphoid elements was followed by full hematologic recovery and immune reconstitution. Over 18 months post transplant, the patient is clinically well, with mild chronic GvHD controlled with low dose prednisone. Thus, lethal GvHD can be reversed by immunoablative therapy and a secondary infusion of histocompatible marrow. This case also provides another rare example of discrepancies between HLA-D and HLA-Dr, and suggests that HLA-0 matchin 0 can be used to define suitably histocompatible related marrow donors. ",

The ability of leukocytes to destroy herpes simplex virus (HSV) infected cells in the of antibody (antibody-dependent cellular-cytotoxicity, AOCC) and the absence of antibody (natural killer cytotoxicity, NKC) has been correlated with the outcome of HSV infection. Anti-HSV AOCC has been reported as low or normal in cord blood, and dependent on the route of delivery. Using a 51 Cr release microcytotoxicity assay we studied the cytotoxicity to HSY-infected cells of peripheral blood lymphocytes of term babies during the first 3 months of life. Using an effector to target cell ratio of 30:1, AOCC of babies age 0-60 days (32.2+3.5, mean + SEM, n= 21) was lower (p<.001) than matched adults There was no difference between AOCC of older babies [52.2+12.8, n= 5) and adults (68.3+8.3). NKC of babies age 0-60 days [14.9+2.5) was lower (p <.001) than adults (38.8+3.3). NKC was-not significantly different in older babies (32.8+15.9) and adults (49.6+12.2). Cytotoxicity of babies' lymphocytes was lower than aduits\u2022 at all times using lower effector cell ratios. Babies' polymorphonuclear leukocyte cytotoxicity was low at all times tested. Post partum cytotoxicity did not vary with route of delivery. These data demonstrate a gradual normalization in antiviral cytotoxicity, correlating with the age at which humans become resistant to severe HSV infection. Reconstitution of these defects in the human neonate, as demonstrated in mice, may prevent severe HSY-infection. Newborn mice and humans have low antiviral natural killer cytotoxicity and are unusually susceptible to severe HSV infection. Newborn C57Bl/6 mice were protected by a combination of IFN and MC (32% survival, p<.001} but neither alone when given i.p. one day prior to a 100% lethal i.p. HSV infection. The effective dose of IFN (100-10 units), MC number (5x106 to 5x105) and active MC (lymphocyte or monocyte but not polymorphonuclear leukocyte) was determined. Protection did not depend on the anti-HSV immune status of the MC donor. Treatment of mice with IFN and MC after infection did not affect the outcome. WISH cells are human fibroblasts that secrete an IFN induced antiviral protein in vitro. Protection by WISH cells and IFN {55% survival, p<.001} suggested IFN induced cross species antiviral protein production in vivo.",

Human cutaneous LPR are characterized histologically by mixed cellular infiltrates; immunofluorescent analyses suggest that immunoglobulin and complement deposition do not play a significant role in either initiating or propagating these reactions. To better establish the role complement plays in the genesis of LPR, Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g}, known to produce LPR following skin testing with either rabbit anti-rat IgE or isolated mast cell granules (MCG), were depleted of serum complement. Cobra venom factor (CVF} (200 units/kg. n = 5) or saline (n = 4) was injected IV; CH and hemolytic c 1 titers, WBC counts and differentials were at 0, 6, ana 30 hrs following injection. Compared to controls, CVF-treated rats demonstrated a rise in total WBC counts (p < .01) and absolute neutrophil counts {p < .01} at both 6 and 24 hrs following treatment. CH 50 titers in CVF-treated rats decreased from 220 \u00b1 20 units/ml at baseline to < 1 unit /ml at 6 and 30 hrs. c 3 titers in CVF-treated rats were < 10 units/ml compared to 50,575 \u00b1 l,070 units/ml in controls.

Thus, complement depletion does not affect the normal expression of rodent LPR. \"'e are testing the hypothesis that the immune complexes which are frequently present in CF inhibit antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or deplete the K cells which mediate ADCC by binding to their receptors for the Fe portion of IgG (FcR). It was expected that the function of other R:R-bearing cells such as NK cells would be less affected, but preliminary results reveal greater suppression of NK cells. The activity and numbers of functioning NK and K cells among peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MC) were assayed in 12 CF patients and in normal adults and non-CF pulmonary patients. Release of Cr from labeled K562 human leukemia cells or antibody-coated P815 mouse mastocytoma cells was measured at lymphocyte-to-target ratios of 5:1 to 40:1. Cytotoxic lymphocytes were counted as those conjugated with trypan blue-staining target cells after a 1 :1 mixture of MC and the same target cells was incubated in soft agarose. NK activity and/or % of NK cells were markedly depressed in 10/12 patients. Six of those with depressed NK cells had normal K cells. Other data suggest that the pulmonary infP.ction in Cr' is responsible for the observed deficiency in NK cells, and it is postulated that the latter contributes to the intensity of CF ex-\u00b7acerbations due to viral infections. The dissociation of NK and K cell activity in some of these patients is confirmatory of our other data indicating that NK cells are distinct from K cells. Of particular importance is the finding that rubella virus was recovered from the nasopharynx in 56% of breast feeding infants.

Epidemiologic and clinical features of Kawasaki syndrome (K.S.) suggest a possible infectious etiology while pathologically K.S. appears to be a vasculitis of medium sized arteries. To determine what role circulating il1'1lune complexes (CICs) might play in K.S., the sera of 42 patients with K.S. were tested for CICs by the Raji cell radioimmunoassay (RC-RIA) and Clq solid phase assay (Clq-SPA). Overall 29 patients (59%) were positive by or both assays; 22 (52%) by RC-RIA and 20 (48%) by Clq-SPA. CICs were detected as early as 2 days and as late as 35 days of illness. Clinical data was available for 32 of the patients. An established clinical scoring system was used to estimate severity of disease. No correlation was found between disease severity and incidence or concentration of CICs found. four patients had coronary artery aneurisms (CAA) detected by 2 dimensional echocardiography and confirmed by angiography. The Two recombinant DNA produced Hu JFNa preparations (A and D) were evaluated to detect their invnunoregulatory effect on oxidative metabolism and functional activities of PMNL. Ficoll-Hypaque separated PMNL from blood of healthy volunteers were incubated with five concentrations of HulFNa ranging from 125 to 5000 IU/ml. Utilization of l-14c glucose by resting PMNL was significantly (p<0.05) greater after incubation with 500 JU/ml of Hu!FN when compared to control cells or PMNL incubated with 125, 250, 1000, or 5000 JU/ml. There was no significant difference in l-14c glucose oxidation or in oxygen consumption by zymosan stimulated PMNL exposed to the various concentrations of both Hu!NFa preparations when compared to control cells. No significant difference in uptake, internalization or killing of 3H methyl thymidine labeled S. aureus by PMNL incubated with interferon at 250, 500, or 1000 JU/ml was detected when compared to contro 1 PMNL. I FN-A had no effect on non antibody-mediated killing of Herpes simplex virus infected target cells in a 5lcR release cytotoxicity assay. These data suggest that the two HuIFNo. preparations tested had little effect on the oxidative metabolism, antiviral natural killer cytotoxicity, or uptake and killing of radiolabeled S. aureus by human PMNL. Few neutrophil specific antigens (NA), (NA1,NA2, NBl, NCl) of paternal origin have been shown to be responsible for the stimulation of maternal antibodies (Ab), which crossed the placenta and destroyed the neutrophils (PMN) causing neonatal neutropenia (NN). In order to evaluate the nature of NN and to understand the involvement of various NA we systematically investigated several cases of NN with and without infection. EDTA-microagglutination and indirect immunofluorescent assays were used to detect Ab. We identified 4 Ab that specifically agglutinated PMN from the father. No maternal auto-agglutinins were detected. We were successful in obtaining blood samples from one of the 4 neonates and identified Ab in the serum. PMN from this patient also was agglutinated by the maternal Ab. These Ab also agglutinated PMN from normal donors of known NA phenotype ranging from 5-40%. But no correlation was found with the pattern of reactivity with the already known NA apparently identifying new antigenic .'pecificities. The NN persisted from 2-5 wks. In follow-up studies we found that in one of the 4 mothers, the Ab dissappeared at 3 mos. In the other 3 cases, the Ab persisted even after 5-9 mos. of delivery. Thus \u2022. investigations of the irrmune destruction of PMN in NN not only is U$eful in evaluating the causes of neutropenia but also to identify characterize the polymorphic NA. Lymphocyte stimulation is coDDDonly used for measuring cellmediated iDDDunity in suspect ioununodeficiency and for examining the effects of serum factors or potentially toxic drugs on lymphocyte 3 function. The assays most coounonly used employ the uptake of H-thymidine(UT) to quantitate mitogen or antigen induced stimulation. This method, however, does not allow analysis of mechanisms for suppression. We compared UT to flow cytometric analysis(FCA) using a Coulter TPS-1 Cell Sorter. Parametric, and non-parametric analysis of DNA fluorescence histograms provided the data base. Antiviral agents previously shown to suppress CMI were examined as well as serum inhibitors such as free fatty acids (FFA). FCA was a more rapid and reproducible method as compared to UT. In addition, FCA revealed blocks at various stages of cell cycling for antiviral agents. Some purine and pyrimidine analogues produced enzymatic blocks at the late synthetic(S) or G 2 and M phase or interfered with late replication resulting in a buildup in the S phase. The antiviral thymidine analogue BVDU at low concentrations suppressed UT which was not the case with FCA; at higher concentrations, a block in G 2 or M resulted. Ara C, FFA, and serum from leukemic children produced lysis of lymphocytes during early cycling. Flow cytometry appears to be a sensitive and useful method for delineating mechanisms of iDDDunotoxicity.

In this study, we evaluated the immunoprotective quality of specific anti-CT BCI fed to infant rabbits. Method: 3-5 day old infant rabbits were fed 9 ml in 24 hr. of anti-CT (immune) BCI (3.1 mg anti-CT/100 mg IgG1). Control groups were similarly fed non-immune BCI or D5W. After completion of feedings, all animals were anesthetized. The distal ileum of each animal was ligated and inoculated with 100 ng of CT. Some animals were injected with I cc of saline as negative controls. 18 hours after injection of CT, mortality rates were noted. The fluid accumulation index (FAI=gm fluid/gm intestine) was calculated on surviving animals. The mortality rate of immune BCI-fed rabbits is the same as saline-injected controls, and less than non-immune BCI and D5W-fed controls (p<0.01). The FAI of immune-fed animals is less than non-immune and D5W-fed controls (p<0.01). This study clearly shows the potential benefit of orally administered specific bovine colostral immunoglobulins in the prevention of enteric disease. The orientation (chemotaxis) and locomotion (chemokinesis) of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) are controlled by an internal movement mechanism (involving active cytoplasmic movement) and are influenced by external environmental and ionic conditions. We have studied the degree to which the orientation and movement mechanisms of PMNs are self-contained (built-in) within the cell and the degree to which they are under membrane control. Cells were partially demembranated by treatment with the non-ionic detergent octylphenoxyl-polyethoxyethanol (Triton-X-100), thus providing small openings in the membrane through which ATP and necessary ions could achieve unrestricted passage. Upon contact with Triton-X-100, PMNs became spherical and acquired a very compact and rigid morphology. Addition of ATP to the media was followed by activation of the PMNs to motile cells with active cytoplasmic extension and pseudopod formation. Although these PMNs actively locomoted, they did not respond to a chemotactic oradient. Thus, the activation process restored physical movement parameters, but did not re-establish the orientational capacity of live PMNs. Tritonated models of human cord blood PMNs were reactivated and compared with similar studies of adult PMNs. Optimal movement and locomotion attained in the reactivation were identical to that of adult PMNs. Similar to reactivated adult PMNs, cord PMNs did not respond chemotactically or chemokinetically to chemoattractants. The data thus establish that the chemotactic deficiency of cord PMNs is membrane-associated and reflects a developmental functional abnormality of the membrane during ontogeny.",

The presence of significant numbers of virulent revertants (ca. 10-7) in such vaccines has orecluded their use in man. We have-overcome this problem by constructing a strain of H.influenzae containing 3 attenuating ts mutations of identical phenotype, thus reducing the reversion rate to levels (<l0-21). The technical difficulties associated with the combination of mutations of identical phenotype have been solved by linkage of the mutations to selectable chromosomal markers. We have transferred two of the attenuating lesions into an erKapsulated type b strain which remains completely viable at 360C, without replicating, for at least 24 hours. Studies with single ts mutants of P.aoruginosa have demonstrated the efficacy of such strains in inducing Protection from challenge with lOOLD50 of the virulent wild-type, for up to 5 weeks after intraperitoneal immunization of mice. The protection induced is specific for the immunotype of the ts strain, and is quantitatively better than that induced by the heat-killed preparations of either the ts or wild-type strains. The results sunest tMt this anproach may be considered for potential use in human beings.

T-cells, r,-10 column passed PBL, and NK and ADCC enriched subpopulations from a Percoll gradient precultured with AMB also manifest decreased NK and ADCC activities, and this effect is not reversed by indomethacin. Further, PBL precultured with AMB also show decreased levels of immunoglobulin (lgG) synthesis and secretion in response to polyclonal stimulation of Bcel ls by pokeweed mitogen.

Michael Osband and Menachem Shlesinger, Boston U. Med. Ctr., Dept. of Pediatrics, Boston, MA 02118 (Spon. by Joel Alpert) The previously proven existence of distinct lymphocyte subpopulations bearing either Hl or H2 type histamine receptors raises the question of their role in imrnunoregulation. Therefore, we studied the effect of histamine and its agonists/antagonists on immunoglobulin (lg) synthesis by human and mouse lymphocytes. We found that histamine at low concentrations (<10-8M) binds predominately to the more affinite HI receptor and increases lg synthe\u00b7sis. This effect is blocked by diphenhydramine, an HI antagonist, but not by cimetidine, an HZ blocker. Histamine at high concentrations (>10-SM), binds predominantly to the less affinite but more numerous H2 receptor and suppresses lg synthesis. This effect is blocked by cimetidine but not by diphenhydramine. The HI agonises, 2-pyrid;\u2022lethylamine and 2-thiazolylethylamine, increase lg synthesis, while the H2 agonises, dimaprit and 4-methylhistamine, suppress it. Xoreover, when lymphocytes are sorted and subsequently studied for their effect on lg synthesis of autologous lymphocytes, we found that HIR+ cells (those bearing HI receptors) are helper cells, while H2R+ cells are suppressor cells (decrease synthesi\"). These data suggest a dual feedback mechanism by which histamine, released during an imr.1une response, can regulate the immune system. When the released histamine is at low concentration, it activates HlR+ helper cells and amplifies the immune response. This, in turn, causes even greater histamine release which can bind to H2R+ suppressor cells resulting in immuno- Investigations of _i!! vitro humoral immune responses were done in a pair of identical twins with AT, both lgA deficient. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) failed to generate inmunoglobulin secreting cells (!SC) as quantitated in a reverse hemolytic plaque assay following stimulation of PBM cultures with pokeweed mitogen (PWM) which is a T-dependent stimulus. In contrast, stimulation with Epstein Barr virus, a T-independent stimulus, resulted in adequate !SC responses, but with secretion of only IgG and IgM and not IgA. In an antigen-specific assay in which anti-SRBC antibody secreting cells are quantitated in a direct hemolytic plaque assay following in vitro sensitization of PBM cultures with SRBC antigen, no responses were elicited even after maneuvers aimed at amplifying T-cell help in the cultures. PWM induced !SC responses of B-cell enriched cultures were only partially reconstituted by providing allogeneic T helper cells. T-enriched populations from the patients did not manifest immunoregulatory abnormalities. The autologous mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR) between patients' own T and non-T cells was grossly defective, but their T and non-T cells functioned adequately as responders and stimulators in allogeneic MLR. The findings in these 2 patients with AT are suggestive of 1) intrinsic B cell dysfunction and 2) defective interaction between T and non-T cell populations. The observed B cell dysfunction might result from the lack of a B-cell subset or an immaturity of the B-cell pool. E.M. Smithwick and R.A. Good, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, lmmunobiology Section, New York, N.Y. 10021 Six patients with CMC were investigated for antibody production in vitro in polyclonal and antigen-specific assay systems. Cultures---ci1'Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) differentiated poorly into immunoglobulin secreting cells as tested in a reverse hemolytic plaque assay using protein A coated sheep erythrocytes, following stimulation of PBM cultures with either pokeweed mitogen, a T-dependent stimulus or with Epstein Barr virus, a T-independent stimulus. Cocultures of isolated T and B cells from patients and normal volunteers revealed the defect to be intrinsic to B cells, although associated abnormalities of increased suppressor cell activity were frequently present. T helper function was adequate in all patients. Antibody responses to sheep red blood cell (SRBC) determinants, tested for by quantitating anti-SRBC plaque forming cells following in vitro sensitization of PBM cultures with antigen, were found normal in 2 and decreased in 3 patients. In the latter patients the responses were augmented following delayed addition of the T cell mitogen Con A to the cultures as a means of amplifying T cell help. In one patient with associated hypogammaglobulinemia, no responses were elicited despite these manipulations. These findings indicate that 1) abnormalities of in vitro humeral immune function are frequently present in CMC besides the described defects of cell mediated immunity, and 2) polyclonal and antigen-specific responses might be mediated by different activation mechanisms, possibly involving distinct B cell subsets. Human T-lymphocytes (TL) generate chemiluminescence (CL) in the presence of luminol. We investigated this phenomenon in terms of age dependency, nature of oxidants produced and relationship to cellular immune competence. Sixteen adult and 8 cord rosette purified TL preparations purity) were tested for spontaneous and concanavalin A (Con-A) stimulated CL. The chemiluminescence index (CI) is an expression of peak photon emission, adjusted for luminol drift and the spontaneous emission of a dark adapted blank. Mean spontaneous CI was 88 \u00b1 23 in adults and 19 \u00b1 9 in cords, p<O.l. Con A stimulated mean Cl was 113 \u00b1JO in adults and 23 + 10 in cord TL preparations, p<.05. i\u2022iean specific CI, an exof the difference between mitogen and spontaneous peak emission was 25 + 8.0 in adults and 3.6 + 1.4 in cords, p<O.l. No difference in ti;;;e to peak response or Cl at the initial measurement point (2.8 \u00b1 0.4 in adults vs. 3.5 \u00b1 0.6 in cords p<0.4), was noted. Treatment of adult TL preparations with superoxide dismutase augmented CL a mean 120% over non-treated controls. This ef fect was dose restricted, peaking at 7.5 ug. Catalase treatment at all doses tested resulted in a mean diminution in total CL of 50%, implicating 11 2 0 2 as a critical oxidant in this response. CL was tested in a patient with profound cellular immunodeficiency (SCIO) a fetal thymus reconstituted chimera and age-matched control. All 3 subjects demonstrated normal granulocyte CL to zymosan opsonization. TL-specific CI was 52 in the control, 7.6 in the chimera and 0.9 in the SCIO. This suggests a possible role for CL in the rapid evaluation of TL functional metabolic integrity. table) was significantly greater(p<.003) in the SGA preterm than in the SGA term infant and similarly responses were greater(p<.04)in the AGA preterm than in the AGA term infant. Among the preterm infants the SGA responses were significantly greater(p<.02)than the AGA but there was no difference between the two groups at term. The increased PFC responses observed in the preterm SGA infants may be due to decreased suppressor T cell function or to the differentiation of B cells in vivo to a more mature state that is responsive to activatiof!i-;:;-vJ:tro by PWM. The increased perinatal morbidity observed in these infants may be responsible for this B cell maturation. During the past three years, four of the fifteen severe combined immunodeficiency patients referred to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center for diagnostic evaluation and possible therapeutic bone marrow transplantation were determined to have intrauterine derived maternal T lymphocytes. The maternal cells in all cases were identified solely by HLA typing techniques since the cells did not have mitotic responses to mitogen stimulation and could not be evaluated by cytogenetic methods. In three of the cases, the maternal cells were homozygous for HLA-A,B and/or DR locus determinants. The engrafted cells were E-rosette and DR positive, slg, Leu-1, Leu-2, and Leu-3 negative, and weakly positive for the Leu-4 T-cell antigen. The cells were functionally inactive in in vitro tests and, despite the fact that the patients were examined repeatedly between the ages of 6 months and 15 months, 3 of the 4 patients had complete absence of any evidence for clinical graft vs. host disease. These findings suggest that variations in the clinical expression of severe immunodeficiency may reflect variations in clinical effects of maternally derived cells and that the phenomenon of such engraftment apparently occurs with significant frequency. It is also important to note that awareness of this phenomenon allowed identification of an HLA genotypically identical sibling marrow donor for one of the patients who had previously been thought to lack this therapeutic option. Stimulated lymphocytes and lymphokines induce PA secretion by human monocytes. The object of these studies was to determine whether measurement of enzyme induction could be a useful measure of cell-mediated immunity (CMI). Mononuclear leukocytes (MNL) from adults or children were cultured in the presence or absence of phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A or candida antigen. After 1 to 4 days PA activity of the monocytes in the MNL was determined using a micro fibrin plate assay.",

Despite large numbers of circulating T and B lymphocytes, there was no response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and lymphocyte 5' nucleotidase (5' NT) was undetectable. The dermal and hematologic abnormalities resolved rapidly with cytoxic therapy. After developing a persistent parainfluenza URI and stopping prednisone, the original clinical findings recurred at age 6-7 mo. HLA typing of E-rosette separated lymphocytes now demonstrated that the T cells had only maternal antigens. PHA stimulated cells were 46XX (22/30) and 46XY (8/30). Bone marrow cells were all XY and RBS were of host type. Blastogenic responses increased to PHA (SI=208:1) and candida antigen (SI=5:1). Lymphocyte 5'NT did not change. However, nasal excretion of parainfluenza persisted and chronic rotavirus enteritis lead to severe malabsorption. Production of oligoclonal IgM (763 mg/dl) and IgG was noted at 19 mo. The patient developed S. aureus sepsis and succumbed to pneumonia at 20 mo.",

            "text": "Intrauterine lymphoid engraftment in SCID, clinically inapparent in most patients, has caused GVH. Our patient is the first to have developed T lymphocyte function and immunoglobulin production. This potential for reconstitution makes the detection of T cell chimerism important in SCID and in histiocytosis X. Although it is known that blood basophils may enter areas of inflammation in an immunologically specific manner, knowledge of factors that control this phenomenon is incomplete. Since uropod formation is closely associated with translational movement in some types of cells, control of this feature might be important in cell traffic. Previous work showed that low concentrations of serum stimulated uropod formation in basophils. We have isolated a factor (UIP) from human serum that inhibits uropod formation in guinea pig basophils. In RPMI-1640 alone, uropod bearing basophils were 59\u00b19% (mean \u00b1 SD) and 6\u00b14% in the presence of UIP + phosphatidyl choline. Phosphatidyl choline was a necessary cofactor for the action of purified UIP. In addition, this factor inhibits in vitro human basophil chemotaxis to C5a. The association of UIP with the low density lipoproteins (LDL) was utilized in the initial purification of UIP. Further purification of UIP was accomplished by isoelectric focusing. Proteins with uropod inhibitory activity had isoelectric points between 7.9 and 8.2. SDS-PAGE of the proteins prepared by isoelectric focusing demonstrated two bands which corres?ond to molecular weights of 45,000 and 50,000 daltons. These proteins appear identical to UIP previously described for T lymphocytes. Monospecific antisera to these proteins removes the uropod inhibitory activity for both basophils and lymphocytes. The finding of factors in serum that both stimulate and inhibit uropod formation in basophils suggests that a control system for basophil movement may exist in serum. \u2022 Murine interferon activates suppressor T cells which produce soluble immune response suppressor (SIRS), a lymphokine which inhibits immune responses by murine lymphoid cells. We investigated whether human leukocyte interferon (IFNa) acts by a similar mechanism. IFNaA(IFLrA-kindly provided by Hoffman-LaRoche, Inc.), at doses >200 units/ml, caused 090% suppression of plaque forming cell (PFC) responses by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated with pokeweed mitogen (PWM). Suppression was not significant before day 6 and peaked at 'days 7-8, suggesting stimulation of a suppressor cell by IFNaA. Small numbers of PBHC incubated with IFNaA for 24 hrs. suppressed PFC responses by 80% compared to cells incubated with inactive IFNaA when added to fresh autologous PBMC at culture initiation. Concentration of lgM in culture fluids on day 6 and 7 was suppressed >50% by IFNaA at doses >200 units/ml. Suppression of 3H-thymidine incorporation in mixed lymphocyte responses (MLR) was not significant on day 4 and peaked at 50% on day 5. IFNaA and IFNaA-activated cells did not suppress PFC responses in the presence of catalase or 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME), and MLR was not suppressed in the presence of 2-ME and dithiothreitol (OTT). Delayed onset of suppression, activation of a suppressor cell, and reversal by catalase, 2-ME and OTT suggest that human IFNaA activates a suppressor pathway analogous to that activated by interferon in murine cells and suggest that a SIRS-like mediator may be involved. In previous studies, we demonstrated that opsonic antibody (Ab) is effective in altering the course of group B streptococcal infection in humans and in a neonatal animal model. Although high titer human serum or whole blood afforded excellent protection, the available conrnercial ganrnaglobulin preparations are less satisfactory. In the present studies, we prepared mouse type-specific hybridoma Ab and examined it for protective efficacy against four strains of type Ill group B streptococci. fjeonatal rats received 5xlo6 organisms by intraperitoneal injection. Type specific hybridoma Ab (0.25 ml/kg) was administered in a separate IP injection. The survival rate of the animals receiving Ab vs controls was: l) 58% VS 3%; 2) 74% VS 36%; 3) 95% VS 0%; 4) 86% VS 9%. Significant protection was provided when hybridoma Ab was administered as late as 12 hrs postinfection (25% vs 0%; p<0.0005), an interval at which ganrnaglobulin gave no protection. In spite of the fact that the hybridoma Ab was of the IgM class, it also protected against respiratory infection. When inoculation was via the intranasal route, survival of Ab treated animals remained significant (94% vs 0%). The hybridoma type Ill specific Ab did not protect against type II group B streptococci. These studies indicate that monoclonal antibody preparations could provide a reliable source of large quantities of opsonic Ab for passive immunotherapy of neonatal group B streptococcal disease. The release of histamine from human basophils induced by Sendai virus, a parainfluenza virus which had been adapted to a human (HEp-2) epithelial cell line, was investigated in vitro. Dilutions of a stock suspension of virus were incubated with washed suspen-si0ns of human peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) for 2 min at 37\u00b0; either buffer or phosphatidyl serine (PS) at 10 \u00b5g/ml was added and the incubation continued for an additional 10 min at 37oc. Controls included buffer and uninfected HEp-2 cells. Histamine released into the supernatants was measured using an enzymatic isotopic assay and was expressed as net percentage released above buffer controls.

Two of the eight patients with pulmonary function abnormalities showed improvement in response to inhaled bronchodilator; one of these had a family history of asthma. We conclude that children with immunodeficiency who have repeated pulmonary infections are likely to develop pulmonary function abnormalities. However, immunodeficiency without pulmonary infection does not necessarily predispose to abnormal lung function. Bronchodilator therapy might benefit some of these patients, especially those with a family history of asthma. Different inrnunoprophylactic regimens have been proposed to overcome or prevent Pseudomonas lung infection in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Although current vaccines generate excellent serum antibody responses, they have changed neither the clinical status nor Pseudomonas colonization. In the present studies, lung lavage fluids were studied in mice following Pseudomonas aerosol challenge with either the oarental (lmmunotype I) or TS mutant strains. The cellular resoonses were auantitatively and aualitatively similar in both immunized and non-inrnunized animals. Protection was induced in mice receiving a single aerosol dose of 2-4 x 105 colony forming units of TS mutant of P.aeruginosa. The results sugqest that this orotection may be a result of the oresence of local opsrinizing antibodies. Since recent oublications have shown impaired opscnizing activity of serum IgG from CF patients, the present results also suggest that local immunization of the resoiratory tract might be oreferable in these patients. Neuro \u2022 Br., NINCDS, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20205 Gaucher's disease is a lipid storage disorder characterized by a deficiency of glucocerebrosidase and the accumulation of its substrate, glucocerebroside in cells believed to belong to the monocyte-macrophage system. In the present study, we evaluated cellular and humoral immunity in 30 patients (pts) with Type l Gaucher's disease. 9/30 pts bad lympbopenia and/or monocytopenia, although cell surface marker studies revealed normal percentages of peripheral T and B lymphocytes. Skin testing with candida, tetanus and mumps antigens yielded positive responses only in 1/29, 15/20 and 0/13 pts respectively. In addition, in vitro lymphocyte proliferation studies revealed further evidence of a cellular immune defect in that the pts' lymphocytes showed abnormal responses to concanaval in-A (1 /2 normal), pokeweed (1 /3 normal), streptokinase-streptodornase(l/4 normal) and candida{l/3 normal). In contrast,humoral immunity was intact. Isohemagglutinin titers, quantitative serum immunoglobulins and antibody response to primary immunization with pneumococcal polysaccharide antigen were normal. We also evaluated monocyte-mediated antibodydependent cytotoxicity and found it normal in 12 pts tested. The apparent cellular immune defects did not correlate with clinical severity of disease, splenectomy, serum triglyceride or alpha globulin levels. In summary,our data indicate that there is a defect in cellular immunity in pts with Gaucher's disease. Further studies are underway to determine its mechanism. Anergy and secondary infections during viral illnesses suggest the presence of acquired cellular and/or humoral defects. Weanling strain 2 guinea pigs were inoculated with gpCMV-infected or uninfected control gujnea pig fetal tissue culture cells. Four infected (I) and 3 control (C) animals were studied daily (x 10) and results were compared by the t-test. All (I) became viremic and shed virus from the nasopharynx. Concurrent with viremia but not with shedding, there was a 51% reduction in neutrophil directed migration towards C5a (p 0.001), and a 77% reduction in the chemotactic activity of activated plasma (p 0.001). Neutrophil random migration, monocyte random migration and monocyte directed migration were unaffected. Heated plasma from (I), incubated with normal C5a or normal neutrophils, inhibited both CSa activity and neutrophil directed migration. Three inhibitory components, designated as gpCMV-Associated-Chemotactic-Inhibitor (MW \"' 80,000), Helper 1 (MW\"' 30,000) and Helper 2 (MW \"' 15,000), were identified by gel column chromatography. The chemotacticactivity of C5a was inhibited following its incubation with either Inhibitor+Helper 1 or Inhibitor+Helper 2. The directed migration of neutrophils was inhibited following their incubation with In-hibitor+!lelper 2, but not with Inhibitor+Helper 1. No inhibition was seen following their incubation with any of the components alone or with Helper l+Helper 2. The inhibitors therefore affect- Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infectious mononuclec;is (IM) is a lymphoproliferative disorder in which infected B cells are transformed and cellular immunity is depressed. To study the changes in cellular immunity during childhood EBV IM we measured helper (T4) and suppressor T cells using monoclonal antibodies during the course of the illness and in normal children. The EBV IM illness was diagnosed by clinical, hematologic and serologic criteria. All the children had VCA-IgM antibodies, but only 2 of 11 bad heterophile antibodies.",

In the acute stage the children had less lymphocytosis than an adult group studied, probably reflecting the less marked suppressor T cell response in children, 41%, compared to adults, (p< .05).

These results are consistent with a lack of previous exposure to influenza virus and/or immaturity of the newborn immune system. In each of two cases where it was examined, however, cocultures of irradiated cord blood T cells (1200R) with allogeneic adult B cells produced anti-influenza virus antibody when stimulated with A/Aichi.

PMN dysfunction occurs during early stages of IAV infection. We have found that incubation of PMNs with unopsonized IAV causes depressed metabolic responses to particulate and soluble stimuli and decreased bactericidal activity. Additionally, attachment and ingestion of IAV directly stimulated the respiratory burst; this could cause the subsequent PMN dysfunction (e.g., by exhausting the cell or by loss of normal membrane receptor function). These possibilities were studied using 3 infective types of IAV, non-infective IAV and purified IAV glycoprotein incorporated into liposomes, Infective (Texas 77, X-31, X-47) and non-infective X-47 virus, respectively, stimulated varying peak chemiluminescent (CL) responses to 15x, 6x, 3x and 3x that of cells in buffer alone. Incubation of PMNs with each type of virus for 30 min caused similar (-65%) depression of CL responses to receptor dependent and independent stimuli (zymosan, PMA or ionophore A23187), A similar degree of PMN dysfunction was observed when PMNs were incubated with X-47 virus for 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 6 and 18 hours, Also, although liposomes stimulated CL (to lOx cells in buffer), incubation with liposomes did not inhibit later CL responsiveness to the above stimuli, The data indicate that the ability of IAV to depress metabolic responses of PMNs is: a) independent of direct netabolic stimulation of the PMNs by IAV (is not due to PMN \"exhaustion\") and b) independent of alteration of PMN receptors.",

Laboratory studies included detection of antibodies to VZV by FAMA and IAHA assays and for selected sera by ADCC and neutralization assays. In vitro lymphocyte proliferation to VZV antigens was done on peripheral blood of OKA-RIT-SK and KMcC vaccinees. The pathophysiology of Hib pneumonia is poorly understood and may be related to the host's nutritional status. Using .'l weanling rat model, pneumonia was produced by intratracheal installation of 105 Hib cells into control and iron deficient animals. The kinetics of pulmonary, blood, and splenic clearance were determined by quantitative bacteriology. Capsular antigenemia and antibody response were measured by CIE and an enzyme linked radioirranunoassay, respectively. Bacteremia was detected as early as 12 hours and as late as 12 days after inoculation with peak levels occurring between days 3 and 5 and coincided with gross and histologic evidence of pneumonia. Similarly, lung bacterial counts progressively increased reaching 10 7 -10 8 per gram of lung tissue within 72 hours and slowly decreased with positive lung cultures still present up to 24 days post infection. In Employing the techniques of immunofluorescence, neutralization of tissue culture infectivity and dermal response to VZV antigen, the development of VZV specific immune response and evolution of infection was studied in a population of infants under one year of age during outbreaks of varicella in a semiclosed domiciliary institution for infants in Japan. over a period of four years, 250 residentsranging in age from 27 days to 32 months were tested for cutaneous reactivity to VZV antigen, and VZV specific antibody activity before, during and after each outbreak of varicella. Of these, 85 subjects developed clinical varicella, with an overall attack rate of 100% for all susceptible subjects. Significantly, however, all infants under two months of age were infected following such exposure, despite the presence of pre-existing maternal antibody. The degree of cutaneous involvement appeared to be milder (<20 vesicles) in infants less than two months old and severe cutaneous disease (with over 300 eruptions or confluent rash) occurreC:: ITK>re frequently in subjects 2 to 11 ITK>nths of age. Pre-existing antibody did not prevent development of illness, or alter the degree of antibody or cellular irranune response to subsequent infection. However, the peak cutaneous reactivity to VZV antigen after infection was found to be significantly lower in infants under two months of age. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection has been associated with altered host defense and an increased susceptibility to infections. In a murine model, we demonstrated previously an impaired inflarrmatory response to a subcutaneous challenge with Kl E. coli during the acute phase of a sublethal murine CMV (MCRV)\"\"\"lnfection. To further define altered neutrophil function, we examined absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) in peripheral blood and in a subcutaneous sponge and the chemotactic ability of neutrophils in the sponge during MCMV infection. Results indicated that ANC in the sponge, but not the peripheral blood, were markedly decreased and neutrophil chemotaxis was depressed on days 1-4. For example, on days 1-2 the following mean values were obtained in MCMV-infected and sham-inoculated mice: peripheral blood ANC of 732 vs 899 (P=0.3), sponge fluid ANC of 1655 vs 5175 (P=0.001), and sponge fluid neutrophil chemotactic index of 1.9 vs 6.2 (P=0.004). These results indicate that the chemotactic ability of neutrophils migrating into subcutaneous tissues of mice is impaired during acute MCMV infection, and strongly suggest that impaired migration of cells from the peripheral blood is at least one mechanism accounting for decreased numbers of neutrophils in tissues. These alterations in host defense may be important in contributing to the development of CMV-related secondary infections. In recent years 8% of our infants weiP,hing <1.5 kg had documented sepsis, accounting for 14% of the deaths. These include fungal infections which have an insidious onset but dramatic sequelae. To facilitate earlier we report previously poorly recognized but dominant clinical features of fungal infection. In 1979-80, 10 infants with identifiable fungi (9 Candida, 1 Malassezia) representing 2.7% of LBW admissions, had a mean BW of 0.8 kg (0.6-1.1 kg), GA 28 wks and postnatal age of onset at 5 wks. Striking presenting clinical features included pulmonary infiltrates (pneumonia), radiographically indistinguishable from bronchopulmonary dysplasia and resulting in respiratory failure (8/10). Necrotizing enterocolitis was simulated in 7 with abdominal distention, guaiac positive stools, edema of the bowel wall, but ahsence of pneumatosis. Carbohydrate intolerance and glycosuria necessitating insulin therapy(?) and Candida endophthalmitis (4) were additional features. Predisposing factors included central arterial and venous lines, prolonged broad spectrum antibiotic usage(mean 23 days) for suspected (4) or confirmed bacterial infection(6}, and total parenteral nutrition(mean 37 days). Positive cultures for fungus were obtained from blood, ur5.ne, CSF and lung biopsy. In 6 infants cultures were intermittently positive. 4 had negative cultures despite microscopically visible fungus in urine and lung. 6 infants died, all responding with oliguria to amphotericin therapy. We conclude that in preterm infants fungal infections have protean manifestations necessitating a high index of suspicion. Nontypable Haemophilus influenzae are a frequent cause of otitis media in children and occasTOilally cause bacteremic illness in neonates and in older immunocompromised patients. The lack of specific strain markers has hampered studies on the relatedness and relative pathogenicity of different isolates. We applied the techniques of biotype detennination and SOS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of outer memhrane protein (OMP} preparations to 35 epidemiologically-unrelated pathogenic nontypable Haemophilus influenzae isolates. Three of five isolates obtained from the blood of unrelated newborns with sepsis had concordant major OMP profiles and were biotype IV. Two of five isolates obtained from the blood of unrelated older children or adults with bacteremia had concordant major OMP profiles, distinct from the corrmon profile of neonatal strains, and were biotype II. The OMP profiles of the remaining five isolates from blood, two isolates from CSF, and 23 isolates from middle ear aspirates of children with otitis media were unique, although each isolate had peptides with apparent molecular weights of 16,000 and 31,500. No nontypable isolate had an OMP profile identical with that of any of the 256 type b Haemophilus influenzae isolates we have examined. These results suggest that a subset of nontypable isolates associated with bacteremia have distinctive strain markers. Their pathogenicity may relate to a predilection for colonizing the female genital tract in the case of the corrmon neonatal strain, or an increased ability to evade host defenses. Diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT) vaccine has a very high level of reactions when administered according to current recommendations. Reduction of side effects while maintaining adequate protection would enhance acceptance of this product. In a prospective study, patients were randomized to receive standard (0.5 ml) or half (0.25 ml) doses of DPT vaccine for all 3 immunizations administered at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. Side effects and antibody responses were determined in 74 children who completed the entire primary series.",

Growth medium was also directly inoculated with dacron swabs at the bedside. Unexpectedly, one of the bedside-inoculated specimens did not yield B. pertussis. AD of GB\u00a3 to neonatal mucosal surfaces, a potentially important event in the pathogenesis of ms \"ilfection, has not been assessed. An AD assay employing H-labeled GBS and adult BEC in a ratio of\"-1000 bacteria/cell was developed. AD of several clinical and prototype Ia, II, and III GBS strains to BEC from healthy adults was defined. AD(# GBS/BEC) for the prototype strains was low (mean <l). In contrast, themean AD was 61 and 73, respectively, for Ia and II isolates from sick neonates. Each of 7 III-GBS isolates from sick neonates adhered poorly to adult BEC (mean 6). BEC from 10 i nfarts invasive GBS infection (5 early; 5 meningitis; 8 III-ffiS)were studied with the infecting GBS isolate, adult BEG-defined strains AD Ia-501 and non-AD III-732, and compared to age-matched controls. The mean AD of GBS infants' BEC (31) for their own isolates was significantly greater than that of control infants' BEC (9) (p <.03). 60% of GBS infants but no controls had high AD (>25), whereas 70% of controls' and only 30% of infected infants' BEC, respectively, adhered poorly (<lO)(p<.03). The AD of III strains to control infants' and adults' BEC was similar. Although Ia-501 also adhered better to BEC of infected infants vs. controls (mean 30 vs. 12), this difference was not significant. No AD of III-732 to either group's BECwas detecte:l. Age of onset or focus of infection did not significantly influence AD. These findings suggest that neonates at risk for invasive GBS infection may have increased BEC receptor sites for certain strains of GBS and/or that GBS may elaborate products which unmask these receptors. Live varicella vaccine was given to 21 susceptible children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and one child with non-Hodgkin' s lvmphoma. Ten patients were on chemotherapy and one or more years since remission or diagnosis. The remaining 12 had completed chemotherapy, Antibody was present in all the vaccinees at one month post-immunization and was still d.etectable in all 13 children tested at one year. Two vaccinees on chemotherapy who developed a biPhasic rash were the only who failed to develop a blastogenic response to VZ antigen. A third patient on chemotherapy developed an abortive rash following immunization. A sibling of one of the former patients seroconverted probably due to infection with vaccine virus spread from the vaccinee. Neither he or any other of the 18 susceptibls or 59 immune household contacts of vaccinees had clinical evidence of varicella. None of the other contacts had rises in VZ antibody following immunization. Four vaccinees had household exposures to chickenpox and one to zoster. This resulted in one mild case of chickenpox 2 years following vaccination. In addition, 2 vaccinees had multiple school exposures and 2 vaccinees other types of exposures with no illness resulting. None of the vaccinees have developed zoster thus far. The vaccine appears to be safe and effective, and routine administration should now be considered for children with leukemia one vear or more since diaRnosis or remission. Antibiotic therapy for children without foci of infection and at risk for bacteremia is controversial. We conducted a prospective randomized clinical trial using expectant antibiotic therapy in children at risk for bacteremia. Ninety-six children age 6-24 mo., with fever >40\u00b0c, no identifiable source of infection and leukocyte count >\"15,000 and/or sedimentation rate >30 were enrolled. All children had a blood culture, chest x-ray, urinalysis and urine culture. A lumbar puncture was performed if age <12 mos, Patients were randomized to receive either no antibiotic therapy or CR Bicillin 50,000 U/kg IM followed by Penicillin V 100 mg/kg/day for 3 days. Patients were examined at 24 and 72 hrs. Fifty patients were treated expectantly and 46 received no antibiotic therapy. Ten of the 96 patients were bacteremic (9 S. pneumoniae, 1 H. influenzae). Four of the 5 treated bacteremic cases were improved at the first follow up visit (afebrile and no obvious focus of infection We studied the ability of children immunized with DPT-polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP) to mount a serum opsonic response to HIB. Twenty-seven children were randomly assigned to receive PRP (GpA, N=l2) or DPT booster (GpB, N=l5). Sertm1 was obtained before and 1 month after vaccination. HIB opsonic activity was determined using 3H-thymidine-labeled HIB and normal human PMN. Five children in GpA, but only l in GpB had a significant rise in serum opsonic activity to HIB (p<0.05). Mean GpA postiamunization opsonic activity, expressed as % phagocytized bacteria, (xzSEM, 60.8%4.1) was significantly higher than that from GpB (47.5\u00b12.B)(p<0.05). Mean opsonic activity in the 5 responders was 64.8. Preimmunization serum from GpA and GpB had similar mean opsonic activity (GpA=52.7\u00b1. 2.8, GpB=46.fu, 2.9). Sera were also tested by radioimmunoassay for anti-PRP antibody. Ten children in GpA, including all 5 with an opsonic response, and none in GpB, had an increase in anti-PRP antibody. The presence of serum bactericidal and anticapsular antibody at the onset of HIB disease in some children suggests that other factors may be necessary for resistance to this organism. We have demonstrated an opsonic response to PRP vaccine which may contribute to host defense against HIB disease.",

In an attempt to explain this difference, we studied neutrophil(neut) production and marrow pool sizes in groups of 6-9 adult and neonatal rats inoculated with 3xl06 type II group B strep(GBS)/gm body wt. All infected adults survived, developing neutrophilia with a peak count of 340+18% of control(x+SEM, p<.001). In contrast, infected neonates-developed profound neutropenia of control, p<.001) and 88% died. In adults the neut storage pool (NSP=all PMN+bands+metamyelocytes within the marrow) diminished to 65+4% of control, but the neonates' NSP became almost completely depleted(9+2%, p<.001). Infected adults increased their granulocytic stem cells(CFUc) by 320:!:_20%(p<.001) and their CFUc proliferative rate (determined by tridiated thymidine suicide) by 95+4%(p<.001). In the face of neutropenia and NSP depletion, however, infected neonates had decreased CFUc(48+8%, p<.001) and CFUc proliferation did not increase. Thus, adult rats responded to GBS infection with neutrophilia, a modest temporary reduction in NSP, and an increase in stem cell number and proliferative rate. In contrast, infected neonates developed profound neutropenia, an exhausted NSP and did not increase stem cell number or proliferative rate. It appears that both exhaustion of the NSP and inability to accelerate neut production result in the neutropenia in neonatal GBS sepsis. The deficient neut supply which results may contribute to the high mortality in this condition. Sickle cell disease patients (SCD) produce antibodies after pneumococcal polysaccharide (PPS) immunization, but increased opsonic activity has not been demonstrated. We studied the correlation between a rise in s. pneumoniae type 7 PPS antibodies (aPPS-7), measured by RIA (Dr. G. Schiffman), and increased opsonization in vitro. We measured the uptake at 30 min by human neutrophils of radiolabelled type 7 bacteria opsonized with the test serum. A 2 fold increase (FI) was defined as a positive antibody response, and a 1.45 FI as a positive opsonic response (>2 x coefficient of variation). Sera from 18 SCD >2 yrs, 6 SCD <2 yrs, and 6 controls before and after PPS immunization were tested: --The majority of ampR Hi clinical isolates are free of physically demonstrable extrachromosomal DNA. Properties of these \"plasmid-free\" (pf) strains include stability of the 8-lactamase phenotype and conjugal transfer of amp resistance determinants to ampS recipients at low frequency. Moreover, ampR transconjugants obtained from such crosses uniformly contain plasmids. These observations suggest that plasmid DNA in pf strains may be physically integrated into the bacterial chromosome. To test this hypothesis, we utilized the transfer technique of Southern to visualize plasmid specific DNA sequences in the chromosome of pf ampR Hi. Total cellular DNA from pf ampR donor, amps recipient, and plasmid containing transconjugants was digested with Sac! restriction endonuclease. The resulting fragments were fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose where plasmid specific sequences were visualized by autoradiography after hybridization to 32p labeled plasmid DNA. These results demonstrate conclusively that maintenance of plasmid sequences in pf strains occurs via integration into the host genome. The clinical significance of the recognition of 2 modes of R factor carriage in Hi is derived from known evolutionary advantages enjoyed by bacterial strains with genetic elements of this versatility. Extrachromosomal R factors in Hi are easily Jost in the absence of antibiotic pressure but are readily transferred to other strains. Conversely, integration of R factors allows uniform stability of resistance determinants but inefficient dissemination in the species. SOM is a frequent residual of acute otitis media (AOM). This study was undertaken to determine the effect of oral antibiotics on the outcome of this residual SOM. The study was conducted in a private pediatric practice where pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry were perfonned on all patients 30 days followina the diaqnasis of AOM. Patients were eligible for enrollment in the study if they were found to have SOM at this followup visit. Following enrollment, subjects were randomly assigned to either treatment with a combination of sulfisoxazole (150 mg/kg/day) and erythromycin ethylsuccinate (50 mg/kg/day) for 10 days or no treatment. Repeat pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry was scheduled every 30 days for 4 months. Followup examiners were unaware of the initial. treatment regimen. Seventy subjects (50% treated) have been enrolled with a mean age of 3.5 years (range 0.8-11 years). At the first followup visit SOM was resolved in 31 subjects (58% treated) and persistent in 20 (55% treated). Nineteen patients returned with AOM prior to the first followup visit. Only 32% of these 19 patients were in the treatment group. Followup of the 20 patients with persistent SOM at 30 days post enrollment revealed 9 patients (44% treated) with persistent SOM at 60 days, 5 patients (60% treated) at 90 days and only 2 patients (50% treated) at 120 days. These data support the view that oral antibiotics will not hasten the resolution of SOM but may reduce the recurrence of AOM.

In contrast, 12 infants born to 34 seropositive women (mean follow-up 9.5 months, age 25 years, months breast feeding 3.2) acquired CMV between 1 and 6 months (p=0.01). None of the eleven infants who nursed less than I month became infected. Twelve of 23 infants who nursed long<r than I month did so (p=0.002), indicating that increased duration of breast feeding increasr:s the likelihood of infant acquisition. Eleven (31%) women shed CMV into their milk, 4 (11%) into their vaginal tract, 3 (9%) into their urine and 1 (3%) into saliva. Shedding at each maternal site (mean number of cultures per woman for milk 2.8, vagina 4.6, throat 4. 7, urine 4.4) was intermittent. Nine of II (82%) infants born to mothers who excreted CMV into breast milk became infected. Only 3 infants (13%) became infected who were born to the 23 mothers who excreted CMV from other sites or in whom CMV was not demonstrated. Clearly seropositive women who excrete CMV into their milk are more prone to infect their infants (p<0.001) and this appears to be the most common source of CMV for breast fed infants. Protracted pneumonitis of moderate severity associated with the onset of viruria in 2 infants co-infected with C. trachomatis has been the only adverse sequelae in the brief follow-up period. We have shown previously that OP activity of adult sera for fresh clinical Ia GBS isolates is mediated by the CPin a non-antibody dependent fashion. The present study was designed to determine the influence of opsoni ns other than type-specific anti body (TSA) which might be critical for efficient OP of Ia GBS by neonates. Sera colkted to preserve endogenous complement were obtained from 20 tenn neonates <72 hrs. old and their mothers. OP activity for a clinical IaGBS strain was determined in an assay requiring hllTian leukocytes, ser\\JTI and 3xl0 Ia GBS. Significant OP (bactericidal index [BI] was observed in 12 neonatal sera (mean 91%, range 75-98%), while 8 had deficient OP (mean 19%, range 0-37%). Chelation of high BI sera with MgEGTA inhibited CP-medi ated OP. OP was not influenced by TSA level (median 2. l \u00b5g/ml, both groups). However, the mean CH for high Bl sera (300 JU/ml} was significantly greater than that for5flow BI sera 6rean227 ,range 195,'Z72)(p<.OCI).

These results suggest that inadequate functional levels of one or more CP components could be a critical factor predisposing certain neonates to invasive type Ia GBS infection.

Severe gram-negative abscess disease in infants may be clinical evidence of phagocytic cell dysfunction. Since genitourinary CMV infection occurs despite the presence of specific antibody, a role for CMV-specific cellular immunity in control of infection has been postulated. We studied 92 healthy sexually active nonpregnant adolescent women with CMV cultures (cervix, urine, saliva, leukocytes), complement-fixing (CF) CMV antibodies, general measures of cellular immunity and CMV-speci fie lymphocyte blastogenesi!'-l. 20 wor.i.C'n were cult ;_ire-nnd seropositive (V+), 39 were culture negative but seropositive (S+) and 33 were culture-and seronegativc (S-). There were no significant differences among the 3 groups for E-rosettes or mitogen stimulation. There was no significant difference in frequency of CMV-specific lymphocyte reactivity (stimulation index >3.0 and net cpm >10,000) between V+ (12/20) and S+ (28/39) though both were significantly more often reactive than S-(3/33) (p<.001). Mean values for SI/net cpm were V+: 7.02\u00b10.76/16547\u00b12702; S+: 7. 79\u00b10. 72/16789\u20223387: S-: 3.20\u00b10.64/4854\u00b1948. There was no significant difference uetwcen V+ and S+ though both were significantly greater than S-(p<.001). Lack of viral contact with systemic immunocytes does not seem responsible for the lack or difference in systemic cellular immunity between V+ and S+ since the geometric mean CF titer of V+ {74.0\u00b116.9) was significantly greater {p<.02) than that of S+ (37.3:':6.4). We could not demonstrate that systemic CMV-specific cellular immunity is an important factor in genitourinary CMV infections. Most infants born to CMV-shedding women are not congenitally infected. It is unknown if such uninfected infants are exposed to CMV in utero. We studied infants of 59 adolescent women followed through pregnancy with CMV cultures (cervix, urine, saliva, leukocytes), complement-fixing (CF) CMV antibodies, CMV-specific lymphocyte blastogenesis and general measures of cellular immunity. 16 mothers shed virus while pregnant (V+), 29 were virus negative but seropositive (S+) and 14 were virus and seronegative (S-). Infants were studied with CMV cultures (cord blood, urine), cord CF-CMV antibodies, CMV-specific cord lymphocyte blastogenesis and general measures of cellular inununity. No significant differences were found among infants of the 3 groups for E-rosette number or mitogen stimulation. Geometric mean CF-CMV titer for infants of V+ (121.0\u00b134.5) was significantly greater (p<.001) than for infants of S+ (32.3\u00b16.0). The one congenitally infected infant (mother V+) had CMV-reactive lymphocytes (stimulation in-dex>3.0 and net cpm>l0,000). 7 of the 15 uninfected infants of V+ had CMV--;=;;ctive lymphocytes, as did 7 of 29 infants of S+ and 0 of 14 inf ants of S-. Since 5 of 14 mothers whose uninfected infants had CMV-reactive lymphocytes lacked reactive lymphocytes themselves at delivery, passive transfer of reactivity at delivery is unlikely. Some S+ mothers may have shed CMV at times not studied.

There were downward trends for mean net cpm through gestation for both V+ and S+ though they failed to reach significance. Mean SI and mean net cpm for V+ and S+ were greater than for S-throughout; this was significant at all times except for V+ net cpm at 20-30wks and postpartum. No significant differences were noted bet\u2022\u2022een V+ and S+. One mother (V+) had a congenitally infected newborn.

A prospective study of EBV infection in pregnant females was undertaken with 3 objectives: I) To define the current gy of EBV in this population and compare it with data collected previously 2) to test for serological evidence of reactivation of the latent, persistent carrier state and 3) to assess the effect of infection on the fetus. We measured antibodies from early and mid (20% of the women) pregnancy and cord sera to viral capsid antigen (VCA), early antigen (EA), and EB nuclear antigen (EBNA) using immunofluorescent assays. Thus far, 2000 women have been tested: 1386 in a clinic group (CG) and 614 in a private practice group (PG). Among the 1386 women in the CG, there were 8 (0.6%) seronegative [<20 yrs, 5/650 (0.8%); 21-30 yrs, 3/648 (0.5%); and )31 yrs, 0/88 (0%)]; 18 (2.9%) of the women in the PG were seronegative [<20, 2/42 (4.8%); 21-30 yrs, 12/388 (3.0%), and )31 yrs, 4/184 (2.J%)], By comparison, 17 (9%) of 185 pregnant women bled in 1959-1965 were seronegative (p(0.01). Titrations of 200 complete sets of sera have shown only occasional evidence of reactivation. Two infants born to women with asymptomatic primary seroconversions were normal and showed declining antibody titers in follow-up (Table) Further studies have been performed with live attenuated Towne strain CMV vaccine to determine: (!) the response to various dilutions (dil) and (2) the persistence of inununity beyond 1 yr and in vaccinees who become pregnant. (!) Volunteers (vol) who received 1:2, 1:5, and 1:10 dilutions of vaccine (10 3 \u00b7 5 pfu undiluted) were tested for complement fixing (CF) and anticomplement immunofluorescent (ACIF) anti bodies to CMV and for specific l1\u00b71\"phocyte proliferation (LP). Peak antibody responses ( Table) and the magnitude of the local reaction were compared with those seen in women previously receiving undiluted vaccine. All vaccinees developed an LP response which was of similar magnitude regardless of the vaccine dose. There was some diminution in the local reaction at dilution of !\u2022IO (2) (39) 10(97) LP response (mean 4117 cpm). 3 vol have become pregnant 6, 8, and 12 mos after vaccination and have maintained detectable responses by the CF, ACIF, and LP assays 4 to 8 mos into gestation. Dilutions (1:10, 1:5, 1:2) of CMV vaccine were irnmunogenic but had decreased potency for the development of humoral immunity. Following immunization with Towne strain vaccine, immunity appears to persist for more than 2 yrs and remains through gestation. CGD is a genetic disorder of bacterial killing by blood neutrophils (PMN). Patients usually present in the first 2 yrs of life with severe, chronic and recurrent bacterial infections. Approximately one third of reported patients die of infection before 7 yrs of age. Because of their susceptibility to infection we give all CGD patients TMP-SMX prophylaxis (2mg TMP/kgm/day) once daily. Our experience since 1972 includes 9 male patients given TMP-SMX for a mean of 5.6 yrs with a total patient experience of 51 patient yrs. Their mean age is 15 yrs (range [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . The diagnosis was established in each case by the failure of PMN to reduce nitroblue tetrazoliurn dye and to kill Staphylococcus normally in vitro. Five of 9 patients have been free of infection during--Y-5---yrs-of observation. Of the 4 remaining patients, there have been 6 infections over 35 yrs of observation. One patient, followed for 6 yrs, had a dental abscess. One patient, followed for 10 yrs, had a perianal abscess and has occasional skin pustules. One patient, followed for 10 yrs, had a perianal abscess and a liver abscess. The ninth patient, followed for 9 yrs, had one episode of a paronychia, a skin abscess and died following an 8-month illness characterized by fever, an elevated ESR and weight loss without demonstrating any focus of infection. We have not observed any side effects of TMP-SMX prophylaxis. Compared to published reports, our patients appear to have fewer infections while taking TMP-SMX and have a better prognosis. ",

Although primary acquisition of C1V infection during pregnancy has been accepted as the main contributor to congenital affliction, the role of reactivation of maternal CMV in congenital infection has not been completely elucidated. Health care workers, especially those caring for neonates, are thought to be at high risk for exposure to CMV. One hundred and fifty pregnant and nonpregnant women with direct patient contact (DPC) and without (NDPC) were matched for age, gravidity, parity, number of sexual partners, and age at initial sexual activity. These individuals were followed for up to 3 years and evaluated for CMV and HSV specific humoral and cell mediated immunity (CM!), cervical and urine viral excretion, and suppresion of CMI by serum and cellular factors. No significant differences were noted DPC and NDPC groups in terms of viral excretion, CMV or HSV seroconversion, or CMV or HSV geometric mean titers. Pregnant women demonstrated significant suppression of specific cell mediated immunity to CMV and HSV in all trimesters, particularly the third. This specific suppression is not related to serum factors but does seem to be related to a suppressor cell subpopulation. Natural varicella may be severe or fatal in children with leukemia. We therefore immunized 63 children with leukemia in remission with 1000 pfu of live attenuated varicella (Oka) vaccine, to induce primary immunity to varicel la-zoster (VZ) virus. Twenty-seven of children had received no chemotherapy for 1-12 months (mean 6) prior to vaccination. Maintenance chemotherapy was suspended for 2 weeks in 36 vaccinees. All tested seroconverted and developed cellular immunity (CMI) to VZ virus in 3-8 weeks.",

Rats, intranasally colonized at age 10 days with 2-5 x 106 cfu Hib, were challenged at age 112 to 120 days with 6-26 x 106 cfu Hib intraperitoneally (ip). Among 31 rats who became bacteremic during np colonization (C-B), 1(3.2%) was bacteremic upon ip challenge. Among 14 colonized but nonbacteremic (C-NB) rats, 12 (85.7%) were bacteremic after challenge. Of 14 noncolonized and nonbacteremic (NC-NB) control rats, 10 (71.4%) were bacteremic after challenge. There was no difference in duration of bacteremia nor in peak bacteremic levels post-challenge between C-NB and NC-NB rats (p ) 0.05, rank sum test). Among C-NB rats, rates of bacteremia after ip challenge were identical (85.7%) in both heavily and lightly colonized animals. Likewise, in C-NB rats there was no correlation between either duration (r = -0.224) or degree (r = -0.41) of bacteremia after challenge, and duration of earlier np carriage (range = 2 to 28 days) of Hib.",

To determine the duration of i11111unity to RSV and factors associated with reinfection, 15 young healthy adults with natural RSV infection were subsequently followed for over 2 years and challenged with RSV (NIH safety-tested pool) at increasing intervals (;2,4,8,14,20,26 months from time of natural infection). Thirteen (87%) became reinfected within 20 months, 12 (80%) within 8 months. Two (13%) remained immune. Of 13 reinfected, 7 (54%) acquired a third infect ion after mean i nterva 1 of 18 months ( nnge 12-24 months). Initial natural infections tended to be MOre severe than challenge reinfection, with third infections mildest. Asymptomatic infections occurred in 0/15 initial, 3/13 second, and 4/7 third infections. The titer and duration of RSV shedding diminished from second to third infections. The level of nasal or serum antibody did not correlate with the risk of infection. Serum antibody rose 4-fold (by ELISA, Neut or CF) in 55% of infections. Mean nasal antibody titer tended to increase with infection or sometimes with inoculation without other evidence of infection. These findings suggest that i11111unity to RSV after natural infection is often of short duration, or that important antigenic differences exist among RSV strains. But after > two infections, inmunity lengthens and infections become less symptomatic, along with diminished viral shedding. Successful i11111unization may thus require 2 or more inoculations and may provide protection only for a limited time, hopefully of sufficient duration to provide ilTITiunity for the period of greatest risk for an infant. , 1979) .

Because of evidence indicating that the epidemiology of parainfluenza virus type 3 (para 3) may be influenced by Persistent infection (PI) of individuals, we have developed an in vitro model of nara 3 PI in Vero cells. Previous work that the mechanism of initiation of PI in this system involved the production of a soluole virus gene product that prevented the development of viral cytopathic effects. This product could not be implicated, hovever, in the maintenance of PI since it was undetectable after a few passages. We therefore sought to determine vhether the mechanism of maintenance involved the selection of temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants, a factor implicated in several other systems of PI. Clones were isolated from the virus population that initiated the PI and from the virus population being shed into the supernatant fluid after 6 months of FI. The former population contained no ts mutant clones whereas 25 of 26 clones isolated from the latter showed a ratio 39oc/35\u00b0c of lo-1 or less. The mutants tended to l:e unstable with 12 clones reverting to a ts ::ihenotype and 2 more showing a significant increase in 39\u00b0c/35\u00b0c yield ratios after 2 passages at 35\u00b0c. Comolementation studies on the stable clones indicated that thy\" all shared a common lesion.

Thus: 1) Initiating DTP immunization at nursery discharge does not produce evidence of immunologic tolerance, and 2) produces higher mean titers of IgM antibody which may reflect greater protection to pertussis. Thirty-five children 15-18 months were randomly assigned to receive a DPT-polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP) (Gp. A) or DPT booster (18) (Gp. B). Febrile, local and systemic reactions were monitored. Pre and 1 month post immunization throat and rectal swabs were tested for presence of HIB or cross-reacting bacteria. Sera obtained at the same times were tested by radioimmunoassay for anti-PRP antibody (J. Immunol. Methods 1981:43:33-47 ). An antibody concentration of 0/15 \u00b5g/ml is considered protective. Fever to 1030F (R) occurred in 4 of each group at 6 and 24 hours in different subjects. Local reactions occurred in 1/3 and systemic reactions in half of each group. None was severe. One child in each group had HIB in the pre-immunization throat swab: both had initial antibody titers > 0/15 \u00b5g/ml. Twelve of Gp. A and 10 of Gp. B had initial antibody levels of < 0/15 \u00b5g/ml. Nine of Gp. A reached the protective level post immunization, and 12/17 had either a twofold increase in anti-PRP or the final con\u00b7 centration of 0/15 \u00b5g/ml. Geometric mean titer increased from 0/10 to 0/89. No change occurred in anti-PRP titers in Gp. B. The addition of PRP to DPT results in no significant increase in reactions compared with DPT alone and a protective level of antibody to PRP was achieved in 70% with a single dose. Infants with lower respiratory infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis have elevated serum IgM and IgG, but not IgE levels. Cellular concomitants of the hyperglobulinemia were studied by enumerating B cell and T cell numbers in peripheral blood monor.uclear cells (PBMC) from infected babies. Seven infants, 3-10 weeks old, with chlamydial pneumonia contained 34.3 + 9.7% surface IgM bearing B cells in their PBMC fraction compared to 8.7 + 3.3% of normal adult PBMC and 14.0 + 6.6% of PBMC from infants (< 6 months) with various other infections. Numbers of cells with surface IgD and IgG were also increased. Plasma cells with cytoplasmic IgM, IgG and IgA constituted more than 8% of PBMC compared to < 0.8% in control infants and adults. Except for a modest decrease in total T cell proportions, no gross abnormalities of T cells were revealed by enumerating cells stained with the monoclonal anti T cell antibodies OKT3, OKT4 and OKT8. When cultured in vitro without added mitogen, PBMC from 3 infants with chlamydial pneumonia secreted as much immunoglobulin as adult cells treated with pokeweed or mitogens and more than 20-fold greater than control infant PBMC either stimulated or unstimulated. These results suggest that B lymphocytes are polyclonally expanded and activated during We have been able to produce congenital infection and disease in fetal rhesus macaques after intrauterine inoculation of rhesus cytomegalovirus ( Rh-CMV) in seropositive mothers. At 80 days gestation, II rhesus macaque fetuses were inoculated intracerebrally by laparotomy of the mother and trans uterine injection into the fetus with 0.20 ml of Rh-CMV inoculum ( 104.25), At birth five animals showed hydrocephalus.

The Rh-CMV was isolated from various fetal tissues, as well as placenta and amniotic fluid. Placentas from virus-inoculated animals showed placentitis, with intranuclear inclusion bodies consistent with CMV. Eight controls did not develop congenital disease nor did CMV antibody titers rise in the mothers. These studies demonstrate rhesus macaque fetal susceptibility to CMV infection and the induction of congenital disease. 3800 infants received in a double blind fashion 14valent pneumococcal vaccine or saline placebo at the age of 6 (15%), 7 (60%), 8 (20%) or 9 (5%) months. The vaccinations were performed at the local health centers as part of the routine vaccination program. A booster dose was given appr. 5 months later. The serum antibody response was monitored in a cohort of 100 infants by radio-and enzyme-immunoassay. The families were informed of symptoms and signs suggestive of acute otitis media (AOM) and told to bring the infant to the project clinic when suspecting AOM. After clinical examination, middle ear exudate was obtained for culture and typing of pneumococci. The patient was treated with antimicrobials, and followed until the exudate had cleared. The data from a period of 12 to 23 months after vaccination show that prevention of AOM was spec if ic for the pneumococcal types evoking a serum antibody response. However, the response to most of the polysaccharides was poor at this early age. Infant survivors of RDS are believed to develop residua which predispose them to increased respiratory illness (RI) morbidity.

In previous studies which demonstrated an absence of detectable type-specific antibody in cord or acute illness sera of 30 infants with type III GBS sepsis, we observed that total serum IgG levels in the septic infants were distinctly less than those in the cord sera of healthy newborns. We therefore compared serum IgG levels (using radial immunodiffusion) in 14 infants < 7 days old with GBS sepsis and 14 well infants matched for birthweight (within 100 gm), gestational age (within 1 wk), and postnatal age (within 1 d). IgG levels were significantly less (p < .02) in the septic infants compared to the controls (901\u00b1473 mg/lOOml vs. 1305\u00b1268 mg/lOOml). Total protein in the two groups was not significantly different (5.3\u00b1.9 gm/lOOml vs. 5.7\u00b1.7 gm/lOOml), indicating that the difference was not due to a generalized increase in protein catabolism in sepsis. r!aternal sera, available for 8 of the septic newborns, did not have a corresponding decrease in IgG (1082\u00b1 260 mg/lOOml vs. 716\u00b1296 mg/lOOml in their infants). The IgG levels of three septic infants > 30 days old were not significantly different from of matched controls (457\u00b155 mg/lOOml vs 580\u00b1101 mg/lOOml). These findings suggest that serum lgG is depleted in the course of neonatal GBS sepsis. Whether this occurs in other bacterial infections or in older infants is unknown. This suggests a rationale for the use of fresh frozen plasma or immune globulin in the treatment of newborn sepsis.

The use of prophylactic antibiotics in cystic fibrosis is controversial. The effect of prophylactic inhaled cephaloridine on bacterial colonization of the respiratory tract and on the general progression of the disease was studied in a 2 year prospective study. 47 patients (24 males and 23 females; mean age 13 years} with mild to moderate pulmonary disease participated. Balanced groups were formed after stratification by age, sex, and pulmonary function. One group received inhaled cephaloridine and the other received no inhaled antibiotic. Both groups received oral cloxacillin. No significant differences between outcome variables of the 2 groups were observed. Quantitative sputwn cultures showed that 90% of patients carried Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 36% carried P. cepacia, 20% carried Staphylococcus aureus. No hospital admission was associated with S. aureus infection. There were no differences between the annual incidence of respiratory tract infections (4.3 vs 5.7) or hospital admissions (0.4 vs 0.7). Girls had higher rates than boys for both these variables. Schwachrnan scores, Xray scores and pulmonary function showed no differences between the groups in the expected deterioration over time.

After intravaginal inoculation with 10 pfu of HSV (MS strain), over 95% of animals developed primary genital infection with peak lesion severity and lesion virus titers on days 5-8 and healing by days 12-15. Mortality due to the primary disease was low (0-20%). Recurrent lesions (1-2 mm vesicles with erythematous bases) appeared spontaneously on the external genital skin in 80-100% of animals. Lesions seldom persisted more than 24 hrs. Mean time the first recurrence was day 26 (range 22 to 41 days). Recurrences were frequent with a mean of 3.5 per animal (range 2-9) through day 50. Recurrent lesions continued to appear after day 50, but less frequently. HSV (confirmed by neutralization) was recovered from approximately 10% of recurrent lesions sampled (swab and biopsy). Eight {47%) of 17 animals with recurrent lesions had latent HSV recovered from sacral ganglia.

The prevalence of diarrhea within the preceding month in children who excreted C and/or T was greater (60%) than in non excretors (40%) (p<.0.05).

Levels of IgG antibody to tetanus toxoid were measured in paired maternal and full-term cord blood samples, as well as in premature peripheral blood using an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) and a latex agglutination technique. Both methods were found to be sensitive in detecting antibody levels well below the 0.01 I.U./ml considered to be the minimum protective level. Based on a standard of 280 I.U./ml (Connaught Laboratories, Toronto), the mean antibody level in 20 maternal samples was 0.53 (range: 0.037-2.29). In the 20 paired cord blood samples, the mean level was 0.60 I.U./ml (range: 0.050-2.50). In 55% of cases, the cord blood levels were higher than the maternal levels (0.75 \u00b1o.87 vs. 0.56\u00b10.68). In 13 prematures weighing <2000g the mean antibody level was 0.44 I.U./ml (range 0.053-2.45) which was significantly lower than the level in full-term infants (p<0.001). These results provide further evidence for an active transport of antibodies across the placenta during pregnancy and indicate that, since prematures have signficantly lower levels of tetanus antibody than full-term infants, those whose mothers have borderline low protective levels (e.g. 0.03 I.U./ml) may not be passively protected against tetanus in the neonatal period. The production of 2'-5'A synthetase is stimulated by interferon (IFN) and may play a role in its antiviral, antiproliferative and immunomodulating functions. 2'-5'A synthetase is detectable in the lymphocytes of healthy adult controls at a level of 60\u00b140 pmoles/hr/A 260 . Of 17 patients with proven bacterial meningitis and/or sepsis, only 2 patients had levels which were greater than 2 S.D. above the mean control level.

Whether this reflects the absence of an IFN-reactive lymphocyte subpopulation or the lack of IFN receptors is under investigation. (1) is transferred from mother to infant by breast and probably by placenta and (2) Electrophoresis (EP) of rotaviral (RV) genomes was employed to identify RV strains found in nosocomial outbreaks in a tertiary care nursery, in which 22 of 102 infants had RV infection. Enough nucleic acid (RljA) for EP was recovered from viruses in the stools of 17/22 (77%). The time sequence and proximity of RV infected infants in the nursery rooms had suggested two distinct outbreaks with baby-to-baby spread of a single RV strain. However, when RV RNA patterns were analyzed, five distinct patterns were found among viruses from different patients. There were four different RNA electropherotypes identified during each outbreak period. We had evidence of baby-to-baby spread of two distinct RNA electropherotypes in each outbreak period. RNA patterns of these nursery RV strains were similar (\"long\" gel pattern) to those previously seen in patients from the coillllunity. In brief: a) infants hospitalized in a tertiary care nursery can become infected with different RV strains, some similar to those prevalent in the coillllunity; and b) secondary spread of individual strains can be traced with considerable accuracy by RNA EP. Although type-specific carbohydrate antigens induce protective immunoloqic responses against group B streptococcal infection ,other factors also contribute to the virulence of these organisms. We and others have previously reported strain differences within the same serotype in opsonic requirements and virulence. Some strains (R) are relatively resistant to opsonization by antibody and express increased virulence, while other strains (S) are sensitive to oosonization and are less virulent. Neuraminidase decreases the virulence of both type Ills and lllR strains while not affecting 11 5 or llR. strains. Loss of virulence is associated with the removal of 7cn of cellular sialic acid. We examined II , llR' Ills and lllR strains (N=12) by electron microscopy to deti?rmine if S and R strains could be differentiated morphologically and if neuraminidase altered the surface topoqraohy of these organisms. In 9 of 12 strains hair-like fimbriae were observed extending from the surface. The presence of fimbriae was indeoendent of serotype or S /R type. When fimbriae were present changes in virulence were associated with the complete loss of these structures. Thus, 1)this is the first indication that some strains of serotype 11 and 111 group B streptococci express fimbriae on their cell surface, 2)the fimbriae may (type Ill) or may not (type Ill be removed by neuraminidase, and 3)when fimbriae are expressed, their removal is associated with neuraminidase-induced decrease in virulence. These structures may have a critical role in the group B streptococci/host defense interaction. intrapartum AMT is of concern to pediatricians as it may mask bacterial infection, inhibit growth in cultures, or lead to empirical AMT in neonates. At Parkland Hospital \"-90% of women undergoing Cesarean delivery at term for cephalopelvic disproportion after >6h rupture of membranes develop serious uterine infection unless given perioperative antibiotics. We have analyzed pregnancy outcome in 2 groups of such women given AMT before (n= 421) or after (n=l52) cord occlusion, to determine risk in the neonate for sepsis or empirical AMT, and maternal outcome. Physician concern for neonatal infection, reflected by blood cultures and/or differential cell count, was evident in 23/152 (15%) infants not exposed to AMT in utero compared to 115/412 (2B%) infants exposed in utero, p=.01; there was no difference in the incidence of jaundice, or AMT. Upon evaluation of these 138 infants there was no difference in the incidence of risk factors in the AMT exposed and unexposed infants, and no pas i tive cu 1tures. The economic impact was significant with excess hospital costs in exposed, $248\u00b1237 (X\u00b1SD, n=ll), and unexposed, but evaluated infants, $1561102 (n=l8), significantly greater than infants unexposed and not evaluated, $64\u00b187 (n=30), p<.025.

HIG may be useful in the prophylaxis of Hib disease in high-risk children. Antibodies (Ab) to capsular and noncapsular antigens of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) confer protection against experimental H1b disase. However, the antiqenic specificities of protective noncapsular Ab have not been defined. Hib rabbit antisera were sequentially absorbed with type b capsule (PRP) and Hib lipopolysaccharide (LPS), both coupled to sepharose 4B. Affinity purified Ab were eluted from the solid phase. Adequacy of serum absorption and titers of affinity purified Ab were monitored by RIA or ELISA. Affinity purified anticapsular Ab, anti-LPS Ab, and immune serum absorbed to remove LPS and PRP Ab but containing high titers of Ab to outer membrane proteins, were all bactericidal in vitro. Infant rats were passively protected (absence of bacteremia in 30% of animals following IP challenge) by as little as 90-250 ng of PRP Ab per rat. In contrast, 1000 fold more affinity purified anti-LPS Ab (or anti-LPS Ab in hyperimmune serum prepared against boiled bacterial cells) failed to prevent bacteremia (103-10 5 tfu/ml blood). But immune serum absorbed with PRP and LPS and containing Ab to outer membrane proteins was hiqhly protective. Protection by the latter could be removed by absorption with Hib outer membrane. In conclusion, Ab against PRP and outer membrane proteins are bactericidal and protective. However, onti-LPS Ab, although bactericidal, is not protective. These results support the inclusion of outer membrane proteins in experimental vaccines for prevention of Hib disease in children. Despite refinements in the counting technique of urine for bacteria and white cells, there are many difficulties in obtaining voided specimens which are uncontaminated, particularly with infants. These can lead to major problems in interpretation. Percutaneous suprapubic aspiration of the urinary bladder has proved to be easy, safe and a useful method of obtaining urine for accurate diagnosis of urinary tract infection. It has been our impression that the failure rate was quite high among junior house staff. An in-house survey of 25 pediatric residents (1st year to 3rd year) revealed a surprisingly high failure rate ranging from 100% to at least 20%. The general consensus among the house staff was that the major cause of failure was tapping an empty bladder. Since a bedside real time ultrasonography machine (ATL Mark I I I) became available a year ago, we have routinely scanned the urinary bladder just above the symphysis pubis area the procedure. Suprapubic tap was performed only after the bladder was identified and full. After more than a dozen procedures, the failure rate was zero. The technique is easy and simple. A full bladder is clearly defined on the screen and the needle is visible when it is being introduced. The obvious danger is perforation of viscera near the bladder. This risk is best avoided by ensuring that the bladder is full by ultrasonography. Unnecessary time, effort, trauma, and pain can be saved by performing bedside urinary bladder ultrasound scanning prior to suprapubic bladder aspiration. In a preliminary study (ICAAC), type b (PRP) Ab responses to PRP-pertussis vaccine (Lederle) were found to be impaired in siblings (S) of patients with Hib meningitis. In the present study, the sample size has been increased and we present data on total Ab to PRP (by RIA), IgG and IgM Ab to PRP (by SPRIA), and the IgG responses to pertussis (by SPRIA). 21 sibs, ages 9-23 mos, were immunized (2 injections separated by 1 mo). The Ab responses of the S were compared to the responses of 21 immunized controls (C) matched for age and race but without a family history of Hib disease. S were divided into 2 groups, those who were born after the case and who were not exposed to Hib disease (Sl, N=13), and those who were alive at the time of the case (S2, N=8).",

Restriction endonuclease digestion analyses (REDA) of the human CMV genome have demonstrated marked heterogeneity among epidemiologically unrelated CMV isolates. REDA of longitudinal CMV cervical isolates suggest that women can have cervical infections with multiple strains of CMV. It is unknown if individuals may have a systemic infection with more than one CMV strain. To help answer this question, premature identical twins who acquired CMV infections while hospitalized during their first 2 months of life were studied. REDA of their original CMV isolates indicated that the infants were infected with different strains of CMV. Following discharge home of the babies at 3 months of age, they slept in the same crib, shared the same toys and were in frequent close contact with each other. Longitudinal assessment of the infants indicated that they continued to excrete CMV in their urine for at least 2 yrs following their initial infection. REDA of the twins' viral isolates at 2 yrs indicated that they maintained their initial CMV strains and that there was no evidence of viral transmission between the children. Follow-up of the twins' mother, however, indicated that 3 months following the infants discharge home that she developed a primary CMV infection. REDA of her viral isolate indicated that she was infected with the identical strain as one of her twins. These findings suggest that normal individuals do not develop concomitant systemic infections with multiple strains of CMV, and that it should be possible to develop an effective CMV vaccine. Twenty-five patients with steroid responsive idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) were vaccinated with a polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine. Serum was obtained pre-vaccination, 1,6 and 12 months after vaccination and during disease relapse. Total typespecific pneumococcal antibody concentration (ABY), measured by radioimmunoassay, was expressed as ng of anticapsular antibody nitrogen (nqN)/ml. . Patients were divided into three groups(gr): gr I-no relapse (n.11), gr II-relapse during the study period but serum not obtained within three weeks of relapse(n:lO), gr III-serum obtained at the time of relapse (n=7). Linear regression lines were determined for each anticapsular-type antibody for each patient. An average slope was calculated for each anticapsular type within a patient group. No differences were found between gr I and II with regard to rate of antibody decline, but at one year gr II patients had mean ABY <200 ngN/ml against types 4,7,8,14 and 19. Gr.

Stress may be an additional factor which can further compromise immune function. The purpose of this study was 1) to compare neutrophil (PMN) killing in newborn infants and adults; 2) to determine the effect of stress on the bactericidal capacity of neonatal PMNs. PMNs were obtained from 3 groups: 26 adults, 13 healthy neonates (B.W. 3239.2 .! 208.9 g (m .! SD), GA 38.8 .! 1.3 wk.), and 29 \"stressed\" neonates (B. W I 935.8 .! 891. l g, GA 32. 9 .! 4.3 wk.). The \"stressed\" population included infants with RDS (n=24), aspiration syndromes (n=3), and sepsis (n=2). 28 of 29 required mechanical ventilation. PMN monolayers on coverslips were incubated with type le group B streptococcus (GBS) in 10% adult serum. Coverslips were stained with acridine orange, and bacterial killing was assessed using a fluorochrome microassay. Killing was expressed as number of dead organisms/total number phagocytosed X JOO.

Our ongoing prospective study of EBV-induced infectious mane nucleosis in children has revealed that this disease is not uncommon in infants and preschoolers. This paper will focus on the frequency, clinical manifestations, heterophile antibody responses, EBV-specific antibody responses, and EBV excretion observed in these very young patients. Sixty of 139 children diagnosed to have EBV-induced infectious mononucleosis over a 5-year period were less than 6 years old; 8 other young patients had a similar clinical illness unassociated with an EBV infection. In addition to the usual typical cases, syndromes with prominent manifestations in other organ systems, histiocytosis-like skin eruption, or failure to thr;ve pictures were occasionally documented. Heterophile antibody responses increased stepwise from 0% in infants less than 1 year old to adult-type rates of 80% by 4 year olds. The young patients had more transient laM antibody responses to EBV-capsid antigen, a low but still higher rate of antibodies directed to restricted component of EBV-early antige and an earlier onset of antibodies to EBV-nuclear antigen than older children and adults. EBV was present in oropharyngeal secretions in 44 (73%) young children sampled during the acute phase, a rate similar to that in adult patients. It appears that EclV-induced infectious mononucleosis is not a rare entity in the very young. Since heterophile antibody frequently may not be detected in these age groups, EBV-specific antibody responses may be necessary for making the diagnosis. Fifty-six children 3-21 years of age with culture proven group A Streptococcus pharyngotonsillitis were treated with cephalexin bid vs. qid in a double-blind fashion. Patients were seen at the beginning of treatment, 10 and 24 days later. Initial throat cultures were processed for group A Streptococcus, virus, chlamydia, mycoplasma and B-lactamase producing bacteria; throat cultures for strep and blood for ASO, anti-DNase and streptozyme were obtained on each visit. Compliance was evaluated by counting residual medicine and by M. lutea bioinhibition of urine.",

Antibiotic treatment was initiated within 72 hours after onset of symptoms at 96 hours or later in 16/38. There were no significant differences in the geometric means of the anti-DNase Btiters between early and late treatment groups at the onset of and.on evaluation. Significant increases (a rise of 2 dilution increments or > 0.2 log) in anti-DNase B occurred in 13% of the patients with early therapy and 58% with treatment (p = 0.05). Compliance was good in of patients and poor in 8%. Bacteriologic failure occurred in only I of 56 patients. (Fikrig et al., J. Inft>ct. Dis. 137:818, 1978) . Of the 10 VdCCinated children, 2 have died, and one has moveu away. Sera from the remaining 16 patients were examined by to determine the antibody response to 11 of the types contained in the polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine. The lowest protective level of geometric mean titre> (Gtff) of antibody in our laboratory (G. Schiffman) is 300 ng/ml. Fifty-six ' .I, (9/16) tients showed adequate GMT 5 years post vaccination. P.11 9 patients had minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS). Forty-four % (7/16) children had a GMT less than 300 ng/ml. Three of these patients had focal sclerosis, 3 had membrano proliferative 910merulo nephritis (MPGN) and 1 patient had lgM nephropathy. Of these 7 patients one with the lowest GMT (23 n9/ml) developed pneumococcal peritonitis. During this same period, in 20 other unvaccinated nephrotic patients followed continuously from 76-81, 7 cases of peritonitis occurred (p c.05). Additionally, 1 unvaccinated child died of pneumococcal sepsis. We conclude that pneumococcal vaccination provides long lasting immunity in MCNS patients and that vaccinated nephrotic patients with diseases othPr than MCNS sh0uld be evaluated annually for presence of adequate antibody. At least 50% of mothers of infants with acquired HSV infections deny symptoms of recurrent genital HSV in the past. It has been inferred that asymptomatic (Sx-) shedding at the time of birth is the usual source of infection in these infants. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of Sx-shedding in pregnant women who had had HSV isolated (HSV +) from genital lesions during pregnancy and to make an immunological and clinical assessment of the time of onset of HSV infection in mothers of infected infants. Of 58 pregnant women with HSV + perineal lesions who had a cervical culture performed on the same day, 2 (3.4%) shed HSV from the cervix. Of 326 cultures taken to detect Sx-shedding from 139 pregnant women who were previously HSV +, 2 (0.6%) were positive; therefore, 1 .4% of these women had Sx-shedding. None of 27 delivery cultures were HSV +. Of 21 mothers of infected infants, 5 had a history of recurrent genital HSV and 16 did not. Of the latter, 7 mothers had clinical findings compatible with a primary infection. All of these mothers and their had neutralization titers of< 1:10 to HSV 1 and 2. Of the infants of the other 9 mothers who denied a history of HSV, 7 had neutralization titers of< 1:10. Only 2% of 41 normal infants of mothers with recurrent HSV-infections during pregnancy had titers at this level. The rate of Sx-shedding in women with recurrent HSV is similar to that of normal women. Primary maternal infections at term are an important source of neonatal HSV infection.

Sch. of Med., Dept. of Peds., New Haven, CT We have reported that glucose oxidation to C02 is decreased in suckling rat lung compared to adult rates. We have now determined the rate of s hydroxybutyrate oxidation to C02 in developing rat lung and determined the effect of s hydroxybutyrate on glucose oxidation in lung. Maximal rate of s hydroxybutyrate oxidation by developing rat lung slices decreases from 0.60 + 0.05 (S.E.) n moles/mg wet wt/hr at 6 days of age to 0.42 + 0.02 by 16 days of age. (p<0.005). Adult rates are also 0.42.-Glucose oxidation to C02 in developing rat lung increased from a suckling rate of 0.20 n moles/mg wet wt/hr to an adult rate of 0.44. In the presence of s hydroxybutyrate glucose oxidation in lung decreased by 25% in suckling and adult animals. Though the maximal rate of s hydroxybutyrate oxidation in rat lung only decreased 33% from 6 days of age to adult, the concentration of s hydroxybutyrate available during the suckling period is 6 fold greater than in the adult. This data suggest that ketones are a significant oxidative substrate in lung during a period when glucose is suppressed. NADPH is required for the reductive biosynthesis of numerous substances. In many species, the principal source of NADPH is the pentose phosph<lte pctthway, for which glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is the initial and rate-limiting step. Earlier reports from this laboratory indicated that G6PD of normal and G6PD-deficient red cells is inhibited 5-fold to 200-fold by an unknown macro-molecular substance. The combination of this factor and G6PD deficiency, not G6PD deficiency alone, accounts for the clinical problems in many of the 100 million people with defects of G6PD. The factor has now been identified as a protein+ which regulates G6PD by holding most of the red cell NADP (NADP and NADPll) in a bound form. The protein appears to be distinct from both Fx protein and the Eggleston-Krebs factor.",

The use of intravenous calcium (Ca) in sick infants has been reconmended to maintain Ca homeostasis. We compared bolus and continuous infusions to determine which method better maintained levels of ionized Ca (iCa). The new Radiometer I CALl Ionized Calcium Analyzer was used for simultaneous determinations of iCa in mmol/L & pH. The instrument also corrects for iCa at pH 7.4 (ciCa). By random selection, 10 pts were treated by continuous (group A) and 8 pts by intermittent bolus (group B) infusions. 250 mg/kg of Ca gluconate was given over 24 hours to group A and in 4 divided doses at 6 hr intervals to group B. iCa determinations were carried out at hours 0-3, 4-6, 8-12, 18-24 . Changes in iCa (A iCa) compared with pre-infusion iCa levels were measured. Although unpredictable variations in'1iCa andAciCa were observed, iCa consistently increased in both groups A & B. Seventy-eight youths with insulin dependent diabetes (!DD) were followed for 4 or more yrs. with annual fluorescein angiography (FA). FA was graded: 0-10 microaneurysms=no significant abnormalities (NSA), 10 or more microaneurysms plus fluorescein leakage= significant abnormalities (SA), neovascularization=proliferative retinopathy (PR). Glycemic control was evaluated with HbAlc. The IDD were grouped as (1) .025 .01 NS NS HLA typing performed on 30 of the IDD's showed an increase in 88 in both groups when compared to 100 non-diabetic controls (ND) p <.01. Similarly DR3 and DR4 were each significantly increased in IDD when compared to 495 ND.

Chronic hyperinsulinism attenuates fetal hepatic glucose and ketone production, accou11ting in part for l1ypoglycemia in the IDM; and it augments lipid synthesis. The latter may contribute to the corpulence of these infants. West The purpose of this study was to examine the roles of gluconeogenic substrate (GS) availability and fatty acid oxidation in glucose homeostasis of newborn SGA infants. At 4 hrs of age, as their first caloric intake, 5 hypoglycemic (HG) ( < 30 mg/di) and 5 normoglycemic (NG) SGA infants were given injections-of L-alanine, 150 mg/kg, and I hr later Intralipid 0.5 g fat/kg. Plasma concentrations (cone.) of glucose, alanine, pyruvate, lactate, triglycerides, free fatty acids (FFA), glycerol, B-OH-butyrate (BOHB) and acetoacetate were followed for 5 hrs. After alanine injection glucose cone. did not change in the HG but decreased in the NG (p < 0.05). The fl, alanine at 60 min. was greater in the HG than in the NG (p < 0.05). The sum of alanine, lactate and pyruvate remained high in the HG but decreased rapidly in the NG (p < 0.005). FFA and BOHB decreased in all 10 infants.

Although intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is thought to be a manifestation of alteration in blood flow to the germinal matrix, the metabolic consequences of this lesion are unknown, and neonates with IVH often have long lasting hypoglycorrhachia, which may imply profound alterations in cerebral metabolism. We have used the 14C 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) method to study local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) in the beagle pup model of IVH. 12 pups (12-48 hrs, 300-425 g wt) were anesthetized, tracheotomized, paralyzed, and ventilated. Arterial blood gases and blood pressure were obtained through a femoral artery cannula. IVH was induced in 6 by removal of 20-25% of their total blood volume via a femoral venous catheter followed by rapid venous reinfusion 5minutes later. 6 additional pups served as controls. In the hemorrhage pups, MABP was 80 mm Hg prior to the withdrawal of the blood, 65 mm Hg during the hypotensive phase and 93 mm Hg following reperfusion. Control pups had MABP 82 ITITl Hg throughout. 50 minutes following the induction of IVH, LCGU was measured. 14C 2DG concentrations were 24, 16, 22 and 18 \u00b5Ci for the cortex, white matter, caudate nucleus and germinal matrix respectively of the controls. For the experimental group 2DG concentrations included cortex 22, white matter 21, caudate nucleus 22 and germinal matrix 21 \u00b5Ci. Although cerebral blood flow changes are known to occur in specific brain regions in this model of IVH, there may be uncoupling of blood flow and metabolism throughout the brain. Pritzker Sch.

Case Western Reserve Univ.,Dept.Peds., Cleveland, OH Neonatal glucose(GLU) homeostasis is imprecisely controlled as evident by fasting hypoglycemia and alimented hyperglycemia. Galactose(GAL) alimeotation has recently been suggested to help regulate carbohydrate assimilation. To better define the mechanism of GAL enhanced GLU homeostasis, 5 day old newborn rats were fasted overnight and fed 0.6g/kg of GLU or GAL by oro-gastric tube. Blood GLU and GAL and hepatic glycogen(GLYC) content were determined at 0 and 15 and then at 30 min intervals.

Tissue carnitine levels and renal loss of carnitine were studied in a 5 3/12 year old child with muscle weakness, mental retardation, and Fanconi syndrome. Muscle weakness became apparent when the patient was learning to walk. A muscle biopsy showed lipid excess in type 1 muscle fiber in a pattern consistent with carnitine deficiency. Free carnitine was determined in muscle and liver (means +standard errors): muscle, 2.29+0.05, control 17. l+l .3 nmol/mg-noncollagen protein (ncp); liver\u00b7; 1.86, control 8.24+1.22 nmol/mg ncp. Three subsequent 24 hour urine collections and midpoint serum determinations of total, free and short chain acylcarnitine were done: total carnitine, urine, 120+22.4, control 86 11mol/24 hours; serum, 9.58+0.67, control 46.l+l.8 \u00b5M. Levels of total carnitine in the blood were extremely low, approximately 20% of normals. The levels of muscle and liver carnitine were similarly decreased. In contrast the urinary levels of carnitine were elevated when compared to normals, and particularly in view of the low serum, muscle, and liver values. An L-carnitine loading test resulted in transient retention of carnitine. In this patient, the data suggest that systemic carnitine deficiency and related muscle weakness can be induced by excessive renal loss of carnitine, and may possibly be another manifestation of renal Fanconi syndrome. Furthermore, the condition may be treated with supplemental oral carnitine. DIMIT, a nonhalogenated thyroid analog, crosses the placenta and exhibits metabolic effects in the fetus. We have shown (J.

At fifteen weeks he had megaloblastic anemia and homocystinuria without hypermethioninemia and methylmalonicaciduria. There was no evidence of deficiency of folate or Vitamin 812. High dose hydroxycobalamin, but not folate, therapy resulted in rapid clinical, hematological and biochemical improvement. Cultured fibroblasts grew well in methionine but not in homocysteine without methionine. Methionine synthetase activity was normal in fibroblasts. Intracellular folate distribution and concentration were normal in fibroblasts, as was total cobalamin accumulated in radioactive Vitamin 812.

This is the first report of intracellular methylcobalamin deficiency without associated abnormality in adenosyl- The present studies were undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of subtotal pancreatectomy in 12 children (median age 3 mos, range 1 d to 12 mos) with sustained hyperinsulinemia. The diagnosis was established by simultaneous plasma glucose (27+3 mg/dl, ii:+SE) and insulin (30+6 U/ml) values. When hypoglycemic, 10 patients responded to-0 .03 mg/kg iv glucagon (6 glucose 64.:!:.6 mg/dl, range 39-100), whereas 2 did not rng/dl). 8 patients had hepatomegaly (2-7 cm below the RCM). Medical management (frequent feedings, diazoxide, iv glucose) failed to prevent symptomatic hypoglycemia and therefore all 12 underwent subtotal pancreatectomy (85-95% removal). 3 required subsequent pancreatic resection (-99%), two of whom initially failed to respond to iv glucagon. In all cases it was possible to stop iv glucose, discontinue diazoxide and/or decrease frequency of feedings. Hepatomegaly resolved in all 8. In all patients, fasting tolerance increased (by 3 to> 18 hr). One patient was cured of hypoglycemia and one who underwent near-total pancreatectomy developed diabetes. Fasting hypoglycemia can be evoked in the remaining 10 children, necessitating continued medical therapy. In summary, in children with hyperinsulinemia: 1) hepatomegaly is observed frequently; 2) pancreatic resection improves fasting tolerance. In conclusion, subtotal and even near-total pancreatectomy in young children with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia improves glucose homeostasis but is rarely curative. Studies of a female infant who developed severe vomiting, coma, hyperammonemia and hypoglycemia following a febrile illness at 1 year of age revealed evidence of a defect in ketogenesis.

Urine dicarboxylic acids were elevated at the time of acute illness. Total plasma carnitine was low prior to fasting (LO uM/L) but rose to normal with fasting (50 uM/L). Because treatment with L-carnitine failed to improve fasting ketogenesis, studies of liver tissue were done to identify the site of defect in hepatic ketogenesis. Carnitine palmityl-transferase activity was normal. Liver carnitine content (500 nM/gm) was 50% of normal. However, ketone production by fresh liver homogenate from palmityl-carnitine, octanoyl-carnitine, and octanoate was<IO% of human controls (3) while ketogenesis from butyrate and keto-isocaproa te was normal.",

It is speculated that the enzyme most likely affected is the medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. This previously unrecognized defect in fatty acid oxidation may be present in similar cases of \"carnitine deficiency\" which fail to respond to carnitine treatment and in other cases of \"atypical\" Reye's Syndrome. Cystinotic cells take up increased levels of exogenous cystine as compared to normal cells. Cystinotic cells, depleted of their cystine pools by pretreatment with cysteamine, show an uptake of 35s in 2 hours well above pretreated normals. The label in intracellular cystine, though less than in untreated cells, is higher in pretreated cells of cystinotics than in normals. Pretreatment of normal cells does not alter the 35s recovered in intracellular cystine. In pretreated cells, there is an elevated incorporation of label into intracellular cysteine. When pretreated cystinotic cells are incubated up to 24 hours in complete media, they differ suggest that it plays a role in zinc metabolism because plasma PA is decreased, kynurenine is increased, and ZnPA lowers the minimum therapeutic zinc dose to 1/3. PA may play a role in zinc absorption, or conservation. We studied 1) the ability to form PA by measuring PC, and 2) the effect of PA and other ligands on zinc transport in human fibroblasts. 1) PC activity was most pronounced in kidney, less in liver and absent in pancreas, brain and leukocytes; PC showed a steady increase from birth to 21 days, when it was higher than in adult rats (p{O.OOl);PC was higher in females than males (p40.0l); rats raised for 3 months on a tryptophan free diet had elevated PC (369% in liver,35% in kidney); and, PC was higher in lactating rats than controls (385% in liver, 35% in kidney). 2) Zinc uptake by fibroblasts was rapid during an early phase which showed saturation characteristics. Uptake during a slow second phase was concentration dependent and passive. KCN (lmM) inhibited zinc uptake the early phase. PA decreased the uptake during both phases and showed stronger inhibitory activity than equimolar concentrations of histidine and citric acid. Inhibition was 50% at a PA/ Zn ratio of 0.1/0.01 mM.

The data show that IUGR fetuses had lower plasma insulin levels than AGA, which may account for lower FA synthesis in organs listed above (p <.05). Dextrose infusion produced significant increases in plasma glucose for both IUGR and AGA fetuses despite unchanged plasma insulin concentrations. Both IUGR and AGA enhanced FA synthesis during dextrose infusion so that the IUGR fetuses synthesized FA as rapidly as the saline-infused AGA fetus.

Two siblings presented with multiple hospitalizations for cyclic vomiting and severe dehydration, beginning at approximately 5 yrs of age and precipitated by intercurrent viral infections. The severity of the syndrome warranted two admissions of the younger sib for Reye's syndrome. Gas-chromatography of l1rinary organic acids during these episodes showed massive excr0tion of a-HB(56mg%) and significant ketonuria. Plasma amino acid levels were normal except for excessive a-NH 2 -butyra te (67nmol/cc). Minimal, intermittent homocystinuria was occasionally detected by the nitroprusside reaction. The syndrome was reproduced by fasting under controlled conditions: neither sibling developed hypoglycemia; within the first 12 hrs a-HB increased 7 .6-fold(l .98mg%), while B-HB increased only twofold(0.44mg%). Oral methionine loading(lOOmg/Kg) resulted in prompt rises in plasma methionine levels and increased a-NH2butyrate into the range reported for Reye's syndrome (75nmol/cc). There was a correspondingly high level of urinary a-HB(38mg%) and ketone bodies. Propionic acid-14c conversion to C02 was normal in isolated white cell preporations from both sihs.

She was admitted for treatment of presumed neonatal sepsis; blood glucose at that time was 35 mg/dl with urinalysis negative for ketones. Physical exam was unrevealing; there was no hepatomegaly. Rehydration with 5% glucose produced a striking remission of symptoms. All cultures were negative. Gas chromatography (CC) of urine showed elevations of adipate (35 mg/dl), suberate (10.7 mg/dl) and sebacate (7.8 mg/dl); no lactate or ketone hodies were Jetectable. At 3 mos. a fasting study was performed; blood glucose fell slowly over 23 hours to 38 mg/dl; free FA increased steadily with disproportionately 1ow ketone formation: urinary adipate, suberate and scbacate increased 10-20 fold over baseline; glucagon stimulation at the end of the study failed to elicit a response.

The results suggest that enhanced protein breakdown to provide gluconeogenic amino acid precursors is responsible for growth failure of type I GSD. Glucose infusions relieve this demand thus favoring amino acid flux toward protein synthesis. Measurements of protein turnover with stable isotopes also may provide a clinically useful tool to assess the efficacy of glucose or amino acid infusions to enhance rates of growth in these children. Sodium warfarin (W) exposure during the first trimester of hunan pregnancy may result in a warfarin syndrorre which includes stippled epiphyses and nasal hypoplasia. It ias been suggested that second or third trimester exposure is associated with an increased incidence of central nervous system (CNS) defects. We investigated the teratogenicity of W the third trimester in the rat by either single injections of 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75 or 2.0 rrg W per kg body weight m day 15 of pregnancy or single daily injections of 0.25, 0.375 or 0.5 rrg of W per kg body weight m days 15, 16, 17 arxl 18.

The mly consistant effects seen were dose-dependent increases in coagulatim time arxl maternal death with increasing total close of W. As of this time we have not been able to develop an animal model to support the allegation that late gestation exposure to W results in CNS pathology in spite of the fact that the level of achninistration resulted in significant maternal death.

Ovarian failure has also been reported but poorly documented in humans. Exposure to ethyl alcohol in utero is reported to cause delayed age of menarche in FAS females, but the reproductive histories of FAS adults have not been previously studied. We examined 41 FAS mothers and their 65 offspring. Of them, five were non-drinkers, two stopped drinking after the delivery of an FAS child, and the rest were heavy ethanol abusers.

Once it was discovered that all teratogenic antisera localized in the developing yolk sac, we concluded that the yolk sac dysft.mctim was an interference with the transport of substances to and/or from the ert>ryo. o.ir studies in vivo and in vitro indicated that the target of teratogenic antibody is m macrainlecular pinocytosis with a resulting severe deficiency of amino acids available to the embryo. To confirm this hypothesis, pregnant rats were administered a teratogenic dose of antiserum that was equivalent to an enbryonic I.D/50 arxl simultaneously treated with a mixture of 16 amino acids to provide at least twice the daily requirement of amin;) acids. All litters of treated animals were completely normal as -well as having no increase in resorptions. 'This teratogenic model presents a unique arxl exciting rrodel for studying erbryonic nutrition without any effect on the nnther. At this time, we are not certain whether the teratogenesis is due to a deficiency in a single amino acid or several amino acids or to an abnormal :i.rrbalance in amino acids provided to the E!lt>ryo. In contradistinction to lll:lst teratogenic animal models, we believe this model may be important in explaining some forms of human teratogenesis. Coll., Dept. of Pathol., Phila., PA. The present study consisted of light microscope arxl electromicroscopic evaluation of the developing yolk sac, exposed in vivo, to an LD/50 dose of teratogenic antiserum. the administration of teratogenic antiserun, on the lll:lrning of the 9th day, embryonic sites were rerroved at 4-hourly intervals for the first 48 hours and 12-hourly intervals for the next 96 hours. The embryonic sites were serially sectioned arxl stained with hematoxylin and eosin and selectd material was prepared for electrm microscopy. The first evidence of pathology appeared in the embryo. Thus, dead and dying cells, as well as a decrease in the ntmber of cells, appeared in the embryo before the yolk sac manifested any changes. Secondary changes, such as avascularity of vitelline circulation, reduction in height of the visceral yolk sac endodermal cells and acc1JJUlation of excess protein in the yolk sac cavity all were present only after pathological changes appeared in the errbryo. Thus, the antibodies against visceral yolk sac have little or no direct affect m the viability of the yolk sac and there is little histopathological evidence of the proven reductim in pinocytosis produced by the teratogenic antibody. These studies further support the importance of this model for embryonic nutrition, since not only are there minimal changes in the maternal organism but the target organ itself is only ft.mctionally affected by the teratogenic antisera. ( We studied the effect of right atrial exclusion on cardiac morphogenesis. White Leghorn eggs were incubated to stages (St) 23 or 25. Access to the embryo was gained by opening a window in the shell and incising the chorion. A loop of 10-0 nylon was placed around the free portion of the primitive right atrium and tightened, diminishing right atrial volume. The embryos were reincubated, harvested at or beyond St 39, fixed in diastole and microdissected. Areas of the tricuspid, mitral, pulmonic and aortic valves were measured by planimetry from photographs. The ratio of right and left ventricular (RV /LV) size was calculated. Presence and position of VSDs were noted. The study group included 22 St 23, 22 St 25 operated (op), 33 sham-operated and 60 normal control embryos. The experimental group had a 14% incidence of infracristal VSD compared with none in the sham group. Tricuspid valve areas in op St 23 (1. 66+.24 mm2) and op St 25 (1. 41+. 24 mm2) embryos were significantly decreased (p<. OS) compared-with sham-operated controls (2. 73+1. 53 mm2). The RV/LV size ratio (0.68+.09) was also significantly smaller than controls (0. 716+0. 078) (p<-:-os). Pulmonic, aortic, and mitral valve areas were similar in experimental and control groups. We conclude right atrial volume reduction results in hypoplasia of the inflow portion of the right ventricle, presumably on the basis of intracardiac blood flow alteration. Schulman, NICHO, NIH, Bethesda, MO. The frequent association between human qalactosemia and premature ovarian failure is well documented. In an animal model for this disease the offsprinq of rats fed a hiqh qalactose diet durinq preqnancy have siqnificantly reduced numbers of oocytes (Science 214:1145, 1qA1). In contrast, testicular failure is uncommon ..,-n-galactosemia. Rats were fed a 50% qalactose diet durinq preqnancy and nursinq, and the testes were later examined and hormone levels determined in offspring. Exposure to galactose for various periods duri nq preqnancy, throuqhout the entire qestation, or postnatally to nursing mother until pups were 5 weeks of aqe did not produce siqnificant differences from control body weight, seminiferous tubular diameter, or microscopic appearance of the testes when the offspring were adults (66 or 127 days). Serum LH, FSH, and testosterone (Tl levels (mean i SEM) were determined 127 days postnata lly, and no si qnifi cant differences from controls were observed in any of the treatment qroups (prenatal qalactose: LH 34.4 \u00b1 7.3 nq/ml, FSH 307 i 27 nq/ml, T 632 \u00b1 153 nq/dl; postnatal qalactose: LH 32.0 \u00b1 10.1, FSH 320 \u00b1 40.1, T 2qo \u00b1 40; controls: LH 35.9 i 13.6, FSH 344 \u00b1 23; T 449 \u00b1 54.4). Blood qalactose and qalactose-1-phosphate levels in animal receiving the qalactose diet were comparable to levels observed in human galactosemia. Our demonstration of a persistent reduction in oocyte number in the rat following prenatal exposure to a hiqh qalactose diet contrasts sharply with the apparent lack of corresponding effects by qalactose or its metabolites on the male gonad. We studied the effect of a timed teratogenic intervention on ventricular septation and great vessel formation in stage 18, 21 and 24 chick embryos. A loop of 10-0 nylon suture was tied to constrict the midpoint of the conotruncus. The loop was left in place either permanently for 24 or 4 hours, or placed and removed as a sham control. The shells were sealed with parafilm, and the embryos were incubated and harvested at stages 35 to 40. The hearts were fixed in diastole and microdissected. The study groups included 252 experimental, 82 sham-operated, and 72 normal control embryos. Data were analyzed by chi-square method for proportions. The incidence of infra-cristal ventricular septa( defects was directly related to the duration of conotruncal constriction (p<.001) with an equal proportion of defects observed in the permanent-loop group of each stage. Ventricular septa! defects occurred in stage 18 but not in stage 21 or 24 sham-operated group. The spectrum of great vessel anomalies included aortic arch interruption, hypoplasia, coarctation and double aortic arch. The incidence of great vessel anomalies was directly related to the duration of loop constriction but less than that of ventricular septa! defects. Great vessel anomalies were significantly more frequent (p<.01) in stage 21 embryos (34%) than in stage 18 (14%) or stage 24 (14%). We conclude the critical period for mechanical interference of ventricular septation includes stages 18 to 24 while that -for aortic arch malformation centers around stage 21. Over a period of three years about 30 Great Lakes Whitefish were dissected. The fish weighed between approximately two and five pounds. Each fish was noted to have a smooth firm glistening 11 tumor 11 in the pyloric area of the stomach. Histologic examination of cross sections through the whitefish pylorus revealed a leiyomyomatous hyperplasia of the circular muscle layer. The longitudinal muscle was not noticeably enlarged. The histology of pyloric stenosis in the whitefish is not dissimilar from that seen in the human infant with pyloric stenosis.",

In mothers, significant positive correlations were found between their alcohol intake and their hair zinc plasma zinc and serum albumin. Significant inverse correlations existed between alcohol intake and the infant's gestational age, birth weight and length. Correlations did not exist between alcohol intake and maternal height, weight, triceps skin-fold thickness, hematocrit, serum iron, ferritin, vitamin A or total proteins. Maternal plasma and hair zinc and infant hair zinc were similar between controls and drinkers. Of the 28 controls, 30 moderate (<60ml ETOH/day) and 20 heavy (\"'60ml ETOH) drinking mothers, mean palpebral fissure width was 6.7 and 6.0 cm, respectively (p<0.05). Features of FAS were more frequent in the infants of both maternal drinking qroups. We conclude that in this study group, zinc and other parameters of nutriture were similar amonq drinking and control mothers and their infants. FAS may have a familial component and is quantitatively related to maternal alcohol intake. Early studies of teratogenic antiserun concentrated en demonstrating a direct ellhryotoxic effect or an indirect ellhryotoxic effect frcrn resulting maternal imn.mologic disease. Neither of these hypotheses was true, since teratogenic antiserum localized primarily in the yolk sac. The nature of the yolk sac dysfunction has been the concern of our laboratory and the folexperiments were carried out. Enbryos aged 9.5 days were cultured in vitro for 40 hours and were exposed to either teratogenic f5tisera or normal rabbit serum. Transport studies utilizing 1 I-labelled polyvinylpyrrolidine substrate or JH:leucine-labelled serun proteins were carried out. The presence of the antiserun decreased the protein content of the conceptus Yhen oompared to the control ellhryos. The pinocytotic uptake of the serun proteins was decreased by the antiserum. Quantitative conparison between in vitro and in vivo studies reveal that malformations are not produced in the developing embryos until the antibody concentration produces a reduction in pinocytosis. This substantiates the previous findings that macromolecular pinocytosis is the main if rot exclusive source of amiro acids to the developing ennryo early organogenesis and that interference with an adequate source of amino acids can result in embryopathology an:! teratogenesis.

Recognition of the disruptive vascular pathogenesis of some cases of unilateral terminal transverse limb reduction defects explains the negligible recurrence risk and should focus attention on careful evaluation of the placenta in such cases. In order to clarify our understanding about the mechanism of action of teratogenic antisera, our laboratory has attempted to isolate and characterize those antigens which produce the antisera. Preparative flatbed isoelectric focusing (IEF) in granulated gel pH= 3-10 ampholytes was used to separate proteins from 19th day rat visceral yolk sac 0/YS). After IEF the gel bed was divided into 3 equal segments. Antisera produced against segment 1 (pH 3-5) were rot teratogenic. Antisera raised against segment 2 (\u00b5t 5-7) and 3 (\u00b5t 7-9.0) produced severe congenital malformations Yhen injected into 9th day pregnant rats. Fractions 2 and 3 were further refocused, pH= 7-9 and pH= 5-7 ampholytes and individual protein-containing bands were eluted with PBS.

A fraction containing glycoprotein was eluted with 20 rrM-.,l -methyl mannoside. Both fractions produced potent teratogenic antibodies. These studies show that the VYS contains a multiplicity of antigens \\.hich can stimulate the production of teratogenic antibodies. At least one teratogenantigen present in the VYS appears to be glycoprotein in nature. Fraction 3 from IEF is the least complex and is being used for the isolati<X'l of antigens. An infant with ectopia cordis with absent sternum remained dependent on mechanical assisted ventilation at 4 months of age because of decreased chest wall stability. The anterior chest wall was comprised only of skin, and collapsed inward with each inspiration. An anterior chest wall prosthesis was fabricated from a polyether urethane coated dacron mesh and surgically implanted. Tidal volume (Vt; ml), trans-pulmonary pressure (Ptp; cmH20), and intraesophageal pressure (Ppl; cmH20) during spontaneous breathing; maximal Ppl and transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi; cmH20) against an occluded airway; and dynamic pulmonary (Cpul; ml/cmH20) and chest wall (Ccw; ml/cmH20) compliance were measured at 3 weeks before and 2 months after surgery. Tidal volume and all pressures increased following surgery (P < 0.001). Ccw fell, indicating increased stability, after surgery. The prosthesis provided ample chest wall stability to permit the infant to be weaned from mechnnical assisted ventilation while awake. serun, gassed with 95% Oz/5% COz and j.r:icubated in a shaking waterbath for 0-4 hours at 37oC with 14c-AIB (Tracer dose).

This finding is surprising in view of the fact that the major cellular component of the PYS, i.e. the giant trophoblast cell, is known to be very active phagocytically. Since previous studies have indicated that specific antisera prepared against the VYS are nuch more teratogenic than antisera prepared against the PYS, we now have a biochemical explanation for this difference, in that macr()[lk)lecular transport across the PYS is probably not accomplished by pinocytosis.

In a recent study we have implicated myocardial cytodiffercntiation, specifically contractile protein synthesis, as a requirement for normal heart morphogenesis. To test the hypothesis that unequal rates of cytodiffcrcntiation may be responsible for cardiac asymmetry, we measured the net accumulation of myosin (M) in myocardial cells derived from the Rand L sides during tubular heart formation and looping. Total M was measured in cells isolated from R and L hearts of experimentally produced cardiac bifid chi ck embryos. At least 50 eel ls from each R and L heart were measured, and a total of 18 halves of 9 primitive hearts were used. M was measured using indirect immunofluorcscence labeling and microspectrophotometric measurement of fluorescence. There was no significant difference in rate of M accumulation between cells from R and I. hearts (p = 0. 43). M distribution, measured in frozen sections using fluorescent antibody, was also uniform in both R and L hearts. We conclude that phcnotypic expression is highly synchronized throughout the myocardium.

In contrast to the first infant, dysmorphic features, including frontal bossing, increased inner canthal distance, broad nasal bridge and prominent gingivae, were observed. Mild developmental delay was noted at ten months of age. Fetal bromism in association with microccphaly, growth retardation and congenital heart disease has been reported in three infants exposed throughout pregnancy. There are no other reported instances of congenital malformatio1 or dysmorphic features in infants exposed to bromide prenatally These infants illustrate the differential neonatal effects of fetal exposure to bromide at different stages of gestation. The importance of environmental and occupational exposure during pregnancy is clear. The early embryonic heart is attached to the embryo by means of the dorsal mesocardium (DM). During normal development, the DM ruptures, enabling the primitive heart to bend and rotate. The mechanism responsible for DM rupture is unknown. lfo examined the morphologic sequences of DM rupture by scanning electronmicroscopy, using 20 dissected chick embryo hearts at varying stages of development. At stage 12-(15 somites), tiny perforations start to appear in the Q\\1 at a level slightly rostral to the mid-heart. By stage 13-(18 somites), the entire mid-rostral 1/3 of the heart is freed of dorsal attachment. At later stages, the perforations extend rostrally and caudally until the DM disappears completely, the site of the former CT-I being marked hy a low ridge of myocardial cells. We tested experimentally the hypothesis that the DM ruptures because of applied tension imposed upon it by the adjacent splanchnic mesoderm (SM). Using 17 cultured embryos (stage 11-, 12 somites), tension in the intact DM was relieved by cutting longitudinally the adjacent SM. This resulted in wide separation of the cut edges, thus relieving stress. Despite the relief in SM stress, the DM developed perforations normally and eventually ruptured. Our study suggests that normal DM rupture does not result from applied tension but is rather an intrinsically regulated event. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency and natural history of hematological abnormalities in newborns with Down syndrome. 73 newborns with Down syndrome (documented by karyotype) were ascertained from our hospital between 1965-1981, and their newborn records were reviewed. In 20 cases no complete blood count (CBC) was recorded. Jn 17 cases a CBC was normal. Jn 36 cases there was a hematological abnormality includin9 26 cases of polycythemia (peripheral hematocrit greater than 70), three cases of leukocytosis (white blood cell count qreater than 34,000), three cases of thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 100,000), one case of thrombocytosis (platelet count greater than 400,000), and three cases of concomitant polycythemia and thrombocytopenia. While some of these babies were evaluated for neoplasia or sepsis, there was a total resolution of the hematolo9ical abnormality within two weeks without evidence of malignancy or infection.",

            "text": "We conclude that hematolo9ical abnormalities which show a benign natural history are conmon in Down syndrome newborns, with a minimum incidence of 50% (36/73). The finding of a hematological abnormality in a newborn suspected of having Down syndrome is further evidence for the diagnosis of Down syndrome. Maternal serum AFP screening in routine pregnancy is a valuable method for the prenatal detection of open neural tube defects (NTD) and some other congenital anomalies. Since diabetic pregnancy outcome is known to be associated with an increased incidence of congenital malformations, we assessed the value of AFP screening in these high risk pregnancies. From 1975-81 we studied 396 diabetic pregnancies, obtaining second trimester serum samples in 90%. We confirmed that pregnant diabetics have lower serum AFP. These values, equivalent to those found 2 weeks earlier in gestation in non-diabetics, suggest the use of a separate AFP reference curve. The remarkable observed frequency of NTD was 22.7/1000 (a 10-20-fold increase), while that for all major anomalies was 11.1%. All 9 of the open NTD were probably detectable by AFP screening, but in only 4 were sera obtained. Maternal sera were studied in only 62.9% of the 35 with major non-NTD anomalies, none having high AFP. Data analysis of ultrasound (U/S) detection of the major anomalies is in progress and was potentially useful in 18/44 cases. Examples were encountered in which careful U/S missed NTD which were subsequently detected because of AFP screening. While awaiting further data analysis, early indications are that both second trimester serum AFP screening and U/S are valuable adjuncts for the management of diabetic pregnancy and moreover have complementary roles. The spectrum of defects resulting from early amnion rupture is now to include craniofacial defects, limb reductions, body wall deficiency, scoliosis, and growth retardation. Concurrence of craniofacial and limb defects with body wall deficiency has been reported in nearly every series describing deformation abnormalities, but the role of the amniotic membrane in produ:tfo;. of this colllllon constellation has not been precisely defined. Alerted by sonographic evidence of fetal abnormalities, we were able to document fetal, membrane, and placental relationships at birth in three cases of membrane disruption. All three had abdominal wall deficiencies through which liver and intestine protruded external to the amnion. All three had club feet. Two had craniofacial defects underlying adherent membrane histological ly identified as amnion. The third delivered ensheathed by an essentially intact amniotic membrane covering the entire body except the protruding viscera. Simple puncture of fetal membranes has been reported to produce deformation abnormalities in animals. On the basis of our observations and repeated reports of similar cas.",

The human preterm newborn is susceptible to both hemorrhagic & thrombotic events but is, on balance, in a hypercoagulagle state. Small sick preterm infants often require indwelling catheters with the attendant risk of thrombus formation about the catheter tip. To prevent this, heparin is often added to parenteral and flush solutions to a final concentration of approximately 1 unit/ml. Be\u00b7 cause the clearance of heparin varies greatly especially in small sick infants, a microheparin assay is needed. We have developed such an assay. 50 lamda of plasma are rinsed into a buffer solution containing all necessary clotting factors. Excess thrombin is added and the of clotting are recorded in the Sonoclot Coagulation Analyzer\u00ae (Sienco Inc.). Presence of heparin slows down the rate of fibrin formation. The concentration of heparin in the infant's plasma is determined from a standard curve calibrated with known heparin standards. A circulating heparin level of 0.04 to 0.1 units/ml is functionally equivalent to a PTT ofl\\/40 to 60 seconds. This is a range which should minimize the likelihood of clotting and yet avoid increasing the risk of bleeding. Heparin levels in 20 sick preterm infants with indwelling catheters were assayed. Only 3 were found to be in ideal range; 7 were too high; 10 were too low. This study demonstrates that many infants are at a greater than necessary risk of both thrombosis and hemorrhage. In addition, misinterpretation of the cause of bleeding (DIC rather than excessive heparin) could lead to inappropriate Rx (plasma} resulting in increased risk of intraventricular liemorrha2e. 68 VLBH neonates and 109 neonates (120l-2000g) with severe RDS Q'.,kxR, Fi0 2 > .5, IMV) were evaluated for the presence of a PDA (clinical exam, echocardiography LA/Ao> 1.2, pulse Doppler, flush aortography).",

A new technique to assess the pulmonary status of critically ill neonates employs a low dead space ( 2cc ) valve interfaced into the ventilator circuit allowing rebreathing and non-rebreathing modes. Parameters measured are effective pulmonary blood flow (QEP, L/min), lung tissue fluid (Vt, cc), diffusion (DL, cc/cm/min) and functional residual capacity (FRC, cc.) The test gases are 10% Helium, 0.5% 0.3% Carbon Monoxide balanced with Oxygen and Nitrogen. The concentrations of the gases are measured by a mass spectrometer and analyzed by a microcomputer. This has been used in 16 neonates with HMD, PFC, chronic lung disease and a variety of cardiovascular diseases. A neonate, mechanically ventilated for PFC, was tested with various modes of therapy: hyperventilation, tubocurarine, leg wraps and tolazoline ( 14.61 45.23 Improvements in QEP resulted from hyperventilation (+9%) or with tubocurarine (+4%) but more favorably with tolazoline (+18%.) Vt increased with leg wraps (+14%), used to reduce the hypotensive effects of the medications, suggesting a tendency to develop an increase in interstitial lung water and/or pulmonary edema. FRC improved with hyperventilation (+19%.) This rebreathing technique is sensitive in assessing pulmonary dysfunction and therapy. The effect of PEEP on the FRC of 14 ventilated neonates (10 RDS and 4 Pn) was evaluated. A total of 48 FRC determinations were made. Initial measurements were made at the clinically prescribed level of PEEP. PEEP was then varied by 2cmH20 over the range of 2 to 8cmH20. Infants with clinically severe RDS (Gr I) showed a markedly reduced initial FRC; whereas, infants with mild to moderate RDS (II) had an FRC at the lower limits of normal. In infants with Pn, FRC was initially at the upper limits of normal (TABLE) . As PEEP was changed, the 6FRC/2cmH20 PEEP changed by a significantly greater margin if initial FRC were low-normal or sliqhtly elevated. These data indicate that chanqes in PEEP in infants with RDS will effect lunq volumes more if FRC is within normal ranges and will have little effect at low lung volumes. Infants with Pn have significantly greater lung volumes than infants with RDS and show the greatest change in volume for a given change in PEEP. When Level III nurseries accept outborn infants, their neonatal mortality, morbidity and long-term outcome could depend on practices at the birth hospital. The study presented herein shows a wide variation in neonatal morbidity associated with the hospital of birth.",

This pattern of states was seen in infants fed both formula and human milk, in SGA infants, and in infants with patent ductus arteriosus. Infants given theophylline for apnea had their waking time reduced (from 14% to 5%) and the REM time augmented (from 4 7% to 56%).

We obtained tracheal aspirates (TA) during the first eight hours of life from male infants with respiratory distress and other risk factors for fetal infection. We determined if the tracheal polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) were of fetal or maternal origin using quinacrine fluorescence. We tested for an association between the presence of fetal cells to positive TA or blood cultures, neutropenia, and increased immature/total neut roph i l ( l/T) ratios. El even of 15 newborns had predominantly male PMNs (57\u00b19% fluorescent cells) while four babies had fewer male PMNs (29\u00b14% fluorescent cells), p<0.001. PMNs from normal adult males and females had 55-65% and 13-15% fluorescence, respectively. Gastric aspirates were obtained in eight babies. Seven had predominantly female PMNs and one an intermediate number. Seven TA were culture positive consisting of four babies with congenital pneumonia and three colonized infants. Two infants with congenital pneumonia had positive blood cultures. These infants had normal leukocyte counts, increased l/T ratios, but low numbers of PMNs on their TA which may have placed them at risk for dissemination. Eight TA were culture negative including four with large numbers of fetal cells. The presence of fetal cells in TA were not associated with positive TA or blood cultures, neutropenia, or increased l/T ratios. TA PMNs were predominantly fetal. The presence of these cells was not specific for bacteremia or congenital pneumonia, and in certain infants, may be indicative of non-bacterial inflaotnation. (36) excised, separated canine pulmonary lobes were studied. Meconia were blended in normal saline to produce a solution of 10% and 20%. They were either filtered or centrifuged and then instilled endobronchially into the canine lobes. The Quasi-Static pressurevolume de flat ion curve of each lobe was determined before and 4 hours after instillation of either normal saline or meconium solutions. The results showed that in the saline controlled group (8 lobes), the curve was essentially unchang0d before and after instillation of saline. In the 10% filtered meconium solution group (14 lobes), the curve was markedly depressed especially at the transpulmonary airway pressure of 10 (p<0.06) and 5 cm H 2 n (p<0.005). In the 10% centrifuged meconium solution group (6 lobes) the result was similar. In the 20% filtered meconium solution group (8 lobes), the lobes exhibited similar but not significantly greater depression of the pressure-volume curve than that of 10% solution groups. It is concluded that meconium contains an agent or agents that can inhibit the pulmonary surfactant.",

In addition most of our chest tubes are placed by pediatric surgeons. Maternal hypotension either spontaneous or associated with regional anesthesia is a potentially serious complication during labor. We have investigated the response of both mother and fetus to this insult by studying vasoactive substances during experimental hypotension in the pregnant sheep. The maternal hypotension was induced by nitroprusside infusion. Fetal and maternal vasoactive substances were measured in 5 chronically instrumented fetal lambs. During hypotension, mean maternal BP fell 20% (p<.Ol), while mean fetal BP, heart rate, and arterial blood gas values remain unchanged. Secretion of maternal vasopressin (VP) increased by a factor of 30 (p<.Ol) and renin activity (R) by a factor of 5 (p<.05). Fetal VP increased 5-fold (p<.Ol) while R increased only slightly. Similarly, maternal and fetal catecholamines increased but also without statistical significance. Significant correlation was observed between fetal and maternal levels of VP (r = .69), R (r = .52), epinephrine (r = .55), norepinephrine (r = .81), and total cate cholamine (r = .79). In summary, mild nitroprusside-induced maternal hypotension greatlv stimulated release of VP and R in the pregnant ewe while the fetus is able to maintain its BP and blood gases mainly by a moderate elevation of VP.

We tested the hypothesis that the ability of these children to breathhold until cyanotic and unconscious relates to blunted ventilatory sensitivity to hypoxemia or hypercapnia.

Responses We measured the rates of 0-consumption of a patient age-and doubling number-matched pair of cystic fibrosis (CF) and normal fibroblast cultures, by both intact cells and digitoninpermeabilized cells in the presence and absence of oligomycin or oligomycin and 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP). Basal 02 consumption did not differ between the CF and normal cultures, and gradually ingreased with culture age from about 3.5 to 8.0 natoms D2/min/ 10 cells. Respiratory control ratios (DNP-stimulated rate/ oligomycin-inhibited rate) with Na succinate as substrate remained relatively constant at 2.5 4.0 throughout each culture's lifespan. Total cellular Mg +and ca++ contents increased 3.5 to 5.0-fold during the aging of both lines. Although both ca++ and Mg++ seemed higher for CF than for control cells, the ratio (Ca +)/(Mg++) was higher at all points in the lifespan of CF fibroblasts, suggesting elevated ca++ in CF cells. Since CF cells grew significantly more slowly after only 4 doublings and stopped growing after 26 doublings compared to doublings for the control cells, cation differences may reflect early senescence in CF cells. The findings of increased ca++ in CF cells but normal respiratory control suggest a defect inca++ efflux from CF cells at the mitochondrial or plasma membrane.

Intermittent mandatory ventilation (IM V) with positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) and peak inflation pressure (PIP) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of pneumopericardium. To investigate the signllicance of PIP in pneumopericardium, 13 premature neonates (BW 1.25-2.90 kg, GA 29-38 wks) developing pneumopericardium while receiving mechanical ventilation for RDS were reviewed. Respiratory support OMV, PEEP, PIP, Fi02) and severity of disease (pH, PaC02, and Pa02/Fi02 ratio) were analyzed. Mean values for each parameter were calculated for 15 eight hour periods prior to the onset of pneumopericardium. The time from starting infants on IMV to the occurrence of pneumopericardium ranged Ii hrs to 13 days (mean 6.11 days). Ten infants developed pneumopericardium by Ii& hrs. At the time of pneumopericardium, all infants had high PIP (mean 112, range 26-60 torr). Mean PIP increased significantly from 30 ! I 0 S.D. torr 16 hr before pneumopericardium to 112 ! & torr just prior to the onset of pneumopericardium (p <-.05)",

Three girls had temporary regression; 7 had irregular vaginal bleeding. Serum LH & FSH in 4 were prepubertal levels. One who menstruated regularly had a prepubertal response to LHRH & minimal suppression with estradiol & provera. Two patients have each had 2 normal children. Adult heights of 5 range from 159 to 176cm, within 3.3cm of predictions based on parent's heights. Two patients had thyrotoxicosis & I acromegaly. Thirteen had cafe-au-lait spots, ten had polyostotic fibrous dysplasia. All had progression of bone lesions during childhood, 6 had one or more pathologic fractures, none after age 18. In the nine patients with both bone and skin findings the laterality of the skin lesion was concordant with the bone lesion in 5 instances. Findings suggest that the severity, and even presence, of the three classic criteria of the McCune-Albright Syndrome vary considerably. Gonadotropins are not consistent with hypothalamicpituitary maturation. Bony lesions did not progress after growth was complete; skin lesions, with an exception, did not progress after birth; and the laterality of these lesions was poorly concordant. 371 THE EFFECTS OF CASTRATION ON PULSATILE GONDAOTROPIN SECRETION DURING SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE MALE SUBHUMAN PRIMATE.

Chandrika. Linda Lawrence. and Jane Baggett. (Spon.by H. Maurer) Medical College of Virginia, Department of Pediatrics, Richmond. 135 newborns were cultured for CMV on admission and weekly after 4 weeks of age until discharge. 6 (all weighing <1100 gms.) acquired CMV while hospitalized. Mothers of all infected infants were CMV seronegative ELISA). 50% of all infants were born to seronegative mothers. The risk of a seronegative infant weighing <1200 gms. of acquiring CMV was 50%. There was no correlation between length of hospitalization and birth weight for all in-\u00b7 fants hospitalized over 30 days. There was a significant correlation (p<0.0001) between the number of blood donors for an inf ant and the acquisition of CMV. Infected infants received blood from >8 donors prior to CMV shedding. Infected infants received blood from an average of 6.6 CMV antibody + donors while uninfected inf ants <1200 gms. received blood from an average of 3.3 CMV antibody + donors. Seronegative mothers are unlikely to have infected their infants. No infant received non-maternal breast milk. Restriction enzyme analysis of all isolates is being completed to exclude infant to infant transmission. After acquiring CMV, 2 infants died (only 1 autopsied and had proven disseminated CMV), 2 developed clinically significant hepatitis, and 1 developed pneumonia and hepatitis. These results strongly suggest that acquired infections are a significant risk to the infants <1200 gms. born to seronegative mothers and the source of this infection is seropositive blood donors.

Groups of normal infants and children in a closed institution in Japan were immunized subcutaneously (S/C) or via inhalation (I/N) with OKA strain of live attenuated VZV vaccine in a dose ranging from 50 to 2500 PFU of the vaccine virus. The immunized subjects, non-immunized seronegative and previously infected seropositive subjects (controls) were foll.owed through four epidemics of VZV infection in this institution over a period of five years. No subjects with prior natural VZV infection developed varicella during subsequent VZV outbreaks. However, 100\\ of seronegative subjects developed varicella during exposure. Of particular importance is the observation that 10\\ (17/178) VZV vaccinated subjects developed varicella during re-exposure. The development of varicella in such immunized subjects was limited to those who had been vaccinated with either <80 PFU of the S/C vaccine or <800 PFU of the I/N vaccine. These observations suggest that vaccination with VZV vaccine in a dose over >800 PFU offers 100% protection against heavy exposure to wild virus even under closed institutional settings.

Excess IND prevents surfactant phosphatidylglycerol synthesis, and decreases the capacity of surfactant to stabilize airways at birth. The importance of high IND is not known. Previous studies suggest that INO is synthesized in the fetus. In the present study we measured INO in 1) fetal serum during elective cesarean section at term; 2) infant feedings; 3) serum from premature infants. 1) INO in sera from umbilical artery (UA) and umbilical vein (UV) were as follows (n=S): IND in UA IND in UV UV-UA Gestational age IND (mM; mean\u00b1SEM) 0.11\u00b10.01 0. 16\u00b10.03 0.05\u00b10.01 40\u00b11 weeks 2) Dietary IND concentrations were as follows: Breast milk 2.5 (range 0.6-5.6)mM (n=22); Infant formulas 0.3 (0.0-0.5)mM (n=4); parenteral nutrition 0.2 (0.0-0.3)mM (n=4). 3) Premature infants were fed with breast milk (SM), formula (IF), or were on parenteral nutrition (PN).

School, Massachusetts General Hospital, Department of Pediatrics and Medicine, Boston, MA. 02114Although hormonal changes of pregnancy and lactation appear to influence the transport of plgA into breast milk, the effect of these hormones on transport of pigA and IgA immune complexes across other epithelial surfaces has not been determined. In this study we examined whether the hormonal changes of pregnancy and lactation affect the hepatobiliary transport of pigA in the formof IgA antibody-antigen complexes. After cannulation of the common bile duct, adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were examined at day 20 of pregnancy (P-20) or day 1 of lactation (L-1), and were compared to non-pregnant, non-Jartating controls (C). plgA-antidinitrophenyl (DNP) antibody was prepared from the ascitic fluid of mL-e bearing the :IOPC-Jl5 plasmacytoma. Antibody was injected intravenously immediately followed by the antigen, l25r-DNP10-bovine serum albumin. Timed serum and bile samples were analyzed for trichloracetic acid, ammonium sulfate and immunoprecipitable radioactivity. The clearance of IgA immune complexes from serum in P-20 and L-1 animals was significantly more rapid than in controls. The appearance of IgA immune complexes in bile was 7 to 15 fold h'!;her in P-20 and L-1 animals than in controls. These observations in lactating and pregnan1\u00b7 animals suggest that the hormonal milieu influences the hepatobiliary transport of plgA and therefore may be an important modulator of the secretory component-mediated vesicular transport of secretory immunoglobulin. 518 IS MOTHER'S MILK NUTRITIONALLY ADEQUATE FOR HER PREMA-TURE INFANT?

To evaluate the interactions of diet, genetic and hormones in inducing these changes, small intestinal development was followed in rats from 17 to 28 days of age. Pups weaned at 17 days or nursed until 25 days were compared to control weaned rats of the same age. Pups weaned at 17 days showed an immediate increase in intestinal length but no change in segmental mucosa! weight, DNA and protein contents. They showed an immediate decrease in lactase and a precocious increase in sucrase and maltase between days 19 to 22. At 19 days, early weaned pups had serum corticosteroid levels about 3x that of control or prolonged nursed pups. Pups nursed to 25 days had smaller body weight, shorter intestinal length, lighter mucosa, and lower mucosal protein content. They also showed a delayed increase in sucrase and maltase and a sustained higher level of lactase at day 25. Enterokinase and leucine aminopeptidase showed little changes. Significant increases in mucosa! mass, DNA and protein content were seen in all animals at day 25 when compared to 17 day old pups.

However, P infants had a mean 25HD of 1.1\u20220.5 ng/ml (\u00b1SEM), significantly below the means of the other groups (A 10.2\u00b12.0, p<.01; B 7.l!l.7, p<.01; C 15.J\u2022l.4, p<.001). C infants had higher 25HD levels thnn A and B infants (C 15.J!l.4 vs A+ B 8.5\u20221.J ng/ml, p<.01). Despite the 251!0 findings in infants, no intergroup differences were observed for Ca, Pi, AP; all being within normal range. SimilnrJ.y, Ca, Pi, AP were normal. This study clearly shows that Dor metabolites cross in breast milk, but in the absence of maternal or infant supplementation, the infant becomes D deficient in the first 6 weeks of life. Even in sunny climates, if milk supply not D fortified, supplemental n to nursing infants seems prudent. PREALBUMIN: A SENSITIVE INDEX OF DISEASE ACTIVITY IN 57':J INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE. Fred C.

Animals who were not pretreated with taurine prior to an I.V. injection of 180 body weight of S-LCA showed numerous cytoplasmic vacuoles with normal bile canaliculi and a striking reduction of bile flow to less than 207. of values obtained in controls. In contrast, the group who had taken taurine for various periods before the S-LCA injection no histological changes and no decrease in bile flow. These data indicate that dietarytaurine increases bile flow, bile acid secretion and exerts a protective effect against cholestasis induced by monohydroxy bile acids.

Seven children aged ll to 19 years who, during the first few months of life, developed a celiac-like syndrome were recently studied. Psychomotor retardation (1/7), absent reflexes (2/7), abnormal electrooculograms (3/7) and electroretinograms (1/7) were noted. All were hypocholesterolemic (70.1\u00b15.8 mg/dl).

Praful C. Shah, Serem Freier, Byung H. Park, Ping-C Lee, and Emanuel Lebenthal. Department of Pediatrics. Children's Hospital and SUNY at Buffalo, Buffalo, N.Y. Complexing of food protein by IgA antibodies hns been shown to improve the efficiency of proteolysis. The coordinated secretion of antibodies and proteolytic enzymes would therefore be advantageous. We investigated the possibility that PZ-CCK and S, which are known to release pancreatic enzymes, fluid and bicarbonate, also increase the amount of food specific antibody. Duodenal fluid was collected before and after administration of PZ-CCK and S. Protein content, proteolytic enzyme and antibody activities against 5 milk proteins were measured. ELISA were developed for the detection of IgA, M, and G antibodies against -<-casein, oC-lactalbumin, bovine serum albumin, B-lactoglobulin A and B. Both IgA and IgM antibodies showed significant response to PZ-CCK and S. After PZ-CCK, IgA and IgM antibody activities rose 6-fold and reached peak levels in 5-10 minutes. The increase in antibody activity against the milk proteins the increase in protein content and proteolytic enzyme activity. In spite of the known dilutional effect of S on duodenal fluid enzyme concentration, a parallel decrease in antibodies was not seen. Instead, S produced a 4-fold rise of IgA antibodies and a 16-fold rise of IgM antibodies. It is suggested that the secretion of PZ-CCK and S following food intake may increase the availability of antibodies to food proteins in the GI tract.

Analysis of the data by body systems associated with traditional subspecialty designations revealed similar findings. In general the variability was far greater within than between disease categories. This suggests that children and families faced with a given condition do not as a group have a characteristic profile.

Dept of Pediatrics and Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota Findings from several large scale nutrition surveys in U.S. have found blacks have lower Hgb or Hct values than white (up to 2.6% in Hct), which leads to the suqgestion of separate criteria of anemia for blacks. In current study, using the case control method, 425 black and 164 American Indian children werematched with equal number of white children for sex, age, and iron nutrition status based on serum ferritin to compare Hct. Black children have a mean Hct 0.7% lower than that of white, matched controls (p < O. 001), but no difference exists between American Indian children and their white controls. This findinq is consistent with previous series the magnitude of the Hct difference is the smallest reported. The lower Hct in black children can mostly be accounted for by the calculated incidence of heterozygus hemoglobinopathies which have lower Hct values than normal blacks, i.e. thalassemia trait and sickle cell trait. Since the hemoglobin limiting condition only exists in a subset of black population which res\\!ltecl in a slight but significant lowering effect on Hgb or Hct for the entire group, the use of the same diagnostic criteria of anemia for all races will enable a unifoI11l detection of nutrition anemia as well as greater diagnostic rate of hereditary hernoglobinopathies. In the case of a black child found anemic, the possibility of factors other than iron deficiency should be considered, especially if there is no significant Hgb or Hct response after a trial course of oral iron therapy. 660 HEIGHT AND WEIGHT STATUS OF INDOCHINESE REFUGEE \u2022 CHILDREN IN COMPARISON WITH U.S. REFERENCE STANDARDS.

Invest. 61, 163-170, 1978)  as well as in the family reported here support X-linked inheritance.This family includes an affected girl (karyotype 46,XX) and boy who are step-first cousins (their mothers maternal half-sisters). These two patients in addition to the two reported by Guggenheim et al. (Annals of Neural. 7, 1980) exhibit adrenal insufficiency, documented by pathological observation of adrenal hypoplasia in two and by functional testing of glucocorticoid and mineralcorticoid responses in two. The girl died of brain death following hypoglycemia at six months of age. Her fibroblasts have markedly diminished oxidation of c 111 -glycerol to c 1 \"-carbon dioxide (ca. 3% of controls) and a deficiency of GK activity (ca. 6% of controls). These findings are consistent with close linkage of the loci for GK and adrenal hypoplasia on the X-chromosome, but do not rule out the possibility of an etiologic relationship between these associated observations with phenotypic and/or genotypic variability explaining the clinically different families.

This susceptibility is a necessary but not sufficient component of the diabetic syndrome. Gene products of the RT! or of genes linked to the RTl appear to modify expression of the susceptibility.

David R. Cox and Richard D. Palmiter, (Spon. by Charles J. Epstein), Department of sity of California, San Francisco, California and Department of Biochemistry, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington. We have used 16 Chinese hamster x mouse somatic cell hybrid clones to assign Mt-1 to mouse chromosome 8. Mouse MT-1 mRNA was measured by solution hybridization using a cloned mouse MT-I DNA probe and conditions such that hamster MT mRNA did not hybridize with the probe. Mouse MT-I mRNA segregated concordantly with mouse glutathione reductase, an enzyme marker for mouse chromosome 8, but showed discordant segregation with enzyme markers for 15 other mouse chromosomes. Karyotype analysis of 8 informative hybrid clones, combined with Southern blot analysis of DNA from these clones, confirmed the assignment of mouse Mt-l to chromosome 8. Menke's disease (MD) in man and the mottl-;;-d (Mo) mutation in the mouse, which provides an animal model of MD, are both Xlinked degenerative neurologic disorders thought to result frtlm abnormal copper homeostasis. Since ahnormal accumulation of copper is associated with an increased amount of metallothionein in both MD and Mo fibroblasts, it has been suggested that MD and Mo are due to a metallothionein gene mutation. Our result demonstrates that a mutation in the mouse MT-1 structural gene or a closely linked regulatory gene is not tl1e primary defect in Mo, and implies that an Mt-1 mutation is not the genetic defect in human MD.

Plasma L-Dopa and its metabolites were measured by a radioenzymatic technic in 12 children with NB and in 12 other children with different malignancies (control group). The average values for Plasma L-Dopa, Dopamine and norepinephrine were 44.8 ng/ml, 420.4 Pg/ml and 1404 Pg/ml respectively in children with NB, as compared to 1.67 ng/ml, 36.6 Pg/ml, and 227 Pg/ml for the control group. Urinary catecholamines were measured in 24 hour urine 10 patients and they were elevated in on1y 6 patients. However, plasma L-Dopa, Dopamine and Norepinephrine were significantly elevated in 11 of the 12 children with NB. Follow-up determinations of !.-Dopa and its metabolites correlated with the clinical course of the patients. Measurement of Plasma L-Dopa, Dopamine and Norepinephrine by this technic is a sensitive marker for the diagnosis and follow-up of children with Neuroblastoma and appears to be more accurate and less cumbersome than measurement of urinary catecholamines.

From 1978 to 1980, we treated 10 consecutive patients with NLL in remission (REM) with CY-120 and TBI, 800 rad. The TB! was given as a single dose at a rate of 8 rad/min from a 6 Mcv l.inc.\u00b7r Accelerator. Tl1e patients ranged in age from 4 to 18 years. Diagnoses inc 1 uded 6 with acute myelogenous (AMI .. ) or myelomonocyt ic leukemia (AM}!L) in first REM; 2 with AML in second REM; and 1 with acute monocytic (AMoL) and 1 with acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL) in first REM. RESULTS. As of 12/1/81, all 6 children with AMI.. or AMML tran\"SPian\"t--C.d in first REM survive in complete remission (CR) for 21-42 months. One child with AML in 2nd REM survives in CR at 31 months. The other relapsed and died at 15.5 months. The patients with AMol. and AUL relapsed and died 2.5 and 8 months pnst BMT. None developed fatal interstitial pneumonia, conpared with 3/8 other patients who received 1000 rad single dose TBI as part of their cytoreduction. CONCLUSION. Our data suggest that long term CR may be achieved in children with A.ML in first remission by performing BMT with lPss TBI than heretofore deemed possible. The benefit of reduced radiation may be to decrease the incidence of interstitial pneumonia.INVOLVEMENT OF \"OTHER\" COAGULATION FACTORS IN EARLY 719 ONSET NEONATAL SEPSIS. L. Bortol_l!. \u00a7 \u00a7_i, C. __ Stinsql2.!. (Spon. by John F. Crocker). Dalhousie University, Dept. of Pediatrics, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Neonates have unique susceptibility to bacterial septicemia. Hemostasis is influenced by the inflammatory process through complement activation and protease release. Six infants were studied at the time of their clinical diagnosis of infection. Coagulation factors affected by granulocytc proteases (FVIII, FXIII, 111.2 macroglobulin-d.2M, c(lantitrypsin-o<.lAT) and coagulation factors which modify host response to infection (fibronectin-FN, acid l glycoprotein-AG) were measured. FVIII antigen/activity ratios were increased when compared with gestational age matched controls (p(0.005), perhaps related to endothelial release of antigen concurrent with protease destruction of activity. FXIII was unaffected in these septic infants. Low values of 0C.2M were measured (p(0.05). This may reflect the removal ofQ(2M-protease complexes. Levels of (a slow inactivator of proteases) were elevated (p(.0.005) -a response in keeping with an acute phase reactant. FN, an opsonin which enhances reticulo-endothelial clearance and protects against vascular microembolism, was decreased ( p (. O. 005) . Deficiency of FN may delay elimination of bacteria and contribute to pulmonary insufficiency seen in neonatal sepsis. Measurements of the heparin antagonist AG were increased (p ( O. 005) and may be responsible for the heparin resistance found in septicemia. Cryoprecipitate, with its high levels of FN, may have therapeutic benefit in neonates with early onset sepsis.

Fred Saunders, Univ of Toronto, Hosp for Sick Children, Div of Hematology, Toronto, Canada. A unique culture method has been developed which profiles classes of hematopoictic stem cells in 1 culture plate. Marrow or peripheral blood cells were cultured in methylcellulose with 2-mercaptoethanol, erythropoietin, and PHA-LCM. Pluripotent stem cells formed colonies containing granulocytes, erythrocytes, macrophages, and megakaryocytes (CFU-GEMM). The plates also contained colonies of specific cell type from BFU-E, CFU-C and CFU-M. When replaced, single CFU-GEMM gave rise to secondary CFU-GEMM confirming self renewal. Control marrow (n=22) yielded means\u00b1SD of 17\u00b112 CFU-GEMM, 136\u00b177 BFU-E and 145\u00b167 CFU-C/2 x 105 cells plated, 3-4 fold higher than values in peripheral blood. Changes in numbers of CFU-GEMM correlated closely with changes in BFU-E (r=.77) but not with CFU-C. In Fanconi's anemia CFU-GEMM were markedly decreased indicating a defect in the pluripotent stem cell. In aplastic anemia the dynamics of reconstitution of all progenitor classes could be demonstrated after marrow transplantation. In red cell aplasia serum inhibitors specific for BFU-E could be documented. In Diamond-Blackfan anemia both decreased BFU-E and CFU-GEMM were seen suggesting a defect earlier in hematopoiesis than previously suspected. In osteopetrosis there were 10 fold increases in blood CFU-GEMM, BFU-E, and CFU-C. This novel assay gives an overview of the relationship between pluripotent and committed stem cells using procedure and is applicable to studies of hematopoiesis at its earliest stages. TRANSIENT RED CELL APLASIA OF CHILDHOOD: VARIED PATHOGENESIS. Melvin H. Freedman and E. Fred Saunders, Univ of Toronto, Hosp for Sick Children, Div of Hematology, Toronto, Canada. Transient red cell aplasia (\"erythroblastopenia\") is a unique disorder of previously healthy children characterized by profound erythropoietic failure with preservation of other hematopoietic lines, and spontaneous recovery without recurrence. The mechanism of anemia in 4 pts was studied in vitro at the time of diagnosis by assessing BFU-E in methylcellulose cultures. Marrow from pt 1 yielded normal numbers of colonies (13 BFU-E/105 cells plated V8 controls, 18 BFU-E!l0/105) that markedly declined when autologous serum or IgM was added to the cultures ( 4 BFU\u00b7\u00b7E/ 105 a.id 0 BFU-E/105, respectively), but remained unchanged with added autologous lgG or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Pt 2 had 30 BFU-E/105 which were completely abolished on addition of autologous serum or IgG, but were unchanged with TgM or PBMC.Marrow from pt 3 yielded 1 BFU-E/105 with standard plating techniques, but produced 59 BFU-E/105 when plated after fractionating the cells on an albumin density gradient. PBMC from pt 3 suppressed BFU-E growth (from 44 to 20/105) but serum had no effect. Pt 4 had 11 BFU-E/105 that increased with added autologous serum and remained unchanged with autologous PBMC. We conclude that the red eel 1 aplasia in pts 1, 2 & 3 '\u00b7'\u00b7'lS due to suppressed erythropoiesis via IgM, lgG, and cell-mediated inhibition, respectively, and in pt 4 by a non-immune mechanism.

Alpert) We have reported (NEJM 304: 146) that approximately 60% of histiocytosis-X patients will respond to therapy with suppressin (thymic extract), a derivative of calf thymus that induces suppressor T-cells. We studied 4 factors to see whether they could predict patient response: !)clinical stage, 2) #of T-cells with H2 type histamine receptors (H2R+ cells), 3) ratio of T-cells with HI receptors (helper cells) to those with H2 receptors (suppressor cells)(HlR+:H2R+), 4) induction of H2R+ suppressor cells by incubation in suppressin. In this study, 13/20 patients responded to suppressin (65%). The responding patients were from all clinical stages, and stage was not useful as an indicator. The other 3 factors were all significantly predictive of response to suppres\u00b7 sin therapy. These data indicate that those patients who arc characterized by low numbers of H2R+ suppressor cells, a high helper \" value suppressor cells after incuin suppressin, may constitu:e a biologically distinct subset of patients who are immunologically Rbnurmal.

Previous studies have demonstrated the relation of alpha thalassernia and hemoglobin (Hb) Bart's in cord blood. we quantitated Hb Bart's in 158 (125 white, 33 black) random cord blood samples by microchromatography (Isolab, Akron, Ohio). All babies had measurable quantities of Hb Bart's. Normal babies (defined as having a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) > 105) had a 0.91 + 0.3% Hb Bart's. There was no significant difference in the mean Hb Bart's level between white/black babies. The presence of increased Hb Bart's ( > 2 SD) along with low MCV ( < 105) and negative discriminant function (DF) were used for evaluation of alpha thalassemia. The following results were obtained: Hb Bart's> 2 SD Black (n = 10) White (n = 9) Statistical tests failed to show any correlation between increased Hb Bart's, low MCV, and negative OF. It is concluded that while the presence of an increased amount of Hb Bart's accompanied by l\u00b0\" MCV and negative DF may suggest alpha thalassernia, the presence of measurable amountsof Hb Bart's in cord blood is common to all babies. dissolve large amounts of gases.

The FEP le.Nels ranged from 81 to 315 \u00b5g/dl and the blood Pb ranged from 35-54 ig/dl. Microcytosis (> 2SD below mean normal MCV for age) was noted in 35 subjects.

These data suggest that the changes in RBC indices in Pb poisoning more closely resemble the pattern seen in Fe def rather than thalassemia and indicate some degree of ineffective erythropoiesis which causes the RBC count to decline relatively more than the MCV.

We examined red cell deformability by measuring the filtration time (FT} of washed red blood cells through polycarbonate filters. Nineteen children with HIM, 11 with aseptic meningitis and 30 normal subjects were studied. The hemoglobin levels of the HIM patients = 10.B !1.1 gm/dl} were significantly lower than the aseptic meningitis patients (12.7!1.6, p < 0.001) and the 30 normal children p < 0.001). The FTs of the HIM patients were prolonged (76.8!83.3 secs} compared to those with aseptic meningitis (24.4!5.B, p < 0.05) and the normals (24.1!5.3, p < 0.01). carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO%}, an excellent index of red cell destruction, was measured to determine if the anemia was hemolytic in nature. The HbCO% levels in patients with HIM were 1.03!.63% with 64% of patients exhibitingelevated values (>.78%). There was a significant positive correlation between the HIM FTs and the CO (r=0.77, p < 0.01). There was also a positive correlation between the FTs and the absolute band and granulocyte counts. No patients had evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. The elevated HbCO% in patients with HIM supports the hemolytic nature of the anemia associated with this disorder. The correlation of the HbCO% and the FT suggests that the diminished red cell deforrnabi'lity in HIM results in a decreased red cell survival and anemia.",

Preincubation of N-PMNs with antioxidants (Vit E or dihydroxybenzoic acid) enhanced orientation into fMLP (p<.01). To evaluate a possible cytoskeletal basis for these abnormalities, imrnunofluorescent techniques employing sheep antitubulin & anticentriole sera were developed. Results were evaluated in \"double-blind 11 experiments by two observers. Oriented into gradients of fMLP, N PMNs demonstrated 26+6 MTs/cell compared to 33+7 for A PMNs. The average MT length was also diminished in N (8.l\u00b5m) as compared to A (10.5\u00b5m) PMNs.

No differences were observed in yield or viability of cells obtained in control, nonventilated rabbits and 3 & 6 hout ventilated groups. However, ventilation for 6 hours resulted in a profound depression in Fe-rosette and phagocytic activity, as shown below: ventilntcd with room air for 6 hours showed no significant depression of PAM function.

This study investigateswhether circulating serum pigA is transferred to tears. pigA anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) antibody was prepared from the ascitic fluid of mice bearing the MOPC-315 plasmacytoma. The antibody was injected intravenously into lactating (day 1) and non-pregnant, non-lactating adult female Sprague-Dawley rats. Lacrimal secretions were collected 1 hour after injection. pigA was detected by immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-mouse IgA antiserum coated polyacrylamide beads and 125I-DNP10-bovine serum albumin. plgA was detected in tears from lactating but not in tears from non-lactating, non-pregnant animals. These qualitative studies establish that plgA can be transported from serum to tears during lactation. The observation that the MOPC-315 pigA appears in the tears of lactating animals suggests that hormonal changes of lactation enhance the transport of plgA into external secretions.",

GSD lb was documented by liver biopsy and a normal amount of latent glucose-6-phosphatase activity. Patient A, age4, had stomatitis, skin infections and septicemia; patient B, 16, had minor infections and periodontitis. Absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) ranged from 160 to 1200/mm3. Diminished and delayed migration of PMNs into a skin \"window\" occurred in B; ANC increased from 490 to 1260/mm3 after epinephrine stimulation. Random and directed PMN migration under agarose toward f-Met-Leu-Phe (FMLP), pepstatin, and zymosan-activated sera were severely diminished in both patients. At lo-7 FMLP, mean random and directed migration were 52% and 10% (A, n=3) and 48% and 8% (B, n= 4) of controls. These results were independent of incubation time and chemoattractant concentration. Parents' PMN showed normal migration. No cell-directed inhibitors were present in patients' sera, and zymosan activation effected normal control PMN migration. Patients' PMN had diminished quantitative NBT reduction compared to controls. B had a significant defect in bactericidal activity with E. coli with <0.2 log killing at 2 hr.

Generation of polyamine\u00a3 correlated poorly (R2, square of multiple correlation) with blastogenesis of allogeneic MLC polyamine production in syngeneic m.c was as high as in allogeneic llLC.

Department of Pediatrics and Oral Biology, SUNY at Buffalo, Children's Hospital, Buffalo, NY.Amoung the many complications in patients with IDDM, iritis and peridontitis are considered to be rather infrequent and appears to have received less attention. We have evaluated 280 patients with IDDM during past 2 years for their dental condi-tions; gingivitis and periodontitis were noted in 20% of 165 patients aged 12-25 years and in only one of 125 patients aged 2-11 years. Iritis \u2022\u00b7'\"\" observed in 7 of 236 patients (11 years or older) seen during past 7 years (6 of 109 females and 1 of 127 males). None of 198 patients 10 years or younger had irits. Jn patients with iritis, the mean age (year) of diabetes onset was 8.71 (5-11), and the mean duration (year) of diabetes at the time of iritis was 8.43 (5-11). One female patient with iritis had anti-islets cell auto-antibody with titer of more 1:16 7 years after the onset of diabetes. Periodontitis and iritis may be an hitherto unrecognized important complication in certain groups of patients with IDDM. The association of persistant auto-antibody against islets cell and iritis in a patient indicate that the autoimmune mechanism may play a role in the pathogenesis of iritis.

Gelfand) Division of Inununology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario. A number of laboratories have suggested that human T-cell helper function is radioresistant. We have reexamined the radiosensitivity of T-cell helper and suppressor function in the regulation of pokeweed mitogen (PWM) -stimulated human B-cell differentiation in vitro. Increasing numbers of irradiated or nonirradiated T cells (E-rosetting cells) from peripheral blood or tonsil were added to constant numbers of autologous B cells (non-E-rosetting cells), stimulated with PWM, and cultured for days in microtiter plates. Culture supernatants were assayedfor anti-dinitrophenyl and anti-phosphorylcholine antibody production, as well as total IgM and IgG secretion by a solid phase radioimmunoassay. We have demonstrated that peripheral blood T helper function can be radiosensitive. More immunoglobulin and antibody is produced by cultures containing unirradiated T cells, than by cultures with irradiated T cells, but only when the T/B ratio is low (i.e., 1/100 to 1/10). At higher T/B ratios (!/! or greater) irradiated T cells always providesuperior helper cell function. The crossover point at which irradiated T cells become more efficient varies from individual to individual and depends on the radiation dose employed. Thus, care must be taken in the in vitro functional evaluation of disease states reported to be caused by regulatory cell imbalance, since information derived from one combination of T and B cells may give a distorted view.

Sch. of Med., and Dept. of Peds., Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Phila., PA. Breast milk macrophages (BMM) may have an important role in neonatal host defenses; however, the functional capabilities of the BMM have not been sufficiently evaluated. Previous studies have compared phagocytosis and killing of the neutrophil with the BMM. We analyzed the functional activity of the BMM by comparing its phagocytic and bactericidal capacity for E.coli with that of its presumed progenitor, the peripheral blood monocyte. Fresh BM was obtained from mothers 2-4 days postpartum, refrigerated, centrifuged, and washed in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS). Peripheral blood monocytes (PBM), were prepared from Ficoll-Hypaque interface cells by purification on microexudate-coated flasks. BBM and PBM were adhered to glass coverslips (CS) at 3xl05 cells/CS and incubated 1 hr with HBSS/1596 FCS (IOOul) + J.5xJ06 E. coli/CS (JOOul) suspended in HBSS/10% human serum (HS) as opsonin. Phagocytosis was evaluated by counting the number of cells which contained at least 1 bacterium and the number of bacteria/ phagocytic cell. Fewer BMM (46 :!. 5 SEM) than PBM (74 :!. JO) ingested E. coli (p < .05); however, when ingestion occurred the number of bacteria/cell was similar (BMM = 2.6 :!. .31, PBM = 2.1 :!. .23). Percent killing, expressed as killed bacteria/total ingested bacteria was significantly greater by PBM (BMM = 60 :!. 2, PBM = 81 :!. 3, p <..0001) with HS as an opsonin. BM 00-10096) was not an effective opsonin with either cell in this system although ingested organsims were killed. Thus, under defined in vitro conditions, the BMM has bactericidal capacity within 2096 of the PBM. A STUDY OF SPECIFIC IN VITRO ANTIBODY RESPONSES \u2022 926 USING HUMAN CORD BLOOD LYMPHOCYTES (CBL).

Both infants had perianal abscesses and responded with leukemoid reactions (WBC 70, 000) . One infant was the product of a consanguineous relationship; neither had family history of recurrent infections. Both infants had normal immunoglobulins and complement levels, and one infant had moderately depressed lymphocytic proliferation to mitogens. These infants showed a marked delay in polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) chemilwninescence (CL) response to opsonized zymosan and one had a depressed PMN CL response, as well. Monocyte (MNC) CL to opsonized zymosan was depressed and delayed in each infant. In contrast, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), a soluble stimulator, elicited normal PMN and MNC CL responses in each infant. PMN phagocytosis of E. coli was severely depressed in both infants as was their bactericidal capacity for this organism.",

CONTROL: born of nonimmune control mothers (NIM); (2) IMMUNE: born of fully influenza A (H3N2) immune mothers (I+AbM); and (3) BOTH: born of H3N2 immune mothers in whom influenza specific serum antibody was suppressed by passive antibody received one day prior to non-lethal influenza infection (I-AbM). In addition, two other groups of inf ant mice were cross-fostered to determine the route of transmission of NAHI: (4) BREAST: infants of NIM suckled on I-AbM; (5) PLACENTA: infants of I-AbM suckled on NIM.

Our report describes a 1400 gram black male, born at 32 weeks gestation to a 22 yo G2Pl with hemoglobin S-C and non-A, non-B chronic active hepatitis. The infant presented with respiratory distress minutes after C section and had marked icterus and hepatomegaly. The maternal and infant hilirubin values are shown below, along with liver functions. was ventilated, cultured, and begun on antibiotics. Two double exchanges were performed for rising indirect bilirubin. The infant died at 24 hours of life from respiratory complications and arrhythmias. Autopsy findings included mild adrenal and gastric hemorrhages. The liver demonstrated mu 1 t inuc leated giant cells, i.ntercel lular, intercanalicular and interductal cho1estasis. The brain showed no kernictcrus.The data suggest a second case of human placental passage or indirect bilirubin without kernicterus. Direct hilirubin has not been shown to cross the placenta in previous studies, and these findings may be due to the neonatal hepatitis, however, the high direct fraction and the similarity with the maternal value sugr.est the possibility of transplacental transfer of direct hilirubin.",

Ellen 0. Fuller, Joseph W. Starnes, Dennis I. Goldberg, Linda M. Sacks and Maria Delivoria-Papadopoulos. Univ. of PA. School of Med., Depts. of Physiology and Pediatrics, Phila., PA.Heart mitochondria of newborn and adult animals subjected invivo to hypoxia show increased state 3 respiratory activity. To determine whether an increase occurs in the absence of factors extrinsic to the tissue, studies in isolated perfused hearts were conducted. 31 excised rat hearts were pei\u00b7fused by retrograde, single-pass perfusion through the aorta with Krebs Henseleit buffer and 8 mM glucose at P0 2 =631\u00b114 mmHg (control) or P0 2 =!55\u00b111 mmllg (hypoxia). 28 hearts were perfused for 20 min each; control hearts (N=8) with high P02 perfusate only, while the remainder were switched to low P0 2 perfusate for the last min (N=2), 5 min (N=8) or IO min (N=9) of perfusion. Three more hearts were perfused for 25 min using high P0 2 perfusate for IO min, then low P02 perfusate for 15 min. Mitochondria were then isolated and state 3, state 4 respiratory rate and ADP/0 determined. Spontaneously beating, non-ejecting hearts responded to hypoxia by 27%decreased heart 29% increased coronary flow after IO min. Hypoxia did not alter state 4, ADP/O, or the yield of isolated mitochondrial protein. However, state 3 respiration (natoms Oz min-' mg-1 mitochondrial protein) increased from control values of 306\u00b1 pH was normal during MH and slightly decreased from control during SH. Aortic pressure(AoP), ECG and phasic mesenteric(Mcs), femoral(Fem), carotid(Car) and renal(Ren) blood flows were recorded; means and resistances(R) were calculated.

A 14 mm maxinrum diameter polyethylene angioplasty catheter (Medi-Tech, Inc.) was positioned in the pulmonary artery (PA) at the level of the valve, The balloon was hand inflated for 10 sec and then rapidly deflated. During the balloon inflation there was a transient rise in right ventricular pressure (RVP)(to 90 ITll!llg) and a drop in femoral artery pressure (FAP) (to 24/20 ITll!llg). Right ventricular cineangiography after the balloon valvuloplasty demonstrated widening of the pulmonary During the time the balloon was inflated, the electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated a mild sinus bradycardia with occasional ectopic atrial beats and occasional PVC's. Interval ECG's have shown regression in right ventricular hypertrophy, If the reduction in RVP is sustained and additional patients successfully treated, balloon valvuloplasty may become an effective alternative to open heart surgery for congenital pulmonary valvular stenosis.

Arcilla; The University of Chicago Hospitals and Clinics, Departments of Pediatrics and Surgery, Chicago, Illinois Abnormal function of sinus node (SN) or of A-V node (AVN) afteropen-heart repair of secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) is often ascribed to surgical injury. To check if SN-AVN dysfunction is a pre-surgical or post-surgical abnormality, we conducted electrophysiologic studies (EPS) on 31 children with isolated ASD, age 0.6 to 16 years, before surgery (Gp A), and on 11 children after surgery (Gp B). EPS were obtained using multipolar electrode catheters, and analyzed with H-P digitizer/computer for: A-H and H-V intervals, sinus node recovery time, sinoatrial conduction time, and effective/functional refractory periods. RV and LV volumes, ejection fractions and outputs were derived from angiograms. SN-AVN dysfunction was observed in 42% in Gp A, and in 54% in Gp B. Resting A-H and H-V intervals were normal. Patients in Gp A with NORMAL (NI) or ABNORMAL (Abl) SN-AVN had comparable hemodynamics (mean, NI vs Abl): RA pressure (5.4, 6.4), RV systolic (37,.34), PA mean(18, 19), Qp/Qs (2.2, 2.1), RVEDV (159, 143 % PN), LVEDV (86, 86 % PN), and angio RV/LV output ratio",

Progression in the degree of right ventricular outflow obstruction from AMB has been reported. Cyanosis from right-to-left ventricular level shunting has been described as a complication of late childhood or adolescence.This report concerns two infants who developed rapidly progressive hypertrophy of AMB and presented with severe cyanotic spells in infancy. Both underwent successful repair of their defects. The clinician should be alerted that AMB may hypertrophy very rapidly, necessitating surgical intervention in the first year of life.CARDIAC DYSRHYTHMIA AFTER THE SENNING PROCEDURE FOR 1)-147 TRANSPOSITION OF THE GRF.AT ARTERIES. Thomas C. Martin, Antonio Hernandez, Clarence S. Weldon,A'ie'rls-F . ---Hartmann, Jr., Arnold Strauss, Washington Univ. School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of cardiac dysrhythmia developing after the Senning procedure as compared with that following the Mustard repair. F.ighteen patients, 3 to 14 months of age were corrected by the Senning procedure and 16 patients 7 mos to yrs of age had the Mustard procedure. Both surgical procedures were carried out under deep hypothermia. The preoperative ECG of all patients showed normal sinus rhythm (NSR). These results suggest that the Senning repair one year postoperatively may be less arrhythmogenic than the Mustard procedure, but long-term followup is needed for positive confirmation of the above findings.CARDIAC ABNORMALITIES IN HYPERTENSIVE CHILDREN.Western Reserve University, Cleveland Metropolitan General Hosp-ital, Department of Pediatrics and Cardiology, Cleve., Oh.Documentation of tachycardia in children with mild hyperten-sion (HTN) is generally based on brief periods of observation andhas been attributed to anxiety. In order to confirm this observation, heart rates throughout the 24 hour period were measured prospectively in ten ambulatory mildly hypertensive children.Toevaluate the presence of anatomical abnormalities -M-mode echocardiograms were done in eight patients and normal matched controls. A significant increase in left ventricular posterior wall thickness (cm.) (1.01 :!: 0.13 vs 0.825 :!: .14; p= < .02) during diastole; interventricular septum thickness during diastole (l.07 \u00b1 0.2 vs .81 \u00b1 0.13; p= < .01) and systole (1.4 \u00b1 0.2 vs 1.17 :!: 0.15; p= <. 05) was observed.

To sbJdy this problem M-mode Echo and cardiac cath. were performed in 38 :hildren with VSD. Pts. were divided into 3 groups:A) 14 pts. c RV or PA systolic pressures (RVSP,PASP)<SO mm Hg, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR)(3 U/M 2 :B) 14 pts. c RVSP or PASP>SO mm Hg,PVR(3 U/M2:C) 10 pts. c RVSP or PASP>SO mm Hg, PVR>3 U/M 2 . 27 normal pts. had only Echo. Results:Groups B and C behave similarly,but all can be separated from A by ICT and ICT/RVET. The best correlation coefficients for PASP were: RICT/RVETc,r=.824,ICT,r=.800. In summary,although a comprehensive evaluation of RVSTI (including RICT,RICT/RVETc) can not separate VSD pts. c high and low PVR,is accurate enough in predicting PAH and therefore in helping to indicate cardiac catheterization in pts. with VSD.

Fernbach, Northwestern University School of Medicine, Children's Memorial Hospital, Departments of Pediatrics and Radiology, Chicago. Seventeen infants and children, suspected clinically of having obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), underwent echocardiography (ECHO) examination in both the awake and asleep state to monitor the cardiovascular effects of the exaggerated respiratory variation in intrathoracic pressure. The diagnosis of OSA was established by upper airway fluoroscopy and monotoring during sleep with corroboration by transcutaneous P02 and end-tidal PC02 determinations in 12 patients, while 5 patients were normal. During inspiration the RV dimensions were markedly increased, the LV dimensions were decreased and the ventricular systolic time intervals changed in a manner that is consistent with decreasing RV afterload and increasing LV afterload. The converse changes occurred during expiration. Four patients had abnormal ECHO results while both awake and asleep, S patients had abnormal ECHO studies only during sleep and the remaining 3 had normal ECHO studies both awake and asleep, while only 4 of these 12 patients had an abnormal EKG.

Elevated levels of erythropoietin and increased erytl1ro1>oiesis have been reported in the cord blood from infants of diabetic mothers. It has also been shown by others that de nova synthesis of HbF is enhanced by erythropoietin when human erythroid stem cells from adults with no HbF are grown in clonal cultures. To determine whether the reported conditions of the increased erythropoietin in fetus of the diabetic mother can effect the proportion of HbA and HbF synthesis, studies were carried out on cord blood obtained from term newborn infants of insulin dependant diabetic mothers. Cord blood samples from infants of rated the radioactive HbA and HbF. Globin chain separations were carried out on some samples using carboxylmethylcellulose chromatography in order to determine if the HbF separated was contaminated by a significant amount of Hblc. The data obtained to date showed that these newborns are synthesizing significantly more HbF than would be expected for their period of human development (n=6, = 8Z.O ! 5.57. vs 67.5 \u00b1 9.9%). It is thus conceivable that the levels of erytl1ropoietin plus other unknown factors in the fetus of the diabetic mother stimulate erythroid precursor cells than contain HbF.

CHARACTERIZATION OF BETA ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS IN \u2022 18(} FETAL RABBIT BROWN ADIPOCYTES. Paula J. Chou, Anita 1. Reviczky, and Alan H. Klein. UCLA School of Medicine, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Department of Pediatrics, Torrance, CADuring a cold stress, brown adipose tissue (BAT) respiration is increased in response to neurosympathetic stimulation. [ 3 H] dihydroalprenolol, a potent beta adrenergic antagonist, was used to identify and characterize beta adrenergic binding sites on fetal rabbit brown adipocyte membrane preparations. 11 litters of 31 day gestation rabbit fetuses were obtained by hysterotomy. After decapitation, BAT was removed from the paracervical and interscapular regions. Tissue from fetuses in 1-2 litters was pooled for membrane preparation. Adipocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion, then homogenized and fractionated to yield the plasma membrane fractions. Binding of [ 3 H] dihydroalprenolol was rapid, reaching saturable equilibrium within 10 minutes. Binding was linear between 70 and 280 mcg membrane protein per tube. Scatchard analyses with high degree of linearity (r=.954) indicate that DHA binds to a single class of receptors. The dissociation constant and maximal binding (mean \u00b1 SEM) were 1.71\u00b10.21 nM and 119\u00b114 fmole/mg protein. B adrenergic agonists competed for DHA binding sites with potency characteristic of Bl adrenergic receptors: (-)isoproterenol > (-)norepinephrine (-)epinephrine. Binding was stereospecific, (-)propranolol Tnhibition being 100 fold more potent than (+)propranolol. Conclusion: Brown adipocytes from term fetal rabbits demonstrate high affinity, low capacity, readily saturable, stereoselective Bl catecholamine receptors.HEPARIN INHIBITS THE PROLIFERATION OF FETAL PUL'!ONARY \u2022 187 ARTERY SMOOTH MUSCLE CELLS VITRO.

SEM) and dosages are shown: T3 markedly increases EGF in newborn mouse skin; 2) Dex produces a small but significant (p<.01) increase in skin EGF but no additive effect with T3; 3) T3 and/or Dex reduce body weight; 4) T3 + Dex markedly accelerates incisor eruption. Speculation: Epidermal maturation induced by T3 t Dex may be mediated by local levels of EGF. Dept. Hum. Devel. Nutr., NYS Inst. Basic Res. Devel.Disab., Staten Island, N.Y. 10314.",

Soucek, Jr.;Vanderbilt University, Dept. of Pediatrics, Nashville,TN The current concept of shock produced by acute Fe poisoning proposes an Fe-induced venous dilation with decreased ventricular filling and a decline in cardiac output. However, Fe may also be cardiotoxic. Thus, we examined the effects of Fe on MC in isolated rabbit papillary muscles(PM; n=ll)and left atrial strips(LA; n=8). The table below shows values (X + SEM)for peak developed tension (DT;grams), maximum rate of tension developmcnt(dT/dt;grams/sec) and time to peak tension(msec) at various concentrations of Fe. Resting tension and the duration of contraction were not affected by Fe. However, Fe produced a dose-related depression of MC as evidenced by decreased OT and dT/dt. This effect was not reversible by washing the Fe from the bath. The direct depressant effect of Fe on MC may significantly contribute to the genesis of shock in acute Fe poisoning. Our findings suggest that further studies may be indicated to evaluate the of inotropic agents in severe Fe poisoning. PHARMACOKINETICS OF CHLORAMPHENICOL IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS. W. Banner, K.

It has been postulated that th.e improved survival and long term outcomeofVLBW(<l.5Kg) infants in the early and mid 1970's are the result of neonatal intensive care. Alarmingly, since 1978 we have noted an increased incidence of cerebral palsy (spastic diplegia, quadruplegia) in infants followed to at least 20 months (60%transport 40% inborn). In order to elucidate this problem we compared the outcome of 205 infants (BW 1. 2Kg, GA 29. 9 wks) born in 1976 and 1977 who survived until discharge with 232 infants (BW l.2Kg, GA29.8wks) born in 1978and 1979. Survival in 1976-77 was 71%(205/289) and in 1978-79 66%(232/354) N.S.There were no differences between the two periods in BW, GA or Hobel antepartum, intrapartum and neonatal risk scores.

Varicel la may be severe or fatal in adults, and hospi ta! staff with varicella may spread disease to their patients. Numbers of susceptibles may vary in different locales. At NYU the incidence of varicella in pediatric residents was 1 every other year from 1973-78 (1%). In 1980 4 pediatric residents (8%) contracted varicella at Downstate. Serologic testing for antibody (Ab) to varicella-zostcr (VZ) virus by indirect immunofluorescence (FAMA) is now widely available. Most adults with no history are immune; in 1981, only 5% of Downstate residents with no history had a VZ-FAMA of <:: 1 :2. Varicel la vaccine, developed by Takahashi in 1974, has been used mainly in children. we have immunized 19 susceptible adults, mostly medical personnel. All developed VZ-Ab and CMI, with no significant side effects. The VZ-FAMA geometric mean titer at 6 mo (11 pts) and l yr (10 pts) was 1 :10. No cases of clinical varicella have occurred, despite 4 close exposures to patients. Varicella vaccine may prove useful to prevent clinical varicella in susceptible hospital staff.

Accordingly, we compared results of esophaqoscopics and biopsies in 114 patients, ages 8 mos to 18 yrs (mean, 12 yrs, 61 males and 53 females) evaluated for acid reflux. Endoscopic diagnosis of esophaqitis depended upon presence of erythema, granularity, friability, ulceration, pallor, edema or plaques. Esophagitis on biopsy was defined as presence of either intraepithelial eosinophils/neutrophils or basal zone hyperplasia. patients with biopsy-proven esophaqitis, 43 had endoscopic abnormalities 86%, p = 0.03).

Mary Ellen A. Bozynski (Sponsored by Joseph R.

McCann, University of Michigan, School of Medicine, Wayne County General Hospital, Department of Pediatrics and Medicine. Wayne, Michigan. Vitamin E may be important in the prevention of hemolytic anemia and amelioration of retrolental fibroplasia and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in the premature. Prematures are thought to be relatively Vitamin E deficient. They often receive parenteral nutrition for prolonged periods. Vitamins during parenteral nutrition are often administered using multi-vitamin infusion (MVIR) containing tocopherol acetate as the Vitamin E supplement. Fat soluble vitamins may absorb to glass and intravenous administration sets. This has been reported for Vitamin A. Parenteral alimentation fluid was prepared for a theoretical l/kg. neonate containing 1 cc MVIR (1 mgm Vitamin E acetate). The solution was run through an intravenous administration set. Aliquots were collected at t=O, 2, 4, 6 and 24 hours and Vitamin E was measured by high performance liquid chromatography. This was repeated under conditions similating exposure of the system during phototherapy. Recovery from the multi-vitamin preparation was 60%. There was no loss from initial concentration over time. Passage tht\u00b7ough the administration set and phototherapy did not result in any change in recovery. Vitamin E appears to be stable in solution and avail able to the neonate under usual clinical conditions.

The infants were gaining weight (15.2g/k9.d), length (0.98cm/wk) & bead circ (0. 76cm/wk) at approximately intrauterine growth rates. The infants received 172 \u00b1 4ml/kg.d of OMM containing 64.8 \u00b1 7kcal/dl. The energy cost of wt gain was 3.66kcal/g comprising 3.09kcal/ g as stored energy & 0.57kcal/g as the energy cost of tissue synthesis. The accretion rates of protein & fat & proportional composition of the daily wt gain(fat 16.6%; protein 13.4%)were comparable to those reported for the 3rd trimester fetusl, suggesting that 172ml/kg.d of OMM provided a source of energy & macronutrients sufficient to promote growth in the preterm infant of similar quality to that of the fetus. 1)Widdowson E, Scien Fdn Peds, Heineman, Lond, 1974, p.44  & 153.

Rats maintained on a synthetic low starch diet (5 cal%) when placed on a high starch diet (70 cal%) show rapid increase in activity levels of the intestinal disaccharidases, sucraseisomaltase, maltase and lactase as a group (Yamada et al, BiochimBiophys Acta 676:108, 1981). Examination of mechanism's leading to these activity increased revealed synthesis rates of the glucosidases S/I and maltase to be increased 10-11 times as an accompanying event. On the other hand, similar changes in synthesis of lactase were not evident. Relative disaccharidase syn-thesis rates were determined by comparinp, incorporation rates of [3H]-leucine, following isolation of each in high radiochemical purity by selective immunoprecipitation technique. These studies demonstrate dietary carbohydrate to be a determinant of a-glucosidase synthesis. Since S/I and maltase contain about 30% and 20% structural carbohydrate, respectively, (Tsuboi et al, J Memb Biol 50:101, 1979) it is proposed that their synthesis rates may be limited by the amount of carbohydrate ingested.

To determine the influence of intrauterine growth retardation(IUGR)on CMI in the uninfected fetus we measured lymphocyte proliferation in response to a panel of 4 mitogens in 90 appropriately grown(AGA)and 20 growth retarded(SGA)neonates. Proliferation/105 cord blood mononuclear cells was measured with a whole blood assay using tritiated thymidine incorporation. Neonatal lymphocyte proliferation did not differ with gestational age, was unrelated to intrauterine growth (nutritional) status, and differed from adult lymphocyte responses only in response to PHA. In contrast to other observations data demonstrate no effect of IUGR on fetal CMI development. This difference may be related to the use of a whole blood lymphocyte culture technique, use of a noninfected patient population, and/or a broader spectrum of mitogens.CHRONIC NONSPECIFIC DIARRHEA, OR THE \"IRRITABLE BOWEL\" IN CHILDHOOD: A NEW LOOK THROUGH THE SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE.

Marc Yudkoff, Itzhak Nissim, Gilberto Pereira and Stanton Segal. Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Department of Pediatrics, Phil a., PA. Disagreement exists in the literature regarding rates of protein synthesis in premature infants. To determine whether these discrepancies might be referable to the use of urinary [ISN]urea or flSN]ammonia as the basis for calculation of protein turnover, we measured this parameter in premature infants with a stochastic model predicated upon excretion of [15N]urea or [15N]ammonia over a 24 hour period following a single intravenous p11lse of [15N]glycine (5 mg/kg). Results for nitrogeo flux, protein synthesis and protein catabolism were 36.4 ! 14.l vs. 56.5 ! 16.4 mgN/kg/hr, 32.8 ! 14.5 vs. 52.5 vs. 17.5 g/kg/d and 21.3 19 vs. 39.3 ! 20.3 g/kg/d for the ammonia-based and models, respectively. The urea-based results agree closely with studies involving a continuous 72 hour [15N]glycine infusion. The lower values for protein synthesis with the 15NH3 model suggest that premature infants preferentially utilize glycine nitrogen for renal ammoniagenesis, as has been suggested for the human adult.",

Goldmann (Spon. by Kenneth Mcintosh), Harvard Medical School, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Dept. of Medicine, Boston. We have discovered pili on isolates of H. influenzae and found that strains possessing these filamentous Surface antigens strongly to isolated human pharyngeal cells. In vitro adherence assays were conducted using a pair of H. influerlzae type B isolates cultured from the CSF and pharynx of the same patient. Both isolates were found to possess the same outer membrane proteins but the pharyngeal isolate strongly hemagglutinated (HA) human O RBCs whereas the CSF isolate did not. Electronmicroscopy (EM) revealed the presence of pili only on the surface of the ph2ryngeal isolate. Representative values for the adherence of these strains to isolated human pharyngeal cells are presented below. strongly HA nontypable isolate also adhered well to pharyngeal cells (mean adherent bacteria/epithelial cell 169:95). We have examined additional clinical isolates to determine the prevalence of pili. Under routine culture conditions the proportion of cells in the piliated phase was below the limits of detection by HA or EM, but piliated subpopulations were isolated from 9 of 11 strains tested by selective absorption to human O RBCs. These results suggest that most, if not all strains of H. influenzae are capable of expressing pili which be important in colonization and infection.

Walter T.St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases, emphis.l'neumocystis carinii pneumonitis occurs almost exclusively in the immunocompromiscd hose while the organism is believed co be prevalent as a latent infection in the immunocompetent human and lower animals. The latency can be unmasked in the rat model by broad-spectrum suppression of the immune responses with corticosteroid administration. A fungal metabolite, cyclosporin A, has recently been discovered to selectively inhibit subsets of T lymphocytes. This compound was used as a probe to learn whether or not sclcccivc T cell inhibition would permit activation of /l. carinii infection. the rat model I'. carinii infection was provoked in I 0 per cent of animals receiving 5.0 mg/kg./day of cyclosporin A and in 50 per cent of those receiving 20.0 mg/kg./day of the drug, while the organism was not detected in untreated concrol animals. More extensive immunosupprcssion with dcxamethasone evoked the pncumonitis in all of the animals so treated. These findings indicate that the T lymphocyte has an active role in the control of I>. carinii infection. Reasonable speculation leads to the expectation that clinical usage of cyclosporin A may be associated with I'. carinii pneumonitis, but to a lesser extent than with corticosteroid therapy.:THE EFFECT OF IMMUNE SERUM AND POLYMYXIN B ON 985 ESCHERICHIA COLI INDUCED INFLAMMATION AND VASCULAR ..... ___ ,jINJURY.

Murata, University of Hawaii School of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Honolulu, Hawaii. Bullae and vesicles are commonly found in lesions in streptococcal cellulitis and erysipelas. We have discovered a protein exotoxin, epidermolytic toxin (Strep ET) elaborated by strains of Streptococcus causing erysipelas. Strep ET was sequentially purified from Todd Hewitt broth culture filtrates by 80% saturated (NH4)?S04 precipitation, Ultrogel AcA 54 chromatography and isoelectric focussing. The resulting preparation migrates as a single band in SOS gel electrophoresis with an estimated molecular weight of 30,000 daltons. Analytical isoelectric focussing reveals the major pl to be at pH 8.8 with three closely associated minor bands. Strep ET is not hemolytic and chemically different from known extracellular streptococcal products. Both live toxigenic streptococci and purified Strep ET cause blister formation after subcutaneous injection in newborn mice. Histologically Strep ET causes separation of cells of the epidermis similar to that caused by staphylococcal epidermolytic toxin. Strep ET was found in 84% of 50 group A beta hemolytic streptococcal throat isolates, 92% of 30 skin isolates and all of 8 cellulitis isolates tested. It can be detected in the bulla fluid of patients with streptococcal cellulitis and erysipelas. Strep ET, produced locally at the infectious site, appears to be responsible for bulla formation in these patients as skin biopsy shows cleavage plane identical to the mouse model. At present unlike Staph ET, Strep ET is not known to cause any generalized toxemic disease.

Of the 122 charts reviewed, there were 76 cases of bacterial meningitis (BM). The remaining 46 cases (38%) had cerebrospinal fluid(CSr); 6 of these had received antibiotics before the CSF was obtained. Eleven infants with BM (14%) had an external communication with the CSF (10) or an inununo-deficiency(1). The bacterial etiology of the remaining 65 patients is shown below. coli and GBS accounted for 83% of the cases of BM < 4 wk. of age. Only 1 case of enteric meningitis occurred at > 4 wk. This infant had been born prematurely and contracted his meningitis while still in the intensive care nursery. H, s, or M accounted for all other cases of BM in infants > 4 wk. of age.

Jacobs, R. Ramamurthy, T.F. Yeh, D. Raval and P. Amma.

IM within 60 min. of birth) or C (control, no early Rx). An initial blood culture (lB) was taken from a peripheral vein in all 1187 infants within 60 min. of repeat blood cultures (RB) were taken when indicated. EOGBS disease was diagnosed if the infant was symptomatic and if the I.B. or R.B. culture (_::.5 days) was positive.Inf. Rate P 17/1000 L.B. n.s. 23/1000 L.B. n.s.

Hospital course was classified as mild (Mi) moderate (Mo) or severe (S). Comparisons of admission geometric mean CSF PRP concentrations (Mi 40, Mo 329, S 304 ng/ml) revealed differences of borderline significance (Mi vs S, p=.04) as did urinary PRP concentrations (Mi vs S, p=.04). Admission blood PRP concentration (Mi 20, Mo 43, S 86) did not significantly differ. However, comparisons of highest observed or \"peak\" blood concentrations which in 25% occurred after admission (Mi 26 Mo 74, S 170) revealed significant differences (Mi vs S, p=.009). All 8 patients with highest observed blood concentrations <1.0 ng/ml had Mi or Mo courses. The duration of antigenemia in days (Mi 13, Mo 13, S 17) did not differ significantly. However, duration of antigenuria increased with severity of disease (Mi 12, Mo 13, S 20) (Mi vs S, p=.003) and best correlated with clinical course. Moreover, all 6 patients with days of antigenuria had Mi or Mo courses while all 6 with days of antigenuria had S courses. Intermediate duration of antigenuria was without prognostic significance. We conclude that low peak blood concentration, antigenuria of short duration and antigenuria of prolonged duration are correlated with severity of hospital course. PREVENTION OF H.

Our protocol involved noninvasive awake and asleep evaluation of upper airway structure and function by fluoroscopy, airflow, impedance pneumography, ECG, respiratory gas exchange, and echocardiography.Three of four of the children demonstrated pathological sleep apnea associated with abnormalities in respiratory gas exchange and cardiac dynamics. Treatment reversed most of the functional abnormalities and consisted of body posturing, tonsilloadenoidectomy and temporomandibular joint release and tracheostomy in one patient. All children with TCS should be evaluated for airway function and sleep apnea and early aggressive therapy instituted to improve the quality of life.

The assay is a m:xiification of the indirect hem.agglutination assay (IHA) and is capable of detecting 103 TCID50 of virus in tissue culture fluid. In the perfonnance of the assay, sheep red blood cells are tanned and sensitized with cannercial CMV -CF antigen at dilutions detennined by checkerboard titration. A lot of carmercial CMV antisera having an IHA titer oi: 1:1024 or higher is chosen. The inhibition assay is perfonnecl by incubation of equal volunes of tissue culture fluid to be tested with the dilutions of the antisera of known strength for 15 minutes at roan A 1:100 dilution of the Cl1V-CF antigen and PBS buffer serve as positive and negative controls respectively. These incubated solutions are then assayed for antibody activity by IHA. A two fold or greater shift to lower titer as canpared with the antigen negative control is considered to be a positive test for the presence of viral antigen. The test is rpecific in that colsely related viruses such as herpes si.l'lplex do not interfere with the assay. Titls IIII assay technique may serve as a tool for screening and identification of tissue culture specimens. It also has potential for use in the direct detection of viral antir;en in clinical spec:i.rrens. BACTEC radiometric systems are used by many laboratories to process blood cultures (BC). In the hypertonic aerobic bottle of this system, pneumo will frequently produce a positive growth index (GI), chocolatize the contents and be visible on Gram stain; but will not grow on subculture. The organism is often, but not always, recoverable by subculture from the paired anaerobic BC. During 1978-80, 23% of patients with pneumo bacteremia at LSUMC had negative subcultures from aerobic BC's with positive GI's. In 1981 we performed CIE on aliquots from GI positive, chocolatized aerobic BC with Gram positive organisms on smear. A Hyland power pack was used. Pneul'!o antibody (Omniserum) was obtained from the Statens Seruminstitut, Copenhagen. Of 42 episodes of pneumo bacteremia, CIE was positive in all 9 of the cases in which the aerobic BC had a positive GI but failed to grow on subculture. In 7 of these patients, subcul- Clostridium difficile has been implicated as one cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea in children, yet the prevalence of this organism in outpatient children with diarrhea has not been estab-1 ished. We therefore prospectively studied 306 pediatric outpatients over a 12 month period. Children presenting with diarrhea and controls with non-diarrheal illnesses were cultured for C. difficile an(I potential bacterial pathogens. C. difficile isolates were identified on a selective medium and confirmed with gas chromatography. Toxin production was detected by counter-iTIITiunoelectrophoresis (CIE).Children ranged in age from 2 weeks to 16 years (median 11 mos). Bacterial pathogens were found in 10.5% of patients with diarrhea (18/171): 12 Salmonella spp., 5 Campylobacter jejuni, and l Shigel!2_ Grp. B. f. difficile was found in 7.0% of patients with diarrhea (12/171) and 14.8% of controls (20/135). Mean age of the 12 diarrhea patients with C. difficile was 9.8 \u00b1 8.6 mos. vs. 8.2 \u00b1 4.9 mos. for the 20 positive controls (N.S.).Antibiotic exposure during the previous month was found in only 22% of all C. difficile-positive patients (7/32). These 32 patients with C. difficile were clinically indistinguishable from the other study patients. All strains of C. difficile were capable of producing toxin as demonstrated-by CJE. C. difficile appears to comprise part of the normal bowel flora in some children despite a negative history of recent antibiotic usage. Disseminated HSV infection occurs more frequently in neonates than adults. To investigate the permissiveness of mononuclear cells for HSY replication, cord and adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated into monocyte and lymphocyte enriched fractions by Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation and adherence to plastic or fibronectin. Cells were then infected with HSV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, washed and serially assayed for HSY using a microtiter method. Mean HSV-2 titers expressed as log10 TCIDSO were:Day A 72 hour incubation time prior to addition of virus or varying the MOI from .001 to l did not alter these findings. HSV-2 did not replicate in freeze-thawed cells including the nonadherent cord blood fraction. The data indicate that nonadherent cord blood mononuclear cells are permissive for HSY infection. This observation may partially explain the higher During a province-wide outbreak of ..!:!\u00b7 monocytoeenes infection, 25 stillborn or live neonates with systemic infection were identified compared to only 7 nonpregnant adults.

To test this hypothesis, we assessed (i) hemolytic complement by the classical (CCP) and alternative (ACP) pathways (ii) fibronectin (FNC, a nonspecific opsonin) and (iii) opsonization 0f listeria using a chemiluminescence assay (CL) on samples of blood obtained from 5 control and 5 infected infants during acute illness.

Pritzker Sch. of Med., Univ. of Chicago, Dept. of Pediatrics, Michael Reese Hosp., Chicago.Passive immunization of the fetus by maternal vaccination has been proposed as a means of immunoprophylaxis for neonatal GBS infection. Since attack rates of early-onset infection are increased in premature infants, the kinetics of transplacental antibody passage are critical to the success of such an approach. We measured levels of naturally occurring type-specific IgG antibody against GBS-Ia in paired cord and maternal serum specimens at gestational ages 22 and 41 weeks. A quantitative ELISA technique sensitive to concentrations of specific antibody ug/ml was used. Twenty-one of 130 maternal sera had IgG anti-GBS la concentrations \"?0.25 ug/ml. Ratios of cord:maternal IgG anti-GBS la ranged from 0.11 to 1.01. Ratios ?.0.25 were found in 6 of 6 serum pairs at gestational ages ?.36 weeks, 11 of 11 at 30 to 35 weeks, and 2 of 5 (including one pair of twins) at gestational ages <30 weeks. Although antibody against GBS-Ia was not prevalent among the mothers tested, these data suggest that transplacental passage can provide protective levels of JgG anti-GBS Ia to premature as well as full-term newborns born to immune mothers. In an experimental model, antibody levels of 1.5 ug/ml uniformly protect against lethal GBS-Ia infection. Therefore, women with 960 UNSUSPECTED MENINGOCOCCAL BACTEREMIA (UMB).

Boston University School of Medicine, Boston City Hospital (BCH), Department of Pediatrics, Boston.To determine the incidence and clinical course of UMB in children we reviewed charts of all 21 children at BCH with meningococcemia from Sept. 1971 to Dec. 1981 . Of these, 13 (mean age 18 mo., range 2-70 mo.) were initially treated parenterally for sepsis (6), meningitis (4) , pneumonia (2), and arthritis (1) . Ten (mean age= 10.5 mo., range= 5-20 mo.) were considered well enough to be sent home.Eight of these 10 received oral antibiotics for otitis media (6) or pneumonia (2). At recall, of these 8, I with a previously normal lumbar puncture (LP) and without prior LP had menil\"'!gitis, 4 were afebrile and without focus of infection, and 2 were still febrile with the same focus. Six were hospitalized and treated parenterally; 2 were continued on oral therapy as outpatients. All 8 recovered without further complications. At first visit, 2 without focal infection were not treated. On recall, 1 was treated orally for otitis media; 1 was treated parenterally for meningococcemia. Both recovered uneventfully.Meningococcemia has been considered an ominous event. These show that UMB occurred in mildly to moderately ill children of Pediatrics, Tulane University, New LA. Genes that code for ampicillin resistance in Hib are carried on extrachromosomal plasmids in 10/37 (27%) of strains. To assess the possibility that R+, ampR strains of Hib are at a selective disadvantage relative to genetically related amp 5 strains, we used the infant rat model to study infection in 277 pups inoculated with one of four strai.1s. Strains studied included Eagan (R-, amps) , A/Eagan (R+, ampR) -a laboratory derived transconjugant containing plasmid DNA encoding for ampR, C306(R+, ampR)a clinical isolate and C306(R-, amps)-a blood isolate from an animal inoculated with C306(R+, ampR). Major outer membrane proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide *el electrophoresis and were identical between pair strains. R and R-strains readily colonized the nasopharynx. The incidence of bacteremia was greater in R-inoculated animals but this difference was not significant. However, the geometric mean number of bacteria in blood was significantly (p<.05) less in R+ inoculated animals as was the incidence of meningitis (p<.03). B-lactamase elaboration by R+ strains was unstable and associated with loss of detectable plasmid DNA at variable frequency. We conclude that in the infant rat model, strains of Hib containing 30 Md ampR plasmids are at a subtle selective disadvantage relative to genetically related, We assessed the relative importance of maternal excretion of CMV in milk and other sites for transmission in 47 breast feeding mother-infant pairs.

There were no significant differences between the CS and NCS groups when analyzed (mean \u00b1 S.D.) for age (18.8 \u00b1 18.1), sex, month and year of admission, day of illness admitted (3 ! 1.2), maximum severity of illness, maximum fever, or weight.Patients with TSS of this initial severity not treated with corticosteroids l1ad fever for 5.8 \u00b1 2.9 days and required supportive therapy until 7.6 \u00b1 3.2 days. Patients in the CS group received a total dose of 36 : 25 mg/kg CS (prednisone equivalent) for 6.4 ! 3.7 days. CS therapy reduced duration of fever (p < 0.05) ifgiven within 3 days of TSS onset, however, a concomitant reduction in severity of illness could not be documented.

Its efficacy in meni ngi tis reported in adults needs further evaluation in children. QUANTITATIVE The antibiotic susceptibility of certain bacteria is markedly affected by inoculum size. In patients with acute otitis media (AOM), clinical response to antibiotic treatment and persistence of middle ear effusion (MEE) may conceivably be influenced by initial MEE colony counts. To determine the usual bacterial burden in patients with AOM quantitative bacterial colony counts were performed on 46 samples of MEF recovered by tympanocentesis. On 25 of the samples Gram stains were performed and read independently. Significant bacterial isolates were recovered in 30 (65%) instances. In 3 samples the colony counts were <102 colony forming units (cfu)/cc while in 27 samples the colony counts ranged from 102 to .'.'._!0 4 cfu/cc. ",

Before S. au:reus infection, plasma obtained from all 54 animals were negative-i;y--the SALA test. After I.P. or I.V. injection with S. aureus, 76% (22/29) of bacteremic animals had positive tests compared to only 21% (3/14) nonbacteremic animals {p<0.05). The 11 animals with osteomyelitis, empyema or peritonitis with culture confirmed deep tissue infection but sterile blood cultures all had positive SALA tests when their plasmas were tested (but not their serum). In the 3 animals with osteomyeli tis the SALA test remained positive until the animals died or their infection was cleared by antibiotics (confirmed at necropsy). Control animals infected with S. In a prospective study of dodecavalent PV, 28 children with ALL, 2.6 to 16.8 years old, had antibody concentrations measured pre-immunization (PRE) and 3D days post-immunization (POST). We found that the geometric mean titers (GMT) of antibody to 7 of the 12 serotypes were> 200 ng/ml POST, but that 3 (serotypes 1, 8, and 12) had also been ) 200 ng/ml PRE. There was at least a 2-fold rise in GMT for 8 of the 12 serotypes. A group of 25 infants and children with acute PV infection were tested for the presence of PV-specific lgE in samples of NPS taken at various intervals after the onset of illness. lgE antibody to PV types I-III in NPS was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using purified PV strains and monospecific goat antisera to human lgE. During the acute phase of illness, antibody against the infecting serotype was detectable in NPS specimens taken from 60% of patients with wheezing and 42% of patients with croup without wheezing. None of 8 patients with upper respiratory illness (URI) alone manifested PV-specific IgE. PV-specific IgE was detectable during convalescence in some patients with all forms of illness, but was observed more commonly and in higher titer (p<0.05) in patients with croup or wheezing than in patients with URI alone. These observations suggest a possible role for the development of virus-specific IgE in the pathogenesis of both croup and wheezing due to PV, in a manner similar to respiratory syncytial virus as described previously. Minnesota Department of Health, Minneapolis. Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a recently described illness characterized by (a) fever, (b) mild or profound hypotension, (c) multisystem dysfunction, (d) skin desquamation 8-12 days after onset, and has been associated with a specific aureus pyrogenic exotoxin. TSS has been described pre ominantly in previously healthy, menstruating women in whom the association with tampon use and cervicovaginal colonization by S. aureus has been recognized. However, affected non-menstruating-patients have also been observed among whom wound infection by S. aureus has frequently been implicated. We describe the fatal course---ora-3-week infant with staphylococcal abscess related to previous heel puncture in the nursery. After three days of marked clinical improvement on IV nafcillin, the patient suddenly deteriorated with rapid progression from lethargy and diaphoresis to ileus, oliguria, cardiomegaly, profound shock and respiratory failure. Post mortem exam confirmed the impression of multisystem involvement including the visceral and cutaneous histopathology characteristic of fatal TSS cases. Multiple ante and post mortem cultures of blood and CSF were sterile, however, wound aspiration cultures grew penicillin-resistant, nafcillin-sensitive S. aureus productive of pyrogenic exotoxin type C. This case, the youngest reported patient with TSS, illustrates another clinical presentation of neonatal staphylococcal disease. Furthermore, it reiterates that TSS is a disease not limited to menstruating women but may also occur in patients with focal aureus infection. Groups of neonatal cotton rats seronegative for RSV antibody were breast fed irranediately after birth, either by their own seronegative mothers, or foster-fed by lactating females who had been infected with live RSV 3-5 weeks prior to delivery of their own litters. The neonates foster-fed by seropositive mothers elicited appreciable levels of RSV-specific JgG antibody in the serum after of breast feeding. However, such reactivity was not observed in the serum of infants breast-fed by their own seronegative mothers. All neonatal animals were infected intranasally with RSV 3 days after beginning of breast feeding. The animals were sacrificed at frequent intervals to determine the degree of RSV shedding and development of antibody response in the serum. Neonates breast-fed by their own seronegative mothers exhibited significantly more virus shedding in their respiratory tract, and earlier and higher degree of RSV-specific serum antibody response than observed in infected infants who EN'IBRIC T'fPE ADENOVIRUS: hN IMPORI'AN!' CAUSE OF GAS- An enteric type of adenovirus (ET Ad) has recently been identified as a causative agent of infantile gastroenteritis. We utilized enzyrrc :inm.moassay and tissue culture techniques to prosspectively evaluate the role of ET Ad in diarrhea occurring in hospitalized infants. We found that ET Ad was associated with 14 of 27 cases of diarrhea occurring during a twelve week study period in the late aut\\.IIlU'l and early winter rronths. Ql the other hand, ET Ad was found in the stool of only 1 child without diarrhea (P<. 001) \u2022 While adenoviruses other than ET Ad were found in the stools of 2 children with diarrhea, such viruses were also found in the stools of 5 of 72 children without diarrhea. Children infected with ET Ad had diarrhea for a rrean of 8.0 days, a period that was longer than that observed in the children with gastroenteritis not associated with ET Ad. Also note\\>.Orthy was the high rate of respiratory syrrptans noted in the children with ET Ad gastroenteritis. Thirteen of the 14 children with ET Ad gastroenteritis had respiratory syrrptans such as cough, rhinorrhea or wheezing and 6 had roentgenographic evidence of pneurronia. In sare cases ET Ad was also isolated fran the respiratory tract of infants with ET Ad gastroenteritis. This study docurents that ET Ad can be an important cause of acute gastrointestinal disease in hospitalized infants and young children.

We have shown that in the ewe low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)levels increase 50% in late pregnancy and fall rapidly to less than nonpregnant values during lactation. The mechanisms responsible for these changes were examined by studying the turnover of plasma LDL and high density lipoproteins(HDL)by following the plasma decay of injected homologous 1 2 sI-LDL and 131I-HDL simultaneously (n=l2). Parameters of LDL metabolism included: a) LDL cholesterol level(mg/dl), b) LDL fractional catabolic rate (fraction of plasma pool/day), and c) LDL protein synthetic rate (mg/day). The mean (\u00b1SE) values for these parameters in 4 physiologic states studied were: I. Nonpregnant:a) 20\u00b12.7, b) .316\u00b1.028, c) 60\u00b18; II.Pregnant (130-140d): a)31\u00b12. 4, b) .810\u00b1.130,c)303\u00b168; III.Postpartum Lactating (5d): a)l5\u00b12.l, b)l.10\u00b1.096, c)l27\u00b115; IV.Postpartum Nonlactating (5d): a)30\u00b13. 4, b) .545\u00b1.015, c)l59\u00b111. HDL metabolism was unaltered. From these data it is apparent that increased LDL catabolism occurs in pregnancy in concert with increased plasma LDL levels(p<.05); thus, the hypercholesteroleiaia of pregnancy must be due to greater LDL synthesis than LDL catabolism. The increased LDL catabolism seen with lactation (p<.05 comparing pregnant and nonpregnant) is incompletely compensated by LDL synthesis; thus, plasma LDL falls. At least a portion of the increased LDL catabolism of pregnancy may reflect transfer of LDL-C to the fetus and its increased conversion to steroid hormones; whereas the increased LDL catabolism in lactation may reflect secretion of LDL-C into milk. The mechanisms responsible for elevations in very low density lipoproteins(VLDL)and low density lipoproteins(LDL)and for hypercholesterolemia in normal, pregnant women in the 3rd trimester are unknown. An animal model is needed to investigate these mechanisms in detail;thus, we sought to ascertain if the pregnant ewe could be used. Sheep plasma lipoproteins were isolated quantitatively by ultracentrifugation and the cholesterol(C) content of each fraction quantitated. Plasma total C in nonpregnant,pregnant(l30-140dh postpartum lactating(5d) and postpartum nonlactating(5d) sheep were 55\u00b17.6(X\u00b1SE), 74\u00b13.2, 56\u00b12.6 and 67\u00b11.4 mg/dl, respectively. The changes in total plasma C were largely a result of alterations in the LDL-C fraction(d=l.020-1.063 g/ml), which averaqed 20\u00b12.3 mg/dl in the nonpregnant animals, increased to 31\u00b12.4 mg/dl in the third trimester, decreased to 15\u00b12.1 mg/dl during lactation, but remained elevated at 30\u00b13.4 mg/dl in the nonlactating postpartum animals. LDL-C levels in nonpregnant, pregnant and lactating ewes were significantly different(p<0.05). There were no significant changes in the high density lipoproteins(HDL)-C and VLDL-C levels. We conclude that the ewe is a reasonable model in which to study the hypercholesterolemia of pregnancy. In addition, the results are consistent with the view that LDL-C provides at least a portion of C secreted in the milk of the ewe. Finally, we hypothesize that these alterations in plasma LDL-C levels are the result of purturbations in the rate of catabolism of LDL while the catabolism of HDL and VLDL are relatively constant.

Sialic acid storage disease has been defined in a patient with neurovisceral storage of the monosaccharide N-Acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid) in lysosomes. Tissues and skin fibroblasts contain more than 200 times more sialic acid than normal. Studies have been undertaken to determine if the accumulation is due to excessive synthesis or defective degradation. Sialic acid lyase, the enzyme believed responsible for sialic acid degradation was normal in activity in liver extracts, although it could not be detected in normal or affected The lyase activity detected by the formation of c 3 N-acetylmannosamine from C-sialic acid. Incorporation of H-mannosamine into sialic acid-containing glycolipids and glycoproteins was slightly elevated. The pool of sialic acid available for synthesis is thus not increased despite excessive cellular sialic acid. This suggests enhanced de novo synthesis of sialic acid and a failure in reutilization of sialic acid derived from sialoglycoconjugate degradation. Sialic acid storage disease probably involves a defect in translocation of sialic acid from lysosomes to the site of biosynthesis.

The addition of CN to rat tissue and mitochondrial preparations is said to increase the production of 1 4 co2 from [1-l'\u2022c]LEU by stimulating the activity of the branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKAD). In our laboratory, CN increased the oxidation of [l-14 C]LEU in rat muscle homogenates to 174 \u00b1 12% of control levels (N=J); in contrast, CN decreased the oxidation of [2-14 C)LEU to 73 \u00b1 19% of control levels in the same homogenates (N=J). Similarly, addition of CN did not increase the oxidation of [l-14 C]LEU by suspensions of human skin fibroblasts derived from either normal controls or patients with classical maple syrup urine disease. CN did not increase the dehydrogenation of [2,J-3 H]isovaleryl-CoA ( 3 H-IVA-CoA) or [2,3-3 H]butyryl CoA ( 3 H-BUT-CoA) in intact rat liver mitochondria (80 \u00b1 30% and 111 115% of control values, respectivelv; N=7).

The CN-dependent increase in 3 H-BUT-CoA dehydrogenation was completely blocked by octylsulfobetaine, an inhibitor of acyl-CN translocase. CN does not seem to stimulate the overall rate of degradation of the branched chain amino acids (BCAA) in either human skin fibroblasts or rat tissues, and BCKAD does not appear to be the rate limiting enzyme in the catabolism of the BCAA. Insulin mediates rapid (transport) as well as delayed (e.g. cell growth) effects on cellular metabolism. Since the HL-60 cell, a human promyelocytic cell, can be cultured in defined medium plus insulin, we studied the effect of insulin concentration on cell duplication and [1251]-iodoinsulin binding parameters. The HL-60 cell line was grown in RPM! 1640 medium plus 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) or in medium plus insulin (0-5 ug/ml; 0-8.3xl0-7 M). The insulin binding studies were performed with [1251]-monoiodoinsulin. The binding isotherms and displacement curves were analyzed by least-square fitting to a 2-site model and by the method of Scatchard. Cellular doubling times ranged from 1.85 days in 10% FBS and 2.08 days in insulin (8.3xl0-7M) to greater than 3.5 days at insulin concentrations below (l.67xl0-8M). There was net cell death below lx10-lOM. The half maximal doubling rate occurred at 4.0+10-9M insulin (\"KD\"=2.5xl08M-l). A high affinity, low capacity insulin binding site was defined with KA 3.l:t<J.5xl08M-l for cells cultured in 10% FBS. The site number was approximately 10,000 per cell. There is a trend toward more avid binding to a high affinity site as the insulin concentration is lowered and a sharp decline in cell growth at insulin concentration below lx10-lOM. Whether the effects of insulin on cellular growth are mediated through insulin receptors defined above or through other growth factor binding sites cannot be determined from these data. 140 2 to 25yr old siblings of 67 children with TDD had 2 hr. oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) in 1969-71.

Results in diabetics are compared to agematched normal controls (*P<0.05-0.005 vs prepump).DiabeticsTo evaluate if the metabolic and hormonal changes induced by pump Rx alters cellular growth, we measured proliferative capacity of erythroid committed stem cells (BFU-E) obtained from peripheral blood in 4 subjects.

Glycogen storage disease, type 1 (GSD1), results from a defect in hydrolysis of p;lucose-6-phosphate, blocking glucose (Glu) production (Ra) from either glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis. However, Glu Ra is 60% of normal in adults with GSD1 in whom hypoglycemia is not a major problem. To determine whether the severe hypoglycemia in GSD1 children results from a relatively greater defect in Glu Ra or Glu utilization (Rd), Glu flux, using 6,6-dideuterop;lucose, was determined in 5 GSD1 and 5 normal children. Plasma Glu and Glu Ra were 85 mg/dl and 6.3 mg/kg\u2022min, respectively, in controls. To establish steady-state conditions, GSD1 children were infused with cold Glu for 2 hr at 6, 3 and 1.5 mg/kg\u2022min at each rate during flux determinations; Glu decreased from 78 to 54 and 45 mg/dl, respectively. Endogenous Glu Ra increased (1.5, 2.0 and 3.1 mg/kg\u2022min, respectively) during decreasing cold Glu infusion.When Glu infusion was stopped in 4 GSD1, endogenous Glu Ra increased to 3.9 mg/kg\u2022min but Rd exceeded Ra, resulting in a decrease in plasma Glu from 50 to 45 mg/dl. In summary: 1) Endogenous Glu Ra in GSD1 children is \"'60% of normal, and fails to be completely suppressed durinp; infusion of Glu at 6 mg/kg\u2022min; 2) the fall in plasma Glu associated with discontinuation of cold Glu infusion resulted from higher Glu Rd than Ra, despite an increase in endop;enous Glu Ra. In conclusion: Stabilization of Glu homeostasis with age in GSD1 is most likely the result of a relative decrease in Glu utilization, perhaps related to changes in brain weight to body size ratio, and not a proportional increase in Glu production.

Two dimensional echocardiography was used to verify sample volume position in selected patients.An incidence angle of o 0 was assumed; the aortic diameter ( d) was determined by M-mode echocardiography. Aortic flow (DA 0 ) computed from Doppler was according to tne equation: DA (ml/min)=V (cm/sec) x \"d /4 (cm ) x 60 (sec/min).Values we'f.e compared with Fick determined systemic outputs (QA ) , calculated using measured oxygen consumption, oxygen caii'aci ty and oxygen saturations. Subjects with aortic valve abnormalities or left ventricular ?utflow tract obstruction were excluded from study.Agreement between the two methods was excellent (linear regression r:0.98, slope:l.14, S .;r=218 ml/min, range to 5500 ml/min). The Doppler method quick, non-invasive and accurate, especially in smaller patients. Liver dysfunction associated with prolonqed hyperalimentation is seen frequently during the neonatal period.It has been postulated that increased GGT activity is a specific reflection of hepatic canalicular dysfunction. Two groups of premature infants were followed for up to four months with weekly GGTs determined by the assay of Szasz.Infants receiving anti-convulsants were excluded from this study. One group of eight premature infants (BW x 1310 + 271 gms, x GA 32 weeks) received glucose infusions and breast and/or formula. From this qroup, the mean GGT level of 148 + 100 IU/L (range 41-354 IU/L).was found to be more elevated than-previously reported for premature infants. No significant correlation was found between GGT levels and age as determined by Pearson correlations and the Fisher 7 transformation method. Nine other infants (BW 1083 + 340 qms, GA 30 weeks) received hyperalimentation (glucose and amino acids) for variable periods with a range of 5-144 days and a x of 57 days.By the methods reported above, a significant correlation was found between duration of hyperalimentation and GGT levels (r=+.59). From these pre! iminary data, it appears that GGT levels may have clinical significance, that the ranae of normal levels for premature infants should be reevaluated, and that there is a positive correlation between GGT activity and duration of intravenous hyperalimentation. Infants that were sick on days l and 7 did not demonstrate a postnatal rise in activity 33 ! 6.4, 47 \u2022 8.3, p=0.3), however, infants that had been sick on day l but by day 7 were healthy had increasing protease activity 24 \u00b1 7.2 117 o l7.0, P<0.001). In addition, sick infants had significantly lower levels than healthy infants on all days studied (P<0.001). We conclude that there is increasing kallikrein-likc activity in unactivated plasma of healtl1y premature infants during the first month of life. Sickness significantly lowers the activity and prevents the postnatal rise. We speculate that in sick inf ants either the protease is not generated to the same degree or is largely bound to plasma 1bis study investigated the influence of gestational age (GA) and postnatal age mi the following plasma protease inhibitors: a 7 -macroglobulin (a 2 -M), c 1 -Esterase (C 1 E-!NH), anti-thrombin Ill (i'\\T-11!) and a 1 -antltrypsin (a 1 -AT). Premature infants (28-36 weeks gestation) were studied on days I (N=31), 7 (N=31) and 28 (N=l l) of life.Inhibitors were measured by radial-immunodiffusion and expressed as a percent of normal pnoled plasma (mean SEM). infants witl1 disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (fibrinogen <120 mg/dl, or factor VIII: coag <50%, or fibrin related antigen >6.7 \u00b5g/ml) were not included. Between 28 and 36 weeks there was no significant correlation with GA for any of the four inhibitors. fn contrast, regardless of GA, during the first of life all four inhibitors increased significantly Vitamin C is accumulated in the brain by active transport mechanisms which establish a high brain-plasma gradient of the vitamin A damaqinq insult to the CNS may result in an efflux of ascorbate into the circulation with a consequent rise of plasma levels. We have determined vitamin C plasma levels by the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine method in premature newborns on days 1, 3 and 5 of life while no supplemental vitamin was given. The infants underwent ultrasonographic examinations to detect PVH/IVH and were qrouped accordinq to the following findings: Group I -normal; Group I Iperiventricular hemorrhage + minimal IVH; Group I I I -IVH + ventricular dilatation + intracerebral hemorrhage. Seventy consecutive preterm infants with birth weight (BW) of 1500 gm or less were screened daily for intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) during the first week of life using real time ultrasound scans. Mean BW and gestational age (GA) were 1133 \u00b1 282 gm and 31 \u00b1 2.2 weeks respectively. Mean Apgar Scores at land 5 min were 4 ! 3 and 6 \u00b1 3 respectively. Fifty-five (79%) infants developed IVH, and in 48 (87%), IVH was diagnosed within 24hours of age. Forty-two (60%) infants were delivered vaginally and 28(40%) by C-section. The following table compares vaginally delivered and C-sectioned infants according to the mean BW, GA, Apgar Sccrcs, the incidence of IVH, and mortality rate. Chi square analysis showed no statistical significant difference between the incidence of IVH and mortality rate in the vaginally delivered and C-sectioned infants. These data show that there appears to be no association between the incidence of IVH and mode of delivery. Postgrad. School Obstet. Gynecol., Univ. Auckland, Auckland, N.Z.Prenatal corticosteroid therapy is efficacious in preventing RDS, but optimal treatment conditions are not yet defined. We determined corticoid concentrations in cord serum of 75 premature (25-36 wk) infants whose mothers received 100 mg hydrocortisone (HC) q 8\u00b0 prior to delivery, and compared results with previous data for Betamethasone (Beta) therapy (12 mg q 24\u00b0 or 6 mg q 12\u00b0).Corticoids were assayed by competitive protein binding after petroleum ether washing, free corticoids were assessed by charcoal absorption, and dissociation of tritiated steroid from nuclei was studied after washing fetal rabbit lung in culture. Total corticoids were maximal 1-2 hr after HC (mean 32.1 \u00b5g/dl vs. 8.4 for 84 untreated infants) and levels declined with a -2 hr vs.12 hr for clearance of Beta. Endogenous corticoids were suppressed 8-20 hr after the last dose of HC (5.1 :!: 0.4 \u00b5g/dl, mean\u00b1 SE), but less so than with Beta (3.3 \u00b1 0.3 and 3.6 \u00b1 0.5 for 12 and 6 mg regimens, respectively). Maximal serum levels of free glucocorticoid activity were 11.6 \u00b5g/dl with HC therapy, 8.3 \u00b5g/dl with 12 mg Beta, and 5.1 \u00b5g/dl with 6 mg Beta compared with 1.6 \u00b5g/dl in untreated infants. Dissociation values were 1.4 and 7.4 hr for HC and dexamethasone, respectively. We conclude that the 100 mg HC regimen results in higher unbound serum corticoid concentrations, greater fluctuations and faster clearance of steroid from serum and lung tissue, and less suppression of endogenous cortisol than treatment with Beta.",

Fifteen families with 26 children (ages 2 to 16) were assigned to a control group. Fifteen boys and 16 girls were in the study group and 13 boys and 13 girls were in the control group. The mean age was 8.7 yrs for boys and 6.7 for girls, and was similar for both groups. Assessment tools included: the Missouri Behavior Checklist (MBC) administered just before and two weeks following the visit; a Modified Vernon Questionnaire (MVQ), a Family Changes Questionnaire (FCQ) and a Child Psychiatry evaluation given two weeks after the visit. The number of behavioral problems (MBC) did not change for either group. Apparent improvement occurred for both child {MVQ) and family {FCQ) functioning in study and control groups. Parents perceived improvement in 74% of the study and 40% of control families (p<.05). By psychiatric evaluation none of the study children were upset by the visit; 72% enjoyed and 28% enjoyed and demonstrated benefit.

Following removal, Staphylococcus cpidermidis was grown from the culture of 1/19 steel needles and 1/25 catheters. In both instances blood cultures were negative and this was felt to be a contaminant. Teflon catheters remain functional three times longer than steel needles with no apparent increase in complications. The use of these catheters, therefore, appears to be the preferred method for administering intravenous fluids to premature infants. Increased lung superoxide dismutase(SOD) and glutathione peroxidase(GP) activity during hyperoxic exposure has been shown to be associated with tolerance to pulrronary oxygen(0 2 ) toxicity in newtorn animals of several species. Antioxidant enzyme RBC levels were monitored prospectively, as a reflection of lung changes, in 44 newtorns requiring O therapy and/or exchange transfusion, to detennine if in SOD or GP could be related to the clinical course of these infants. Clinical Grouping (n) Serial SOD Levels* Serial GP Levels* Severe One Hundred and Fourty cases of NEC have been diagnosed between 1975 and 1981 in this center. Sixty-Eight infants(49%) required only medical managenent. The mortality in this group was 24 percent (16 infants). Of the surviving 52 infants, follow-up evaluations ranging fran 6 months to 5 years performed in 26 infants (50%) indicate that 73% are growing normally and 77% have normal develop mental exams. In marked contrast to these medically managed infants are the 51 percent who required surgical intervention. Ten of these infants required surgery late for strictures that developed after their initial medical rnanagenent. One infant died during surgery, 57% had abnormal developnent exams and 43% had abnormal growth patterns. In the 62 infants undergoing inrrediate surgical interventions, there was a 69% mortality rate, alrrost triple that of the infants not requiring surgery. Of the 19 infants who survived, 12(63%) were seen in follow up between six months and five years. Sixty-Six percent of these infants have significantly retarded growth patterns and 66% are developnentally delayed for their age. This dismal outccrne of infants requiring surgical intervention for NEC is in marked contrast to previously published reports.

            "text": "continuously for skin temperature by an electronic thermistor taped to the abdomen. Skin temperature feeds back to the servocontrol mechanism which determines the radiant power density delivered to the infant. Characteristically, the radiant warmer cycles through warming and cooling phases. Shielding temperature probes with a small square of foam rubber covered by reflective foil is recommended to prevent artifactual heating of the thermistor by the radiant warmer during the warming phase.To determine the effect of thermistor shielding on infant heat demand, 10 premature neonates (birthweight 1.70 ! .12 SEM kg, gestational age 32.6 ! .7 wks) were studied to measure mean radiant power density for one hour with and one hour without probe shielding. Data were also analyzed to determine the average duration of warming and cooling cycles under the warmer. There was a significant increase in cycle duration with shielding (1.76 ! .15 min/cycle vs. 3.06 ! .39 min/cycle, p <..02). Shielding had no effect on mean radiant power density received by infants (15.6 ! 1.0 mw/cm2 vs. 15.9 ! 1.2 mw/cm2 shielded, p >.5). Shielding had no effect on skin temperature, heart and respiratory rates, or ambient temperature and humidity. These data demonstrate that shielding probes produces lower frequency cycling for infants under radiant warmers without changing radiant power density received at the infant's skin. The effect of attenuated warming and cooling cycles on peripheral vascular stability and oxygen consumption remains to be determined. Previous studies of intravenously and orally administered alanine to normoglycemic small and large for gestational age newborns have not resulted in increased gluconeogenesis. This study was done to evaluate the effect of alanine loading in the presence of hypoglycemia in the first hours of life, Twelve infants 1-3 hours of age (mean weight:3280 grams; 37 weeks gestational age with apgar scores of 7-10) who maintained initial blood glucose values of less than 38 mg/dl for 30 minutes were given 500 mg of L-alanine/kg as a 10% solution in .45% sodium chloride by nasogastric tube. Venous samples were taken pre-gavage and at 30,60 and 180 minutes thereafter for serum glucose, insulin, alanine and glucagon determinations with the following results: Because of the increased risk of premature inf ants for infantile apnea and sudden infant death syndrome, we selected 11 of 38 infants ready for discharge for 12 hour nocturnal cardiorespirogram recordings. Birthweights were under 2000 g and gestational ages 34 weeks or less. They had completed a course of theophylline for apnea and/or had intraventricular hemorrhage, or neurologic abnormalities. 10 of 11 recordings were abnormal: excessive (>3.5%) periodic breathing (PB), apnea (>15 sec), or brndycardia (<80 bpm). After reinstitution of theophylline treatment (mean level 9.07; range 7.25-12.13 mcg/ml) the repeat recordings of 9 infants were normal; one required phenobarbital for normalization. III vs I) were more common in group III and pulmonary hypertension and coagulopathy in group II (p<.01 II vs III). There were no differences in the incidence of asphyxia, CNS hemorrhage or PDA.Doi.>arnine and isupr.el were used more often in group II (p< .03 III vs I, II). Pavulon was used more often in group II (p<.03 II vs III). There was no difference in the use of tolazoline. The mortality of group III was 73% compared to 43% for group II and 22% for group I (p<.001 III vs I; p<.05 II vs I). Abnormalities in variability probably reflect poor peripheral circulation.We suggest that evaluation of tc tracings for variability may provide information concerning the adequacy of the peripheral circulation and may be of prognostic value. To determine factors contributing to SEH/IVH, confounding variables related to neonatal disease were eliminated by analysis of 44 of 246 infants (<34 wks/2000gm) selected by Apgars at 5 minutes, normal fetal pH, <15 hr intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV), and no POA. SEH/IVH was diagnosed by frequent tri-dimensional ultrasound within the first hours of I ife. Major (8) (16) were similar for al I variables. Vaginally delivered infants had a higher incidence of total & major SEH/IVH than C-section infants (no major IVH/SEH). Follow-up (6-24 months) reveals only 2/16 infants with major neurologic deficit. The factors identified here for SEH/IVH represent the risks of prematurity alone for SEH/IVH and its consequences during development.",

Univ. of Cal if., San Diego, Dept. of Pediatrics, La Joi la, Ca Ii f.Hydrocephalus is a frequent complication of large intraventricular hemorrhages. Hypoxanthine, the end product of purine metabolism, which is elevated during brain ischemia indicating icant compromise of cell integrity, was measured in 13 hydrocephal ic tiny infants (12 posthemorrhagic, I congenital hydrocephalus) to determine whether hydrocephalus is associated with anaerobic metabolism of brain tissue. lntraventricular hemorrhages & progressive ventricular size were diagnosed with repeated ultrasound studies of the infants' brains. Hypoxanthine concentrations in CSF (normal 0-3\u00b5m/L) increased significantly (x=l4.8\u00b5m/L, range 7.5-28\u00b5m/L) in progressive hydrocephalus, with or without overt signs of intracranial hypertension. Normal values or significant decrease in hypoxanthine were obtained when hydrocephalus was successfully treated or ventricular size was transiently stabilized by LP's or VP shunts. Actual ventricular size seemed not to correlate with hypoxanthine concentration although each case tended to have high concentrations when there was progressive ventricular enlargement. Patients with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus in the first month of 1 ife had similar high concentrations (x=14.5\u00b5m/L) as patients with \"late\" (age 1 or> mos) posthemorrhagic or with congenital hydrocephalus suggesting that anaerobic metabolism is mainly a consequence of ventricular enlargement. Plexiglas head hoods (PGH) are often used to administer supplementary oxygen or to measure respiratory gas exchange of infants. Since Plexiglas is impermeable to heat energy radiated from the body, we theorized that PGH might reduce radiant heat loss (R) from the head and, thus, possibly reduce body heat loss (HL). We measured metabolic heat production (M) and HL of 6 AGA premature infants in an incubator with PGH (top replaced with 0.013-fllll polyethylene, Glad and with a head hood (PEH) of polyethylene stretched over a rectangular frame made of thin tubular steel. Each infant was studied with PGH and PEH on the same day, with skin temperature servocontrolled to 36.5\u00b0C. After thermal equi]ibration, oxygen consumption (vo,), carbon dioxide production (VC0 7 ), and insensible water loss (IWL) were measured continuously for 2 hours with each hood. M and HL were calculated and partitioned into evaporation (E) , radiation (R), and the sum (C) of convection and conduction. The means are shown below, V0 2 and VC0 2 in ml/ (kg\u00b7min), IWL in ml/(kg\u00b7h), and M, HL, E, Rand C in kcal/(kq-h): Premature infants treated for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) may develop reversible bronchospasm during the first year of life. It is unclear whether this airway hyperreactivity is related to initial management or to hereditary factors. Twenty-one premature infants, mechanically ventilated for RDS, followed for bronchospasm beginning before 6 months of age, were matched with 21 similar infants with no bronchospasm during the first year of life. No significant differences existed between infants with bronchospasm (B) and their matched controls (C) for (mean! SEM): birth wt. (1.15 ! .06 vs. 1.13 ! .09 kg); GA (30 ! 0.5 vs. 29 ! 0.4 wks); duration of oxygen exposure (35.6 ! 6.5 vs. 39.6 ! 6.4 days); and duration of ventilatory assistance (455 ! 10& vs. 451 ! 9& hrs). 13/21 B babies and 14/21 C babies had radiologic evidence of BPD. Family history of bronchospasm was considered positive if first or second degree relatives had asthma prior to age 20 requiring hospital treatment and bronchodilators. 14/21 (67%) infants with bronchospasm vs. 3/21 (14.3%) control infants had positive family histories (p <.001). Patients requiring continuous bronchodilator therapy for symptom control (n= 15) were compared to those needing only intermittent therapy for acute exacerbations (n=6). 9/15 (60%) requiring continuous therapy had first degree relatives with positive histories vs. 1/6 (17%) in the intermittent therapy group (p <.02). Thus, a strong family history of bronchospasm may be a predisposing factor in the development of airway hyperreactivity in premature infants requiring ventilatory therapy for RDS. The closer the affected relative, the greater the tendency for the bronchospasm to be of a more severe nature. Oxygenation decreases after nasogastric (NG) feeding but increases during nonnutritive sucking (NNS/pacifier) in premature infants recovering from RDS. To evaluate changes in oxygenation during NG feedings given with a pacifier, we studied 15 clinically stable premature infants (mean! SEM birth wt. 1.2 ! 0.3 kg and GA 31.0 ! 1.5 wk) who were given a pacifier during and for JO min. after an NG feed (NNS). The same infants were studied within 24 hrs. during an NG feed without a pacifier (control). Studies were done during transition from NG to oral feeds when the sucking reflex was well-developed. Transcutaneous Oz (TcP02) was monitored prior to, during and for 30 min. after each NG feeding. Pre-feeding TcP02 levels were comparable in both studies (5& ! 3.0 vs. 59 ! 2.9 mmHg, (N.S.) ). TcPOz values during NNS rose significantly to 64.7 ! 3.0 mmHg (p<. 0.001) by the end of the feeding, remained elevated for 20 min. and returned to baseline levels by 25 min. after feeding. Conversely, TcP02 measurements in control studies fell to 57.2 ! 2.& mmHg (p< 0.01) immediately after feeding, continued to fall for 20 min. (52.2 ! 3.0 mmHg, p < 0.001) and gradually returned to baseline levels by 30 min. Significant differences in TcPOz values between the 2 study periods were noted immediately after feeding and for 20 min thereafter (p< 0.1). Conclusion: Our study suggests that NNS during NG feedings prevents the decrease in oxygenation found after routine gavage feedings in premature infants. The improved TcPOz values while sucking might represent a physiologic response that is important to meet the increased caloric demands associated with feedings. Neurologic abnormalities occur commonly in low birthweight (LBW) premature infants during the first year of life, but often are transient. Developmental problems may be identified by the age at which abnormalities of muscle tone, reflex activity, and posture normalize. To determine the relationship between the age of normalization and developmental sequelae, we studied 21 infants with birthweight (mean :!: SD) 1.25 :!: 1.89 kg and gestational age 31 :!: 1.5 wks. Infants were evaluated for neurologic abnormalities at 3,6,9 and 12 mos adjusted age (AA). Development was assessed at 12 mos AA using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development.Neurologic exam revealed that infants were either l) normal at 3 mos; 2) normalized by 6 mos; 3) normalized by 12 mos; or 4) abnormal at 12 mos. Bayley scores varied in accord with these different ages of neurologic normalization. Mean scores were: Groups 1 and 2 (n=8) = 93.4 :!: 5.8 (normal range); Groups 3 and 4 (n=l 3)=70.5 :!: 11.2 (borderline to abnormal range), p '.001. Our study demonstrated a clear relationship between age of neurologic normalization and developmental progress. Early absence or resolution of abnormalities suggested favorable development at 12 mos. Persistence of abnormalities to 12 mos or beyond was related to either borderline or abnormal functioning. Conclusion: Although neurologic abnormalities are common in LBW preterm infants, they are not merely a transient phenomenon without significance. Regular neurologic assessment during the 1st year of life may be used to distinguish, as early as 3-6 mos, 16 preterm infants were given gentamicin (2.5 mg/kg/dose q 6 hours) orally as a prophylaxis against necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). None of these infants received systemic gentamicin. Infants with NEC or NEC like symptoms were excluded from the study. Their weight and gestational age was 1.39 + 0.37 kg and 30.6 + 2. 7 weeks respectively. Their mean apgar sC\"ore was 5 and 8 at one and five minutes respectively. All infants had respiratory distress syndrome and 12 out of 16 needed artificial ventilation. 12 infants had umbilical arterial catheters inserted. 9 out of 16 infants had serum gentamicin levels done at mean postnatal age of 1.7 days. l of those 9 infants had no detectible gentamicin level. The serum gentamicin level of the remaining 8 infants varied from 1.2 to 7 with mean of 2.5 Serum gentamicin level on other 7 infants was done at a mean postnatal age of 12 days. No gentamicin could be detected in the serum from 3 infants. The serum gentamicin levels on the remaining 4 infants was less than 2 \u00b5gm/ml. We suggest that orally administered gentamicin can be absorbed in preterm infants especially during the first few days of life. Infants on simultaneous oral and systemic gentamicin may be at a greater risk of toxicity .. 12 hour urinary excretion of VMA, HVA and MHPG were studied in 24 premature infants, 14 with apnea and 10 without apnea. Their birth weight and gestational age was 0.95 + 0.21 kg, 27.9 + 2.2 weeks and l.22 + 0.19 kg, 30.3 + 1.8 weeks-respectively. All infants were stud1ed before apnea-(l-3 days of postnatal age). Nonapneic infants were also studied at 10-15 days. Apneic infants were studied again 24 hours after apnea. The concentration of various biogenic amine metabolites expressed as \u00b5gm/kg body weigtt .i_ll_W) andcreatinine ( The excretion of VMA and MHPG did not significantly decrease with the onset of apnea. Only HVA when expressed as body weight was significantly lower in apneic infants. We conclude that apnea of prematurity is not associated with inhibition or immaturity of adrenergic pathways. Saralasin, an angiotensin II antagonist, has been used extensively to evaluate hypertension in adults. We measured the blood pressure (BP, rnrnHg) response to an infusion of saralasin in four hypertensive infants to determine its safety and efficacy in that age group. Prior to each infusion, we performed a renal scan and measured basal plasma renin activity (PRA, ng/ml/hr 3 months 0.2 125/73 112/52 Hyperaldosteronism The patients with high PRA levels (A and B) had marked decreases in BP during the infusion, while those with normal (C) or low (D) PRA had little or no response. The saralasin infusion was continued for two days in patient B, who had malignant hypertension unresponsive to conventional antihypertensive therapy, including nitroprusside. Patient D had normal findings on aortogram, renal angiogram, and renal vein PRA measurements, but a high plasma aldosterone level (36.7 ng/dl).We have demonstrated that the change in BP during an infusion of saralasin can rapidly and safely determine the contribution of the renin-angiotensin system to hypertension in infants and aid in the selection of appropriate antihypertensive therapy. Ninety-four patients with polycythemia and hyperviscosity (HV) were assigned randomly to partial pldsma exchange (Exch) or observation (NExch) and were matched with a non-polycythemic control. No group differed in socioeconomic class, apgar scores, resuscitation, meconiurn staining, weight or gestational age. Maternal pre-eclampsia was more conunon in HV patients (p<0.02).",

            "text": "In 1942 Warren and Drinker reported that breathing movements have an important influence on filtration of fluid into the lungs (Am J Physiol 136:207). What happens when normal breathing movements stop, as they do during high-frequency vibratory ventilation? To answer that question, we measured pulmonary arterial (PA) and left atrial (LA) pressures, pleural (PL) and airway (AW) pressures, lung blood flow and lymph flow, and concentrations of protein in lymph and plasma of 7 healthy lambs, 2-3 wks old, during a 2-4 h period of spontaneous breathing (SB), followed by 4-8 h of mechanical ventilation (MV) at 30 breaths/min and 4-8 h of vibratory ventilation (VV), in which the lambs received 1500 whiffs of air/min from an Emerson Airway Vibrator. The lambs were unmedicated during SB, but received pancuronium and morphine dur!ng MV and VV. We alternated the sequence of MV Lymph flow was less and lymph:plasma protein ratio greater in VV than in MV, consistent with reduced lung fluid filtration during VV. In lambs killed after 8 h of VV, extravascular lung water was normal and microscopy showed no edema. We conclude that VV has no adverse effect on lung fluid balance and may provide a benefit to lambs by decreasing net filtration of fluid into their lungs. ln order to access the value of \"booster transfusion\" in the premature infant, a randomized trial was performed. Infants less than 1500 gms. at birth were randomized to be transfused to keep their hemoglobin level above 10.0 g/dl. or they were allowed to drop their hemoglobin. There were 56 infants enrolled on the study: 26 in the transfusion group and 30 in the non-transfused group. Analysis at the end of the study shows that the groups were well-matched for gestational age (mean 29.6 wks.) and birth weight (mean 1160 gms.). All children were transfused to replace iatrogenic blood loss, and in clinical states associated with acute blood loss or shock. Exchange transfusion was performed as necessary for the management of jaundice. In the non-transfused group, patients could also be transfused if required for surgery, if no weight gain for seven days on 140 cal/kg/day, or tachycardia greater than 170 BPM consistently for four days. cal analysis of the clinical course of these patients shows no difference between groups in terms of length of stay in the hospital, discharge weight, incidence or severity of apnea. There was a difference at the P (.001 level between groups in the discharge hemoglobin level and reticulocyte count. The non-transfused infants also had increased weight gain/day significant at the p (.OS level. This unexpected finding was not due_ to? difference in the incidence of clinical PDA. Our conclusion is that there is no clinical advantage to maintaining the hemoglobin above 10.0 g/dl in the pre-term infant. During the first 5 days of life, the phospholipid content of tracheal effluent from 12 infants (28-35 GA) with severe RDS was measured to identify specific deficiencies and to determine their rate of recovery. On each infant's daily pooled specimen, total phospholipid (PL) and disaturated phosphatidylcholine ( DSPC) were quantified and the presence of phosphat i dyglycero l (PG) detern1i ned. Values in the RDS group were compared to measurements on specimens collected during the first day of life from 7 control infants (27-36 GA) being ventilated for apnea or transient tachypnea. Compared to controls, infants with RDS had less PL and DSPC on Day l (p<.01). A gradual increase in both PL and DSPC began on Day 3 and reached values similar to controls after Day 4. No change in %DSPC in the RDS group was observed; %DSPC in RDS and control groups was similar. PG was always absent in the RDS group on Day l but appeared coincident with the rise in DSPC and PL. PG was a variable finding in controls. We conclude that the early deficiency of DSPC, PG, and PL in infants with severe RDS resolves by the fifth day of life. Most cases of GBS early-onset sepsis appear to have en intrepertum pathogenesis. A tteck rates ere increased in infants born to women with premature labor or prolonged rupture of membranes. We have carried out a randomized study of the effect of intrapartum parenteral empicillin (2 gm IV, followed by 1 gm IV Q4H) on GBS vertical transmission in infants born to high-risk perturient women with prenatal GBS colonization. Cultures of throat, umbilicus, rectum, external ear, gastric contents, end blood were obtained from study infants in the delivery room at birth. A dramatic reduction in GBS vertical transmission occurred in infants born to high-risk mothers who were treated with ampicillin. Blood cultures were positive (*) in 4 heavily colonized infants whose mothers were not treated with ampicillin; no blood cultures were positive among infants whose mothers were treated (p = .17 AMNIOTIC FLUID VOLUME AND FETAL SWALLOWING RATE.",

In order to obtain baseline data on normal baboon pregnancies, amniotic fluid volume (AFV) was determined by para-amino-hippurate (PAH) dilution in 39 pregnancies ranging from 88 to 173 days in duration. Amniotic fluid volume averaged 257\"(Sll) 71.l ml (range: 126-392ml) and did not vary with gestational maturity. Fetal swallowing rate (FSR) was determined in 6 pregnancies at 138-149 days in animals whose PAH-determined AFV's ranged from 178 to 309 ml.Inulin dilution was used, AF samples being obtained prior to injection and approximately 4, 8 and 24 hours later. The Ln of AF inulin concentrations decreased as a straight line whose slope multiplied by PAH-dctermined AFV yielded FSR's that averaged 18.8!5.37 ml/hour (12.3-25.8ml/h). These data suggest (1) that AFV of baboons is similar to that of humans, considering the differences in body weight for mother and fetus (1/3 of human); and (2) No osmotic diuresis was seen. Urinary Na/K ratio was(l in 25/40 patients. A negative correlation was seen between FENa & GER (r = -.38, p c05).

Shapiro, Univ. of Rochester, Dept. of Pediatrics & Div. of Social Work, Rochester, New York.Neonatology is reputed to be a stressful pediatric subspecialty. To objectively quantify this stress and assess the factors involved, a questionnaire was mailed to neonatologists in the northeastern United States. 97 (70%) replied. A 5-point scale was used to determine level of satisfaction with neonatology as a career and stress experienced at work. Preliminary analysis of these questionnaires has indicated the following: almost all neonatologists experienced stress at work: 32% moderately severe and 16% very severe stress. Open-ended questions indicated the major causes of stress were (a) excessive work load, e.g., on call too often or late calls (36%), (b) patient care (36%) especially dealing with infant death, and (c) staff disagreements (32%) especially nurse or housestaff conflicts. 20% of those surveyed suffered a stress related illness in the past 5 years. One sixth of the neonatologists were either moderately or very dissatisfied with neonatology. Major dissatisfactions were: (a) too much work (48%); (b) lack of resources (32%) including inadequate salary; (c) stress of clinical responsibility (20%); and (d) administrative demands (16%). Satisfactions included patient care (62%); teaching (24%), intellectual stimulation (22%) and research (15%). Altering subspecialty has been considered at some time by 58% (15% very seriously). Preliminary results of this study confirm that neonatology is a highly stressful career. Identification of causes of stress among neonatologists may ultimately lead to appropriate intervention strategies. According to current views, the Prostaglandin Ez (PGEz) that maintains patency of the ductus arteriosus (DA) is formed intramurally and exerts its action locally on muscle cells. We recently found that newborn lambs with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) have higher plasma PGEz concentrations (pulmonary artery (PA)=l69\u00b152, aorta (Ao)=80\u00b111 pg/ml, n=6) than those with a constricted DA (PA=23\u00b13 Ao=20\u00b13 pg/ml, n=8). To see if these concentrations of PGEz could produce patency of the DA, we used 5 near-term lambs (137-147 days) delivered by C-section, paralyzed and ventilated with 100% o 2 . Cardiac output and DA flow were measured by radioactive microspheres. PGE 2 concentrations (PA= 64\u00b122, Ao=69\u00b131 pg/ml) and the DA resistance (1892\u00b1733 torr/l/ min/kg) stabilized by 2 hr after delivery. We then started a continuous PGEz infusion into the superior vena cava; PGEz concentrations and DA resistances were measured 20 minutes after each increase in rate (.005 to .133 ug/kg/min PGEz). We observed the first significant persistent decrease in DA resistance (889\u00b1493 torr/l/min/kg) at PGE 2 concentrations of PA=l93\u00b133 and Ao=84\u00b115 pg/ml. At the maximum PGE 2 concentrations obtained in each animal (PA=635tl95, Ao=l05tpg/ml) the DA resistance was even lower (468\u00b1288 torr/l/min/kg). The PGEz infusions had no significant effect on systemic or pulmonary vascular resistances. We conclude that elevated plasma PGEz concentrations found in n1\u00b7wborn lambs with PDA may be responsible for the DA patency after delivery. Elective cesarean section (C/S) has been increasing over the last decade. This study was performed to determine if respiratory morbidity (RM) is different if labor has occurred.",

Of these, 196 were free of significant maternal and fetal illness. C/S was performed in 111 after the onset of labor and in 85 without labor.RM defined as >15minutes o 2 requirement after admission to the nursery, occurred with greater frequency in the no-labor group (p<.001), as indicated in the table below which also gives the incidence of RM by gestational age (GA) on postnatal examination.

In the study group RM>4hrs occurred in l.8%(L) vs 9.4% (NL, p<.001). The average cost of hospitalization for NL patients was also excessive being 3 times that of study infants without RM and 1.5 times the cost for L group patients with RM.RM was greater in neonates born by non-emergent C/S without labor. Awaiting the onset of labor may significantly reduce RM in neonates delivered by non-emergent C/S. Erythroid cell lines are a major heme source in the newborn. The most important humoral for erythropoiesis is erythropoiet in (Ep). Elevated Ep levels have been noted in the cord blood of hyperinsulinemic rhesus monkey fetuses, infants of diabetic mothers (IDM), and hypoxic neonates. Evidence of stimulated erythropoiesis also has been found in each of these instances. Therefore increased heme catabolism in IDM may be related to stimulated erythropoiesis. We studied 6 IDll, 7 infants who were large for dates (LGA), and 6 infants who were appropriately grown for their gestational age (AGA); they were delivered 36 weeks gestation, and had a mean birthweight of 3.70 \u00b1 .53 (SD) kg (range 2.32-4.37 kg). Cord blood samples were analyzed for Ep levels. The pulmonary excretion rate of carbon monoxide (Ver,o), a valid means of determining the bilirubin production rate, was measured in the first few days of life, and found to have a positive linear correlation with Ep (n=l9, p<.02). The two infants with the highest Veco resl!lts also had the highest Ep values, and were both InY. These data suggest that increased erythropoiesis, effective or ineffective, mediated by Ep, may be a significant factor in the hyperbilirubinemia seen in certain neonatal populations such as IDM and Lr.A infants. Postrotatory nystagmus is an easily elicited reflex reported to be abnormal in developmentally delayed children. PR-N has been recorded in newborns, but methodological difficulties have compromised its full understanding. Eight healthy adults were compared with 19 full-term and 13 prematures, all neurologically normal, tested at 2,6,9, and 12 months. All subjects were positioned in a rotational chair, spun for 1 minute at a constant angular velocity (150\u00b0/sec) and then abruptly stopped. Electronic recording of PR-N in absolute darkness continued for 5 min. Two types of PR-N were observed. Primary PR-N consisted of an average of 80 eye movements (beats) lasting 40 sec., in direction opposite to the rotation and was followed by Secondary PR-N (mean of 130 beats, 200 seconds duration, same direction as the original rotation). ANOVA and Scheffe's method of post hoc multiple comparisons were used. Results for full term and prematures were similar in all recorded variables, hence the entire group of infants was compared to adults. The number and frequency of beats in both Primary and Secondary PR-N were significantly greater in adults. However, the angular displacement, duration and velocity of each beat was significantly higher in infants of all ages. All components of PR-N, whether Primary or Secondary, can be recorded and identified under 1 year of age and are significantly different from that obtained from adults. These differences may reflect anatomical and neurophysiological immaturity of eye control in the infant. Hypoglycemia has been reported in infants whose aortic catheter (UAC) was placed above the celiac axis. It was postulated that hypoglycemia resulted from direct infusion of glucose into the pancreas stimulating the beta cell. To evaluate this hypothesis, 9 term lambs [birthweight 5.2\u00b10.3 kg (M\u00b1SEM); age 4.8\u00b10.6 days] were infused with 6 mg/kg/min of dextrose into a UAC below the celiac axis for 2 hrs following which 25 \u00b5Ci/kg D-[6-3H) glucose was given by the prime constant infusion technique to measure Ra. After a recovery period of 1 hr, the study was repeated with dextrose infusion above the celiac axis. Blood was drawn for pl. glucose, insulin and glucose specific activity from the carotid artery and Ra was calculated.",

In order to assess the contributions of altitudeinduced polycythemia and impaired conjugation and excretion of bilirubin to this problem, rats kept at a simulated altitude of 4600 m for 6 weeks were given loading doses (0.5, 1.5, and 3.0 mg/100 g) of bilirubin and hematocrit, hemoglobin, total and unconjugated bilirubin determined on samples taken 17 min. later. Hematocrit rose from 42.5% to 67.2% and hemoglobin rose from 14.6 to 20.9 g/dl with exposure to simulated altitude and contribute to the significant (p<.05) increase in serum bilirubin in rats given no exogenous bilirubin. However, the loading dose conditions indicate that an impairment in conjugation, but not excretion, also contribute to the altitude effect: at every dose, the high altitude rats had significantly higher total serum bilirubin levels than sea-level rats, due entirely to a rise in unconjugated bilirubin as conjugated bilirubin levels were significantly reduced in high-altitude rats at all doses. Impaired excretion would have led to increased rather than decreased conjugated bilirubin in the serum.We conclude that both polycythemia and an impairment in bilirubin conjugation, but not in excretion, occur at high altitude. Effects of mechanical ventilation upon pulmonary dynamics of the premature newborn lung were studied during the 1st week of life for 13 infants. Dynamic compliance (CL) and lung resistance (RL) were determined for spontaneous and mechanical breaths of pressure-cycled intermittent mandatory ventilation using a multichannel recorder with scalar and loop output. Volume-pressure and pressure-flow loops were measured by planimetry (mm2/g) to determine compliance loop-area (CL/area) and resistance loop area (RL/ area). Seven infants (13llg \u00b1 62) recovered from respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and were extubated on day 13(!3).Six infants (1178g \u00b1 95) developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) by week 3 of life and required mechanical ventilation until day 56(\u00b112). During the 1st week of mechanical ventilation, mean airway pressure for both groups decreased progressively from 10.4 to 6.3 cmH20 (r=0.932). Mechanical vs spontaneous breath CL/areas for RDS patients on day 7 were 2.40 vs 0.45 (p=0.001) and for BPD patients were l. 62 vs 0. 52 ( p=O. 003). RLf areas of mechanical breaths for BPD patients on day 7 were 6 times greater than spontaneous breaths (8.42 vs 1.17; p=0.02). We conclude: 1) CL/areas revealed that excessive mechanical volumes and pressures were maintained, despite conventional ventilator settings and changes, 2) RL/areas increased during the 1st week for infants susceptible to BPD, and 3) respiratory loop-area analyses may identify degrees of barotrauma to be avoided. We conclude that maintaining Tab at 36.0 C. 1) decreased the frequency of pauses )2 and >5 sec in the RW. 2) did not alter the frequency of pauses >10 sec. 3) decreased the %AP and % PB in the RW, and 4) increased V02. We speculate that the reduction in the frequency of short pauses ((10 sec) associated with PB during even mild cooling may reflect the effect of an increased metabolic rate, Angiotensin converting enzyme activity in the fetus is modulated by Pao 2 and enzyme activity increases 3-fold with elevation in Pao 2 from fetal to neonatal values. Because of the synergism between angiotensin II (All) and catecholamines (CATS), we hypothesized that both play a role in the systemic circulatory adjustments with oxygenation at birth. Six unanesthetized lambs, chronically instrumented in utero, were delivered by C-Section near term and ventilated insure an unasphyxiated birth.",

Simultaneously we determined systemic va3cular resistance (SVR, mmllg/L/min) and blood flow distribution postnatally (PN). Seven children with recurrent gross or microscopic hematuria were studied. All have normal blood pressure, growth, and renal function; none has proteinuria. All of these children have decreased serum levels of C4 as measured by a functional (hemolytic) assay. When determined immunochemically, however, their C4's are within the normal range. The ratios of their hemolytic to antigenic C4's (\"hemolytic efficiency\") average .36 + .15 (range .16 to .56). The values for hemolytic efficiency in 18 normal patients average 1.01 + .26 (range .7 to 1.6).

The patients' C4 molecules are identical to those of normal serum with respect to charge, mobility, and antigenic configuration as determined by double immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis. When incubated with normal serum, the patients' sera do not decrease the C4 titer as would be the case in the presence of a nonspecific inactivator of C4 or an excessive concentration of C4 binding protein. Finally, incubation of the patients' sera with a preformed immune complex made at equivalence leads to complete C3 and C4 consumption suggesting that the abnormal C4 is able to help form a stable and efficient classical pathway C3 convertase. These data suggest either a genetic cause for this abnormality or excessive production of pro-C4 as an underlying defect.

Characteristics and pathogenetic significance of the circulating factor(s) involved have not been established. To assess specificity of this growth inhibition for lymphocytes, we studied the effect of INS sera on HF. Sera were obtained from 5 children (Y. age: 13 yrs; range 10-16 yrs) with INS (MCNS 2, FSS 2, and membranous GN I) in relapse (protein-uria> lg/m2/day). All patients had hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia and normal creatinine clearance; when studied, none were receiving prednisone. Sera were incubated with an HF primary cell line derived from foreskin or skin biopsy. Control medium containing F-12 + FCS was compared to F-12 + FCS + human normal or nephrotic sera at 5, 10 or 20% concentration; HF growth was followed for 8 days. Nephrotic sera produced a 2-8 fold increase of HF growth. Cell counts: normal sera x 94,800 \u00b1 21,407 SEM;INS sera x 500,700 + 153,000 SEM (p < 0.001).

Hsia, Michael Freundlich, Helen Gorman, and Jose Strauss, Univ. of Miami School of Medicine, Depts. of Peds. and Biochem., Miami, Florida.Hyperlipidemia (HL) is common during relapse in MCNS. This study assessed severity and duration of HL in MCNS children during relapse and remission as compared with age matched controls (Morrison, J. et al.: Pediatrics 62:990, 1978) . Serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low density lipoproteins (LDL), and high density lipoproteins (HDL) were measured in 39 MCNS children; 22 were in relapse (proteinuria > I g/m2/day) and 17 were in remission (no proteinuria for> 3 mos, x: 2 yrs). Results are expressed in mg/dl (x \u00b1 SD; * p: < 0.01) and age in yrs (x and range).GROUP AGE TC TG LDL HDL MCNS, relapse 9 (2-17) 361\u00b1131* 258+188* 238\u00b171* 62\u00b118 MCNS, remission 10 (4-20) 223\u00b1 77* !Oo\u00b1 52* 160\u00b179* 59\u00b117 Control 10 (6-17) 160\u00b1 25 55\u00b1 21 95\u00b124 56\u00b111 LDL/HDL ratios> 2 (normal 1.6-2.0 for ages studied) were observed in 88% of children in relapse and 58% in remission. Duration of lipid changes in remission correlated well with duration of disease and frequency of relapse. Lipid changes in MCNS may last for prolonged periods of time and arc frequently associated with abnormal LDL/HDL ratios. This study suggests that MCNS children need lipid evaluation at regular intervals, and follow-up even in remission. Further data should clarify the pathogenesis of persistent HL in MCNS children and its role as a risk factor for premature coronary atherosclerosis. Factors associated with alteration in systemic vascular pressure (volume expansion, pneumothorax, etc.) have been associated with intracranial hemorrhage in ill preterm infants and seem to implicate deficient regulation of cerebral blood flow in the etiopathogenesis of SEH/IVH. We have been involved in a prospective study using range gated pulsed Doppler ultrasound to determine carotid and anterior cerebral flow characteristics in ill preterm infants. Serial studies are performed on each infant, and response of cerebral flow to changes in mean arterial pressure is assessed. Thus far, 9 infants have been studied. Five infants demonstrated increased (decreased) cerebral flow velocity in response to increased (decreased) mean arterial pressure and had intracranial hemorrhage. SEH/IVH occurred prior to velocity studies in 4 of the 5 infants. Four infants demonstrated no change in cerebral flow velocity with change in mean arterial pressure, and none of these bled.",

            "text": "In conclusion: (1) Cerebral blood flow velocity alterations as a response to changes in mean arterial pressure appear related to intracranial hemorrhage in the ill preterm infant. (2) Some ill preterm infants can effectively regulate cerebral blood flow. Ligation of the right common carotid (LRCC) for venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) is always of concern, although no neurologic deficit has been shown to occur from this procedure. We did Doppler studies to measure ACA pulsatilit) indexes (Pis) in 3 infants who had LRCC, to try to detect changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF).One infant had ACA Pis measured before LRCC, and her left and right Pis were equal then. 2.5 hours following LRCC the Pis were unequal, with the R PI 0.75 and the LPI 0.62. Two months later the difference persisted, with the R PI 0.76 and the L ri 0.52. Another infant had ACA Pis measured 5.5 mos. following LRCC, with the R PI 0. 76 and L PI 0.69. Both infants had CBF and brain scans showing normal and equal perfusion of cerebral hemispheres, without cerebral infarct. Both infants are developing normally.A third infant had an IVH a few hours after going on VA ECMO. ACA Pis done after the IVH were R PI 0.81 and L PI 0.73. This infant did not survive. U lly factors determining cerebral blood flow velocities (as measured by ACA Pis) have equal effects bilaterally. An example is asphyxia causing cerebral vasodilation and lowering of the Pis. After LRCC, left sided CBF must also supply the right brain. This increase in the vascular bed of the left internal carotid is reflected in the L ACA by lowering of the L PI with respect to the R PI. From l/78 to 6/81 21 infants developed Hydrocephalus :! 0 to IVH documented by ultrasound or computerized axial tomography (CAT), mean birth weight 1223gms. Eighteen survived. HD was classified: mild 5 (1 exp.) moderate 2(1 lost to follow-up) severe 14(2 exp.) Supportive treatment (Rx) was given as necessary. Mild and moderate HD didn't receive specific Rx. Rx of severe HD: 4 had repeated lumbar taps (RLT),9 had RLT+ventriculo-peritoneal shunt (VPS) 1 had no specific Rx (clinically well, CAT unchanged.)Seventeen infants were followed between 6 mos.-2 yrs. with CAT scans, neurologic, hearing, vision and Denver Development2.l screening test (DDST) corrected for gestational age. 5/5 with mild or moderate HD had normal DDST,2/5 had mild t reflexes. CAT showed no change in 4, improvement 1. Twelve infants with severe HD showed: Mild t of reflexes were DDST-delay/mos. RLT(3} RLT+VPS (8) The majority of studies of neonatal breathing patterns have involved wave shape analysis in the time domain. These include determination tidal volume, insp. time/exp. time, and respiratory rate (RR). Because currently used ventilatory parameters do not differentiate complex breathing patterns, a more critical wave shape analysis technique may be required. Power density spectral analysis provides a quantitative method for expressing a given wave shape as a function of its frequency components. Spectral analysis of breathing patterns was evaluated in 5 spontaneously breathing infants, mean study wt. 1.8 .!. 0.1 kg and study age of 35 .!. 17 days. Infants were breathing room air through a face mask which was attached to a pneumotachograph to measure air flow and this signal was integrated into volume. Data was digitized and recorded on flexible disk and analyzed by HP 9845B computer. Power spectral density was used to evaluate breathing patterns for frequency range, peak frequency (fp) and centroid frequency (fc>\u00b7 Respiratory spectrum bandwidth was 50 to 202 breaths/min. (0.8 -3.4 Hz). Mean .!. SE of fp = 66.5 .!. 2.2 b/min., fc = 68.9 .!. 1.1 b/min. Resp. rate 70 .!. 4 b/min. There was a significant correlation between fp and RR. It appears that power spectral analysis provides a quantitative technique for evaluating breathing patterns. Of all various power and frequency parameters, fp and fc were most stable and reproducible. The applicability of high frequency ventilation (HFOV) in patients with dittuse alveolar disease is based on the assumption that pulmonary baroinjury will be less likely. We explored the relationship between proximal and distal airway pressures during HFOV in ten mongrel dogs with normal or oleic acid injured lungs. Distal airway pressure was measured through catheters of known frequency response inserted retrograde and wedged in the distal bronchi. Alveolar mean pressures were estimated atter equilibration following tracheal occlusion. Both pneumatic and mechanical oscillators were used with trequencies between 2 and 16 Hz and varying I:E ratios. In most animals studied, distal mean airway pressures and mean alveolar pressures were not signiticantly lower than proximal mean pressures regardless at trequency. distal pressureswere significantly lower at the higher frequencies (over 5 Hz) but when extremely high proximal airway pressures were required to maintain oxygenation, the distal pressures were signiticant. Prolongation at the I:E ratio or maintenance of distending pressure by use of a restrictive orifice resulted in circumstances where distal peak and mean pressures were higher than those at the proximal airway.The assumption that HFOV necessarily exposes the distal airway to lower pressures is not supported by this data. Distal pressure transmission during HFOV is dependent on the I:E ratio, trequency, oscillatory volume, and physical characteristics ot the lung.",
