Rigorous qualitative analysis of the model show that it has a globally-stable disease-free equilibrium whenever a certain epidemiological threshold, known as the effective reproduction number (R eff ), is less than unity. The model has an endemic equilibrium whenever R eff > 1. The endemic equilibrium is shown to be locally-asymptotically stable for a special case. Numerical simulations of the model show that the use of the combined testing and treatment strategy is more effective than the use of the standard ELISA testing method with ARV treatment, even for the use of condoms as a singular strategy. Furthermore, the universal strategy (which involves the use of condoms, the two testing methods and ARV treatment) is always more effective than the combined use of the standard ELISA testing method and ARVs.",

In addition to being a serious public health menace, HIV/AIDS has far reaching consequences to all social and economic sectors of society. It exacerbates poverty, reduces educational opportunities, devastates the workforce, creates large numbers of orphans, and exerts tremendous pressure on already limited health and social services [2, 9, 14, 36, 39, 43, 44] . Another more troubling aspect of HIV disease is the fact that a sizable proportion (about 25% in North America) of those infected with the virus are not aware of their HIV status [6, 25] . Thus, these individuals continue to unknowingly transmit the virus to others (in addition to not being able to benefit from clinical care to reduce morbidity and mortality).",

These notably include the staged-progression aspect, where a typical HIV-infected individual passes through several infection stages, being highly infectious during the pre-antibody phase (characterized by high viremia with over 10 million viral copies per ml), maintaining low infectivity during the asymptomatic phase and becoming highly infectious as s/he progresses toward AIDS (i.e., the AIDS stage of HIV infection) [10, 13, 15, 16, 18, 22, 26, 30] . These stages are sometimes categorized into four groups namely, acute sero-conversion stage (less than 28 days of infection), early infection stage (less than 170 days of infection but prior to development of symptoms), established infection stage (after 170 days of infection) and the AIDS stage (characterized by the presence of clinical symptoms of AIDS and very reduced level of CD4 count) [1] . Another important aspect of HIV disease is the fact that HIV RNA levels are positively correlated with infectiousness [28, 34] .",

The average transmission rate per coital act during the primary infection stage (i.e, less than 28 days of infection) is estimated to be 0.0082 [42] . Assuming that an infected individual in this stage of infection has an average of six sexual acts per month, it follows that the transmission rate in the primary infection stage is \u03b2 = 0.0082 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 12 = 0.59 per year. For the second stage of infection (i.e., 28-170 days of infection), it is assumed that the average transmission rate per coital act is 0.0035. This gives a transmission rate of \u03b2 = 0.252 per year (so that, \u03b7 2 = 0.43). For the third stage of HIV infection (i.e., from 170 days of infection to the onset of clinical symptoms of AIDS), the transmission rate per act is 0.007 [42] , so that (by using an average of 3 acts per month) \u03b2 = 0.0252 per year (hence, \u03b7 3 = 0.043). Finally, following [42] , the per coital transmission probability in the AIDS stage is assumed to be 0.0028. Using an estimate of 3 acts per month, it follows that the transmission rate in this stage is \u03b2 = 0.1 per year (thus, \u03b7 4 = 0.17). It should be mentioned that, in the above, it is assumed that individuals in the pre-AIDS and AIDS stages have reduced number of sexual acts in comparison to those in the primary and early infection stages (the justification for this assumption is that individuals in the pre-AIDS and AIDS stages are too sick to engage in active sexual activity). In summary, these estimates (for",

The transmission rate then increases to \u03b2 = 0.1 in the AIDS stage. These estimates are consistent with the conclusions drawn in numerous HIV modelling studies, such as those reported in [19, 42] (it should, however, be mentioned that some studies, such as that reported in [35] , show that HIV transmission rate is the highest during the AIDS stage of infection).",

Marks et al. [24, 25] estimated that knowledge of HIV status resulted in 57% reduction in unprotected sex (so that, r 0.43). Condom use is modelled in terms of reduction in the infection rate, \u03bb, by a factor of (1 \u2212 c \u03ba), where 0 < c < 1 is the condom efficacy and 0 < \u03ba < 1 is the fraction of sexually-active individuals that use condoms consistently and correctly (condom compliance). It is assumed that newly-infected individuals are unaware of their infection status until they are detected either by NAAT or the standard antibody test. It is assumed that individuals unaware of their infection status progress from the acute sero-conversion stage (I u 1 ) to the asymptomatic stage (I u 2 ), at a rate \u03c3 1 . Progression from the asymptomatic stage (I u 2 ) to the pre-AIDS stage (I u 3 ) occurs at a rate \u03c3 2 . Finally, pre-AIDS individuals progress to the AIDS stage at a rate \u03c3 3 . Individuals that are unaware of their infection status in the I u 1 class are tested (using NAAT) at a rate \u03c4 n , with efficacy n (0 < n < 1). Those that are positively diagnosed move to the corresponding I k 1 class. Standard (ELISA) testing is used for individuals in the I u 2 , I u 3 and A u classes at a rate \u03c4 , with efficacy (0 < < 1); and those positively identified move to their corresponding I k class. Individuals aware of their infection status progress through the various infection stages at the same rate (\u03c3 i ; i = 1, 2, 3) as those who are not (in other words, it is assumed that knowledge of HIV infection status does not alter the progression rate among untreated infected individuals).",

It is assumed, for mathematical tractability, that these (treated) individuals do not transmit infection. Further, natural mortality occurs in all epidemiological classes at a rate \u03bc (i.e., 1/\u03bc represents the average duration of acquisition of sexual partners), and individuals in the AIDS stage suffer an additional disease-induced death (at rates \u03b4 u and \u03b4 k , for individuals unaware or aware of their status, respectively).

Since the period for the acute sero-conversion stage (I 1 ) is less than 28 days of infection [1] , the average duration in this stage is set at 1 \u03c3 1 = 4 52 (so that, \u03c3 1 = 13 per year). Similarly, the average duration in the second infection stage (I 2 ) is approximately 20 weeks (28-170 days [1] ). Thus, 1 \u03c3 2 = 20 52 (so that, \u03c3 2 = 2.6 per year). The duration in the third (I 3 ) stage is assumed to be 15 years [1] (thus, \u03c3 3 = 1 15 per year).
