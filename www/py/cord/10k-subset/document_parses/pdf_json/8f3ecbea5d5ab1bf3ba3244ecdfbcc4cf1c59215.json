On the Thai-Myanmar border, all pregnant women are followed systematically with active weekly malaria screening. Over a 27-year period of providing antenatal care, 48,983 have been prospectively followed until pregnancy outcome (miscarriage or delivery) and 4,298 women have had P. vivax detected at least once. Reported here is the first known P. vivax-associated death amongst these women. The initial patient presentation was of uncomplicated P. vivax (0.5% parasitaemia) in a term, multigravida woman who responded rapidly to oral artesunate and mefloquine treatment, clearing her blood stage parasites within 48 hours. The patient appeared well, was ambulatory and due to be discharged but became unwell with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring ventilation three days (67 hours) into treatment. Despite induction and delivery of a stillborn foetus, ventilatory requirements increased and the patient died on day 7. The patient had a low body mass index. Sensitive detection with nested PCR confirmed only the presence of P. vivax species and concomitant infections such as tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were also ruled out. The contemporaneous treatment of acute uncomplicated P. vivax and the onset of ARDS on day 3 in this patient implies a possible but unconfirmed association with death in this patient. Assuming this death was caused by P. vivax, the risk of ARDS-related maternal mortality in this setting did not differ significantly between Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax (0.24 per 1,000 (1/4,158) versus 0.23 per 1,000 (1/4,298), contrary to the increased risk of maternal mortality from P. falciparum compared to P. vivax, 2.89 per 1,000 (12/4,158) versus 0.23 per 1,000 (1/4,298), P = 0.003.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "On the Thai-Myanmar border Plasmodium falciparum [1] and Plasmodium vivax [2] malaria are associated with adverse outcomes in pregnancy, with P. falciparum species typically involved in mortality reports [3] . Tests of lung function in both uncomplicated P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria have demonstrated a decrease in diffusion capacity which has been attributed to a reduction in the pulmonary capillary vascular component of gas transfer [4] . Following treatment, gas transfer is progressively reduced due to interstitial and alveolar oedema and is more prominent in P. vivax compared with P. falciparum infection. Sequestration of P. vivax in human lung tissue has not yet been shown, suggesting non-sequestering mechanisms for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), such as soluble mediators causing endothelial damage, hypoxia and systemic shock, resulting in diffuse alveolar-capillary damage [5, 6] .

In non-pregnant adults, P. vivax-associated ARDS typically occurs after parasitaemia has declined on day 2 or 3 and a review of published case reports indicate that rapid intubation and ventilation are important for survival and cases that have survived were not pregnant (91.7% (22/24)) [5, 14] . In a broad review of the clinical spectrum or P. vivax, ARDS as a single complication has been reported in low numbers over the last 20 years, mainly from high income, nonendemic countries with a low case fatality rate. This is contrary to much higher rates (case fatality rate of 50-67%) from more recent reports from endemic countries of severe vivax with ARDS occurring as part of multiple organ dysfunction/failure [15] . The risk of ARDS in relation to uncomplicated P. vivax has not been quantified, while for P. falciparum it has been estimated to be 0.1% (three in 3,300) US Army soldiers in Vietnam [16] . Systematic malaria screening (and treatment when positive) of all pregnant women at weekly antenatal consultations was introduced in 1986 at SMRU to reduce P. falciparum malaria-related maternal mortality [3] which was estimated at 1% of all pregnant women annually [2] . Since then and until the patient in this case died, there were 48,983 prospectively followed pregnancies with a known outcome (birth or miscarriage) and 12 P. falciparum and one P .vivax (the case in point) related maternal deaths, with each species accounting for one ARDS death. Amongst this cohort of pregnant women, malaria screening detected at least one episode of P. falciparum or P. vivax in 4,158 and 4,298 women, respectively. Assuming the case in point was caused by P. vivax the comparative rates of malaria-related mortality were: P. falciparum 2.89 per 1,000 (12/4,158) and P. vivax 0.23 per 1,000 (1/4,298), P = 0.003; whereas the ARDS-related malaria mortality was not significantly different for P. falciparum 0.24 per 1,000 (1/4,158) and for P. vivax and 0.23 per 1,000 (1/ 4,298) P = 1.000.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 86, "end": 89, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 105, "end": 108, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 109, "end": 112, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 306, "end": 310, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 476, "end": 480, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 833, "end": 836, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 837, "end": 840, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1262, "end": 1266, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1451, "end": 1455, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1663, "end": 1666, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1724, "end": 1727, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2303, "end": 2313, "text": "(12/4,158)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome, malaria and pregnancy"}, {"text": "Reviews of cases suggest P. vivax-associated ARDS is mostly reported to occur after the start of anti-malarial treatment and potentially more cases will be seen with the spread of chloroquine-resistance and use of alternative regimens without the same anti-inflammatory drug properties [15] .
