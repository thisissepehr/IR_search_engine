            "text": "Acute diarrhoea continues to be one of the most common illnesses in infants and young children, especially in low-income settings. Approximately half a million children continue to die annually as a result of acute diarrhoeal episodes [1] , mostly in sub-Saharan Africa or southeast Asia. The current World Health Organization (WHO) recommended management guidelines for acute diarrhoea (rehydration, supplemental zinc, feeding advice and appropriate follow-up) [2] have contributed to significant reductions in diarrhoea-associated mortality [3] . These guidelines do not suggest a role for antibiotics except in case of bloody diarrhoea (as a proxy for shigella or other invasive bacterial infections) or suspected cholera.",

            "text": "Data from the large Global Enteric Multicentre Study (GEMS) [4] show that at least one putative pathogen can be identified in over 80% of children presenting with moderate-severe diarrhoea. Similar results were also seen with a more recent molecular re-analysis of stool samples from children from low-income settings which identified a putative pathogen in 65% of children [5] . A bacterial aetiology was identified in a quarter of all stool samples studied. The recent global burden of disease study on childhood diarrhoea indicates that, while rotavirus is the leading cause of diarrhoea-related deaths (28%) in young children, bacterial species including Shigella spp. (14.5%), non-typhoid Salmonella spp. (8.4%), Campylobacter spp. (9%) and Escherichia coli (6.5%) also contribute to a significant number of deaths in this age group [1] . These studies suggest a significant role for bacterial pathogens in diarrhoea-associated deaths [1] . Other studies have also demonstrated that visible blood in the stool is a poor indicator of a bacterial aetiology in children with diarrhoea [6, 7] , suggesting that the use of blood in the stool as a proxy for Shigella spp. may be inadequate and that the indications for antibiotic use in young children with acute diarrhoea could be expanded.",

Azithromycin, a macrolide with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity and immunomodulatory properties, has been administered to children in the context of mass drug administration programmes largely for trachoma prevention [10] . Observations of mortality sparing related to azithromycin administration in these trachoma interventions prompted several large community trials of azithromycin administered via mass drug administration which have shown significant mortality reductions in children in low-resource settings [11] [12] [13] .",

A recently concluded cluster randomised trial of mass drug administration of azithromycin has shown a reduction in all-cause mortality among children [11] [12] [13] . However, the effect appeared limited to a single site in this trial. Another large trial of azithromycin in addition to seasonal malaria chemoprophylaxis [21] has not documented any benefit on mortality, although a reduction in gastrointestinal infections was seen. The potential effect of azithromycin on mortality in children with a high risk of a diarrhoea-related death has not been studied to date. Young children who are undernourished or have dehydrating diarrhoea are at higher risk of death in the 3-month period after the onset of diarrhoea [4] . More recently, global data suggest that multiple bacterial and parasitic diarrhoeal pathogens are significantly associated with death, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa [1] . In low -resource settings, the high burden of bacterial causes of diarrhoea [1, 3, 5] has led to suggestions that antibiotics be used more widely, even in the absence of dysentery, as most children with these infections do not have bloody stools [6, 7] .",

This overuse of antibiotics contributes to the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance, both at individual and population levels. While concerns have been raised about expanding the use of empiric antibiotic treatment for diarrhoea, targeting such treatment to a specific sub-group of vulnerable children at high risk of death may potentially lower antimicrobial resistance if prescribers perceive that specific sub-groups of children at the highest risk are being targeted with antibiotic treatment. Prior studies in pneumonia have documented reduced antibiotic use when guidelines were updated to clarify which risk groups should be treated [23] . The ABCD trial will determine if providing azithromycin to children with acute diarrhoea who are at risk reduces mortality and/or diarrhoea-related morbidity, including linear growth faltering. These data will inform the global debate regarding the potential role of antibiotics in reducing child mortality.",
