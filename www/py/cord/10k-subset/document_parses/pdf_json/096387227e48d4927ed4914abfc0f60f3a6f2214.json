            "text": "The vaccine elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 is a long-sought goal. We previously reported the amino-terminal eight residues of the HIV-1-fusion peptide (FP8) -when conjugated to the carrier protein, keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) -to be capable of inducing broadly neutralizing responses against HIV-1 in animal models. However, KLH is a multi-subunit particle derived from a natural source, and its manufacture as a clinical product remains a challenge. Here we report the preclinical development of recombinant tetanus toxoid heavy chain fragment (rTTHC) linked to FP8 (FP8-rTTHC) as a suitable FP-conjugate vaccine immunogen. We assessed 16 conjugates, made by coupling the 4 most prevalent FP8 sequences with 4 carrier proteins: the aforementioned KLH and rttHc; the H. influenzae protein D (HiD); and the cross-reactive material from diphtheria toxin (CRM197). While each of the 16 FP8-carrier conjugates could elicit HIV-1-neutralizing responses, rTTHC conjugates induced higher FP-directed responses overall. A Sulfo-SIAB linker yielded superior results over an SM(PEG)2 linker but combinations of carriers, conjugation ratio of peptide to carrier, or choice of adjuvant (Adjuplex or Alum) did not significantly impact elicited FP-directed neutralizing responses in mice. Overall, SIAB-linked FP8-rTTHC appears to be a promising vaccine candidate for advancing to clinical assessment.",

            "text": "The fusion peptide (FP) site of vulnerability on the HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoprotein has recently been shown to be a promising vaccine target 1-3 . FP, a hydrophobic region of ~15 residues at the N terminus of the gp41 transmembrane glycoprotein, is an essential component of the HIV entry machinery 4 . FP embeds in the target cell membrane during the pre-hairpin intermediate stage of entry, where it serves to anchor the rearranging viral spike and to facilitate the merging of viral and cell membranes. The N-terminal portion of FP is solvent accessible and recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies PGT151 5,6 , N123-VRC34.01 3 , and ACS202 7 . Because FP is a short linear peptide, it has low inherent immunogenicity due to its lack of helper T cell epitopes. Coupling peptides to highly immunogenic carrier proteins is a well-established approach for providing T cell help to peptide immunogens [8] [9] [10] [11] . When the N-terminal 6-10 residues of FP are coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), a standard protein carrier widely used in biotechnology, the resultant FP-KLH conjugate immunogens are able to induce broadly neutralizing FP-directed immune responses in mice, guinea pigs, and rhesus macaques 1,2,12 . Vaccine-induced FP-directed antibodies from mice or NHP neutralize up to 31% or 59%, respectively, of a cross-clade panel of 208 HIV-1 strains 2 .",

However, KLH is a multi-subunit metalloprotein derived from natural sources 13-15 with both sequence and glycan heterogeneity, which pose manufacturing challenges to characterization and quality control. Moreover, native KLH is composed of subunit isoforms that assemble into a higher molecular weight form of ~8 MDa, which complicates standard manufacturing methods of filtration used for viral clearance.

A truncated, heavy chain-only, recombinant version of TT (rTTHC) has been developed as a clinically suitable carrier protein 28-31 , and a variant of diphtheria toxin from Corynebacterium diphtheriae C7 (\u03b2197) cultures has been developed (CRM197), which maintains T-helper epitopes and eliminates enzymatic activity and toxicity through a single glycine to glutamate substitution 32 .

Previously 1,2,12 as well as with the initial 16 FP-carrier conjugates tested, we used MBS 42 , a relatively hydrophobic linker of ~8 \u00c5, to couple FP with carrier protein. Although one of the most widely used heterobifunctional linkers, MBS can cause skin and respiratory irritation and has been deemed hazardous for clinical assessment. We therefore evaluated two water soluble heterobifunctional linkers, which have been deemed GMP-suitable. These crosslinkers are sulfo succinimidyl [4-iodoacetyl] aminobenzoate and PEGylated SMCC 43, 44 (hereafter referred to as Sulfo-SIAB and SM(PEG)2) ( Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. S3f ). Although Sulfo-SIAB contains a light sensitive sulfhydryl-reactive function group, it is more stable in solution than maleimide-based crosslinkers like MBS, and equally hydrophobic. By contrast, SM(PEG)2 contains a hydrophilic spacer, and conjugates made with this linker generally have increased solubility.",

For the various peptide-carrier conjugate boosts, we coupled FP8v1 to carriers with the Sulfo-SIAB linker and tested single carriers (groups 1-3), single carriers altered sequentially (group 4), cocktails of two carriers either with rTTHC and CRM197 (group 5) or as sequentially alternating combination of two carriers (group 6), cocktails of three carriers (group 7) as well as a no carrier control group (group 8).

Different ratios of peptide-carrier, adjuvanted with Adjuplex or with Alum, can induce desired FP-directed neutralizing responses. Having selected rTTHC and Sulfo-SIAB as carrier and linker, we assessed immunogenically additional variants of FP8v1-rTTHC as monomeric as well as multimeric forms of the conjugates, with varying peptide conjugation ratio ranging from 4.8 to 11.2 FPs attached to each rTTHC ( Fig. 5a and Supplementary Figs. S4 and S5 and Table S1 ). The monomeric form of FP8v1-rTTHC had 11.2 copies of FP8 conjugated to each rTTHC, as determined by amino acid analysis, and on the multimeric forms of FP8v1-rTTHC, amino acid analysis indicate there were FP8 to rTTHC ratios of 4.8~7.2:1. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) revealed N123-VRC34.01 K D s of 70-80 nM for all forms of FP8v1-rTTHC and stoichiometries ranging between 1.9 and 3.0 for the number of antigenic-binding fragments (Fabs) of N123-VRC34.01 that could bind each FP8v1-rTTHC monomer ( Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. S4c) , suggesting that not all FP8 peptides conjugated to rTTHC were accessible for VRC34.01 binding presumably due to steric hindrance between Fabs binding to proximal FPs. BLI measurements with N123-VRC34.01 IgG indicated an apparent affinity of tighter than 1 pM, reflecting increased affinity related to avidity from each arm of the antibody binding to a separate FP. We also observed high specificity, with only FP-directed antibodies binding to the FP8v1-rTTHC conjugates ( Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. S5 ).",

Week 24 immune sera, after three Env trimer boosts, were assessed for neutralization on a panel of 10 wild-type strains, selected to encompass divergent HIV-1 clades (Fig. 5d) . Homologous neutralization against BG505 was observed only sporadically (Fig. 5d) , as was the neutralization against HIV-1 strains with non-matching FP8 sequences (Supplementary Fig. S6 ). An exception was the strain TH023.6 ( Supplementary Fig. S6 ), which has FP Thai sequence 1 with the first six residues identical to those in FPv1, suggesting that the N-terminal six residues are likely to play a more important role for FP-directed antibody recognition, especially for the recognition of this TH023.6 strain. Heterologous neutralization of viruses with matching FP8 sequences, however, was much stronger, with the majority of mice in all three groups neutralizing at least five out of nine heterologous strains (Fig. 5d ). All three groups exhibited a similar level of neutralization against heterologous strains with no statistically significant difference, suggesting that, in the mouse model, both Alum and Adjuplex were suitable as adjuvants and that multimerization of conjugate immunogens or variation of FP to carrier ratios did not substantially impact the elicitation of neutralizing responses.",

Unfortunately, the research grade FP-carrier and conjugating linker, which were tested in initial vaccine-test animal experiments, are not suitable for testing in humans. Here we identify rTTHC as a suitable carrier protein and Sulfo-SIAB as a suitable crosslinker for clinical development of FP-carrier conjugate immunogens. We further assessed the immunogenicity of a number of FP8v1-rTTHC variants and found these to elicit cross-reactive neutralizing responses, which were tolerant to variation in ratio of FP linked to each rTTHC and to the type of adjuvant used (Fig. 5) . Such tolerance suggests the elicited broad response to be primarily dependent on use of FP and carrier and to be robust to many of the specific characteristics of peptide, carrier, and their conjugation.",

            "text": "In general, immunization with peptides is a well-established technology [46] [47] [48] . In many cases, peptide immunization fails to elicit high titer-neutralizing antibody responses, because the conformationally unstructured peptide immunogens often elicit antibodies that cannot bind natively folded protein antigens 49, 50 . FP in the context of HIV Env trimer, however, is conformationally diverse, as observed in crystal and cryo-EM structures of Env trimers 5,6 , by molecular dynamics simulations of Env trimers 3 , and by diversity in the conformation of FP recognized by cross-clade neutralizing antibodies 2,51 . The inherent structural diversity of FP on the prefusion-closed Env trimer thus appears to mirror the conformational diversity of FP coupled to carrier protein, with antibodies elicited by conformationally diverse FP immunogens still able to recognize and neutralize FP in the Env trimer context. We note that the ability to elicit broad HIV-1 neutralizing responses with an established vaccine technology has multiple advantages, including the prior development and clinical assessment of multiple carrier proteins.",
