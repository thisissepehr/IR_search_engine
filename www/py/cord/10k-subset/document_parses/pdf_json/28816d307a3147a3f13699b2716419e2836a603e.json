            "text": "The repeating unit of the C. difficile Toxin A (rARU, also known as CROPS [combined repetitive oligopeptides]) C-terminal region, was shown to elicit protective immunity against C. difficile and is under consideration as a possible vaccine against this pathogen. However, expression of recombinant rARU in E. coli using the standard vaccine production process was very low. Transcriptome and proteome analyses showed that at restricted dissolved oxygen (DO) the numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was 2.5-times lower than those expressed at unrestricted oxygen. Additionally, a 7.4-times smaller number of ribosome formation genes (needed for translation) were down-regulated as compared with unrestricted DO. Higher rARU expression at restricted DO was associated with up-regulation of 24 heat shock chaperones involved in protein folding and with the up-regulation of the global regulator RNA chaperone hfq. Cellular stress response leading to down-regulation of transcription, translation, and energy generating pathways at unrestricted DO were associated with lower rARU expression. Investigation of the C. difficile DNA sequence revealed the presence of cell wall binding profiles, which based on structural similarity prediction by BLASTp, can possibly interact with cellular proteins of E. coli such as the transcriptional repressor ulaR, and the ankyrins repeat proteins. At restricted DO, rARU mRNA was 5-fold higher and the protein expression 27-fold higher compared with unrestricted DO. The report shows a strategy for improved production of C. difficile vaccine candidate in E. coli by using restricted DO growth. This strategy could improve the expression of recombinant proteins from anaerobic origin or those with cell wall binding profiles.",

            "text": "The issue of lower rARU yield could also be related to the unique sequence and the structural motifs present in the Clostridial DNA. It was recently shown that certain recombinant proteins (e.g., proteins of a different nature like soluble (xylanase and GFP) or inclusion body (Interferon \u03b2)) based on cellular localization (e.g., secreted proteins (NprE, XynA, Usp45, TEM-1 \u03b2-lactamase), membrane proteins (LmrA and XylP), or lipoproteins (MntA and YcdH)) caused different host cellular responses when overexpressed 29,30 . It is possible by using next generation sequencing tools to quantify the gene expression profile at different growth and production phases in order to identify changes related to substrate consumption, central carbon metabolism, and energy metabolism based on the sequence and structural features. Here we report that expressing C. difficile rARU from E. coli in a restricted dissolved oxygen (DO) supply condition is 27-fold higher than expression obtained when regular conditions of unrestricted DO are implemented. We hypothesized that the presence of cell wall binding profiles in the rARU is the cause. Log and late-log phase samples from cultivations at restricted and unrestricted DO were investigated by using transcriptomics and proteomics. The information obtained suggests that the cell wall binding segments of the rARU have a role in gene expression by interacting with the cellular E. coli proteins.",

Therefore, an optimized expression was established by supplying the growing culture with 2 vvm air that generated restricted DO conditions and supported ~27-fold higher rARU concentrations. The possibility that the restricted DO conditions affected the T7 promoter was ruled out since at these conditions the expression of the T7 RNA polymerase was not affected (Supplementary Figure 3) . www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Transcriptomic and proteomic response to restricted and unrestricted DO. A larger number of DEGs were down-regulated at unrestricted DO as compared with restricted DO. A total of 1618 DEGs were down-regulated at unrestricted DO and of these, 1066 were down-regulated exclusively at unrestricted DO. Particularly important is the down-regulation of the RNA polymerases (rpoB -5.67-fold, rpoC -4.46-fold, rpoZ -3.39-fold and rpoA -6.58) which are essential for transcription initiation. In contrast, except for rpoD which was down-regulated, rpoA, rpoC, and rpoZ were up-regulated at restricted DO (1.2-fold, 1.0-fold, and 1.31-fold respectively). Since the translation process depends on the availability of ribosomes, amino acids, aminoacyl tRNA, and ATP molecules, it is not surprising that the genes associated with these processes were also differentially down-regulated in the unrestricted DO. This group includes 52 DEGs related to ribosome formation, 19 related to aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis, 44 associated amino acid biosynthesis, and 17 involved in oxidative phosphorylation. The down-regulation of genes associated with energy related metabolism, central metabolism, and ribosomal RNA were previously shown to be associated with the cellular stress response (CSR) generated during recombinant protein overexpression 35, 36 . The down-regulation of the above-mentioned processes displays a behavior that supports the lower amount of rARU expressed at unrestricted DO. Previous reports showed that the presence of the rarely used codons of arginine and leucine in clostridial proteins is a possible bottleneck in their translations 18, 21, 22 . The aminoacyl tRNA genes for arginine (argS) and leucine (leuS) in late-log phase were up-regulated (f.c.1.9, and 1.67 respectively) at restricted DO condition as compared with unrestricted DO condition.",

So far, only 15 protein sequences were identified to contain a similar cell wall binding repeat profile (Supplementary Table 5 (S5b)). The Blast search showed proteins with similar structures in E. coli that potentially can bind to rARU (Supplementary Table 4 ). These were: the transcriptional repressor ulaR, the tyrosine protein kinase Wzc, the outer membrane Usher protein HtrE, ankyrin proteins (YahD and ArpA), the phosphoribosylformylglycinamide synthetase PurL, and the site-specific DNA recombinase PinE. Additional interactions with cellular proteins are possible due to the presence of the two cysteine residues in rARU, which can form disulfide bridges at high dissolved oxygen levels.",

Initially to capture the sequence feature, we fused 600 bp of rARU (with 7 cell wall binding motifs) N-terminal region to eGFP to see if this affects the protein expression. As a result, the rARU expression was higher at restricted DO. Then we tried smaller sequence size of 300 bp (with only 3 cell wall binding motifs), which gave similar results. The expression of eGFP fused to both 300 and 600 bp of rARU at the N-terminal region was higher at restricted DO. The selected 300 and 600 bp from the rARU N-terminal contained respectively 3 and 7 cell wall binding repeats (Fig. 5) , which was likely responsible for the higher expression at restricted DO. Although the mechanism behind this interaction is unknown, it is possible that the interaction of the rARU sequence with cellular proteins triggered a higher expression at restricted DO condition. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The interaction of rARU with the transcriptional repressor ulaR may influence the biosynthesis of NADH and pentoses by affecting the L-ascorbate uptake 51 . ulaR operates by interaction with L-ascorbate-6-P and by binding to the intergenic region of ulaA and ulaG and inhibition of the ulaABCDEF operon transcription. UlaR was down-regulated in the late-log phase (ulaR f.c. \u22121.03) at restricted DO, which may cause the up regulation of ulaG. As a result, ulaB, ulaD, ulaE, and ulaF of the ulaABCDEF operon remained active in the late log phase of restricted DO enabling the cells to efficiently utilize L-ascorbate and support PPP to produce NADH and pentoses.",

The \"ankyrin repeat\" containing proteins were discovered in mammalian cells and were involved in cell signaling, regulation, and structural integrity. A previous study on the overexpression of an \"ankyrin repeat\" containing protein (e.g., RNase L) caused RNA degradation and inhibition of cell growth in E. coli 28 . Interestingly, the role of \"ankyrin repeat\" proteins at signaling and regulatory levels was never explored in E. coli. A list of many other E. coli proteins which may possibly interact with rARU is provided in Supplementary Table 4 . The list includes the Wzc protein (wzc f.c. \u22121.12 at log phase and f.c. \u22121.25 at late-log phase) which is involved in making exopolysaccharide colanic acid (M-antigen) which increases E. coli's ability to survive in environmental stresses 52 .

We observed that rARU transcript accumulation was highest only when the culture was grown at a restricted DO concentration. It is very likely that this unusual expression condition is an indication that a special gene sequence and structure of the produced protein are related to the expression. Therefore, significant production was possible only by applying restricted DO growth strategy. A possible reason for this special phenomenon was the presence of cell wall binding repeats motifs that allowed transcription and translation at restricted DO and therefore increased its expression at these conditions. The role of the heterologous protein sequence in the metabolic toxicity due to overexpression of recombinant proteins was reported, but no analysis was performed to understand the functional features associated with the sequence and how it interacted with the host cellular machinery [54] [55] [56] . This report demonstrated a connection between rARU expression and restricted DO, which presents the possibility of the improved expression of other recombinant proteins of anaerobic origin or of proteins that are associated with cell wall binding repeat profiles. The implemented restricted DO expression strategy used in this work will likely improve the expression of other similar proteins in E. coli.",

Expression plasmid pRSET-B-rARU-KanR containing rARU gene under T7 promoter was transformed in the E. coli strain. The pRSET-B-rARU plasmid possesses kanamycin resistance along with entire C-terminal repeating region of toxin A (rARU) (861 amino acids plus 4 amino acids upstream) having a Molecular weight (MW) of 104 kDa 16 , along with a 6x His tag at the C-terminal. Both plasmid and strain were provided by TechLab, Inc. (Blacksburg, VA). Two fusion constructs were designed consisting of partial N-terminal regions (i.e., 300 bp and 600 bp of rARU with the eGFP). The fusion constructs were renamed as pRSET-B-300rARU + eGFP and pRSET-B-600rARU + eGFP. Samples for rARU, acetic acid, and total RNA were collected at regular intervals. After centrifugation at 14,000 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C, the supernatant was kept at \u221220 \u00b0C for glycerol and acetate analysis, and the cell pellets were quickly frozen by dry ice and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for RNA extraction.

The data was searched using protein sequences from E. coli as well as known contaminants and a list of control proteins used to monitor reaction efficiency. Default values were used but matches between runs was enabled with a 0.5 min allowable difference in elution time (which was applied after spline fitting the elution patterns).",
