The correct, controlled trafficking of these cells is an essential feature of the immune response to infection, but loss of control results in inflammatory diseases. Leukocyte recruitment is a wellorchestrated process that involves several protein families, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules, matrix metalloproteinases and the large cytokine subfamily of chemotactic cytokines, the chemokines 1-3 . Anti-inflammatory approaches that target the first three groups of proteins have been studied in vitro and tested in many animal models, and several have been used in the clinic during the past few decades [4] [5] [6] . Here, I discuss the rationale for targeting the chemokines and their receptors, and the current status of chemokine therapeutics. Chemokines Chemokines are a large family of small proteins that are distinguished from other cytokines by being the only members of the cytokine family that act on the superfamily of G-protein-coupled serpentine receptors. Although chemokines have a relatively low level of sequence identity, their three-dimensional structure shows a remarkable homology in that they all have the CHEMOKINE RECEPTORS: MULTIFACETED THERAPEUTIC TARGETS Amanda E. I. Proudfoot Chemokines and their receptors are involved in the pathogenesis of diseases ranging from asthma to AIDS. Chemokine receptors are G-protein-coupled serpentine receptors that present attractive tractable targets for the pharmaceutical industry. It is only ten years since the first chemokine receptor was discovered, and the rapidly expanding number of antagonists holds promise for new medicines to combat diseases that are currently incurable. Here, I focus on the rationale for developing antagonists of chemokine receptors for inflammatory disorders and AIDS, and the accumulating evidence that favours this strategy despite the apparent redundancy in the chemokine system. 7 . This fold, consisting of three \u03b2 strands, a carboxy (C) terminal helix and a flexible amino (N) terminal region, is conferred on these proteins by a four-cysteine motif that forms two characteristic disulphide bridges. However, as with all rules, there are exceptions in which two cysteines are lacking (as in XCL1 or Lymphotactin) or there is an extra pair (as in CCL21 or the secondary lymphoid-tissue chemokine 6Ckine/SLC). The flexible N-terminal region is believed to be important in receptor activation, because modification of this region has been shown by many laboratories to affect activity [8] [9] [10] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 755, "end": 758, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 759, "end": 762, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 763, "end": 766, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 899, "end": 909, "text": "Chemokines", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1357, "end": 1367, "text": "Chemokines", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2638, "end": 2641, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2642, "end": 2645, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2646, "end": 2650, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Newcomers to the field of chemokine biology are often daunted by the thought of searching for specific inhibitors of the chemokine system, given that 50 chemokine ligands and 19 functional receptors have been described to date -and how many might be identified now that the sequencing of the human genome is almost complete? The numbers and in vitro studies tell us that the system apparently contains redundancy. There are few receptors that bind a single ligand, and several chemokines can bind to more than one receptor (FIG. 1) .

The essential role of chemokines in the establishment of a functional immune system through their properties of basal trafficking and homing is apparent from the phenotypes of mice in which their genes have been deleted. The deletion of CXCR4 or its ligand CXCL12/SDF-1 (stromal-cell-derived factor 1) both result in an embryonic lethal phenotype 11, 12 , whereas deletion of CCR7 or its ligand CCL21/SLC results in mice that, although they are viable, lack the correct architecture of secondary lymphoid tissue 13, 14 .

Similarly, the CXC chemokines interleukin-8 (IL-8/CXCL8) 18 and interferon-inducible polypeptide 10 (IP-10/CXCL10) (originally named IP-10 owing to its molecular weight of~10 kDa) 19 were identified from stimulated monocytes. It was observed from the sequences of these chemokines that they had a highly conserved motif of four cysteines and that the N-terminal cysteine pair was either separated by a single residue, giving rise to the CXC chemokines (\u03b1 subclass), or adjacent, giving rise to the CC chemokines (\u03b2 subclass). This observation allowed the rapid cloning of new family members including CCL5 (RANTES, regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted) from activated T cells 20 . These six inducible chemokines are important factors in most inflammatory disorders, as is shown by the involvement of their receptors in the diseases summarized in FIG. 3. Excessive recruitment of leukocytes, the hallmark of inflammation, occurs in both acute and chronic inflammatory disorders. For many years, it was thought that CXC chemokines were responsible for acute inflammation, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), in which there is a massive neutrophil infiltrate in the lungs, because CXC chemokines act on these cells. CC chemokines recruit the leukocytes that mediate chronic inflammation, such as eosinophils and T cells in asthma, and monocytes/macrophages and T cells in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). The neuronal damage that leads to paralysis in MS patients is thought to be initiated by an inflammatory phase 21 in which T cells and monocytes are recruited across the blood-brain barrier (FIG. 4) . However, with the Chemokines are divided into subclasses on the basis of the spacing of the N-terminal cysteine residues. The receptors for the \u03b1 (or CXC) subclass are shown in blue, the receptors for the \u03b2 (or CC) subclass in red and the receptors for the minor subclasses (C and CX 3 C) in green. The pairing of chemokines to their receptors has been carried out mainly by receptorbinding assays. Chemokines were initially named according to their function or from the cell type that produced them, giving rise to names such as monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), stromal derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and mucosaeassociated epithelial chemokine (MEC). The simultaneous identification by different laboratories of a chemokine sequence often resulted in several names, such as MIP-3\u03b1, LARC and exodus-1. In order to eliminate the confusion, a systematic nomenclature has recently been adopted 3 . The abbreviations of the common names are as follows: BCA-1, B-cell-attracting chemokine 1; CTACK, cutaneous T-cell-attracting chemokine; ELC, Epstein-Barr-virus-induced gene 1 ligand chemokine; ENA78, epithelial-cell-derived neutrophil-activating peptide 78; GCP-2, granulocyte chemotactic protein 2; Gro, growthregulated oncogene; IL-8, interleukin 8; IP-10, interferoninducible protein 10; I-TAC, interferon-inducible T-cell \u03b1 chemoattractant; MCP, monocyte chemoattractant protein; MDC, macrophage-derived chemokine; MEC, mucosaeassociated epithelial chemokine; MIG, monokine induced by interferon \u03b3; MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein; NAP-2, neutrophil-activating peptide 2; RANTES, regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted; SDF-1, stromal-cell-derived factor 1; SLC, secondary lymphoid-tissue chemokine; TARC, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine; TECK, thymus-expressed chemokine.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 454, "end": 457, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1334, "end": 1341, "text": "FIG. 3.", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2116, "end": 2124, "text": "(FIG. 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "www.nature.com/reviews/immunol R E V I E W S has built in several levels of control that lead to specificity in vivo.

There is a known link between CCL5-induced leukocyte activation and chemotaxis to second messengers formed by the degradation of plasma-membrane-integral phospholipids by phospholiposes and their synthesis into differently phosphorylated phosphoinositides by phosphoinositide 3-kinase 23 . However, the roles of the Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK) 24 and the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways downstream of CCL5 (REF. 25) need to be further elucidated. Activation of serpentine receptors induces downmodulation (removal) of the receptors from the cell surface, which is followed either by receptor recycling via endosomes or degradation in the lysosomal compartment. Although CCL5 induces similar downregulation patterns for three of its receptors (CCR1, CCR3 and CCR5), only CCR5 recycles to attain the original cell surface receptor density after exposure to CCL5 (REF. 26 ). CCR1 does not recycle to the cell surface after downregulation induced by CCL5, whereas CCR3 is partially, but not completely, restored 27, 28 . Chemokines have a second important interaction aside from their receptors, which is with cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). This is important for the immobilization of chemokines and could have an important role in governing their local concentration. CCL5 shows a greater range of affinities than CCL2, CCL3 or CXCL8 for different members of the GAG family 29 .

It has been known for over a decade that CCL3 is an inhibitor of haematopoietic stem cell proliferation 32 , which widens the field of therapeutic interest beyond inflammation to cancer, because haematopoiesis is crucial during chemotherapy. Recently, the role of chemokines in mediating breast cancer metastasis (which requires tumour cell migration) has been elegantly shown 33 . The discovery five years ago that chemokine receptors were the second element, along with CD4, that is required for human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) to fuse and enter the host cell 34 has again even further broadened their uses as therapeutic targets. This finding has, in fact, had a huge effect on the search for small molecule inhibitors of chemokine receptors. discovery that CXCR3 is expressed on activated T cells, this separation of the chemokines into a CXC class that is responsible for acute inflammation and a CC class that is responsible for chronic inflammation, broke down. Current anti-inflammatory therapies mostly act on intracellular targets in leukocytes; that is, they act on the cells that have already been recruited. In fact, certain treatments that are at present successful at treating inflammation have an effect on the recruitment of leukocytes. A good example is the cytokine interferon-\u03b2, which, although it is not a cure, is the most effective treatment for MS at present. Although its precise mechanism of action is not fully delineated, one of its properties, at least in vitro, is that it can inhibit the migration of activated leukocytes across an endothelial layer 22 .

The most convincing evidence for target validation is still that from mice in which the gene coding for the target has been deleted and an appropriate phenotype is observed in a disease model. However, I believe that the absence of a phenotype in a certain disease model using a 'knockout' mouse should be interpreted with caution, owing to the possibility of compensation by other members of the family. Despite this, knockout mice continue to yield valuable information about the chemokine system. Gene deletion of at least five chemokines and eleven receptors has been described to date. Interestingly, as discussed above, the deletion of chemokines and receptors pivotal to basal trafficking and homing have striking phenotypes, whereas those that are inducible (and presumed to have a role in inflammatory disorders) are viable and normal, and phenotypic differences are only evident when the animals are exposed to specific inflammatory situations.

CCL3 was shown to be essential for the onset of disease symptoms, whereas CCL2 was required for relapses to occur 49 . In this disease model, neutralization of other ligands such as CXCL10 affected disease progression 50 , whereas the neutralization of CCL5 had no effect. In the animal model for asthma (allergeninduced airway inflammation in the mouse), the roles of individual chemokines have been extensively studied. Blockade of several ligands that had been identified previously from upregulation of their mRNAs was shown to be effective at reducing symptoms. Surprisingly, an anti-CCL2 antibody had a greater effect than the neutralization of the specific CCR3 ligand CCL11 (REF. 51 ). Other chemokines have also been implicated in the pathology of asthmatic inflammation in this model, in which a CCR4 ligand, CCL22, has been shown to be essential in the transit and retention of leukocytes in the lung tissue 52 . MS is an autoimmune disease associated with a T-helper type 1 phenotype. It is therefore believed that activated T cells have a crucial role. Chemokine receptors have been shown to be highly produced in brain samples from MS patients after autopsy 41, 42 . One of these receptors, CXCR3, is produced by activated T cells, so it might be responsible for the recruitment of auto-aggressive T cells. This hypothesis is further confirmed by the high level of the CXCR3 ligand CXCL10 in these lesion samples. Two CC chemokine receptors, CCR1 and CCR5, have also been observed, and these receptors are both produced on T cells and monocytes/macrophages. The accumulation of these cells is directly correlated with lesions in which demyelination occurs, followed by axonal loss, which ultimately leads to paralysis. effect of the deletion of a single ligand, which is surprising in that its receptor CCR2 is also activated by four other ligands in mice, CCL7/MCP-3, CCL8/MCP-2, CCL13/MCP-4 and MCP-5 (which, to date, has no human homologue).

The fact that the CCL3 knockout mice developed EAE in the same manner as wild-type mice illustrates the possibility of compensation in knockout mice during development. Surprisingly, there is no report of the effects of the deletion of CCL5 in mice. This might be in accordance with the lack of effects seen in several anti-CCL5-antibody studies but contrasts with the elevated levels of this chemokine in many diseases and in the antagonism of CCL5 receptors with Met-CCL5, described below.

The interaction of chemokines with cell surface GAGs is well documented 29, 74, 75 and is believed to have a role in increasing local concentrations 76 .

One of the first potent small molecules to be described in the literature was a CCR5 inhibitor, TAK779, which could block the three CCR5 ligands CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 with nanomolar potency 80 . Subsequent mapping of its binding site using a panel of CCR5 mutants showed that it was in fact a non-competitive inhibitor because it bound to a cavity near the surface formed between transmembrane helices 1, 2, 3 and 7, and not to the extracellular domains that form the ligand-binding sites 81 .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Antagonism of chemokine receptors"}, {"text": "The other question that has often been posed is whether an inhibitor should be specific or whether the transplant models.

Interfering with an essential link in the chain (CCR1 or CXCR3 in the case of organ allograft transplant) might therefore result in a total inhibition of the inflammatory process. We believe that these studies, which showed protection against inflammation by eliminating two unrelated chemokine receptors, provide the strongest validation for targeting the 'redundant' chemokine receptors as therapeutic targets for inflammatory diseases. Validation for AIDS is evident from the \u220632-CCR5 population. A question, however, remains unanswered: what will the long-term effects of such a strategy be? Although the field is still too young to answer this question, and animal model studies have yet to be designed specifically to address this issue, the \u220632-CCR5 individuals again help us by showing that the total inhibition of certain receptors is not harmful to the health of humans.

The search for new therapeutic targets using any approach depends on the adequacy of animal models to mirror human disease, and this holds equally for antagonists of the chemokine system. However, it is promising that many studies targeting the chemokine receptors have shown that inflammation can be reduced.

We now await the final proof in humans, because active orally available small molecule inhibitors of the chemokine receptors are now being developed.
