Individual exposure to infectious agents and host factors such as smoking [4, 5] and vitamin D status [6, 7] are believed to contribute to observed differences in RTI risk. In addition, the role of overweight (body mass index (BMI) = 25.0-29.9 kg/m 2 ) and in particular obesity (BMI \u2265 30 kg/m 2 ) in predisposition to RTIs is increasingly discussed [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . This growing interest is driven by the rising number of overweight and obese individuals worldwide [14] and the emerging knowledge of notable immunological imbalances in association with obesity [15] . Most of the studies targeting adults explored the association of obesity with specific RTIs and their outcomes. Thus, obesity was associated with non-allergic rhinitis [8] and influenza like-illness [9] . Moreover, two population-based studies which investigated the role of obesity as risk factor for community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the general population resulted in controversial findings [10, 11] .

Obesity belongs to one of the host risk factors for RTI and has possibly an emerging role due to the dramatically increasing prevalence of obesity worldwide. In the present study, we report on the association of obesity with individual RTIs as well as with a diary score summarising different incident RTI symptoms over a period of 18 months. Our investigation could demonstrate an association between obesity and RTIs confirming previous findings on influenza-like illness [9] , bronchitis [18] and pneumonia [10, 12] . We also saw an association between obesity and rhinitis, sinusitis and pharyngitis/laryngitis. An elevated risk for sinusitis among obese was also reported in a populationbased cohort of Danish women [13] . None of the two Danish population-based studies [12, 13] used ORs of monthly prevalence, but hazard ratios (HRs), as they could identify events on a daily basis. The HR of 1.6 [12] for the association with RTIs and the HR of 1.48 [13] for the association with URTIs are, however, of similar magnitude to the risk estimates which we observed. Mechanistically, excess adiposity might weigh down host defence as several mouse as well as human studies have suggested [19, 20] . The here observed associations were more prominent for LRTIs compared to URTIs, but evident for both, and more pronounced when considering long lasting or frequent RTIs compared to single symptoms. Based on the infection diary data, we generated a RTI diary score summing-up all ten symptoms and allowing to average per month, per whole season or over the whole period of three years. Considering the upper ten percentile of the distribution of such scores as an outcome, associations were typically stronger than when considering single symptoms, and interactions were more pronounced. Moreover, the results of the seasonal score were very similar or even stronger than those of the three-years score, arguing for the adequacy to query six months infectious events in future studies to identify the infection-prone sub-group of the population. Lifestyle habits seem to contribute to an individual's risk for RTI. Among them, cigarette smoking has been reported as a major environmental risk factor for recurrent and severe RTIs [4, 5] . Frequent contact to small children [21, 22] , vitamin D deficiency [23, 24] , and lack of physical activity [25, 26] constitute other exposures associated with heightened RTI risks. Moreover, higher levels of education were associated with a lower risk of CAP [27] . Based on those previous findings we investigated their role as possible confounders. The association between obesity and RTIs remained nearly unchanged after adjustment for age, gender, educational status, contact to children, smoking status, sports activity and nutrition scores, suggesting that the association is not markedly confounded by the effects of these factors on both BMI and the risk of infections. Also additional adjustment by measured serum vitamin D in a subgroup for which measurements were available did not change the risk estimates considerably. This supports arguments that the observed associations between obesity and RTI burden are due to physiological differences in the immune responsiveness between obese and non-obese individuals rather than lifestyle differences. In addition, some chronic diseases, foremost asthma and COPD, are associated with both an increased risk of RTIs and obesity [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . Considering these associations we investigated the effect of asthma, COPD and a comorbidity scoresummarizing the other chronic conditionson the relationship between obesity and individual RTIs and the RTI diary score. Adjusting for these conditions individually and even more so in a combined fashion resulted in a considerable attenuation of the association between obesity and considered RTI outcomes. Hence part of the association between infections and obesity might be explainable by associations of co-morbidities with both. We see a gender difference in the observed associations with more noticeable findings for women. A significantly increased risk for combined RTIs was also restricted to women in a Danish blood donor cohort [12] . Several lines of research support this notion: Szabova et al. and Ilavska et al. reported gender-dependent effects of obesity on the immune system [33, 34] . The effect of BMI on a variety of immune parameters including those with relevance for immune defence was much more apparent in women than in men [34] . NK cells (CD3-/CD16+/CD56+), represent first-line cells for the clearing of virus-infected cells. Reduced levels of these cells reported for obese women, but not for respective men, might underlie the gender effect seen in our study. We also investigated a potential effect modification by sports activity and nutrition. Interestingly, an association between obesity and RTIs was evident only for those obese individuals who reported a higher level of sports activity. Thus, only the group of obese people who engaged in more intensive sports activity reported RTIs more frequently whereas obese people with low sports activity and non-obese with low or high sports activity showed comparable lower prevalences for most outcomes. We hypothesize that oxidative stress induced by vigorous aerobic as well as anaerobic sports activity is exacerbated in people with obesity, but not in normal weight individuals. Evidence supporting this has been previously published [35] . An imbalanced oxidative stress status may have negative consequences on mounting an appropriate immune response towards respiratory pathogens. Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) was shown to hinder T cell responses to viral infection [36] and ROS accumulation was detected in autophagy-deficient effector T cells rendering them incapable of controlling viral infections [37] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 177, "end": 180, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 181, "end": 183, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 184, "end": 187, "text": "17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 664, "end": 667, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 681, "end": 685, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 700, "end": 704, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 705, "end": 708, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 911, "end": 915, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 966, "end": 970, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 971, "end": 974, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1094, "end": 1098, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1148, "end": 1152, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1381, "end": 1385, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1386, "end": 1389, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2421, "end": 2424, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2425, "end": 2427, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2465, "end": 2469, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2470, "end": 2473, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2497, "end": 2501, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2502, "end": 2505, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2538, "end": 2542, "text": "[25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2543, "end": 2546, "text": "26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2690, "end": 2694, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3616, "end": 3620, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 3621, "end": 3625, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3626, "end": 3630, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 3631, "end": 3635, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 3636, "end": 3640, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 4380, "end": 4384, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 4534, "end": 4538, "text": "[33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 4539, "end": 4542, "text": "34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 4691, "end": 4695, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 5662, "end": 5666, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 5908, "end": 5912, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 6044, "end": 6048, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "A similar surprising result was found when studying the effect modification by dietary patterns. Here we queried the participants' dietary habits and classified them as adhering to a more favourable or more unfavourable dietary pattern according to Winkler et al. [38] . Aware of the limitations of a one-time assessment of a habitual diet, we found a more pronounced relationship between obesity and infections among obese people who reported an apparent healthier diet. Thus, again only the group of obese individuals who presumably eat a healthier diet showed an increased risk of RTIs. The question arises as to whether misreporting of dietary habits among these individuals with and without RTIs may explain the puzzle. One can imagine that obese individuals may have an increased perception of RTI related symptoms experiencing the contradiction between living a healthy lifestyle and being affected by excess weight and frequent infections. On the other hand the inconspicuous results from the non-obese population with respect to favourable and unfavourable diet pattern would somewhat argue against this explanation. Alternatively, among the group of people with obesity a genetically defined subgroup may exist predisposing to both, excess body weight and proneness to infections.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 264, "end": 268, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "As strengths of our study we count 1) its sample size, allowing for the analysis of effect modification, 2) its prospective design involving 18 months infection diaries for the exploration of the relationship between BMI and subsequent RTI frequency and severity, 3) the comprehensive information on lifestyle and co-morbidities allowing to study the interplay of such factors on their effect on infections, and 4) the wide range of outcome indicators considered. The uniformity of the results with respect to these outcomes also suggests that in the field of airway infection morbidity, studies may be comparable despite the fact that they often concentrate on different RTI outcomes. In line with the majority of epidemiological studies in this area of research, our study suffers from some limitations, including the reliance on self-reported outcomes and exposure data with the risk of misclassification. However, we found -for instance -a good agreement between BMI derived from self-reported weight and height data and BMI calculated from measured values available for a sub-cohort (n = 508). Moreover, differential misclassification which would substantially bias the relationship between obesity and RTIs is rather unexpected in this setting.

In line with previous epidemiological studies as well as basic research data we observed a stronger effect of obesity on infection risk for women compared to men. The interesting interaction with sports activity and presumed nutrition awaits followup investigations in subsequent studies that ideally shall provide improved measurements of the entire spectrum of physical activity and dietary habits.
