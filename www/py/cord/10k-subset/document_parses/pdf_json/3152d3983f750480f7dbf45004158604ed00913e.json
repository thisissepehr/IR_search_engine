Sepsis consequently has a high mortality rate and a high rate of complications for survivors, despite modern medical advances. therefore, drug identification and validation for the treatment of sepsis is of the utmost importance. As a selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, rolipram also exhibits the abilities of inhibiting multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines production in macrophages and toxin-induced inflammation in mice. However, this drug has never been studied as a sepsis treatment method. We found that rolipram significantly improves survival in mice challenged with gram-negative bacterium E. coli, cLp, or E. coli derived lipopolysaccharide. We have also found that rolipram inhibits organ damage, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and intracellular migration of early-stage inflammatory elements. Our results also show that rolipram increases anti-inflammatory cytokine production. The protective effects of rolipram on septic mice may result from inhibition of the MAP kinase and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways. Rolipram may therefore be a potential novel sepsis treatment, one that would bypass the time-consuming and costly drug-discovery process.",

Most importantly, the incidence of sepsis has risen by nearly 30% in the past decade 3 . Because sepsis can be induced by different microorganisms, vaccine development is difficult to impossible.

LPS induces inflammation by binding to Toll-like receptor 4 on the host cell surface.

In the absence of rolipram, 62% of infected mice died within 60 hr of E. coli injection (Fig. 1A) .

To confirm the protective effect of rolipram both in E. coli-induced and CLP-induced septic mice, we assessed the role of rolipram in mouse sepsis induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from E. coli.

LPS-induced endotoxic shock is known to cause a number of effects in the murine host, including severe lung injury. Histopathological analysis, consisting of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of lung sections from LPS-only mice, revealed signs of extreme inflammation. Edema, neutrophil recruitment, and hemorrhage in the lung samples were also seen ( Fig. 3A ). Lung injury in the LPS group was visibly increased in comparison with the control group. Rolipram treatment, however, markedly attenuated LPS-induced lung injury. In bronchiolar lavage fluid, total protein ( Rolipram alleviates E. coli derived lipopolysaccharide-induced liver and kidney damage. H&E staining of liver tissue from control mice showed that the liver plate was radially arranged around the central vein in normal hepatic lobules. The livers of LPS-only mice sacrificed at the 24-hr time point showed structural disorder of the hepatic lobule, narrowing or even disappearance of the hepatic sinusoidal space, vacuolar degeneration of hepatocytes, and nuclear pyknosis. However, rolipram pre-treatment for 1 hr significantly reduced these changes (Fig. 4A ). Renal tissue H&E staining (Fig. 4B ) clearly showed normal structure and morphology in glomeruli, renal tubules, and renal tubular epithelial cells in control mice. The renal lumen was regular, and no inflammatory cells infiltrated the renal interstitial cells. The kidneys of LPS-only mice at the 24-hr time point showed inflammatory infiltrate in the renal interstitial cells, swelling of renal tubular epithelial cells, and an unclear cell gap. Rolipram pretreatment for 1 hr significantly reduced these changes. We also examined biochemical markers for liver and kidney injury in serum from each group of mice treated with LPS for 24 hr. Rolipram inhibited levels of aspartate and alanine aminotransferases (AST and ALT), creatinine (Cr), and brain natriuretic peptide (BUN) in serum. This indicates that rolipram can ameliorate liver and kidney injury induced by LPS ( Fig. 4C-F ).",

This is includes excessive amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 16, 17 , as well as other inflammatory mediators. These molecules can in turn trigger secondary inflammatory processes, leading to inflammatory pathology and life-threatening organ damage. Proteins that induce the migration of inflammatory cells into tissue are also upregulated. We have found that rolipram inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines released by the administration of LPS, leading to the suppression of excessive inflammatory responses, cell adhesion and migration, and the further sequelae of shock and multiple organ failure in the mouse host. Sepsis-induced multi-organ dysfunction and injury are the main mechanisms of patient shock and death. Therefore, sepsis treatment guidelines consider multi-organ dysfunction a key point of attack in sepsis treatment 18 . It has previously been reported that rolipram significantly decreased hyperoxia-induced neutrophil numbers in BALF and inhibits IL-6 and MCP-1 transcription in rat lungs 19 . Rolipram also alleviates pulmonary edema and reduces neutrophil numbers in BALF during chlorine-induced mouse shock 20 . Our results go further in showing that rolipram inhibits pulmonary edema, neutrophil infiltration in alveoli, and protein concentrations and neutrophil numbers in BALF. Liver and kidney function is also improved, indicating that rolipram can prevent LPS-induced multi-organ failure. The exact mechanism by which rolipram controls the inflammatory cascade, thereby preventing shock and multiple organ failure in the host, is unknown. However, it is known that the NF-\u03baB pathway is crucial in the regulation of inflammatory gene expression. Nuclear translocation activates the transcription and expression of a variety of cytokines and adhesion molecules, all of which are closely associated www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ with inflammation and the immune response 21 . The NF-\u03baB family, including p65 (RelA), p50/p105 (NF-\u03baB1), p52/p100 (NF-\u03baB2), RelB, and c-Rel, exist in the cytoplasm in homo-or heterodimers that can bind with I\u03baB. During conditions of stimulation by LPS or other pro-inflammatory factors, I\u03baB kinase (IKK) phosphorylates I\u03baB, leading to NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation and further activation of inflammatory genes 22 . It has been confirmed that toll-like receptor 4 -NF\u03baB signaling plays a key role in acute lung injury 23 . Our studies show that LPS activates NF-\u03baB and its signaling pathways, while rolipram restrains activation. This indicates that the NF-\u03baB may be part of the mechanism by which rolipram exerts its effects.",

            "text": "The MAPK signaling pathway also plays a critical role in regulating inflammation and the immune response. As a conserved signaling cascade, the MAPK pathway exists in almost all eukaryotic cells. MAPKs can regulate target protein function through phosphorylation, thus participating in cell proliferation, growth, differentiation, and function. MAPK signaling is activated through three levels, including MAP3K, MAPKK, and MAPK. At present, four MAPK signaling pathways have been identified: ERK1/2, ERK5, p38 MAPK, and JNK 24 . It has been found that rolipram promotes the maturation of glial progenitor cells and regeneration of myelin through enhancement of ERK phosphorylation 25 . Studies have also found that rolipram restrains bone cancer pain through inhibition of the JNK signaling pathway in the bone marrow, suppressing neuron-stellate cell activation 26 . In addition, rolipram can inhibit LPS-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation in J774 cells 13 . However, the role of rolipram on phosphorylation of the MAPK downstream signaling pathways has not yet been reported. Our results indicated that rolipram suppresses LPS-induced ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK phosphorylation in lung tissue, suggesting that the MAPK signaling pathway -as well as NF-\u03baB -may mediate the anti-inflammatory actions of rolipram.",

Rolipram may thus serve as a novel drug treatment for inflammatory disease, namely sepsis and septic shock. As rolipram is an approved drug in the United States for chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, this drug repositioning strategy may circumvent the lengthy and expensive drug discovery process, and allow faster and better treatment for sepsis patients. Animals. Male C57BL/6 mice, weighing 20-25 g, all 8-10 weeks old, were used for experiments. The mice were purchased from the Department of Laboratory Animal Science of Southern Medical University (Guangzhou, China). All animals were housed with free access to food and water under conditions of optimal light, temperature, and humidity (12:12-hr light-dark cycle, approximately 24 degrees Celsius, 50-60% humidity). All experimental procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee of Animal Research at the College of Medicine, Southern Medical University, and were conducted in accordance with the international guidelines for care and use of laboratory animals.",

Survival rate was monitored for 7 days. The experiments were repeated using variable doses of rolipram (1, 5, and 10 mg/kg). At 0, 3, 12, 24, and 48 hr after LPS injection, mice were anesthetized and sacrificed. Blood was collected for analysis of serum cytokines. For histological analysis, normal saline (10 mL) was perfused through the right heart ventricle. Lung, liver, and kidney samples were collected and processed as described later. Mouse blood samples were left at room temperature for 1 hr, then spun at 1000 \u00d7 g for 15 minutes at 4 degrees C. Serum was obtained and stored at \u221280 degrees C until required. The chemiluminescent signal was quantified; phosphorylated ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK were normalized against total ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK. Phosphorylated protein levels are expressed in arbitrary units. LPSstimulated cells were set at 100%, and other values relate to that setting. Data represent the mean and SD of at least three independent experiments, performed in triplicate.
