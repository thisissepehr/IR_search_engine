Through the lens of one funder (NIHR), our aims are to map the diversity of public health research, in terms of funding mechanisms, disciplinary contributions, and public health impacts, identify examples of impacts, and pathways to impact that existing reporting mechanisms may not otherwise have captured, and provide illustrations of how public health researchers perceive the generation of non-academic impact from their work. Methods: A total of 1386 projects were identified as 'public health research' by the NIHR and listed in the NIHR Public Health Overview database (2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014)(2015)(2016). From these, a subset of 857 projects were matched as potentially having begun reporting impacts via an external data-gathering platform (Researchfish). Data on the 857 projects were analyzed quantitatively, and nine projects were selected to investigate further through semi-structured interviews with principal investigators. Two workshops took place to validate emerging and final findings and facilitate analysis.",

The pathways to impact observed in our in-depth case studies include contributing to debates on what constitutes appropriate evidence for national policy change, acknowledging local 'unintended' impacts, building trusted relationships with stakeholders across health and non-health sectors and actors, collaborating with local authorities, and using non-academic dissemination channels. Conclusions: Public health as a discipline contributes substantially to impact beyond academia. To support the diversity of these impacts, we need to recognise localized smaller-scale impacts, and the difference in types of evidence required for community and local authority-based impacts. This will also require building capacity and resources to enable impact to take place from public health research. Finally, support is required for engagement with local authorities and working with non-health sectors that contribute to health outcomes.",

            "text": "Background 'Impact' from academic research can be defined differently by policy and practice organisations, academia, commissioners, and funders, but it broadly refers to any change or benefit to society beyond producing academic publications. For example, UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) refers to impact as \"the demonstrable contribution that excellent research makes to society and the economy\". 1 For the purposes of the UK 2014 and 2021 Research Excellence Framework (REF), impact is defined as \"an effect on, change or benefit to the economy, society, culture, public policy or services, health, the environment or quality of life, beyond academia\". Analysis and assessment of these wider impacts from research allows for better allocation of research funding, creates accountability for research, and supports advocacy initiatives in policy and practice [1] . In the case of public health research, few studies have been conducted that specifically demonstrate the contribution that the field has made to society. This may be partly due to the scarcity of research impact analyses generally, or, specifically for public health, due to the diversity of ways in which the field is described. Although there is no global, organization-wide definition of 'public health', a common point for scoping is the population health approach and the production of generalizable knowledge for future interventions [2] . For example, one of the most widely used definitions is that of the WHO based on the work of Acheson [3] , where public health is defined as \"the science and art of promoting and protecting health and wellbeing, preventing ill health and prolonging life through the organised efforts of society\". As such, there are many disciplines that could potentially contribute to what may be considered public health benefits to society, or 'public health impacts'.",

Capturing and communicating these mechanisms can enable future researchers learn how to focus their activities for impact to take place, and can help funders of health research to support and promote such activities to their award holders. Our motivation in this paper is to contribute to the scarce evidence base on public health research impact analyses, to demonstrate the value of public health research in its diverse forms, and bring to light the mechanisms and pathways through which public health research contributes to society. Through this we hope to provide accountability and advocacy for the field and inform both researchers and funders on the types of mechanisms, pathways and activities that could be supported to further encourage wider impacts from public health research.",

            "text": "At the same time, we are mindful of the challenges posed by conducting impact analysis for such a diverse field. Generally, the challenges in conducting impact analyses relate to data access, time-lags and nonlinearity of impact pathways, and attribution of impacts to research [4] [5] [6] . Firstly, the data challenge is that, unlike academic publications, impact data are not currently captured in a systematic way [7] . There are a growing number of tools to facilitate the collection of evidence for impact within research organisations, such as Researchfish\u00ae and Symplectic, through which researchers can report their impact related activities, such as media engagements, conferences, non-academic publications, and such. However, there is no standardized mechanism for evaluating or even reporting on impact more broadly (i.e. 'how did you actually make a difference?') and many researchers are not yet used to reporting impact regularly. For the purposes of the UK 2014 REF, information was collected in the form of \"impact case studies\" consisting of roughly four-page narratives now available to read in an online searchable database, 2 which allowed for a more detailed description of the impact journey and the impacts themselves. Secondly, the timing of capturing impact information is challenging as it can take in the range of 15-25 years on average for research to be translated into public impacts [8] . Furthermore, recent investigations into research impact mechanisms have highlighted that while both researchers and policy makers often assume a linear relationship between academic outputs and corresponding benefits to wider society, the majority of impacts are indirect and consequently very challenging to capture [5, 6, 9] . This literature suggests that many impacts develop over time through formal and informal professional networks and processes. These processes include 'knowledge mobilisation' [10] , the use of an embedded researcher [11] , and 'co-production' methods between researchers and practitioners [12] . There is also evidence suggesting that some impacts are achieved during the research process itself, especially in cases where the research was co-created with beneficiaries. Studies such as the Retrosight studies [13, 14] , the analysis of the REF 2014 impact case studies [15] , and a recent evaluation of the NIHR HTA programme [16] , have all highlighted examples of research where study participants had already received the benefits of the research. Analyses of impact therefore often include the intermediary steps, or 'proxies' to the ultimate impact. Finally, it is also evident that research projects build on each other in order to reach impacts, which makes it challenging to attribute single impacts to single researchers or projects.",

To simply rely on specific types of impact, such as a national change in public health policy, may neglect other impacts on beneficiaries which occur during the research itself. Furthermore, many public health research projects may not follow a linear 'evidence to public health impact' pathway; studies have highlighted that research evidence is the least frequently used form of information in public health policy and programme decision-making [17, 18] . These highlight that the context in which public health studies are undertaken, and the information needs of the different roles within organisations, are a crucial part of any examination of impact.",

[20] . This model articulates the stages of research, from conceptualisation to impact, leading to five possible kinds of payback: knowledge production (e.g., academic publications), research targeting and capacity building (e.g., training new researchers), informing policy and product development (e.g., information base for clinical policies), health and health sector benefits (e.g. cost savings and greater equity), and broader economic benefits (e.g., commercial spin-outs). Designed as a method to evaluate the payback for particular pieces of research, the model requires in-depth case studies and an evaluation of both quantitative and qualitative information, including detailed interviews with those who conducted the research and created the impact. We adopt these approaches while mindful of the opportunity to discover other impacts that may occur during any part of the research process.",

Furthermore, the NIHR does provide a varied sample of research projects relating to public health because of the breadth of programmes, methods and health areas that it funds. While our case studies are drawn from one funder, our findings should be interesting to those examining research impact more broadly, both in the field of public health and beyond.

As noted in the Background section, however, most definitions imply a focus on health of the population, which is what constituted the focus of the PHO criteria for identifying the projects tagged as public health made available to us. We have relied on the NIHR PHO coding of projects to identify our sample, from which we selected our interviewees. We trust this process was completed rigorously although caveat that we may have missed some examples of projects that could also have been considered public health.

Following publications (not included in the table), 'engagement activities' is the most commonly reported item in Researchfish (3383 instances), followed by 'collaborations' (1692). However, we also note a smaller but still substantial number of impacts on patients (724), and policy and practice (658). We note that these graphs rely on data selfreported by researchers, and therefore the emphasis given to particular types of research activity may determine what was reported within Researchfish. Each researcher may also have interpreted their activity different (putting an entry under 'engagement activity' which someone else may have considered to be 'policy and practice' or 'collaborations').

Interviewees felt that the diverse forms of evidence produced by public health research do not always correspond with those required by policy makers to effect change.

The researchers we interviewed showed great enthusiasm and motivation for responding to public health challenges. The motivation for having societal benefit (or 'impact') from their research is therefore implicit, but we identified difficulties in having the time, financial resources, and skills to take the necessary actions to facilitate it. As Redman et al. [24] have pointed out, while there are courses, tools and funding modules to assist researchers in making an impact, there is little evidence about whether these approaches work in practice, and more could be done to support researchers in making the connections they require to facilitate impact. It is not to say investigators should play no part in enabling impact from their work; indeed, some of the researchers we interviewed showed initiative in engaging stakeholders outside of their field and taking part in non-academic dissemination of their work. For others, however, there needs to be an acknowledgement of the skills and resources required for engagementor more nuanced impact-facilitatingactivities, and these may have to be shared with other colleagues or support staff.",

Greenhalgh and Fahy [6] observed examples of this in their discussion of 162 REF case studies, commenting that \"In the policy setting, [impact] occurs when researchers and policymakers, through repeated interaction over time, come to better understand each other's worlds and develop goals that are compatible if not fully aligned.\" In their work on 'productive interactions' Spaapen and van Drooge focus on capturing information about knowledge exchange interactions between researchers and stakeholders as a prerequisite to achieving impact [25] . Our case studies yielded some examples where relationships with policy-making bodies had been developed over years, and others where impacts had emerged from more fledgling relationships with stakeholders, for example through researcher interactions with hospital staff. Indeed the devolved nature of public health in the UK (following reforms in 2013 in shifting public health services and planning to local authorities) requires an understanding of local public health challenges in addition to wider national policy requirements. A systematic scoping review of the use of evidence in local English public health decision-making identified the primacy of local evidence, the important role of local experts in providing evidence and knowledge, and the high value placed on local evaluation evidence despite varying methodological rigour [26] . This suggests the need for supporting relationship building and engagement between public health researchers/experts and local decision-makers to create localised impacts. In another study data drawn from an NIHR-funded project examined how evidence is used in commissioning and planning, and also concluded the role of localised knowledge. They found that published evidence is \"made fit\" for local commission and planning by relating the evidence to local context and needs and tailored into local actionable messages [27] .",

Furthermore, there are other models for facilitating uptake of research. Ward [10] provides a useful framework for identifying and making use of 'knowledge mobilisers' who can facilitate getting evidence into practice or policy. The use of an 'embedded researcher' has been shown to be productive also in mobilising knowledge in general quality improvement [11] but also specifically in exchanging knowledge between public health research and a local authority in the UK [29] . Another mechanism is the use of the researcher in residence model [30] . All of these do require either shifting of funding resources on existing projects or funding specific for these types of activities.",

Upton et al. studied individual and institutional perspectives on research impact in nine universities and found that qualities to enable impact include a high degree of motivation with regards to knowledge transfer mechanisms and other skills that support translation [31] . Bayley and Phipps [32] argue for building 'impact literacy' -developing staff capacity to judge, articulate and optimise impact across contexts. They highlight evidence that integrated methods of generating impact are more effective than end-of-grant methods.

Though evidence of the causal nature of this is not conclusive, Guthrie et al.

Case studies touched on the need to think about timing (hitting the right 'policy window' as suggested by Kingdon [35] and discussed by Cairney [36] ), negotiating the presentation of negative findings, and understanding the different types of evidence required by those responsible for implementing public health initiatives. It may also be the case that the type of evidence required for change goes beyond that traditionally produced by researchers, which would also require a greater focus on how results might translate in specific social and political contexts. For example, in her evaluation of the kinds of evidence used in understanding the social determinants of health, O'Campo argues that \"research should not stop at demonstrating whether and how a program or policy improves well-being. More detailed information is also needed to facilitate adaptation, tailoring, and implementation of those programs and policies to local settings and target populations\" [37] . Further, while evidence drawn from large controlled intervention trials meets higher standards of rigour, this evidence is not necessarily the most applicable to 'real world' practice [38] and may hinder the implementation of costeffective interventions. Fischer et al. have argued that in the case of many public health interventions it is impractical to demonstrate individual effects through RCTs, but such interventions may be cost-effective even without evidence demonstrating efficacy [39] .",

Some of the challenges associated with these barriers could be overcome with better communication and relationships between researchers and practitioners. In addition to providing the appropriate form of evidence, stakeholder engagement also plays a major part of facilitating impact as observed in our case studies. Researchers we interviewed we were able to ascertain the importance of high quality engagement with stakeholders such as local authorities and public health practitioners. They also acknowledged that given the interdisciplinary nature of complex public health problems, more inter-sectoral collaboration is needed. This may imply continuous shifts in the way financial resources are allocated at the local authority level to support public health activity, and working with initiatives in transport, social care, and education to tackle public health issues.",

Although population health improvement may be considered the endpoint for public health research impact, short and medium-term changes that facilitate this goal can also be considered impacts arising from this field [9] . The question of how these short and medium-term impacts should be accounted for in research impact analyses is a prominent feature of the literature on this subject [25, 41] . Further, while participants tended to focus on more direct, quantifiable forms of impact such as incorporation into policies or guidelines, our case studies also drew out several examples where participants had achieved less tangible forms of impact. This included impacts achieved through informal networks, non-academic publications and those coproduced with research participants. This also carries implications for how impact is understood and measured, especially in cases where research has a qualitative component which often produces less direct pathways to impact. As Greenhalgh and Fahy [6] have noted, the emphasis of the REF impact case study format on measurable impacts are such that these examples of research involving more complex and indirect pathways to impact are rare. Our analysis suggests that improving the recording and understanding of less tangible pathways to impact would render these more visible, and increase the likelihood of public health research being translated into practice in ways that benefit patients and the public.",

Interviews with PIs and other researchers associated with the projects also pointed to the pivotal role played by researchers' own assumptions and initiatives in determining research impact. To support impacts from public health research, we encourage the acknowledgement and measuring of impact at different stages of the impact pathway, including localised impacts, and the difference in types of evidence required for community and local authority-based impacts.

Participants were sent a letter by email which outlined the nature of the project and what participation involved, and made clear that participation was entirely voluntary. It was not deemed practical to obtain written consent as participants were all interviewed over the phone and located in different parts of the country. This procedure was approved by the ethics committee, who note that where written consent is not practical, verbal consent may be obtained. Verbal consent was given to take part in interviews, and participants approved the use of quotes included in the study.",
