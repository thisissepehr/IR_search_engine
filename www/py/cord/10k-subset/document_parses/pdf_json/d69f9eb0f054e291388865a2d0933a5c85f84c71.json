Patients with HFMD usually have good prognosis; however, in some extreme cases the infection can be accompanied by central nervous system diseases, eventually leading to cardiorespiratory failure, and even death. Currently, EV71 has become one of the most important pathogens infecting central nervous system, after poliovirus. Previous studies have shown that lung injury in patients with HFMD is associated with neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) after EV71 infection of the brainstem, rather than with direct viral invasion (Jiang et al. 2012 ). This might be because EV71 was not isolated and inflammatory cell infiltration rarely occurred in lung and lung injured tissues (Kao et al. 2004; Jiang et al. 2012) . EV71 can be transmitted through respiratory tract and cause upper respiratory tract infection, such as herpangina; nevertheless, the translocation route from the upper respiratory tract to the lung tissue or through viremia to the lung still remains unclear. Viral receptors have an important role in mediating the specific binding of viruses to the target cells. The distribution of viral receptors is usually closely related to the host range and tissue tropism of the viruses, and is considered as one of the key factors for viral pathogenicity. To further explore the causes of lung injury by EV71, we first examined the distribution of EV71 receptor in normal human lung tissues, and then investigated the target cells of EV71 infection, thus providing the molecular basis for the lung infected EV71. Consequently, the pathological changes in the lung tissues of fatal EV71 infection were perceived, and the distribution of EV71 antigen and various inflammatory cells in the lung tissues were detected.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 623, "end": 641, "text": "(Jiang et al. 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 773, "end": 790, "text": "(Kao et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 791, "end": 809, "text": "Jiang et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Dear Editor,"}, {"text": "To investigate whether EV71 could infect the lung tissues of lower respiratory tract, the distribution of EV71 receptor, PSGL-1 (human P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1) and SCARB2 (human scavenger receptor class B member 2) (Nishimura et al. 2009; Yamayoshi et al. 2009 ) were examined in the lung tissue specimens collected form 12 patients with tumor or non-inflammatory diseases.
