In other words, the main reason for the gap between IHR and JEE in the current world is the different interpretation of core capacity evaluation of high HDI countries though low CL countries tended to overscored their capacity. The situation could be improved while JEE provided opportunity for experts to increase the related discussion. Further studies are needed to understand the impact and outcome of JEE 2.0.
