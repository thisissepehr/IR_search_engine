A recent analysis found no significant difference in the risk of serious viral infections, including PTLD, in recipients of unrelated UCB or unmanipulated marrow [35] . However, the incidence of EBV-related complications was reported to be significantly higher in a subset of patients treated with a nonmyeloablative preparative regimen that included ATG, although overall survival was not different [36] . ATG is a known risk factor for EBV infection [37] , and more than 75% (46/61) of the patients in our study received ATG, but as we did not perform regular EBV monitoring in the early period of this study, we could not analyze the incidence of EBV. Recently, Heslop proposed that early intervention or even prophylactic administration may be warranted where there is a high risk of developing PTLD, such as a patient who has received potent T cell depleting or suppressing antibodies [38] .
