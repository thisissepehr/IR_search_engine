Twenty-six species of seven genera of euphausiids occurred during the survey. Among them, subarctic-transitional Euphausia pacifica was the most abundant throughout the year in coastal waters, as their relative contribution to the total abundance of euphausiids was 89-92%. This species occurred in each coastal water throughout the survey and was abundant from winter to early summer (February-June) off Sanriku and Joban and in autumn in south-eastern Hokkaido. Thysanoessa inspinata occurred off southeastern Hokkaido and Sanriku throughout the survey, mainly in spring (April) but rarely occurred off Joban. Three other subarctic Thysanoessa species occurred mainly off south-eastern Hokkaido from winter to spring. Conversely, warm-and transitional-water epipelagic species occurred exclusively off Sanriku and Joban in autumn.

Therefore, the difference in annual distributional pattern of subarctic euphausiids might reflect that of cold water mass distribution. However, the abundance of these Thysanoessa species in warmer areas could be underestimated because the high temperatures in the shallow layer may limit the upward movement to the upper 150 m shown by T. inspinata. 48 Odate 54 and Kodama and Izumi 55 suggested that fishery conditions of E. pacifica is not favorable in the Sanriku area when the first branch of Oyashio Current is extremely strong and extreme cold temperatures are prevailing over Sanriku waters, because fishable populations are distributed in the southern Joban area.
