HCM is considered to be a family of disorders with a high degree of genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity (1 ) . HCM can be subdivided on the basis of genetic findings into myofilament (\"sarcomeric\") HCM, Z-disc HCM, calcium-handling HCM, and metabolic HCM, depending on which component of the molecular motor of the heart is affected. The prevalence of mutations in the 3 most frequently affected genes (MYH7, MYBPC3, and TNNT2) ranges from 26% to 56% in different international cohorts (2 ) . Genetic testing in HCM has a demonstrated value in establishing a correct diagnosis, and such testing has also helped disclose genotype-phenotype relationships, which have in turn been used to refine the diagnostic algorithm. For example, recent work by Binder and coworkers suggests that patients with reverse septal curvature should first be screened for mutations affecting the myofilament (3 ) . Despite recent technological improvements, comprehensive genetic screening for mutations in 25 possibly affected genes remains a major challenge, especially in the context of large genetic clinical studies aimed at assessing the genetic etiology of HCM. We therefore performed a proof-of-principle experiment that investigated whether high-density oligonucleotide microarrays can be used to detect heterozygous mutations by means of parallel resequencing of multiple genes in multiple samples.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 34, "end": 35, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 271, "end": 275, "text": "(1 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 653, "end": 657, "text": "(2 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1053, "end": 1057, "text": "(3 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "\u00a9 2008 American Association for Clinical Chemistry"}, {"text": "The HCM1 custom resequencing array was designed according to the CustomSeq\u2122 Resequencing array design guide (Affymetrix).

The amplicons were quantified with Quant-iT\u2122 PicoGreen \u00ae dsDNA Reagent (Invitrogen). Equimolar amounts of the 9 amplicons for 1 DNA sample (i.e., 1 patient) were pooled, the amplicon pool was concentrated with the QIAquick PCR purification Kit (Qiagen), and the concentration of the DNA was measured by ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy. DNA fragmentation, labeling, hybridization, washing, and staining of the arrays were carried out according to the GeneChip \u00ae CustomSeq\u2122 Resequencing Array Protocol Version 2.0 (Affymetrix; additional protocol information can be found at http://www.affymetrix.com/ support/downloads/manuals/customseq_protocol.pdf). In brief, the pooled DNA was digested to generate fragments approximately 50 bp in size, which were then labeled through terminal transfer of biotinylated deoxynucleotides. Three micrograms of the resulting \"target DNA\" was then hybridized to the probe array overnight with tetramethylammonium chloride to counteract sequence-dependent differences in the melting temperatures of probe/target DNA hybrids. Hybridization was followed by a 2-step wash protocol, after which target DNA fragments remained preferentially bound to the probes with a full sequence match of 25 bp, whereas probe/target DNA hybrids with a mismatch in the central position were abrogated. Finally, the arrays were stained and scanned with the Gene-Chip \u00ae 3000 Scanner (Affymetrix). Affymetrix GCOS 1.4 and GSEQ 4.0 software (default settings) were used to process the raw data into nucleotide sequences. To identify a sequenced base, the software compared the signal intensities of the 4 fields that represent 1 probe \"quartet.\" A base was unequivocally identified (\"called\") when the signal intensities from both the sense and antisense probe quartets fit the same out of 4 homozygous or 6 heterozygous models (A, C, G, T, A/C, A/G, A/T, C/G, C/T, G/T).

Four putative disease-causing singlenucleotide variants (SNVs) were detected by both methods, whereas a 3-bp deletion (MYH7 c.2539_ 2541del) was detected only by ACS (ACS and HCM1 array detection rates, 50% and 40%, respectively). An ambiguous call (N) was assigned on average to 1 360 of the 27 048 bp interrogated on each array (mean N call rate, 5%). Most Ns (95%) recurred in various samples and were found in runs of \u05462 Ns, an observation suggestive of genomic regions with poor hybridization characteristics (4 ) where heterozygous mutations are unlikely to be detected. Notably, about three quarters of all Ns fall into intronic sequences. The mean call rate of the coding regions (plus splice sites) was therefore greater than that of the entire array (97.5% vs 95%). When focusing on the exons and splice sites, we observed a mean of 26 nonrecurrent Ns (single Ns) per array, which had to be reviewed carefully so as to not overlook missense and splice site mutations (see below). Of the 125 heterozygous sites (65 different SNVs) that we identified in the 10 samples by ACS, a single site remained undetected in the array-based assay; the reference base was called. Conversely, the array detected a single heterozygous mutation that was missed by conventional sequencing because the mutant signal fell below the threshold of 30% of the wild-type signal in both the sense and antisense strands. False-positive calls were found exclusively within runs of recurrent Ns, which were not considered in calculations of assay comparability.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 216, "end": 225, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "To further assess the sensitivity of the array-based assay, we tested 25 previously characterized HCM samples in 2 independent experimental series (see Table 2 in the online Data Supplement).

Of the 24 SNVs, 21 SNVs in experiment 1 and 21 in experiment 2 were automatically detected by the GSEQ software with the default analysis settings. One SNV in experiment 1 and 2 SNVs in experiment 2 produced a single-N call, i.e., an ambiguous call in a position with high-confidence base assignment in all of the other samples; however, visual inspection of the probe-intensity windows clearly confirmed the presence of a heterozygous mutation. The polymorphism c.706 A\u03feG (p.Ser236Gly) was correctly identified in 1 patient, but it hindered the detection of the adjacent allelic mutation (c.709T\u03feC) in another. Two mutations in experiment 1 and 1 mutation in experiment 2 fell in regions with recurrent Ns and could not be detected. In summary, visual inspection of both the SNV table and the probe-intensity windows of single Ns allowed the detection of 96% of the known SNVs/mutations in experiment 1 and 92% in experiment 2.

Testing of both the causative mutations and the modifying single-nucleotide polymorphisms/SNVs in parallel is therefore thought to improve the predictive value of the genotype (5 ). High-density oligonucleotide microarrays offer the opportunity to conduct both tests on a single analytical platform. Although single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays have been used extensively, little is known about the sensitivity of mutation detection with ABR (4, 6 ) . Our data suggest that the HCM1 array is an effective alternative to conventional capillary sequencing. Al-though some insertion/deletion mutations were missed, the array detected almost all of the known missense mutations tested. The 39% detection rate of ABR compares well with the rates reported in recent metaanalyses (2 ) . The missense mutations that were missed fell within G/C-rich regions that might be better resolved by adjusting probe length (7 ) and by shifting the position of the variable base toward one end of the probe (8 ) . It is worth noting in this context that an N-call rate of 2.5% for the coding sequences represents a considerable limitation of the ABR approach. The high number of Ns is linked to the base-call algorithm that requires unambiguous signals from both DNA strands to be called as either a homozygote or a heterozygote; however, most of the N\u0408s (\u054680%) can be resolved by visual inspection of the probe intensities, because either the sense probe or the antisense probe provides clear-cut results.
