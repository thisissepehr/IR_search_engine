In the univariate analysis (Table 3) , factors associated This high mortality rate must be kept in mind when considering PJP prophylaxis in patients with non-HIVrelated severe immunosuppression: failure to protect 'atrisk' patients will carry a significant amount of fatalities. This is especially relevant given that daily or thrice-weekly trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has an efficacy rate approaching 100 % in the prevention of PJP [19] . Indeed, in our series as in others, no case of PJP was documented in patients receiving this prophylactic regimen. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) recommends PJP prophylaxis in ARDS acute respiratory distress syndrome patients with hematologic and solid malignancies receiving cytotoxic chemotherapies, organ transplantation, and those treated with immune-suppressive regimens for inflammatory conditions. In addition, the ATS advises to consider prophylaxis during time periods where prednisone dose exceeds 20 mg/day for longer than 1 month, especially if the patient has associated T cell defects or is receiving other cytotoxic drugs or anti-TNF agents. Some experts also recommend monitoring CD4 cell counts in immunocompromised, non-HIV patients, using the threshold of 200 CD4 cells/mm 3 for determining the need for PJP prophylaxis [13] . Most patients diagnosed with PJP have a defect in T cell immunity, whether from a disease (HIV infection, hematologic malignancy) or from immunosuppressive therapy, especially with corticosteroids [5, 11, 16] . In this regard, our study is similar to a previous study of PJP in non-HIVinfected patients, where: (1) underlying hematologic malignancies account for the majority of predisposing diseases;", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1063, "end": 1067, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1914, "end": 1918, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2118, "end": 2121, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2122, "end": 2125, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2126, "end": 2129, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 488, "end": 495, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 655, "end": 664, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Outcome"}, {"text": "(2) corticosteroid use is a very common risk factor, found in 90 % of cases in our study (63/70), as also in cohorts not restricted to ICU patients (e.g., 204 of the 264 non-HIVinfected patients diagnosed with PJP at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center during the years 1963-1992 [16] ). The analysis of the risk factors for mortality in cohorts of non-HIV-infected patients with PJP has mostly identified the usual markers associated with death in ICU patients with respiratory diseases: mechanical ventilation [18] , severity scores [20] , ARDS, and shock (current study). However, the identification of these 'obvious' prognosis markers is of limited consequences, as these are mostly non-modifiable factors already present by the time patients are admitted to the ICU. Of more interest is the identification of prognosis markers that are modifiable. Of these, Festic et al. identified 'intubation delay' [20] , with a mean time from ICU admission to intubation of 4 h in patients who survived, as compared to 48 h in patients who died (p00.03). This finding lead the authors to recommend early intubation and institution of mechanical ventilation on admission to the ICU for patients with ARF due to non-HIV-related PJP [20] . In the study presented herein, the identification of HSV or CMV on BAL was associated with in-ICU mortality on univariate analysis (p00.0031). This association may be causal, as herpes viruses are able to induce specific lesions of the lower respiratory tract, hence, worsening the lung damages caused by PJP [21, 22] . Unfortunately, due to the high risk of severe complications associated with lung biopsies in these patients (e.g., pneumothorax [20] ), no samples were available for histological studies. In addition, herpes viruses-related cytopathogenic effect was not investigated on BAL in our center during the study period. Hence, we cannot exclude that the association between the presence of herpes viruses on BAL and mortality may be due to confusion bias. Indeed, it is conceivable that herpes viruses replication in the respiratory tract would merely be a marker of severe immunosuppression and/or severe ARDS, without playing a significant role in the pathways of PJP and in the outcome. Sepkowitz stated, in a landmark review on PJP in non-HIV-infected patients published almost two decades ago, that \"in patients who are responding slowly or not at all, early repeat bronchoscopy should be considered to exclude the presence of additional pathogens, particularly CMV\" [16] . Although the association between CMV or HSV on BAL and mortality observed in our study is in accordance with Sepkowitz's statement, it does not constitute evidence that CMV or HSV directly contribute to patients' death, especially given that the presence of CMV or HSV in BAL was no longer predictive of death in the multivariate analysis. In addition, given the observational design of our study, its findings are limited by the heterogeneity of the methods used for the diagnosis of herpes virus infection over the study period . This represents a potential classification bias.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 287, "end": 291, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 519, "end": 523, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 542, "end": 546, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 915, "end": 919, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1231, "end": 1235, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1547, "end": 1551, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1552, "end": 1555, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1686, "end": 1690, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2523, "end": 2527, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Outcome"}, {"text": "In a monocentric cohort of non-HIV-infected patients with PJP, non-restricted to ICU patients (n078, including 58 documented), Arend et al. found that concomitant pulmonary infection, mostly bacterial pneumonia and CMV, was present in 35 % of the patients, and was associated with an increased risk of death, with a relative risk of 4.5 (95 % CI, 1.5-11.0, p0 0.01) [18] . In Festic et al.'s study, the presence of microorganisms on Gram stains or cultures was not associated with mortality (p00.16), but testing for viruses on respiratory specimens was not mentioned in this particular study [20] . Lastly, Kim et al. found no association between the identification of CMV on BAL and prognosis (morbidity and mortality) in a cohort of 106 non-HIV-infected patients with PJP not restricted to ICU patients, and concluded that it is not essential to administer an anti-CMV regimen when CMV is co-isolated from the BAL in patients with PJP [17] . However, only a randomized controlled trial would adequately address this question, but this is unlikely to occur, because of the low incidence of PJP in non-HIV-infected patients. Meanwhile, given the bad prognosis associated with herpes virus coinfection in non-HIV-infected patients with PJP and the availability of antiviral agents active against CMV or HSV, many experts would recommend treating these viruses if identified on BAL in immunocompromised patients with PJP.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 366, "end": 370, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 593, "end": 597, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 608, "end": 618, "text": "Kim et al.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 938, "end": 942, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Outcome"}, {"text": "The benefits of corticosteroids as adjunctive treatment for PJP have been clearly established in HIV-infected patients [12] [13] [14] through three randomized clinical trials of different designs, all reaching similar conclusions (e.g., a 50 % reduction in mortality rates in the largest study) [2] . In non-HIV-infected patients with severe PJP, the jury is still out: Pareja et al. found that doses >60 mg of equivalent prednisone per day were associated with a lower duration of mechanical ventilation and length of stay in the ICU [12] . However, there was no impact on mortality and in the need for ETI. More recently, Delclaux et al. found no significant benefit associated with adjunctive corticosteroids in terms of the need for mechanical ventilation and mortality [14] . Both studies were observational and of limited sample size (n031 and n030, respectively). Hence, there is currently neither evidence in favor of nor against adjuvant corticosteroid therapy in this setting. In our study, mortality was similar in patients with or without adjuvant corticosteroids, but we were limited by sample size and observational design. Again, only randomized controlled trials would appropriately address this issue, but this would require a large, multicentric, adequately powered clinical trial. The low incidence of PJP in non-HIVtreated patients and the heterogeneity of patients affected are some of the obstacles that these trials would have to face.
