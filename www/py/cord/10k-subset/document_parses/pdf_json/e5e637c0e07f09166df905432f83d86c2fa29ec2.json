In children, several observational studies have demonstrated an association of elevated blood lactate levels with adverse outcomes in septic shock [11, [52] [53] [54] .

Although blood lactate may be affected by the conditions of the blood draw (e.g., use of a tourniquet), both venous and arterial lactate measurements obtained have been shown to be independently associated with mortality in children [55] .

Studies reported improvements in mortality, length of stay (LOS), duration of organ dysfunction, and development of new or progressive multiple organ dysfunction syndrome [8, 32-34, 36, 57-61] . Most of these studies have focused on timely delivery of a \"bundle of therapies\" (e.g., blood culture, fluid bolus, and antibiotics). For example, an analysis of 1179 children with sepsis across 54 hospitals in New York State found that completion of a sepsis bundle within 1 h was associated with lower risk-adjusted OR of in-hospital mortality (0.59; 95% CI, 0.38-0.93; p = 0.02) [8] .

Identification of a blood-borne pathogen can have significant clinical implications on the type and duration of antimicrobial therapy and is an important mechanism to recognize multidrugresistant pathogens [62] . Thus, whenever possible, blood cultures should be obtained prior to initiation of antimicrobial therapy in children with severe sepsis or septic shock. Although no studies have directly measured the effect of blood cultures alone on outcome in pediatric sepsis, several observational studies have demonstrated that a bundled approach to initial resuscitation that includes early blood cultures is associated with improved outcomes [8, 31, 33] . If collection of the blood cultures is likely to delay administration of antimicrobial therapy to the patient, then administration of antimicrobials should take precedence, in view of the impact of delayed antimicrobial administration on patient outcomes [63] . However, because blood cultures may be the only source of information identifying bacterial antibiotic susceptibility, it is important to make all reasonable efforts to collect blood cultures before timely antimicrobial administration. The collection of other biological specimens to identify pathogens from nonblood sites (e.g., urine, cerebrospinal fluid, tracheal aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage, drainage from collections) should also happen as soon as possible, and depending on the suspected site of infection, such specimens may have a higher yield of pathogen identification than blood cultures. Clinicians should also consider the epidemiology of pediatric infections in relation to age, sex, and host factors, such as comorbidities [64, 65] .

Bedside ultrasound may also be helpful to assess fluid overload, as there is emerging evidence to suggest that a \"full\" inferior vena cava with minimal variation across the respiratory cycle demonstrated on ultrasound indicates a fluid-replete circulation [191] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 826, "end": 831, "text": "[191]", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "We recommend removal of intravascular access"}, {"text": "We suggest using crystalloids, rather than albumin, for the initial resuscitation of children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction (weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "20."}, {"text": "Remarks: Although there is no difference in outcomes, this recommendation takes into consideration cost and other barriers of administering albumin compared with crystalloids.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "20."}, {"text": "Rationale: The FEAST trial investigated 3141 African children with infection and impaired perfusion, who were randomly assigned to resuscitation with 5% human albumin solution or 0.9% saline boluses or no boluses at admission to the hospital.

Although no pediatric RCTs compare balanced/ buffered crystalloids to 0.9% saline, there are two large observational studies in children with sepsis [193, 194] .

Indirect evidence from adult patients, including two large RCTs, also demonstrates benefit with balanced/buffered crystalloids over 0.9% saline, with adult patients who received larger volumes of fluid and those with sepsis exhibiting the greatest benefit [192, 195] . Taken together, these data support that the desirable consequences of balanced/ buffered crystalloids probably outweigh the undesirable consequences (including cost), especially in those who require large volume of fluid resuscitation.

Hence, we suggest not attempting to make this distinction using clinical assessments alone, although this categorical distinction may be helpful if advanced hemodynamic monitoring is available to assess patient physiology more accurately. Examples of advanced monitoring include invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring with pulse contour analysis, ultrasound Doppler of the ascending or descending thoracic aorta (suprasternal or esophageal Doppler), cardiac ultrasound/echocardiography [210] , or measurement of Scvo2 [190] . All of these variables (other than Scvo2) will provide additional assessment of cardiac index and/or systemic vascular resistance index beyond clinical signs, which may then be used to direct and titrate treatment. There is also emerging evidence that fluid responsiveness may be predicted by aortic blood flow peak velocity variation in mechanically ventilated children [211] . In an RCT of 90 children admitted to a PICU in Egypt, addition of serial echocardiography provided early recognition of septic myocardial dysfunction and hypovolemia that was not apparent on clinical assessment and resulted in faster shock reversal, less fluid overload, shorter LOS, and lower mortality compared with the group without serial echocardiography [210] .

Furthermore, chest radiograph findings can \"lag\" behind clinical deterioration [238, 239] such that patients with refractory shock and a \"negative\" chest radiograph may still progress toward more overt ARDS. Lung ultrasound may provide an alternative tool to chest radiograph in detecting lung pathology, but its utility to identify which sepsis patients may benefit from early mechanical ventilation is not yet clear [240] [241] [242] [243] .

One study from 1984 [244] enrolled acutely injured adults and children (44 intubated with etomidate vs 90 intubated with a benzodiazepine and opioid). A more recent study [245] enrolled children with meningococcal sepsis or septic shock with 23 intubated with etomidate as compared with 37 intubated with any other combination of sedatives. Although caution must be taken given the small sample size, each of these studies reported higher mortality after use of etomidate (pooled OR, 4.51; 95% CI, 1.82-11.16) (Supplemental Table 13 , Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links .lww.com/PCC/B139).

However, no RCTs in either critically ill children or children with sepsis-induced PARDS compare the effect of noninvasive ventilation to invasive mechanical ventilation on clinical outcomes. Observational studies have tested whether noninvasive mechanical ventilation could mitigate the need for invasive mechanical ventilation but none specifically focused on children with sepsis [250] [251] [252] [253] [254] [255] [256] . We undertook a meta-analysis of three observational studies that evaluated the association of noninvasive mechanical ventilation with mortality in a general PICU population [252, 254, 257] .

Most recent RCTs in adults support use of prone positioning as a potentially life-saving management strategy (Supplemental Table 16 , Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links .lww.com/ PCC/B139), especially in those meeting severe ARDS criteria (i.e., P/F < 150 mm Hg) [286] .

However, timing of CRRT initiation was at the discretion of the treating team, raising concern for confounding between groups, and all patients in both groups experienced normalization of kidney function [474] (Supplemental Table 31 , Supplemental Digital Content 1, http:// links .lww.com/PCC/B139).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 813, "end": 818, "text": "[474]", "ref_id": "BIBREF407"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 819, "end": 841, "text": "(Supplemental Table 31", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "71."}, {"text": "The possible benefits of CRRT must also be weighed against potential risks, including the need for an invasive catheter, costs, limited availability in some centers, the need for clinician and nursing-specialist expertise, and the challenge of optimal timing (e.g., following resuscitation for fluid removal or earlier for acute cytokine clearance).

PICO 51 52. We suggest not withholding enteral feeding solely on the basis of vasoactive-inotropic medication administration (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). PICO 48 Remarks: Enteral feeding is not contraindicated in children with septic shock after adequate hemodynamic resuscitation who no longer require escalating doses of vasoactive agents or in whom weaning of vasoactive agents has started 53. We suggest enteral nutrition as the preferred method of feeding and that parenteral nutrition may be withheld in the first 7 days of PICU admission in children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction (weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).

We suggest against transfusion of red blood cells if the blood hemoglobin concentration is \u2265 7 g/dL in hemodynamically stabilized children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). PICO 38 Remarks: According to the 2018 Transfusion and Anemia Expertise Initiative (TAXI) guidelines, for the purposes of red blood cell transfusion, \"hemodynamically stabilized\" is defined as a mean arterial blood pressure higher than 2 standard deviations below normal for age and no increase in vasoactive medications for at least 2 h 66. We cannot make a recommendation regarding hemoglobin transfusion thresholds for critically ill children with unstable septic shock. PICO 38 67 . We suggest against prophylactic platelet transfusion based solely on platelet levels in non-bleeding children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction and thrombocytopenia (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). PICO 40 68. We suggest against prophylactic plasma transfusion in non-bleeding children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction and coagulation abnormalities (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

In children who present as acutely unwell, we suggest implementing systematic screening for timely recognition of septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). PICO 1 Remarks: Systematic screening needs to be tailored to the type of patients, resources, and procedures within each institution. Evaluation for the effectiveness and sustainability of screening should be incorporated as part of this process 2. We were unable to issue a recommendation about using blood lactate values to stratify children with suspected septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction into low-versus high-risk of having septic shock or sepsis. PICO 2 3. We recommend implementing a protocol/guideline for management of children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction (BPS). PICO 3 4. We recommend obtaining blood cultures before initiating antimicrobial therapy in situations where this does not substantially delay antimicrobial administration (BPS). PICO 4Antimicrobial therapy5. In children with septic shock, we recommend starting antimicrobial therapy as soon as possible, within 1 h of recognition (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence). PICO 6", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF14": {"text": "). PICO 11 Remarks: This assessment should include a review of the ongoing indication for empiric antimicrobial therapy after the first 48 h that is guided by microbiologic results and in response to clinical improvement and/or evidence of infection resolution. This recommendation applies to patients being treated with empiric, targeted, and combination therapy 14. We recommend determining the duration of antimicrobial therapy according to the site of infection, microbial etiology, response to treatment, and ability to achieve source control (BPS). PICO 10 Source control15. We recommend that emergent source control intervention be implemented as soon possible after a diagnosis of an infection amenable to a source control procedure is made (BPS). PICO 12 Remarks: Appropriate diagnostic testing to identify the site of infection and microbial etiology should be performed, and advice from specialist teams (e.g., infectious diseases, surgery) should be sought, as appropriate, in order to prioritize interventions needed to achieve source control16. We recommend removal of intravascular access devices that are confirmed to be the source of sepsis or septic shock after other vascular access has been established and depending on the pathogen and the risks/benefits of a surgical procedure (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). PICO 13 Fluid therapy 17. In healthcare systems with availability of intensive care, we suggest administering up to 40-60 mL/kg in bolus fluid (10-20 mL/kg per bolus) over the first hour, titrated to clinical markers of cardiac output and discontinued if signs of fluid overload develop, for the initial resuscitation of children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). PICO 17 18. In healthcare systems with no availability of intensive care and in the absence of hypotension, we recommend against bolus fluid administration while starting maintenance fluids (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). PICO 17 19. In healthcare systems with no availability of intensive care, if hypotension is present, we suggest administering up to 40 mL/kg in bolus fluid (10-20 mL/kg per bolus) over the first hour with titration to clinical markers of cardiac output and discontinued if signs of fluid overload develop (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). PICO 17 Remarks: Clinical markers of cardiac output may include heart rate, blood pressure, capillary refill time, level of consciousness, and urine output. In all settings, the need for fluid administration should be guided by frequent reassessment of clinical markers of cardiac output, serial blood lactate measurement and advanced monitoring, when available. Signs of fluid overload that should limit further fluid bolus therapy may include clinical signs of pulmonary edema or new or worsening hepatomegaly 20. We suggest using crystalloids, rather than albumin, for the initial resuscitation of children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction (weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). PICO 15 Remarks: Although there is no difference in outcomes, this recommendation takes into consideration cost and other barriers of administering albumin compared to crystalloids 21.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF15": {"text": "). PICO 18 Remarks: Advanced hemodynamic monitoring may include cardiac output/cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, or central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO 2 )27. We suggest using trends in blood lactate levels, in addition to clinical assessment, to guide resuscitation of children with septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence).PICO  19 Remarks: In children with an elevated blood lactate, repeat testing that reveals a persistent elevation in blood lactate may indicate incomplete hemodynamic resuscitation and should prompt efforts, as needed, to further promote hemodynamic stability Vasoactive medications 28. We suggest using epinephrine, rather than dopamine, in children with septic shock (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). PICO 22 29. We suggest using norepinephrine, rather than dopamine, in children with septic shock (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). PICO 23 30. We were unable to issue a recommendation for a specific first-line vasoactive infusion for children with septic shock. PICO 22/23 31. We were unable to issue a recommendation about initiating vasoactive agents through peripheral access in children with septic shock. PICO 26 Remarks: It is reasonable to begin vasoactive infusions after 40-60 mL/kg of fluid resuscitation if the patient continues to have evidence of abnormal perfusion. Either epinephrine or norepinephrine may be administered through a peripheral vein (or intraosseous, if in place) if central venous access is not readily accessible. Dopamine may be substituted as the first-line vasoactive infusion, administered either peripherally or centrally, if epinephrine or norepinephrine is not readily available 32. We suggest either adding vasopressin or further titrating catecholamines in children with septic shock who require high-dose catecholamines (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). PICO 25 Remarks: No consensus was achieved on the optimal threshold for initiating vasopressin. Therefore, this decision should be made according to individual clinician preference 33. We were unable to issue a recommendation about adding an inodilator in children with septic shock and cardiac dysfunction despite other vasoactive agents. PICO 24 Ventilation 34. We were unable to issue a recommendation about whether to intubate children with fluid-refractory, catecholamine-resistant septic shock. PICO 27 35. We suggest not to use etomidate when intubating children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). PICO 28 36. We suggest a trial of non-invasive mechanical ventilation (over invasive mechanical ventilation) in children with sepsis-induced pediatric ARDS (PARDS) without a clear indication for intubation and who are responding to initial resuscitation (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). PICO 29 Remarks: When non-invasive mechanical ventilation is initiated, clinicians should carefully and frequently re-evaluate the patient' s condition 37. We suggest using high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in children with sepsis-induced PARDS (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). PICO 30 Remarks: The exact level of high PEEP has not been tested or determined in PARDS patients. Some RCTs and observational studies in PARDS have used and advocated for use of the ARDS-network PEEP to fractional inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) grid though adverse hemodynamic effects of high PEEP may be more prominent in children with septic shock 38. We cannot suggest for or against the use of recruitment maneuvers in children with sepsis-induced PARDS and refractory hypoxemia. PICO 31 Remarks: If a recruitment maneuver is considered, the use of a stepwise, incremental and decremental PEEP titration maneuver is preferred over sustained inflation techniques that have not been optimized through direct testing in PARDS patients. All PARDS patients must be carefully monitored for tolerance of the maneuver 39. We suggest a trial of prone positioning in children with sepsis and severe PARDS (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). PICO 32 Remarks: Research trials in adults with ARDS and children with PARDS have emphasized prone positioning for at least 12 h per day, as tolerated 40. We recommend against the routine use of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in all children with sepsis-induced PARDS (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). PICO 33 41. We suggest using iNO as a rescue therapy in children with sepsisinduced PARDS and refractory hypoxemia after other oxygenation strategies have been optimized (weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). PICO 33 42. We were unable to issue a recommendation to use high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) versus conventional ventilation in children with sepsis-induced PARDS. PICO 34 43. We suggest using neuromuscular blockade in children with sepsis and severe PARDS (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). PICO 35 Remarks: The exact duration of neuromuscular blockade use in severe PARDS patients has not been determined to date. Most of the adult RCT data and pediatric observational data support treatment for 24-48 h after ARDS onset Corticosteroids 44. We suggest against using intravenous hydrocortisone to treat children with septic shock if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). PICO 47 45. We suggest that either intravenous hydrocortisone or no hydrocortisone may be used if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are not able to restore hemodynamic stability (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). PICO 47 Endocrine and metabolic 46. We recommend against insulin therapy to maintain glucose target at or below 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). PICO 52/60 47. We were unable to issue a recommendation regarding what blood glucose range to target for children with septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction. PICO 52/6048. We were unable to issue a recommendation as to whether to target normal blood calcium levels in children with septic shock or sepsisassociated organ dysfunction.PICO 62   49. We suggest against the routine use of levothyroxine in children with septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in a sick euthyroid state (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). PICO 63S5450. We suggest either antipyretic therapy or a permissive approach to fever in children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction (weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).
