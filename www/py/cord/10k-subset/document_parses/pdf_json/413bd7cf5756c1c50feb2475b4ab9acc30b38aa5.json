Thus, there is a need for more information which can help us to better understand the response of the lungs to surfactant replacement therapy. In this case report we provide new information on the effect of instilled surfactant in a patient with lifethreatening ARDS caused by viral pneumonia by using quantitative analysis of computed tomography (CT) of the lung. A 3- year-old boy was admitted to our intensive care unit for weaning from ventilatory support. His diagnosis was croup and ARDS caused by pneumonia. We supported spontaneous breathing activity by biphasic positive airway pressure ventilation (BIPAP), because this mode allowed unrestrained spontaneous breathing in a continuous positive airway pressure system at different pressure levels [3] . On the following day, blood gas values were worse and chest X-ray showed deterioration, requiring increased ventilatory support. CT performed the next day showed atelectasis and underexpanded areas and infiltrates in the right and left lung (Table 1, day 3) . To reduce ventilation-perfusion inequality, we decided to rotate the boy from the supine to the prone position every 12h. Two days later CT showed no reduction in atelectasis or in underexpanded areas or infiltrates (Table 1, day 5).",

In an attempt to prevent this complication, with the boy in the prone position, we instilled 3 g of a modified natural surfactant (Curosurf, Chiesi Farmaceutici, Parma, Italy, 200 mg/kg body weight, suspended in 37.5 ml saline) into the five lung lobes via fiberoptic bronchoscope. One hour after surfactant replacement therapy gas exchange and dynamic lung compliance were basically the same. However, when the boy was rotated to the supine position, a lasting improvement in gas exchange was found.

This reduction occurred in favour of poorly and normally inflated lung areas when compared to CT the day before. Similar results with even more pronounced reductions in non-inflated lung areas were found with CT between lung apex and carina (55 to 21%), at carina level (57 to 21%), and right above the diaphragm (55 to 15%). This finding, in conjunction with the improvement in gas exchange at constant ventilator settings, indicates that surfactant administration helped to restore impaired gas exchange in our patient by the recruitment of atelectatic and underexpanded alveoli. Improvement in lung volume within 2 h of surfactant administration has been reported for preterm infants [5] .",
