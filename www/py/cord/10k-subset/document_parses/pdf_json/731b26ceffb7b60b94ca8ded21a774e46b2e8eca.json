I will review a bit of the history of GFP and show how having a genetically-encoded marker that can be visualized in living tissues and does not require additional cofactors continues to inform the research in my own laboratory on the development and differentiation of touch-sensing neurons in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. A short list of uses in just our lab includes the use of GFP in promoter and protein fusions to 1) characterize spatial and temporal gene expression patterns; 2) characterize the subcellular distribution of proteins; 3) identify mutations affecting specific cells or processes; 4) label cells so they can be identified in culture or isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting; 5) label cells for electrophysiological characterization; and 6) develop additional biological methods. The development of GFP as a biological marker is a particularly good example of the importance of basic research on non-traditional organisms.",

We have developed new techniques for looking at helical polymers in electron cryomicroscopy, surmounting the problems caused by structural variability and heterogeneity. Applications of these methods to actin filaments, bacterial plasmid segregation protein ParM, bacterial and archaeal pili, and bacterial flagellar filaments shows how relatively conserved building blocks (protein monomers) can form dramatically different quaternary structures (polymers). This suggests that small changes in sequence, with relatively little impact on tertiary structure, can be greatly amplified by large changes in quaternary structure. The large changes in quaternary structure provide a mechanism for the evolutionary divergence of organisms that has not been fully appreciated.",

Perinatal hypoxiaischemia can disrupt synaptic function leading to accumulation of extracellular glutamate with subsequent excitotoxicity linked to cellular Ca 2+ overload and neuronal death. Since we previously demonstrated that P2X7 activation can induce neuronal glutamate release by exocytosis and through P2X7 itself, here we teste if neuronal and glial P2X7 activity could be associated to short-and long-term effects of perinatal hypoxia. Experiments were performed measuring intracellular calcium [Ca 2+ ] i dynamic and [3H]D-aspartate ([3H]D-ASP) release in synaptosomes and gliosomes from rats born by natural birth or caesarean delivery followed by global anoxia. The data show that perinatal anoxia significantly influenced the functionality of P2X7 receptor, whereas did not affect the depolarising agents (4-aminopyridine and ext. high K + ) action. In glial particles it decreased the Ca 2+ influx induced by the synthetic P2X7 selective agonist BzATP and enhanced the [3H]D-ASP release in both early phase and in adulthood. Instead, only in adult synaptosomes the BzATPevoked [Ca 2+ ] i level decreased, while [3H]D-ASP release was increased. This work is supported by Mariani Foundation, Milan (Italy).

Here we show first results of our attempt to reconstitute a functional fluorescently tagged Interleukin-4 receptor (IL4R) signaling complex at the plasma membrane. The IL4R type I consists of the IL4R alpha chain (IL4Ra) bound by JAK1 and the co-receptor IL2R gamma chain (IL2Rg, common gamma chain) bound by JAK3. In agreement with literature, we see that cytoplasmic fractions of JAK3 do not exchange with receptor bound fractions as shown by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). In addition, co-expression of JAK3 and IL2Rg leads to aggregation phenomena at the plasma membrane as indicated by the occurrence of fluorescent speckles. We further characterized the aggregation behavior of JAK3-EGFP, and mutants thereof, with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) in the cytoplasm. The biophysical data are discussed with respect to downstream signaling. For this we studied IL4-induced and JAK3-mediated target gene activation with a Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 6 (STAT6) -responsive luciferase assay.",

Association of LFA-1 into specific cholesterol enriched microdomains, called lipid rafts, is thought to regulate its activity. These 20 to 200 nm lipid rafts are abundantly present. However, these length-scales are not available for conventional light microscopy, showing the need for high resolution techniques. Near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) is a shearforce based scanning probe technique that uses a sub-wavelength aperture probe to locally excite fluorophores. Here, we have used two-colour excitation/detection NSOM, with a resolution below 100 nm, in aqueous conditions to map with nm accuracy the LFA-1 association with lipid-rafts on cell membranes. High resolution NSOM imaging showed that LFA-1 and raft markers are pre-organised in different but 50-100 nm proximal nanocompartments. This well-defined pre-assembling of lipids and receptors might constitute a prominent mechanism exploited by the cell to rapidly and efficiently aggregate distinct nano-domains into larger functional cell surface assemblies.",

            "text": "According to the classical model ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases form homo-and heterodimers upon ligand stimulation leading to their activation and cell proliferation. However, it has recently been shown that dimers and larger clusters of both ErbB1 and ErbB2 are present even in the absence of stimulation. In the present study we used the FRETsensitized acceptor bleaching (FSAB) technique to quantitate the ratio of ErbB1 and ErbB2 in heteroclusters. In this method a photostable donor excites a photolabile acceptor by FRET, and the acceptors within FRET distance to the donor will get photobleached and the fraction of acceptor molecules in the vicinity of donors can be determined. During prolonged excitation of the donor the FRET efficiency decreased to zero long before all of the acceptors were bleached indicating that only a fraction of acceptors is in the vicinity of donors. In quiescent cells 40% of ErbB1 colocalizes with ErbB2 in large-scale clusters, while 10% of ErbB2 coclusters with ErbB1. Upon EGF (ligand of ErbB1) stimulation the fraction of ErbB2 forming heterocluster with ErbB1 increased, while that of ErbB1 forming heterocluster with ErbB2 decreased. The fraction of ErbB1 and ErbB2 in heteroclusters was independent of the expression level of the receptors. In contrast, the FRET efficiency depended on the donor and acceptor ratio as expected. The FSAB technique can be used to quantitate the composition of large-scale protein clusters.

Because these two structures contain large amounts of DNA, proteins or RNA in comparison to bulk euchromatin, they should be densely crowded at the molecular level. In vitro, crowded microenvironments have been shown to alter protein behavior by inducing volume exclusion, slowing down diffusion and enhancing association, but whether these effects are relevant in vivo remains unclear. We probed the behavior of fluorescently labeled inert tracers and chromatin interacting proteins in heterochromatin and nucleoli in comparison to euchromatin. We establish that size-dependent volume exclusion and hindering of diffusion occurs in dense nuclear compartments. In addition, we determine that binding of three generic chromatin-interacting proteins is enhanced in heterochromatin compared to euchromatin. Finally, we show that these effects of nuclear crowding are best explained by a fractal model of chromatin organization, which allows us to derive a set of chromatin structural parameters that provide a comprehensive framework to predict nuclear protein dynamics. Taken together our results show that fractal crowding has a key role in determining nuclear protein dynamics.",

The acetylated chromatin fibers were easier to be spread out of the nuclei by a high-salt treatment, implying that hyper-acetylation facilitates the release of chromatin fibers from the compact heterochromatin regions. Chromatin fibers reconstituted in vitro from core histones and linker histone H1 became thinner upon acetylation. In the AFM images, the gyration radius of the nucleosomal fiber became larger after acetylation, suggesting that the acetylation increases long-range repulsive interactions between nucleosomes. Based on these data, we consider a simple coarse grained model, which explains that acetylation of histone-tails induces chromatin de-compaction by altering the electric charge distribution in nucleosomes.",

In the first step, the gate-DNA binds to gyrase, is cleaved, and a covalent DNA-gyrase complex is formed. A second DNA segment, the transfer-DNA, is passed through the gap, and the gate-DNA is re-ligated. Strand passage requires opening of a transient protein interface at the cleavage site, the so-called DNAgate, by \u223c2 nm. The intermediate cleavage complex presents an inherent danger of DNA breaks and genome instability. Cleavage complexes have consistently been detected in very low amounts, but a recent study predicted frequent opening of the topoisomerase II DNA-gate. We present a single molecule FRET study that monitors both the conformation of DNA bound to the DNA-gate of gyrase, and the conformation of the DNA-gate itself. DNA bound to gyrase adopts two conformations, one slightly, one severely distorted from B-DNA geometry. Distortion requires cleavage, but not ATP or a transfer-DNA. The DNA-gate of gyrase is mainly in the closed conformation, in agreement with <5% of cleavage complexes in equilibrium. Importantly, gyrase with an open DNA-gate is also scarcely populated during the relaxation and supercoiling reactions. Presumably, distortion of the gate-DNA unlatches the DNA-gate, and prepares it for transient release by the transfer-DNA, thus providing a strict coupling of gate-opening to strand passage.",

We observe transient opening ('breathing') of one linker DNA end from the histone core; without histone tail -DNA interactions, both linker DNA arms breathe with increasing frequency. Similar events were seen by others in single molecule fluorescence on immobilized nucleosomes, and by ourselves in free solution single molecule FRET. A larger-scale Brownian dynamics model, in which DNA is viewed as a wormlike chain and the histone core as a cylinder, serves to simulate DNA unrolling from the histone core. Comparison of the force-extension curves with experiments yields a histone/DNA binding energy of 2.1 kT per base pair. The folding of chromatin in the nucleus and the diffusional transport of proteins is simulated in a discrete-lattice model. This is complemented by intranuclear mobility measurements of GFP mono-to tetramers; these penetrate the cell nucleus more or less homogeneously, however, the dependence of the diffusion coefficient on molecular mass is much higher than that free in solution. Thus, larger proteins 'feel' the chromatin network more strongly, producing anomalous diffusion behavior. Such mobility measurements lead to a 'mobility image' of the fluorescent marker in the cell.

It has been widely assumed that nucleosomes array forms a 30 nm fiber structure, and that the \u223c30 nm fiber is converted into one-step higher-order structure in interphase nuclei. In order to monitor the chromatin dynamics with nanometer-scale resolutions, we developed a chromatin reconstitution system where nucleosomes can be formed on long (\u223c100 kb) plasmids and the structural dynamics induced by the changes in chemical environment and the presence of chromosomal proteins can be analyzed. Wellspread beads-on-a-string fibers in 50 mM NaCl were converted to partial aggregations in 100 mM NaCl. Namely, the nucleosome-nucleosome interaction is strongly affected by the salt environment. When histone H1was added into the reconstituted nucleosome at the molar ratio of 1 against the core histone octamer, the fibers with 20\u223c30 nm width were formed. With tailless-octamars prepared by a mild treatment with trypsin, nucleosomes were efficiently reconstituted as with the case for intact octamars. However, salt-induced partial aggregation and H1-induced \u223c30 nm fibers could not be detected in the tailless samples. These results suggest that the histone-tail plays critical role for the higher-order assembly of the nucleosomes. In conclusion, our in vitro system provided clues for uncovering the underlying physical properties of chromatin formation.",

This approach facilitates the data analysis for a wide range of region of interest (ROI) sizes on a confocal laser scanning microscope. A data analysis program was written to allow for the simultaneous analysis of FRAP traces collected at various ROI sizes. This global analysis by linking common model parameters has several benefits: a) less stringent conditions with respect to the signal-to-noise ratio, b) higher model discrimination power, and c) the possibility for an intrinsic determination of an instrumental parameter obviating the need for an extrinsic calibration. Additionally, attention has been devoted to estimate the variance of the individual pixel values. This allows for a proper weighting in the global analysis approach.

Its effects, mediated mainly by TrkB receptor, are partially contrasting since BDNF can induce survival, growth, differentiation or cell death. This dichotomy can be ascribed to the differences between neuron types, to the activation of different pathways, or to the fine regulation of its local availability. In this work we show a novel application of optical tweezers for localized delivery and stimulation of neurons and discuss the experimental results obtained so far. We use 1.5 \u00b5m diameter silica beads functionalized with BDNF to stimulate precise domains of hippocampal rat neurons and transporte them to the site of stimulation by means of optical tweezers. We demonstrate that BDNF bound to the beads preserves its biological activity and is able to induce the translocation of the transcription factor c-Fos, which is downstream to TrkB pathway, to the nucleus. Moreover, stimulation with BDNF-coated beads of pyramidal neurons can lead to the localized increase of calcium levels in dendrites.

The Ca 2+ transport of the Ca 2+ -ATPase is associated with a proton countertransport from the SR to the cytoplasm. Binding of the protons is thought to take place at acidic residues in the binding sites. The protonation of acidic ligands were analyzed in different enzyme states of the Ca 2+ -ATPase by multiconformation continuum electrostatic calculations. Glu 771 , Asp 800 and Glu 908 are prime candidates for the proton countertransporting residues and are likely to receive and release their proton via the same path. The Glu 309 instead might serve as a proton shuttle between Ca 2+ binding site I and the cytoplasm. The reaction cycle of P-Type ATPases is physiologically initiated by the binding and hydrolysis of ATP but can also be induced experimentally by voltage jumps across the membrane. We simulated the applied electric field by an \"ionic capacitor\" and studied the impact on different enzyme states of the Ca 2+ -ATPase and the Na + /K + -ATPase by a combination of MCCE and MD.

We will discuss lens-based fluorescence microscopy concepts that feature a resolving power on the nanoscale. All these concepts share a common basis: exploiting selected (pairs of) states and transitions of the fluorescent marker to neutralize the limiting role of diffraction. Specifically, the fluorophore is switched on and off, that is, between a bright and a dark state, to detect the emission of adjacent features sequentially in time. The first viable concept of this kind was Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy in which the fluorescence ability of the dye is switched off by stimulated emission. In the STED microscope, the extent of the region in which the molecule is able to fluoresce follows d \u2248 \u03bb/ 2 n sin \u03b1 1 + I/I s , meaning that fluorophores that are further away than d can be separated. I is the intensity that drives a fluorophore from the bright fluorescent state to the dark ground state by stimulated emission. I s depends (inversely) on the lifetime of the states. For I/I s \u2192 \u221e, it follows that d \u2192 0, meaning that the resolution can be molecular).

Bacteriophage \u03d529 packages its 6.6 mm long double-stranded DNA into a 42 nm dia. x 54 nm high capsid using a multimeric ring motor that belongs to the ASCE (Additional Strand, Conserved E) superfamily of ATPases. A number of fundamental questions remain as to the coordination of the various subunits in these multimeric rings. The portal motor in bacteriophage phi29 is ideal to investigate these questions and is a remarkable machine that must overcome entropic, electrostatic, and DNA bending energies to package its genome to near-crystalline density inside the capsid. Using optical tweezers, we find that this motor can work against loads of up to \u223c55 picoNewtons on average, making it one of the strongest molecular motors ever reported. We establish the force-velocity relationship of the motor. Interestingly, the packaging rate decreases as the prohead fills, indicating that an internal pressure builds up due to DNA compression attaining the value of \u223c6 MegaPascals at the end of the packaging. We show that the chemical energy of ATP is converted into mechanical work during phosphate release. Using ultra-high resolution optical tweezers, we determined the step size of the motor and established the coordination of the polymerases around the ring. We propose a comprehensive model of the operation of this motor.",

This infrastructure was first developed on the ID09B time-resolved X-ray beamline at the European Synchrotron and Radiation Facility, and more recently at the ID14B BioCARS beamline at the Advanced Photon Source. In studies of ligand-binding heme proteins, a picosecond laser pulse first photolyzes CO from the heme, then a suitably delayed picosecond X-ray pulse passes through the protein and the scattered X-rays are imaged on a 2D detector. When the sample is a protein crystal, this \"pump-probe\" approach recovers time-resolved diffraction \"snapshots\" whose corresponding electron density maps can be stitched together into movies that unveil the correlated protein motions that accompany and/or mediate ligand migration within the hydrophobic interior of the protein. When the sample is a protein solution, we recover timeresolved small-and wide-angle X-ray scattering patterns that are sensitive to changes in the size, shape, and structure of the protein. Scattering studies of proteins in solution unveil structural dynamics without the constraints imposed by crystal contacts; thus, these scattering \"fingerprints\" complement results obtained from diffraction studies. This research was supported in part by the Intramural Research Program of the NIH, NIDDK DC-SIGN is a trans-membrane protein expressed on antigen presenting cells and recognizes pathogens like HIV-1, Hepatitis C virus and Ebola. By electron microscopy and near-field optical nanoscopy, we demonstrated that at the plasma membrane DC-SIGN is organized in well-defined nanodomains of 100-180 nm in diameter. Intensity-size correlation analysis revealed remarkable heterogeneity in the nanodomains molecular packing density. We constructed and characterized several DC-SIGN mutated forms lacking specific molecular domains. By immunogold labeling and spatial point pattern analysis, we show that the extracellular neck domain is essential for DC-SIGN nanoclustering. Finally, we present a model that describes the probability of a cell to have a certain number of receptors joining the contact site in the initial encounter with an external object. Monte Carlo simulations subsequently define the parameters that are determinant in the object-cell encounter. Our results show that receptor nanoclustering is of particular importance for binding objects of sizes comparable to the nanocluster size, indicating that the nanoscale spatial organization of DC-SIGN is optimized for binding to virus-sized objects.",

Using a novel recording scheme for \"Thinning Out Clusters while Conserving Stoichiometry of Labeling\" 1 , molecular homo-association of GPI-anchored mGFP was detected at 37 \u2022 C and ascribed to specific enrichment in lipid platforms.

We used Micro-Electrode Arrays (MEAs) to study spontaneous and chemically evoked epileptiform activities in cortico-hippocampal brain slices obtained from wild-type (WT) and SynKO mice. 6-months old SynKO mice show sporadic ictal (IC) events in the entorhinal cortex. A potassium channel blocker, 4aminopyridine (4AP), elicits IC and inter-ictal (I-IC) events in both WT and SynKO slices. In the hippocampus of young SynKO (15-days old) mice, 4AP induces I-IC events at higher frequencies than in WT mice. Also the frequency of IC events, mainly observed in the cortex, is higher in SynKO. The analysis of adult (1-year old) mice, revealed a clear age-related aggravation, which paralleled the increase in the severity of the epileptic phenotype observed in vivo. Many slices from adult SynKO mice showed an IC event, while WT slices were refractory at this age to experience IC activity. SynKO mice are useful to study how neuronal network hyperexcitabilty due to mutations in SV proteins leads to the development of epileptiform activity.

Our method measures the time a particle takes to go from one location to another by correlating the intensity fluctuations at specific points on a grid independently on how many particles are in the imaging field.

The width of the resonance peaks were considerably more increased by Bax-C, in the presence of phosphatidylglycerol. Bax-C substantially decreased the T 1 relaxation times of phosphatidylglycerol and those of phosphatidylcholine when mixtured with phosphatidylglycerol but they were not decreased when phosphatidylcholine was the only phospholipid present in the membrane. 13 C-MAS-NMR showed that T 1 values were decreased when Bax-C was incorporated and, when phosphatidylglycerol was also present, the decrease in T 1 affected considerably more to some carbons in the polar region. These results indicate that Bax-C interacts differently with the polar part of the membrane depending on whether phosphatidylglycerol is present or not, suggesting that an electrostatic interaction of Bax-C with the membrane determines the membrane disposition of this domain.

Since this peptide has aromatic residues, fluorescence spectroscopy techniques were used with no need for attached probes. Results showed no significant interaction with both zwitterionic fluid phase and cholesterol-enriched membranes; however extensive partition to fluid phase cationic membranes were observed. In the DPPC gel phase, however, an adsorption at the surface of these membranes was detected by using a differential quenching approach with lipophilic probes, as well as by FRET. Moreover, the interaction with gel phase membranes seems to be specific towards PC vesicles, since no significant interaction was retrieved for membranes composed by shingomyelin and ceramide. Besides fluorescence, atomic force microscopy and zeta-potential were used to further investigate this issue. Our results show a selectivity and specificity of the peptide towards rigid domains, where most of the receptors are found, and help explain the importance of the interaction with membranes in the improved efficacy of sifuvirtide compared to other fusion inhibitors, by providing a local increased concentration of the peptide near the fusion site on both cellular and viral membranes.",

At high intensities, the focused beam of a femtosecond laser has been used to irradiate specific locations inside a cell, often beneath the cell membrane, exploiting the inherent penetration and localized absorption that comes from the multiphoton absorption physics. This has been applied in photobleaching, photouncaging, laser surgery and other experiments where the light is used not merely for observation but is instead an integral tool to interact with the dynamics of cells, to probe and perturb the cell condition. In this talk I will discuss biological and mechanical effects that can be generated by short exposures to femtosecond laser irradiation, such as calcium waves, membrane hyperpolarization, and cell contraction. This talk will concentrate on the changes in membrane potential that can occur when the cell is subjected to focused femtosecond laser beams. Both depolarization and hyperpolarization of the membrane potential could be evoked, depending on the laser parameters and on the position of the laser focus. These results have implications for the use of laser beams in microscopy, optical gene transfection, and laser nanosurgery. In a recent study we showed that the melting behavior of Supported Lipid Bilayers (SLBs) on mica can be influenced by the solution ionic strength and by the SLB preparation temperature [1] . By changing these parameters we could control the coupling between the two bilayer leaflets obtaining a coupled or decoupled melting behavior. Thus, we could provide evidence that the SLB model system is also suited for the study of lipid/protein interactions which had been questioned in the past. Then we investigated the mutual interactions between the membrane lipids (POPE:POPG 3:1) and the KcsA potassium ion channel by studying KcsA proteins reconstituted in SLBs. In particular, we studied the melting behavior of the SLB and the ion channel distribution relative to the different membrane phases by temperature controlled atomic force microscopy (AFM). By decreasing the temperature we found that the proteins underwent diffusion so to be excluded from the growing solid ordered regions. Further, the ion channels tended to accumulate at the domain boundaries or they aggregated in the liquid disordered phase. Both effects have been suggested to affect protein function. When we started from a low temperature at which the membrane was mainly in the solid ordered phase the membrane melting processes started in the vicinity of the included ion channels. We report fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) measurements performed at variable spot radius for T7-EGFP-hMOP receptors on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells in the presence of ligands. Two different agonists, DAMGO and morphine, caused markedly different changes to receptor diffusion as compared to the basal state. Like receptors in the absence of ligand, receptors bound to morphine exhibited diffusion confined to joint semi-permeable domains, but with smaller domain size and diffusion coefficient. This effect was inhibited by pertussis toxin, suggesting that this dynamic behaviour is associated with early steps of signaling. In the presence of DAMGO, half of the receptors displayed free long-range diffusion and the other half were confined to smaller isolated domains. Hypertonic sucrose buffer suppressed this effect which we attribute to receptor entry into clathrin-coated pits. It is likely that the observation of distinct receptor dynamics in the presence of DAMGO and morphine involves the agonist-selective phosphorylation of the receptor.",

The most fascinating and least understood is the interplay between non-histone chromatin protein HMGB1 and a linker histone H1. It is known that both H1 and HMGB1 bind the linker region of the DNA in vivo. However it is still a matter of debate as to whether these proteins assist each other or compete upon binding. The main attention in this work is paid to the investigation of the interactions between the HMGB1 and H1 proteins in physiological environment. Using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy we have studied the interactions between HMGB1 and H1 at various HMGB1/H1 ratios (R). It has been shown that there is a CDdetectable interaction between the proteins H1 and HMGB1 at R < 1. We have demonstrated that the interaction between these proteins results in changes of their secondary structure. CD indicates that the structural impact of the unordered fragments decreases while the net \u03b1-helicity of the proteins increases upon the interaction. We have also shown that large higher order structures are formed in solution. In this work we have also discussed the DNA-binding properties of the HMGB1 and H1 proteins.

Data regarding the structure of the HMGB-proteins obtained so far are rather different. Thermodynamic experiments reveal predominant \u03b1-helical structure of the proteins only at temperatures below +5 \u2022 C, i.e. under physiological conditions they are mainly disordered. Despite a lot of experimental data biological role of HMGB1 still remains unclear. It is believed that the proteins perform structural functions in chromatin and participate in various regulatory processes in cell. Using circular dichroism spectroscopy and DNA melting analysis we have shown that HMGB1 changes its structure upon binding to DNA. It was shown that at room temperature only about 25% of amino acid residues form \u03b1-helices, while in DNA-HMGB1complex the degree of the \u03b1-helicity of the protein increases to approximately 50%. Based on the data obtained we estimate the size of HMGB1 binding site as 80-100 b.p. We have also demonstrated that despite of strong DNA-bending properties of HMGB1 its binding to DNA results in increase of the double helix termostability.

This combination of techniques was used to overcome limitations of UV-CD spectroscopy due to considerable light scattering in such solutions. Based on the analysis of FTIR and UV circular dichroism spectra and AFM data the interaction of DNA with highmobility group non-histone chromatin protein HMGB1 and linker histone H1 was studied. It is believed, that HMGB-domain proteins perform both structural and regulatory functions in chromatin. However, the particular mechanisms of it functioning remain unclear/ Our data show that histone H1 facilitated binding of HMGB1 to DNA by interacting with the sugar-phosphate backbone and binding of Asp\\Glu amino acid residues of HMGB1. Acting together, HMGB1 and H1 stimulated the assemblage of supramolecular DNA-protein structures. The organization of the ternary complexes is modulated by the interactions between HMGB1 and H1 molecules. The DNA-proteins interactions in the presence of metal ions were different, causing prominent DNA compaction and formation of large intermolecular complexes.

In cancer, it is the failure of malignant cells to undergo apoptosis that is crucial. Using microplate fluorescence methods, we estimated kinetics of changes in mitochondrial transmembrane potential and caspase-3 activity in breast cancer cells MCF-7 treated with Pirolin or Pirolid. These features are connected with induction of apoptosis in some type of cancer cells. We observed steady-state increase in caspase-3 activity up to 12 h of postincubation that was followed by a decrease in the enzyme activity at 24 h. Caspase-3 activation was considerably greater in cells treated with Pirolid.

Although understanding their dynamic interactions with biomolecules, living cells and organisms is a prerequisite for their use as in situ sensors or actuators. While recent research has provided indications on the effect of size, shape, and surface properties of NPs on their internalization by living cells, the biochemical fate of NPs after internalization has been essentially unknown. Here we show that peptide-capped gold NPs enter mammalian cells by endocytosis. We demonstrate that the peptide layer is subsequently degraded within the endosomal compartments through peptide cleavage by the ubiquitous endosomal protease cathepsin L. Preservation of the peptide layer integrity and cytosolic delivery of NPs can be achieved by a combination of cathepsin inhibition and endosome disruption. This is demonstrated using a combination of distance-dependant fluorescence unquenching and photothermal heterodyne imaging. These results prove the potential of peptide-capped gold NPs as cellular biosensors.

One of the most limiting step in intravital microscopy is the preparation of the animal model and the number of animals to be sacrificed to get good statistics. Alternative routes must be searched. We employ TPLSM to explanted lymphnodes. Two photon excitation and a non descanned detection mode allow to increase, respectively, the excitation and detection efficiency while the explanted organs are kept very close to the condition they experience in live animals by means of an home-made temperature controlled box surrounding the microscope and a system for the flux of physiological fluids. Experiments performed on explanted lymphonodes, kept under constant flux of CO 2 -O 2 saturated buffers and at 36 o C, agree with literature for what concern T-cell homing and motility. This seems to confirm that T-cells behavior in explanted organs mantained in physiological conditions is very similar to that observed in live animals. We then believe that our TPLSM microscope would allow to study cell behaviors in in-vivo with high efficiency and a little technical effort.",

Oxidative damage, which was inflicted by exciting DNA-intercalated ethidium with focused green light, triggered recruitment of base excision repair enzymes. Surprisingly, an epigenetic regulator, heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) (Zarebski et al., 2009 ) was recruited to damage as well. HP1 is a constitutive component of heterochromatin, and plays an important role in transcriptional repression and regulation of euchromatic genes, however it was not known to be required for repair of oxidative damage. The finding of HP1 recruitment is particularly puzzling, since in another study HP1 was shown to dissociate from chromatin as a result of DNA damage (Ayoub et al. 2008) . Technical aspects of live cell imaging that may explain these contradictory results will be discussed. In this presentation, we report a method for determining both the presence and the stoichiometry of protein complexes at pixel resolution and apply it to disassembling focal adhesions. The method is derived from fluorescence fluctuation methods that have single molecule sensitivity and is based on our previously described N&B (Number and Brightness) method that measures the number and brightness (aggregation state) of fluorescent molecules in every pixel of a confocal microscope image. The new method exploits the correlation of fluorescence amplitude fluctuations for two colors and detects the presence of molecular complexes and their stoichiometry. While the original N&B method was developed for one color, i.e., a single molecular species, the new method, ccN&B, extends the analysis to two colors and introduces the concept of cross-variance. This method is similar in concept to the two-color PCH analysis. However, the covariancebased ccN&B method also generates pixel resolution maps of protein complexes and can be used on commercial confocal microscopes. The method is highly sensitive and has relatively high temporal resolution. We have applied this method to adhesion complexes in cells. In addition of their structural role, to link the extracellular substratum to actin filaments, they also serve as signaling centers that regulate many cellular processes including their own assembly and turnover, migration, gene expression, apoptosis, and proliferation.",

They assemble microdomains which can act as signaling platforms and confer charge and curvature to the membrane surface promoting electrostatic attraction and retention of proteins. Little is known about the mechanism(s) regulating membrane lipid remodeling during phagocytosis. Here we used fluorescently labeled biosensors based on K-ras and H-ras proteins to obtain spatio-temporal information on phagosomal membrane lipid remodeling during FcReceptormediated phagocytosis. The results show that cell activation by cytokines modulates the kinetics of anionic lipids thus affecting the membrane charge and the recruitment of cytosolic proteins to the phagosomal membrane. Our data emphasize the fundamental role of lipids in the generation and transduction of signals in phagocytosis, and we believe this can be extrapolated to many important processes in a cell.",

Although considerable heterogeneity was evident from cell to cell, on average, both intracellular concentration and mobility were found to be dependent upon culture medium. We also investigated bacteria expressing GFP under control of native promoters for involved in the regulation of the carbon metabolic cycle in Bacillus subtilis. The GFP concentration, which should be related to promoter activity, was investigated for single cells and cell populations under different metabolic conditions. Some photobleaching was observed during the course of the measurements as a decrease in the average fluorescence intensity. This is due to the small size of the bacteria (\u223c1 fL) and low basal expression levels of GFP (\u223c100 nM) in the absence of IPTG.

Syn is a protein associated with synaptic vesicles (SVs) that control SV trafficking and neurotransmitter release. The Syn mutations subject of this study are a non sense (ns-1) and of two missense (ms-2, ms-3) . Syn knockout (KO) hippocampal neurons were transfected with the either wild type (WT) or mutated Syns. All Syns presented a common punctate pattern of expression at the level of axonal arborizations but, while ns-1 Syn targeted to synapses as WT-Syn, ms-2 and ms-3 Syns reached the presynaptic terminal less efficiently. We next set up a live cell imaging experiment using synaptophysin-pHluorin and evaluated the effects of ns-1, ms-2 and ms-3 Syns on the size of SV pools. Restoring WT-Syn in Syn I KO terminals led to a increase of all SV pools. Restoring ms-2 and ms-3 Syns resulted in a phenotype not significatively different from Syn I KO background whereas restoring ns-1 Syn caused a decrease of all SV pools as compared either with WT-Syn or Syn I KO background. These data suggest an alteration in the subcellular distribution and function of Syn in patients carrying ms-2 e ms-3 mutation and a more severe effect on synaptic activity in patient carrying ns-1 mutation.",

Dendritic cells (DCs) can efficiently capture and take up HIV-1 through multiple attachment factors, such as the C-type lectin DC-SIGN. However, the initial interactions between HIV-1 and this receptor on DCs are not fully understood yet. In this work, we have used single-molecule EPI-TIRF microscopy in combination with fluorescently labelled HIV-1 virus like particles (VLPs) and DC-SIGN-specific antibodies to image the dynamic interaction between HIV-1 and DC-SIGN nanoclusters at the plasma membrane of DCs. By tracking individual trajectories of DC-SIGN on the cell surface of living DCs we have found heterogeneity in the modes of motion of DC-SIGN: some clusters are immobile whereas others move very quickly, with a few ones showing a directed motion on the cell membrane. To investigate how such motion might be correlated to DC-SIGN function as virus attachment factor, we have developed glass platforms functionalized with HIV-1 VLPs to locally stimulate living DCs. These virus platforms have allowed us to measure DC-SIGN diffusion rates and motion modes over the cell surface of stimulated DCs and represent a powerful tool for studying the dynamic interactions between HIV-1 and the DC membrane.",

Early research exposed two paradoxes: 1) during its intraerythrocytic cycle Pf permeabilizes the host cell so much that a comparably permeabilized healthy red blood cell (RBC) would lyse prematurely, and 2) Pf digests far more hemoglobin than needed for its metabolism. A model of the homeostasis of a Pf infected RBC suggested a common explanation of both puzzles: excess hemoglobin digestion is required to reduce the colloidosmotic pressure within the host cell thus ensuring its osmotic stability to the end of the Pf asexual cycle. We investigated these predictions with direct measurements of [Hb] and volumes of parasitized RBCs. Reliable volume and morphological data was obtained by confocal microscopy and quantitative surface reconstruction. Furthermore, we developed a new FRET-based method to measure hemoglobin molecular crowding by exploiting the reduction in fluorescence lifetime of a donor fluorophore loaded in the RBC cytosol. FRET imaging techniques are powerful tools for probing the biophysics of living cells. These tools provided a first validation of the colloidosmotic hypothesis and a deeper understanding of the homeostasis of the intraerythrocytic stage of Pf.",

Using a photoconvertible fluorescent protein, we determined that assembly was nucleated by membrane bound Gag molecules, while both membrane-bound and cytosol derived Gag polyproteins contributed to the growing bud.

In phase I, the number of Gag molecules at a budding site increases following a saturating exponential with a rate constant of \u223c 5 x 10 \u22123 s \u22121 . Hence, Gag assembly is complete in \u223c 200 s. In Phase II, a plateau in fluorescence intensity is observed with no exchange of Gag protein. The fluorescence intensity decays in phase III.

Yeasts cells are visualized using GFP fused to the associated repressor protein. We confirm earlier observations that telomeric sequences, i.e. located close to chromosome ends, accumulate at the nuclear periphery, whereas genes found midway along chromosome arms are mostly present in the nuclear lumen. The dynamics of these sequences is followed in 3D with an unpreceded temporal resolution of 10 ms, showing that chromosome dynamics is non linear in the short time regime and switches to a linear regime at larger timescales. Notably, this behavior is reminiscent of universal responses observed in polymer solutions, and is related to the confinement and the structure of chromosomes.

Rousso Department of Structural Biology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel Retrovirus budding is a key step in the virus replication cycle. Yet, despite substantial progress in the structural and biochemical characterization of retroviral budding, the underlying physical mechanism remains poorly understood, primarily due to technical limitations preventing visualization of bud formation in real time. Using atomic force-, fluorescence-and transmission electron microscopy we find that both HIV and Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) remodel the actin cytoskeleton of their host cells and utilize the forces it generates to drive their assembly and budding. Highly dynamic actin-filamentous structures which varied in size over the duration of budding appeared to emanate from the assembled virion. These actin structures assemble simultaneously or immediately after the beginning of budding, and disappear as soon as the nascent virus is released from the cell membrane. Analysis of sections of cryo-preserved virus infected cells by TEM reveals similar actin filaments structures emerging from every nascent virus. Substitution of the nucleocapsid domain implicated in actin binding by a leucine-zipper domain resulted in budding of virus-like particles that was not accompanied by remodeling of the cell's cytoskeleton. Notably, budding of viruses carrying the modified nucleocapsid domains was an order of magnitude slower than that of the wild type. The results of this study show that retroviruses utilize the cell cytoskeleton to expedite their assembly and budding.",

In a cell viscosity can play a role in several diffusion mediated processes, such as drug delivery and signalling. Previously, alterations in viscosity in cells and organs have been linked to malfunction; however, mapping viscosity on a single-cell scale remains a challenge. We have imaged viscosity inside individual cells using novel fluorescent probes, called molecular rotors, in which the speed of rotation about a sterically hindered bond is viscosity-dependent. 1, 2 This approach enabled us to demonstrate that viscosity distribution in a cell is highly heterogeneous and that the local microviscosity in hydrophobic cell domains can be up to 100\u00d7 higher than that of water. 1 We have also shown that the intracellular viscosity increases dramatically during light activated cancer treatment, called Photodynamic therapy (PDT). 2 We have demonstrated the effect of such viscosity increase on intracellular reactions by directly monitoring the rates of formation and decay of a short lived toxic intermediate, crucial in PDT, called singlet molecular oxygen, in light perturbed cells. Characean algae, close relatives of higher plants, represent a convenient model for studying the effect of propagating electrical signals, action potentials (AP) on photosynthesis. Illuminated Chara corallina cells produce coordinated spatial patterns of chlorophyll fluorescence (Chl Fl) and extracellular pH. Photosynthesis is higher in the cell regions adjacent to acid zones compared to alkaline zones. Under physiological conditions, the electrically induced AP differentially and reversibly suppresses photosynthesis in the alkaline and acid regions. In this work we examined the effects of an artificial PSI acceptor, methyl viologen (MV), on Chl Fl with Imaging-PAM technique. MV is a divalent cation and poorly permeates through biological membranes. The presence in the medium of MV had no effect on Fl as well as on P700 + absorbance signals until the application of a single excitatory stimulus. Once an AP was generated in the presence of MV, it induced irreversible inhibition of native (NADPdependent) electron flow and a strong non-photochemical Fl quenching all over the cell. This indicates that AP redirects electron flow from the main pathway to the artificial acceptor. We concluded that AP generation opens access for permeation of MV from the medium to the chloroplast stroma across two membrane barriers, plasmalemma and chloroplast inner membrane. We suggested that MV might enter Chara cell via plasmalemma Ca 2+ -channels activated during AP.",

The basis of the therapy is to administer a small amount of photosensitizer and sonosensitizer, which are selectively taken up by cancer cells, and then expose the body to light and ultrasound to activate these sensitizers. When the sensitizers absorb light of an appropriate wavelength, it may cause their excitation with subsequent energy transfer to oxygen; the oxygen then becomes highly reactive in cancer cells and produces reactive oxygen species (ROS). The resulting damage to organelles within malignant cells leads to tumor ablation. SDT uses an agent that is sensitive to ultrasound, allowing deeper penetration and destruction of abnormal cells. Changes in human melanoma cells were evaluated using fluorescence microscope and atomic force microscopy.We focused on obtaining pictures of the topography and pictures involving elastic properties of cell surface.

However, as neurons are known to exhibit complex temporal patterns of activity, fluctuations in signal intensity over time could be exploited to generate contrast in densely stained tissue. We demonstrate that the uniform calcium signals within individual neurons of the olfactory bulb can be exploited to visualize the morphology and projection patterns of these cells in tissue slices. As different neurons exhibit distinct time patterns, it is possible to generate a highcontrast multi-color visualization of the network's active neurons, solely based on the specificity of temporal fluctuations of a single-color calcium dye. It is thus possible to use other spectral channels for additional labelling, for example using cell-type or protein specific markers.

By using a redox-sensitive protein (rxYFP), employed ratiometrically, it is possible to generate high resolution redox maps of cells. The spatial distributions of oxidized and reduced elements have been discriminated in human embryonic kidney cells by the deconvolution of the histograms of redox maps. By transfecting cell with Glutaredoxin V (GRX-V), a significant shift towards more reduced state with respect to that recovered from non-transfected cells is observed. Despite such large differences, a common behaviour in the spatial distribution of reduced and oxidized couples can still be observed: oxidized population shows a pronounced localization on the cell borders, near the plasma membrane, while reduced population appears as a collection of well separated spots homogeneuosly distributed thoroughly the inner part of the cell with a mean dimension of 2 um. Furthermore we observe that the role of GRX-V consists in causing a shift towards reduced values of the highly reduced region, while leaving unaltered the redox-balance of the intracellular side of the plasma membrane. Fluorescence resonant energy transfer (FRET) is a popular approach to studying molecular interactions. Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) provides a robust read-out of FRET but has largely been restricted to fixed cells owing to relatively long acquisition times. We present a highspeed wide-field multidimensional fluorescence microscope for FLIM FRET in live cells on second timescales for high content analysis and studying fast dynamics. The system uses a Nipkow disc for optical sectioning and a time-gated image intensifier for wide-field FLIM. A spectrally selected supercontinuum excitation source facilitates versatile realtime FLIM of live cells transfected with fluorescent proteins. For cell signalling studies we have developed a multiplexed FRET approach. Ras activation at the plasma membrane is demonstrated using FLIM to read out TagRFP-Raf RBD interaction with mPlum-H-Ras. Simultaneously, a spectral ratiometric read-out is used for a second FRET (CFP/YFP Cameleon) probe to monitor the downstream calcium flux. To further develop multiplexed FRET as a tool for imaging multiple components of cell signalling networks, we are working to include polarisation-resolved imaging for steady-state and time resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements.",

Herten 1 1 BioQuant Institute,Heidelberg University, Germany, 2 School of Pharmacy, University of Queensland, Australia Application of single-molecule and high-resolution fluorescence methods to monitor gene expression in living cells increase the demand on novel probes and delivery methods.They require fluorophores with high photostability and quantum yield and highly-efficient delivery methods that ensure the minimum interference with cell processes such as metabolism and signal transduction. We used a novel class of dendrimers with varying generations and branching factors and different number of positive charges due to different moieties and functional groups.These different properties were tested for their efficiency to transfect eukaryotic cells with fluorescent oligonucleotides (ODNs).Different parameters (temperature,concentration of dendrimers, ratio of dendrimers and ODNs) were evaluated and optimised.We utilised these established optimal conditions to deliver a modified concept of SmartProbes to mammalian cells targeting mRNAs involved in signal pathways.We tested different mRNA targets and we optimised the fluorescence signal by varying a range of parameters,namely the fluorescent label and the intrinsic properties of the SmartProbe (length of the loop and stem, conformation and number of guanosines).In the near future,we plan to use these probes for monitoring gene expression levels using Diffusion Imaging Microscopy. We present a novel near-field scanning microwave microscope (SMM) capable of providing surface impedance measurements of samples with nanometric resolution. The instrument is the integration of a microwave Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) and a scanning probe microscope (AFM/STM).",

Consequently, the alternating bands along the myofibril are clearly visualized, therefore, enabling the determination of individual sarcomere lengths and the study of sarcomere length dynamics during macro-scale contractions.

Multidimensional imaging, in particular, is a growing application of confocal and other forms of fluorescence microscopy. It seeks to measure not only fluorescence intensity in three spatial dimensions, but also other features of fluorescence emission, such as lifetime and fluorescence spectra. Although multi-dimensional fluorescence microscopy has been demonstrated before, little attention has so far been paid to the problem of data interpretation and representation when dealing with such large datasets. We present here an instrument capable of recording fluorescence lifetime and excitation data by combining TCSPC for lifetime determination and a supercontinuum excitation source for extracting excitation spectra. These technologies permit the acquisition of 2D and 3D images with lifetime and excitation spectrum information at every pixel. We demonstrate a method whereby the multidimensional datasets acquired with this instrument are processed to yield biologically relevant parameters, (e.g. unmix fluorophores in a multiply labelled sample).

Saggau Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA Studying neural systems is complicated by the large number and small size of its cellular elements. The traditional way of exploring neuronal function by electrical monitoring with micropipettes is increasingly replaced by molecular imaging. Fluorescent molecules allow optical monitoring of neuronal signaling with cellular and often subcellular resolution. In addition to monitoring activity, analyzing the functional properties of individual neurons or neuronal populations requires their controlled activation. Optical approaches are well-suited, including molecular photolysis of inert precursors and light activation of engineered proteins that control ionic membrane currents. To fully utilize optical techniques for exploring neural systems requires more than adequate spatial resolution to distinguish neuronal elements and sufficient temporal resolution to induce and/or monitor neuronal signaling. Because of the non-linear and non-stationary nature of the studied system it is necessary to access many neuronal sites simultaneously. In modern imaging, wide-field illumination and imageformation are often replaced by patterned excitation and nonimaging photon collection. In many instants, diffractive illumination schemes can substitute for conventional reflective or refractive designs. In particular, the availability of programmable diffractive optical elements has made this an attractive alternative, since they permit highly versatile microscope designs and support a significant increase in the overall spatio-temporal resolution. I will present an advanced imaging approach using diffractive optical elements to analyze structure and function of live neurons in brain slices and intact cortex.",

Vereb Department of Biophysics and Cell Biology, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a powerful technique that can be applied to study nanoscale intra-and intermolecular events and interactions of molecules in situ in biological systems. A robust, easy to use, self-controlled FRET method, independent of donor and acceptor concentration and stochiometry, is acceptor photobleaching FRET, which requires only simple image mathematics. Another approach with more complicated calculations is the intensitybased ratiometric method, which is not based on destroying the acceptor fluorophores, making it applicable for following molecular interactions in live cells. As the need for using FRET in image cytometry for evaluating molecular interactions increases, we have undertaken to develop softwares for these methods involving the calculation and usage of all correction factors needed to obtain reliable energy transfer efficiencies. Correction possibilities of the acceptor photobleaching method include unwanted photobleaching of the donor, fluorescent photoproduct of the acceptor after photobleaching, cross-talk of unbleached acceptor into the donor channel and partial photobleaching of the acceptor. In the case of intensity-based ratiometric FRET, we can correct for all channel cross-talks and calibrate the FRET efficiency calculations.

Pendrin is an anion exchanger. The way it works and its role in different tissues, owing to the lack of known isoforms, is matter of wide research and debate. We focused on a still unexplored pendrin function, that is most important in the inner ear: cellular volume control and Cl \u2212 fluxes regulation. We used HEK cells over-expressing wild type pendrin or a mutated isoform together with the EYFP. We challenged cells with hypo-osmolar solutions and followed their volume variations in time. Taking advantage of the confocal optical sectioning we independently measured cell volume and fluorescence intensity. In this way, given the dependence of EYFP fluorescence from [Cl \u2212 ] and pH (measured with SNARF5) we could estimate at the same time Cl \u2212 fluxes, volume and pH variations. The contemporary measurements of the three variables, not yet reported in living cells, allowed to assess the role of pendrin in volume regulation and evidenced its participation to Cl \u2212 fluxes as compared to the mutated isoform or controls. Particle tracking inside the cell largely benefits of the ability to spatially and temporally mark specific structures to follow their \"signalling\" over a \"dark\" background as made possible since the advent of the photo-activatable markers. In terms of spatial confinement of the photo-activation process, the use of multiphoton excitation provides several favourable aspects compared to single photon confocal microscopy in photomarking biological structures to be tracked: the confined excitation volumes, of the order of magnitude of subfemtoliter, due to the non-linear requirements provide a unique control of the excitation and consequently photoactivation in the 3D space. In this context photoactivation experiments can be used to assess quantitative information about the binding kinetics of a macromolecule expressed in different cellular compartments. In this work we extended to photoactivation procedures and models originally developed for the quantitative analysis of FRAP experiments and we evaluated, for different proteins of medical interest (Rac-paGFP), the diffusive behaviour in the cytoplasm and the binding kinetics at the large endosomes. The results are compared with standard photobleaching experiments, in order to evidence the gained sensitivity obtained with photo-activatable proteins.",

Kawabata Division of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science, Hokkaido University, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Japan Stress fibers, which are contractile actin cables aligned in a highly-ordered manner, are important for cell migration, mechanical support of plasma membranes and extracellular matrix organization. Although stress fibers are dynamically disassembled and assembled again in cells, it is poorly understood how actin filaments are organized into cables with highly-ordered alignment for stress fiber assembly. For investigation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics during actin cable formation, we performed time-lapse observation of actin cytoskeleton in lamella of living fibroblasts by using scanning probe microscopy (SPM). High-speed SPM observation revealed that motile plaques defined front-side ends of new actin cables and that preexisting mesh-form actin networks were remodeled into new actin cables. Directional order analysis of movement of plaques and pharmacological experiments clarified that plaques were driven by myosin-II-based retrograde actin flow, indicating that plaques are associated with actin cytoskeleton. Immunofluorescence experiments showed that plaques were localized on foci of vinculin, a component of cell-substratum adhesions, suggesting that plaques can bind to extracellular substrata via vinculin. Based on these results, we propose a model for actin cable formation that motile plaques initiate remodeling of preexisting actin networks into actin cables aligned in a direction of actin flow by associating with extracellular substrata. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a plant hormone regulating fundamental physiological functions in plants, such as response to abiotic stress. Recently, ABA was shown to be produced and released by human granulocytes, by insulin-producing rat insulinoma cells and by human and murine pancreatic \u03b2 cells. ABA autocrinally stimulates the functional activities specific for each cell type through a receptor-operated signal transduction pathway, sequentially involving a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive receptor/G-protein complex, cyclic AMP, CD38-produced cyclic ADP-ribose and intracellular calcium. Here, the ABA receptor on human granulocytes and on rat insulinoma cells is identified as the lanthionine synthetase C-like protein LANCL2. Co-expression of LANCL2 and CD38 in the human HeLa cell line reproduces the ABA-signaling pathway. The PTX-sensitive G protein coupled to LANCL2 is identified as G i by transfection of CD38 + /LANCL2 + HeLa with a chimeric G protein (G\u03b1 q/i ). Identification of the mammalian ABA receptor will enable the screening of synthetic ABA antagonists as prospective new anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic agents.",

Here, we propose a novel technique termed`functional mode analysis' that aims to detect the collective motion that is directly related to a particular protein function.

The functional quantity could, e.g., correspond to a geometric, electrostatic, or chemical observable, or any other variable that is relevant to the function of the protein. Two different correlation measures are applied. First, the Pearson correlation coefficient that measures linear correlation only; and second, the mutual information that can assess any kind of interdependence.

A new concept was adopted for estimating the optimum source neutrons energy appropriate for different circumstances of BNCT. Four postulations on the optimum source neutrons energy were worked out, almost entirely independent of the RBE values of the different dose components. Four corresponding conditions on the optimum source neutrons energy were deduced. An energy escalation study was carried out investigating 65 different source neutron energies, between 0.01 eV and 13.2 MeV. MCNP4B Monte Carlo neutron transport code was utilized to study the behavior of these neutrons in the brain. The deduced four conditions were applied to the results. A source neutron energy range of few electron volts (eV) to about 30 keV was estimated to be optimum for BNCT of brain tumors located at different depths in brain. The results were discussed.",

Marrink Groningen University, The Netherlands Bola-lipids consist of two monopolar, twin-tailed lipids that are held together by chemical linkage between one or both ends of the tails from one lipid and the corresponding ends from the other one. Membranes formed by these lipids or by their mixtures with monopolar lipids are known to have additional mechanical stability while retaining membrane fluidity. This is traditionally attributed to the fact that, in the membrane phase, the bola-lipids have predominantly spanning configuration (the two polar heads are positioned at opposite membrane-water interfaces) in detriment to looping configuration (both head groups are located in the same membrane-water interface). We perform molecular dynamics simulations, using the coarse grained MARTINI forcefield. We start with self-assembly simulations of bola-lipids followed by bilayer equilibration. An artificial pore is created in the membrane that significantly increases the flip-flop mobility of the lipids and hasten equilibration. The membrane properties are characterized (area per lipid, thickness, order parameter, pressure profile) with emphasis on the spanning/looping ratio. Our study can help designing new artificial membranes, with higher stability under extreme conditions.",

We observed several correlated transitions in the protonation states of the buried active-site cysteine and a neighboring lysine coupled to the exposure of the active-site thiolate. These results support the view of an internal proton shuffling mechanism during oxidation crucial for the uptake of two electrons from the substrate protein. Intramolecular disulfide-bond formation is probably steered by the conformational switch facilitating interaction with the active-site thiolate.

Fibrils display an abnormal content of Cu and Zn ions whose binding to A\u03b2-peptides has been recently studied by X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy [1] and interpreted in terms of ab initio simulations. In order to perform such simulations it is of the utmost importance to find a compromise between the need of having a realistic description of the actual physical system and the difficulty of dealing with too many atoms and electrons. What is usually done is removing solvent (water molecules), thus studying the system in the so called \"gasphase\". In this work we investigate the relevance of water in the Zn-A\u03b2 1\u221216 coordination mode. Relying on a combination of Classical [2] and Quantum Chemistry [3] methods we find a significant difference in the Zn coordination geometry depending on whether water is present or not. This information is exploited in building a full model system for subsequent Car-Parrinello simulations where two A\u03b2 peptides in water are in interaction in the presence of Zn. [ Although experiments which can directly probe the mechanical properties of proteins have only been performed recently, it is clear that the complex folds of polypeptide backbones lead to very heterogeneous mechanical behavior. This heterogeneity is likely to play an important role in protein function and interaction and it would be useful to be able to predict what mechanical (and dynamical) properties will result from a given structure. We have been using coarse-grain elastic network models to investigate this question and have found that these models are able to link specific mechanical properties to a number of functional features including enzymatic active sites, folding nuclei and changes in behavior due to point mutations. These models are also adapted to looking at complex formation between proteins and how specific recognition is achieved, while being fast enough to be applied to very large numbers of interactions.",

In principle, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can be used to refine protein model structures but it is limited by the currently accessible simulation time scales. We have used a recently developed biasing potential replica exchange (BP-Rex) MD method (Kannan, S. Zacharias, M. Proteins 2007, 66, 697-70) to refine homology modeled protein structure at atomic resolution including explicit solvent. In standard Rex-MD simulations several replicas of a system are run in parallel at different temperatures allowing exchanges at preset time intervals. In a BP-RexMD simulation replicas are controlled by various levels of a biasing potential to reduce the energy barriers associated with peptide backbone dihedral transitions. The method requires much fewer replicas for efficient sampling compared with standard temperature RexMD. BP-RexMD simulations on several test cases starting from decoy structures deviating significantly from the native structure resulted in final structures in much closer agreement with experiment compared to conventional MD simulations.",

This method, called Static Mode method, is based on the \"induced-fit\" concept and is aimed at mapping the intrinsic deformations of a biomolecule subject to any external excitations: direct mono or multi-site contact, electrical etc... The algorithm allows obtaining a set of deformations, each one corresponding to a specific interaction on a specific molecular site, in terms of force constants contained in the energy model. Such a process can be used to explore the properties of single molecular intrinsic flexibility, as well as to predict molecular docking or molecule/surface interactions. From a modelling point of view, the interaction problem can be expressed in terms of reactive sites between the interacting entities, the molecular deformations being extracted from the pre-calculated Static Modes of each separated ones. The first applications of our method have focused on the intrinsic flexibility of biomolecules like nucleic acids and proteins.

However, MBP also interacts with other proteins such as cytoskeletal and signalling proteins, adapting its structure to the different roles. MBP is a candidate autoantigen in the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis. This study investigated at atomic detail the conformation of a highly conserved central fragment of MBP, constisting of two consecutive regions with different relevant functionalities. The first one is associated with the membrane and comprises the primary immunodominant epitope in multiple sclerosis; the second one was predicted to be a ligand for SH3-domains of signalling proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations were perfomed in the presence of dodecylphosphocholine micelle, starting from a structure extrapolated from experimental data (Harauz and Libich, Curr. Protein Pept. Sci., 2009). The results confirm the experimetal hypothesis, showing, in the micelle, a stable alpha-helix anchored to the membrane for the first region and, for the proline-rich second one, a poly-proline type II helix pointing outwards, ready to interact with the signalling proteins.",

Our CG technique proves two orders of magnitude less demanding of computational resources than traditional AL methodology. A unique feature of our approach is that the CG potentials are directly compatible with standard AL models, thus facilitating the simulation of multiresolution systems, where the \"chemically-sensitive\" components (e.g., the solutes in membrane permeation studies) are modelled atomistically, while the surrounding environment is coarse-grained.

Here the multi-scale approaches are first briefly illustrated with a particular attention to the issue of matching the different resolutions, which is essential to achieve a coherent descripition. The focus is then fixed on the Coarse Grained (CG) models, typically spanning the nm-\u00b5m and \u00b5s-ms scale, and in particular on their minimalist -simplest and computationally cheapest -versions [1, 2] . A parameterization strategy that combines accuracy and predictive power within these models is presented here and applications are shown to relevant cases including the proteins involved in the HIV replication, the Green Fluorescent Proteins and examples of macromolecular complexes. [1] Controlled degradation of collagen is an important process in tissue remodeling and wound healing. Collagenase cleaves fibrillar collagens about three quarters of the distance from the amino-terminus. Even though the determination of the cleavage site and the collagenase structure took place decades ago, the mode of action of collagenase on collagen is not clear. To understand the mechanism of collagenase activity on collagen, the structure, stability and dynamics of collagen, its conformation around the cleavage site and the possibilities of conformational rearrangements between the two domains in collagenase was explored using MD simulation. The results of principal component (PCA) and normal mode (NM) analysis of the collagen and collagenase suggests that the C-terminal domain of collagenase recognizes the collagen, and then the N-terminal catalytic domain undergoes rearrangement on the substrate (with the help of linker regions). The SDA software for carrying out Brownian dynamics simulations of protein-protein diffusional association with the help of biochemical constraints is being used to predict the mode of interaction of collagen and collagenase. Different conformations obtained from PCA and NM analysis are being used for the docking. The predicted structures of the complex will help us to understand how collagenase recognizes and binds collagen specifically.

Marrink University of Groningen, The Netherlands Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) comprise a large family of peptides that include small cationic peptides, such as magainins, which permeabilize lipid membranes. Previous atomistic level simulations of magainin-H2 peptides show that they act by forming toroidal transmembrane pores. However, due to the atomistic level of description, these simulations were necessarily limited to small system sizes and sub-microsecond time scales. Here, we study the long-time relaxation properties of these pores by evolving the systems using a coarse-grain (CG) description. The disordered nature and the topology of the atomistic pores are maintained at the CG level. The peptides sample different orientations but at any given time, only a few peptides insert into the pore. Key states observed at the CG level are subsequently back-transformed to the atomistic level using a resolutionexchange protocol. The configurations sampled at the CG level are stable in the atomistic simulation. The effect of helicity on pore stability is investigated at the CG level and we find that partial helicity is required to form stable pores. We also show that the current CG scheme can be used to study spontaneous poration by magainin-H2 peptides. Over-all, our simulations provide a multi-scale view of a fundamental biophysical membrane process involving a complex interplay between peptides and lipids. The Varkud Satellite (VS) ribozyme is the largest of the nucleolytic ribozymes, and the only one for which there is no crystal structure. We have determined the overall architecture of the complete VS ribozyme using small-angle X-ray scattering in solution. The substrate stem-loop docks into the tertiary fold of the ribozyme, allowing an intimate loop-loop interaction to occur. This brings two key nucleobases A756 and G638 into close proximity of the scissile phosphate, and we believe that these nucleobases are involved in general acid-base catalysis of the phosphoryl transfer reactions. This is supported by functional group substitution, and the pH dependence of the reaction rate for the natural and modified RNA. Although possessing totally different folds, the functional elements of the VS and hairpin ribozymes are topologically and mechanistically very similar if not identical. This has probably arisen by convergent evolution. Other nucleolytic ribozymes have diversified to employ hydrated metal ions and even small molecules to participate in genera acid-base catalysis. By contrast, the larger ribozymes seem to have adopted a different, metalloenzyme, catalytic strategy. Why these different groups have evolved different catalytic chemistries is an interesting challenge to our understanding of biocatalysis.",

Lawrence Pharmaceutical Science Division, King's College London, UK The biggest obstacle for the success of gene therapy is delivery. With the discovery of RNAi, the use of siRNA to regulate gene expression as potential therapy has attracted much attention recently. In contrast to DNA, siRNA delivery does not require nuclear entry. With one less barrier to overcome, the delivery of siRNA seems to be easier. It is frequently assumed that comparable delivery strategy could be used for both DNA and siRNA. In fact the two types of nucleic acids are fundamentally different with distinct properties, which impact their delivery strategies. In the present study it was found that most non-viral delivery vectors including polymers, peptides and lipids were generally more efficient in binding with DNA than siRNA as shown in gel retardation assay. The inferior siRNA binding is possibly due to the rigid structure of siRNA, resulting in weaker electrostatic interaction with the cationic vectors. Surprisingly, it was observed that all the vectors studied offered better nuclease protection for siRNA than DNA despite poorer siRNA binding. Either the nuclease protection for siRNA is easier to achieve due to its small size, or the gel retardation assay did not truly reflect the binding efficiency as the weaker siRNA complexes may dissociate during electrophoresis. Not only the delivery strategy, the results between DNA and siRNA study must also be carefully adapted and interpreted.",

Major conformational changes are expected to take place during spliceosomal assembly and catalysis. We have developed a single-molecule fluorescence assay to study the structural dynamics of a protein-free U2-U6 complex from yeast. Our previous data have revealed a 2-step large amplitude conformational change of the U2-U6 complex. The 1 st step is a Mg 2+ -induced conformational change where helix III and the U6-ISL are in close proximity in low Mg 2+ and separated in high Mg 2+ . The 2 nd step corresponds to the formation of the highly conserved helix IB. We now examine the role of the highly conserved bases in the folding dynamics of the U2-U6 complex. The data show that U80 and the ACAGAG loop play an important role in stabilizing the interaction between helix III and the U6-ISL. We hypothesize that U80 flips out of the U6-ISL and interacts with the ACAGAG loop to bring them in close proximity. Our results raise the interesting possibility that this interaction plays an important role in bringing the 5' splice site and the branched A into close proximity of U80, which may be critical for catalysis.",

Ennifar IBMC -CNRS, Strasbourg, France All retroviral genomes consist in two homologous single stranded RNAs. HIV-1 Dimerization Initiation Site (DIS) is a conserved hairpin in the 5' non-coding region of the genomic RNA and essential for viral infectivity. The DIS initiates genome dimerization by forming a kissing-loop complex, further stabilized into an extended duplex upon interaction with the NCp7 nucleocapsid protein. X-ray structures of the DIS kissing-loop and extended duplex revealed similarities with the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA A-site, which is the target of aminoglycoside antibiotics. As a result, aminoglycosides also bind the HIV-1 DIS as shown by our X-ray structures of the DIS kissingloop bound to aminoglycosides. Using fluorescence, UVspectroscopy and microcalorimetry, we further characterized HIV-1 DIS/aminoglycosides interactions. We found that the affinity of aminoglycosides for the DIS was higher than for their natural target, the 16S A site. They strongly stabilize the DIS kissing-loop, blocking its conversion into the duplex form. Finally, we also solved X-ray structures of the DIS duplex bound to aminoglycosides, revealing an important conformational change following drug binding. These structures show that it is possible to target the HIV-1 DIS dimer before and after the NCp7-assisted RNA maturation with the same molecule. Altogether, our studies create the basis for a rationally driven design of novel potential drugs targeting the HIV-1 genome.",

The N-terminal domain exhibits nucleic acid chaperone properties similar to those of the nucleocapsid protein from HIV. Here, we characterized the mechanism of the chaperone properties of a peptide E corresponding to the BD2 and BD3 clusters of the N-terminal domain. To this end, we monitored the promotion by this peptide of the annealing of dTAR, the DNA analogue of the transactivation response element to its complementary sequence, cTAR DNA, taken as models. The annealing involves two second-order kinetic components that are activated by at least three orders of magnitude by peptide E. This activation was correlated with the ability of peptide E to destabilize the lower half of dTAR stem. Using, cTAR and dTAR mutants, the two kinetic components were assigned to two pathways which are connected with the fast annealing of the terminal bases of cTAR to dTAR and slow extended duplex formation, limited kinetically by the nucleation of central segments of cTAR and dTAR stems.",

Klostermeier 2 1 Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland, 2 Biozentrum, Univ. of Basel, Switzerland, 3 Univ. of Marburg, Germany DEAD box helicases couple ATP hydrolysis to RNA structural rearrangements. T. thermophilus Hera consists of a helicase core and a C-terminal extension (CTE) with a putative RNase P motif. Crystal structures show that the CTE is bipartite, forming a highly flexible dimerization motif with a novel fold and an additional RNA-binding module. We provide a first glimpse on the orientation of an RNA-binding domain outside the helicase core. In a structure-based model for the complete Hera dimer, the RNA-binding sites of the helicase cores face each other, allowing for inter-subunit communication. The plasticity of the dimerization motif allows for drastic changes in the juxtaposition of the helicase cores within the dimer. In single molecule FRET experiments we identified fragments of the 23S rRNA and RNase P RNA as substrates for Hera. Both substrates switch the Hera core to the closed conformation and stimulate the intrinsic ATPase activity. RNA binding is mediated by the CTE, but does not require the putative RNase P motif. ATP-dependent unwinding of a short helix in 23S rRNA suggests a specific role for Hera in ribosome assembly, in analogy to the E. coli and B. subtilis helicases DbpA and YxiN. In addition, the specificity of Hera for RNase P RNA may be required for RNase P RNA folding or RNase P assembly. Simultaneous action of two Hera subunits on the same RNA molecule may be important for efficient RNA remodeling in vivo.",

Turnip yellow mosaic virus possesses two such hairpins, HP1 and HP2. HP1, and in particular the presence of the C C and C A mismatches in its internal loop, is important for initiation of the encapsidation of the viral genome. The encapsidation occurs under acidic conditions at the neck of invaginations of the chloroplast membrane. We have now determined the 3D structures of revertants involved in the evolutionary pathway using NMR spectroscopy. These structures reveal how the grooves in the hairpin become increasingly positively charged in successive generations of evolution. The similarity between the CCCA mutant and the wild-type hairpin (HP1) is striking and explains why this mutant gives rise to a viable virus. In addition, a characteristic tilt of the backbone is observed upon occurrence of a protonated C C base pair. Both the positively charged major groove and the kink in the RNA backbone appear to be crucial for interactions with the viral capsid. At neutral pH, the structure of HP1 resembles the Watson-Crick base paired mutant which explains why encapsidation only occurs under acidic conditions.",

The studied hairpin ribozyme is a self-cleaving/ligating motif found in the minus strand of the satellite RNA associated with tobacco ringspot virus. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) was successfully used to detect sub-picomole quantities of nucleic acids. SERS takes advantage of the strongly increased Raman signals generated by local field enhancement near metallic (typically Au and Ag) nanostructures. SERS spectra of DNA or RNA are strongly dominated by Stockes modes of adenine. Through an interaction of adenyl residues with silver colloid, adenyl Raman signal is 10 6 times increased compared to Raman scattering. In controlled conditions, SERS signal is proportional to the amount of free residues adsorbed on the metal surface. Upon RNA cleavage, residues are unpaired and free to interact with metal. In the present study, we proposed to follow the cleavage reaction of hairpin ribozyme (HPR85) using the SERS signal of the liberate adenyl residues. As the SERS signal is proportional to the adenyl residues, reactivity of HR85 was monitored by measuring the Raman intensity of the fragment liberated during the cleavage of hairpin.

Tolstorukov 2 1 Institute of Radiophysics and Electronics NAS of Ukraine, 2 Harvard-Partners Center for Genetics and Genomics, USA Revealing the mechanisms of protein-DNA recognition is essential for understanding the regulation of many cellular processes. There is growing evidence that recognition through sequence-specific contacts (direct readout) can be enhanced by recognition via DNA sequence-dependent deformability (indirect readout). The role of changes in DNA accessible surface area (ASA) in distorted DNA configurations in complexes with proteins is not fully understood yet, even though such changes and related changes in polarity of DNA surface are among key factors of indirect readout. To fill this gap we have developed a publicly-available Internet database of protein-DNA complexes, which integrates the data on DNA conformational parameters with information on ASA of DNA atoms in the minor and major grooves, ProtNA-ASA. The database has been used to analyze the effect of changes in DNA backbone configuration on ASA of DNA atoms in major and minor grooves. We observe that sugar puckering and conformation of torsion angle \u03b3 affect the accessibility of DNA atoms in both grooves to a noticeable extent. We also report sequence specific preferences of the nucleotides for structural domains of \u03b3. These results can shed new light on the mechanisms of indirect protein-DNA recognition.",

The isotherm of adsorption of EtBr on DNA has linear form in Scatchard coordinates at low degrees of occupation. The comparison with experimental isotherm permits to estimate the parameters of EtBr binding with DNA. With taking into account the pseudo-ring structures formation with partially molten regions we consider two types of binding regions, linear and ring at low degrees of occupation. The isotherm of adsorption of EtBr on DNA and also variation of the number of bounded EtBr molecules are calculated with taking into account these two types of binding regions. It was shown that at low concentrations cis-DDP, bounding with DNA, changes the isotherm of ligands adsorption. The linear in Scathcard coordinates isotherm of adsorption transforms into non-linear isotherm. The degree of transformation depends on the fraction of DNA in the ring regions, on the ratio between number of EtBr binding cites in the ring and linear regions, and also on the binding constants for these regions.

NCp7 is required for efficient proviral DNA synthesis, by promoting the initiation of reverse transcription and the two obligatory strand transfers. Using fluorescence techniques as well as FCS and NMR, we investigated the chaperone properties of NCp7 on the primer binding sites (PBS) and transactivation response elements (TAR) sequences involved in the two obligatory strand transfers. We showed that NCp7 binds mainly to the (-)PBS loop, which results in an extension of the loop and a destabilization of the upper base pair of the stem. These structural changes chaperone a kissing complex with the complementary (+)PBS loop and its further conversion into an extended duplex. In contrast, the NCp7-promoted annealing of cTAR-TAR results from the destabilization of the bottom of cTAR stem, which favors the invasion of the TAR stem. By developing new fluorescence methodologies to site-specifically characterize these interactions, we further showed that NCp7 slows down the ps to ns conformational fluctuations of its nucleic acid targets and freezes the local mobility of the bases contacted by the zinc fingers.",

We have studied the characteristics of DNA in flow to probe its structure. Flow aligned Linear Dichroism (LD) is a technique that uses light polarised parallel and perpendicular to an orientated sample. It can be used to measure how aligned a sample is, and the orientation of any interacting molecules. To create this alignment, the sample is placed between two concentric cylinders where one is spun to create a shear flow. The longer and more rigid the molecule is the better the orientation and the signal. As the sample is in flow there are other factors than need to be considered when using LD. These include viscosity and temperature. There are many methods to measure the viscosity of a sample of DNA at varying temperatures. These include viscometer, rheometer and dynamic light scattering. The effects temperature has on viscosity and the sample itself need also to be considered.

We study the properties of this model using a Brownian dynamics algorithm that takes hydrodynamic interactions into account and obtain results that partially agree with experiments and predictions of kinetic models. For example, we show that the protein samples DNA by a combination of three-dimensional diffusion in the solvent and one-dimensional sliding along the DNA chain. This model evidences the presence, in a certain range of values of the effective protein charge, of facilitated diffusion, i.e. a combination of the two types of diffusion that leads to faster than 3-dimensional diffusion sampling of DNA. Moreover, the analysis of single sliding events shows that the number of base pairs visited during sliding is comparable to those deduced from single molecule experiments. In contrast to kinetic models, which predict an increase of the number of different base pairs visited by the protein proportional to the square root of time, our model however suggests that this number increases linearly with time until it reaches a value that is close to the total number of DNA base pairs in the cell (published in J.

We have shown previously that ionizing radiation destabilizes such DNA-protein complexes mainly through damage to the protein. For the typical lactose operator -repressor system we have shown by fluorescence measurement and mass spectrometry that upon irradiation, all the four tyrosine residues of the DNA binding domain (called headpiece) are oxidized into 3,4dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA). A circular dichroism study revealed a global conformational change and the destabilization of the headpiece. To decide which lesion is critical for the induction of these effects, a molecular dynamics simulation study was undertaken in parallel with a site-directed mutagenesis one. Each tyrosine residue of the headpiece was replaced by another amino-acid that mimics the damaged tyrosine. The most common amino-acid used in site-directed mutagenesis being alanine, we have replaced one tyrosine (7, 12, 17 or 47) in the NMR-based structure of the headpiece from PDB databank (1LQC) by an alanine. The conformational stability of each Tyr\u2192Ala mutant has been studied by Molecular Dynamics simulation (MD) and compared to that of the native sequence and of the different Tyr\u2192DOPA mutants.

Using a PCR-based SELEX procedure, we discovered that HMGA2 is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein and recognizes the following two sequences: 5'-ATATTCGCGAWWATT-3' and 5'ATATTGCGCAWWATT-3', where W is A or T. Using a double-label EMSA assay, we found that HMGA2 binds to AT-rich DNA as a monomer. Using isothermal-titrationcalorimetry, we demonstrated that HMGA2 binds to AT-rich DNA with very high binding affinity whereby the binding of HMGA2 to A-tracts is entropy-driven and to alternate AT sequences is enthalpy-driven. This is a typical example of enthalpy-entropy compensation in which the hydration difference between HMGA2-DNA complexes is a main reason for the compensation. Interestingly, the binding of HMGA2 to different AT-rich sequences is accompanied with a large negative heat capacity change indicating an important role of solvent displacement and charge-charge interaction in the linked folding/binding processes.",

Using this approach it is now possible to calculate the absolute values of the energy contributions of various physical factors to the DNA binding process, whose summation gives a value that is reasonably close to the experimentallymeasured Gibb's free energy of binding. Application of the methodology to binding of various aromatic drugs with DNA provides an answer to the question 'What forces are the main contributors to the stabilization of aromatic ligand-DNA complexes' ? We report the effects of 22 kHz ultrasound irradiation of double-stranded DNA solutions under conditions of transient cavitation. A new method was developed for studying these effects which is based on combination of two procedures: ultrasound irradiation of the solutions of double-stranded DNA fragments and subsequent analysis of the high resolution denaturing gel electrophoresis data. Statistical treatment of the data on the mobility of 3'-end-labelled restriction fragments with known sequence allowed us to discover the phenomenon of sequence specific ultrasonic cleavage of DNA. Our analysis results in the following conclusions: 1) all steps with 5'-ward cytosine [5'-d(CpN)-3'] have significantly higher cleavage rates than others; the intensity of cleavage diminishes in the order CpG > CpA \u2248 CpT > CpC; 2) the cleavage rates of all 16 steps depend on the type of flanking base pairs; 3) the cleavage rates of the complementary base pair steps are not identical. Thus, subtle sequence specific conformational and physical-chemical variations modulate the reaction of sugar-phosphate single bonds on the ultrasound exposure.",

Considering X as a basic ligand and Y as an added ligand, the change of the integral biological response of X in the presence of Y has been interpreted in terms of two mechanisms: the interceptor and protector action of Y on X. This mechanisms have been characterized by two criteria, R D and A D , reflecting the removal of X from DNA by Y (Biophys. Chem., 2008, Vol.132, pages 148-158 ) . In this work we develop the theory of the interceptor-protector action of a mixture of two biologically-active DNA-binding aromatic drugs. The theory is based on solution of a general system of mass balance equations in the three-component system X -Y -DNA with respect to the two factors, R D and A D . The outcome is a set of expressions enabling estimation of the change in biological response of X on addition of Y as a function of equilibrium parameters under different restrictions. The results are in good agreement with known in vitro data on Caffeine+Antibiotic action in leukemia cell lines. The influence of Mn 2+ ions on the structure of natural calf thymus DNA was studied by Raman spectroscopy. Measurements were done at room temperature and pH 6.2 \u00b1 0.2, in the presence of the physiological concentration of 150 mM Na + ions, and in the presence of Mn 2+ concentrations that varied between 0 and 600 mM. No condensation of DNA was observed. DNA backbone conformational changes were not detected in the whole concentration range of Mn 2+ ions as judging from the Raman spectra. No evidence for DNA melting was identified. Binding of manganese(II) ions to the charged phosphate groups of DNA, stabilizing the double helical structure, is indicated in the spectra. As judged from the marker band of dC near 785 cm \u22121 , altered nucleoside conformations in dC residues are supposed to occur, in the Mn 2+ concentration range of 400-600 mM. Binding of divalent ions to N7 of guanine and, possibly, in a lesser extent to adenine was observed as judging from the Raman marker bands at 1336, 1376, 1490 and 1578 cm \u22121 .",

Such a method would allow single-base resolution by measuring the electrical current perpendicular to the DNA backbone. Until now, it is still not clear if the electrical signals obtained for the four nucleotide can be clearly distinguished by a hypothetical experimental setup. Several factors -like the influence of the pentose group or the presence of water -may influence quite strongly the electrical signatures of the four bases. Therefore, in order to obtain a working device, the understanding and detailed description of the conduction mechanisms through DNA bases connected to a metallic electrode is essential. The goal of theoretical studies in this field is to describe the electric signatures of DNA bases from a theoretical point of view. Our study is focused on the detailed description of the electronic structure of DNA's base pairs \"squeezed\" between two Au plates. While such a geometrical model closely mimic the sequencing devices proposed in the literature, it allows us to compute meaningful physical properties such as density of states, charge transfer and orbital localizationby using \"ab initio\" methods. The results allow us to give qualitative prediction over the potential use of such a device in the DNA's sequencing technology.

Aksimentiev 1 1 University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, USA, 2 IBM Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, USA Genomic DNA is densely packed inside cell nuclei and viral capsids. Such close packing suggests that electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged DNA in the condensed states is balanced by counterion-induced attraction. Several theoretical models have been proposed to explain DNA attraction, however, specific microscopic mechanisms are not known. Here, we report all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the effective force between double-stranded DNA in side-by-side and end-to-end orientations. In the side-by-side orientation, the DNA molecules were found to form a bond state in the presence of magnesium ions. In the bond state, the DNA molecules contact each other via their negatively charged phosphate groups, bridged by magnesium ions. The maximum attractive force in the side-by-side orientation is about 40 pN per DNA turn. In the end-to-end orientation, a strong ( > 60 pN) attractive force was observed at short (< 0.8 nm) end-to-end distances regardless of the electrolyte concentration. The presence of a phosphate group at the 5'ends of the fragments was found to direct DNA end-to-end self-assembly and produce bound states resembling a continuous DNA molecule. The computed potentials of the mean force suggest that the end-to-end attraction, rather than being mediated by counterions, is likely caused by hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions between terminal nucleobases of the fragments. Doxorubicin (DOX) is an anticancer antibiotics with a four-membered ring system containing an anthraquinone chromophore, and an aminoglycoside. It has good anticancer activity against a wide spectrum of tumors and is one of the most extensively used antitumor chemotherapeutic compounds currently in clinical use. Interestingly, conversion of DOX to 2pyrrolinodoxorubicin analog (p-DOX) exhibits 500-1000 times higher toxic effects in human breast cancer cell line (Nagy, A. et al., PNAS, 93 (1996 ) 2464 . Molecular mechanisms responsible for this enormously enhanced cytotoxicity have not been entirely clarified. There is good evidence that a key component of the mechanism of action of DOX is its intercalation into DNA and the formation of DOX-DNA adducts. Therefore, we have examined in detail, using the methods of molecular biophysics, DNA interactions of p-DOX in cell-free media and compared these results with the same studies focused on the parental DOX. We find distinct differences between DNA interactions of DOX and p-DOX and suggest that these differences are responsible at least in part for different biological effects of these two anticancer drugs.",

Our strategy is to use Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) to probe selectively the spectral signature of each base in polynucleotides. SERS takes advantage of the strongly increased Raman signals of species when adsorbed on adapted silver colloids. We already demonstrated that adenyl Raman signal of pA in presence of silver colloids is 10 6 times enhanced compared to bulk signal. We plan to use nanoliter droplets of uniformed size that form spontaneously in microchannels when two immiscible fluid streams merge. These tiny droplets are almost ideal reactors as they create homogeneous control condition. We will design an optimized channels network platform that result in droplets production hosting both nucleotides and silver colloids: internal fluids recirculation provide fast and efficient mixing, favoring base adsorption on silver nanoparticles. SERS will be used to determine the chemical composition of the droplets. Nicks represent the most common damage in DNA which occurs naturally in living cells. Structural properties of nicked DNA fragments have been an object of numerous studies due to its special role in reparation processes. Here we report experimental results covering ultrasound irradiation of nicked DNA solutions. Several single-stranded nicks were produced into one strand of dsDNA fragments by the nicking enzyme Bst9I. We have quantitatively estimated the ultrasonic cleavage rates in nicked DNA fragments with known sequences using the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Computer analysis of the cleavage pattern in the 3'-end labeled and primarily intact strand reveal cleavage enhancement in the regions of about 10 b. p. up and down the nicks which were initially produced into complementary strand. The intensity of cleavage near the nicks is (in average) about 20 times higher than cleavage in the same sites of the intact dsDNA fragments. At the same time, the cleavage rates in positions beyond the regions of the nick markedly grow weak even comparing to the sequence-specific cleavage of intact double-stranded DNA fragments. Thus, the presence of the nick serves as an expressive structural indignation, which exceeds modulation of the structure caused by the base-pair sequence and is capable of absorbing mechanical stresses applied to the nearby sites of the molecule.",

We have previously shown that upon irradiation with gamma rays the complex is destabilised mainly because the repressor losses its DNA binding ability. Radiation-induced lesions were identified that may be responsible for this deleterious effect: all tyrosine residues of the headpieces are oxidized into 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA). In order to unravel the mechanisms leading to the observed destabilization of the operator-repressor complex, we compare by MD simulations two complexes: 1-the native complex formed by a dimer of two headpieces and a fragment of DNA with the operator sequence and 2-the damaged complex in which all tyrosines are replaced by DOPA. Analysis of these trajectories shows a loss of stability and binding energy as well as changes in the structure of the damaged complex with respect to the native one. By comparing precisely the evolution of the two complexes we can explain how the oxidation of the tyrosine residues of the headpieces into DOPA may trigger the destabilization of the complex.",

There is a large body of experimental evidence that DNA is the critical target for the cytostatic activity of cisplatin. Platinum complexes form several types of adducts, which occur in DNA with a different frequency and differently distort the conformation of DNA. Clinically ineffective trans isomer of cisplatin (transplatin) also covalently binds to DNA bases. The trans geometry in dichloridoplatinum(II) complexes was activated by various ways. The replacement of at least one amine ligand by planar amine ligand represents example of such activation. Raman spectroscopy is powerful technique for examining both structural and thermodynamic properties of nucleic acids in solution. Interactions of cis-and trans-Pt(II) complexes having nonplanar heterocyclic amine ligand such as piperidine, piperazine and 4-picoline with DNA have been investigated by laser Raman spectroscopy. Raman difference spectra reveal that the Pt(II) complexes induce great structural changes in B-DNA and indicate disordering of B-DNA backbone, reduction in base stacking and base pairing and specific metal interaction with acceptor sites on purine residues.

The hydrogels were designed with hybridized dioligonucleotides grafted to the polymer network as network junctions in addition to the covalent crosslinks or oligonucleotides grafted to the network chains. The probe oligonucleotide destabilizing the junction point by displacement hybridization yielded an optical signal about five times as large as for binding within the hydrogel design with a comblike grafted oligonucleotide. The optical signal was found to be dependent on the concentration of the probe, the sequence and matching length between the probe and sensing oligonucleotide. Concentration sensitivity applied as specific label-free detection of oligonucleotide is estimated to be in the nanomolar region. The current design support detection in excess of 1x10 12 sequences. Amplification of the molecular recognition employing the developed oligonucleotide imprinted hydrogel for label-free sensing of probe oligonucleotide sequences or taking advantage of the oligonucleotide sequence designed as aptamers for determination of other types of molecules are discussed.",

Since immune disbalance is known to be an important manifestation of the disease we were particularly interested in following the labeled immune cells in the familial ALS rat model, hSOD-1 G93A . A T2-or T1-weighted MRI protocol was used with a mini surface coil placed over the skull of the anesthetized animal in a 1.5 T wide bore magnet. In order to compare this approach to standard high field small animal imaging a 7.0 T MRI system was also used. There was a congruence of images of lesions in the brainstem at the two field strengths. It was confirmed with Gd-DTPA contrast that the blood brain barrier (BBB) is compromised at the interbrain level. In order to study immune cell infiltration rats were i.v. injected with magnetically labeled antibodies against helper CD4+ or cytolytic CD8+ killer T cells. By combined T1, T2 and T2* weighted imaging CD4+ lymphocyte infiltration was observed in the brainstem-midbrain region while the CD8+ cells were more confined to the brainstem region. Comparison of MRI of labelled CD4+ vs. CD8+ lymphocytes reveals the relevant cellular inflammatory mechanism in ALS. The appearance of the MRI signal from the latter T cell type points to the mechanism of BBB disruption as suggested from a recent study on the role of CD8+ T cells in a model of multiple sclerosis.",

Emodin inhibits nuclear transcription factor-\u03baB activation and induces free radical production in human mononuclear cells resulting in its antiviral and anti-cancer activity. The uptake and distribution of emodin inside the U-87 MG cell line is studied by combining optical tweezers and surfaceenhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). SERS greatly enhances the spectrum of an otherwise weakly scattering material which is achieved by attaching nano-sized silver colloids to micron-sized dielectric beads. The distribution of emodin in the cell is studied by simultaneously trapping and exciting the SERS bead and scanning it across the membrane while recording the emitted light. Secondly, the beads are statically placed inside the cell and excited at certain intervals in order to track the migration of emodin through the membrane. The results give new insight in to the metabolic pathways of emodin and demonstrate a new imaging and detection technique that is fast and less invasive than current standards.

The main mechanism of biological mode of action of AmB is considered to be associated with formation of ionic membrane pores or channels in the lipid membranes. The aim of this work was to study the influence of the K + and Na + ions on the aggregation process of AmB in aqueous medium. The analysis of electronic absorption and fluorescence spectra of AmB shows that the increasing K + concentration have influence on the level of aggregation of the drug much more than the same amount of Na + ions. This effect is especially noticed at neutral pH values. The RLS technique was used to study aggregation of AmB in solution, in the environment of the K + and Na + ions. The application of this technique makes it possible to study the electronically coupled chromophores, especially molecular aggregates. The results of the ATR-FTIR and Raman spectroscopic studies also support this conclusion. These results provide a better understanding of the interaction between K + and Na + ions and antibiotic which has not been previously considered to be significant for biological action of AmB.",

Characteristic EPR signal of free or weakly bound Mn 2+ was used as an indicator of oxidative status of needles, since coldrelated oxidative damage leads to Mn 2+ release from photosystem II. It was observed that prooxidative conditions developed in the autumn, at the beginning of cold season, which corresponded to significant increase of fructose level. Total SOD, as well as MnSOD activity also rose significantly higher in the autumn.

A different collagen array and crimping pattern in different ligaments may reflect a different mechanical role. Aim of this study was to relate the 3D collagen arrangement and crimping pattern by backward and forward second harmonic imaging microscopy (SHIM) and 2-photon excitation microscopy (2PEM). SHIM on a laser-scanning system is a powerful and unique tool for high-resolution, high-contrast, three-dimensional studies of tissue architecture. Although it is a coherent process the multiple scattering through the tissue give us the capability to acquire signal in both backward and forward direction [1] . SHIM and 2PEM were combined in a dual-mode nonlinear microscopy to find out collagen fibre arrangement and crimping pattern. Both polarization dependence and differences between forward and backward signals allowed to yield information on local structure [2] . Currently used TCSPC FLIM systems are characterised by high counting efficiency, high time resolution, and multiwavelength capability. The systems are, however, restricted to count rates on the order of a few MHz. In the majority of applications, such as FRET or autofluorescence, the photostability of the samples limits the count rate to much lower values. The limitation of the count rate is therefore no problem. However, if FLIM is used for ion concentration measurements or imaging of chlorophyll in plants the available count rates can exceed the counting capability of a single TCSPC channel. We therefore developed a FLIM system that uses eight fully parallel TCSPC channels. By using a polychromator for spectral dispersion and a multichannel PMT for detection we obtain multi-spectral FLIM data at a rate of several frames per second. We will demonstrate the application of the system to dyamic changes of the fluorescence lifetime of chlorophyll in living plants.",

Biological tissues are highly scattering media and this leads to an exponential attenuation of the excitation intensity as the light travels into the sample. While performing imaging of biological scattering tissues in two photon excitation (2PE) regime, the localization of the maximum 2PE intensity was found to shift closer to the surface 1 and the imaging depth limit appears strongly limited by near surface fluorescence 2 . In this work we computed illumination and photobleaching intensity distribution 3 in order to characterize the effects induced by scattering. Simulations of 2PE illumination and photobleaching intensity profiles have been performed for different scattering coefficients and at different focus depth. Furthermore imaging of fluorescent immobile sample (polyelectrolyte gel) allowed to perform an experimental test on thick turbid media.

Molina 2 1 Instituto de Estructura de la Materia (CSIC), Madrid, Spain, 2 Escuela Universitaria de\u00d3ptica, Madrid, Spain Isotopic exchange has long been used for the analysis of biomolecular structure and dynamics. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange rates depend on pH, temperature and biomolecular environment. This is due to hydrogen bonding, low solvent accessibility, and steric blocking. Time resolved measurement of hydrogen-deuterium exchange for subsequent 2D correlation spectroscopic analysis can, then, be very useful to obtain structural information from the said viewpoint. We have developed a microdialysis quartz cell for use in conjunction with Raman spectroscopy to investigate hydrogen-isotope exchange reactions of biomolecules. The system requires only 40 \u00b5l volumes of the initial substrate and perturbing effluent solutions. We have obtained a D 2 O efflux rate of k d = 0.38 \u00b1 0.008 min \u22121 with the greatest MWCO (18 kDa) used here, which involves that an exchange rate of 2.5 min \u22121 is the limiting rate that could be resolved with the said cell system. Analogous results have been obtained using an infrared biospectroscopic microdialysis probe. The use of the method described here has the advantage of avoiding sample dilution (and subsequent signal loss) involved in the known stop flow methods.

Photo-excited FADH \u2022 abstracts an electron from the tryptophan residue W382 in \u223c30 ps (monitored by transient absorption spectroscopy). The subsequent electron transfer steps (from W359 to W382 \u2022+ and from W306 to W359 \u2022+ ) are difficult to resolve experimentally, because electron transfer between chemically identical species does not give rise to net absorption changes. To overcome this difficulty, we make use of the fact that polarized excitation (pulse laser) induces a preferential axis (that of the excited flavin transition) in the system (photoselection), and that W359 and W306 form different angles with that axis (known from the crystal structure). Thus, polarized detection should allow distinguishing between them. Using polarized \"classical\" transient absorption on a nanosecond time scale and the pump-probe technique on a picosecond scale, we demonstrate the feasibility of the method and provide evidence that electron transfer from W306 to W359 \u2022+ is faster than the 30 ps time constant of the initial electron transfer from W382 to excited FADH \u2022 .",

Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconductor nanoparticles with increasing application as fluorescent markers in biology.We investigated structure of the cell walls of different species complexed with CdSe QDs using fluorescence microscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and FTIR techniques. In the experiments we used the cell walls isolated from three distinct plant species: Arabidopsis thaliana, Acer sp. and Picea omorika. We studied both unlabeled and CdSe-labeled cell walls. Fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy were used for detection of QDs alone or complexed to the cell walls. Emission spectra were deconvolved using the Nelder-Mead algorithm in Matlab 6.5. We calculated approximate probability distribution (APD) for positions of spectral component maxima. There was certain difference between unlabeled cell walls and those complexed with QDs. The FTIR spectra also show some difference between the complexed and pure cell walls. The results show that structure was changed, but not significantly in reaction with CdSe QDs. These results are promising in context of use of QDs as labels in cell wall studies. The characterization of the complex of cell wall structure with QDs is a part of the study of nanoparticles application in investigations of plant materials.",

We successfully applied the method to analyze the 3D structure of rough and smooth Russell bodies used as model systems. The major advantages of this approach are the following: (i) the ability to correlate several hundreds of events at the same time, (ii) the possibilit\u02c6to perform 3D correlation, (iii) the potential to immunolabel both endogenous and recombinantly expressed proteins at the same time and (iv) the effective combination of the high data analysis capability of FLM with the high precisionaccuracy of transmission electron microscopy in a CLEM hybrid morphometry analysis. We have identified and optimized critical steps in sample preparation, defined routines for sample analysis and retracing of regions of interest, developed software for semi/fully automatic 3D reconstruction and defined preliminary conditions for an hybrid light/electron microscopy morphometry approach. The relevance of the presented approach lies in two important key elements, namely: the development of optical nanoscopy methods and the potentiality for exploring different correlative frameworks like optical nanoscopy vs. optical microscopy adding scanning force microscopy techniques. Multidrug resistance is a well known phenomenon which limits effectiveness in treating malignancy with chemotherapy by modifying the internalization and/or externalization flow of the drugs through the cancerous cells. Combined chemotherapies, such as MVAC, are therefore currently used in bladder cancer treatment. However, about 30% of patients do not respond this chemotherapy because of inherent or acquired drug resistance. We developed a non invasive predicative test on urinary cells to estimate the chemotherapy effectiveness before treatment, based on the fluorescence emission of MVAC. We first studied the MVAC photophysical properties in solution and using five cell lines: a drug sensitive cancer cell line MGH-u1S, its multidrug resistant subline MGH-u1R, a not tumorigenic cell line SV-HUC-1, its tumorigenic counterpart MC-SV-HUC T-2 and a cell line from transitional cell carcinoma T24. The results revealed a penetration and localization of the drug depending of the cell line type, allowing us to find a specific fluorescence signature for the identification of MVAC resistant cells. Similar data have been obtained for cytospined fixed culture cells and patients urinary cells.",

The translation of useful laboratory-derived knowledge into clinical practice has been hampered by the difficulty of detecting, characterizing and monitoring molecules and cells in the human body, especially dynamically. Advanced bi ophotonic imaging is best suited for studying such entities, but has been lagging in clinical acceptance, in spite of major advances, and a clear need for the kind of resolution (spatial, temporal, spectral) and specificity that it alone can offer. Biophysics-based new strategies are needed to address this challenge. The development of biophysical methods for translational medicine will be reviewed, with emphasis on our recent advances.

With imaging fulfilling its dual role of better describing anatomy and physiology, intrasurgical histopathologyequivalent molecular and cellular imaging is achievable in vivo, as is a closer spatio-temporal connection between imaging and intervention.

Mateo 1 1 IBMC, Universidad Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez, Elche, Spain, 2 CQFM, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Lisbon, Portugal Immobilization of liposomes shows interesting applications in protein biology, membrane biophysics and biosensor technology. Previous fluorescence spectroscopy works revealed that the entrappement of zwitterionic phospholipid liposomes in a silica sol-gel matrix alters the thermodynamic properties as well as the fluidity of the lipid bilayer. Interactions between the polar head of phospholipids and the porous surface of the host matrix could be responsible of such behaviour. In order to get more insight into this possibility we have immobilized, for the first time, giant unilamelar vesicles (GUVs) and the shape and size of these structures as well as the possible existence of lipid domains have been visualized through fluorescence confocal microscopy. This technique allows for direct observation of the effect of encapsulation on an individual liposome, in contrast to the averaged information given by macroscopic spectroscopic techniques. Liposomes composed of pure POPC or DOPC as well as mixtures DOPC/DPPC were labelled with the fluorescent probes Bodipy, Rhd-PE and Rhd-DOPE. Preliminary results shows that only the smallest GUVs (6-10\u00b5m) survive to the encapsulation process but often with a slight loss of its sphericity, probably due to pressures suffered during the matrix gelation. However no change in the gel/fluid phase proportion has been observed for immobilized DOPC/DPPC GUVs, regarding to solution. Solvent fluctuations play a key role in controlling protein motions and functions. Here, we have studied how the reaction catalyzed by the light-activated enzyme protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR) couple with solvent dynamics (G. Durin et al, Biophysical J. (2009 ) 96, 1902 . To simultaneously monitor the catalytic cycle of the enzyme and the solvent dynamics, we designed temperature-dependent UV-visible microspectrophotometry experiments, using flash-cooled nano-droplets of POR. The temperature-dependant formation of the first two intermediates in the POR reaction were measured, together with the solvent glass transition temperature (T g ) and the build-up of crystalline ice. We find that formation of the first intermediate occurs below T g and is not affected by solvent dynamics, whereas formation of the second intermediate occurs above T g and is influenced by solvent dynamics. These results suggest that internal protein motions drive the first step of the POR reaction whereas solvent slaved motions control the second step. We propose that the concept of solvent slaving applies to complex enzymes such as POR. Amphotericin B (AmB) is one of the main polyene antibiotics widely used to treat deep-seated fungal infections. The mechanism of biological action of AmB is most probably directly related to the ability of the drug to form hydrophilic pores in the membrane core, thus affecting physiological transport of ions. The effects of AmB-Cu 2+ complexation are demonstrated by the electronic absorption and fluorescence spectra. The absorption spectra of AmB in water (pH=7) after the injection of water solution of copper(II)sulfate display a complex structure with hypsochromic-and bathochromic-shifted bands indicative of formation of molecular aggregates of the drug. Formation of the electronically coupled chromophores of AmB, especially aggregates, was analyzed at different Cu 2+ concentrations by the RLS (Resonance Light Scattering) technique. Intensity of the fluorescence emission spectrum (characteristic of the dimeric form of AmB) decreases after the AmB-Cu 2+ complex formation. This effect of the formation of the AmB aggregated structures by AmB-Cu 2+ are different from the spontaneous molecular aggregation process, as deduced from the spectroscopic analysis.",

The number of sensilla on the left and right antennae was recorded by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Each antenna segment, from 14 insects, was observed from 4 different viewpoints in order to image the whole antenna surface and compute the number of sensilla. The tested compounds induced higher EAG responses on the right than on the left antenna at every dose.

We have explored if a similar approach might be useful to study DNA topology using intercalating cyanine dyes such as YOYO-1. There are two main advantages of this approach: i) DNA labelling with intercalating dyes is straightforward, and ii) the free dye in solution is essentially non-fluorescent, greatly reducing the fluorescence background. We show that YOYO-1 can blink in the absence of oxygen and in the presence of cysteamine, which allows its application to nanoscale imaging. We exemplify its use by imaging \u03bb-DNA and a pUC19 plasmid. We also explore the compatibility of several intercalating dyes with biological systems such as enzymes or cells.

Stemmer Nanotechnology Group, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy is an effective widefield imaging tool that selectively excites a very thin sample layer within the evanescent excitation field at the glass-water interface. Lateral resolution of standard TIRF microscopy is limited to approx. 240nm using green emission, which can be insufficient for a large class of biological investigations. Additionally, the evanescent excitation field is prone to light scattering, creating out of focus blur in the final image. We present several techniques that address these mentioned shortcomings of standard TIRF microscopy. Using evanescent standing waves, the lateral resolution in TIRF microscopy can be extended by a factor of 2.5, reaching 90nm. We further show techniques to reduce the blur induced by light scattering of the evanescent field. Finally, we demonstrate optical sub-sectioning capabilities in TIRF microscopy by acquiring several images with different penetration depth of the evanescent field and applying suitable post processing algorithms. Thereby the obtainable z-resolution exceeds the classical limit of widefield microscopy, and object structures lying within the evanescent field can be reconstructed. The natural photosentizer hypericine (Hyp) exhibits potent properties for tumor diagnosis and photodynamic therapy. Evidences of Hyp release from LDLs prior to passive diffusion within cells are addressed in this study. Fluorescent properties of Hyp have been used for dynamic studies of its interaction with low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) and U87 glioma cells. Subsequent non-specific staining of intracellular membranes compartment were observed by mean of colocalization fluorescent imaging studies. It was shown, that monomers of Hyp are only redistributive forms. Increasing of Hyp concentration leads to the formation of non-fluorescent aggregates within LDLs as well as within the U87 cells, and can preclude its photosensitizing activities. In all experiments, hydrophobic character of the molecules appears as the driving force of its redistribution process. Acknowledgment: This work was supported by the Slovak Res. and Dev.

Little is still known about the molecular complex of these two proteins in the living cell. In this work we first studied the cellular chromatin interaction of eGFP-tagged LEDGF/p75 with tunable-focus fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (TF-FCS) and show that LEDGF/p75 is in equilibrium between a free Brownian motion and a very slow movement on the chromatin. Being dependent on the size of the laser focus, this slow movement represents a continuous associationdissociation-reassociation process that is governed by diffusion. Concentration-dependent continuous photobleaching measurements (CP) furthermore revealed the existence of high-affinity chromatin binding sites. Next, we co-expressed mRFP-tagged IN and confirmed its intracellular interaction with LEDGF/p75 by fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS). Interestingly, CP and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) indicated that the affinity of this complex for chromatin is exceptionally high. By twophoton fluorescence lifetime imaging (2P-FLIM) we verified if the cellular stoichiometry was altered when the proteins were expressed together. We believe that this work is useful for the understanding and targeting of HIV-replication.",

The second harmonic generation (SHG) and 2-photon excitation (2PE) microscopy were used to set out the muscle structure and its relationship with nerve terminal. Sections were observed at a multimodal nonlinear microscope composed by the Leica CLSM.

GABA and GABAbR1 IR neuromuscular junctions (NJ) were localized in the limb muscle fibers; VGAT IR cells surrounded each limb muscles. These results suggest that GABA plays a key role in the regulation of limbs movement. The SHG was very useful to outline the relationship between nerve terminals and limbs muscle fibers. Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) are very useful model membrane systems to study many aspects of lipid-lipid and lipid protein interactions, particularly employing fluorescence microscopy related techniques (Bagatolli 2006) . The use of this model system can be particularly useful to study aspects related with the lateral structure of bacterial membranes using the aforementioned approach (i.e. fluorescence microscopy). Bacterial cells have a size close to the resolution limit of optical microscopy and details about the organization of their membranes are not easy to achieve using such technique. Recently a new electroformation method to prepare GUVs composed of compositionally complex mixtures under physiological conditions was developed in our laboratory (Montes 2007). In the present work we further extended this electroformation method to prepare GUVs composed of bacterial lipid extracts and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In our experiments we used E.coli lipid extract to prepare small vesicles containing various LPS species, from smooth strains and rough mutants. SUVs were used as starting point to electroform GUVs using various types of buffers with high ionic strength. The successfully obtained bacterial-GUVs were used to study the interaction of these membranes with known LPS-binging proteins (lung surfactant protein D, SP-D) and peptides (polymyxin B).

These results permit to trace the structural organization of the long N-terminal domain of CP29.

The novel soft X-ray spectromicroscopy approach of the TwinMic instrument at the Elettra synchrotron radiation facility is combining several imaging modes for morphology characterization, such as scanning, projection and full-field imaging with several contrast techniques including brightfield, darkfield, differential phase and interference contrast at sub-100 nm lateral resolution. Complementary chemical information is provided by chemical imaging and micro-spectroscopy using the photon-in/photon-out Xray absorption and X-ray fluorescence. Unique for TwinMic is the low-energy X-ray fluorescence setup operated at 280 -2200 eV photon energies, which allows simultaneous analysis of the morphology, and the distribution of light elements on cellular and sub-cellular level. In the presentation the principles of the methods used in the TwinMic instruments the performance and potentials of the instrument will be demonstrated by several examples of applications in the field of human, animal and plant biology, biophysics and chemistry, physiology and genetics.

For this kind of studies, protein reconstitution in membranes systems via a detergent-mediated pathway is usually successfully adopted, since detergents are generally used in the initial isolation and purification of membrane proteins. In this study we report the reconstitution of OmpF in preformed DMPC and E. coli liposomes using two different techniques for detergent removal: (1) exclusion chromatography and (2) incubation with detergent adsorbing beads. The incorporation degree was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay and fluorescence anisotropy was used to determine OmpF effect on the structural order of membrane lipids. These results show that protein insertion in membranes depends both on the technique used to remove detergent and on the lipids used to prepare the liposomes. Moreover more anisotropy and atomic force microscopy studies will allow a better characterization of bacterial model system membranes.",

Therefore, our aim is to characterize the luminescent properties of such nanoparticles regarding their excitation and emission. In this study, the excitation and emission spectra of AuNP with different sizes below 50 nm in an excitation range of 720 nm to 900 nm were investigated. Our study shows the emission spectra curves of AuNP are broadband spectrum and vary with the changing of excitation wavelength from 720 nm to 900 nm. The results also suggest the minimum laser power necessary to trap the AuNP depends on particle size and excitation light wavelength and a maximum power above which the particles are destroyed.

Optical studies have revealed that after binding, virus particles move laterally on the membrane, but the complexity of the cellular environment and the drawbacks of fluorescence microscopy have prevented access to the molecular dynamics of early virus-host couplings. Here, we examine a model system, in which single Simian viruses (SV40) interact with their GM1 ganglioside receptors in supported lipid bilayers. We employed scattering interferometry and single molecule fluorescence localization to visualize the vectorial rotational motion of virions. At low receptor concentration, we observed sliding and tumbling of single virions during rapid lateral diffusion. In contrast, at increased receptor concentration the virions repeatedly underwent periods of standstill, reminiscent of their behavior prior to endocytosis. By an unprecedented combination of millisecond time and nanometer spatial resolutions, we revealed that during these immobile periods, the virions rock back and forth among nanoscopic spots separated by 9 nm. Our insights, together with the structure of the viral capsid, suggest aggregation of receptors in nanodomains and recurrent swap of binding between receptor molecules and neighboring viral protein pentamers. Herein, we have developed different membrane probes binding spontaneously to the outer plasma membrane leaflet and showing sensitivity to membrane properties such as surface charge and phase state. The first two types of probes were based on 3-hydroxyflavone fluorophore. One of them showed a high sensitivity to the surface charge and to the phase state of lipid bilayers, while the other was only sensitive to the surface charge. The third type, which was based on Nile Red fluorophore, was sensitive only to the phase state. Surprisingly, the probes that were sensitive only to the surface charge did not respond to apoptosis, while the other two types of probes showed significant spectroscopic response to it. Moreover, the latter exhibited response to cholesterol depletion, which was similar to that observed on apoptosis. Thus, according to our data, the intact living cells present a remarkable fraction of the cholesterol-rich domains, while apoptotic loss of the transmembrane asymmetry decreases it dramatically. These probes represent a new tool for quantification of surface charge and cholesterol-rich domains in cell membranes.",

Lenaz 2 1 Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Padova, Padova, Italy, 2 Universit\u00e0 degli studi di Bologna, Bologna, Italy Complex I (NADH Dehydrogenase) plays a central role in cellular energy production, transferring two electrons from NADH through a series of iron-sulfur clusters (FeS) to ubiquinone (coenzyme Q); the electron transfer is coupled to the translocation of protons across the membrane. The FeS center N2 is the last acceptor in the electron-transfer chain, but the mechanism through which the enzyme couples the 1e \u2212 reduction of the FeS centers to the 2e \u2212 reduction of ubiquinone (Q\u2192SQ\u2192QH 2 ) is unclear [1] . In our experiments, submitochondrial particles were treated with different inhibitors, in the absence or in the presence of different quinone analogues, and NADH addition initiated the electron transfer. We assess by EPR (Electron Paramagnetic Resonance) spectroscopy the relative abundance of the reduced N2 center and of the semiquinone radical, and coupled EPR data to enzymatic activity assays and to fluorescence measurements on the effect of inhibitors on Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production. We identify two different classes of inhibitors showing different effects on ROS production. Moreover the redox state of the complex has shown to depend both on the inhibitors and on the quinone analogues. A possible mechanism of the electron transfer, that can explain the experimental findings, will be presented. Conventional fluorescence microscopy suffers from a resolution limit imposed by the diffraction of light. Stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy overcomes this resolution barrier without being limited by the wavelength by taking advantage of the photophysics of the observed sample into the image formation process, and has proven to be a powerful approach for exploring relevant biological issues. The outstanding resolution of STED microscopy is achieved by drastically minimizing the spatial extent of the focal region from which fluorescent molecules can emit signal in the sample. So far, mainly complex and relatively expensive lasers systems providing pulsed beams have been used to inhibit the fluorescence in the outer area of the focal region. Here we report on the development of a new setup based on a fast beam scanning confocal microscope using compact turn-key and inexpensive continuous wave lasers. The great potential of this simple configuration is demonstrated for a selection of commonly used fluorescent markers.",

Recombinant HBsAg produced in yeast can self-assemble into 22-nm immunogenic spherical particles that are used in licensed Hepatitis B vaccines (protein/lipid ratio is 60/40 in mass). HBsAg size and shape have been mainly investigated by transmission electron microscopy after negative staining of the particles.

Here we describe new structural insights of HBsAg particles using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) performed under physiological conditions. We applied atomic force microscopy to define structural details of the surface organization with a resolution in the nanometer range. As expected, the diameter of HBsAg particles is 26,8 \u00b1 2,5 nm in average. The surface of these particles clearly shows the presence of protuberances that most probably correspond to proteins. Indeed, reduction and alkylation induces the disappearance of the protuberances. The number of the protuberances estimated from AFM micrographs is about 70 per spherical particles.",

Confocal microscopy images have highlighted possible colocalisation of EHV-1 with membrane 'rafts'. Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent microscopy was then used to identify viral binding at the membrane with high contrast images, able to observe single virus particles. Establishing the viral entry pathway into PBMCs would allow drugs that target this process to be employed, reducing clinical viraemia. The interpretation of in-vivo binding rate measurements allows inferring the molecular interactions that regulate cellular functions. Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) is a widely used tool to quantify binding reactions in vivo. However the lack of \"golden standards\" for these measurements requires the measured binding rates to be validated with other techniques. We present a new Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) method to measure the in vivo bound fractions and residence times for molecules that interact with an immobile substrate. We apply this method to measure binding of mutants of the transcription factor VBP (vitellogenin binding protein) to the DNA. Comparison of FCS with FRAP results in comparable estimates of the measured diffusion constants and bound fractions. However, FCS provides an estimate of the VBP residence time at the DNA, while FRAP does not. This limitation in the analysis of VBP is due to the larger photobleaching volume used in FRAP, if compared to the observation volume of an FCS experiment. In sum, we present a method to measure binding rates with FCS. Substantial agreement of this method with FRAP is shown. However, further validation on tightly bound molecules will be necessary to assess if FRAP and FCS agree in the measurement of residence times.",

For example, actin structures associated with formins can bind tropomyosin and profilin, while those polymerised by the nucleation of the Arp2/3 complex bind cofilin and myosin I. The molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of the formation of these protein complexes is still ambiguous. We have shown recently that formins can bind the actin filaments and change their conformational state. Subsequent binding of other actin-binding proteins, such as tropomyosin and myosin, can reverse these changes. It appears that the reversal effect assumes that the actin-binding protein binds the filaments in a well-defined and specific binding site. The altered conformational state of the actin filaments observed after the binding of these proteins provides a possible explanation for the modified affinity of the filaments for other-actin binding proteins. Based on the results available so far we assume that the affinities are modified differently by different nucleation factors, and the conformational changes introduced to actin by actin nucleation factors can serve as the molecular bases for the regulation of the formation of actin based intracellular protein complexes. Experiments are currently in progress to test and further corroborate the existence of such regulatory mechanisms in living cells. Correlation between sub-cellular distribution of photoactive drug Hypericin (Hyp), determined by applied delivery systems (Hyp vs Hyp/LDL), and mode of the cell death is addressed in this study. Co-localization of Hyp with mitochondria, lysosomes and Golgi apparatus in U-87 MG glioma cells was determined by confocal laser scanning microscopy in using organelle specific fluorescent dyes as well as by time resolved FRET experiments. Flow cytometry experiments were realized to study a photodynamic effect of Hyp (598 nm/4 Jcm \u22121 ) on cells. Significant differences in the proportional representation of live, apoptotic and/or necrotic cells were observed for different types of delivery systems of Hyp 24 hours after Hyp (5x10 \u22127 M) photoactivation. Conclusions: i) Sub-cellular distribution of Hyp depends on using delivery systems, ii) the mode of cell death depends more on concentration of Hyp inside cells, than on different type of delivery systems (for non selective wide-field cell illumination), iii) fluorescence lifetime is sensitive parameter to study sub-cellular distribution of Hyp. Novel time-resolved spectroscopic methods have been used to investigate the interactions between a fluorescently-labelled mutant of the peptide melittin and supported lipid bilayers, formed by self-assembly at a silica-water interface via vesicle deposition. Time-resolved evanescent wave-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (TREWIFS) is a surface-selective technique in which the evanescent field from a pulsed laser source is used to photoexcite fluorescent species at an interface. The resulting fluorescence decay kinetics, measured using time-correlated single-photon counting, report on the micro-domains experienced by those fluorescent species at an interface. Extending TREWIFS to time-resolved evanescent wave-induced fluorescence anisotropy measurements (EW-TRAMS) provides dynamic rotational information of a fluorescent species, reporting on its mobility at an interface. Presented here are TREWIFS and EW-TRAMS data obtained from the fluorescence of an Alexa 430-labelled melittin mutant interacting with a dipalmitoylphosphocholine bilayer at room temperature, physiological pH and ionic strength. The results provide new insights into the conformation, location and motion of cytolytic peptides interacting with cell membranes. Optical tweezers are used to controllably apply forces to red blood cells and the resulting chemical and structural changes are monitored using Raman spectroscopy. The forces are applied in vivo and mimic that which the cell undergoes mechanically as it passes through vessels and smaller capillaries. The first result presented will be spectroscopic evidence of a transition between the oxygenation and deoxygenation states of hemoglobin that is caused by the stretching of the red blood cell. The transition is due to mechanically induced enhancements of hemoglobin-membrane and hemoglobin neighbor-neighbor interactions. The latter, lesser known effect is further studied by modeling the electrostatic binding of two of the protein structures using molecular dynamics methods. Secondly, polarized Raman spectroscopy is utilized to study the packing and ordering of the hemoglobin proteins in the red blood cell as it is stretched. Depolarization ratios for a number of heme group modes change, indicating that the applied force additionally packs and orders the proteins inside the cell which further demonstrates the role of cell deformation in the oxygen transport kinetics.

Even though this FRET pair appears to be ideal for monitoring protein-protein interactions, the most commonly used fixed laser wavelengths do not excite Cerulean at peak absorption.

But under spatial conditions they may be replaced by much heavier ions, for example Cs + . To determine the influence of heavy counterions on internal dynamics of the double helix the conformational vibrations of Na-and Cs-DNA are studied. For this purpose the model of conformational vibrations of DNA with counterions is used [Perepelytsya S.M., Volkov S.N., Eur.Phys.J. E. 24, 261, 2007] . As the result the frequencies and amplitudes of vibrations for B -DNA with Na + and Cs + counerions are calculated.

The calculated amplitudes of vibrations show that light counterions not disturb the DNA internal dynamics, but heavy counterions make move all structure elements of the double helix. Using the valence-optic approach the intensities of the DNA vibrations in Raman spectra are calculated.

There are several advantages jn the use of SC sources: spatially coherent white radiation, tuning ranges of approximately 400 nm, high brightness, a robust compact system (potentially all-fibre) and relatively low cost.

Here we have studied Capsular antigen fraction 1 (or Caf1), secreted through the conserved chaperone/usher pathway by the plague agent Yersinia pestis [1] . Caf1 is highly immunogenic and is used in a recombinant subunit vaccine against plague. Recent immunological studies indicated vaccines containing polymeric Caf1 have higher protective efficacy than vaccines containing its monomeric variant. This difference in protective efficacy was attributed to the quaternary structure. However the quaternary structure of Caf1 has not been characterized [2] . In our study we have used transmission electron microscopy of negatively stained specimen and linear dichroism spectroscopy to determine the quaternary structure of recombinant Caf1. Whereas electron microscopy revealed morphology of Caf1 fibres bound to the surface of a carbon coated grid, linear dichroism gave the orientation of subunits in flow aligned Caf1 fibres in solution. Our results show recombinant Caf1 comprises extended linear fibres and circularized fibres, both of which have high degree of conformational freedom. Despite the vast application of Lambert-Beer law in biology, this empirical law cannot accurately describe the light absorption process of molecules with a long-lived excited state. This family of molecules includes most fluorescent molecules, which are very important in biology. Lambert-Beer law is in fact only valid at very low intensity of incident light and very low concentration of chromophore. If the system doesn't meet these conditions, it falls into a nonlinear regime when it is affected by a phenomenon which we call \"dynamic photobleaching\": the depletion of chromophores from the first layers, due to their transition to the excited state, leads to a sub-exponential propagation of light in the medium [1] . This phenomenon leads to the necessity of a new formula for the light absorption dynamics which depends on the lifetime of the excited state of the chromophore. The predictions of the theory were successful in describing the absorption dynamics of azobenzene [2] , but now they have been tested also on a biologically relevant molecule like chlorophyll. The results indicate that the absorbance is affected by the intensity of the incident light, and it is therefore a non reliable way of determining, for example, the concentration of the molecule. ",

In particular, shot-noise substantially influences the spatial high-frequency range inducing a remarkable reduction of the optical transfer bandwidth. The insertion of an annular filter on the microscope objective lens in the illumination light pathway is here proposed to retrieve the high frequencies information loss [2] .The electromagnetic interference effect induced by the filter insertion, gives a redistribution of the optical transfer function. In particular, the microscope frequency response in filter scheme exhibits an enhancement of signal to noise ratio at the high frequencies able to recover the high frequencies hampered by shot-noise [3] . The goal of biomarker studies is to develop simple noninvasive tests that identify disease states. Focus is beginning to shift from identification of individual biomarkers to identification of biomarker panels comprising multiple targets of different molecular species. There are, however, no current technologies available that allow for a comprehensive and simultaneous analysis of the expression levels of multiple cellular components, i.e. proteins and RNA. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) polaritons are surface electromagnetic waves that propagate in a direction parallel to the interface between a metal surface and an external medium e.g., liquid. These oscillations are very sensitive to any change of this boundary, a phenomenon that has been exploited to facilitate label-free, real-time detection of biological interactions, e.g. protein binding interactions. We are utilising the power of SPR to develop technologies that facilitate diagnostic procedures for complex diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, through identification and detection of patterns of biomolecules indicative of disease. Our approach will facilitate better disease characterisation, improve early detection strategies and aid drug discovery.",

Seeger Institute of Physical Chemistry, University of Z\u00fcrich, Winterthurerstrasse 190, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland A two channel confocal microscope for surface and simultaneously in solution fluorescence detection is presented. The microscope's core element is a parabolic mirror objective that collects the fluorescence above the critical angles for total internal reflection (TIRF) of the water/glass interface. An aspheric lens incorporated into the parabolic mirror is used for diffraction limited focusing and collecting the fluorescence at low angles with respect to the optical axis. This low angles excitation approach is technically straightforward and gives an advantage over high numerical objectives that require very high angles for TIRF illumination. By separating the collection of the fluorescence into supercritical and subcritical angles, two detection volumes highly differing in their axial resolution are generated at the interface. The surface selectivity of the detection volume is obtained on the basis of the dipole emission profile near a dielectric interface. Its angular distribution is highly anisotropic and consists of a superposition of traveling and evanescent waves, which both are detected using the parabolic mirror objective. Unlike with objective TIRF microscopy, the parabolic mirror objective achieves easily diffraction limited excitation/detection volume at the water/glass interface. The objective optical performance is shown by measuring the actin cytoskeleton of cultured cells, FRET energy transfer within adsorbed clustered proteins and single molecules detection.",

It is still controversial by which molecular mechanism the signaling complex is fully activated: dimerization of chains, large conformational change upon IL-4 binding or a combination of both. Moreover, the influence of the lipid environment in which the activation takes place is poorly characterized. To address these issues we aim to reconstitute the receptor component in artificial membrane systems to study the various mutual interactions by means of fluorescence-based techniques, mainly fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.

Through the introduction of a sufficiently small confocal pinhole, the lateral resolution can be enhanced compared to that of a wide field microscope. However, this gain in resolution comes at the cost of a decrease in detection efficiency, as light blocked by the pinhole is lost. We present a method for improving the lateral resolution (extending work of Sandeau et al. [1] ) and detection efficiency of scanning microscopes by adding an interferometer with image inversion in one of its arms to the detection pathway [2] . This surpasses the lateral resolution achievable in a conventional confocal microscope (closed pinhole) while increasing the detection efficiency substantially. Point spread function measurements for a UZ-Interferometer (UZI) are shown. The light in this setup follows threedimensional U-and Z-shaped paths and relies on reflections off planar surfaces only in order to achieve image inversion. We achieved an interference contrast of 91% for white light, and excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. ",

Hell Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Department of NanoBiophotonics, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany Fluorescence far-field microscopy is a indispensable tool in modern life science. However, the resolution of its standard variants is limited by diffraction to \u223c200nm in the focal plane and \u223c600nm along the optical axis. To overcome this limit, a new class of super-resolution microscopy techniques has been designed. One example is 4Pi microscopy. To obtain isotropic resolution, 4Pi uses interference of the wave fronts from two opposing lenses. The point spread function (PSF) of 4Pi system is characterized by multiple maxima/sidelobes, which replicate the object in the image. Therefore image restoration is mandatory to render unambiguous imaging. The situation is further complicated because the positions and the relative heights of the multiple maxima/sidelobes of the PSF depend on the phase difference (PD) between the two wave fronts at the focus. If the refractive index of the sample varies in space, this PD becomes a function of position and 4Pi image formation process looses its shift invariance. The PD function (PDF) may not even be known a-priori and must then be estimated from the image, leading to a blind image restoration problem. Here, we propose a maximum a-posteriori based method to solve the problem. We either assumed a mathematical model for the PDF that depends on a small number of parameters or allowed for an arbitrary PDF but introduced a smoothing constraint. Designer multicomponent lipoplexes have recently emerged as especially promising transfection candidates, since they are from 10 to 100 times more efficient than binary complexes usually employed for gene delivery purposes [1] [2] [3] . Here, we show, for the first time, that after internalization binary complexes of lower transfection potency remain in compact perinuclear endosomes, while multicomponent systems have intrinsic endosomal rupture properties that allow plasmid DNA to escape from endosomes with extremely high efficiency [4] . Endosomal rupture results in an extraordinarily homogeneous distribution of unbound plasmid DNA throughout the cytoplasm and in the nucleus [4] . Fluorescence spectroscopy and stopped-flow technique were utilized for the study of the kinetics of incorporation of hypericin (Hyp), a natural photosensitizing pigment, into lowdensity lipoproteins (LDL). Triphasic kinetics of Hyp association with LDL was observed when solutions of Hyp and LDL were mixed together. The most rapid phase of Hyp incorporation is completed within tens of msec, while the slowest one lasts 10-20 min. The most of Hyp molecules are incorporated into LDL in the slowest phase. The kinetics of the incorporation of Hyp into LDL particles pre-loaded with Hyp were also investigated. The observed decrease of the lifetime and total intensity of Hyp fluorescence with the increase of the incubation time of Hyp with Hyp/LDL complex is a sign of the formation of aggregates and the dynamic quenching of singlet excitation state of Hyp inside LDL. To study the kinetics of a transfer of Hyp molecules between LDL particles, the time evolution of the stopped-flow and time-resolved fluorescence experiments were investigated after the mixing of the complex Hyp/LDL=200:1 with appropriate amounts of free LDL. For each final Hyp/LDL ratio the increase of the lifetime and total intensity of Hyp fluorescence was observed. The half-time of this process is similar to that one of the slowest phase of Hyp incorporation into free LDL.",

We also subjected our substrates to a chemical treatment capable of rendering its surface stable and hydrophilic and we verified that it makes them suitable for neuron culturing.",

            "text": "Most of the therapeutic proteins are clinically administered through an intravenous injection several times a day / week. Because the repeated injections are not convenient and cause pain in patients, an alternative route of administration is desirable such as oral or nasal. Unfortunately, proteins are easily degraded by proteolytic enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract and, therefore, have a low bioavailability when administered via oral route. Physica Pharma has gained experience in forming sprayable solutions combining lipoamino acids (LAA) and Small Therapeutic Organic Compounds with the aim to improve their intranasal absorption. In the present work we investigated the ability of LAA to complex large molecule such as Human Erythropoietin, Human growth hormone and salmon calcitonin in order to form easily sprayable colloids. These three proteins are used respectively to treat anaemia, growth problem and hypercalcemy. Circular dichroism and dynamic light scattering were used to further characterize the LAA-Protein colloids. A specific molar ratio of LAA versus protein was found for wich the proteins keep their secondary structure and have an overall isotropic size slightly increased. Molecular dynamics show that proteins are indeed coated with LAA. Such a complex is shown to pass very easily through a culture of nasal cells growth at confluence. In this study we describe two systems based on soft matter designed for the drug delivery and for the replacement of synovial fluid in osteoarticular pathologies. (i) a new class of temperature sensitive hydrogels PVA/Poly(MA m NiPAAm n ) shaped as microspheres obtained with a water-in-water emulsion photocrosslinking reaction. Microparticles of PVA/Poly(MA m NiPAAm n ) with m:n theoretical molar ratios equal to 1:0; 1:4, 1:8 have been studied in terms of average size and responsiveness to temperature characterized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and differential scanning microcalorimetry (DSC). (ii) a physical network based on hyaluronic acid with a small extent (degree of substitution: 1%) of hydrophobic moiety grafted on the backbone, HYADD4, has been characterized in order to account for the influence of thermal treatment on the stability of the hydrogel. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and small angle neutron scattering (SANS) have been used for dynamic-structural characterization of HYADD4 hydrogels. Diffusion of macromolecular probes has been studied by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to study the mesoscopic texture of the hydrogel and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were used to approach the time evolution of the physical junction points and of chains clusters.",

An attractive goal is to design gels in such a way that the active molecules are delivered by the material according to specific release sequences. The transport of macromolecules within polymeric gels depends: on the obstruction effects of the surrounding gel strands, on the molecular interactions between the gel and the solute, on the interactions between the solute molecules themselves and the interactions between the solute and the solvent. Physical polysaccharide gels were evaluated in this work to probe diffusion over both microscopic and macroscopic distance scales. Physical gels from agar and starch were investigated by high and low resolution NMR techniques in order to characterize their structures. Obstruction effects of the surrounding gel strands were considered by studying diffusion of glucose. Local diffusion, due to Brownian motion, was quantified by low resolution NMR spectroscopy. The Fickian diffusion coefficient was measured by modelling experimental concentration-distance curves obtained by means of a two-compartment diffusion-cell. Diffusion coefficients depend on the viscoelastic properties of the gel matrix and on water-polysaccharide interactions.",

Donath Medizinische Institut f\u00fcr Physik und Biophysik, Leipzig, Germany Rather than being just pathogens, from the view point of biotechnology and materials science viruses can be regarded as nanocontainers in which nucleic acids have been enclosed in a protective self assembled protein cage. In some viruses an additional lipid-protein envelope wraps the capsid shell. The capsid is constituted of several copies of one single protein subunit or just a few, arranged in a regular fashion showing icosahedral symmetry. The mechanical properties of the cage are important for understanding the infection mechanism involving the release of the encaged genome. By means of Atomic Force Microscopy, it becomes possible to probe such material properties by nanoindentations of single viral particles. It is very interesting to learn how strong or brittle a virus can be. Here we have studied the mechanical properties of empty Rubella virus particles (RLPs) due response of external applied forces. We found that RLPs are extremely soft comparable to that of some rubber materials. A peculiarity of the rubella virus is that the capsid is considerably smaller than the surrounding shell filling only a fraction of the lumen provided by the envelope. The envelope in Rubella has a distinguishable response on the material properties of the virus. Deformation and fracture of the capsid requires comparatively larger forces. Our results indicate that the pH is a major factor influencing on rubella particle material properties. This can be related to the infection mechanism. Pentavalent antimony (PA) (Glucantime, Sanofi-Aventis or Glaxo) are the mainstream agents of choice for Leishmaniasis treatment. In therapeutic doses the PA treatment has cardiac side effects like electrocardiographic (ECG) alterations, that include QT segment prolongation, T wave flattening or inversion, inversion of ST segment, P, R and T waves amplitude reductions, torsade de pointes arrhythmias and sudden death by cardiac arrest. The objective of this study was to characterize the arrhythmogenic potential of PA. We used 30 guinea-pig to assess the chronic effects of PA therapeutic dose on corrected QT interval, QT dispersion, ventricular action potential (AP) amplitude and duration at 30% and 90% of maximal repolarization and survival rate. Guinea-pig received daily 30mg/kg PA or saline for 15 days. Eight lead ECG were recorded before and in the last treatment day. At the end the animals were killed and the left ventricle papillary muscles excised for AP recording with the intracellular microelectrode technique. Our results of chronic PA treatment showed significant increase of QRS complex duration, QT interval duration, QT dispersion and incidence of T wave flattening or inversion and arrhythmias. The AP analysis demonstrated prolongation at 90% duration. The treatment was lethal in 30% of the animals. We concluded that PA is a proarrhythmic drug that upon chronic use may causes arrhythmias and mortality by disturbances in the ventricular repolarization process.",

We hypothesize that co-injection of stem cells encapsulated within an optimized physical hydrogel will enhance viability. Whereas, current physical hydrogels require a shift in environmental conditions (e.g., pH, temperature) to initiate the sol-gel phase transition during encapsulation, our newly designed molecular-recognition gels do not require environmental triggers. Instead, these \"physical epoxy-like\" gels consist of two components that undergo a sol-gel transition upon mixing due to specific hydrogen bonding. The gel viscoelasticity is predictably tuned through precise variation in the molecular-level design of the two components, created using recombinant protein techniques. The design of the two components is based on simple polymer physics considerations and utilizes bio-mimimcry. Adult neural stem cells or mesenchymal stem cells are encapsulated within these gels with high viability at constant physiological conditions. The gels promote the growth and differentiation of neural progenitors into neuronal phenotypes, which adopt a 3D-branched morphology. The gels are further optimized for use in the central nervous system by tethering neuroprotective peptides to the gel through molecular-recognition sites. These peptides are released-on-demand by cells through the action of proteolytic enzymes. We consider the integration of the portal protein of the bacteriophage virus \u03c629 into lipid bilayers of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) membranes with the aim of constructing a functional cargo-device able to transport DNA and later translocate it outwards. Our nano-engineering plan consists of growing GUVs from bilayer membranes built up from proteoliposomes previously prepared by extrusion. We have designed two alternative chemical routes for integrating the portal protein in the lipid bilayer, the first considering the native protein and the second a mutant modified with a hydrophobic belt made of histidine-tags. In our contribution we will present details on the different nano-engineering strategies and experimental evidence about the integration of the portal protein in the membrane with an orientation adequate to allow for functional DNA translocation.",

We therefore compared the photophysical and photochemical properties of free and encapsulated PPME incubated with human carcinoma cells.

Confocal microscopy established undoubtedly the colocalization of PPME, by robust probabilistic exclusion method, within mitochondrion (central siege of apoptosis). After PS activation (4h and 24h), the balance apoptosis-necrosis was double-estimated by FACS device and fluorescence confocal microscopy. Quantification of hydroxyl radical was purchased by spin trapping-ESR spectroscopy and quenching technique. All these techniques required peculiar settings because of the fluorescence activity of PPME. These results allow to ascertain that the vectorization of PPME affords a better cellular penetration and a monomeric state of PPME.

Accumulating evidences demonstrate that cell functions can be modulated by physical factors such as the mechanical forces acting on the cells and the ExtraCellular matrix, as well as the topography or rigidity of the matrix. These extracellular signals can be sensed by mechanosensors on the cell surface or in the cell interior to induce various cell responses. We have developed an original approach based on micro-fabricated substrates of PolyDimethylSiloxane (PDMS) to study cell migration. We used a closely spaced array of flexible micropillars (diameter\u223c1?m) to map the forces exerted by cells on their substrates. In this case, the micropillars act as passive force sensors. Here, we propose to analyze the cell response to an external applied stress by a well-controlled actuation of the substrate. To do so, we used magnetic pillars. Such substrates allow us to modify dynamic adhesion conditions of cells and to better understand the coupling phenomena between mechanical sensing and biochemical activity of a living cell. Using polyacrylamide hydrogels doped with ferromagnetic iron oxide particles or ferrofluids, we can make magnetic pillars with diameters of 5 to 10 microns while a magnetic field can be locally applied with a magnetic needle. Such a technique will be helpful to study the mechanical response of cells to an external force or to local changes in their microenvironment.",

In terms of its pathophysiological relevance, it targets predominantly proteins, but also nucleotides and phospholipids, and is of major importance to both physiology (ageing) and pathology (diseases with a metabolic background, like diabetes). Earlier we demonstrated in vivo that the administration of PAMAM G4 to diabetic rats resulted in a significantly reduced blood glucose, as well as the early (HbA 1c ) and late (AGEs) protein glycation products. In this study we investigated the ability of PAMAM G2 (16 surface NH 2 groups) and G4 (64 NH 2 ) to inhibit glycation of proteins in plasma, and a model protein -BSA. PAMAM G2 and G4 competed chemically with protein NH 2 for the binding of glucose, and hampered protein glycation. In a high-glucose medium they underwent an excessive glycation themselves. This modification was more effective in PAMAM G2, in which surface NH 2 were more mobile and accessible. PAMAM modification with glucose rendered these dendrimers less polycationic in aqueous solutions. PAMAMs neither affected BSA conformation nor formed stable complexes with a protein. We conclude that PAMAMs are very effective glucose scavengers. Thus, even less toxic PAMAMs of lower generations, like G2, may appear useful in further medical applications as the agents attenuating the detrimental effects of sever hyperglycaemia on biomacromolecules.",

We found that the polycation is selectively up-taken by cancer cells (leukemia, hepatocarcinoma, cancer stem cells) while normal cells remain unaffected. Another interesting application of polyelectrolytes are in form of a multilayer coating on the surface of nanogold particles. For this topic, two new approaches were developed for a drug delivery through the blood brain barrier. In the first case, high amounts of creatine were bound to the gold particles and delivered as protective agents for ischemic stroke (Viota et al., J Colloid Interface Sci. 2009, 332 (1):215-23). In the second case coated multifunctional gold particles were prepared as a drug for neurodegenerative disease on the basis of protein aggregates. The use of gold as core for coated nanoparticles offers the possibility to study our systems as \"theranostics\", system which are modified to recognize selectively diseased cells and carry the moieties to treat or destroy the malfunctioning cells.

Incorporation of magnetic particles and drug in the PLGA polymer matrix was confirmed by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The release of the drug from the prepared NPs to the surroundings under the different conditions was studied also. The prepared magnetic PLGA NPs with encapsulated Paclitaxel (spherical shape, size 200 -250 nm) have good stability in the presence of high NaCl concentration at 25 \u2022 C, the toxicity of prepared samples declared 3 times higher value of lethal dose LD 50 in comparison with pure Paclitaxel (LD 50 = 33mg/kg) and showed the significant response to external magnetic field which is useful from the point of view to achieve pharmaceutically acceptable drug delivery systems for tumour treatment. Success of human gene therapy depends upon the development of delivery vehicles or vectors, which can selectively deliver therapeutic genes to target cells with efficiency and safety. Many cationic polymers have been used to condense DNA by electrostatic interaction into small particles (Polyplex), for protecting the DNA from degradation and enhancing uptake via endocytosis. Polyethylenimine (PEI) appears to be one of the most advanced delivery system that can condense DNA efficiently forming PEI-DNA Polyplex complex. The physicochemical properties of different molecular weights of PEI, such as condensation ability, buffer capacity, time kinetics, FTIR and surface charges of the PEI-DNA complexes may be important factors to obtain a higher transfection efficiency of the polycation vectors. Our intent in this study was to characterize PEI-DNA complexes to see whether these physicochemical properties have any influence on their disposition characteristics and cellular uptake process. We found that PEI-DNA complexes, obtained by the 25 k PEI at N/P ratio > 4, were more stable in the presence of tissue culture medium & serum, and did not dissociate in Nacl easily.

The purpose of this work is to relate the DPn of linear chitosan with the cellular uptake, intracellular trafficking and dissociation of chitosan-pDNA complexes, measured by confocal laser scanning microscopy and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). Cells were incubated with oligomers (DPn 31 and 88) either free or complexed with plasmid-DNA. Both chitosan oligomers seem to penetrate cell nucleus in association with or free from pDNA. 24 hours after incubation, accumulation of oligomers in cell nucleus is similar for free and complexed DPn31, whereas it increases for complexed DPn88 compared to free, indicating a possible delayed dissociation of the complexes based on DPn88 in the nucleus and suggesting a dissociation of pDNA-DPn31 in cytoplasm. These data are consistent with previous studies which suggested that longer chitosan chains led to tighter complexes, and hence to a delayed dissociation process and lower transfection efficiencies compared to shorter chitosans.",

While pore ordering and film growth rate are mainly influenced by the electrical parameters of voltage and current, respectively, the typical pore size primarily depends on the electrolyte. In the search for alternative anodization conditions, we have investigated several acids that have never been used before, namely gallic, lactic, propionic, and glycolic acid.

Fundamental parameters like drug encapsulation efficiency and release kinetics are tuned by the physico-chemical features of the drug/carrier complex.

Those phenomena can be repressed with certain types of polymer brushes, in particular PEG (polyethylene glycol) brushes, and a better understanding of the mechanism of adsorption could lead to improvements in the design of biomaterials. We have developed a theory describing this mechanism and carried out measurements to confirm the theoretical predictions [Langmuir 2007, 23, 10603] .

Neutron reflectivity experiments, able to determine the structure and composition of material interfaces with a fraction of nanometer resolution, were carried out and, by using deuterated proteins (Anti-Freeze Protein, Dihydrofolate Reductase and Myoglobin) on different PEG compositions and grafting densities, it was possible to locate the proteins in the brush and to distinguish between the different kinds of adsorption : primary adsorption is dominant for short brushes and ternary adsorption for long brushes.",

Similar results were obtained for all the other timedistance combinations. The work comprises the design of polysaccharide based nanoparticles for drug delivery. Chitosan/arabic gum and arabic gum/maltodextrin nanoparticles were prepared by polyelectrolyte complexation and spray drying [1] , respectively. Dynamic light scattering characterization established that arabic gum/maltodextrin nanoparticles are more polydisperse (diameters ranging from 8 to 400 nm) than chitosan/arabic gum particles (diameters of approximately 500 nm). Scanning electron microscopy measurements demonstrated that the particles are spherical and have a smooth surface. The systems are highly stable to forces up to 80 nN as observed by atomic force microscopy. Due to their nature they are hydrophilic and biodegradable. The nanoparticles were used to entrap short peptide sequences and antioxidants and were proved to be efficient in maintaining the biological activity of the molecules. Kyotorphin (KTP) was found in 1979 in bovine brain. Despite revealing remarkable analgesic properties, analgesia was only induced after central delivery. This limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) combined with the unknown mechanism of action largely confines its pharmacological use. To surpass these problems, we designed new KTP derivatives: KTP-RC and KTP-RC-Lipogen. Biophysical studies were carried out using fluorescence methodologies to characterize the peptides' interaction with biomembrane model systems. Partition coefficient quantification showed a clear preference of the derivatives towards fluid zwitterionic and anionic membranes. Moreover, a relationship between anionic lipid percentage and in-depth insertion in membrane was established. Additionally, studies with fluorescent probe di-8-ANEPPS revealed different membrane-interaction profiles of morphine and KTP-derivatives, suggesting distinct actions between them. The analgesic efficacy of the compounds was studied in vivo after systemic administration in models of acute and tonic pain. Unlike KTP, both KTP-RC and KTP-RC-Lipogen displayed high efficacy from doses as low as 1.67 and 0.85 mg/100g, respectively, indicating BBB crossing. The observed correlation between higher partition/insertion in the membrane and enhanced analgesic action proved the biophysical rationale to be a powerful strategy for early screening in CNS drug development. Metabolic syndrome (MS) is now regarded as a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. As prooxidant/antioxidant balance is disturbed in the course of this disorder, it is possible that melatonin may exhibit protective effect against oxidative damage of blood cells. MS was diagnosed according to International Diabetes Federation definition (2005) . The investigated group consisted of patients before and after the melatonin supplementation (5 mg per day for two months) and was compared to control group of healthy individuals on normal diet. Our experiments show that erythrocytes from patient group exhibit significantly higher TBARS and total cholesterol levels whereas the protein thiol concentration, Na + K + ATPase and glutathione peroxidase activities were decreased in comparison to those of healthy volunteers. After two month melatonin supplementation, TBARS and cholesterol concentrations significantly decreased, whereas the Na + K + ATPase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities increased. The glutathione concentration was also higher. These results show that melatonin supplementation has a protective effect on erythrocytes of MS patients.",

Fedorovich Institute of Biophysics and Cell Engineering, Minsk, Republic of Belarus Nanoparticles are currently used in medicine as agents for targeted drug delivery and imaging. However it has been demonstrated that nanoparticles induce neurodegeneration in vivo and kill neurons in vitro. The cellular and molecular bases of this phenomenon are still unclear. We have used the protein ferritin as a nanoparticle model. Ferritin contains iron particles (Fe 3+ ) with size 7 nm and a protein shell. We investigated how ferritin influences uptake and release of [ 14 C]glutamate and free radical formation as monitored by fluorescent dye DCFDA in rat brain synaptosomes. We found that even a high concentration of ferritin (800 \u00b5g/ml) did not induce spontaneous [ 14 C]glutamate release. In contrast the same concentration of this protein inhibited [ 14 C]glutamate uptake two fold. Furthermore ferritin induced intrasynaptosomal ROS (reactive oxygen species) formation in a dose-dependent manner. This process was insensitive to 30 \u00b5M DPI, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase and to 10 \u00b5M CCCP, a mitochondrial uncoupler. These results indicate that iron-based nanoparticles can cause ROS synthesis and decrease glutamate uptake, potentially leading to neurodegeneration.

In our previous work we have shown that UCP4 appears in brain at embryonic day 14 (E14). We hypothesized that the UCP4 expression can be related to neuronal differentiation. To prove this idea we now investigated protein and mRNA levels in two different systems: (i) mouse embryonic stem cells of line D3 (mESC) and (ii) brains from pre-and postnatal mice. UCP4 was not present in undifferentiated mESC. During differentiation of mESC in neurons the expression of neuronal marker MAP2 and UCP4 started at the same time -as early as on day 7 in culture -and were increasing simultaneously. (ii) The comparative analysis of gene transcripts prepared from whole embryos, brains and different brain regions (neocortex, hippocampus, cerebellum) demonstrated that levels of UCP4 mRNA were increasing from E8 till E19, reached an expression peak between E19 and postnatal day 0 (P0) and remained constant in adult animals. In contrast, expression of UCP5 was increasing permanently until birth, whereas UCP2 expression was invariant in time. Our results suggest that UCP4 contributes to specific neuronal functions.",

Here we show that ABA expands human hemopoietic progenitors in vitro, through a cADPR-mediated increase of the intracellular calcium concentration. Incubation of CD34 + cells with micromolar ABA also induces transcriptional effects, which include NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation and transcription of cytokines encoding genes. Stimulated human MSC produce and release ABA at concentrations sufficient to exert growth-stimulatory effects on co-cultured CD34 + cells, as demonstrated by the inhibition of colony growth in the presence of an anti-ABA monoclonal antibody.

Belostotskaya Sechenov Institute of Evolutionary Physiology and Biochemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, Saint Petersburg, Russia A subpopulation of small cells (volume 141\u00b16 \u00b5m 3 ) have been found in the neonatal cardiac myocytes culture whereas the same parameter of the remaining cells was 819\u00b168 \u00b5m 3 on the 1 st day. In contrast to main part of hypetrofied cardiomyocytes, the small cells were able to proliferate, form colonies and differentiate spontaneously into cardiac myocytes in the culture. On the 8 th day there were slight, slow (2-3 beats/min), arrhythmic contractions in the centre of colonies. Pulsing cells were not united by common contraction and had individual beating profile. On the 11-12 th days, the colonies displayed comprehensive contractile activity with the pulsation rate 25-28 beats/min and reached 46 beats/min on the 23 d -25 th day and 58 beats/min on the 26-30 th days in the culture. It has been shown that receptors of the surface membrane and sarcoplasmic reticulum of colony cells gradually mature. By estimating the Ca 2+ transition under the specific agonists action: acetylcholine, KCl and caffeine, we have detected the activity of basic structural and functional elements of excitation-contraction coupling in contractile cells inside colonies. The small cells ability to proliferate and differentiate under the influence of near mature cardiomyocytes allows us to put forward a hypothesis, that they belong to a category of resident stem cells. Changes in the gating properties of Na + channels were studied in ES-derived neural stem (NS) cells during in vitro neuronal differentiation with the use of the whole-cell and cell-attached variants of patch-clamp technique. NS cells represent a novel stem cell population remaining stable and highly neurogenic over multiple passages.Voltage-clamp recordings during neuronal differentiation of NS cells indicated significant changes in the key properties of Na + currents. A voltage-gated and tetrodotoxine-sensitive Na + current,absent under self-renewal conditions, was first recorded following application of differentiative agents. Current density increased with time of exposure to differentiating conditions. Whole-cell and single channel analysis revealed that the observed increase in current density was due at least in part to changes in steady-state activation and inactivation properties. Namely, half activation potential shifted from -34 mV to -45 mV, while half-inactivation potential shifted from -94 mV to -78 mV. Furthermore, a contribution to the increase in Na + current density could also be given by an enhancement in channel expression, as suggested by an augmentation in the number of single channels per patch area, with increasing neuronal differentiation. Interestingly, those changes in Na + channel activity well correlate with the capability of NS cells to generate action potentials during in vitro neuronal differentiation.",

SCs, however, possess the ability to expand in number (i.e. during development, in adulthood after injury/disease); this increase is not accounted by asymmetric divisions, in which only one daughter cell maintains SC identity. Recent findings in invertebrates indicate that SCs can also generate daughter cells destined to acquire the same fate (symmetric cell division). On the other hand, SC quiescence is critical to maintain tissue homeostasis after injury. Here we show increased symmetric divisions of CSCs in breast tumors (due to inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor) and dependency of leukemia development on quiescent leukemia SCs (due to transcriptional up-regulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 by leukemia-associated fusion proteins). We suggest that SC asymmetric divisions function as a mechanism of tumor suppression, that SC quiescence is critical to the maintenance of the transformed clone and that symmetric divisions of SCs permit their geometric expansion.",

In this scenario damaged tissues will be reconstructed by newly formed cells with the result of a recovery of lost functions. Thus, the rationale for utilizing stem cells for the treatment of neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) stemmed from the idea that they differentiate in neural cells regenerating the damaged tissues at the basis of irreversibile disability. However, while multipotential embryonic stem cells may provide in the future an optimal source of cells competent for myelin and axons repair in MS, their use is still far from being exploitable in a clinical setting. Moreover, it is widely accepted that adult stem cells may in vitro transdifferentiate in neural cells but recent experimental data have challenged the biological importance of this event in vivo. Nevertheless, several experimental studies have provided new evidences supporting the use of adult stem cells derived form different human tissues for the treatment of MS. In the cases of mesenchymal stem cells and neural stem cells current experimental data support an unexpected therapeutic plasticity mediated by diverse paracrine mechanisms including neuroprotection, induction of local neurogenesis and modulation of the immune response. Therefore, current experimental and clinical studies support the use of stem cells for the treatment of neurological diseases such as MS.",

To exclude the possibility of a marked excitonic interaction of the A2 with other chlorophylls, we quantified the decrease in dipole strength after mutagenesis as a function of the frequency and performed a second derivative analysis of the difference absorption spectrum CP29wt minus CP29a2. These data, along with circular dichroism spectra of both complexes, support the idea that the A2 is a monomer in CP29, in disagreement with recent suggestion of involvement in an excitonic dimer (Mozzo et al., BBA 2008) . Chla A2 reorganization energy and inhomogeneous broadening were then determined through a thermal broadening analysis in the 80-285 K temperature range.

In fact, synthesis of ROS, mainly singlet oxygen and superoxide anion and consequent photoinhibition is an intrinsically unavoidable consequence of photosynthesis that must be prevented and/or controlled in order to avoid photodestruction and death. Mechanisms involved include chlorophyll (Chl) triplet quenching, ROS scavenging and controlled heat dissipation of excess Chl singlet excited states. The latter process has been studied for over 40 years with little success in elucidating its mechanism.

This study investigates this problem in isolated core particles by exploiting the different optical properties of the core antenna and the reaction center complex near 680 nm, due to P680 and an isoenergetic pheophytin. This was used as a marker feature for the reaction center complex. If the transfer to the trap-limited model were correct, assuming excited-state thermalization, the specific reaction center fluorescence decay lifetime should be shorter near 680 nm, where there is reaction center complex specificity, than at the other emission wavelengths. Such a selective reaction center feature was not observed in fluorescence decay measurements. At the experimental resolution used here, we conclude that the traplimited energy transfer to the reaction center could, at the most, be 20% limiting.

            "text": "The mechanism of symbiosis between legume plants and Rhizobial bacteria is a relevant topic of interest since it is at the basis of the nitrogen fixation process. This mechanism is strictly related to the production of lipochitooligosaccharides, Nod Factors (NF), which allow the bacterial invasion into the legume host roots. In Medicago truncatula, the recognition of NF from the symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti requires the NFP gene, able to encode a LysM-motif receptor-like kinase. The extracellular part of this protein is characterized by three LysM motifs: only one of them seems to be involved in the NF recognition. Herein, we report an in silico investigation of different structural aspects of this process. First of all, the conformational behaviors of a new generation of NF analogues were elucidated by MDs simulation. Then, a homology model of the LysM2 domain from M. truncatula was proposed and compared with a model of LysM domain from Pisum sativum: docking calculations of natural NF identified a common binding site in which the carbohydrate portion is the main responsible of the binding. Both studies provide support for the idea that the carbohydrate part of NF plays a key role in the interaction with LysM domains, while the lipid moiety modulates ligand specificity probably interacting with a potential second receptor.",

In this study we investigated the interaction of frutalin with different phospho/glyco-lipids using Langmuir monolayers as biomembrane mimetic system. The results attest the specificity of the protein for the carbohydrate D-Gal when attached to the biomembrane model. The adsorption kinetics for frutalin to the mixed monolayers containing glycolipids showed that the interaction depends on the presence of charged groups and on the position of the D-Gal on the polar head of the glycolipid. Using Brewster angle microscopy (BAM), we investigated the morphology of the interface for the binary mixtures containing GalCer, where small domains were formed at high lipid packing, suggesting that frutalin can induce the formation of likelipid rafts domains in vitro. The results obtained with the membrane models were associated with those from fibroblast adhesion induction. The cell adhesion promoted by frutalin is in accordance with the results observed in Langmuir monolayers, which probes the specificity of the interaction between the lectin and D-Gal on cell-membrane surfaces. Based on these results, frutalin can be considered as a promise biotechnological tool to actuate in tissue engineering regeneration. Supported by FAPESP, CNPq and CAPES Aggregation and glycation processes of proteins are of peculiar interest for several scientific fields. Serum albumins are widely studied proteins for their ability to self-assemble in aggregates and also to undergo to non enzymatic glycosylation in cases of diabetes. In this work we report a study on thermal aggregation of glycated bovine serum albumin (BSA) prepared with different concentrations of glucose at pH 7.4. Increasing concentration of sugar modulates the effect of different glycation levels on the protein aggregation. Fluorescence spectroscopy, FTIR absorption, static and dynamic light scattering are used to follow the time evolution of the aggregation process and of protein conformational changes. Conformational changes of secondary and tertiary structures are measured by FTIR absorption; the kinetics of Amide I, Amide II and Amide II' bands are monitored. The kinetics of tryptophans fluorescence give complementary information on the tertiary structure changes and on the polarity modification of the fluorophores environment. The aggregates growth is studied by dynamic light scattering measurements and Rayleigh scattering peak. The results show that the partial unfolding of the protein is not affected by the glycation, while the presence of increasing amounts of glycated molecules progressively inhibits the aggregates formation.",

During the process, significant solvent reorganization is produced along the contact surface. Using MD simulations in explicit solvent combined with statistical mechanics analysis, thermodynamic properties of water molecules around proteins can be computed and analyzed in a comparative view. Based on this idea, we developed a set of analysis tools to link solvation with ligand binding in a key carbohydrate binding protein, human galectin-1 (hGal-1). Specifically, we defined water sites (WS) in terms of the thermodynamic properties of water molecules strongly bound to protein surfaces. We then succesfully extended the analysis of the role of the surface associated water molecules in the ligand binding and recognition process to many other carbohydrate binding proteins. Our results show that the probability of finding water molecules inside the WS, p(v), with respect to the bulk density is directly correlated to the likeliness of finding an oxhydril group of the ligand in the protein-ligand complex. This information can be used to predict possible complex structures when unavailable, and suggest addition of OHcontaining functional groups to displace water from high p(v) WS to enhance drug, specially glycomimetic-drugs, protein affinity and/or specificity.",

Ataxin-1 variants with polyglutamine stretches of pathological length are not associated to disease when the stretch is interrupted by histidines. Mounting evidence suggests that ataxin-1 aggregates interact with the nuclear membrane. To get insight into the mechanisms leading to neurological disorders, we studied model lipid membranes containing an expanded pathological form of ataxin-1 or expanded normal forms interrupted by histidines. Electrical measurements on planar bilayers showed the occurrence of current steps, much larger for the pathological form, indicating the formation of pore-like structures. Atomic force microscopy measurements showed that the longer the polyglutamine tract, the smaller was the force required to penetrate the bilayer with the AFM tip. The smallest penetration force, and then the strongest membrane destabilization, was observed for membranes containing the expanded pathological form. Experiments on COS1 cells provided evidence that pathological protein aggregates damage the nuclear membrane eventually causing cell autophagy.",

A plausible source of oxidative stress in nigral dopaminergic neurons is the redox reactions that specifically involve dopamine (DA) and produce various toxic molecules, i.e., free radicals and quinone species. \u03b1-Synuclein (\u03b1Syn), a small protein found in Lewy bodies characteristic of PD, is also thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of PD. To investigate the possibility of a synergistic role of oxidative stress and \u03b1Syn in PD, we analyzed the modulation of DA toxicity by \u03b1Syn overexpression in dopaminergic human neuroblastoma cells. Our results indicate that the increased expression of \u03b1Syn enhances the cellular toxicity induced by the accumulation of intracellular DA. We then correlated our results with the structural modifications induced by the oxidation products of DA on \u03b1Syn by studying two potential pathways for the oxidative chemistry associated with DA. The first one is the auto-oxidation reaction which leads to the concomitant formation of radical and quinone species. The second is the enzymatic oxidation, mediated by tyrosinase, which leads only to the accumulation of quinones. Our data suggest a link between DA and \u03b1Syn in the progression of PD and provide novel insights on both the mechanisms involved in the oxidative chemistry and the aggregation properties of \u03b1Syn.",

Heparins and low-molecular weight heparins which mimic HS sequences could interact with amyloid peptides putatively involved in neurodegenerative processes. The aim of this work is to study the influence of chain length and structure of heparin oligosaccharides on the aggregation of amyloid. To this purpose, the interaction with amyloid peptide A\u03b2 1\u221240 with a number of heparin/heparin oligosaccharides had been investigated using dynamic light scattering (DLS) which permits to determine the size and the stability of molecular aggregates in solution. As indexes of aggregation in solution, two parameters were chosen, i.e., the area under the autocorrelation function (AF) and the average hydrodynamic ratio (Rh). We evaluated the aggregation kinetic of different preparations of A\u03b2 and the pH of solubilization. A clear indication was obtained for the trend of aggregation of the peptide A\u03b2 1\u221240 alone and in the presence of oligosaccharides. The size of the aggregate in the presence of the tetrasaccharide is definitely lower than for the peptide alone. The size of the aggregates increases with increasing size of the oligosaccharides. In fact, the octasaccharide promotes further aggregation. It is crucial for pharmaceutical protein formulations to have low aggregate content. Using the monoclonal IgG1 antibody Rituximab as a model system, we have studied the mechanisms by which antibodies aggregate at physiological pH when incubated at 52-65 \u2022 C. Light scattering showed two coupled stages: An initial fast stage followed by several hours of exponential growth of the scattered intensity. Data analysis showed the fast formation of a large species, which subsequently increased in size. The aggregate number density had a maximum suggesting that aggregates increase in size by coagulation. The analysis also predicted the actual underlying increase in aggregate mass to be linear and reach saturation. This was confirmed by size-exclusion chromatography of incubated samples. In an Arrhenius plot the activation energy of the first stage was similar to the unfolding energy of the CH2 domain, suggesting a pivotal role of this domain in the aggregation process. CD and fluorescence showed only minor structural changes in the temperature interval studied. We conclude that coagulation is the main mechanism driving Rituximab aggregation and that aggregation is due to small structural changes.",

Previous studies report a range of different but plausible structures, which depend on the molecular environment of the peptide. This sensitivity to sample preparation suggests that the structure relevant to disease is found in lipid bilayer membranes. While model membrane vesicles are too large to be studied by conventional solution NMR, solid-state NMR is one of the few technologies available to study such systems. We present recent measurements which suggest a novel peptide structure in a lipid bilayer environment: (i) rotational-echo double-resonance (REDOR) distance measurements between selectively enriched 13 C-carbonyl and 15 N-amide positions constrain dihedral angles of intervening residues and suggest that at least part of the A\u03b2(1-42) peptide folds into a \u03b2-sheet like conformation, in contrast to the helical and coiled structures in previous reports; and (ii) double quantum filtered DRAWS measurements indicate that the extended strand does not assemble into an in-register parallel sheet as reported for amyloid fibrils.",

It is responsible for their specific architecture. It is already known that collagen I is capable of forming cholesteric liquid crystalline phases that once stabilized by a pH increase, lead to collagen matrices that mimic the organization of the organic matrix found in bone [1] . In the present work, we analyze physico-chemical ways to modulate long range organizations obtained in this liquid state. We study the effect of collagen concentration, pH (2.6 / 3.6) and acids (hydrochloride acid / acetic acid) over the liquid crystalline order. In a original approach, correlation of collagen endofluorescence and SHG signals has enabled us to quantify cholesteric pitch and phase transition as a function of collagen concentration within a gradient. Cholesteric pitch have proved to be very responsive to physico-chemical conditions. Indeed, the results allowed us to quantify a I / cholesteric transition as a subsequent transition from cholesteric to a phase hexagonal or colummar. Prion diseases are deadly neurodegenerative diseases affecting human and mammalian species. According to the 'protein-only' hypothesis, the key event in the pathogenesis is the conversion of the \u03b1-helix-rich monomer (PrP c ) into a polymeric \u03b2-sheet-rich pathogenic conformer (PrP sc ). We have used a combination of biophysical techniques with Molecular Dynamics simulations (MD) to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of PrP c unfolding and polymerization. Under well established conditions, three \u03b2-sheet-rich soluble oligomers were generated from the partial unfolding of the monomer, which were found to form in parallel. To obtain a deeper insight into the molecular events, doublecystein mutants were designed, thus 'locking' different regions of PrP. Single mutations were also performed, which affected dramatically and selectively the PrP oligomerization pathway. Furthermore, we have now identified the minimal region that leads to the same oligomerization profile as the full-length PrP, namely, H2H3. The existence of at least three distinct oligomerization pathways and the effect of single mutations reveal the conformational diversity of PrP and a possible relationship with prion strain phenomena. The identification of domains involved in the conversion process may lead to a better understanding of the effect of mutations or gene polymorphism on the evolution of prion pathology.",

We investigate this issue with Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy in solution and on cell membranes. Our initial data, varying the pH and the ionic strength of the solution, show that a charged colloid model can explain the overall stability of these species.

Although these aggregates have first been found in connection with protein-misfolding diseases, such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's Disease, there is evidence that the ability to form fibrils is a generic property of any polypeptide rather than a result of specific, disease-related amino-acid sequences. Fibrils can easily be formed in vitro from nondisease-related proteins and even from synthetic peptides. These artificial fibrils can thus serve as model systems to investigate the biophysical properties of amyloid fibrils. The system presented here is built from the artificial peptide TTR 105\u2212115 , which contains 11 amino-acids and which forms well-defined nanorods of ca 10 nm diameter. We present Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) results of their inner morphology by chemically dissecting the rods into their constituent filaments without completely breaking up the aggregates. In contrast to the stiff rods, their constituent filaments of ca 1-2 nm diameter were much more flexible. This shows that the particular way filaments are arranged around each other can massively change the mechanical rigidity of the resulting structures in amyloid fibrils, which could be one cause of the different strains in amyloid diseases. The formation of insulin fibrils is characterized by an initial apparent lag-phase, related to the formation of oligomers, protofibrils and aggregation nuclei. Afterwards, the aggregation proceeds via fibril elongation, thickening and/or flocculation, and eventual gelation. Here, we focus on the formation of such a gel, made of insulin amyloid fibrils, upon incubation at high temperature and low pH. By light scattering and rheological techniques, we monitor the development of the structural, dynamical and mechanical properties of fibrillar aggregates, up to the dynamic arrest of the sample and to the appearance of a non-ergodic behaviour, which marks the onset of gelation. Our experiments were able to reveal the structural details hidden in the apparent lag-phase, displaying the slow fibril nucleation and elongation. This initial stage is followed by the known exponential growth of structures of different sizes. These two kinetic stages of structural growth are mirrored by the kinetics of the viscoelastic properties and, in particular, by the growth of the elastic modulus. Our results show that the appearance of a noteworthy elastic network, is associated with the initial fibril nucleation and elongation more than with the formation of large structures, which causes the eventual gelation.",

However, a complete understanding of the basic principles behind these methodologies is still elusive. The crystallization of membrane proteins in the lipid cubic phases involves following major steps: removal of membrane proteins from the native membrane using detergentlike molecules, followed by their insertion and equilibration into a lipid bilayer. The crystallization itself commences with precipitant induced osmotic dehydration which in turn stimulates the nucleation that subsequently leads to a crystal growth. Using time-resolved X-ray scattering (SAXS) and ultraviolet spectroscopy we have been able to gain new insights into the mechanism behind protein insertion into these complex three dimensional lipid structures including information on the timescales of protein folding relative to crystal growth and the effect of protein insertion on the morphology of the surrounding lipid matrix. Several proteins can form amyloid fibrils under given environmental or thermodynamic conditions that affect their native conformation. Lysozyme forms amyloid fibrils upon incubation of solutions at acid pH and at about 65 \u2022 C for a few days. Differential Scanning Calorimetry experiments confirm that lysozyme is mainly unfolded above 60 \u2022 C at pH 2. We monitored the growth of aggregate size by Dynamic Light Scattering for some days at different temperatures. Our results show that the fibrillogenesis is characterized by an initial apparent lag phase and a subsequent growth with quadratic dependence upon time of the scattering intensity. This behaviour recalls a simple kinetic model of nucleation and elongation, with nuclei in equilibrium with monomers. At the end of the incubation at high temperature, we collected Atomic Force Microscopy images which show fibrils with a diameter of a few tens of nanometers and a length of a few microns, characterized by a periodicity along the elongation axis. Interestingly, the fibrils morphology exhibits no branching or thickening. This is consistent with the non-exponential growth observed in light scattering experiments. In order to elicit the role of repulsive electrostatic interaction in protein unfolding and self-assembly we extended our study at different pH. In this work we used AFM to follow the amyloidogenesis pathway of transthyretin (TTR) to form protofilaments. Single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) of native TTR and protofilaments were also compared in order to evaluate dynamic and structural differences. We observed that this pathway proceeds through the formation of transient amorphous aggregates, followed by the occurrence of annular oligomers. Although implicated in cytoxicity, the role of such oligomers within the amyloidogenesis pathway is poorly understood. We show that the annular species display a tendency to stack, forming tubular-like structures that precede the formation of protofilaments. The protofilament height and pitch resemble those of TTR amyloid reported in previous structural studies. Upon solvent exchange, we also observed protofilament disassembly that revealed structures reminiscent of the initial TTR annular oligomers. SMFS of protofilaments showed a time-dependent increase in the length of the manipulated structures, suggesting that associations between monomers stabilize with time. Force spectra of native TTR and protofilaments contained transitions spaced by \u223c4 nm, indicative of sequential unfolding of individual \u03b2-strands. Based on these results a model of TTR protofilament assembly is proposed.",

The low prevalence of large proteins is disproportionate with their high occurrence in the human proteome. In order to explore the propensity of large proteins to form amyloid-like fibrils, the 486-residue hexokinase-B from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (YHKB) has been induced to aggregate under two separate conditions, at low pH in the presence of salts and at pH 5.5 in the presence of trifluoroethanol. Such conditions are among the most promising to form amyloid-like fibrils by normally globular proteins. Under both conditions YHKB aggregates very rapidly into species with significant \u03b2-sheet structure, as detected by circular dichroism, and a weak Thioflavin T and Congo red binding. Atomic force microscopy revealed globular aggregates eventually clustering into large amorphous aggregates at low pH, while in the presence of trifluoroethanol ribbon-like structures with distinct morphology from typical amyloid fibrils were observed. They had irregular width, no twist, and were connected by thinner fibril segments perpendicular to them. In general, YHKB aggregates displayed an unusual softness, as they were very easily perturbed by the AFM tip. These results suggest that inability to form amyloid fibrils may prevent large proteins from being associated with protein deposition diseases.",

Mariani 3 1 Dip. SAIFET, Univ. Pol., Ancona, Italy, 2 ESRF, Grenoble, France, 3 Dip. Biochim. Biofis., II Univ., Napoli, Italy Under some conditions, a protein converts from its soluble form into highly ordered aggregates called amyloid fibrils, which are associated with many human diseases. In order to tackle the prevention and treatment of these diseases, we need to understand the mechanism of the pathological aggregation of proteins. In vitro amyloid fibril formation is preceded by the formation of metastable non fibrillar forms, which are responsible for cytotoxicity underlying neurodegeneration. The molecular mechanisms leading proteins into prefibrillar aggregates are still unclear. We present a SAXS study performed at ID02 beamline of ESRF on the apomyoglobin mutant W7FW14F, which at physiological pH, firstly aggregates in prefibrillar forms that are cytotoxic and then forms amyloid fibrils. The first stages of W7FW14F oligomerization are induced by a pH jump. Data show that big changes in W7FW14F in solution happen in less than 100 ms. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the data yields a set of functions, from which all the scattering curves can be reproduced. The major result of our study is the determination of the presence of different oligomers in each step of the process. Hence, time-resolved SAXS experiments together with the estimation of different oligomers via SVD method, can be a new and useful approach to investigate the first stages of amyloidogenesis.",

Ta Amyloid diseases (Alzheimer, Parkinson, type II diabetes, prion) correlate with protein aggregation. All the proteins associated with these pathologies aggregate into amyloid fibrils with a common \u00df-cross structure. According to many in vitro studies, the toxicity of various amyloids seems to be linked to some intermediates formed during the aggregation pathway and to their interaction with membranes. Our aim is to understand the link between structure and toxicity of amyloids by studying their interaction with model membranes. For this, we use as an amyloid model, the Prion-Forming Domain PFD218-289 (Wild Type WT) of Het-s, a prion protein of the fungal P. anserina. When expressed in yeast, WT is not toxic whereas one of these mutants, M8 is toxic. In vitro, M8 forms very unusual short amyloid fibers contrary to WT which polymerizes as long fibers. Furthermore, ATR spectra have shown that M8 is essentially assembled into mixed parallel and anti-parallel \u00df-sheets whereas WT displays a predominant parallel organization. We are currently studying the interaction between WT or M8 with lipid Langmuir film by Polarized Modulation-InfraRed Reflexion Absorption Spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS). This technique allows determining the secondary structure of proteins and their orientation in the membrane. The study of interactions with different charged phospholipids is following.",

We present data on human serum albumin (HSA) aggregation induced by a combination of thermal and metal ions effects investigated by optical density, fluorescence and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The turbidity experiments as a function of temperature show that the HSA aggregation starts at about 70 \u2022 C which is higher than the denaturation temperature (\u223c 60 \u2022 C). In the presence of copper and zinc metal ions the onset temperature for protein aggregation is markedly reduced as the metal:protein molar ratio is increased from 1:1 to 10:1. Moreover, the copper is more effective in inducing protein aggregation compared to zinc ion. The HSA aggregation analyzed by ThT fluorescence at different incubation temperatures lacks a lag phase and the kinetic traces can be fitted by double exponential functions. The ThT fluorescence increase evidences the formation of protein aggregates with fibrillar features. EPR experiments for the Cu(II)-HSA complex show the binding of Cu(II) in the protein native state in a square planar coordination with 4 equatorial N atoms, and is not influenced by the heat treatment of the protein. The overall results suggest that HSA aggregation is compatible with a downhill process that does not require the formation of an aggregation nucleus.",

Schurtenberger Adolphe Merkle Institute, University of Fribourg, CH-1723 Marly 1, Switzerland A broad class of diseases, such as cataract, Alzheimer's disease and sickle-cell disease, involve protein association phenomena as an essential aspect. The basic element common to all members of this class of molecular condensation diseases is the subtle interplay between protein interactions that produces condensation into dense, frequently insoluble mesoscopic phases. Among this class of diseases, cataract is particularly important as the world's leading cause of blindness. This disease is most often the consequence of an uncontrolled aggregation (or phase separation) of the proteins in the eye lens that results in a loss of its transparency. The high concentration protein mixtures present in the eye lens are normally stable and produce a high refractive index that aids the eye in adaptive focusing of light. Moreover, the proteins themselves exhibit a rich variety of repulsive interactions, attractive interactions, sizes, phase transitions and self-association. These mixtures also exhibit the pathological aggregation and opacification of the cataract disease that has inspired their study. In my presentation I will illustrate how we can use a combination of small-angle neutron and Xray scattering experiments combined with molecular dynamics computer simulations to identify, measure and model the molecular interactions and emergent optical and viscoelastic properties and the phase behavior of the relevant, complex cytoplasmic mixtures.",

Winter 1 1 Department of Physical Chemistry I -Biophysical Chemistry, TU Dortmund University, Dortmund, Germany, 2 Max-Planck Institute for Molecular Physiology, Dortmund, Germany Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by islet amyloid deposition and beta cell death, the main culprit being a small 37 a.a. peptide hormone, islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), which forms fibrils under pathological conditions. We studied the interaction of IAPP with giant (GUVs) and large (LUVs) unilamellar vesicles as well as with INS-1E cells. By using confocal / two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy and GUVs, we tested the influence of charge (DOPC:DOPG 7:3) and model raft systems, displaying liquid-ordered (l o ) / liquid-disordered (l d ) phase coexistence (such as DOPC:DPPC:cholesterol 1:2:1), respectively, on the kinetics of IAPP fibril formation. A preferential partitioning into the l d phase was observed and fibrils grew along with lipid uptake. Fluorescence spectroscopy leakage experiments with carboxyfluorescein-filled LUVs and the corresponding ThT kinetics of IAPP fibril formation were carried out as well. Moreover, using the WST-1 reduction assay and fluorescence microscopy, we could show that the red wine compound resveratrol is a potent inhibitor of IAPP fibrillation and its cellular toxicity on INS-1E cells, these findings highlighting the potential role of resveratrol in future clinical applications, i.e., in the treatment of T2DM. A remarkably high viscosity has been induced in aqueous solutions of lysozyme by the addition of certain structurally related organic solvents, such as tetramethylurea (TMU), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylformamide (DMF), and hexamethylphosphortriamide. DMSO-induced gelation is observed in samples fulfilling the two following requirements: (1.) lysozyme concentration in excess of 5 mM, and (2.) volume fractions of DMSO exceeding 0.7. Based on spectroscopic data, the whole process was characterized as consisting of two mutually independent stages. The first involves an extensive transition of the polypeptide backbone, from a predominantly helical to increased random coiled and beta-sheet structures, with the occurrence of non-orthodox protein secondary structures at regions above the solvent critical point. The second stage consists of short-lived interchain contacts leading to an entanglement of the macromolecular system as a whole.",

Bisaglia, L. Bubacco Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Padova, Padova, Italy Alpha-synuclein (syn) is linked to Parkinson's disease (PD) by two evidences: the accumulation of amyloid fibrils of the protein and the autosomal dominant forms of the disease (A53T, A30P and E46K mutants). Protein oligomers seem to be the most toxic species, causing dopaminergic neuronal death, probably disrupting cell membrane (Volles & Lansbury, 2002) . The aggregation of syn follows a nucleation dependent mechanism, i. e., aggregation is favoured only after the formation of an oligomer composed of a critical number of monomers (Wood et al., 1999) . As the constitution of the nucleus is a rare event, early aggregation stages are difficult to study. To explore the early stages of the aggregation process a fluorescence polarization (FP) based method (Luk et al., 2007) was applied to study syn oligomerization. FP depends on the size of the fluorescent molecule, therefore it is suitable for the detection of oligomers formation. We measured aggregation kinetic properties under several different conditions. A 100 to 1 mixture of syn and Oregon Green labelled syn was used to analyze the aggregation behaviour of wild type (wt) and PD mutants. The wt protein shows the fastest aggregation rate. This aggregation process is slowed down by the presence of the chaperone 14-3-3eta in wt syn samples. Finally, dimers formed by a disulfide bond at the N-terminus or C-terminus of syn, when tested for their aggregation behaviour, show a different propensity to aggregate.",

B. japonicum shows step-up photophobic response, whereas F. salina, that contains fabrein, shows step-down photophobic responses and positive phototaxis. We showed by confocal microscopy that the pigments are localized not only in pigment granules, but also in the cilia. This fact implies that the structure of the pigment in the cilia differs from that in the cell body, (pigment granules are too big to fit in the axoneme) and suggests that ciliary pigments might play a decisive role in photoreception. Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) shows that there is a spatial distribution of lifetimes, which are shorter for the pigment in the cilia. This might indicate a functional role for these pigments. Furthermore, lifetimes for F. salina are always longer than those of Blepharisma. In order to further characterize the structure of ciliary pigments by means of spectroscopic methods, we have also performed spatially resolved static and time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements.",

PS allows the increasing of the immobilised biomolecule number on its surface and the creation of stable covalent bonds due to its controllable chemistry. Beside this, PS is suitable for electrical (conductance, impedance), electrochemical and optical amplification of the detected signal. The experimental results on the fabrication of the PS microstructures such as: (i) protein immobilization and detection using microarray technique; (ii) DNA biomolecule detection by impedance or by fluorescence spectroscopy; (iii) very sensitive SERS biosensors (RAMAN signal of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid); (iv) sensitive element for neurons in NutMix culture are in detail presented. Various characterisation techniques have been used, optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction, Raman, laser fluorescence and impedance spectroscopy for investigation molecule attachment on the Au/PS structures. We have demonstrated that different morphologies of PS as-prepared or coated with gold nanoparticles have an important role in biomolecule/cell detection, due to its large internal surface combined with specific optical properties, being in the same time sensing element/support for immobilization of sensing biomolecules as well as transducer for biochemical interactions. Heterotrimeric G-proteins interact with their G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) via key binding elements comprising the C-terminal segment of the \u03b1-subunit and the two lipid anchors at the \u03b1\u2212 and \u03b3\u2212subunit. Direct information about diffusion and interaction of GPCRs and their G-proteins is mandatory, as these properties will affect the timing of events in the complex signal transduction cascade. In the case of the photoreceptor rhodopsin, receptor packing in the membrane and the related diffusion coefficients are discussed controversially (1, 2). By using single particle tracking we show that the encounters of rhodopsin with the fluorescently labeled Cterminus of the \u03b1-subunit as well as with the Holo-G-protein transducin change upon rhodopsin light-activation. Our results indicate confined areas of interaction for the C-terminal segment of the \u03b1-subunit with inactive rhodopsin disk membranes and less restricted diffusion of the receptor-bound Cterminal segment after light-activation. This suggests dynamic short-range order in rhodopsin packing and specific structures for efficient interaction (3) In vivo, skeletal muscle actively shortens and also resists lengthening, for example when landing after a jump. We study the energy during shortening and during lengthening by measuring the rate of Pi release which results from ATP hydrolysis. We show here the rate of Pi releases in an in vitro protocol that involves muscle stretched followed by muscle shortening. It is hypothesised that the magnitude of deceleration of Pi release in the stretch phase is less than the acceleration during the release due the energy input of the motor that is used to apply the length changes. Therefore the end point of Pi release is similar to isometric conditions. Pi release responses to a ramped stretch (5%) followed 100 ms later by a symmetrical release at low velocities (0.5 L 0 /s \u22121 ) were measured in permeabilised fibre bundles of rabbit psoas at 20 \u2022 C. Laser diffraction and high speed video were also recorded to confirm length change. We show that the rate of Pi release drops during the stretch phase, returns to isometric levels during the length hold phase, and finally accelerates during the ramped release. Tracking of sarcomere length change using video analysis demonstrated that laser diffraction is unreliable at times during stretches due to lack of uniformity of the sarcomere spacing.",

Phylogenetic analysis indicates frequent lateral gene transfer of proton pumps among prokaryotic and unicellular eukaryotic species, followed by coupling of the pump's mechanism to the cell's existing signal transduction machinery to create photosensors. This evolutionary path is strongly supported by our studies of sensory rhodopsins in various organisms which demonstrate remarkably diverse signaling mechanisms with diverse transducer partners. The best studied are the phototaxis receptors in haloarchaeal prokaryotes (SRI and SRII) and in eukaryotic algae (channelrhodopsins). SRI and SRII transmit signals by protein-protein interaction to control a phosphorylation cascade that modulates motility. Channelrhodopsins are light-gated cation channels that depolarize the membrane mediating calcium ion influx into the flagellar axoneme.

The interaction of surface plasmons of gold nanoparticles with fluorophores a few nanometers away from the surface modifies their brightness and excited-state lifetime, and this effect can be exploited to obtain nanodevices for proteinprotein recognition. We studied different types of constructs based on gold NPs on which derivatives of fluorescein were bound. The interaction of this fluorophore with the gold surface plasmon resonances, mainly occurring through quenching, affects its excited-state lifetime, that is measured by fluorescence burst analysis in standard solutions. The binding of proteins to the gold NPs through antigen-antibody recognition further modifies the dye excited-state lifetime. This change can therefore be used to measure the protein concentration. Streptavidin-functionalized gold NPs of size 5-10 nm are used to bind biotin-fluorescein and biotin-antibodies for specific proteins. We have first tested the constructs for bovine serum albumine (BSA) detection.

The NKCX regulation was investigated in whole-cell recorded OS, using ionic conditions that activated maximally forward and reverse exchange. In all species examined of amphibia and reptilia, the forward (reverse) exchange current increased about linearly for negative (positive) voltages and exhibited outward (inward) rectification for positive (negative) voltages. Since hyperpolarization increases Ca 2+ extrusion rate, the recovery of the dark level of Ca 2+ (and of the generator potential) after light stimuli results accelerated. Mg-ATP doubled the size of forward and reverse exchange current without modifying their voltage dependence, indicating that Mg-ATP regulates the number of active exchanger sites and/or the NCKX turnover number.

In response to adduct formation, a J\u03b1 helix adjacent to the LOV2 domain dissociates and allows for autophosphorylation by the kinase domain.

The aim was to elucidate whether psychostimulant drug amphetamine (AMPH) modulates formation of NO and lipid peroxidation (LPO) products as well as the neurotransmitter release in rat brain. The output of glutamate, aspartate, GABA and acetylcholine (ACH) was monitored in striatum by microdialysis with HPLC detection. AMPH produced 2fold elevation of NO generation and LPO formation in brain areas. While AMPH increased the aspartate, GABA and ACH release, the glutamate output was not affected. Pretreatment with the neuronal NOS inhibitor was highly effective in abating the rise of NO and neurotransmitter levels but failed to influence the LPO intensity elicited by AMPH. The findings suggest that activation of NO synthesis is a potent factor in the AMPH-induced neurotransmitter release.",

Cuza'University, Faculty of Physics, Laboratory of Biophysics and Medical Physics, Blvd. Carol I no. 11, Iasi, Romania Amphotericin B (AmB) is an antifungal antibiotic which, despite the severe side effects, is still used for the treatment of systemic fungal infections. In this study we investigated the influence of pH upon the selectivity and the transport properties of AmB channels inserted in reconstituted, ergosterolcontaining zwitterionic lipid membranes. Our electrophysiology experiments carried out on single and multiple AmB channels prove that at pH=2.8 these channels are anion selective, whereas at neutral and alkaline pH's (pH=7 and pH=11) they become cation selective. We attribute this to the pH-dependent ionization state of the carboxyl and amino groups present at the mouth of AmB molecules. Surprisingly, our data reveal that the single-molecule ionic conductance of AmB channels varies in a non-monotonic fashion with pH changes, which we attribute to the pH-dependent variation of the surface and dipole membrane potential. We demonstrate that when added only from one side of the membrane, in symmetrical salt solutions across the membrane and low pH values, AmB channels display a strong rectifying behavior, and their insertion is strongly favored when positive potentials are present on the side of their addition. We report a detection method for the redox state of proteins which combines FRET-based fluorescence/confocal microscopy on dye-labeled protein with cyclic voltammetry. By using this combined method, electron transfer properties can be revealed from protein to electrode or from redox enzyme to substrate. We applied the fluorescent detection to azurin, a blue copper protein from the bacterium Ps. aeruginosa, fluorescently labeled on the N-terminus for monitoring the redox state of the protein. The dye fluorescence is quenched by energy transfer to the copper in oxidized, but not in reduced azurin. Fluorescence results demonstrated that Cy5-labeled wtazurin switched in fluorescence intensity by up to 85% by varying the applied potential. Labeled zinc-azurin was used as a control sample and did not show any fluorescence switching. For single molecule studies wt-azurin was labeled with ATTO 655 dye and a mixed SAM was used, with 8-Hydroxy-1octanethiol as a blocking agent to prevent non-specific binding of protein on the surface, and 1,10 decanedithiol for the specific covalent binding to the protein. Preliminary data show that single-molecule fluorescence switching with the potential is indeed possible.",

Rev. Lett., 1995; Cluzel et al., Science, 1996) . Single molecules of double stranded \u03bb-phage DNA (in a solution with 150 mM NaCI, 10 mM tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0. and 27 \u2022 C) are stretched either in length clamp or in force clamp mode. When the DNA molecule is stretched in length clamp mode with a ramp lengthening, it shows the previously described highly cooperative overstretching transition at \u223c60 pN, attributed to unwinding from the B-form to the 1.7 times longer S-form. Stretching the molecule in force clamp mode with a staircase of force steps at 5 s intervals (step size 1-2 pN, rise time 1-2 ms) shows, for any given clamped force F in the region of the overstretching transition, different amounts of DNA elongation (\u2206L) with exponential time courses. The analysis of the elongation rates allows to recover all the necessary parameters for an effective two-state model able to reproduce the out-of-equilibrium properties of the system. The results imply an unwinding cooperativity of 27 bps. This value is significantly lower than that obtained assuming force independent rate constants.

The protein flexibility is taken into account by generating random conformations based on geometrical constraints only applying the CONCOORD [2] program.

This protein plays a central role is the DNA strand exchange occurring during homologous recombination. Here we report the polymerization and depolymerization of hRad51 on duplex DNA observed with a new generation of magnetic tweezers, allowing the measurement of DNA twist with a resolution of 5 \u2022 in real time. At odds with earlier claims, we show that, after initial deposition of a multimeric nucleus, nucleoprotein filament growth occurs by addition of single proteins, involving DNA twisting steps of 65\u00b15 \u2022 . Simple numerical simulations support that this mechanism is an efficient way to minimize nucleoprotein filament defects. This behavior, consisting of different stoichiometry for nucleation and growth phases, may be instrumental in vivo. Fast growth would permit efficient continuation of strand exchange by Rad51 alone while the limited nucleation would require additional proteins such as Rad52, thus keeping this initiation step under the strict control of regulatory pathways. Besides, our results combined with earlier structural information, suggest that DNA is somewhat less extended (4.5 versus 5.1\u00c5 per bp) and more untwisted (18.2 versus 15 \u2022 per bp) by hRad51 than by RecA, and confirm a stoichiometry of 3-4 bp per protein in the hRad51-dsDNA nucleoprotein filament.",

Bulk in vitro studies showed that various mutants of T5 eject their genome in solution following a single or a multistep process. By immobilizing single bacteriophages on a surface and following their ejection by fluorescence microscopy we showed that in all cases the ejection occurs in one step, but some mutants seem to have a subpopulation for which the triggering signal of the ejection is transmitted more slowly to the capsid entrance.

To mediate adhesion, UPEC express quaternary surface organelles that are assembled from \u223c10 3 identical subunits into a helix-like coil, with a single adhesin located at the tip. It is believed that the single adhesin mediate attachment to host cells while the helix-like structures act as shock absorbers to dampen the irregularly shear forces induced by urine flow. To unravel the biomechanical properties of such quaternary structures, in particular in terms of their force-elongation and kinetic behavior, Force-Measuring Optical Tweezers (FMOT) have been used. A plethora of different types of pili have been identified in the literature and we show, using FMOT, that those dissimilarities might reflect the host environment. For example, we have found differences among pili expressed at diverse environment inside the urinary tract, which imply that pili presumably have evolved to resist specific forces under in vivo conditions. It is thus worth striving for understanding bacterial adhesion in order to figure out alternative to the over-abundance of antibiotics worldwide. Single molecules studies have probed protein conformational fluctuations and monitored the oscillating activity of enzymes that remained masked in ensemble measurements. Various statistical models have attempted to connect the conformational motions to the fluctuating activity of enzymes and suggested that they adopt inter-converting conformations each one of them exhibiting different catalytic activity. The main drawback of these studies is the non specific interactions that may bias the observed catalytic behavior. We have developed new innovating tools to study the behavior of single enzymes. As a first step we utilized liposomes as scaffold to confine enzymes while keeping them under physiological conditions. Keeping them in their native conformation allowed us to monitor the inherent properties of their behavior. As a second step we developed a new model that accurately connects enzyme activity behavior to conformational motions. Using this approach we accurately predicted the behavior of single lipases in a highly controlled environment. We modulated the enzyme's conformational mobility and activity by systematically varying its accessibility to liposomes. As we anticipated, that resulted in altering the time the enzyme spends on active conformations.Our results provide new insights on interpreting the behavior of enzymes.",

This precess is called self splicing [1] . There are several methods to to study kinetic properties of ribozymes at the singlemolecule level. In this work we focus on FRET (F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer) of single, immobilized molecules. Single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy gives an insight into the behavior of individual molecules rather than the average behavior of an ensemble of molecules, which makes it possible to observe the kinetic heterogeneity. We simulated FRET trajectories for single immobilized ribozymes. In our computer simulations we consider two-and three-state kinetic models motivated by actual experiments, published in [2] and [3] . We fitted the histograms of on and off times to recover the kinetic parameters of the models. We investigated the bias and standard deviation of the recovered parameters when one or two thresholds are applied to FRET trajectories between adjacent states. We found that two thresholds give better parameter estimates than one-threshold analysis. References FRAP probes the average dynamical properties of a population of fluorescently labeled molecules whereas SPT obtains these properties from observations of the trajectories of individual molecules tagged with a colloidal particle (the \"bead\"). When results of FRAP are compared with those of SPT, FRAP yields significantly higher diffusion constants than SPT. To understand the origin of this difference, we have developed and tested a model system to evaluate the influence of the bead on the dynamics of a diffusing molecule. We use a dsDNA tether to attach a bead to a supported lipid bilayer (SLB). The DNA tether is modified at one end by cholesterol for anchoring to and diffusion in the membrane, and at the other end by biotin for tagging with a bead.",

These in vitro data provide insight into the different possible nucleoprotein complexes and into the lambda repressor-mediated looping mechanism which leads to predictions for that in vivo. The significance of this work consists not only of the new insight into a paradigmatic epigenetic switch that governs lysogeny vs. lysis, but also the detailed mechanics of regulatory DNA loops mediated by proteins bound to multipartite operators and capable of different levels of oligomerization. Mechanical force at the molecular level is involved in the action of many enzymes. For example, the Phi29 DNA polymerase mechanically unwinds the DNA helix as it moves processively along the DNA replicating one strand of the DNA molecule. Using Optical Tweezers we have developed a single molecule mechanical assay to elucidate the physical mechanism of DNA unwinding by the Phi29 DNA polymerase as the protein replicates the DNA. A single DNA hairpin is hold between an optical trap and a mobile surface. As a single polymerase works on the DNA hairpin, its replication and unwinding reactions can be measured in real time by measuring the change in extension in the DNA polymer, revealing the fluctuations of its rate in response to the DNA sequence. Moreover, by gradually pulling on the opposite strands of the DNA hairpin we can promote the controlled mechanical unwinding of the DNA helix and determine the effect of increasing unwinding forces on the polymerization and unwinding rates. The effect of force and DNA sequence on the activities of the wild type and an unwinding-deficient polymerase mutant will allow us to determine the inner workings of this molecular motor.",

From this single-organelle electrophoresis, we infer an effective charge smaller or of the order of 10 3 electrons, which corresponds to a surface-charge density significantly smaller than that of microtubules. By investigating the centrosome hydrodynamic behavior, we show that its charge has a remarkable influence over its own structure. Specifically, we find that the electric field which drains to the centrosome expands its structure to a physiological size a 60% larger than previous electron microscopy determinations, a self-effect which modulates its structural behavior via environmental pH. This methodology further proves useful to study the action of different environmental conditions, such as the presence of Ca 2+ , over the thermally-induced dynamic structure of the centrosome.",

Here he attachment of human rhino virus 2 (HRV2) to the cell surface, the first step in infection, was characterized. Sequential binding of multiple receptors was evident from recordings of characteristic quantized force spectra. This suggests that multiple receptors bound to the virus in a timely manner. Unbinding forces required to detach the virus from the cell membrane increased within a time frame of several 100 ms. The number of receptors involved in virus binding was determined and estimates for on-rate, off-rate, and equilibrium binding constant were obtained. Furthermore, we show that accurate free energy values of membrane protein unfolding can be obtained from single molecule force measurements. By applying a statistical theorem developed by Jarzynski, we derived equilibrium unfolding free energies of from unfolding force data acquired at different force loading-rates and temperatures. Finally, we present a method for the localization of specific binding sites and epitopes with nm positional accuracy. A magnetically driven AFM tip containing a ligand covalently bound via a tether molecule is oscillated at a few nm amplitude, during scanning along the surface. In this way, topography and recognition images on membranes and cell surfaces were obtained simultaneously. Mapping of the forces acting on biomolecules in cell membranes has spurred the development of effective labels, e.g. organic fluorophores and nanoparticles, to track trajectories of single biomolecules [1] . Standard methods use particular statistical observables, namely the mean square displacement (MSD), to extract cues on the underlying dynamics. Yet, MSD is not an appropriate tool to access force fields and becomes easily a biased estimator in the presence of positioning noise. Here, we introduce general inference methods [2] to fully exploit information hidden in the experimental trajectories, providing sharp estimates for the forces and the diffusion coefficients within membrane microdomains. Rapid and reliable convergence of the inference scheme is demonstrated on trajectories generated numerically. The inference method is then applied to infer forces and potentials acting on the receptor of the \u03b5-toxin labelled by lanthanide-ion nanoparticles. Results show a constant diffusivity inside a complex force field confining the receptor inside a specific domain. Our scheme is applicable to any labelled biomolecule, and results presented here show its general relevance to the issue of membrane compartmentation and protein motion. Large scale domain motions are structural rearrangements often adopted by enzymes to achieve their full functionality. Understanding the mechanism responsible for such movements by means of computational approaches is of great interest especially in rational drug design, since induced fit or population shift effects are closely related aspects of the problem. Unfortunately, the simulation time required to sample these events by conventional techniques such as plain molecular dynamics, is unfeasible. Here, the domain motion required by Adenosine kinase (AK) to achieve its (pre-)catalytic conformation was studied using well-tempered metadynamics [Barducci, A. et al. Phys Rev Lett. (2008) , 100: 020603] with path collective variables (PCVs) [Branduardi, D. et al. J Chem Phys. (2007) , 126: 054103]. First, a low energy path for the apo form of the enzyme was obtained, and the potential of mean force along the PCVs was reconstructed. Then, the large scale movement was simulated in the presence of two inhibitors known to bind to the enzyme in different conformational states. The adopted approach was proven to be successful both to understand the mechanistic features of the AK domain motion and to provide a picture of the population shift effects upon ligand binding.",

The apparatus permits us to probe the dynamics of the RNA structure with milisecond time-resolution. First, we pull the RNA and show that it mechanically unfolds in several reproducible steps. We use these results in combination with structure prediction tools to evaluate the possible structures of the RNA fragment in vitro. The most probable structure exhibits a unique binding site for L20. Then, force measurements are done on the RNA in presence of L20. We show that the protein specifically binds the RNA and stabilizes it. The binding site is recognized with a resolution of a few bases. Finally, two bases are mutated on the RNA fragment. In presence of these mutations, in vivo and in vitro binding of L20 to 23S RNA is abolished. The single molecule approach gives an explanation of this result: the force measurements show that the mutated RNA folds differently from the natural one and that it does not bind L20.",

Biological nanopores such as staphylococcal alpha-hemolysin (HL) have an added advantage over solid-state nanopores because they can be modified by genetic engineering with atomistic precision. Although we showed that all four DNA bases can be identified in an immobilized ssDNA molecule (1), the translocation of free DNA is too quick to observe single bases. Here we show that by a small increase of the net internal charge of the HL nanopore (e.g. by introducing a ring of 7 arginine residues), we have augmented the frequency of DNA translocation events through the pore and dramatically lowered the voltage threshold required for DNA translocation (2) . By further increasing the net positive charge of the transmembrane barrel region of the pore (e.g. by introducing 49 extra positive charges) we have also reduced the speed at which DNA translocate the pore by more than two orders of magnitude. These experiments provide a means of controlling DNA translocation with protein nanopores, which might be translated to solid-state nanopores by using chemical surface modification. The atomic force microscope (AFM) is a tool for imaging, measuring and manipulating matter at the nanoscale. Single-molecule pulling experiments give information on the thermodynamics and kinetics of biomolecules. The purpose if this work was to develop software to simulate single-molecule pulling experiments and to analyze singlemolecule pulling data. The long term objective is to asses the accuracy and precision of the parameters recovered from single-molecule pulling data.We carried out simulations for two different models [1, 2, 3] , using a wide range of loading rates. From the simulated force-extension curves we extracted the kinetic parameters and compared them with the values used for simulations. The kinetic parameters were the intrinsic rate coefficient (k 0 Kramers rate), the location of transition state (x ) and the free energy of activation (\u2206G). We have found that the loading rates have a small effect on the recovery of the free energy of activation, but have a significant effect on the recovery of the Kramers rate. We report the tracking of single myosin V molecules in their natural environment, the cell. Myosin V molecules, labeled with Quantum Dots, are introduced into the cytoplasm of living HeLa cells and their motion is recorded at the single molecule level with high spatial and temporal resolution. We perform intracellular measurements of key parameters of this molecular transporter: velocity, processivity, step size and dwell time. Our experiments bridge the gap between in vitro single molecule assays and the indirect measurements of the motor features deduced from the tracking of organelles in live cells.",

Neurotransmitter release probability (p) can be regulated by long-term plasticity (LTP and LTD at E synapses) and by GABA B and mGlu presynaptic receptors (both at E&I synapses). The p change in turn modifies shortterm plasticity, affecting the first response in a train much more than the followings. To gain insight into the role that p changes might have in computations performed at the cerebellum input stage, we have built detailed biophysical models of the E&I synapses. The model has allowed to investigate glomerular processing of high frequency inputs reaching the cerebellum. Optimal synaptic transmission through the MFs inputs resulted when GOs inhibited synchronously the GCs. The role of feed-forward inhibition onto synaptic transmission is under investigation.",

We study the unzipping process of the double stranded part of DNA both experimentally and theoretically. We show that in a first approximation the duplex opens progressively in a sequence dependent manner. The experimental results can be accounted for by modeling the unzipping process as a free diffusion of the unzipping fork in the energy landscape defined by the sequence of the basepaires.

The murine Polyomavirus is a non-enveloped DNA tumor virus with an icosahedral T=7d structure. Besides the knowledge of the structure, it is of utter importance to understand the process of viral assembly [1] . The assembly reaction of Polyoma VP1 does not show the typical sigmoidal kinetics in light scattering experiments. The apparent kinetics is of fourth order, which appears rather unrealistic. In order to gain knowledge on capsid composition during assembly beyond ensemble average, we apply methods of single molecule fluorescence, namely fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), fluorescence-intensity-distribution-analysis (FIDA), and single-particle-imaging (SPI). The molecular brightness and the diffusion time reported by FCS are in agreement with the results from light scattering. FIDA as well as SPI, moreover, point to a polymerization of subunits to complete capsids along the assembly pathway without pronounced intermediates. Mixing experiments show that already early in the course of the assembly reaction no exchange of pentamers between capsids occurs, and that the effect of Breathing [2] can be excluded for Polyoma VP1. Genetic information coded in DNA provides complete instructions to cells regarding metabolism and proper functioning. A number of endogenous and exogenous sources can damage the genomic DNA. Unrepaired DNA damage can give rise to mutations and may cause cell death. Cells have evolved different mechanisms to repair damaged DNA and to protect genetic integrity. Uracil in DNA occurs as a result of incorporation of dUMP in the place of dTMP during replication and deamination of cytocine, resulting in U:A and U:G base pairs, respectively. Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG) is a DNA repair protein that searches and removes uracil from DNA. UNG removes mismatched base by flipping it out from the base stack into the active site. The exact mechanism by which UNG searches DNA for uracil is unknown. Therefore, in our study we use Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to investigate the interaction between single UNG molecules with DNA carrying the U:A or U:G mismatches. Furthermore, we study the complexation of DNA and UNG protein. AFM images of UNG bound to DNA reveal the structural changes at the level of single complex, e.g. DNA kinking that may occur upon binding of UNG to DNA. Imaging of DNAprotein complexes can provide a a new level of understanding of UNG-DNA interaction. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) has been a useful device to visualize cellular and molecular structures at a single-molecule resolution. Especially, AFM imaging under the TREC T M (Topography and RECognition) mode (recognition imaging) can map a specific protein of interest within an AFM image. In this study, we employed an antibody-coupled AFM cantilever in recognition imaging, and dissected the structural/functional domains of \u03b1 Actinin-4, an actin binding protein that cross-bridges actin filaments and anchors it to Integrin via tailin-vinculin-\u03b1 actinin adaptor-interaction. A use of monoclonal anti-\u03b1 actinin-4 antibody enabled us to map its epitope in the amino-terminal actin-binding domain within a single molecule AFM image of \u03b1 Actinin-4.",

A method called photo-antibunching has successfully been used to determine the number of fluorescence emitters in multichromophoric systems. A statistical model to estimate the number of fluorescent molecules in a confocal observation volume is established based on photonantibunching in Time-Correlated Single-Photon Counting (TCSPC) scheme with 4 Avalanche Photon Diodes (APDs) for detection of individual photons. Numerical simulations based on realistic experimental conditions show that the model is able to estimate the number of molecules with moderate errors. Experiments on immobilized double-strand DNA oligonucleotides with photon stabilizing agents show promising results even when the number of molecules is \u223c 20. The proposed method allows us to monitor labelled single molecules and in the near future we plan to implement it in complex biological systems (cell extracts/live cells).",

Recent research shows that mutation of CNTN4 gene may be responsible for autism, while its absence in transgenic mice results in lack of smell sense. We use a homemade AFM single molecule puller and steered molecular dynamics simulation to test its elastic properties through force spectroscopy. Stretching experiments show unfolding of FnIII domains while IgC2 domains stay coiled as they are stabilized by disulfide bonds. Unfolding of Contactin-4 molecule appears to play role of buffer that helps to protect neural contacts from damage when neural cells are subjected to shock or tumor. Single molecule studies of the thermophilic Bacillus PS3 F 1 -ATPase have revealed kinetic and structural information that cannot be discerned using other methods, including the presence of 40 and 80 degree physical substeps (Yasuda et al. 2001 ) and the order and kinetics of chemical substeps. We are interested in using single molecule techniques to observe the effects of mgi mutations on enzyme kinetics and torque production in F 1 from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using a high speed imaging camera, we have captured the rotation of wild-type and mutant forms of yeast F 1 -ATPase. Rotation data for the wild-type and preliminary data for some mgi strains will be presented. We show for the first time that at saturating ATP, wild-type yeast F 1 rotates approximately four times faster than the thermophilic F 1 . Kinetic and substepping behaviour in yeast appears to be similar to that observed in bacterial F 1 .",

Ying 2 1 Molecular Medicine, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, SW7 2AZ, UK, 2 Chemical Biology Center, Imperial College London, SW7 2AZ, UK G-quadruplex is believed to be involved in many crucial biological processes, such as the gene regulation and the maintenance of human telomere. MEF2D, a member of MEF2 (myocyte enhancer factor-2) family of transcription factors, regulates the response of heart to cardiac stress signals. We found that a G-rich sequence starting at -145bp of MEF2D promoter can form a very stable intramolecular G-quadruplex. Here we present a detailed biophysical characterization of this quadruplex. We also found that this quadruplex is more stable than its duplex form under physiological conditions by CD melting and single molecular FRET. We observed subpopulations in smFRET measurements possibly due to different conformations of the quadruplex. We characterized its unfolding process by monitoring the change in FRET when it hybridizes to its C-rich complimentary strand. Finally, we proposed several possible structures of this quadruplex based on the smFRET and fluorescence DMS footprinting results. This research is supported by National Heart and Lung Institute Foundation. By stretching a polymer in solution using single molecule techniques it is possible to infer about its physical properties. AFM stretching experiments allow for a full characterization of the elasto-mechanical properties of the sample under study. In the presented work, single molecule AFM force spectroscopy experiments were used to determine mechanical properties of a peptide obtained from Exon 28 (Ex28) of the human elastin gene. Elastin is a protein with important mechanical properties and, in particular, it shows quasi ideal elastic behavior associated to the presence of many hydrophobic unstructured domains (such as Ex28) into the protein structure. Ex28 coded polymer was used as a starting point to obtain bio-materials with specialized elastomechanical functions. In particular, a mutated polypeptide based on the EX28 sequence was synthesisized with the aim of obtaining a new polymer with the same mechanical and physical properties of the native molecule but with increased aggregation properties, induced by a cross-linking reaction. AFM stretching experiments were used to verify the mechanical properties of the engineered proteins at a single molecule level. The obtained results allowed not only to address this question, but also to give some insight into the first aggregation steps of the polymer towards the formation of reticulated structures. Luminescent lanthanide-ion doped nanoparticles (NPs) are attractive single-biomolecule labels. They are synthesized directly in water, are highly photostable, and display narrow emission without intermittency. We coupled Y 0.6 Eu 0.4 VO 4 NPs to \u03b5-toxins produced by Clostridium perfringens, which bind to a specific receptor on MDCK cells. Single-molecule tracking experiments using these labels produce long (5 min) uninterrupted trajectories with temporal resolution down to 20 ms or localization precision down to 15 nm. We found that the toxin receptor exhibits confined motion in cell membrane microdomains. To analyze the receptor trajectories, we used a novel approach based on an inference method [1] . This method fully exploits the information of the ensemble of the trajectory, in contrast to the usual mean square displacement analysis. Applying both techniques to recorded trajectories, we highlight the difference in extracted parameters. From the shape of the confining potential, obtained by mapping the forces inside the domain, we can deduce information about the mechanism of confinement. In combination with experiments on cholesterol depletion and cytoskeleton destruction, this technique will shed light into the nature of the membrane micropatterning. Background: Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are save-life device for patients at risk of sudden cardiac death, and help cardiac patients to avoid slow beat-rate by means of anti-bradichardia pacing (ABP) feature. However, recent literature evidenced the presence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTs) immediately following ABP, leading to the hypothesis that ICD devices might be pro-arrhythmic. Aim: Study differences between pacing-associated tachyarrhythmias (PAT) and other spontaneous VTs. Signals and methods: 165 spontaneous VT episodes are retrieved from 37 patients with ICD. VTs are examined and PAT episodes, classified. Characterization of VTs is based on the analysis of 20 seconds immediately preceding VT-onset quantified by: heart cycle (HC-PreVT), prevalence of premature ventricular contraction (PVCprev) and prevalence of paced beats (Pprev). Significant differences are evaluated by Student-T or Chi-square tests with p<0.05. Results: 20 VT episodes from 8 patients are PAT episodes (12%). Cardiac activity preceding PATs vs. non-PATs differs: PAT episodes have higher HC-PreVT (p<0.01), greater Pprev (p<0.001), and greater PVCprev (p<0.001). Analysis also shows that PAT episode often occur when the paced beat immediately follows a premature contraction. Conclusion: The study indicates that new ICD generations should avoid ABP after premature ventricular contraction.",

Thus a logic and useful development is to combine technologies for simultaneous measurements on a single sensor surface. To develop a biosensor platform such as an assay fast and accurately, mechanistical understanding of why the platform works is essential. Quartz Crystal Microbalance-with Dissipation (QCM-D) technology and instrumentation provides an open platform and enable easy and precise quantification of mass, thickness and viscoelastic properties of surface bound molecules. These parameters provide both a reference tool in assay development, but also detecting and identifying your target molecules as the combination of mass and material property info in many cases provide a unique response for a specific molecule. By combining QCM-D with other technologies, a range of useful info is put within easy reach of the researcher. Recent advances will be presented where simultaneous real time and in situ measurements using QCM-D together with electrochemistry, ellipsometry and fluorescence microscopy enables manipulation of films as well as quantification of the variation of water content as a result of conformational changes in immobilized molecules.

Shaptadvipa 2 1 Assam Agricultural University, Jorhat-785013, India, 2 International Institute of Intrinsic Gravitation Biology (i3GB), Jorhat-785013, India 'Self gravitation bio' is an emerging concept in biophysics. Intrinsic or 'self' gravitational force might exert when mass increases beyond critical level in biological particle pyramid. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics of intrinsic gravity) 'Metabolically inert infrastructure' (MII) consists of total body mass (body water, dissolved substances, mineral and organic deposits) and serves as storage of nutrients, transport and distribution of these materials. To act independently as living body, MII is suggested also to provide structural support to the organism with density-gradient buoyant force against intrinsic and extrinsic gravitational attraction for the biological mass. It is shown that 'amniotic fluid', 'isotonic saline to ailing patient', 'growth factors', 'cultural medium' and other 'medium matrices' act as counter-gravity mechanism for micro to macro living organisms under center-of-biomass reference frame. Controversy over relationship between BMR (basal metabolic rate), RMR (resting metabolic rate), PAL (physical activity level), on one hand, and mass of the living organism, on the other, (as described in Rubner's 2/3 law, Kleiber's 3/4 law that continued to be contested by many) can be favorably resolved substituting the concept of self gravitation bio, considering 'mass' as synonym of gravitational force under center-of-biomass reference frame. Bioenergetics would be an unequal but opposite entity of self-gravity reinforced by extrinsic gravity. Platelet arrest on von Willebrand factor (VWF) occurs transiently via the platelet receptor GPIb. Depending on the combination of shear stress and surface density of VWF binding sites the platelets either only adhere, pull tethers or generate microparticles. These processes are influenced by the properties of the platelet membrane and the cytoskeleton. Under shear flow conditions these platelet characteristics were examined with reflection interference contrast microscopy and a viscosimeter. In addition we quantified platelet adhesion energy and tether pulling forces. Disrupting platelet F-actin had several effects. The tethers were shorter, the membrane contact area was larger, the receptor \u03b1IIb\u03b23 density of the microparticles was depleted and no platelet spreading occurred. Breaking up the microtubular system had different implications. The number of severed tethers tripled, the contact area was smaller, microparticle formation was increased and the area of spread platelets was reduced. However changes in the membrane elasticity had no effect on the platelets. Our results suggest that platelet attachment and adhesion is not only determined by the platelet adhesion receptors and their cytoplasmic linker proteins, but that cytoskeletal structures have also a crucial influence on how platelets interact with thrombogenic surfaces. Gene expression is orchestrated by a host of regulatory proteins that coordinate the transcription of DNA to RNA. Regulatory proteins function by locating specific binding sequences of DNA and binding to these sequences to form the transcription initiation complex. In many instances, these regulatory proteins only have several hundred copies that must efficiently locate target sequences on the genome-length DNA strand. The non-specific binding of regulatory proteins to random sequences of DNA is believed to permit the protein to slide along the DNA in a stochastic manner. Periodically, a thermal kick or an interaction with another bound protein will disengage the regulatory protein from the DNA surface, leading to three-dimensional diffusion. Eventually, the protein will reattach to the DNA at some new location that is dictated by both the diffusivity of the protein and the DNA configuration. Cycling through these random events constitutes a search strategy for the target site. We build a reaction-diffusion theory of this search process in order to predict the optimal strategy for target site localization. The statistical behavior of the DNA strand acts as a necessary input into the theory, and we consider several governing behaviors for the DNA strand. We explore the impact of DNA configuration and protein occlusion on target site localization in order to predict how protein expression will vary under different experimental conditions.",

Wanderlingh 1 1 Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Messina University, Italy, 2 Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Perugia University, Italy Important functions of biological processes require large atomic rearrangements and conformational fluctuations. For proteins, atoms are mostly displaced along the soft directions identified by the delocalized, low frequency vibrations. The study of very low energy vibrational spectrum of proteins is therefore of particular interest. As a step toward understanding their functional role, we have investigated the low frequency vibrational motions (0.03\u00f710 meV) in different proteins by performing inelastic neutron scattering and low temperature (1.5\u00f730 K) specific heat measurements. For the first time for biological systems, the well-known Boson peak found in neutron scattering spectra at \u223c 3 meV is put in relationship with a clear anomaly of the measured specific heat located at around 7 K. This departure from the Debye-like behavior further expands the analogy of proteins with glassy systems. Quite interestingly, in the very low sub-meV energy range and below \u223c3K, we observe an additional anomalous behaviour, which could be ascribed to the existence of twolevel-systems states. Increasing the hydration degree, the low energy vibrational region is drastically altered, revealing that the addition or removal of the hydrogen bond network around the protein deeply modifies the interatomic forces, affecting the character of the vibrational modes.",

Confocal microscopy of fibrin gels shows a collection of straight fibers, not uniformly distributed in space, connected together at low-order (3) (4) branching points. Although each fiber is quite straight (mass fractal dimension D m =1), for the overall system D m >1. Based on the confocal images, we generated threedimensional (3D) synthetic gels made of cylindrical sticks of diameter d, joined together at randomly distributed nodal points. The resulting 3D network is no more random but ordered on length scales of the order the average fiber length, and exhibits a fractal morphology with D m \u223c1. 2-1.7 . The gel structure is analyzed by means of its 3D correlation function g 3D (r)=<n(x) n(x+r)> x , where n(x) is the gel local density. Since the gel is isotropic, g 3D depends on the modulus r=|r| and can be obtained by averaging 2D correlation functions evaluated at different heights of the gel volume. From this analysis we recover the fiber diameter d (FWHM of g 3D ), the fractal dimension D m (power-law decay of g 3D ) and the gel mesh-size \u03be (minimum in g 3D ). Furthermore, the 3D-Fourier transform of g 3D (r) gives the gel power spectrum I(q), which compares quite well with elastic light and multi-wavelength turbidimetry data taken on real gels.",

In this model, DNA is represented by a pair of harmonic chains coupled by a nonlinear potential. The most frequently used nonlinear potential for this purpose is the Morse potential. Some extensions of the original model are proposed considering, for example, the helicoidal structure of DNA. An important objective for this kind of model is to understand the phenomenon of thermal denaturation and, through this, get some knowledge about other processes such as the genetic transcription and drug intercalation. It is possible to obtain from this type of model interesting properties, such as the average stretching between base pairs as a function of the temperature using the transfer integral operator. Dynamical properties of this model were also explored and several phenomenological quantities are studied, such as energy localization. In this work, we extend the original PB model by introducing rotational motions for the nucleotides. In this way, both the vibrational and rotational motion for each nucleotide are considered. The stretch of the base pairs is given by the Morse potential in the same way as in the original PB model. However, the coupling between the two kinds of motion, rotation and vibration, is obtained through a nonlinear combination of them in the Morse potential.",

By applying constraints as a diffusional limit for kinetic constants, constant free energy differences between enzymatic states and constant thermodynamic force, we calculated Shannon information entropy and entropy production of the entire reaction system as a function of forward rate constants. We found maxima in the net steady-state metabolic flux, total entropy production and Shannon entropy for equal values of forward rate constants.

In conclusion, we demonstrated that MEPP is an appropriate selection principle for evolutionary optimization of enzymes. Attractive interaction between like-charged lipid surfaces mediated by spherical nanoparticles with spatially distributed charge is theoretically described by using functional density theory and MC simulations. The spatial distribution of charge within a single nanoparticle is considered by two effective charges at a finite distance. The minimization of the free energy is performed to obtain the equilibrium configuration of the system. Both, the rigorous solution of the variational problem and the MC simulations show that orientational ordering of nanoparticles subject to the gradient of the electric field gives rise to an attractive interaction between charged lipid surfaces for high enough charge densities of the interacting surfaces and large enough separations between charges within the nanoparticle. The attraction is explained by orientational ordering of dimeric charges in the electric field which lowers free energy. Viral genomes encode for a series of membrane proteins which are embedded or attached to the lipid membrane of the host, or penetrate them during the very first step of viral invasion. We are focussing especially to those of the former which are known to assemble and from channels or pores for small ions or substrates. With these channel forming proteins the virus manipulates the host cell interior for the benefit of its replication. Strategies are developed to answer the question about the assembly process of these proteins based on the 'two stage model' and the substrate flux. Only few experimental data are available to answer these questions, consequently we stress computational methods to derive the adequate answers. The methods applied are ab inito molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) and conventional MD simulations. Potential routes for assembly of the three transmembrane domains of 3a protein from SARS-CoV will be outlined and compared with computational data from other viral membrane proteins. With a novel pore lining motif suggested for 3a, the dynamics of ions at selected positions within the putative pore will be assessed.",

To study the process of antibiotics translocation at a molecular scale, we performed molecular dynamic simulations accelerated with the metadynamics algorithm. We studied the diffusion of antibiotics with different structural and chemical properties through OmpF wild-type and variants. The free energy surface suggests faster translocation for the cephalosporins compared to the penicillins antibiotics, and also for OmpF mutants compared to the wild type. Further, the conservation of favored orientation and affinity sites of antibiotics inside the OmpF channel reveal which specific interactions govern translocation. The calculated energy barriers and rate determining interactions for translocations compared well with the electrophysiology measurements and liposome swelling assays from our collaborators. This study demonstrates how theory and experiments can be combined to reveal the structural determinants and mechanism of OmpF permeation.

Bechhoefer Dept. of Physics, Simon Fraser Univ., Burnaby, BC, Canada DNA replication requires two distinct processes: the initiation of pre-licensed replication origins and the propagation of replication forks away from the fired origins. Experiments indicate that these origins are triggered over the whole genome at a rate I(t) (the number of initiations per unreplicated length per time) that increases throughout most of the synthesis (S) phase, before rapidly decreasing to zero at the end of the replication process. We propose a simple model for the control of DNA replication in which the rate of initiation of replication origins is controlled by the interaction with a population of ratelimiting proteins. We find the time set by reaction-diffusion kinetics for such proteins to find, bind to, and trigger a potential origin. The replication itself is modeled using a formalism resembling that used to study the kinetics of first-order phase transitions. Analyzing data from Xenopus frog embryos, we find that the initiation rate is reaction limited until nearly the end of replication, when it becomes diffusion limited. Initiation of origins and hence I(t) is suppressed when the diffusionlimited search time dominates. We find that, in order to fit the experimental data, the interaction between DNA and the rate-limiting protein must be subdiffusive. We also find that using a constant nuclear import of the limiting proteins leads to a more accurate description of the experimental data.",

The second part consists in the elimination from the connectivity graph of the relationships that have a non-null correlation coefficient, but that are not biochemically plausible. The cutting of false correlations from the graph is performed through the estimation of the parameters (\"calibration\") of the network. To calibrate the network for detecting null dynamics correlations, we developed the software tool KInfer (Knowledge Inference). Based on a new probabilistic model of the variations in reaction concentrations, KInfer infers the values of the kinetic rate constants, their confidence regions and the level of noise in the input data by maximizing the likelihood to obtain the observed variations given the network model. The a priori knowledge required as input is minimal, as it consists only in the time-series of reactant concentrations. The minimal a priori knowledge and the probabilistic formulation of the calibration method make the accuracy of the predictions strong against experimental, biological and stochastic noise, and allows to use it to cut the null-dynamics edges of the connectivity graph.",

For example, pairwise RMSD (pRMSD) is used to assess similarity of the lowest energy NMR structures or for clustering large ensembles of structures. On the other hand, to obtain information on the local structure of a macromolecule and its dynamics, root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) is often used. RMSF can be calculated from MD simulations, but also from experimental X-ray B-factors. Since pRMSD and RMSF report on different features, it is interesting to ask what the relationship between them is. First, we provide a mathematical derivation showing that, given a set of conservative assumptions, the <pRMSD> RMS is directly related to the <RMSF> RMS and, consequently, experimental B-factors. Second, we demonstrate this on structures taken from distributed-computing MD simulations of the native and unfolded state of villin headpiece.

Charge migration along DNA helices may be biologically important because extended electronic states could play a role in the processes of sensing of DNA damage and/or DNA repair via long-range charge transfer. We measured conductivity and other physical characteristics of several models of natural and diversely damaged molecules of DNA. DNA polymers were mimicked by various sequences of 32nucleotide-long double helices with fully Watson-Crick (WC) paired bases, with several central bases mismatched, and also with chemical modifications that included removal of bases from a few central nucleotides (abasic DNA), and neutralization of phosphate charges by their derivatization. The model DNAs were investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy, time-resolved THz spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, circular dichroism, and modeled by molecular dynamics simulations. DNA has the highest conductivity in its biologically most relevant double helical form with WC base pairs and negatively charged phosphates equilibrated with counterions. Mismatches and all chemical modifications always lower the conductivity. The mechanism of charge transfer is consistent with electron or hole hopping between parallel stacked bases. These observations and data showing that the natural DNA has also the most regular double helical form suggest that the continuous base stacking is critical for charge transfer. To control the passage across the bacterial cell wall nature created a large number of \"nano\"-channels which may act as selective gates for water soluble molecules. Here we focus on porins from E. coli which control permeation through interactions with the channel surface. Comparing single channel temperature dependent conductance measurements with all atom modeling allow conclusions on the mode of permeation. For example, surprisingly modeling OmpF-conductance revealed not only a good agreement with the experiment over a broad range of temperature but also the selectivity for ions. The primary task of porins is to provide facilitated diffusion. We investigated facilitated diffusion of maltooligosaccharide or antibiotics. Time resolved conductance measurements allows conclusion on the flux and molecular modeling identifies the limiting interactions with the surface, reveal potential barriers and pathways. Exploiting the selectivity of natural or bioengineered channels has promising applications for detecting molecules, characterizing molecular interaction, sequencing DNA, protein folding etc. Traditionally, studies of diffusion-controlled reaction of biological macromolecules have been made in diluted solutions. However, the high concentration of macromolecules in intracellular environments results into non-specific interactions (macromolecular crowding), which have a great importance on the kinetics and thermodynamics of possible reactions that occur in these systems. In the literature there are studies concerning Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, giving results that are satisfactory agreement with experimental data, showing, for example, that the protein diffusion in cell cytoplasm is reduced considerably. In addition, there are MC studies about enzymatic reaction, which predict a temporal dependency of the velocity constant in macromolecular crowding. In this work, we try to compare the predicted behavior by MC simulation with the results obtained from the study of the diffusion and reaction of a model protein (alpha-chymotrypsin) using spectroscopic techniques in highly confined media in order to study experimentally the temporal dependence of its diffusion and reaction coefficients.",

The protein under investigation was the Maltose Binding Protein (MBP), which is a well-known and widely studied model of biosensor systems. We found that the low-temperature single particle dynamics of MBP hydration water shows clear features that can be traced back to amorphous systems. More in detail, its vibrational density of states is simply described as the superposition of the contributions of low-density and high-density amorphous ice. The quasielastic signal, which appears at the higher temperatures, can be excellently described with a fractional power law which may put in relationship with the peculiarities of fractal systems. Quite strikingly, there is a strong similarity, on both the qualitative and quantitative point of view, with the behaviour of hydrated proteins. The collective dynamics of protein hydration water is characterised by the presence of two modes, whose dispersion curves are reminiscent of those of bulk water. However, the relevant damping factors suggest a strong similarity with glassy systems.",

Upon incorporation of the RC into a progressively dehydrated trehalose matrix the electron transfer between the primary photoreduced quinone and the photoxidized donor accelerates progressively and becomes broadly distributed. This behaviour reflects the hindrance of protein relaxation following charge separation and the inhibition of interconversion between conformational substates. In extensively dehydrated matrices the recombination kinetics is two-times faster and three-times more distributed in the wt RC, indicating a larger inhibition of the internal protein dynamics. In line with this findings Brownian dynamics simulations reveal a larger rigidity of the carotenoid-containing structure, in which a cluster of residues close to the quinone acceptors is stiffened as compared to the R26 RC. The in silico and experimental results indicate that the introduction of an internal void in the RC structure has long-range effects on the protein dynamics and that the coupling between the glassy matrix and the RC interior depends markedly on the local mechanical properties of the protein.",

Tolic-Norrelykke 1 1 MPI-CBG, Dresden, Germany, 2 MPI-PKS, Dresden, Germany In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the nucleus is positioned at the cell center. Since the nucleus determines the cell division site, keeping the nucleus at the center is crucial for ensuring symmetrical cell division (1 ) . Microtubules push against the cell ends and exert force on the nucleus (2 ), but how the cell regulates these forces in order to center the nucleus remains unknown. Here we tackle this problem by using a combination of live cell imaging, cell manipulations by optical tweezers, and a theoretical model. We show that microtubule pushing forces can center the nucleus because of a larger number of contacts between the microtubules and the proximal cell end than the distal one. Moreover, kinesin-8 motors (Klp5/6) increase the rate of microtubule catastrophe (transition from growth to shrinkage) in a microtubule length-and contact-dependent manner. Thus, the motor behavior results in a longer contact between a microtubule and the proximal than the distal cell end. Taken together, our experimental and theoretical results provide a novel centering mechanism, where kinesin-8 motors increase the efficiency of nuclear centering. Electropermeabilization is a commonly used physical method which can induce a transient permeabilization of the cell membrane allowing the entry of therapeutic molecules into the cell and is thus of great interest in the fields of cancer treatment and gene therapy [1] . However, very little is known about the mechanisms occurring at molecular level. There is clearly some microscopic reorganization of the membrane which is responsible for this change in its transverse transport properties. Rather than studying the change of these transport properties, we adopt a simple strategy based on the use of giant unilamellar vesicles and videomicroscopy, as described below. We apply a series of permeabilizing electric pulses to the liposomes, and we observe a size decrease down to a critical radius beyond which their size no longer changes. This decrease in size points to the fact that during the physical processes leading to electropermeabilization, lipids are lost from the vesicles. Our results published in [2] suggest different possible modes for lipid loss, which can be small vesicles, pores, or tubules formation. ",

Diabetes has been implicated as a risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease. Some diabetes drugs appear to decrease the cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease. It has been recently demonstrated that extracellular injection of insulin is able to protect neurons against A-beta amyloid cell death. One of the proposed theories to explain such an effect is that the hematic glucose levels affect the metabolism of the hippocampus, a part of the brain (associated with memory, emotion and motor skills), which is strongly damaged in Alzheimer's patients. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of insulin on the A-beta induced degeneration and oxidative stress on the neuroblastoma LAN5 cell line. In particular, the present study looks into the role of insulin in the inhibition of Abeta specific degenerative apoptotic pathways. Preliminary results indicate that insulin dissolved in culture medium in its hexameric form (as tested by absolute scale light scattering) is able to reduce neurodegeneration induced by A-beta amyloid in a dose dependent manner. The link between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease may provide new targets for future Alzheimer's treatments. Moreover, due to the increased incidence of diabetes in western countries, a deeper understanding of such a link is relevant in order to control the escalation in the number of people dealing with dementia.",

[ The key role of water in living systems has been widely studied in Literature, along with its anomalies, consequence of the extensive three-dimensional hydrogen bonding of water molecules. Moreover protein-water interactions take place at protein surface where cell water has been recognized to behave differently from bulky water. The two-states theory of water assumes that water is a mixture of microdomains of different structure and density, the low-density water (LDW) and the high-density water (HDW) domains, and ions partition selectively into LDW or HDW domains. The idea developed in this work was to explore the ordered water structure by measuring Delayed Luminescence (DL) from salt aqueous solutions in which water structuring is anticipated. It appeared that DL signal from salt solutions is significantly relevant when prevalence of LDW domains is foreseen, with a decay time probability distribution function characterized by a broad maximum in the microsecond range. The obtained results support the ability of DL to reveal the different properties of LDW and HDW domains induced by salt molecules. Moreover, the results reveal the existence of clusters, whose characteristics strongly depend on the specific ion effects, of surprisingly long lifetimes not observed till now.

[1, 2] The CD spectroscopic analyses of the peptide-lipid complexes revealed the structural preservation and elucidated the importance of a zwitterionic interaction of the peptide termini. [3] The peptide design was enhanced regarding the versatile functionalization with analytical probes as well as molecular recognition moieties like peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) to observe the effects of aggregation and specific organization within model lipid membranes even at high peptide-to-lipid ratios. [3] X-ray reflectivity on lipid bilayer stacks in combination with heavy atom labeling and spectroscopic studies of vesicle systems provides information about the peptide structure and interaction in the native fluid state of the membrane system. [2, 3] For this, the Fmoc-diiodo-allylglycine building block was created to serve as a novel iodine label pinpointing at a certain position with respect to the membrane normal. We study thermal undulations of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) of lipids by flickering spectroscopy. Getting values for the mechanical parameters of lipid bilayers requires the experimental fluctuation spectra to be scrutinized in view of the classical Helfrich's theory. Pure bending modes are revealed unable in predicting the large fluctuations systematically found at high wavevectors. Hybrid curvature-dilational modes have been invoked as a more efficient mode of motion in producing high curvatures. A bimodal spectrum of the thermal undulations has been theoretically developed for the shell-like topology. From this new description, two important consequences emerge a priori, the dependence of the fluctuation dynamics on either vesicle size and on bending/compression parameters. For POPC and DOPC vesicles containing cholesterol the experimental fluctuation spectra are well described by the new spectrum. Reconciliation between experiments and theory is achieved when this bimodal spectrum is considered. The new theory opens enormous possibilities for better exploring membrane mechanics in GUV models. Under normal conditions, platelets circulate in the vascular system having very low interaction with each other and with other cells. The platelets become activated when the biological system is disturbed, for instance by vascular damage in which blood gets in contact with collagen. Upon activation, different types of receptors/molecules are exposed on the cell membrane to support adhesion, spreading and aggregation of the platelets onto the damaged vessel. The measurement of altered platelet function is particularly important in cardiovascular diseases such as thrombosis. We are investigating biosensor technologies for the detection of functional properties of platelets. An important study is the specific and non-specific stimulation of platelets in a biosensor cartridge. We will present experimental results on biosensor platelet activation using the platelet-specific membrane markers P-selectin and GP1b.",

Free walking was videotaped from the landing day. Although preliminary analysis of walking showed differences in both hindlimb and forelimb joint angles and a hyperextension of the hindlimbs was apparent, the numerical values reached the significance level only for the ankle angle measured at specific moments of the step cycle: foot contact, maximum loading with weight, foot lift and maximum flexion during swing. We report here on the behavior of all the joints during the whole step cycle, by computing the integral of these angles over the step cycle. The results were affected by the differences in the walking speed (the young animals walked faster than the controls), so we scaled the integrals by the step cycle duration. We found that, besides the ankle, the knee was also more extended throughout the whole step cycle in both groups of animals. Moreover, all the joints (including the toe and the hip) were affected in the same way (hyperextended), since the differences were still significant when we added together these angles. The animals recovered slowly, with significant differences remaining after 14 days of readaptation.",

Blood was obtained from healthy donors and measurements were performed at initial hematocrit 40%. The intensity of scattered light was measured during sedimentation of RBCs suspended in saline -Dextran 70 solutions at different polymer concentrations (2 -6 g/dl). The changes in the intensity of the scattered light manifest RBC aggregate formation, their sedimentation and the process of deposit formation. The deposit formation curve was determined. It is shown that the concentration of dextran affects the deposit formation. An empirical model has been used to describe the experimental data. The parameters of the deposit formation curve as a function of dextran concentration are analyzed. Water is essential to life and a major scientific interest lies in a detailed understanding of how it interacts with biological macromolecules in cells. We studied water dynamics in whole cells with neutron scattering [1, 2, 3] . The cellular environment is extremely crowded with macromolecules and water molecules are permanently in close contact to biological interfaces. We measured water dynamics in E. coli and human Red Blood Cells with neutron scattering [2, 3] . The data revealed two populations of water in the cells: a major fraction which has dynamical properties similar to those of bulk water (relaxation times \u223cps) and a minor fraction in the order of \u223c10% which is interpreted as bound hydration water with significantly slower dynamics (relaxation times >49 ps). In this contribution we report on investigation of model membrane dynamics by means of Quasi Elastic and Inelastic Incoherent Neutron scattering and on the effect of membrane inserted pore forming peptide Gramicidin. Model membrane are realized by highly oriented, hydrated phospholipid bilayer stacks of DMPC (1,2-dimyristoyl-snglycero-3-phoshatidylcholine) hydrated with D2O in excess of solvent condition. The bilayer were supported on mica substrates and prepared at different concentrations of Gramicidin, a 15-residue oligopeptide showing antimicrobial activity by forming pores on the membrane surfaces which allow water and small ions to permeate across the membrane. Incoherent QENS and INS spectra, measured on IN5 and IN13 spectrometer at ILL, allows to obtaining information on the mean dynamics of the Hydrogen atoms in the system. Moreover, by proper orientations of the membrane plane respect to the scattering wave vector Q, we were able to derive information on in plane and out of plane motions of the phospholipids.",

Cell adhesion and motility are processes involved in fundamental biological phenomena. They imply multimolecular scaffolds as anchorage points and actin cytoskeleton filaments to build internal stress and eventually crawl onto the substrate. These processes, very dynamic by nature are out of equilibrium. We study cell adhesion on micro-patterned substrates where the introduction of a finite distance between the possible anchorage points of the cell modifies drastically the organization of the cytoskeleton and the anchorage point's distribution. Because statistical quantification shows that some shapes are more likely than other, we believe they represent particular organizations of the system which should minimize the energy dissipation. We checked this hypothesis by using the Cellular Potts Model. Shapes obtained by simulation are in excellent qualitative agreement with experimental shapes. They depend on phenomenological parameters such as interaction between cells and the extra cellular matrix, a line tension and an elastic modulus. The aim of this work is to link model parameters to physico-chemical properties of cells and to establish phenomenological relations between relevant biochemical regulators controlling the cytoskeleton organization.",

Recent works have addressed the potential of nanoparticles to affect amyloid aggregation. The experimental data are very controversial suggesting that particle characteristics markedly influence the final effect of nanoparticles on the amyloid aggregation (initiation, acceleration or inhibition of amyloid aggregation). We investigate the ability of electrostatically stabilized magnetic nanoparticles of Fe 3 O 4 to affect the amyloid aggregation of lysozyme, as a prototype amyloidogenic protein. We have used a combination of spectroscopic (ThT fluorescence) and local microscopic techniques (AFM). We found, that the ability of magnetic nanoparticles to inhibit formation of amyloid aggregates or destroy pre-formed amyloids exhibit concentrationdependence. The values of inhibition IC50 and depolymerization DC50 were determined suggesting that nanoparticles interfere with lysozyme aggregation at stoichiometric concentrations.

Dixon Department of Chemistry, University of Warwick, UK Due to the immense medical importance of proteins which span the membrane of cells, detailed molecular structural information of these systems is essential. Practical difficulties in employing high-resolution structural elucidation techniques have resulted in a relative paucity of fully resolved membrane protein structures. Therefore a variety of lower-resolution techniques are used to determine structural information of the transmembrane (TM) domains of proteins. One example of such a membrane protein is ErbB-2, a receptor tyrosine kinase responsible for triggering cell division and which is prone to a mutation in its transmembrane domain resulting in permanent activation and oncogenic effects. We have predicted an interface for the mutated TM domain dimer using site-specific infrared spectroscopy containing a repeating sequence of Ile, Val and Leu 1 . Applying the in vivo TOXCAT assay to the TM domain sequence and to specific mutants of it, confirms this proposed interface whilst another proposed interface is discounted. Current studies are focussing on the effect of the TM mutation to the activation of the ErbB-2 receptor and to any possible change in this interface. Bacteriophages are complex molecular assemblies which multiplication relies on bacteria infection. The process starts with the binding of the phage on its specific host receptor and the injection of its genome into the host cytoplasm. Our work aims to determine the physical mechanisms and forces driving the DNA transfer from the phage capsid. The in vitro DNA ejection has been analyzed by using light scattering and gel electrophoresis measurements for three phages (T5, SPP1 and Lambda) belonging to the same family (Syphoviridae). Our results reveal two forces contributing to drive the DNA transfer: the first one is originated from the pressurization due to the strong confinement of DNA into the capsid; the second one comes from a pulling mechanism originated by the presence of condensed DNA outside the capsid. These two contributions were characterized in in vitro conditions but they likely play a role in the in vivo transfer. The ejection kinetics was also analysed and the characteristic time of the mechanism was studied as a function of the temperature. It appears to follow an Arrhenius law, allowing the determination of the activation energy that governs the transfer. The energy values are close for the different phages, suggesting that the mechanism regulating the ejection is common for a given phage family. Below these general features, our studies also reveal differences between the three phages.",

To clarify its mechanism of action it is crucial to elucidate the interaction of A\u03b2 with the neural membrane. In previous work we demonstrated the capability of A\u03b2 to penetrate and perturb stacked lipid bilayers. In this study we considered polymer cushioned lipid bilayers as a model for neural membranes. The polymer cushion is aimed to preserve the membrane natural fluidity; it is obtained depositing charged polyelectrolites layer-by-layer; the lipid membrane is built on the top of the polymer film by fusion of unilamellar vesicles. The floating membranes were kept always in contact to the subphase. The kinetics of adsorption of the lipid double layer at the polymer/water interface was monitored by neutron reflectivity; different experimental conditions to obtain the best surface coverage were exploited. After administration of A\u03b2 to the subphase the lipid membrane still adhered to the polymer cushion, but its structure was modified by the interaction with A\u03b2. Neutron reflectivity showed a change of the scattering density profile in the direction perpendicular to the membrane plane, suggesting a penetration of A\u03b2 inside the double layer. A change in the surface morphology was detected by AFM imaging; AFM film-rupture experiments showed that A\u03b2 weakens the lipid packing.",

The Z ring also recruits other proteins (e.g. ZapA, YgfE, ZipA) to the division site, where they participate in formation of the septum that separates the two daughter cells. We have studied FtsZ polymerization and its dynamic behaviour in real time by right angle light scattering. Similar to tubulin, FtsZ polymerizes into dynamic protofilaments in the presence of GTP; polymer assembly is accompanied by GTP hydrolysis. The kinetics of inorganic phosphate (P i ) released from the GTP hydrolysis have been studied as well, employing a fast and sensitive colourimetric assay. At pH 6.5, approximate 90% of the P i was released into the media within 20 minutes of GTP addition. The effects of GTP, pH, K + , and Mg 2+ were studied in both cases, and the results were used to build up a model for the mechanism of fibre assembly and disassembly. YgfE, a FtsZ accessory protein, is identified as a functional ZapA orthologue. Finally, we have studied the YgfE bundling to FtsZ polymers. It strongly promotes FtsZ bundling and is an inhibitor of the GTPase activity. Many genomes of viruses encode small membrane spanning proteins which are proposed to modify membrane permeability for ions and small molecules. These channel or pore forming proteins are getting into the focus for antiviral therapy since they are essential for some of the viruses. One of the general themes of the mechanism of function of the proteins is to self-assemble to form the functional form. We present a study on the open reading frame (ORF) 8a membrane protein encoded in structural region of Human Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoVs). The full length ORF8a protein is 39 residues long and contains a single transmembrane (TM) domain. Full length protein is synthesized using solid phase peptide synthesis and reconstituted into artificial lipid bilayers forms cation-selective ion channels. The bilayer recordings show cation selection channel activity with a major conductance level of around 8.5 pS also at elevated temperatures (38.5 \u2022 C). In silico studies with a 22 amino acid TM domain are done to assess conformational space of the monomeric ORF8a helix. With this monomeric helix homooligomeric helical bundle models are built and embedded in a fully hydrated 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol-3phosphatidylcholine (POPC) bilayer. Results of both experimental channel recordings and computational modeling show SARS ORF8a to act as a channel forming protein.",

Their rigid structure can resist high forces while their intrinsic ability to switch stochastically between growth and shrinkage phases allows them dynamically to reorganise. In cells, a sizeable network of microtubule binding proteins control and regulate microtubule dynamics. Alp14 and Dis1 are members of the Dis1/ XMAP215 family that are major players in S.pombe. The deletion phenotypes of Alp14 and Dis1 are similar, but nonetheless distinct. Both are involved in the formation of spindles but Alp14 is also involved in the maintenance of cytosolic microtubules in interphase. The restrictive temperatures of Alp14-deletion and Dis1-deletion mutants are different. Alp14 interacts with Alp7, a potential member of the TACC protein family. I am working to reconstitute Alp14/Dis1-dependent microtubule dynamics in vitro, using purified S. pombe tubulin. Both Alp14 and Dis1 express well in insect cells and can be readily purified. Preliminary data show that both proteins bind tubulin at low salt concentrations and that both influence the dynamics of pig brain microtubules. My goal is a complete functional analysis of Alp14 and Dis1, individually and in combination, to test candidate molecular mechanisms for Alp14/Dis1-catalysis of S. pombe microtubule dynamics. The Syphoviridae coliphage T5 is a well-suited model to study the assembly of large viral capsids. Biochemical and biophysical approaches were used to reconstitute in vitro the assembly pathway of its capsid. The T5 structure was recently solved from cryo-EM and image reconstruction. Its icosahedral capsid (T = 13) is built from the major head protein (pb8, 775 copies) forming both the pentons and hexons and from the portal protein (pb7, 12 copies) located at one vertex. Its assembly proceeds by steps. pb8 and pb7 first assemble into a precursor structure called prohead I, which is converted to prohead II by proteolysis of pb8 and pb7 by a head maturation protease. Packaging of the 121 kbp dsDNA is then driven through the portal pore by a molecular motor, the terminase. This promotes expansion of prohead II leading to the mature capsid. The different assembly steps and the conformational changes accompanying capsid maturation were characterized using Proheads I either self-assembled from the overproduced and purified capsid proteins or isolated from a phage mutant. These precursor capsid structures were analysed by Small Angle X-ray Scattering. The 3D structure of prohead II and of the expanded capsid were solved from cryo-EM. Our data show that the assembly process of a large icosahedral capsid can be efficiently reconstituted in vitro.",

Linse 1 1 Lund Univ., Department of biophysical chemistry, Sweden, 2 Lund Univ., Department of physical chemistry, Sweden Disease-causing amyloid fibril formation can be modulated by many factors including interactions with biological lipid membranes. An increasing amount of evidence suggests that the process of fibril formation in vivo and the mechanism of toxicity both involve membrane interactions. Alzheimer's is probably the most well-known amyloid disease and the associated amyloid beta peptide originates from the membrane incorporated amyloid precursor protein (APP). We use recombinant Abeta M1-40 and Abeta M1-42 produced in Escherichia coli, which allows us to perform large scale kinetics assays with good statistics where the amyloid formation process is followed in means of thioflavin T fluorescence. The lipid membranes are introduced in the system as large unilamellar vesicles composed of DOPC, DPPC and Sphingomyelin, with and without incorporation of cholesterol. We find that the phase behanviour of the membrane in the vesicles has a large effect on the lag time of the amyloid formation process for both Abeta M1-40 and M1-42. All membranes increase the lagtime to some degree but DPPC has the largest effect. By comparing different phases we can conclude that the translational diffusion in the membrane seems to be more important than the acyl chain ordering. Furthermore, electrostatics, concentration dependence and membrane addition at different time points in the amyloid formation process have been investigated.",

We report that, during stability studies of proteins or nucleic acids, such relaxation events can be observed on astonishing long time-scales. We first performed 'melting studies' with nucleic-acid duplexes by using linear variations of temperature (T) with time (t). We observed that even very low rates dT/dt could lead to a frozen state for temperature values below a sharp temperature range, and relaxation to equilibrium beyond that range. This allows defining a 'relaxation temperature' T r separating the two regimes. Numerical simulations very accurately described the related hysteresis phenomenon observed upon a heating-cooling cycle, which is the hallmark of departure from equilibrium. Analogous observations were made with protein oligomers submitted to either a variable pressure, or variable concentration in denaturant. Importantly, a single theoretical frame predicts that the critical relaxation value X r (X standing indifferently for temperature, pressure or denaturant concentration) depends on Ln(dX/dt). One may ask whether some thermosensor RNAs known for switching on or off genetic expression by 'feeling' a temperature variation, might also 'feel' dT/dt. If true, the exact switching temperature would depend on dT/dt and faster temperature changes would increase T r .",

After a lag phase, a conformational rearrangement of oligomers into fibrils, with a parallel orientation of the cross \u03b2-sheet structures, was observed. By AFM, different morphologies were also detected for fibrils that displayed high heterogeneity in their twisting periodicity and a complex hierarchical assembly. In addition, we also studied thermal and random aggregation. The PrP82-146 peptide was found to undergo several aggregation pathways, whose end products display different structural properties and intermolecular interactions.

The aggregation of this protein, which contains five proline residues (P108,P117,P120,P128,P138), is accelerated in vitro by FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs), a family of enzymes with a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity (PPIase). FKBPs catalyze the cis-trans conformational change of proline, often a rate limiting step in protein folding. To elucidate the role of the proline residues in aggregation, we constructed a mutant P(108,117,120,128,138)A \u03b1-syn . The kinetics of the aggregation of the mutant were studied with turbidity and Thioflavin T fluorescence (ThT). Turbidity measurements show the formation of early, ThT negative aggregates which is as fast for both WT and mutant. Fibril formation however is faster for the proline-deficient mutant. We also studied the effect of FKBP12 on the aggregation of the mutant. Although WT \u03b1-syn early aggregate formation is accelerated by the addition of 1 \u00b5M FKBP12, this effect disappears in the mutant. Addition of (1pM-1\u00b5M) FKBP12 accelerates the fiber formation of WT \u03b1-syn, which is abolished in the mutant. We can conclude that \u03b1-syn fiber formation is accelerated for the proline-deficient mutant, which suggests a role for the proline residues in fiber formation. Furthermore all accelerating effects of FKBP12 are abolished in the mutant which suggests that the PPIase activity of FKBP12 is responsible for the accelerating effect on the aggregation of WT \u03b1-syn. Materials used as gene delivery vehicles must be able to condense DNA into small sizes to facilitate transport and crossing various barriers. One of the polycations investigated for DNA compaction is chitosan, which has the advantage of being safe and biodegradable. As a step towards reducing the aggregation behaviour of DNA-chitosan complexes, chitosans were modified by grafting PEG-chains on the backbone. It is known that the transfection efficacy depends on the chitosan chain length. Additionally, the degree of pegylation might influence the condensation process. Here a systematic biophysical study of pegylated chitosans and how the interplay between chitosan chain length and degree of pegylation affect the compaction of DNA in terms of particle size and structure, stability in PBS and when exposed to serum, and transfection efficacy is presented. Three different chain lengths of chitosans are employed, and for each sample three pegylation degrees are investigated and the properties of the DNA-PEGchitosan complexes compared to complexes formed when employing the original, chitosan for DNA compaction. It is found pegylation of chitosans can be used to increase both the stability of the DNA-chitosan complexes when exposed to serum as well as increase their transfection efficacy in HEK293 cells.",

The interaction fe is governed by a critical linear charge density, z c , inversely proportional to the counterion valence. For highly charged PEs (z > z c , like DNA), the PEs attract the stronger the smaller is the counterion valence, because the fe is dominated by the entropic term due to condensation of counterions in a volume displaying a maximum at short distances. For weakly charged PEs (z < z c /2 ) the PEs remain undercritical in the whole separation range and therefore repel. For moderately charged PEs (z c /2 < z < z c ), the infinitely separated PEs are undercritical but become supercritical as they approach a critical distance and charge condensation and condensation volume expansion start: in these circumstances the PEs may attract if the counterion valence is sufficiently large. In the case of many DNA rods, hexagonal clusters may be formed. Upon interaction with hydrophobic surfaces, proteins show a tendency to expose regions that are normally buried in the hydrophobic core. Unfolding is generally perceived as an undesired process in studies aimed to anchor functional proteins at surfaces. Upon an upset of perspective the fine control of the unfolding/re-assembly process could be regarded as a strategy to build up molecular nanostructures for the development of organic-inorganic assemblies. We show that molecular layers patterned at the nanoscale, with longrange order properties extending over the microscopic scale, can be obtained upon adsorption of proteins onto the hydrophobic and ordered surface of pyrolytic graphite. Upon adsorption, proteins lose their native folding and polypeptide chains re-assemble on the surface in a layered fashion, forming a molecular bilayer. The first layer, in contact with the substrate, and the second molecular layer show corduroy-like nanopatterns of different periodicity, with a relative orientation between the first and second layer patterns of 30 \u2022 . Surface-induced protein unfolding and polypeptide chain reassembly according to a layered ordered structure is a rather general phenomenon since it is observed for different proteins irrespectively of their specific structural properties. The possibility of using these ordered molecular structures as templates for the subsequent patterned deposition of supramolecular aggregates will be discussed. Understanding protein-protein interactions and assemblies to control the hierarchical building of well-ordered supramolecular structures is highly relevant to new tailormade biomaterials. We previously evidenced that contrary to native calcium-loaded \u03b1-lactalbumin (holo \u03b1-LA), calcium-depleted form (apo \u03b1-LA) has the ability to selfassemble with lysozyme (LYS) to form different supramolecular structures in temperature-dependent manner.",

Aggregation of polyQ proteins is thought to be triggered by polyQ expansion but be strongly modulated by the protein context. In the attempt of understanding the molecular bases of polyQ diseases, we are studying the structures, interactomes and aggregation properties of selected polyQ proteins. Here, we present recent work on ataxin-3, taken as a representative example of the whole family. Ataxin-3 is a ubiquitin specific cysteine protease, involved in the ubiquitinproteasome pathway and known to bind poly-ubiquitin chains of four or more subunits. The enzymatic site resides in the N-terminal josephin domain of ataxin-3. We have characterized, using different biophysical techniques, the structure in solution and the aggregation properties of josephin both in isolation and in a ubiquitin complex. We demonstrate that interaction with ubiquitin strongly modulates the aggregation properties of ataxin-3 and suggest the importance of protein-protein interactions in preventing aggregation. Our study also provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms which determine ataxin-3 specificity for poly-ubiquitin chains of the correct length and cross-linking.

Seeger Institute of Physical Chemistry, University of Zurich, Switzerland Protein aggregation is an important topic of current protein research as it is associated with several human diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Type II diabetes. Although protein aggregation mechanisms and conditions have been comprehensively investigated, studies on the formation and the fate of protein aggregates in contact with solid interfaces are scarce. We have comprehensively investigated the structure of protein assemblies that form spontaneously upon protein adsorption on solid interfaces using a surface sensitive fluorescence imaging technique based on super critical angle fluorescence (SAF) detection. Combining this technique with FRET we not only succeeded to detect protein aggregates deposited on surfaces but also to characterize their behavior in real time, i.e., their emergence, growth, or spreading. The model protein BSA, for instance, was found to exhibit a certain tendency for aggregation in the buffer solution. These protein clusters can deposit onto solid surfaces and spread resulting in a large, flat structure after some time. 1 A different possibility how protein aggregates emerge on surfaces consists of a direct deposition of protein monomers to pre existing aggregates. Such a growth of protein aggregates on the surface has been observed in a model system using the protein \u03b1-synuclein, which is tightly associated with the Parkinson's syndrome. We present the results of a Spectroscopic Ellipsometry (SE) study of the adsorption process of Yeast Cytochrome c (YCC) on gold and graphite substrates, according to methods already applied to study the growth dynamics of organosulphur SAMS on gold [1] . SE investigation was carried out both in situ, at room temperature during protein deposition, and ex situ. On gold, SE data demonstrate the formation of an about 3-4 nm thick layer, consistent with the formation of a dense monolayer of YCC molecules, confirmed by AFM inspection. Both in situ and ex situ measurements were characterized by well defined spectral features related to the Soret band. Analysis of the fine position of this feature allowed to obtain information on the oxidation state of the iron ion of the heme group. SE data suggest that proteins have preserved their native structure. A completely different adsorption mechanism was observed on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) [2] . Ex-situ SE data on YCC/HOPG, supported by AFM observations, indicate the formation of an ultrathin molecular layer (\u223c0.7nm) related to complete protein unfolding at the hydrophobic surface. The role of phospholipid anisotropy in the stability of inverted hexagonal phase was considered. The equilibrium configuration of the system was determined by the minimum of the free energy involving the contribution of the isotropic and deviatoric bending and the interstitial energy of phospholipid monolayers. The shape and local interactions of a single lipid molecule were taken into account. The minimization with respect to the configuration of the lipid layers was performed by the Monte Carlo simulated annealing method. At high enough temperature the lipid molecules attain a shape exhibiting higher intrinsic mean and deviatoric curvatures which fits better into the inverted hexagonal phase than into the lamellar phase. For the mathematical model the advanced geometry with non-spherical cross-section of inverted hexagonal phase was calculated, resulting in lower energy in non-spherical cross-section. Theoretical results are in a good agreement with the small angle X-ray scattering experimental data. For a long while the conventional view has been that Alzheimer Disease is brought about by the beta-amyloid fibrils found in the senile plaques, but more recently it has been suggested that the main neurotoxic species would be the soluble oligomeric species, apparently prone to interact with cell structures and macromolecules potentially inducing neuronal dysfunction. Peptide-peptide interactions resulting in self-assembly phenomena of beta-amyloid yielding fibrils can be modulated and influenced by small organic molecules that might also be effective therapeutic tools to ideally target both oligomeric and fibrillar species. In this perspective, polycyclic aromatic molecules are of special interest because they might disrupt the molecular architectures precursors of beta-amyloid fibrils by means of weak, non-covalent aromatic interactions, like stacking interactions. We have performed an in vitro spectroscopic study (light scattering, circular dichroism, FTIR and fluorescence) of the effects on beta-amyloid fibrillogenesis of the natural pigment hypericin extracted from Hypericum perforatum. Our results show that, thanks to its structural characteristics and peculiar spectroscopic features, hypericin can be easily used to in vitro monitor the appearance of initial aggregation states of beta-amyloid peptides and, more importantly, that hypericin can interfere with the early stages of polymerization process, playing the role of an aggregation inhibitor.",

We studied these peptaibols in a dioleoylphosphatidylcholine monolayer supported by Hg using different electrochemical techniques (AC,VC,EIS). The experimental technique employed in the LINV (Clark microelectrode coupled to MIFE system) allows to measure oxygen flux in the solution contacting plant cell membranes, after treatment with different peptide concentrations. Preliminary results might indicate that short peptides can influence the whole metabolism of the plant and can therefore be used as \"elicitors\" in order to induce an acquired systemic resistance. Supported Biomimetic Membranes (SBM) were developed for protein-membrane interactions studies. Phospholipid vesicles were chemically linked onto amine grafted gold or glass surfaces; after an osmotic choc and liposomes fusion a continuous membrane bilayer was formed. The anchoring phospholipid molecule (DSPE-PEG-NHS) incorporated into the vesicles allowed the formation of a water-filled compartment between the surface and the bilayer. This first SBM model was used to monitor the membranes binding properties (dependent of calcium) of the adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA) from Bordetella pertussis. The SBM model was improved in order to study the translocation of the catalytic domain of CyaA across the bilayer. Naturally, the CyaA catalytic domain, when it reaches the target cell cytosol, associates with intracellular calmodulin (CaM) an activator of the adenylate cyclase activity of CyaA. To mimic this biological phenomenon, CaM was first immobilized on the surface (gold or glass) and in a second step membrane construction was performed over the CaM layer. The formation of the biomimetic membrane onto the CaM layer was monitored by SPR while membrane fluidity and continuity were analysed by fluorescence. Our results demonstrated the potentialities of SBM for the study of protein insertion into and translocation across biological membranes.",

Each \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunit has a modular structure with a large extracellular portion, a single transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic domain. Integrins activation mechanism is regulated by controversial conformational changes: while crystallography revealed similar bent shapes for resting and primed extracellular region constructs, ligand binding-induced large structural rearrangements in smaller constructs suggested extension, \"opening\" and tails separation. In a multiresolution approach, we used experimental and computed hydrodynamics to discriminate among \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin models built on X-ray, NMR, and EM data. In contrast with Xray data and 3D EM maps, an extension is needed to match the hydrodynamics of full-length, solubilized \u03b1IIb\u03b23; an electron tomography-based model fares better. Consistent with that, and with our averaged 2D EM images, a conformational change in the head region (\u03b23 hybrid domain swingout) coupled to a simple transmembrane helices shift matches priming agents-induced frictional changes in full-length \u03b1IIb\u03b23. Our multi-resolution study thus suggests that in integrins extension and immediate tail separation are uncoupled from head domain rearrangements following activation.",

We demonstrate for the first time by electron and laser microscopy and FTIR spectroscopy that the related, triphenylalanine peptide (FFF) assembles into rather planar nanostructures, rich in \u03b2-sheet. In addition, we conduct 0.4-\u00b5s replica exchange M.D. simulations of aqueous FF and FFF solutions in implicit solvent. The peptides coalesce into aggregates and participate frequently in open or ring-like linear networks, as well as elementary and network-containing structures with \u03b2-sheet characteristics. Polar and nonpolar interactions, as well as the surrounding aggregate medium contribute to the network stabilities. Within a network, consecutive peptides are linked by head-to-tail interactions; the aromatic sidechains of neighbor peptides assume approximately \"T-shaped\" orientations. These features are observed in FF crystals and could characterize early formations, or stabilize the mature nanostructures. The FFF aggregates acquire higher stability and peptide-network propensity compared to the FF aggregates due to energetic contributions 1,2 . Chlorophyll biosynthesis is light-dependent in angiosperms because the reduction of protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) into chlorophyllide is driven by a photoenzyme, NADPH:Pchlide oxidoreductase (POR). The unique properties of POR are due to its ability to assemble into dimers and oligomers within the prolamellar body (PLB) membranes of etioplasts studied mainly in leaves of dark-grown seedlings under laboratory conditions. We extended these studies to plant organs developed in the nature: cabbage heads, leaf primordia inside buds, pericarp-covered regions of sunflower cotyledons, potato tubers and seedlings germinating under the soil. In electron microscopic and fluorescence spectroscopic studies we found in many of these organs poorly developed PLBs in which POR was mainly in monomer state. As a consequence, the chlorophyll accumulation was slow and photo-oxidation processes occurred at illumination. In vitro we artificially induced the aggregation of POR monomers into oligomers in glycerol and sucrose containing buffers. This resulted in the increase of the photoreduction rate at the expense of photo-oxidation. These results underline the importance of the self-assembly of POR and the PLBs in chloroplast development and chlorophyll synthesis in nature.",

This study was aimed to characterise the biophysical properties of P2X 7 R compared to those of the variant lacking the entire C-terminus tail (trP2X 7 R) by measuring whole-cell currents and intracellular Ca 2+ variations. A mathematical model is used to describe the experimental results. In P2X 7 R expressing HEK-293 cells, the potent agonist 3'-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl adenosine 5'-triphosphate (BzATP) -evoked ionic currents depending on concentration and frequency of agonist applications. The currents were strongly inhibited by extracellular Mg 2+ in a noncompetitive way. By contrast, in trP2X 7 R cells, only high BzATP concentrations elicited small currents not affected by Mg 2+ . Interestingly, BzATP-induced Ca 2+ influx was present both in P2X 7 R and in trP2X 7 R cells, albeit in the latter the intracellular Ca 2+ elevation was smaller. Importantly, in trP2X 7 R the intracellular Ca 2+ rise maintained a competitive mechanism of Mg 2+ inhibition similar to that observed in P2X 7 R. The experimental data and the modelling findings support the tenet of a functional structure of P2X 7 R possessing two distinct conductive pathways.",

LLO exhibits optimal cytolytic activity at low pH but it is still able to bind membranes at physiological or even slightly basic pH values in a cholesterol-dependent fashion. High cholesterol concentrations in the membrane restore the low activity of LLO at high pH values. Based on this broad pH activity we investigated the electrophysiological properties of pores formed by LLO at room temperature and at different pHs using Planar Lipid Bilayer technique. LLO is able to form pores both at pH 5.5 and 7.5 with a similar permeabilizing ability and similar heterogeneous conductances in the range of picosiemes to nanosiemens. Cholesterol content directly correlates with LLO activity but it does not change the pore characteristics. Collectively, our results demonstrate that LLO activity at physiological pH cannot be neglected and that its action at sites distal to cell entry may have important physiological consequences for Listeria pathogenesis.",

The differences in DH-PRs and RyRs activities began to be evident after 3 weeks age when CICR formation has finished and became more expressed at the end of prehypertensive period (6 weeks). In response to 4-CmC (2 mM), a drastic increase in the rate of [Ca 2+ ] i accumulation (2.85\u00b10.8 times) in SHR myocytes was registered after 20 days age versus a decrease in the rates of Ca 2+ efflux from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of Wistar and WKY rat cardiomyocytes. BayK (80 \u00b5M) also induced more sharp [Ca 2+ ] i elevation in SHR myocytes (3.35\u00b10.25 times) as compared with Wistar (2.32\u00b10.16 times) and WKY (1.22\u00b10.09 times) ones of the same age. Our results argue that in SHR and WKY cardiomyocytes, as opposed to normotensive Wistar rats, gradual growth of DHPR activity is observed, which follows in parallel with CICR formation in the excitation-contraction coupling during early postnatal ontogenesis, and drastic activation of RyR2 in SHR myocytes after the process termination. Cytochrome ba 3 from Thermus thermophilus belongs to the large family of structurally related heme-copper oxidases. It accepts electrons from cytochrome c 552 at the P-side of the membrane and uses them to reduce oxygen to water. The energy released in this reaction is used for proton pumping across the membrane to form of an electrochemical proton gradient, used by the cell for formation of ATP. In this work we followed the kinetics of single-electron injection into the oxidized nonrelaxed state (O H \u2192E H ) of cytochrome ba 3 by time-resolved optical spectroscopy. Two main phases of electron transfer were resolved. The first (\u03c4\u223c17 \u00b5s) includes oxidation of Cu A and simultaneous reduction of both low and high spin hemes. The second (\u03c4\u223c420 \u00b5s) reflects reoxidation of both hemes by Cu B . This is in significant contrast to the O H \u2192E H transition of aa 3 -type oxidases, where the fastest phase is due to transient reduction of the low-spin heme a only. On the other hand, the single-electron reduction of the relaxed O state in ba 3 oxidase consisted of only rapid electron transfer from Cu A to heme b, which is similar to that in aa 3 oxidase. This indicates a functional difference between the relaxed O and the pulsed O H states of cytochrome ba 3 .",

In contrast to PLN, SLN stimulates maximal Ca 2+ uptake rates. SLN and PLN were incorporated in a bilayer lipid membrane (tBLM) tethered to a mercury electrode through a hydrophilic spacer. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements show that SLN forms channels permeable to chloride ion, weakly permeable to phosphate ion and impermeable to inorganic cations such as Na + and K + . A relationship between this property of SLN and its regulatory function on Ca-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum is proposed. ATP increases the permeability of a tBLM incorporating SLN to phosphate ion by associating to SLN with an association constant of 0.1 \u00b5M. An explanation for this behavior is provided. SLN can be identified with the \" P i transporter\" described by A.G. Lee et al. Conversely, both electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements and molecular dynamics simulations provide strong evidence that the pore of the pentameric form of PLN does not act as a chloride channel.",

Changes in cholesterol (Chol) content affected muscle and neuronal-type AChR organization and dynamics at the cell surface. Chol depletion produced gain-of-function of single-channel dwell time.

            "text": "The cyclododecadepsipeptide valinomycin is composed of two amino acids (L-Valine and DValine) and two hydroxyl acids (D-\u03b1-Hydroxy-isovaleric acid and L-Lactic acid). They form a 36membered ring of alternating amino and hydroxyl acids. In the cyclic structure, the polar groups are oriented towards the central cavity, whereas the rest of the molecule is relatively nonpolar. This enables the complexation of ions and valinomycin acts as a selective ion transporter (K + ) in lipid membranes. When one of the amino acids is exchanged, e.g one L-Valine by an L-Lysine, selected functionality can be engineered into the depsipeptide while maintaining its ion conducting properties. We induced several modifications into valinomycin, i.e. a Biotin binding unit or a Ferrocene group to induce an electrochemical active center. The ion conducting properties of the modified ion carriers have been probed in planar lipid bilayers as well as in solid supported membranes. The role of the membrane dipole potential (\u03d5 d ) is of a particular interest due to a powerful impact of this potential on the membrane permeability and lipid-protein interactions. Channel forming activity of gramicidin A, alamethicin, syringomycin E, HPA3 peptide, and OmpF porin are influenced by \u03d5 d . We have studied the effect of the membrane dipole modifier, phloretin, on the properties of single channels formed by a wild-type alpha-hemolysin in planar lipid bilayers. The single channel of a \u223c1000 pS conductance exhibits transitions into a number of low-conductance states as the transmembrane voltage exceeds \u223c130 mV (regardless of the voltage polarity). The phloretin addition to the bathing solutions (20 \u00b5M) (after the hemolysin channel was formed in the membrane) shifts dramatically the channel voltagedependence. Transitions to the low-conductance states are observed at \u223c30 mV. The effect of the phloretin addition was not observed in the case when it was introduced into the bathing solution before alpha-toxin. Since phloretin reduces \u03d5 d , the data may report on the influence of the electric potential profile on the energy of the low-conductance state of the alpha-hemolysin channel. The alternative explanation of this effect consists in a specific interaction between the phloretin and toxin channel.

Furini 1 1 Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford, Oxford, U.K., 2 Department of Electronics, Computer Science and Systems, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy Potassium channels can conduct K + ions with rates of up to \u223c 10 8 ions per second at physiological conditions, and they are selective to these species by a factor of 10 4 over Na + ions. Ion conduction has been proposed to involve transitions between two main states, with two or three K + ions occupying the selectivity filter separated by an intervening water molecule. The largest free energy barrier of such a process was reported to be of the order of 2-3kcal mol \u22121 . Here, we present an alternative mechanism for conduction of K + in K + channels where site vacancies are involved, and we propose that coexistence of several ion permeation mechanisms is energetically possible. Conduction can be described as a more anarchic phenomenon than previously characterized by the concerted translocations of K + -water-K + . We exploited the Au-deposited self-assembled monolayers of the type: [\u2212S\u2212(CH 2 ) n \u2212CH 3 ] (where n = 4, 9 and 15) with hydrophobically adsorbed redox protein -azurin to verify intrinsic electron transfer mechanisms according to the charge-transfer theory. The enthalpies and volumes of activation were determined through the variation of temperature (2-50 o C) and pressure (5-150 MPa) and experimental values were compared with those expected on the theoretical grounds. For the case of n = 4 the activation enthalpy definitely contains a large contribution originated from frictional-like dynamics of protein, and the activation volume has a small positive value. For n = 15 the value of activation enthalpy directly matches 1/4 of that for the reorganization energy, and the activation volume attains substantially negative value. For n = 9 we observed the intermediary performance. The whole kinetic pattern is consistent with the smooth changeover between adiabatic and nonadiabatic mechanisms of electron transfer.",

Because of its miniature size (94 amino acids) we use Kcv as a model system to study and manipulate basic properties of the K + channel pore. By analysing single-channel recordings we highlighted two voltage-dependent modalities of gating in Kcv: a slow and a fast gating. The presence of a slow gating is revealed by the very low (in the order of 1-3%) mean open probability. Slow gating is not related to the presence of a bundle crossing, as shown by accessibility of the cavity to MTS reagents. Channel opening might involve the transient formation of salt bridges between residues at the N and C termini of the channel, as suggested by mutational experiments inspired by molecular dynamics simulations of Kcv. Fast gating, analyzed by beta distributions, is responsible for the negative slope conductance in the single-channel I/V curve at extreme potentials and can be explained by depletion-aggravated instability of the filter region. ACA8 is a type 2B CaATPase with a regulatory N-terminus whose autoinhibitory action can be suppressed by binding of calmodulin (CaM). ACA8 N-terminus is able to bind a region of the small cytoplasmic loop connecting transmembrane domains 2 and 3. To define the role of this interaction in autoinhibition we have analysed a number of single point mutants produced by mutagenesis of ACA8 E252-N345 sequence. Mutation to Ala of any of 6 acidic residues (E252, D273, D291, D303, E302, D332) originates an enzyme with normal activity in the presence of CaM, but less CaMstimulated. These results highlight the relevance of a negative charge of the surface area of the small cytoplasmic loop in ACA8 autoinhibition. The most deregulated mutant is D291A ACA8, which is less activated also by controlled proteolysis or by acidic phospholipids; moreover, the phenotype of the D291A mutant is stronger than that of D291N ACA8 suggesting a more direct involvement of this residue in autoinhibition. Of the other mutants (I284A, N286A, P289A, P322A, V344A, N345A), only P322A ACA8 has a basal activity higher than that of the WT. These results provide the first evidence that the small cytoplasmic loop of a type 2B CaATPase plays a role in the attainment of the autoinhibited state. Complex I, the first member of the respiratory chain, serves as a proton pump catalyzing transfer of two electrons from NADH to ubiquinone coupled with the translocation of four protons across the membrane. So far the mechanism of energy transduction by Complex I is unknown. The NADH-binding cavity of Complex I has a very prominent feature -the presence of two invariant amino acid residues, glutamate and tyrosine, that are exposed to the solvent and located in the vicinity of the FMN, the primary electron acceptor in the enzyme. It was suggested that they might be involved in the binding of NADH through interaction with its nicotinamide moiety. In this work we assessed the function of corresponding Glu95 from the NuoF subunit of E. coli Complex I by mutation for glutamine. We showed that the negative charge of glutamate in the catalytic site is needed for the electrostatic repulsion of negatively charged phosphates of nucleotides. This process facilitates release of the product NAD + and, as a result, accelerates turnover of Complex I. We also found that glutamate, as one of the four negatively charged amino acid residues surrounding the isoalloxazine ring of the FMN at a distance of 4-6\u00c5, has a share of 40 mV of the overall 130 mV depression of the midpoint potential of this redox cofactor.",

In the present work we tested the hypothesis of isosmolal water transport using MDCK cells stably expressing the human sodium-glucose cotransporter (hSGLT1). Tagging hSGLT1 with EGFP enabled determination of its abundance in the plasma membrane by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). By monitoring tiny shifts in the concentration of water-soluble dyes in the vicinity of epithelia, FCS also allowed assessment of the water fluxes through confluent cell monolayers grown on permeable supports. Fitting the set of differential equations for the osmotic drift and for the back diffusion to the experimentally determined dye distribution permitted calculation of water flow both in the presence and in the absence of an osmotic gradient. From the calorimetric measurements of glucose transported across the cell monolayer, the water:glucose stoichiometry was derived. Dividing the increment in osmotic water flux due to hSGLT1 expression by the number of hSGLT1 copies in the plasma membrane resulted in a single transporter water permeability p f of 4.6 x 10 \u221214 cm 3 /sec. Thus, p f is close to the single channel water permeability of aquaporin-1. Consequently, even small osmolyte concentration differences between the cytoplasm and the basolateral buffer solution are sufficient to drive a substantial water flux.",

To test telmisartan's importance, we investigated its effect on electrical activities (EA) in diabetic (D) rats. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the Tel on EA of diabetic papillary muscle (DPM) with STZ-induced. In this study, we used four groups: (1) nondiabetic control (NDC) group (C), (2) Tel-treated NDC group (C+Tel), (3) diabetic group (D), and (4) Tel-treated D group (D+Tel). Diabetes was induced by a single i.v injection of STZ. In the study, membrane potential (MP) and action potential (AP) recorded after the establishment of diabetes. 1) MP was decreased significantly in both Tel-treated C and D rats (from -71,4\u00b10,7 to -64,7\u00b10,8 mV and from -69,9\u00b10,6 to -63,8\u00b10,7 mV). 2) AP unchanged in D group, whereas C+Tel and D+Tel groups showed increase in AP compared with C and D groups. 3) Repolarization time was prolonged in diabetic rats. 4) In C+Tel and D+Tel groups depolarization rate values increased significantly. On the other hand, in D group repolarization rate values descreased increased significantly compared to baseline values in Tel solution. As a result, our data suggest that the beneficial effects of Tel-treatment on the EA of the DPM appear to be due to the diminished K + currents. Cytochrome c oxidase is a terminal complex (CcO, Complex IV) of a respiratory chain that is located in an internal membrane of mitochondria or plasma membrane of bacteria. CcO is an electron transfer enzyme that reduces O 2 and uses the redox energy of the O 2 reduction for the proton translocation across the membrane. The electron-and proton-transfer generate a transmembrane electrochemical gradient (\u2206\u00b5H + ) that is used for ATP synthesis and all other kinds of work for the cell needs. The proton translocation mechanism of CcO requires 'channels' for the H + uptake and expulsion within the enzyme. The proton transfer occurs on a time-scale of micro-to-milliseconds. In order to study the proton transfer in CcO, a flow-flash approach based on a time-resolved FTIR spectroscopy was developed and applied. Our FTIR flow-flash approach (the measurement of the reaction of CcO with O 2 ) allows to reach a time resolution up to tens milliseconds. With this approach and site-specific mutants of CcO where the catalysis is slowed down, separate steps of the proton transfer were studied. The results showed that a unique cross-linked Tyr-280 (in a combination with a time-resolved visible spectroscopy and electrometry) serves as a proton donor for the dioxygen bond cleavage during the O 2 reduction by CcO. Furthermore, the protolytic transitions of Glu-278 -a key amino acid in the proton transfer mechanism in CcO -were shown for the first time.",

Marchetti Biophysics Institute ,CNR, Genova, Italy NMDA receptors are glutamate-gated channels distributed throughout the brain in the excitatory synapses and are critical for the nervous system function. They are assembled from two types of subunits, the essential NR1 and at least one NR2(A,B,C,D). Nickel (Ni) modulates the current flowing through NMDA receptors in a different way depending on the NR2 subunit present. We have recently identified several domains of the channel involved in Ni interaction, but many aspects of this modulation remain elusive. In this work we intended to determine the role of calcium (Ca) ions in the potentiation induced by Ni on the current through NR1/NR2B recombinant NMDA receptors. When Ni was applied in the presence of the physiological concentration of Ca (1.8 mM) , a voltage-independent potentiation of the current was observed with a Kp of 2.5 \u00b5M. This effect was progressively reduced by decreasing Ca concentrations and it was no more detectable with 0.18 mM Ca or in the presence of barium (Ba, 0.3 mM). In this last case the effect of Ni on NR1/NR2B receptors was mainly inhibitory (Ki(-60mV)=156\u00b5M). Therefore a physiological concentration of Ca is necessary to induce Ni amplification of the current. Many data in the literature indicate a correlation between Ca ion entrance through the channel, NMDA current facilitation and cytoskeleton; however, in our experiments, the application of the actin perturbing agent cytochalasin-D did not produce major modifications in Ni effect.",

Picco 1 1 Istituto di Biofisica, CNR, Genova, Italy, 2 LAMBS-MicroScoBio, Department of Physics, Genova, Italy Voltage-gated potassium channels are either homomeric or heteromeric tetramers composed of four \u03b1-subunits. In order to bring a contribution to the comprehension of channel heteromerization we have been investigating the properties of two plant voltage-gated K + -channels by using electrophysiological and fluorescence techniques. Experiments were focussed on KDC1 and KDC2, coexpressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. KDC1, the first potassium channel cloned from Daucus carota, belongs to the subfamily of \u03b1-modulatory silent channels as it doesn't form functional homomeric channels by itself. On the contrary KDC1 forms functional heteromeric channels when coexpressed with homologous subunits. KDC2, the last K + channel cloned from D. carota, belongs to the KAT1 family and shares an overall identity of 63% with KAT1. To correlate KDC1 functional properties with its localization in oocytes, KDC1 and/or KDC2 subunits were labelled with GFP and their properties investigated by confocal microscopy and voltage-clamp. We found that the KDC1-EGFP fusion protein is not targeted to the plasma membrane unless it is coexpressed with KDC2. Moreover electrophysiological experiments demonstrated that the heteromeric KDC1-KDC2 channel has altered selectivity and activation properties with respect to homomeric KDC2 channel. Circulating leukocyte sequestration in pulmonary capillaries is arguably the initiating event of lung injury in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) [1] . We present a microfluidic investigation of the roles of actin organization and myosin II activity during the different stages of leukocyte trafficking through narrow capillaries using specific drugs. The deformation rate during entry reveals that cell stiffness depends strongly on F-actin organization and hardly on myosin II activity, supporting microfilament role in leukocyte sequestration. In the transit stage, cell friction is influenced by stiffness, demonstrating that the actin network is not completely broken after a forced entry into a capillary. Conversely, membrane unfolding was independent of leukocyte stiffness. The surface area of sequestered leukocytes increased by up to 160% in absence of myosin II activity, showing the major role of molecular motors on microvilli wrinkling and zipping. Finally, cell shape relaxation was largely independent of both actin organization and myosin II activity, whereas a deformed state was required for normal trafficking through capillary segments [2] . [1] G.S. Worthen et al., Science, 245, 183-186 (1989) Excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal and cardiac muscle is tightly regulated by the calcium release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the ryanodine receptor (RyR). We could previously show that suramin is a potent activator of the RyR via the calmodulin binding site. Calmodulin shows dualistic action, i.e. activation or inhibition of the ryanodine receptor, depending on the absence or presence of Ca 2+ . Screening of suramin analogues identified NF676 as a use-dependent inhibitor of the skeletal muscle RyR (RyR1). Here we show that NF676 inhibits high affinity [ 3 H]ryanodine binding and single channel recordings of the purified RyR1. NF676 induced a reduction of open probabilities in a concentration dependent manner, with no effect on current amplitude and unitary conductance. Importantly, NF676 triggers flickering episodes of channel openings and closings before the RyR1 is frozen in a complete non-conducting state, which is fully reactivated by the RyR agonist ATP. Moreover, zwitterionic behaviour of NF676 facilitates plasma membrane permeation, which prevented caffeine induced Ca 2+ transients in skeletal muscle cells and cardiomyocytes. Conversely, IP 3 mediated Ca 2+ signals were not altered by NF676. This work was supported by Herzfelder'sche Familienstiftung and FWF .",

Protein dynamics has been extensively studied, but so far, the correlation of internal protein dynamics with the function of proteins was investigated only indirectly in steady-state experiments by variation of external parameters by variation of external parameters like temperature or hydration. The method comprises of an in-situ optical activation of a protein and a time-dependent sampling of the dymamic response using quasi-elastic neutron scattering. With the membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin, a light driven proton pump, we can demonstrate for the first time temporary alterations in the protein dynamics after triggering the working cycle. This observation is a direct proof for the functional significance of protein structural flexibility, in connection with the largescale conformational changes in the protein structure occurring during the operation of a \"molecular machine\". The Slow Vacuolar (SV) channels are ubiquitous in all tissues of higher plants. The SV channel is a non-selective cation channel permeable to both monovalent and divalent cations. SV currents recorded in a typical patch-clamp experiment require unphysiologically high cytosolic and low vacuolar calcium concentrations for full activation. We aim at looking for endogenous plant substances which might be able to modify or shift the voltage activation threshold of this channel towards more physiological conditions. Flavonoid Naringenin [Nar] is present in all plant species where it plays a central role in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. Nar is stored in the vacuoles in glycosylated form called Naringin. When Nar was added to cytosolic bath solution, we recorded a dose-dependent reversible decrease in SV channel activity. When we investigated the effect of Nar on the voltage dependence of the channel, we observed that the activation threshold of the SV channel is shifted towards more positive voltages. Our group has evidences that approximately 10% of the total SV current at high (e.g.> 50 mV) positive voltages is mediated by calcium. Therefore, in order to verify whether Nar affects both potassium and calcium conductance, we performed experiments by combining the patch clamp technique with fluorescence measurements using the fluorophore fura-2: both SV currents and calcium signals were abolished by 1 mM [Nar].",

We used the excised patch configuration and focused the photomultiplier to the tip of the recording pipette where the fluorescent dye was present (FLuoresence combined with Excised Patch = FLEP). This configuration has several advantages, i.e. absence of delay in loading the fluorophore, of interference by endogenous calcium buffers and of photobleaching. Here we present an application for the determination of fractional calcium currents (Pf) in a plant non-selective cation channel, showing that Pf can be modulated by cytosolic calcium and potassium. FLEP is very efficient for measuring small calcium currents (<1 pA) of sufficiently long duration; fluorescence signals are amplified by integration in time, as the calcium/fura-2 complex accumulates at the tip of the recording pipette and diffuses slowly. We propose this technique not only for the study of calcium transport pathways, but also for other transporters of divalent cations as nickel and manganese known to quench fluorescence thus reducing both 340 and 380 nm components. Moreover, using the appropriate fluorophore the technique may be extended to further ion species, e.g. BCECF for investigating proton transport pathways. Ref: We introduced an original method for the monitoring of the changes in the electrostatic surface potential, using the quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence by acrylamide or iodide. This approach opens new way to understanding the dynamic processes within the proteins. Our experiments revealed that the conformation of the Na + /K + -ATPase large cytoplasmic loop (C45) in the presence of the ATP (without magnesium) substantially differed from the conformation in the presence of Mg 2+ or MgATP or in the absence of any ligand not only in the sense of geometry but also in the sense of the electrostatic surface potential. Moreover, our data indicate that the effect of the ligand binding is not restricted only to the close environment of the binding site and that the information is in fact transmitted also to the distal parts of the molecule. This property could be important for the communication between the cytoplasmic headpiece and the cation binding sites located within the transmembrane domain. Influx of antibiotics into the periplasm of gram-negative bacteria is facilitated by porins that form channels in the outer membrane. We propose that certain natural antibiotics have been optimized by co-evolution to take advantage of the charge distribution in non-specific porins to achieve binding and thereby facilitating their uptake in bacteria. We investigate the permeation pathways of antibiotics into bacteria by reconstitution of a single porin into an artificial lipid bilayer and measuring the binding of antibiotic molecules through the time-resolved modulation of a small ion current. We have been able to characterize facilitated translocation of several antibiotics through Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes porins. Noise analysis of ion currents through a porin in the presence of effective antibiotics revealed binding kinetics at a single molecule level. We report for the first time temperature dependent antibiotic translocation that revealed complete energy profile. Combining these results with microbiological assays and molecular dynamics simulations, we conclude the molecular mechanism of antibiotic permeation. Our approach may contribute to the rational design of new antibiotics against clinical bacterial strains for the most efficient delivery to target sites.",

We utilized several imaging methods to measure Ca 2+ signals in cytoplasm ( ] Mit transients, observed both in EGTA-and BAPTA-buffering inside solutions. These data suggest that Ca 2+ sequestration by Mit is associated with the formation of microdomains and prevents Ca 2+ -dependent SOCC inactivation. We also found that inhibition of Mit under prolonged cell stimulation resulted in complete inhibition of SOCE as well as decrease and deceleration of ER refilling. Thus, Mit regulate calcium recycling and maintain the SOCE controlling dynamic interplay between SOCE and sustained ER refilling under prolonged stimulation. Bioelectrochemical devices composed of Au electrodes coated by self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of different composition and thickness are ideal systems to probe ET patterns and mechanisms for redox proteins.

We demonstrated the full adiabatic (frictional) control for the case of thinner SAMs, the intermediate (mixed) regime, and the complete changeover to the nonadiabatic mechanism (long-range tunneling) for the case of thick SAMs owing to the variation of electronic coupling, in a nice agreement with theoretical predictions.",

Neutron scattering data for monomeric bovine AAC in LAPAO does not give definite conclusions on the association state, because the large amount of detergent and lipids is imperfectly matched by contrast methods.

Arhem The Nobel Institute for Neurophysiology, Department of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, SE-171 77 Stockholm, Sweden Local anaesthetic, antiepileptic and antiarrhythmic drugs acting on Nav and hERG channels have been assumed to bind to aromatic residues in the internal vestibule; to F1764 and Y1771 in Nav (Ragsdale et al., 1996 and to Y652 and F656 in hERG (Mitcheson et al., 2000) . Despite a lack of such residues in Kv channels, local anaesthetics, antiepileptic and antiarrhythmics bind to Kv channels with a considerable affinity. To explore the role of aromatic residues for the binding we investigated the effect of bupivacaine, benzocaine, phenytoin and quinidine on Shaker channels mutated to residues corresponding to the most C-terminal of the two aromatic residues in the S6 segment of the Nav and the hERG channels, (V473Y and P474F respectively). The channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and the currents measured with the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. The results suggest that aromatic residues do not increase the binding affinity of the studied compounds to Kv channels. Rather, the affinity decreases (as reflected in typical K d values for bupivacaine on V473F, P474F and wildtype channels, being 550, 740 and 300 \u00b5M, respectively). Thus, aromatic residues seem not to be necessary for high-affinity binding of the studied compounds to Kv channels. How this relates to their suggested roles in the Nav and hERG channels, remains to be evaluated. (Molina et al, 2006) . The occurrence of a similar behavior in other channels points out to clustering and coupled gating as a potentially important drug target to modulate channel activity. We have identified molecular determinants involved in single and coupled channel gating in KcsA. First, we detected that clustering and coupled gating of KcsA is modulated by anionic lipid. Also, a model for the interaction between two KcsA open channels was built. The docking predicts intermolecular sites which includes the non-annular lipid binding site. This explains how an excess of anionic lipid disrupts interactions between channels, destabilizing clustering and coupled gating in KcsA. In addition, the docking model reveals molecular determinants involved in single and coupled channel gating. This interaction involves W87, which affects the neighbouring channel through specific interactions in the extracellular mouth stabilizing the selectivity filter in an open conformation. The coupled gating is also explained since this mechanism affects the opposite channel in a mutual manner. Finally, mutants KcsA E71A and KcsA W87A disrupt the coupled gating of KcsA, thus, supporting the model. We think that this coupled gating phenomenon could correspond to the second gate previously detected by fluorescence methods (Blunck, et al, 2006) .

In particular for \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, which have their target located inside the bacteria; the first step towards reaching inner part of bacterium is the cellular uptake. Ubiquitous presence of porins (such as for instance OmpF, OmpC) in the OM, function as a channel facilitating the transport of molecules (such as, for instance antibiotics) across the OM. Bacteria can exhibit resistant towards antibiotics by: (i) decreasing their uptake by under-expressing the porins or/and (ii) production of inactivating enzymes such as \u00df-lactamases. To combat the latter mechanism \u00df-lactamase inhibitors (such as, sulbactam for instance) are prescribed together with the antibiotics. Like the antibiotics, the inhibitors must penetrate the OM, the main path being through porins. It is thus evident the biological relevance of investigating the mechanisms by which porins can regulate entry/exit across the OM. To achieve this goal, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to explore the structure and dynamics of pores formed by OmpF and OmpC porin. From the analysis of data obtained from our simulations, we identified the key residues buried behind the L3 loop, which may play be crucial for porins to exert their biological role. As a case study, we report results about the diffusion of sulbactam through the two porins. The pentadecapeptide gramicidin forms a cation-specific ion channel in membrane environment. The two main conformations are the head-to-head helical dimer (HD) known as the channel conformation and the intertwined double helical form (DH) often referred to as non-channel conformation. In this comparative study [1] , the energetics of single potassium ion permeation by means of the potential of mean force (PMF) for both gramicidin conformations embedded in a DMPC bilayer has been addressed by molecular dynamics simulations. A significantly decreased free energy barrier by \u223c25 kJ/mol for potassium ion passage through DH as compared to HD is reported. Favorable electrostatic side chain-cation interactions in HD are overcompensated by phospholipid-cation interactions in DH. The latter are coupled to an increased accessibility of the channel entrance in DH due to distributed tryptophans along the channel axis. This result underscores the importance of the lipid environment of this channel not only for the equilibrium between the different conformations but also for their function as cation channels. ",

The major issue of MscL is to understand the gating mechanism driven by tension in the membrane. Although several models for the opening process have been proposed with Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, as they do not include MscLlipid interactions, it remains unclear which amino acids sense membrane tension and how the sensed force induces channel opening. We performed MD simulations for the mechano-gating of MscL embedded in the lipid bilayer. Upon tension in the bilayer, Phe78 in the outer helix was dragged by lipids, leading to a tilting of the helices. Among amino acids in the outer helix facing the bilayer, Phe78 at the water-lipid interface showed the strongest interaction with lipids, thus may work as a major tension sensor. Neighboring inner helices cross each other in the inner leaflet, forming the most constricted part of the pore. As tension increases, the crossings move toward the cytoplasm associated with an expansion of the constricted part. During the movement, a hydrophobic water block environment around the constricted part was broken followed by water penetration and permeation. The K + channel KcsA is an integral membrane protein from S.lividans, used as a model system for studies on ion channels and oligomeric membrane proteins. Its atomic structure has been solved by X-ray diffraction, which shows an assembly of four identical subunits around a central aqueous pore, including the so-called selectivity filter. This channel is able to permeate K + at high flux rate and it is blocked by Na + (physiological blocker). Fluorescence, circular dichroism and Fourier transform infrared experiments carried out in our laboratory demonstrated that K + and Na + are able to bind to KcsA in a competitive manner. This binding is indeed associated with channel conformational changes, which seem to be related to the permeation and blockade processes. To further investigate this phenomenon we carried out a detailed study of chemical and thermal denaturation of wild-type and mutant KcsA channels. These two types of experiments were in agreement and indicate that both cations are able to stabilize the channel through conformational changes, being K + the more efficient one, even more when lipids are present. Particularly, mutant channels with a structurally altered selectivity filter show that ion and lipid-induced global conformational changes are intimately associated to the conformation of this selectivity filter (conductive and non-conductive forms).",

V The RND transporters of the AcrAB-TolC (E.Coli) and MexAB-OprM (P.Aeruginosa) systems are able to export structurally and chemically different substrates outside bacteria through the membrane, being responsible of multidrug resistance. On the basis of crystallographic information, an extrusion process conceived as a three-cyclic peristaltic pumping has been proposed, but further microscopically well-funded investigations are needed to understand the mechanism. Using different computational methods like adaptive bias force (ABF) and targeted molecular dynamics (TMD), we have investigated the mechanism of substrate uptake and pumping at a molecular level. With the first method we have investigated the passage of antibiotics from the periplasm into the internal pore of the pump, while TMD has been used to assess the effect of conformational changes on the extrusion of drugs (which have been located into one of the proposed binding pockets). Comparison between the active pumps AcrB and MexB (which show different resistance patterns despite their homology) provide insights into the microscopic details of their functioning. In Arabidopsis thaliana there are twenty genes, grouped into three subfamilies, encoding for homologues of animal ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGLRs). Each protein displays a pore-forming loop, flanked by two conserved helices (plus a third C-terminal helix), a glutamate-binding domain and an N-terminal region. Through pharmacological and/or genetic approaches, many physiological functions have been attributed to plant GluRs, such as the regulation of cytosolic calcium, photomorphogenesis, water balance and carbon/nitrogen sensing and assimilation. According to the endosymbiotic theory, the cyanobacteria are considered to represent the precursors of the present chloroplasts. The first prokaryotic glutamate receptor (GluR0) was identified in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis. The putative products of the Atglr3.4 and Atglr3.5 genes display a possible targeting sequence for chloroplast location and show a high degree of homology with GluR0. Using specific antibodies and confocal microscopy, we have localized the two members of the AtGLR subgroup 3, GLR3. 4 and GLR3.5 (splicing variant) , to the chloroplast in Arabidopsis and to the inner envelope membrane in spinach. Electrophysiological experiments indicate the presence of an activity which is compatible with that of glutamate receptors. Furthermore, oxygen evolution measurements suggest that chloroplast-located glutamate receptors may play a role in the regulation of photosynthesis. Under extreme conditions many cells control their volume responding to osmotic challenges by unloading or loading solutes to recover their original volume. A faster volume regulatory role triggered by membrane tension has been disclosed for aquaporins in kidney proximal tubule cells, where AQP1 is the main water channel, using isolated brush border membranes. In conventional osmotic studies in animal cells it is common to disregard internal hydrostatic pressures because they are insignificant compared to osmotic forces. However, by using low osmolarity buffers in small radii vesicles, we detected a rise on the internal pressure that creates surface tension and causes membrane stress, with a negative outcome on aquaporin water permeability. These findings suggested a mechanism for volume regulation in kidney proximal tubule epithelia where massive solute and fluid transport occurs. To further explore aquaporin regulation by membrane tension, yeast cells were used as a model that could bare surface tension some orders of magnitude higher than animal cells due to the existence of a cell wall. The effect of increasing levels of membrane tension on yeast water channel activity was evaluated. An impairment of aquaporin activity correlated with the increase of membrane tension corroborates the volume regulatory role of aquaporin in different cells.",

We deleted the last 2 (YY) or 5 (KESYY) residues in Xenopus \u03b11 \u03b23 pumps made ouabain resistant by mutations Q120R-N131D (RD) or C113Y (C-Y), and then used two-microelectrode voltageclamp recording in Xenopus oocytes to measure pump currents as 10 mM ouabain-sensitive currents while endogenous Na/K pumps were silenced with 1 \u00b5M ouabain. Inhibition by external Na of steady outward pump current ([K] o =15 mM) at large negative voltages was somewhat weaker in both RD and C-Y pumps than in WT pumps, but was severely impaired in all C-terminal truncated pumps. Consistent with this, the voltage dependence of transient charge movements under Na/Na exchange conditions ([K] o =0 mM) was strongly shifted to more negative potentials in the truncated pumps relative to the parent RD or C-Y pumps, shifts comparable to those seen in WT pumps on decreasing [Na] o several-fold. Together, the results suggest that these C-terminal deletions lower the apparent affinity for external Na ions to bind and become occluded in the Na/K pump. The C-terminus therefore provides contacts important for stabilizing the occluded E1P(Na 3 ) conformation, regardless of the route of Na ion entry into the binding pocket. Muscle contraction is driven by molecular motors that adapt their energy utilization according to the demands made on them. We test the hypothesis that rate constants controlling the biochemical steps involved in ATP hydrolysis by myosin ATPase are affected by the force of the muscle. Here we use Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) of a fluorescently labelled ATP analogue to investigate changes in the environment of the myosin ATPase, caused by different loads applied to skeletal muscle. Single muscle fibres were subjected to cycles of stretches and releases in the presence of rigor solution and 10 \u00b5M of coumarin-labelled ATP. FLIM acquisition was synchronised with stretch/release cycles and force measurements, which allow us to investigate the effect of strain on the lifetime of the labelled ATP bound to the actomyosin complex. Characterization of the fluorescence decay by a bi-exponential function resolved the time constant of two populations, namely, free fluorophore (\u03c4 1 = 0.47 \u00b1 0.03 ns; mean \u00b1 S.D.) and fluorescent nucleotide bound to the actomyosin complex (\u03c4 2 = 2.21 \u00b1 0.06 ns at low strain). These experiments showed that while the time constant of the free fluorophore did not change with force, the time constant of the fluorescent nucleotide bound to actomyosin showed a linear dependence with the force applied to the muscle of 0.43 \u00b1 0.05 ps/kPa.",

Szollosi Department of Biological Physics, Eotvos University, Pazmany P. stny. 1A, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary Conventional kinesin is a two-headed motor protein, which is able to walk along microtubules processively by hydrolyzing ATP. Its neck linkers, which connect the two motor domains and can undergo a docking/undocking transition, are widely believed to play the key role in the coordination of the chemical cycles of the two motor domains and, consequently, in force production and directional stepping. Although many experiments, often complemented with partial kinetic modeling of specific pathways, support this idea, the ultimate test of the viability of this hypothesis requires the construction of a complete kinetic model. Considering the two neck linkers as entropic springs that are allowed to dock to their head domains and incorporating only the few most relevant kinetic and structural properties of the individual heads, we have developed the first detailed, thermodynamically consistent model of kinesin that can (i) explain the cooperation of the heads during walking and (ii) reproduce much of the available experimental data (speed, dwell time distribution, randomness, processivity, hydrolysis rate, etc.) under a wide range of conditions (nucleotide concentrations, loading force, neck linker length and composition, etc.). Besides revealing the mechanism by which kinesin operates, our model also makes it possible to look into the experimentally inaccessible details of the mechanochemical cycle and predict how certain changes in the protein affect its motion.",

While in vivo this nanoscale soft machine consumes ATP, it may be driven by external fluctuating electric fields, no matter they are periodic or random. Theoretically, the motor conformations can be described by a conformation vector V(t) governed by a multi-dimensional kinetic equation.

            "text": "In situ measurements of the molecular motor of muscle with nanometer-microsecond resolution In a contracting muscle, arrays of the dimeric motor protein myosin II pull the actin filament towards the centre of the sarcomere during cyclical ATP driven interactions. When the external load is smaller than the array force, the sarcomere works as a motor, converting metabolic energy into mechanical work; when the external load is larger than the array force, the sarcomere acts as a brake resisting the load with reduced metabolic cost. To investigate the molecular basis of the work production and the braking action of muscle, we use sarcomere-level mechanics and X-ray interferometry in intact single cells from frog skeletal muscle. During isometric contraction, each motor bears a force of about 6 pN. During shortening against high and moderate loads, the number of myosin motors attached to actin reduces in proportion to the external load while the force per attached motor is maintained similar to the isometric value (Piazzesi et al., Cell 131, 784-95, 2007) . Rapid stretches of 1-5 nm between each overlapping set of myosin and actin filaments in a muscle sarcomere cause the stiffness of the array of myosin motors to increase up to twice the isometric value within 2 ms (Brunello et al., PNAS USA 104, 20114-19, 2007) , indicating that the high resistance of active muscle to stretch is due to recruitment of the second motor domain of the myosin molecules with the first domain already attached to actin. Supported by MiUR and Ente CRF (Italy), NIH (USA), MRC (UK), EMBL, ESRF. Kinesin-1 is a molecular motor that moves cellular cargo along microtubules. Its functional mechanism is well understood for individual motors. However, the way that many kinesin-1 motor proteins bound to the same cargo move together is not. We addressed the structural basis for this phenomenon using video microscopy of single microtubulebound full-length motors and various spectroscopy methods were employed to study synthetic peptides derived from Hinge-1 region. These Peptides show an unexpected profile of secondary structure forming propensities. Video microscopy of single microtubule-bound full-length motors reveal the sporadic occurrence of high compliance states alternating with longer-lived, low compliance states. The deletion of Hinge-1abolishes transitions to the high compliance state. From the results we hypothesize that strain accumulated during multiple kinesin motility populates the high compliance state by unfolding helical secondary structure in the central Hinge 1 domain flanked by unordered regions, thereby preventing the motors from interfering with each other in multiple motor situations. Titin is a giant protein of vertebrate skeletal and cardiac muscles. Cardiac titin is expressed in two main isoforms: short N2B (\u223c3000 kDa) and long N2BA (\u223c3400 kDa). We have studied changes of titin isoform composition in myocardium of hibernating ground squirrels and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Using electrophoresis we have revealed considerable decrease (by 2-3 times) in the content of titin relative to myosin heavy chains in SHR heart as compared with that for normotensive rats. Surprisingly that the data of qRT-PCR showed the increase in mRNA content of N2BA and N2B-isoforms in hypertrophic heart more than 2 times in comparison with norm. We suppose that such a result is an effect of depressed translation of mRNAtitin in pathology. We have observed the decrease (by 1,5 times) of total titin amount in heart of hibernating animals in comparison with that for summer active animals. However N2BA/N2B ratio in the heart upon hibernation was increased by 2 times. Similar trend was not revealed for the mRNA level of corresponding isoforms, although we have showed the decrease of mRNA of both titin isoforms in heart of hibernating ground squirrels as compared to their content of summer animals. The decrease in total mRNA level may be explained by repressed transcription or mRNA degradation in the cell during hibernation. These discrepancies in protein and mRNA levels may be considered as the posttranscriptional regulation of titin isoforms expression. Actomyosin cross-bridges formed when the globular heads of myosins bind to actin filaments are the molecular engines that drive muscle contraction, fuelled by ATP hydrolysis. Critical to this process is the change in shape of the cross-bridge and the change in the interactions with actin, in response to force applied to the muscle, and to the status of the nucleotide in the binding pocket. Although molecular detail is known from X-ray crystallography and biochemistry, understanding of the interplay between cross-bridge shape and chemical state requires studies in muscle fibres generating force. We use Fluorescence Life Time Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) as a probe of the cross-bridge environment.With a fluorescent analogue of ATP 1 , fluorescence life-time (FLT) changes when the crossbridge binds to actin. Now, we show preliminary experiments on the effect of force on FLT. The Essential Light Chain of myosin (ELC) is a \u223c20 kDa peptide that wraps around a 9nmlong \u03b1-helix of the myosin cross-bridge known as the lever arm which tilts during force generation. Using a recombinant ELC, labelled with a fluorophore at a strategic Cys, we replace the native ELC and introduce the fluorescent ELC in muscle fibres. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that the ELC fluorophore also is sensitive to force applied to the muscle fibre. In addition, F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy transfer occurs between the nucleotide and ELC fluorophores, opening the way for studying structural changes in cross-bridges during force generation by FRET.",

There are three fundamental dimensions: the mass, m; the space, l; and the time, t. From these three dimensions are built up all the physical dimensions. As an example the acceleration, a, is given by, a=l.t \u22122 . Once the direction and versus are settled the modulus fully defines the physical effect of the acceleration. What about the force? The force, F, is given by, F=m.a. At variance with the acceleration, once the direction and versus are settled, the modulus does not define the physical and the biological effects of the force: the same force is generated by an infinite number of mass-acceleration couples that display different physical and biological effects. The same occurs with the load. Thus defining the load that opposes the contractile force does not define the contractile system. In the studies on muscle contraction the acceleration of the load is not considered nor it is provided a way to extract this information. Thus these systems are poorly defined from the physical as well as from the biological point of view. Models of muscle contraction that consider explicitly both the mass and the acceleration of the load show that, at the same load, the decrease of the acceleration of the load significantly delays the pre-steady state of the contraction and decreases the stiffness of the active fibre.",

Nazionale TASC, Trieste, Italy Polymerization of actin filaments is the main source of motility in lamellipodia and is controlled by many regulatory proteins. The underlying molecular mechanisms are only partially understood and now a determination of the dynamical properties of force generation is needed. Using optical tweezers we measured with millisecond temporal resolution and pN sensitivity the force-velocity (Fv) relationship and the power dissipated by lamellipodia of dorsal root ganglia neurons. When force and velocity are averaged over 3-5 s, Fv relationships can be flat. On a finer time scale, random occurrence of fast growths and sub-second retractions become predominant. Maximal power dissipated by lamellipodia over a silica bead with a diameter of 1 \u00b5m is 10 \u221216 W. Due to the presence of adhesion forces, beads in close contact with a lamellipodium can seal on its membrane reducing the amplitude of Brownian fluctuations often by more than 10 times. Under these conditions, when lamellipodia grow and push the beads, discrete jumps varying from about 5 to 50 nm are detected. When lamellipodia retract, pulling the beads, no discrete events are observed. Our results on the dynamical properties of force generation are: a) force generation is a probabilistic process; b) underlying biological events have a bandwidth up to at least 10 Hz; c) fast growths of lamellipodia leading edge alternate with local retractions; d) force generation is produced in discrete steps with varying amplitude up to 0.2 pN.",

Howard MPI-CBG, PfotenhauerStr 108, 01307 Dresden, Germany Asymmetric cell division, where the content of the two daughter cells -as well as their sizes -differ, is found in many organisms. Strikingly, the spindle, first centered, starts to be displaced out of the center only in late metaphase. In C elegans embryo, the spindle rocks and is posteriorly displaced during anaphase by force generators asymmetrically localized on cell cortex. Prior to anaphase onset, the spindle is usually assumed to be centered by the same pulling force. It thus requires the force generators to be carefully repressed to distribute forces symmetrically. On live embryos, we measured positional fluctuations of centrosomes during metaphase with 20 nm accuracy. Fourier analysis shows an extremely accurate centering respect to the number of force generators and microtubules. Furthermore, spectrum is close to a Lorentzian, modeled by a spring and a dashpot, suggesting a spindle centering more likely by pushing on microtubules than pulling. Deviation at high frequencies indicates a subdominant pulling force. RNAi of gpr-1/2, known to control force generation, increases slightly centering accuracy; this result supports the hypothesis of an independent centering mechanism. Conversely, zyg-9(RNAi), a microtubule growing factor, decreases centering accuracy, modeled spring stiffness and damping modulus. Conclusion: first, the spindle centering mechanism is independent of cortical pulling force generator. Second, microtubules pushing is likely to center the spindle. Mechanical forces are important in the regulation of cellular adhesion and migration. The Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) has been suggested to transduce cellular forces and govern cell migration. To obtain more insight in the functioning of FAK, a FRET-based optical biosensor for FAK was designed to relate integrin-mediated conformational changes in its FERM domain to focal adhesion behavior during cell spreading and migration in living cells. Imaging of the kinetics of FERM-based FAK conformational changes in spreading cells revealed two consecutive stages of focal adhesion activation. Heterogeneous FERM conformational responses were observed in individual focal adhesions of adherent motile cells, with the active FERM conformation being enriched in growing and sliding FAs, but not in stable and shrinking focal adhesions. Inhibition of the cellular actomyosin system revealed the involvement of Rho-ROCK rather than MLCKinduced tension signaling in the modulation of the FERM response. Our results place the FERM conformational change of FAK at the interface between integrin and force sensing.",

The advantage of using MDCC-PBP is that the control of mechanochemical coupling can be examined from the onset of force production and as it progresses toward the steady state.

Syn overexpression and the expression of its A30P mutant participate in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Many roles have been proposed for Syn, including the regulation of synaptic vesicle pools and of neurotransmitter release. The actin cytoskeleton regulates many aspects of synaptic function and its dysregulation may be a cause of neurodegeneration. Working both in cell-free and in vivo conditions we demonstrate that Syn and the A30P mutant have different effects on the actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Our results show that Syn binds actin, and decreases actin polymerization rate probably by monomer sequestration. On the contrary, A30P accelerates actin polymerization in vitro and disrupts the cytoskeleton of intact cells. In particular, during dynamic cytoskeleton remodeling, A30P induces the assembly of discrete actin-rich foci. Actin trapping and the impairment of filaments reassembly lead to inhibition of cell movement and of the re-establishment of cell-cell contacts. In A30P expressing cells cytoskeleton-based processes, such as cell migration and the exo/endocytic traffic are inhibited. Elucidating the dynamics of Syn interaction with actin may contribute to the understanding of its role in neuronal physiology as well as in neurodegeneration.",

Moreover, the conformation energy of the crossbridges attached serves as the force source as well. We state that part of the energy release transforms into the energy of oscillations of myosin proteins; the other part goes into thermal energy of the sarcoplasmic solution. Interaction of the oscillating myosin system with the sarcoplasmic solution controls the process of force generation by a muscle.

This study aims to elucidate the role of the cytoskeleton, cell-matrix and cell-cell junctions in transducing fluid shear stress into intracellular signals in ECs. By using microcontact printing of proteins, we design substrates with defined adhesive islands in order to control shapes of living cells. This confinement of ECs allows to study the organization and the contractile activity of the cytoskeleton in order to redistribute their intracellular forces in response to externally applied forces. We design microfluidic channels with sizes and geometries close to small blood vessels to apply a physiological range of shear stresses on ECs. Our results indicate that cells deposited on a precisely defined adhesive area inside microchannels and subjected to shear stress reorganize their cytoskeleton, their focal adhesions and adherens junctions in response to blood flow.

Here, we propose a novel strategy for MS symptoms treatment. We modeled neuron by ORCAD software and simulated the action potential propagation along the axon in normal condition. Our model simulated normal neuronal behavior. Then we destroyed the myelin sheet as it occurs in MS and observed destroyed AP propagation as it was reported in MS disease. We investigated the effect of changes in the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) threshold on the efficiency of AP propagation. The results demonstrated that reduction of VGSC threshold improves the propagation of AP by increasing the amount of sodium flux during AP propagation. Although, some researches have proposed VGSC blocker as MS symptom treatment, our result suggests that the increase of sodium current produced by reduction of VGSC threshold, improves AP propagation and probably cure some MS symptoms. So, we suggest that VGSC gating modifiers can be considered as novel strategy for MS treatment. Surely, this results needs to be confirmed by experimental studies.",

Pusch Istituto di Biofisica, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Via de Marini 6, 16149 Genova, Italy CLC-Ka and CLC-Kb are highly homologous Cl \u2212 channels expressed in the kidney and the inner ear where they mediate transepithelial chloride transport. Both channels heteromerize with the beta subunit barttin. Mutations in CLC-Kb and barttin genes lead to Bartter's syndrome. We analyzed the modulatory effect of extracellular Ca 2+ and H + on CLC-K channels using the Xenopus oocyte expression system. CLC-Ka currents increased with increasing [Ca 2+ ] ext without full saturation for [Ca 2+ ] ext up to 50 mM. However, in the virtual absence of Ca 2+ , CLC-Ka currents are about 18 % of currents measured in 10 mM [Ca 2+ ] ext , demonstrating that Ca 2+ is not strictly essential for opening. Vice versa, CLC-Ka was blocked by increasing the [H] + ext with an almost complete block at pH 6. Among various reaction models tested, the model that best fitted all state-steady data predicts an allosteric regulation of channel opening by separate binding sites for Ca 2+ and H + . Moreover, the best fit suggests that one Ca 2+ and two H + bind to the channel. Kinetic analysis of current responses upon [Ca 2+ ] ext and pH jumps confirmed the allosteric character of modulation. In support of the presence of two separate binding sites we identified several mutations that selectively altered Ca 2+ or H + sensitivity. Our data represent a first step towards a molecular picture of Ca 2+ and proton regulation of CLC-K channels and suggest that it is of physiological relevance.",

We recorded currents mediated by a major neuronal subtype of L-VDCCs (Ca v 1.2C, \u03b2 1 b, and \u03b1 2 \u03b4 1 ) expressed in CHO cells. A five-minute application of 0.1 mg/ml HA potentiated L-VDCC currents at -20, -10, 0 and +10 mV by approximately 50%. Analysis of Boltzmann curves showed that HA increased maximal conductance rather than other parameters (V 0.5 or k ). Treatment with hyaluronidase removed endogenous HA in murine hippocampal slices and specifically impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) induced at CA3-CA1 synapses by repetitive theta-burst stimulation. Blockade of L-VDCCs reduced LTP in control slices to the levels seen after hyaluronidase treatment. A potentiation of L-VDCCs with Bay K 8644 fully restored LTP after hyaluronidase treatment. Removal of HA reduced Ca 2+ transients elicited by backpropagating action potentials in individual dendritic shafts and spines of CA1 pyramidal cells, whereas pretreatment with nifedipine fully occluded this effect. Thus, HA potentiates postsynaptic L-VDCCs and by this way influences use-dependent synaptic plasticity.",

In addition, where studied, this was accompanied by down-regulation of outward (mainly potassium) currents. This has led to the CELEX (\"cellular excitability\") hypothesis of cancer according to which metastatic cell membranes are excitable and this promotes their hyperactivity. Importantly, the VGSC genes expressed are embryonic splice variants, which are normally developmentally regulated, hence the phenomenon is 'oncofetal'. In breast cancer, where the predominant VGSC is Nav1.5 the neonatal and adult forms are significantly different and this is reflected in channel activity whereby the neonatal VGSC has much slower inactivation kinetics. The double-charge change at position 211 is critical for this difference. The slow kinetics results in much greater influx of Na + into cells and one consequence of this is activation of protein kinase A. This is a tonic effect and, under steady-state resting conditions, it results in a positive feedback effect promoting post-translational trafficking of VGSC protein to plasma membrane. The unique amino acid sequence of the spliced region has enabled the production of a polyclonal blocking antibody specific to neonatal Nav1.5. It is concluded that VGSCs represent novel biophysical targets for clinical management of metastatic disease.",

ClC-4 and ClC-5, mutations of which lead to Dent's disease, are secondary active Cl \u2212 /H + antiporters, similar to the bacterial ClC-ec1, and with identical 2 Cl \u2212 : 1 H + stoichiometry. Cl \u2212 and H + transport activity of the exchanger CLCs depends on two Glut residues. Mutating a 'gating glutamate' (E211 in ClC-5) converts the exchanger into anion conductances. Neutralizing the 'proton glutamate' (E268), but not its replacement by some other titratable groups, abolishes Cl \u2212 and H + transport. Noise analysis indicated that ClC-5 switches between silent and transporting states with an apparent unitary conductance of 0.5 pS, indicating a very large transport turnover. NO 3 \u2212 uncouples H + transport but mutating the highly conserved S168 to P, as found in the plant NO 3 \u2212 / H + antiporter atClCa, led to coupled NO 3 \u2212 : H + exchange.

Experimental results have shown that different class of inhibitors (Benzimidazole, Imidazoquinolines and Pyridoxyquinolines), have resistant mutations located in the finger domain of the RdRp. All the reported mutations are spatially very close to each other. Thereby, indicating that binding sites of NNI's may lie in the finger domain for these different class of inhibitors.Herein, we have utilized docking procedure to investigate binding sites, binding modes as well as binding affinity of different class of inhibitors.We then used all atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the stabilizing interaction between inhibitor-receptor pairs. Our MD results are in good agreement with experimental data and provide deep insights into the dynamical features of the high affinity inhibitorreceptor binding. Thus identifying the binding modes of our inhibitors and mechanism leading to inactivity of the enzyme can help us to build a microscopically well-funded picture of the functioning of these enzymes.

Using the autofluorescent properties of mHTI we determined the stability of the HLA-B*2705/mHTI-pLMP2 complex. Photoswitching from Z \u2192E results in a decrease of HLA-complex stability. Based on computer modeling this decrease is due to a reduced interaction of the peptide C-terminus with HLA-B*2705. Truncated hemoglobins (trHbs) are heme proteins present in bacteria, unicellular eukaryotes, and higher plants. Three phylogenetic groups (N, O, and P) have been identified in trHbs. The crystal structure of truncated hemoglobin O of B.subtilis, does not show an evident tunnel/cavity system connecting the protein active site with the solvent, a fact that cannot be easily rationalized considering the very high oxygen association rate. Moreover, resonant Raman results of the CO bound protein, showed that a complex hydrogen bond network exists in the distal cavity, making it difficult to assign unambiguously the residues involved in the stabilization of the bound ligand. For these reasons we performed classical molecular dynamics simulations of the oxy, carboxy and deoxy protein, and computed the free energy profiles associated with ligand migration to the active site. Our results suggest that there is a key residue, GlnE11, that may present an alternate conformation in which a wide ligand migration tunnel is formed, consistently with the kinetic data. The results for the CO and O 2 bound protein show also that GlnE11 is directly involved in the stabilization of the coordinated ligand, playing a similar role as TyrB10, and TrpG8 in other trHbs. Our results not only reconcile the structural data with the kinetic information, but also provide additional insight about the general behaviour of trHbs.",

We have recently established a generic method for patterning NTA functionalized surfaces by selective photodestruction via a light induced Fenton reaction. Efficiency of different transition metal ions for catalyzing this reaction was tested. Functionality of the patterned protein was confirmed using the interaction between Interferon\u03b12 and its receptor. Implementation of this technique in a confocal laser scanning microscope allowed us to control surface density of binding sites, providing the possibility to vary the surface concentration of immobilized proteins in a spatially resolved manner. We also applied this approach for exploring guided transport of microtubules by kinesin selectively immobilized onto TrisNTA patterns. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder, leading to pathological damage at the level of joints, associated with the HLA class II allele HLA-DR4. Although etiology of RA is unknown, type II collagen (CII) is a potential antigen candidate and it is believed that T cell responses in collagendependent RA are directed towards the immunodominant pathogenic epitope CII(261-273). Despite recent advances in characterization of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and T-cell receptor (TCR) contacts in this epitope, the atomic details of TCR-CII(261-273)-MHC complex are not known. Here, homology modeling and molecular docking studies have been used to derive a three-dimensional model of TCR \u03b2 chains, obtained from a DR4+ subject, in complex with CII(261-273)/HLA-DR4. The best complex from docking was further refined using molecular dynamics simulations for 20 ns. The proposed model represents a reasonable structural basis for understanding CII(261-273)-MHCII complex recognition by TCR and for rational design of inhibitors targeting TCR-pMHC interface.",

Dalafave The College of New Jersey, Ewing, NJ 18940, USA This work addresses important questions of protein-ligand interactions and selective protein recognition. Proteinligand bindings are crucial for many cellular processes. Dependable methods for predicting binding sites would lead to a better understanding of proteins' selective recognition and would, in turn, help research on fighting diseases. Presented here is a study of interactions between the WD domain found in a regulatory protein COP1 and the motif V-P-E/D-\u03a6-G (\u03a6=hydrophobic residue) found in a transcription factor HY5. COP1 and HY5 proteins have opposing roles in developmental regulation. COP1 can repress HY5 by directly binding with it. The repression involves specific interactions between the WD domain and the motif V-P-E/D-\u03a6-G. Previous experimental research showed that mutations in the motif's V-P pair resulted in a large decrease in HY5 repression. To study effects of similar mutations, residues in the motif V-P-E/D-\u03a6-G were systematically substituted with other residues. Interactions between the mutated motif and the WD domain were studied. Distributions of binding sites, bond lengths, local shape complementarity, and interaction potentials were modeled for each residue substitution. The study identified binding sites critical for the COP1-HY5 binding. Some HY5 residues in the vicinity of the motif were also found to be important in the binding. The significance of the results for understanding selective protein recognition is discussed.",

Matulis Laboratory of Biothermodynamics and Drug Design, Institute of Biotechnology, Vilnius, Lithuania Thermal shift assay determines the effect of ligand binding on the protein thermal denaturation equilibrium. Several models have been derived to describe the general cases of protein-ligand binding. First, the model describing protein stabilization and destabilization by ligand binding to the native and unfolded states. Second, the split of protein melting transitions by tightly binding ligands is presented when the transition of free protein and ligand-bound protein occur separately. Mathematical equations describing the protein unfolding and ligand binding thermodynamic parameters at various temperatures are presented. The protein melting temperature shift can be determined by various techniques such as differential scanning calorimetry, circular dichroism, and intrinsic or extrinsic fluorescence. The advantages of fluorescent techniques are presented. The melting temperature shift caused by ligand binding is dependent on the thermodynamic parameters of protein unfolding and ligand binding, including enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity, thus allowing determination of binding thermodynamics. Application of the models in the design of Hsp90 chaperone and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors is discussed. Comparison with isothermal titration calorimetry data is presented. Recent reports have shown that the bacterial redox protein azurin can enter into cancer cells and induce apoptosis by stabilizing p53. The formation of a complex between the two proteins has been demonstrated, but little is known about binding features. For the first time, we show here that azurin binds to the N-terminal region of p53 with a dissociation constant in the 5-10 \u00b5M range. Trp phosphorescence lifetime measurements revealed conformational changes of azurin induced by the interaction with p53(1-63). Acrylamide quenching of Trp phosphorescence also indicated a significant increase of the overall flexibility of azurin upon binding to p53 . No change of the fluorescence emission of p53(1-63) was detected in the presence of azurin. The latter finding suggests that W23 of p53 is not directly involved in domain binding to azurin, indicating that the binding site is distinct from that of MDM2. The present results may assist the design of novel cancer treatments based on p53 stabilization by azurin.",

This multifunctional protein has ligand-binding and transport properties, antioxidant functions and enzymatic activity [1] . Bilirubin interacts with albumin in order to be transported from the blood to the liver where it is secreted. The interaction occurs specifically in HSA I-domain of its three domains [2] . In our work, we investigate the interaction between HSA and bilirubin by Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation (QCM-D) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) [1, 3] . Albumin was adsorbed on negatively charged silicon oxide. However, HSA was removed after rinsing with PBS. HSA adsorbed on positively charged polyelectrolyte multilayers leads to a stable layer of surface mass density of 272 ng/cm 2 . Cross linked albumin with glutaraldehyde after its adsorption on NH 2 -terminated thiols is also stable reaching surface mass density of 296 ng/cm 2 . A preliminary bilirubin adsorption results on cross linked HSA substrate show that 200 ng/cm 2 is immobilized. Taking into account that HSA-bilirubin stoichiometry is 1:1, the outcome demonstrates that the 70% of HSA I-domains remain active. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are short positively charged polypeptides. They are important due to their potential to provide an alternative to conventional therapy against bacterial infections. rBPI 21 is a 21 kDa peptide based on the Nterminal region of the neutrophil bactericidal/permeabilityincreasing protein (BPI). It was shown that this AMP possesses bactericidal effects on Gram-negative bacteria and higher affinity for lipopolysaccharide (LPS), neutralizing its effect. The peptide use against meningitis, is in Phase III clinical trials. Here, we demonstrate that rBPI 21 promotes aggregation of negatively charged large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) and LPS aggregates, by dynamic light scattering, while for zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine (POPC) LUV the size remains unchanged. The aggregation increases with peptide concentration until peptide promotes massive aggregation followed by sample flocculation/precipitation. With the rBPI 21 -lipid interaction there is a progressive change in the zeta-potential of the LUV systems and LPS aggregates. LUV systems composed of phosphatidylglycerol (POPG) and POPC:POPG mixtures have higher zeta-potential variations than POPC LUV. For LPS aggregates, rBPI 21 neutralizes the surface charge and at higher peptide concentrations overcompensates it. Results demonstrate that the interaction of the peptide rBPI 21 with LPS aggregates and LUV systems has electrostatic and hydrophobic contributions.",

Delepierre Unit\u00e9 de RMN des Biomol\u00e9cules CNRS URA 2185, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France Heme transport systems in bacteria are required and might be potential target for antibacterial drugs. The heme acquisition system, Has, exists in pathogenic as well as in opportunistic bacteria but only for the latter one extensive studies have been conducted, constituting as such a model system. The outer membrane receptor HasR, the central component of this system, functions in synergy with a secreted high affinity heme binding protein, the hemophore HasA. HasA extracts heme from host hemoproteins and returns it to HasR. Then, the energy given by a protein complex of the inner membrane is used to allow heme entrance across the bacterial membrane and to eject the empty hemophore from the receptor. Reconstitution of this heme acquisition system in E coli, overexpression and purification of its various components have allowed us to obtain sufficient amount of protein to perform NMR and biophysical studies to analyse at the molecular level the different steps of heme acquisition by HasR. Protein-protein interactions (PPI) are the central pillar supporting most of biological functional activity on the molecular level. A binding event between two proteins typically consists of two stages: 1) diffusional search of the binding partners for each other, and 2) specific recognition of the compatible binding surfaces followed by the formation of the complex. We focus here on the non-specific component of PPI, which refers to all physico-chemical properties of the binding partners (such as size, charge, isoelectric point, hydrophilicity etc.) that are independent of the exact details of their binding sites, but which could in turn affect their localization or diffusional search for one another. It is known that proteins co-localize due to segregation into different cellular compartments, sequestration via anchor and scaffold proteins or even chemical modifications. We suggest that the non-specific component of PPI determines in part the co-localization and clustering of the binding partners, which then directly in a non-specific fashion influences their interactions. We examine the possibility that such signature might be encoded within the experimental 3D structures of a large set of known mutually interacting proteins. We provide preliminary evidence that this indeed may be the case, and corroborate our findings by using different statistical tests to compare those features of the known interacting partners, and ascertain correlations and commonalities between them.",

Since conformational flexibility strongly depends on temperature, temperature dependent enzyme kinetic studies with measurements related to dynamics can give us some insight at atomic level into these functionally relevant motions. The catalytic efficiency (k cat /K M ) of 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase for its substrate (IPM) has unusual temperature dependence, showing a local minimum at 35 \u2022 C. In search of an explanation, we measured the individual constants k cat and K M,IPM as a function of temperature, and found that the van't Hoff plot of K M,IPM shows a sigmoid-like transition in the 20-40 \u2022 C temperature range. By means of various measurements including H-D exchange and FRET, we showed that the conformational fluctuations, including hinge-bending domain motions increase more steeply with temperature above 30 \u2022 C. The thermodynamic parameters of ligand binding determined by ITC as a function of temperature were found to be strongly correlated to the conformational fluctuations of the enzyme. Because the binding of IPM is associated with a hinge-bending domain closure, the more intense hinge-bending fluctuations at higher temperatures increasingly interfere with IPM binding, thereby abruptly increasing its dissociation constant and leading to the observed unusual temperature dependence of the catalytic efficiency.",

One of the potential targets of the autoimmune reaction is the myelin protein MOG that has been crystallized in complex with the 8-18C5 MS-autoantibody. The analysis of contacts and buried surface area combined with an alanine scanning computation reveals the key role of MOG fragment 101-108 for the interaction with 8-18C5. A docking simulation shows that the 101-108 fragment, excised from MOG, and kept in crystal-like conformation, is still capable of fitting into the binding pocket of the antibody. We then studied, through Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics simulations, the structural equilibrium distribution of the free peptide and of a number of analogs stabilized by a disulfide bond. We found that the free peptide yields a significant fraction of crystal-like conformations and the proportion of native-like structures is further increased by the disulfide bridge. When we tried to dock the centroids of the most populated clusters to 8-18C5, we discovered the existence of a docking funnel whose bottom is populated by stable complexes where the peptide occupies the same spatial region as in the crystal. We therefore conclude that the MOG 101-108 fragment may be used to develop a diagnostic assay or a drug for MS.",

Quenching of the Trp fluorescence after titration with a Trp-free Pf3 mutant indicates a change in the YidCs tertiary structure upon binding to its substrate.

The influence of different environments (lipid membranes, DDM micelles) on the secondary structure of YidC as well as on the YidC large periplasmic domain P1 was investigated by circular dichroism (CD).

Keskin Koc University, Istanbul, Turkey Histone proteins are fundamental to the cells since they are involved in cell regulatory processes, such as chromatin regulation, gene silencing and transcription, cell cycle control, and epigenetics, which are controlled via post-transcriptional modifications of the histone protein tails. These modifications are categorized under four main groups: methylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and phosphorylation. Among them methylation has been very recently proven to be reversible with the discovery of histone demethylase proteins and this modification type has been extensively studied, because the abnormal methylation rates cause the excess proliferation of the cell, which, in turn, triggers the cancer. Therefore, understanding of the details of reaction mechanisms of histone methylation/demethylation dynamics provide the required knowledge basis for preventing the abnormal methylation rates by designing proper inhibitor (drug) molecules. In this study, we display possible reaction mechanisms (such as amine oxidation via LSD1) for the demethylation of specific histone tail proteins. We try to explain the role/importance of residues that take place in or near to the reaction pocket for the demethylation reaction. We also carry out MD simulations and reaction path (free energy profile) analysis using Free Energy Perturbation (FEP) method for QM/MM hybrid systems in order to compare different possible reaction pathways. The Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signalling pathway plays an important role both in embryonic development and in adult stem cell function. Inappropriate regulation of this pathway is often due to dysfunction between two membrane receptors Patched (Ptc) and Smoothened (Smo) , which lead to birth defects, cancer or neurodegenerative diseases. However, little is known about Ptc, the receptor of the Shh protein, and the way Ptc regulates Smo, the receptor responsible for the transduction of the signal. To develop structure-function studies of these receptors, we expressed human Ptc (hPtc) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We demonstrated that hPtc expressed in a yeast membrane fraction is able to interact with its purified ligand Shh, indicating that hPtc is produced in yeast in its native conformational state. Using Surface Plasmon Resonance technology, we showed that fluorinated surfactants preserve the ability of hPtc to interact with its ligand after purification. This is the first report on the heterologous expression and the purification of a native and stable conformation of the human receptor Ptc. This work will allow the scale-up of hPtc production enabling its biochemical characterization, allowing the development of new therapeutic approaches against diseases induced by Shh signalling dysfunction.",

Laue Langevin, Grenoble, France, 3 ISIS, Rutherford Appleton Lab., Didcot, UK, 4 Oak Ridge National Lab., Centre for Structural Molecular Biology, Oak Ridge, USA Pore-forming colicin N hijacks E. coli outer membrane protein OmpF and exploits it as both a receptor and translocator to cross the outer membrane [1] . It is currently a matter of debate if the translocation route is through the OmpF lumen or the interface between OmpF and the lipid bilayer. Recent electron microscopy data from our laboratory suggests the latter route for translocation [2] . The colicin N/OmpF complex in detergent has been studied by SANS to examine the translocation pathway undertaken by colicin N. By using a combination of deuterated OmpF and hydrogenated colicin we have been able to derive a low resolution structure of individual proteins in the binary complex. Low resolution structural studies supplemented by targeted mutagenesis and screening techniques including ITC, potassium efflux assays and AUC have allowed us further our understanding of colicin N translocation. Dual-color Fluorescence Cross Correlation Spectroscopy (FCCS) has been used to explore the molecular dynamics at immune cell surfaces, with a particular focus towards the regulation mechanisms of natural killer (NK) lymphocytes. NK cells are critical mediators of anti-viral immunity and protectors against cancer spread. Their activity is governed by a fine-tuned balance between inhibitory and activating receptors, where Ly49A and KIR receptors represents the inhibitory ones. Their ligands are MHC class I receptors. FCS is a technique based on the analysis of intensity fluctuations of fluorescent molecules excited by a focused laser beam. The technique offers information about molecular dynamics at the single molecular level, in the nanosecond to millisecond range. Dual color FCCS expands FCS by correlating the intensity from two different colors. By labeling two potential interaction partners with dyes emitting at different wavelengths, the amount of interaction can be determined.",

Estrogen receptor (ER) is a well characterized member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that modulates the expression of estrogen-responsive target genes in response to estradiol and other natural and synthetic chemicals mimicking the estradiol structure. In human, two ERs, ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2, lied on two distinct chromosomes, are known. ER exhibits several functional domains: two conserved domains, a short domain C involved in DNA-binding and a large domain E/F responsible for ligand-binding and hormone-dependent transcription activation, are linked by a hinge domain D; a poorly conserved A/B domain, at the N terminus, mediating interactions with the general transcription machinery, is involved in hormone-independent transcription activation. Upon estrogen binding, ERs can specifically bind to a DNA fragment, called estrogen response element ERE, and activate the transcription. The optimal ERE sequence consists of two six base-pair half-sites, AGGTCA, organized as inverted repeats with a three base-pair spacing. In this study, we have investigated, by fluorescence methods, the effect of KCl concentrations, on the protein conformational flexibility and the thermodynamic stability of hERs -EREs complexes. We show, here, that electrostatic interactions, inside hERs, contribute to its conformational flexibility and its thermal stability. Moreover, the specific interaction between hERs and EREs is poorly sensitive to changes in ionic strength, in opposite to unspecific complexes.",

Septins are implicated in several cellular functions such as cytokinesis, vesicle trafficking, exocytosis, cytoeskeletal dynamics, cell polarity and sperm motility. Furthermore, they are associated with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. SEPT3 was identified in rat brain being highly enriched in presynaptic nerve terminals. It colocalizes with synaptophysin and dynamin I and is associated with synaptic vesicle. In this work, human SEPT3 without its N-terminal domain (SEPT3GC) was expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity and size exclusion cromatographies. Structural stability studies were performed with recombinant SEPT3GC using circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD), right-angle light scattering, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The SEPT3GC CD spectrum showed a conformational transition from a predominantly \u03b1-helical starting structure to one dominated by \u03b2-sheet, just above physiological temperatures. The formation of irreversible aggregates, detected by light scattering, and their ability to bind Thioflavin-T suggested that SEPT3 forms amyloidlike structures, as has been previously observed for human septins 2 and 4. Our data suggest that amyloid formation by isolated septins in vitro may be a general phenomenon whose physiological relevance needs to be further investigated. Pln149 is an antimicrobial peptide produced from Lactobacillus plantarum NRIC149. Analog Pln149 (Pln149a) and a Ser-derived (Pln149S, Tyr to Ser replacement) were synthesized on solid phase and their interactions with biomembrane model systems and inhibitory property on S.aureus and P.aeruginosa were investigated by CD, leakage assays, fluorescence spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. Both peptides share the same unordered structure-like CD spectrum in aqueous solution, but a helicoidal induction in the presence of negative vesicles were observed, however Pln149S showed lower helical content than Pln149a. The Ser-derived peptide presented 30% decrease of its leakage activity in different liposome compositions, a threefold increase in the dissociation constant from the liposomes than Pln149a, and close to 40% reduction for the inhibitory activity against P. aeruginosa growth. We can conclude that besides the electrostatic contacts between the amphipathic &alpha-helix, formed by the cationic residues from Pln149 and negatively charged phospholipids, the Pln149-membrane binding is a process driven for the hydrophobic interactions from non-polar residues. In this case, there was a significant contribution of the Tyr residue, which must be allocated in a lipid interface, described as the preferential position to this residue in membrane proteins.

It offers simple, low-cost and fast method for sensitive detection of important biological analytes without modification. In this contribution we present a deep UV fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy system (DUV-FLIM) based on a picosecond deep UV laser using time-correlated single-photon counting method. The described setup is well-suited for biological applications for ultrasensitive detection. We have showed single UV dye (BMQ) and single protein (Ec\u03b2 Gal ) molecules detection using DUV-FLIM. Further, the label free detection of protein interaction between Ec\u03b2 Gal and monoclonal anti-Ec\u03b2 Gal has been demonstrated by means of steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. We achieved detection sensitivity for the Ec\u03b2 Gal/ anti-Ec\u03b2 Gal pair down to the nanomolar concentration range. We also extended this method to study the interaction of therapeutic drug porphyrin with BSA protein. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer between protein and Alexa Fluor 350 has been investigated using DUV-FLIM. The intrinsic fluorescence and fluorescence lifetime changes of donor biotin \u03b2-Galactosidase have been measured. Energy transfer efficiency and donor acceptor distance have been obtained. Fluorescence images of acceptor AF 350 due to FRET have been observed when excited at 266 nm. The monomeric heme-containing indoleamine 2,3dioxygenase (IDO) catalyses the oxidative cleavage of the indole moiety of L-tryptophan (L-Trp). Enhanced L-Trp degradation contributes to various physiological disorders including depression or failure of the immuno-regulating system. The regulation of IDO by inhibitors is extensively studied. However, the catalytic mechanism of IDO on the molecular level is still unknown. In addition to L-Trp, a wide range of substrates are degraded including D-tryptophan, melatonine or tryptamine. In contrast, indole or histidine do not function as substrates for IDO. To understand the determinants for substrate specificity, we investigate the interaction of the heme iron, the heme-bound ligand and the substrate. We use (time-resolved) UV/visible and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy over a wide temperature range (4 -300 K) to monitor the binding of diatomic ligands to the heme iron and the binding of different substrates to COligated IDO. Changes in the spectra upon addition of L-Trp are analyzed and compared to those induced by other substrates or inhibitors.",

Access of O 2 , CO, and NO to the heme is granted by protoglobin-specific apolar tunnels reaching the heme distal site from locations at the B/G and B/E helix interfaces. Here we report structural and kinetic data on Pgb mutants engineered to probe the protein structural and kinetic properties. Six crystal structures (Pgb mutants: \u220620 (missing 20 Nter residues), Y(B10)61\u2192A, Y(B10)61\u2192W, F(B12)63\u2192W, F(G7)145\u2192W, I(G11)149\u2192F) show that the mutations engineered essentially restrict access to ligand tunnel 1. An accurate molecular level description of the signaling mechanism in Ca 2+ transducers necessitates the knowledge of the kinetics and energetics of conformational changes associated with Ca 2+ binding to various calcium binding proteins.

This approach allows us to monitor time profiles of volume and enthalpy changes on the microsecond to millisecond timescale. The initial PBD study of Ca 2+ photo-relase from Ca 2+ loaded DM-nitrophen reveals the presence of two phases. The first step takes place within first 20 \u00b5s upon and is associated with a volume decrease of -7 mL mol \u22121 and enthalpy change of 66 kcal mol \u22121 . On the longer timescale (\u03c4 = 200 \u00b5s), the second event with a positive volume change of 7 mL mol \u22121 and enthalpy change of 8 kcal mol \u22121 was detected. On the other hand, Ca 2+ photorelease in the presence of calmodulin is accompanied with an additional phase with a distinct lifetime and volume and enthalpy changes that reflects the metal binding to calmodulin and concomitant structural changes.",

We focus on the assessment of peptide accumulation on bacterial membranes as an example of this separation: AMP-bilayer interactions have been subject to extensive biophysical characterization, but conversion of that information into educated estimates of in vivo membrane-bound AMP concentrations is lacking. This has led to the overlooking of important factors for activity.

In this project we analyze the fusion of active conformation of the envelope gp41 from the human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIV). During the infection process gp41 undergoes a sequence of conformational changes where the N -terminal NHR develop a trimer pre-hairpin intermediate. Afterwards the three CHR fold back towards the central NHR and a six helix bundle is formed. This rearrangement forces the viral and the host membrane into close contact and fusion pores may induce membrane fusion. This decisive molecular step in retroviral fusion has been modeled by rational design of lipopeptide assemblies that mimic a coiled-coil structure serving as a receptor for potential antagonists. For this purpose, SSLBs were functionalized in an in situ coupling reaction with peptides originating from the NHR (N-peptides) of SIV and HIV to monitor the interactions with the specific CHR peptides (C34 and T20). Binding of antagonists to surface confined coiled-coil structures has been quantified by ellipsometry, quartz crystal microbalance and was visualized by atomic force microscopy.",

Docking simulations can be seriously hampered by the great difficulty to accurately estimate the ligand-protein binding affinity constant K, which is usually derived via the computation of the binding free energy \u2206G. Unfortunately, due to the involved logarithmic relationship, errors of less than 1.5 kcal/mol in the computation of \u2206G result in about one order of magnitude inaccuracy on K. This can hinder computational methods from discriminating micromolar from nanomolar compounds. To improve the reliability of docking prediction, we make use of enhanced sampling methods, ranging from steered molecular dynamics 1 to metadynamics 2 . We also test several descriptors, such as the recently developed path collective variables 3 , to identify the most suitable reaction coordinates accounting for binding and unbinding processes. Using these approaches we investigate ligand docking and undocking and we attempt to describe at an atomistic level the kinetics of binding, which we intend to exploit for drug design purposes. Here, an example of application in drug design is reported. 1. Isralewitz, B. et al.; J. Mol. Graph. Model. 2001, 19 , 13-25. 2. Laio, A. and Parrinello, M.; PNAS 2002, 99 , 12562-6. 3.

Solernou, Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Jordi Girona 29, Barcelona, Spain Protein-protein interactions are essential in the majority of life processes, so they have keen interest in several knowledge areas. However, experimental data on protein complexes is being produced at a quite low pace in comparison to that of the individual components. Thus, in recent years attention has focused into computational approaches to the proteinprotein docking problem. A variety of docking protocols have been recently reported, sharing usually the following strategy: fast rigid-body search of the interacting subunits, followed by scoring and refinement of the interfaces. Although this kind of strategy has proven some good results in the CAPRI blind test it has two main limitations. On one hand one should include full flexibility on the protein structures. On the other, the evaluation should be made with free energy calculations instead of using a scoring function. In this work we propose to search the native complex structure in the minimum of the free energy landscape. We use the coarse grained potential UNRES to get the potential energy of the possible conformations. They are generated changing the dihedral angles, the side chain rotamers, and lastly the mutual orientation using a new sampling protocol we have developed (Rotation-Based Uniform Sampling; RotBUS). Finally, the free energy calculations are performed using an OMP parallelization of the Wang-Landau algorithm.",

In this project, our group focuses on molecular dynamic simulations of HtpG, an E. Coli homolog of the human Hsp90 (heat shock protein 90kDa). The full structure of HtpG was published by Shiau et al. in 2006, but the mechanism of how HtpG performs its function is still not understood. The folding mechanism is an ATP driven reaction cycle, in which the functional entity is a homodimer of HtpG. We separate the cycle in three main states: apo, ADP-and ATPbound state. Conventional molecular dynamics simulations are used to build a stable simulation system and provide structure trajectories and primary information about the behavior of HtpG in its different states of the folding process. Experiments indicate that the molecular movement is ATP driven. We use force distribution analysis to elucidate how ATP effects HtpG conformation and dynamics. The small size of Myoglobin makes it the preferred candidate to investigate the structure-function paradigm. In its interior five docking sites have been identified and for long time these Xenon cavities have been classified as packing defects. Recently, it was shown that they might be involved in ligands migration path. However, some questions regarding its role as oxygen carrier NO scavenger remain yet open as well as the microscopic mechanism regulating these biological functions. In this work we made use of standard MD simulations of solvated myoglobin to characterize internal cavities. Our principal results is that we have found several secondary cavities showing volume and occurrence at least comparable to that of Xenon cavities. In order to analyze and rationalize internal cavities we applied special cluster-analysis: we classified all cavities with respect to the position, size and occurrence ascribing them to different clusters. This analysis highlights possible intrinsic migration paths for small ligands within the protein matrix controlled by spontaneous fluctuations of the protein itself. Moreover, we identified some key residues playing a fundamental role in controlling internal pathways. Our suggestion that the secondary cavities constitute the preferred path for ligand escape is also supported by explicit metadynamics simulations of ligand escape.",

PGK is a key enzyme in glycolysis; it catalyses the reversible reaction 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate + ADP \u2194 3-phosphoglycerate + ATP. Here we explored the catalytic role in human PGK of the highly conserved Lys 215 that has been proposed to be essential for PGK function, by a transient and equilibrium kinetic study with the active site mutant K215A. By the stopped-flow method we show that the kinetics of substrate binding and the associated protein isomerization steps are fast and identical for the wild-type PGK and mutant K215A. By the use of a chemical sampling method (rapid-quench-flow) under multi and single turnover conditions and in both directions of the reaction, we show that the rate-limiting step with wild type PGK follows product formation, whereas with the mutant it is the phospho-transfer step itself that is rate limiting. These data are supported by SAXS measurements which showed no direct role of Lys 215 in the domain closure of the enzyme i.e. the isomerisation step of the reaction.

It has been shown that the interaction of NRP1with heparin/heparan sulfate is implicated in its enhancement of growth factor signalling, however the mechanism is not yet known. Commercially available extracellular domain of NRP1 is available either as a truncated HIS-tagged human protein (hNRP1) or as the rat protein fused to HIStagged human Fc and expressed as a dimer (FcrNRP1). Biochemical properties such as kinetics of heparin binding and structural requirements for sugar binding together with biochemical tests of protein properties were performed in order to characterise these commercial proteins. Fc rNRP1 shown high affinity to heparin (Kd=2.5 nM) and required a minimum of dp10 to effectively compete with Fc rNRP1 binding to immobilised heparin. Competition experiments with various modified sugars show that interaction of Fc rNRP1 with heparin is highly ionic and dependent on the position of sulfate groups along the heparin chain. The hNRP1 did not bind to heparin immobilised via NHS-biotin, though it did bind to some heparin affinity chromatography matrices. Organic compounds of tin are among wide spread environmental pollutants. Due to physical and/or chemical actions, poly-substituted alkyltins speciate into less substituted, more toxic species. Tetra-or tri-alkyltins show a marked delay in their toxic action with respect to the corresponding di-and mono-alkylated analogs. It has been hypothesized that the delayed toxicity may results from the progressive dealkylation of alkyltins in more toxic di-and mono-derivatives, which bind and inhibit essential enzymes. It has been proposed that alkyltins preferentially target enzyme sulphydryl groups. Previously, we showed that a nine amino acid linear peptide (I 1 LGCWCYLR 9 ) containing a CXC motif is able to bind and dealkylate tri-substituted alkyltin compounds into the corresponding dialkyl derivatives. Here, we investigated the time dependence of the degradation of the most common alkyltin derivatives by this peptide. We monitored the reaction kinetics using the intrinsic fluorescence of the tryptophan residue in position 5 of the peptide. We found that all of the alkyltins analyzed are progressively degraded to dialkyl derivatives, following a pseudo-enzymatic reaction mechanism. The end-point of the reactions was the formation of a covalent complex between the disubstituted alkyltin and the peptide. These data agree with the speciation profiles proposed for polysubstituted alkyltins in the environment and reveal a possible biotic degradation pathway for these toxic compounds. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative condition characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and by the presence of intracellular inclusions, composed predominantly of fibrillar alpha-synuclein (aS). Post-mortem studies indicate the presence of oxidative damage in the nigral neurons. Dopamine oxidation, which leads to the formation of highly reactive quinones (DAQ), may account for the specificity neurodegeneration observed in PD. DAQ have many potential protein targets for chemical modifications. Among them, we focused our attention on DJ-1, of which mutated forms have been found in familial cases of PD. A possible function of DJ-1 is its redox-dependent chaperone activity that could prevent aS aggregation and fibril formation. In the present work, we analyzed the structural and functional modification induced on DJ-1 by DAQ. 15 N-HSQC spectra of DJ-1 were recorded in the presence of different amounts of DAQ and chemical shift perturbations were used to identify the DJ-1 residues target of DAQ and their relative reactivity toward DAQ. Aggregation assays were also performed to evaluate the functional effects of the DAQ modifications on the chaperone activity of DJ-1. Rabies Virus (RABV) infects neurons exclusively and causes lethal encephalitis. Pathogenic RABV strains favor neuronal survival, whereas non-pathogen strains lead to neuronal apoptosis. The use of recombinant RABV showed: 1/ the G protein determined the induction of the survival or death phenotypes; 2/ the last 4 COOH amino acids of the G protein cytoplasmic domain (CytoG) are critical. These residues form a binding site for PDZ domain (PDZ-BS). One of the 6 amino acid differences between survival and death Gproteins are located in this PDZ-BS. Results of two-hybrid experiments showed that CytoG survival interacted PDZ domain of Ser/Thr kinases (MAST), while CytoG death interacted also with 3 additional PDZ containing host proteins. To understand the fine structural basis for the specificity of the PDZ-CytoG complexes, we determined the 3D structure and the dynamics of the MAST-CytoG complexes by NMR. The structures, as well as the affinities and constant kinetics, of the MAST2 PDZ complexes with both CytoG are similar. We conclude that difference by one aa in the PDZ-BS of the two strains cannot drastically modify the interaction with MAST2-PDZ, in agreement with the two-hybrid data. Preliminary results suggest that the interaction of CytoG death with one additional cellular partner blurs the pro-survival signals engaging the infected cells through apoptotic trails.",

In this approach the 4'phosphopantetheinyl group of coenzyme A (CoA) was transferred to the acyl carrier protein-derived YbbR tag of the target protein by means of the phosphopantetheinyl transferase Sfp. The glass-support was rendered biocompatible by coating it with an ultrathin layer of PEG (polyethylene glycol), followed by functionalization with CoA through maleimide chemistry. Immobilization of YbbR-tagged proteins in presence of Sfp was followed in real time by label-free detection using reflectance interference spectroscopy. The immobilization procedure was thus systematically optimized by means of binding specificity, enzyme activity and functionality of the immobilized protein. This approach was employed for immobilizing the type I interferon IFN\u03b12 in order to probe ligand recognition by ifnar1 and ifnar2 and ligand-induced ternary complex formation. The versatility of this technique was further enhanced by its combination with photopatterning methods.

One family of iGluRs, the kainate receptors, show unusual sensitivity to changes in external ion species resulting in an apparent requirement for both sodium and chloride ions for activation. Our recent work revealed the location and selectivity of the cation binding sites. Despite this progress, it is still unclear how the cation binding sites confer sodium selectivity and how apparent affinity for chloride is influenced by the presence of cations. We have attempted to address these questions by performing extensive free energy calculations using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. The rank order of cation binding obtained from relative binding free energy calculations is in agreement with experimental measurements of apparent affinity. These calculations also reveal that the pair of cation binding sites in the dimer interface act independently. Binding free energy calculations performed using a reduced model of the binding site show that cation selectivity can been attributed to both the rigidity and high charge density of the binding sites. Finally, a potential of mean force derived from umbrella sampling simulations indicate that the presence of cations stabilize the anion binding site considerably.",

The rate constant of the release is 0,006 s \u22121 , which is a slower process than the hydrolysis itself (0,02 s \u22121 ).Phalloidin, a cyclic peptide from Amanita phalloides can bind to the filaments and stabilizes their structure. Jasplakinolide is another cyclic peptide from marine sponge (Jaspis johnstoni) which binds actin filaments. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the binding of toxins to the newly created filaments has an effect on the kinetics of the inorganic phosphate release or not. We used absorption photometry measurements to measure the rate of phosphate release. Phalloidin decreased the rate of the release substantially. Although the effect of Jasplakinolide was weaker, the results showed that the binding of these toxins to the actin can modify the rate of the release of inorganic phosphate from the filaments. These observations are in agreement with the molecular mechanisms by which these toxins stabilise the actin filamens. Fluorescent proteins (FPs) are invaluable fluorescent markers in cell biology. However, their use is often limited by photobleaching of the chromophore, notably in single-molecule, time-resolved or super-resolution imaging studies. We will present the crystallographic studies at near atomic resolution of a photo-activatable fluorescent protein IrisFP that has been observed in a transient radical state en route to photobleaching. We took advantage of X-rays to populate the radical, which, under illumination with visible light, presumably forms with low probability from the triplet state. The combined X-ray diffraction and in crystallo spectroscopic data (from UV-Vis and Raman spectroscopies) reveal that radical formation in IrisFP involves strong but reversible distortion of the chromophore, suggesting a transient loss of pi-conjugation. These results will help unravel the mechanisms of blinking and photobleaching in FPs, which is of importance to rationally design variants of higher photostability.",

            "text": "In the present work a highly specific, genetically encoded sensor is developed for detecting simultaneously intracellular pH and chloride concentration. The sensor is obtained by fusion of a red fluorescent protein (DsRed-monomer), insensitive to chloride and pH, to a GFP variant containing a specific chloride-binding site (GFP-Chl). DsRed-GFP-Chl binds the chloride ion following a fluorescence static quenching mechanism, which allows measurements of intracellular pH in a chlorideindependent manner. The sensor has been successfully tested in different living cells, in a pH range 5-8 and chloride concentration up to 200 mM. For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, it allowed to measure the chloride concentration of dense core vesicles in the secretory pathway. Applicability to high-throughput screening, range of validity and accuracy of time-lapse maps will be discussed. We aim to understand the basis of the photophysical changes in fluorescent proteins (FP) induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Indeed, ROS might be involved in photochemistry of FP, leading to their photobleaching or photoconversion. In addition, FP may be used to investigate cellular events like phagocytosis or mitochondrial activity, where ROS are naturally produced. In the latter cases, an accurate analysis of FP's fluorescence signals requires the full knowledge of reactions between ROS and FP. In the future, this work may help in developing either photoresistant or photoswitchable FP and improving their use for imaging under oxidative stress conditions. Using \u03b3-radiolysis as a quantitative source of ROS, we investigated the reactions of OH and O 2 \u2212 radicals on the Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP) and the modifications of the CFP's photophysical properties by OH radicals were explored in detail (submitted). In order to address the corresponding chemical changes in the protein, we devised a mild proteolysis protocol that for the first time offers a peptide mass fingerprint almost covering the CFP sequence (Alvarez et al. Biochemistry 2009). Then, we achieved the meticulous characterization of the CFP oxidation products by mass spectrometry and proposed a mechanism to account for their formation by pulse radiolysis. Since the cloning of the green fluorescent protein from Aequoria victoria, numerous screens have been performed to improve the brightness of this protein, its spectral variants and fluorescent proteins from other species. The improvement is evaluated by comparing fluorescence intensity of individual bacteria or colonies. In this way also expression level, folding and maturation efficiency, and thickness of the bacterial colony contribute. Here we report a screening method that, in addition to fluorescence intensity, quantifies the excited state lifetime of a fluorescent protein, which is independent of intensity or expression level, and provides a direct measure for the quantum efficiency of the fluorescent protein. The novel approach was used to screen a library of cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) variants randomly mutated at position 65, 148 and 224, yielding an improved bright cyan fluorescent protein named, mPoseidon, with a markedly increased fluorescence lifetime and quantum yield, increased photostability and improved fluorescence intensity in vivo. It is shown that mPoseidon is the brightest Cyan Fluorescent Protein in mammalian cells. In addition, several lifetime variants were identified that can be used for lifetime unmixing. It is demonstrated that three CFP variants can be separated and their distribution quantified in a single detection channel.",

Like other Photo Activatable Fluorescence Proteins (PAFP), it exhibits photo-switching properties. However, the mechanism by which fluorescence can be swiched on or off upon light irradiation is not fully understood at the molecular level. The bright to dark conversion involves a protonation step and structural rearrangements of the chromophore, but it is not clear which of these two steps is the triggering event. To answer this question, we carried out photo-switching experiments at cryotemperatures. Our data suggest that a photo-induced protonation step (probably in the triplet state) is the primary event in the bright to dark conversion. Our results may bear relevance to other PAFPs, such as Iris, Eos, Dronpa, Padron or Kaede. How misfolding and aggregation of proteins constitutes a toxic insult to neurons remains largely unknown. In order to obtain insight into the molecular biology of neurodegenerative disease, we have developed a number of GFP-based biosensors for the detection and quantification of cellular clearing mechanisms for aggregated proteins. The high load on these protein quality control mechanisms, and their failure to meet normal physiological demand ultimately results in a \"de-compensation\" condition from which the nerve cell cannot recover. Our FRET/FLIM-based bioassays visualize protein ubiquitination and degradation; proteasomal activity; foldase activity using a folding-impaired GFP mutant which gains fluorescence conditional on the upregulation of chaperone activity; chaperone binding to unfolded proteins; and autophagosome formation/lysosomal integrity via the targeted and sensitive FRET-based measurement of pH changes. These sensors are employed in cellular model systems for Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) to delineate the molecular pathway of cellular demise, and to gain a mechanistic understanding of the toxicity of protein aggregates and the basis for the vulnerability of neurons.",

Chirico 1 1 Dipartimento di Fisica, Universit\u00e0 di Milano Bicocca, Italy, 2 Dipartimento di Biochimica e Biologia Molecolare, Universit\u00e0 di Parma, Parma, Italy E222Q mutants of the Green Fluorescent Protein are known to possess photo-chromic properties: the anionic emission, primed by a pump 488 nm laser beam, can be switched between two levels of different brightness by irradiation with a blue, \u223c = 400 nm, probe laser light. We have studied here the amplitude and the dynamics of the brightness enhancement of the E222Q mutant of GFPMut2. The fluorescence emission increases almost threefold, under saturating probe laser excitation, for pump excitation intensity in the linear regime. Two characteristic activation times, estimated by means of modulated two colour fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, are detected in the 1-30 ms range, independent of solution temperature and viscosity. The brightness enhancement factor and the characteristic activation times depend markedly on the solution pH. These results indicate that this mutant can be used as a high sensitive intracellular marker for local proton concentration and for modulated excitation imaging. The advent of fluorescent proteins (FP) gave researchers the opportunity to study proteins in situ. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) benefited from this. Cell fixation is a commonly used approach when working with microscopy. However, we have found that FRET efficiency (E) in cells transfected with Cerulean and Venus chimeras could not be reproducibly measured after fixation. To evaluate this problem in detail, we measured E of 3 Cerulean-Venus standard constructs by acceptor photobleaching FRET, intensity-based ratiometric FRET and FLIM-FRET. The constructs were produced as standards (Biophys J, 2006, 91, 99) with 43, 38 and 31% E values, comprising donor-acceptor separations of 5, 17 and 32 amino acids, respectively. Transient transfection of the fusion plasmids was performed into HeLa cells and E was measured in live and PFA or methanol fixed cells. Literature E values were reproduced when measuring live cells. Conversely, cell fixation caused a deviation of E values. Methanol fixed cells showed E between 1-5% for all the constructs. The effect of PFA fixation on both fluorescence intensity and FRET varied vastly among independent experiments regardless of the measurement modality. Thus, fixation should be avoided due to the effects it has on FP's fluorescence and consequently on FRET efficiency. To explain the improvement in the fluorescence properties of Cerulean when compared to ECFP, we have determined the X-ray crystallographic structures of these two proteins at physiological pH, and performed molecular dynamics simulations. Both proteins exhibit a structural heterogeneity in the Nterminal half of their seventh strand, which forms a specific set of van der Waals interactions with the chromophore. The critical H148D mutation present in Cerulean induces a modification of these interactions, and allows the chromophore to be more planar and better packed, albeit only intermittently. As a consequence, the probability of non-radiative decay is significantly decreased. Our results highlight the considerable dynamical flexibility that exists in the vicinity of the tryptophan-based chromophore of these engineered fluorescent proteins, and provide insights which should allow the design of mutants with enhanced optical properties.",

Jung Biophysical Chemistry, Saarland University, 66123 Saarbruecken, Germany Biotechnological design of the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) and the discovery of other proteins boosted the development of the life sciences in the past decade. Tracking protein movements and high resolution microscopy are only a few recent applications which were realized by fluorescent protein technology. Among these examples, the switching between two chromophore state is exploited. Our aim is to establish fluorescent proteins for bioanalytical fluorescence lifetime measurements. Despite the progress in other fields, quantification with GFP still imposes practical problems [1] . In the past, we observed that the UV-light driven decarboxylation of the nearby aminoacids Glu222 distorts the fluorescence lifetime of GFP [2] . We found out that this chemical reaction also occurs under excitation of the anionic chromophore state with a high quantum yield [3] . Recently, we could show by time-resolved spectroscopy that, indeed, the more susceptible state for this kind of photoconversion is the anionic chromophore state [4] . Suppression of this reaction therefore enables the design of autofluorescent proteins which can be used e.g. for the quantification of ions and which are beneficial as donors in FRET applications. The fluorescent properties of tryptophan residues (W) in proteins are highly dependent on their immediate protein environment. However, the multi exponential decay of single W proteins is not completely understood. The most cited hypothesis contributes a multi exponential decay to the existence of several micro conformations (rotamers) of the W residue within the protein matrix. To determine rotamers we apply a method based on Dead-end elimination (DEE) and molecular dynamics simulations (MD). Low energy rotamers are calculated by DEE while dynamics and further refinement is accomplished using MD. The method was applied on several test cases including the protein mutant Bc-Csp L66E from Bacillus caldolyticus, which contains a solvent exposed W residue. As resolved by X-ray crystallography, this W residue occupies two conformations. Using DEE and MD we were able to retrieve the W conformations found in the X-ray structure. The results demonstrate the ability of the method to obtain valuable W rotamers, both for solvent shielded as exposed residues. The determined conformations were compatible with the findings based on a method using replica exchange simulations.",

By using X-ray crystallography, we determined the structures of the dimeric variants d1eqFP611 and d2eqFP611 at high resolution (up to 1.1\u00c5). For d1eqFP611, we had previously seen a redshifted species upon irradiation with 532-nm light. Concomitant changes in the Raman spectrum were interpreted as evidence of a trans-cis isomerization of the chromophore. Here we have combined X-ray crystallography and site-directed mutagenesis to assess whether we can create a stable fluorescent, red-shifted eqFP611 variant with a cis chromophore. In a first step, we introduced the N143S substitution. This variant, d2RFP630, is highly fluorescent, with the absorption (emission) maximum red-shifted by 24 (19) nm. With an additional S158C mutation, the chromophore is found completely in the cis form. The variant, RFP639, is highly fluorescent, with excitation and emission maxima at 588 and 639 nm.

This process occurs in the neutral state of the chromophore and is known to result from backbone cleavage accompanied by an extension of the delocalized \u03c0-electron system. We have measured the X-ray structure of green Dendra2 and performed a comprehensive characterization of the optical absorption and fluorescence properties of the protein in both its green and red forms. The structure, which is very similar to those reported for the closely related proteins EosFP and Kaede, revealed a local structural change next to the chromophore, involving mainly Arg66 and a water molecule. We propose that this structural change explains the blue shift of the absorption and emission bands, as well as the markedly higher pKs of the hydroxyphenyl moiety of the chromophore. The 20-fold enhancement of the neutral species in Dendra2 at physiological pH accounts for the observed higher photoconversion yield of this protein in comparison to EosFP.",

The variation of spectral properties before and after photoconversion of chemically-synthesized isolated chromophores under different protonation and/or isomerization have been analyzed, and compared to results obtained for the case of complete folded proteins comprising the same chromophores. Experimental results have been analyzed within a time-dependent density functional theory, allowing us to assign all relevant vibrational modes. These results make it possible to discriminate between the effect of cis-trans isomerization and of diverse protonation states of the chromophore in the photoproducts of these proteins. S.

Ci\u00eancias, Universidade do Porto, Portugal Gram-negative bacteria characteristically are protected by an outer membrane that serves as a selective permeation barrier. Most of the \u03b2-lactam antibiotics appear to penetrate the outer membrane through these non-specific channels, and it becomes important to understand the possible interactions between \u03b2-lactams and the porin. Fluorescence techniques have been largely used to characterize both the conformation and the dynamic behavior of large biological structures such as membranes and proteins. The fluorescence of the tryptophan residues is quenched in the presence of the different cephalosporin antibiotics. This reaction between the excited state of the fluorophores and the drug can be described as a formation of a non-fluorescent complex. The dependence of the fluorescence intensity upon quencher concentration for static quenching is proportional to the binding constant for complex formation. Since \u03b2-lactam susceptibility is closely related to the presence of these non-specific porins, Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) by micro-broth dilution in microplate were used to assess the bactericidal activity of cephalosporin antibiotics upon on Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3 ) and a series of BL21(DE3) mutated in different outer membrane proteins. This combined study of the interactions at single molecular level and at in vivo level provides new insights for a better understanding of the antibiotic translocation. When used in combination with e.g. a cyan fluorescent protein, Keima offers the unique opportunity to perform dual color fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy using a single laser line to excite both fluorophores. The molecular determinants of the large Stokes shift of mKeima have been characterized structurally by combining X-ray crystallography with in crystallo UV-visible absorption, fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy. Our results reveal a pH-dependant \"reverse chromophore protonation\" of mKeima, driven by the key residue Asp157. Moreover, the chromophore protonation state is shown to be coupled with different chromophore conformations, cis conformation at pH 3.8, and mostly trans conformation at pH 8.0. These results will help unravel the mechanisms of fluorescence in FPs, which is of importance to rationally design and develop new fluorescent markers. Recently reversibly switchable fluorescent proteins (RSFPs) have become a new branch of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) like family. The RSFPs may be reversibly switched between a fluorescent and a non-fluorescent state by irradiation with light of distinct wavelengths. The key process of this switching behaviour is a light induced change of the chromophore between a cis-and a trans-isomeric state. The proteins are becoming increasingly important for diverse applications like protein tracking, sub-diffraction resolution microscopy and data storage. Based on the switching mechanism, we created novel RSFPs with unique and improved characteristics. Padron and bs-Dronpa are two of these new switchable proteins. Padron features a reversed switching mechanism as compared to all other green RSFPs known to date while bsDronpa exhibits a very broad absorption spectrum extending into the UV. Utilizing the characteristics of both proteins, we performed multi label single detection colour microscopy as well as dual colour sub-diffraction microscopy, the latter with a resolution of 20 nm. Further, we recently introduced the first monomeric RSFP exhibiting red fluorescence: Using a semi rational mutagenesis approach on the non-switchable mCherry, we generated the switchable monomeric protein rsCherryRev. The use of this protein in single molecule switching microscopy allowed us to record time-lapse live-cell images of the endoplasmic reticulum with sub-diffraction resolution.",

Henriksen Technical University of Denmark, DTU Nanotech, Frederiksborgvej 399, B124, 4000 Roskilde, Denmark. Email: Thomas.andresen@nanotech.dtu.dk. Research in the partitioning of peptides into lipid membranes has been intense for several years. Along with scattering techniques and NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) has proven to be a powerful tool for thermodynamic characterization of peptide-membrane interactions. We have studied two antimicrobial peptides, mastoparan-X and melittin, and found that these peptides induce a range of structural transitions of POPC and POPC/POPG membrane systems at different peptide-lipid ratios. We have found that ITC can be used to elucidate the threshold where transitions occur, including the threshold for pore formation and micellation. This has been achieved using a thermodynamic model based on Gouy-Chapman theory, which provides the partitioning constant of the peptide-membrane interaction and thereby the concentration of peptide on the membrane surface. The structural changes have furthermore been visualized by cryo-TEM. We have further investigated the pore formation in detail and found that the thermodynamic parameters of pore formation can be fully characterized using a system specific temperature where the enthalpy of peptide partitioning becomes zero. This allows for an exclusive study of the pore formation process. Lactoferrin is a glycoprotein with two globular lobes, with of two domains each. Since its discovery, the research on antimicrobial properties has been extended to peptides derived from this protein. The largest family studied so far is known as lactoferricin B, obtained from the protein by digestion with pepsin. More recently, a new family of antimicrobial peptides derived from Lactoferrin was discovered by Bolcher et al and named Lactoferrampin (LFampin). The original sequence of LFampin contained residues 268-284 from the N1 domain of Lactoferrin. We studied 3 peptides derived from LFampin obtained by extension and/or truncation at the C-or N-terminal sides, keeping the essential characteristics, in order to unravel the main structural features responsible for antimicrobial action. The peptides were tested against model membranes. The ability to adopt helical conformation was followed by CD, the perturbation of the membrane phase transition by DSC, the energetics of interaction by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC), the partition of the peptide to the membrane by TRFS and the importance of charge effects assessed by Zeta Potential measurements. The results are discussed and compared to the antimicrobial and hemolytic activities obtained by Microbiology techniques. Defensins are small cysteine-rich cationic proteins or peptides found in both vertebrates and invertebrates. They can be active against bacteria, fungi and many enveloped and non-enveloped viruses; thus, being also classified as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). In the present work a comparative study between Psd1 (a plant defensin with antifungic properties obtained from the garden pea Pisum sativum) and Hnp1 (a human neutrophils defensin) was conducted, in order to shed some light on the mechanism of action at the molecular level of these defensins. Large unillamelar vesicles with different lipid compositions were used for this purpose as biomembranes model systems; namely, POPC/cholesterol (characteristic of the outer leaflet of vertebrates cell membranes) and POPC/ergosterol (fungal) mixtures. Changes on the intrinsic fluorescence of the tryptophan residues present in these peptides upon membrane binding/insertion were followed by fluorescence spectroscopy. Experimental results show the affinity of both defensins for mammalian and fungal sterols. The partitioning behavior of Psd1 showed a high selectivity for ergosterol rich membranes, while Hnp1 has preference for cholesterol rich membranes.",

Biophysics, Yerevan State University, Armenia Studies on the interaction of snake venom and organized lipid interfaces have been conducted using a variety of systems, including bilayer lipid membranes (BLMs), small and large unilamellar vesicles. Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) with a mean diameter of 30 \u00b5m have a minimum curvature and mimic cell membranes in this respect. GUVs are ideal for studying lipid/lipid and lipid/protein interactions using microscopy techniques with membrane fluorescence probes. GUVs were formed from the total lipid fraction from bovine brain by the electroformation method, developed by Angelova and Dimitrov (1987) . Vipera lebetina obtusa venom was added to the sample chamber before the vesicles were formed. The membrane fluorescence probes, ANS and pyrene, were used to assess the state of the membrane and specifically mark the phospholipid domains. ANS and pyrene allows us to quantify the fluidity changes in the membrane by measuring of the fluorescence intensity. The presence of viper venom in GUVs media reveals a noticable decreasing of membrane fluidity compare the control, while the binding of fluorophores with GUVs modified by venom lead to appearance of channel activity. It was recognized early that the vipers' venom components preferred an organized lipid substrate near the lipid's phase transition and were particularly active against micellar lipids. These studies also emphasize the importance of a membrane surface curvature for its interaction with enzymatic components of venom. The attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy is ideal for highly absorbing samples such as water suspensions or even bulk water due to the small light penetration depth. It is also suited for experiments on lipid membranes in excess water. For example, we have studied the hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) between cholesterol (CH) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) or sphingomyelin (SM), which could be important for the stabilization of the cholesterol-rich lipid domains. The ATR-FTIR method enabled comparison of the carbonyl band shape for PC/CH samples in excess H 2 O or D 2 O, and has confirmed similar behavior for both [1] . Secondly, we were able to analyze the amide II band for SM/CH samples in excess H 2 O. The observations confirm the presence of H-bonds between CH and N-H group in SM [2] . Another example is the study of the interlamellar water structure, which could influence the water-mediated phenomena in membranes. H-bonds in interlamellar water in partially hydrated lipid multibilayers are stronger with respect to bulk water. In contrast, we show by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy that the H-bonds are weaker in multibilayers in excess water [3] . The bactericidal activity of antimicrobial peptides is linked to their ability to perturb the permeability of bacterial cells. They often show \u03b1-helical conformation, and many peptides have a kink in the middle of this structure, caused by Pro or Gly. In order to understand the role of the kink we designed various analogues of P5, in which the central Pro residue was moved from its central position, or removed altogether (in analogue P5F). Displacement of the Pro residue caused a decrease of the antimicrobial activity, and an increase in the toxicity against erythrocytes, with the less active and more toxic peptide being P5F. Fluorescence studies suggest that both P5 and P5F bind on the membrane surface. Fluorescence experiments show that the activities of the two analogues correlate with their affinity for different kinds of lipid bilayers: the kinked P5 peptide has a dramatically higher affinity for negatively charged vesicles (mimicking the composition of bacterial membranes) than for neutral liposomes (similar to mammalian cells), while analogue P5F exhibits comparable affinities for both membranes. Therefore, our data suggest that the central Pro-induced kink is involved in selectivity, inhibiting peptide binding to the membranes of eukaryotic cells.",

            "text": "Polycystin-2, encoded by PKD2, is an integral membrane protein with a size of 110 kDa and 968 amino acids. The protein, which is known to be a Ca 2+ permeable, non selective cation channel, interacts with several proteins such as Polycystin-1, PIGEA14 or PACS-1/-2 etc. The interaction takes place through a proposed coiled-coil domain of Polycystin-2 located at the C-terminus of the protein.If mutation of either PKD2 or PKD1 (gene product of Polycystin-1) occurs, the interaction between the proteins is disturbed leading to increased formation of renal cysts. This autosomal polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common genetic diseases causing renal failure due to the enormous cyst formation. In this study, the interaction of the C-terminus of Polycystin-2 with its postulated specific interaction partners has been investigated in terms of its biological relevance. Binding affinities as well as kinetic parameters of the interaction were determined. In particular, the interaction of C-Polycystin-1 and PIGEA14 immobilized on solid supported membranes with C-Polycystin-2 has been quantified by means of the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) method. A dissociation constant of about 100 nM was obtained. The results are compared with those obtained by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technique using a different immobilization strategy.",

            "text": "Most of the reported fluorescence microscopy applications on Langmuir lipid films are focused in obtaining fluorescence intensity images using particular fluorescence probes. In this type of experiments the probes are generally utilized to obtain \"contrast\" between membrane regions (lipid domains) displaying dissimilar physical properties. The obtained information largely depends on the partition of the fluorescent probes for the lipid domains and the obtained fluorescence intensity pictures are not providing any information about the local physical properties of the lipid film. Local physical properties of these distinct regions can be determined by exploring fluorescent probe related parameters such lifetime, emission shift, polarization. However these fluorescent probe's properties are almost unexplored in this type of experiments. This presentation will focus in describing a new experimental setup that includes a specially designed film balance on top of a custom built multiphoton excitation fluorescence microscope. This setup allows obtaining LAUR-DAN GP images (1) Many studies on phase separations of lipids in bilayers and their leaflet asymmetry make use of fluorescence techniques. We used a dithionite assay, steady-state fluorescence anisotropy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) for characterization. Dithionite assay was performed to measure the fluorophore distribution in the inner and outer leaflets of symmetric membranes. For low concentrations, the fluorophore is distributed almost homogeneously, whereas for concentrations > 0.5 mol % it accumulates in the outer leaflet. We discuss these effects taking into account the presence of multilamellar liposomes and dynamic effects produced by higher local bending elasticities. The results point out possible artifacts in the use of fluorophores to characterize bilayers under the assumption of their homogeneous distribution. Dithionite relative bilayer permeability is discussed. The results won by FRET and steady-state fluorescence anisotropy regarding lipid phase transitions are in good coincidence to each other and to results reported in the literature. The photosensitizing properties of three chlorins are compared in solution and when incorporated in dioleoylphosphatidylcholine vesicules. In solution, they possess a similar efficacy to generate singlet oxygen and a similar ability to induce the peroxidation. However, the role of the photosensitizer localization within the lipidic bilayer is strongly highlighted, when chlorins are incorporated in liposomes, both by the changes in order of peroxidation efficacy but by the measurements of the photoinduced permeation of the liposomes. The results are discussed in relation with the technology of photochemical internalization, PCI. Then, using Giant unilamellar vesicles, we asymmetrically oxidize the membranes. We observed different shape transitions, such as budding, typical of membrane curvature modifications. The asymmetry of the shape transitions are in accordance to a lowered effective spontaneous curvature of the leaflet targeted. This effect is interpreted as a decreased preferred area of the targeted leaflet compared to the other, due to the secondary products of oxidation. Permeabilization of GUV by photooxidation is interpret as the opening of a pore above a critical membrane tension due to the budding of vesicles. The effective spontaneous curvature of photosensitized vesicle at lysis was estimated. Additionally photooxidation was shown to be fusogenic.",

Polyphenols were shown to be good antioxidants and to act as antyhemolytic agents. Both the activities are the result of polyphenols incorporation into biological membranes. To check potential changes they induce in membranes some experiments were performed with the use of erythrocytes, and lipid membranes. It was found that the extracts studied induced shape transitions of erythrocytes. They were classified according to the Bessis-Brecher scale. Strawberry extract induced mainly discocytes and discoechinocytes. Populations of discocytes, echinocytes and some discoechinocytes were found on applying apple extract, while chokeberry induced mainly the formation of echinocytes and spheroechinocytes. The results evidence that the polyphenols incorporate into the external monolayer of lipid bilayer of the erythrocyte membrane. The results of the fluorimetric experiments showed that all the extracts changed fluidity in the hydrophilic part of RBC membrane. The changes observed were biggest for chokeberry extract and smallest for strawberry one. Incorporation was also followed by changes in electrical resistance of black lipid membranes and in shifting the temperatures of main transition (T m ) and pretransition (T p ) in liposomes.

Tat is concentrated in the nucleus and nucleolus of infected cells. The protein is composed of 86 amino acids with a molecular weight of 11 kDa. Tat is a transcriptional activator protein, which stimulates RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription elongation. Therefore, Tat interacts with Cyclin T1 and binds to the TAR RNA element. Tat has different domains. With respect to the interaction with lipid membranes, the most important structural motif is its basic region, including 6 arginine and 2 lysine residues. The peptide derived from this basic region belongs to the cell-penetrating peptides and is able to translocate through lipid membranes. The major aim of this study is to investigate the influence of full length HIV-1 Tat on artificial lipid membranes. As a starting point solid-supported membranes composed of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphocholine (POPC) immobilized on silicon dioxide were used. The influence of the lipid head groups on the interaction with Tat was analysed by using membranes composed of the negatively charged lipid 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-L-serine] (POPS) in a mixture with POPC. Fluorescently labelled Tat was used to localise the protein in the membrane. The impact of Tat on lipid membranes was investigated by fluorescence and atomic force microscopy, showing that it is capable of perturbing lipid membranes.",

            "text": "Most antimicrobial peptides exert their activity by perturbing the permeability of bacterial membranes, but the molecular details of this process are still debated. Here, we compare fluorescence experiments and molecular dynamics simulations regarding the interaction of two antimicrobial peptides (PMAP-23 and trichogin GA IV) with lipid membranes, showing that their mechanisms of bilayer perturbation are significantly different. PMAP-23, a cationic peptide member of the cathelicidin family, associates to the membrane close to its surface and parallel to it, and in this arrangement it causes a severe perturbation to the bilayer, both regarding its surface tension and lipid order. On the other hand, trichogin GA IV, a neutral peptide member of the peptaibol family, undergoes a transition from a surface-bound state to an inserted orientation. In the first arrangement it does not cause any strong membrane perturbation, while in the second orientation it may span the bilayer from one side to the other, despite its relatively short length, by causing a significant thinning of the membrane. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the main component of the outer membrane of Gram negative bacteria. LPS is also known as endotoxin because of its potency to induce sepsis, a serious source of mortality in many clinical cases. Among LPS-neutralizing agents, polymyxin B (PxB) is considered as the \"gold standard\" due to its high efficiency of binding and detoxification of endotoxin. In this work, we have further explored the interaction of PxB to LPS from the rough mutant of Salmonella minnesota (Re-LPS) both in the gel and in the liquid crystalline phase, using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and fluorescence based techniques. The effect of PxB binding on LPS-membrane integrity was determined with a fluorescence quenching assay treating vesicles of LPS labeled with NBD-PE with dithionite. Thermodynamic parameters associated with the binding process as well as binding stoichiometry were obtained from ITC experiments. Finally, ITC was conducted with Enterococcus faecalis and Salmonella typhimurium, as representative examples of a Gram negative and a Gram positive bacterium respectively.",

As well as being broadly applicable, pressure changes can be applied very quickly both up and down in contrast to other structure change triggers such as temperature jumps. Fast pressure jumps allow the trigger to be decoupled from structural changes, so with fast structure probe techniques such as time resolved X-ray diffraction, the out-of-equilibrium evolution of these systems can be monitored. Despite great advantages, high pressure remains under-utilised primarily due to its technical difficulty. In response to this technology vacuum a high pressure user facility based around a pressure jump cell for small and wide angle X-ray diffraction has been commissioned at beamline I22, Diamond Light Source, UK and will be freely available to the user community. The cell is highly robust requiring virtually no user intervention during an experiment and the pressure system is computer controlled with a graphical user interface and is integrated with the beamline. Pressures between 0 and 0.5 GPa are accessible and jumps can be carried out in approximately 5 ms at temperatures from -10 to 120 \u2022 C.

Bozic Institute of Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana, Lipi\u010deva 2, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia Membrane inclusions such as membrane embedded peptides or proteins exhibit curvature dependent interaction with the surrounding lipid matrix due to the mismatch between their intrinsic curvature and the local membrane curvature. This interaction causes an inhomogeneous lateral distribution of the inclusions and a corresponding adjustment of the vesicle shape. By taking into consideration that the membrane free energy includes elastic energy of the lipid bilayer and a contribution due to an inclusion-membrane interaction, the configurations of lipid vesicles with mobile inclusions have been studied theoretically. The variational problem to calculate equilibrium vesicle shapes is solved by applying a Ritz method based on an expansion in spherical harmonics. In general, vesicle shapes adjust to the presence of inclusions by increasing regions with favorable curvature and decreasing regions of unfavorable curvature in such a way that the lateral distribution of inclusions becomes inhomogeneous. If the number of inclusions or the inclusion-membrane interaction exceeds a certain value, the prolate shapes become globally stable.",

Serotonin 1A receptors are prototypical members of the Gprotein coupled receptor superfamily and represent a prime target for therapeutic actions of several anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs. Interestingly, we observed significant retention in fluorescence of serotonin 1A receptors upon Triton X-100 treatment of intact cells at low temperature demonstrating their detergent insolubility. We analyzed the role of cholesterol in the plasma membrane organization of the serotonin 1A receptor by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) measurements with varying bleach spot sizes. Our results show that lateral diffusion parameters of serotonin 1A receptors are altered in cholesterol-depleted cells in a manner that is consistent with dynamic confinement of serotonin 1A receptors in the plasma membrane. Interestingly, results from FRAP measurements performed under conditions of mild cytoskeletal destabilization suggest that receptor signaling is correlated with receptor mobility, in agreement with the 'mobile receptor hypothesis'. Our current work is focused on exploring the oligomerization of the receptor using photobleaching anisotropy measurements and indicates the presence of constitutive oligomers of the serotonin 1A receptor in live cells.",

In contrast to human tissue cultures, the system allows for high cell densities up to 30 million cells per mL and the cells can be cultivated by fermentation. Cx43+GFP was successfully visualized in D. discoideum by confocal laser scanning microscopy, where it was preferentially found in the plasma membrane.After the cells were harvested, plasma membranes were prepared and both proteins (Cx43 and Cx43+GFP) were verified by western blot analysis. The proteins were solubilized by addition of 5% n-octyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside and purified by ion metal chelate affinity chromatography. The activities of both proteins were confirmed by a cytochrome C assay. After the purification of both proteins, they were reconstituted in \u00b5m-sized pore-suspending membranes.

In this study, the effect of smooth LPS (s-LPS) on the surface activity of lung surfactant was evaluated. To that end we investigated the behavior of DPPC films containing s-LPS, with and without surfactant protein A (SP-A) in the subphase, using epifluorescence microscopy combined with a surface balance. Our data show that s-LPS injected into the subphase incorporated into DPPC films forming mixed DPPC/s-LPS monolayers. Cospread s-LPS fluidized the DPPC monolayer as demonstrated by epifluorescence images and changes in the compressibility modulus of the monolayer as a function of s-LPS molar fraction (X s\u2212LPS ). The presence of low amounts of s-LPS in the monolayer promoted early collapse, preventing high surface pressures to be reached. Moreover, s-LPS hampered the re-spreading of DPPC molecules during dynamic compression at s-LPS concentrations as small as X s\u2212LPS = 0.02. Such inhibitory effects could not be relieved by repeated compression-expansion cycles or by adding surfactant protein A. However, SP-A facilitated the squeeze-out of s-LPS from DPPC/s-LPS mixed monolayers, suggesting that SP-A is an s-LPS scavenger.",

Alonso Unidad de Biof\u00edsica (CSIC-UPV/EHU) and Departamento de Bioqu\u00edmica, U. Pa\u00eds Vasco (UPV/EHU), Spain A set of biophysical approaches have been applied to study the phase behaviour of palmitoylsphingomyelin (pSM)/cholesterol (Chol) model membranes upon palmitoylceramide (pCer) addition. Fluorescence spectroscopy of di-4-ANEPPDHQ-stained pSM/Chol vesicles reveals no segregation of large liquid-ordered (l o ) microdomains. In contrast, the formation of disperse, compositionally homogeneous l o pSM/Chol (3:1) nanodomains over a pSM gel (L \u03b2 ) phase is proposed. DSC measurements show that pCer addition to vesicles with coexisting l o and L \u03b2 phases (low [Chol] ) induces the formation of large gel-like pSM/pCer microdomains, coexisting with a l o pSM/Chol phase. The \u2206H for the pSM/pCer phase at high pSM/(Chol+pCer) ratio is close to that of the binary mixture in the absence of Chol, supporting immiscibility, but no displacement, between Chol and pCer-rich phases. On the contrary, both confocal microscopy of GUVs and the DSC data coincide in showing that a rise in pCer increases the gel-like phase to a lower extent than in the pure pSM/pCer mixture, revealing some Cholinduced restriction. In the presence of a pure l o pSM/Chol phase (high [Chol] ), pCer addition is unable to induce the formation of large pSM/pCer microdomains. The present data support the role of Chol as the key determinant in controlling its own displacement from l o domains by ceramide.",

One or more long hydrophobic chains attached to the quinone ring alter their hydrophobicity and electron availability. We aimed at their influence on the structure of membranes. Different pHs highlights the charge/polarity effect on the interaction and on the morphology of the bilayer. For that, POPE and POPC, lipids with different charges, but identical chains were selected. X-rays diffraction on POPE/2,6BATH, 100/1 at different temperatures and pH, showed cubic phases coexisting with the usual phases formed by simply hydrated POPE, at different pHs. For investigation of the charge/polarity, we turned to the POPC/2,6BATH system (smaller charge/polarity). Despite decrease in temperature of phase transition and dimensions of the lattice, the structures were the same as in hydrated lipid, illustrating a less significant effect than on the similar lipid POPE. Another additive, 2,5ATH, mixed with POPE showed the effect of multiple thioalky chains. No morphology change was seen, compared to pure lipid.

They are highly conserved in evolution and the mammalian family contains 16 isoforms. We now show that the tandem C2 domains of several calcium-sensitive synaptotagmin isoforms tested, including Drosophila synaptotagmin, rapidly cross-link phospholipid membranes. In contrast to the tandem structure, individual C2 domains failed to trigger membrane cross-linking in several novel assays. Large-scale liposomal aggregation driven by tandem C2 domains in response to calcium was confirmed by the following techniques: turbidity assay, dynamic lightscattering and both confocal and negative stain electron microscopy. High-resolution cryo-electron microscopy revealed that membrane cross-linking by tandem C2 domains results in a constant distance of approximately 9 nm between the apposed membranes. Our findings show the conserved nature of this important property of synaptotagmin, demonstrate the significance of the tandem C2 domain structure and provide a plausible explanation for the accelerating effect of synaptotagmins on membrane fusion. Membrane proteins can be challenging samples to work with and as such often require the use of multiple techniques. Here we present an insight into the structure of the antimicrobial peptide melittin in lipid membranes using various techniques. We explore the conformational changes of membrane-bound melittin and its interaction with model membrane lipid systems with a series of spectroscopic methods that can be used in parallel. The techniques used include linear dichroism and FT-IR for orientation information and circular dichroism for conformation information. We use dynamic light scattering for molecular sizing, fluorescence emission for information on peptide environment, thin-layer chromatography for lipid identification, analytical ultracentrifugation to identify oligomerisation state and calorimetry to investigate the thermodynamics. We observe how the physical properties of both the peptide and the membranes affect the insertion kinetics of the peptide in the membrane.",

Here we report results of a gel phase bilayer at 283 K and of a liquid crystal phase bilayer at 303 K. Coherent and incoherent dynamic structure factors and meansquare displacements have been calculated from the trajectories for both the inplane and out-of-plane lipid dynamics. Moreover, the results have been compared to recent quasi-elastic and inelastic neutron scattering data. Optical tweezers allow trapping of particles of different types in a wide range of sizes [1] . Among these, unilamellar vesicles are of interest as they are known to be effective vectors in drug delivery and they are also studied as models for cell membranes. This work focuses on the interactions between optically confined unilamellar vesicles and their cross-linking by proteins [2] . Synaptotagmins are vesicular proteins implicated in many membrane trafficking events having an accelerating effect on the membrane fusion. Calcium-sensitive synaptotagmins are thought to confer calcium sensitivity to the fusion of secretory vesicles with target membranes [3] . The novel optical assay reported here allowed us to visualize the cross-linking of 600 nm liposomes mediated by synaptotagmin and calcium. The use of the optical tweezers approach to investigate the function of other fusogenic proteins related to exocytosis (i.e., SNARE proteins) is discussed as well. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have received increasing interest as the search for new potential antibiotics has become imperative due to increasing bacterial multiresistance. Acylating the natural occurring Polymyxin B (PMB) significantly enhances antibacterial activity towards two representative Gram-negative bacteria E. coli and K. pneumonia compared to the nonacylated PMB. The aim of the presented work was to study various biophysical parameters, such as partitioning coefficients, zeta potentials and effective charges of a selected AMP, mastoparan-X (MPX) and a propanoylated (PAMPX) and octanoylated (OAMPX) analogue, respectively. Fluorescence spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry and \u03b6-potential measurements were the main techniques used for the measurements. We employed 2 different LUV model systems; a partially charged (POPG/POPC 1:3) and a neutral system (POPC). For the neutral LUVs there was an increase in partitioning with increasing length of the acyl chain, whereas partioning into the partially charged LUVs was governed by a balance of hydrophobic and electrostatic contributions. The selectivity for the partially charged LUVs over the neutral LUVs was in the order PAMPX, MPX and OAMPX. The modeled effective charge for the peptide followed the same trend as the partitioning coefficient for the three peptides for the respective LUV systems.",

Morphological and functional changes in different compartments of the endocytic pathway are connected to several diseases. A crucial step in understanding biogenesis of lysosomes and their role in disease conditions, is to characterise the properties of the lysosomal membrane. By the use of TLC we have found that lysosomes contain non-neglible amounts of triglycerides (TG). To investigate how the presence of TGs could influence the lysosomal membrane, we have investigated the properties of a mixture of POPC and triolein, as a simple model for the lysosomal membrane. We found the system to form two types of POPC-rich membranes. These were determined as co-existing phases based on their spontaneous and stable separation and named heavy and light phase according to their sedimentation behaviour. By using EPR and fluorescence spectroscopy the physical properties, including order, fluidity and water penetration, of these phases were found to differ markedly despite of their almost identical composition. The results suggest that presence of TGs on lysosomal membranes could have a crucial effect in the barrier functions and thus, the integrity of the organelle. Model membranes with the capacity to align in magnetic fields such as bicelles and magnetically sensitive vesicles are of high interest, since their macroscopically alignment allows for the determination of structure, dynamics and topology of molecules within the membrane [1] . We performed 31 P solid state NMR on a magnetically sensitive lipid possessing a large positive magnetic anisotropy introduced in form of a biphenyl unit during lipid synthesis in one of its acyl chains (1-tetradecanoyl-2-(4-(4biphenyl) butanoyl)-snglycero-3-phosphocholine (TBBPC)). The phosphorus lineshapes of TBBPC MLVs studied at various magnetic fields (7.1T, 9.4T, 11.7T, 16.4T), revealed a drastic change in shape upon exposure to fields > 9.4 Tesla: resonances resulting from phospholipid molecules oriented perpendicular to the magnetic field decrease whereas resonances resulting from parallel oriented molecules increase. This is a sign for magnetically induced vesicle deformation from vesicle to oblate ellipsoid shape. Factors influencing this drastic deformation, such as magnetic anisotropy, membrane elasticity, lipid chain length and field dependency are discussed based on existing theories [2] . Hepatitis G virus (GBV-C/HGV) is an enveloped viruses belonging to the Flaviviridae family. Clinical findings have suggested that in people co-infected with GBV-C/HGV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), delayed progression of AIDS has been observed (1). The mechanism by which this virus may inhibit the progression of AIDS remain to be elucidated. Enveloped viruses acquire their lipid membranes by budding through host cellular membranes (2) , in this process; fusion peptides play an important role. Study of the interaction of HGV-C peptides with lipid membranes could lead us useful information about the mechanism that takes place. In this work we present a study on the effects of E1 peptides on the fluidity of and polarizability of model membranes (DMPC and DPPC liposomes) by DSC and fluorescence polarization. Both techniques showed that the presence of the studied sequences in phospholipid mixtures already affected the thermotropic properties of the gel to liquid-crystalline phase transition. Systems were thermodynamically charac- Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) studies have been performed to study the structural changes induced in membranes of vesicles prepared from phospholipid and mixed phospholipid-sterol mixtures, in the presence of different concentrations of the anti-fungal drug, amphotericin B (AmB).The vesicles, sonicated to a mean size\u223c100nm, were prepared using dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine(DMPC) or DMPC-cholesterol or DMPC-ergosterol mixtures -with both of the mixed systems involving 30mol% sterol. Analysis of the SANS data show that when the concentration of AmB added is just above the drug's cmc (\u223c1\u00b5M) there is an increase in the membrane thickness of both the DMPC-chol and DMPC-erg vesicles (both cases + 4\u00c5), but the thickness of the pure DMPC vesicle membranes remains the same as in the absence of AmB. When AmB is added at a concentration in excess of its cmc (\u223c10\u00b5M), the mixed-sterol vesicles show the same changes in membrane thickness as observed with the lower AmB concentration, and the pure DMPC vesicles again remain unaffected. On the basis of these studies, therefore, there appears to be no difference in the structural changes induced by the insertion of AmB into the model fungal cell membranes (mimicked by DMPC-erg vesicles and those resulting from its insertion into the model mammalian cell membranes (mimicked by DMPC-chol vesicles). The third transmembrane helix of bacteriorhodopsin, also known as pHLIP, is a unique model system for studying the interactions of a natural transmembrane domain with lipid membranes: depending on pH, the water-soluble peptide either adsorbs superficially or inserts as a transmembrane helix on addition of lipid vesicles [1] . Published values for the free energies of these processes were based on a stoichiometric model invoking two distinct sets of binding sites [2] . However, discrepancies between data obtained from different experimental techniques and inconsistencies between experimental and expected temperature dependencies suggest that these values should be taken with caution. We therefore reassessed membrane interactions of pHLIP using titration calorimetry and fluorescence spectroscopy. If electrostatic effects at the membrane surface are taken into account, the data can be described quantitatively by a partition equilibrium, but not by a stoichiometric binding model. The thermodynamics of membrane partitioning differ substantially from those determined previously [2] and draw a different picture of peptide-lipid interactions. Beyond deepening our insights into the first step of the two-stage model of membrane protein folding, this also sheds light on the ability of pHLIP to drag cargo molecules across lipid membranes. Adsorption of monolysine and polylysines at the surface of lipid membranes of varied composition was studied by two methods. Both methods -the electrokinetic one, measured the surface potential of liposomes, and the Intramembranouse Field Compensation sensitive to boundary potential of planar bilayer lipid membranes -detected the positive changes of the potentials for membranes with negatively charged component (cardiolipin, CL). Neither monolysine, nor polylysines adsorbed at neutral membranes (phosphatidylcholine, PC). Pentalysine show the difference between these potentials for the membranes composed from CL/PC mixtures. This difference is attributed to dipole part of boundary potential and indicates the changes in lipid packing. Polylysines show high affinity to the membrane and saturation with plateau. These saturation levels correspond to surface charge densities 0.005 and 0.016 C/m 2 for oligomers with 5 and 12 units, and 0.032 C/m 2 for polymers with 130 and 1435 units. These values do not depend on the ionic strength of background electrolyte but proportional to the content of negatively charged components in the lipid bilayer. The polylysine layer at the mica surface was studied by atomic-force microscope (AFM) technique. It was shown that pentalysine molecules cover the surface by the layer of 0.8 nm thickness and polylysines of high molecular weight by the layer up to 4 nm.",

LPCs and FAs form micelles in solution and thus act as detergents in the presence of lipid membranes. In the present study we investigate the detergent strength of a homologous series of lysolipids (LPCs) on POPC lipid membranes by use of Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) and Vesicle Fluctuation Analysis (VFA). The membrane partition coefficient (K) and critical micelle concentration (CMC) are determined and found to obey an inverse proportionality relation (CMC x K \u223c constant). The partition coefficient and critical micelle concentration are used for the analysis of LPC's effect on the membrane bending rigidity. The dependence of the bending rigidity on the LPC membrane coverage has been analyzed in terms a phenomenological model based on continuum elastic theory which yield information about the curvature inducing properties of the LPC molecule. The results reveal: (I) an increase in the partition coefficient with LPC acyl-chain length and (II) the degree in acyl chain mismatch between LPC and POPC determines the magnitude of the membrane mechanical perturbation per LPC molecule on the membrane. Patch clamp electrophysiology remains the gold-standard for ion channel research because of the information richness of the data produced. Automated planar patch clamp devices, with their higher throughput and high data information content, have made the technique accessible to a wider audience. Nanion Technologies offers two planar patch clamp workstations combining higher throughput with high data quality. The Port-a-Patch records from a single cell at a time and the Patchliner from up to 8 cells simultaneously with high success rates (typically 60-80%). Both, the Port-a-Patch and the Patchliner are bench top patch clamp rigs which uses a planar borosilicate glass chip for obtaining a giga-seal for electrophysiological recordings. Suction applied from the underside of the chip is used to attract a single cell to the recording site without the need for optical visualization. Both workstations have been successfully used for whole cell, perforated patch, and cell attached recordings as well as for GUV-bilayer recordings. Due to the versatility of Nanion`s products it is possible to study a wide variety of ion channels including NaV, KV, CaV, ligandgated, hERG or reconstituted proteins such as KscA, Cx26, OmpC. Special features unique to Nanion products, including but not limited to internal solution exchange and temperature control, expand the experimental possibilities.",

Matthias Univiversity of Augsburg, Experimental Physics I, Biological Physics Group, Augsburg, Germany \" For the sake of illustration we shall try to provide a physical basis for the equations, but must emphasize that the interpretation given is unlikely to provide a correct picture of the membrane.\" [ Hodgkin&Huxley, 1952 ] To explain the occurrence of reversible heat production during nerve pulse propagation it has been suggested by multiple authors [Wilke,Kaufmann,Heimburg] that travelling sound waves and not ion channels may offer a better explanation than the Hodgkin&Huxley theory. Therefore, if sound waves are an essential feature of the nerve membrane they should also appear on lipid monolayers where ion conductivity is evidently absent. Here we demonstrate that sound waves can be excited on a lipid monolayer by using a set of planar electrodes incorporated into the monolayer and driven by an alternating voltage. Not only do our results indicate propagating waves on lipid monolayers in accordance with their thermodynamic predictions, but importantly, no significant attenuation is detected proposing an adiabatic phenomenon. In order to provide evidence that our physical explanation provides a correct picture of the membrane, direct detection of the waves was done, whereas a clear transduction of signals was shown. Finally, the impact of toxins, neuropharmaca and anaesthetics needs to be integrated in our physical picture of the nerve membranes, what can easily be done now and could deliver a new approach for understanding their physical mechanism. Our earlier studies showed that organometallic compounds (OTC) in the presence of UVC radiation enhanced the degree of phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposome oxidation, whereas quercetin effectively protected the membrane. The present investigation is concerned with the effect of UVB and OTC (chlorides of diphenyl-and dibutyltin, triphenyl-and tributyltin), both in combined action and separately, on oxidation of erythrocyte proteins, PC liposome and albumin. The degree of oxidation of proteins and liposomes induced by OTC and radiation, also in the presence of selected antioxidants (trolox, quercetin) was determined on the basis of changes in the number of sulfhydryl groups, carbonyl groups and malone dialdehyde, respectively. The studies indicate that UVB induces PC liposome and erythrocyte oxidation, whereas in the case of albumin it causes both an increase in the number of C=O groups and free SH groups (most probably, braking sulphonic bridges). OTC compounds interact with membrane biomolecules both as weak pro-and antioxidants, also in combined action (UVB plus OTC). The prooxidative effects are markedly diminished by application of antioxidants. The action of quercetin results from its ability to incorporate into membranes and formation of complexes with OTC (liposome>erythrocyte>albumine). This work was supported by grant N N3364 34. A phospholipase C/ sphingomyelinase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been assayed on giant unilamellar vesicles (GUV) consisting of phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylethanolamine, and cholesterol, at equimolar ratios. The enzyme activity modifies the chemical composition, thus the physical properties of the bilayer, and conversely the latter influence the enzyme activity. Biochemical assays of enzyme activity, together with confocal fluorescence microscopy examination of GUV provide novel information about the system. The original lipid composition in the absence of enzyme gives rise to lateral phase separation of liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered domains in the GUV. The two enzyme end-products, diacylglycerol and ceramide, have opposite effects on the bilayer physical properties, the former abolishes lateral phase separation, while the latter generates a new gel phase. Morphological examination of individual GUV shows that the enzyme binds preferentially the more fluid (or more disordered) domains, and that, in most cases, it causes the fluidification (disordering) of the other domains.. Cholesterol incorporation into lipid bilayers, in the form of multilamellar vesicles or extruded large unilamellar vesicles, has been quantitated. To this aim, the cholesterol contents of bilayers prepared from phospholipid:cholesterol mixtures (33-75 mol% cholesterol) have been measured and compared with the original mixture before lipid hydration. There is a great diversity of cases, but under most conditions the actual cholesterol proportion present in the bilayers is much lower than expected. The maximum solubility of Chol in bilayers containing saturated PC or PC with less than four unsaturations is 50-60mol%, while in polyunsaturated PC, e. g. diC18:4, and in sphingomyelin the maximum Chol contents is 23mol%. A quantitative analysis of the vesicles is thus required before any experimental study is undertaken.",

Steinem Institute of Organic and Biomolecular Chemistry, University of G\u00f6ttingen, Germany Membrane fusion has attracted significant interest due to its biological relevance. Thus in recent years a great variety of fusion assays has been developed. Since the process of membrane fusion is not yet fully understood, our aim is to develop a new fusion assay based on pore-spanning membranes, which have been proven mechanically stable, highly insulating and rather tension free. The application of these so-called micro-BLMs should allow simultaneous monitoring of lipid mixing, content release as well as electrical readouts. Furthermore both membrane sides can be addressed individually to apply transmembrane potential or fusion modulating compounds. First results show that the micro-BLMs provide the opportunity to investigate lipid bilayer fusion by means of fluorescence microscopy. The formation of porespanning membranes is achieved by the painting technique of DPhPC doped with Oregon Green DHPE dissolved in ndecane. The addition of large unilamellar vesicles doped with Texas Red DHPE allows direct observation of single fusion events. Lipid mixing during fusion leads to a decrease of the donor fluorescence (Oregon Green) and an increase in acceptor fluorescence intensity (Texas Red) in the plane of the planar bilayer due to FRET. In future work simultaneous monitoring of lipid-mixing and content release combined with electrical measurements are planned to gain further insight into different intermediate steps of membrane fusion.",

These are combined with other techniques such as dynamic light scattering and fluorescence spectroscopy to elucidate the mechanisms of action of the peptides. One of the most important aspects of membrane-active peptide design is that of specificity. We investigate specificity for different types of membranes by using libraries of lipids with different properties of charge, chain saturation and curvature stress. In this way one can test for effects of e.g. negatively charged head groups found in bacterial membranes or cholesterol found in animal and human membranes. Using these approaches it is proposed that we will be able to modify peptide sequences, test what part of the kinetic processes are affected and subsequently use this information to design new and better antibiotics.",

In comparison to other amphitropic proteins it exhibits a distinct membrane interaction behavior. A patch of positively charged amino acid residues contacts anionic phospholipids via electrostatic interactions, and a hydrophobic loop anchores the protein into the outer leaflet of the membrane via hydrophobic interactions. The binding constant depends on physical properties of the membrane such as membrane lipid composition, surface potential, lipid packing density and curvature. The binding of an amphitropic protein alters the membrane's spontaneous curvature as well as the difference between the equilibrium areas of membrane leaflets. Theoretical model has been developed to predict vesicles shape transformations realized by the formation of buds. It was shown that the effects are stronger for flaccid vesicles which were therefore chosen for our experimental investigations. Vesicles were composed of 20 % POPS and 80 % POPC, and flaccidity was achieved by an osmotic adjustment. The solution containing \u03b2 2 GPI was subsequently injected to a chamber with flaccid vesicles by a syringe pump. Observation took place under a phase-contrast microscope. Experiments showed a concentration dependent occurrence of buds. Their number and size were related to the degree of vesicle flaccidness.",

The complexity of this task arises from the structural dependence of membrane proteins on their anisotropic environment and in particular by a delicate balance between different physico-chemical properties. In order to study these properties in a small protein detergent complex, we have used molecular dynamics simulations on the transmembrane part of Glycophorin A (GpAtm) solubilized in micelles of the detergent di-hexanoyl-phosphatidylcholine(D6PC). We show that the molecular aggregates organizes to give distinct populations of detergent molecules. Those molecules which loosely interact with the peptide are preferentially involved in highly cohesive inter-detergent interactions that impose a global bilayer structure to the micelle. Interaction profiles of other detergents with GpAtm depend upon the nature of residues along the surface of the peptide. This topology dependence leads to different modes and strength of interactions that ultimately constrain the orientation of the micelles around the peptide. This simple model illustrates how differential detergent selectivity for faces and strong constraints coming from purely environmental features could influence transmembrane helix packing, membrane protein structure and assembly. In this paper we present a study of a new family of bolaamphiphiles. These amphiphiles are unsymmetrical bolalipids having one sugar polar head and the second glycine betaine polar head. They are potentially useful for pharmaceutical or cosmetics applications as vectors for drugs. Therefore it is important to investigate their self-assembled properties. The chemical variations that we introduced in this new family concern the length of the main chain that connects two polar heads as well as the length of the side chain placed on the position 1 of the sugar moiety. Another variation concerns the introduction of a diacetylenic unit into the main chain in order to rigidify it. We have performed the SAXS (Small Angle X-ray Scattering) measurements on the dehydrated compounds as a function of temperature and observed the lamellar liquid crystalline structures. We also measured the SAXS spectra of aqueous solutions of these compounds that have shown lamellar L \u03b1 structure in all cases. These measurements are compared with polarised optical microscopy measurements that confirmed our interpretation.",

Abundant work has been done on tube extrusion from cells and model membranes under the application of external forces. We present a novel system allowing tube formation in the absence of external forces. Aqueous solutions of two chemically dissimilar polymers, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dextran are encapsulated in giant vesicles, a cell-size model system. The exposure of vesicles to hypertonic solutions induces phase separation of the internal aqueous polymer solution. The excess membrane area created by this vesicle deflation, engages in the formation of tubular structures. Membrane tube formation and phase separation are coupled processes. Hydrodynamic flows and changes in the membrane spontaneous curvature during phase separation might be the driving forces for tube formation. The tubes are rather stable: without external perturbation, they can exist for several days. They prefer to be located in the PEG-rich phase at low polymer concentration. At high concentration, they are absorbed at the interface of the liquid phases to lower the surface energy of the system by decreasing the contact area between the liquid phases. The membrane tubes can be retracted back to the vesicle surface by increasing the membrane tension via vesicle aspiration. Membrane tubes, which can form and be retracted easily, might be relevant to lipid storage in cells.",

They have been of interest for their ability to translocate not only themselves through cellular membranes, but also carry along with them, cargo as large as iron nanoparticles. The exact entry mechanism remains unclear, but has been shown to vary with peptide sequence. Their translocation properties have been demonstrated through different experiments involving vesicles, cells and living animals. We plan on using nano-black lipid membranes (nano-BLM), which span the pores of nanoporous materials as a model system to study the interaction between CPP and lipid membranes. The nanopores can be used as cellular containers whose interior surface can be functionalized with receptors for biotin-streptavidin recognition. We hope that this system will provide greater control over experimental variables, such as the type of CPP and lipid used, as well as provide kinetic data that can be used to evaluate CPP activity and the kinetics of cargo transport. Ethanol induces phospholipid acyl chain interdigitation. While much is known, important issues remain unclear, such as the role of lipid domains. The main purpose of this study was to follow, in real time, the changes induced by ethanol on supported lipid bilayers with nano to microdomains by in situ Atomic Force Microscopy. To this goal, a pure lipid in the fluid phase (DOPC), a pure lipid in the gel phase (DPPC), binary phospholipid mixtures with gel/fluid phase coexistence, and cholesterol-containing, raft -forming mixtures (DOPC/DPPC/cholesterol and DOPC/sphingomyelin/cholesterol) were investigated. From the height differences observed upon ethanol addition to pure lipids (DPPC and DOPC), and to DOPC/DPPC mixtures, it is shown that in the binary system the interdigitation of the fluid phase occurs prior to the gel phase. However, for the lipid rafts mixtures the simultaneous interdigitation of both raft and non raft portions of the membrane is observed both in mica and silicon substrates. For all compositions studied, domain formation or rearrangement accompanied by lipid bilayer expansion occurs as a consequence of interdigitation. These results show the ability of ethanol to influence the bilayer properties in different ways according to membrane composition. Ethanol may exert its biological effects by reducing bilayer thickness, and also by changing membrane proteins conformation and lateral distribution, as a consequence of the altered properties of the lipid bilayer.",

There are several side effects connected with frequent use of NSAID, mainly gastrointestinal ulcers and bleedings.

The influence of three well-known non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs with a diverse gastric toxicity (aspirin, ketoprofen and piroxicam) and three newly-synthesized xanthone derivatives (belonging to the NSAIDs) on the structure and dynamics of lipid bilayers was studied using small angle X-ray scattering and molecular dynamics simulations. The results showed some correlation between NSAID toxicity and its binding to the lipid polar groups. This binding increases membrane fluidity by reducing its density due to an increased membrane surface area. A reduced lipid packing in the membrane most likely increases gastric mucosa permeability, which can result in a decreased resistance of the gastric mucosa to luminal acid. We studied the partition of the anionic amphiphile 1pyrenesulfonate (PSA) into MLV and LUV (produced by extrusion), composed by zwitterionic POPC and zwitterionic/anionic mixtures with POPS (until 10 mol %).

The critical micelle concentrations, the enthalpies (\u2206H m ) and the entropies (\u2206S m ) of micellization as well as the contributions of the headgroups to the Gibbs free energies (\u2206G m 0 (hy)) were calculated. QSPR analysis was also used to predict CMC of studied compounds. The interactions of C12-DGA and C12-DLA with model membranes (DPPC and DPPC/chol. bilayers) were studied by means of DSC. Using quantum computations some basic molecular properties were calculated. The conformational space was explored using molecular mechanics. Obtained results were compared with those for analogical compounds with single head groups, e.g. with also synthesised by us N-alkanoyl-Nmethyllactitolamines (C n MeLA) and common sugar-based surfactants C 12 Gluc and MEGA-10. Enfuvirtide (T-20) was the first HIV-1 fusion inhibitor peptide approved for clinical use. T-1249 is an inhibitor still under evaluation. Previous studies, based on tryptophan intrinsic fluorescence, showed that the peptides interact differentially with membrane model systems (LUV) with different lipid compositions. Studies with human blood cells were necessary to further establish the role of membranes on these peptides mode of action. An experimental strategy was applied based on the membrane dipole potential, as measured by the fluorescent probe di-8-ANEPPS. Human erythrocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were successfully labeled. For both systems, a fusion inhibitor concentration-dependent decrease on di-8-ANEPPS fluorescence excitation ratio (a measure of the spectral shift and dipole potential) was observed. The quantitative analysis of these variations indicated that T-1249 has an approximately ten-fold higher affinity towards erythrocyte and PBMC, when compared with enfuvirtide. This is in agreement with the previously known adsorption of T-1249 on cholesterol-rich membrane domains and with its higher partition constants. HIV associates with erythrocytes in vivo, which can constitute a route to deliver peptide to the viral membranes (also rich in cholesterol). Lymphocyte membranes can concentrate and accelerate the drug interactions with its molecular target, gp41 in its exposed conformation. Oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) is known to be a key step in atherogenesis, leading to inflammation, proliferation and apoptosis of cells of the arterial wall. These effects are largely exerted by oxidatively fragmented phospholipids, which are highly exchangeable between cells, tissues and lipoproteins. In particular, PGPC has been identified in minimally modified LDL and has been reported to elicit a wide range of pathophysiological responses in vascular cells, e.g. the activation of apoptotic signaling pathways. We investigated here the behavior of the fluorescent oxidized PGPE-Alexa647 compared to DHPE-Bodipy in artificial supported lipid bilayers with different cholesterol contents. The two labeled lipids differ in the type of membrane insertion: while DHPE-Bodipy is anchored to the membrane via two fatty acids, PGPE is incorporated with only one fatty acid. The second chain is an acyl fragment in sn-2 position, which represents the oxidation product of an unsaturated acyl chain. With increasing cholesterol content we observed a decrease in the diffusion coefficient for both lipids. Interestingly, the diffusion of the oxidized lipid was reduced in a higher degree compared to that of the non-oxidized lipid. The calculated ratios of the diffusion constants of PGPE-Alexa647 and DHPE-Bodipy suggest a different type of interaction with cholesterol. Membrane proteins account for a third of all proteins encoded for by the human genome, and play a vital role in a number of cellular processes. Few membrane protein structures have been determined to date in comparison to soluble proteins. This discrepancy is due to experimental difficulties in preparing membrane protein samples for structural analysis. Traditional techniques for studying membrane proteins by X-ray crystallography or solution NMR use detergent solubilised proteins which can differ from their native confirmations. Solid-state NMR allows the study of transmembrane proteins in lipid bilayers, representing a more native like environment in which to obtain biologically relevant structural information. We have been working on the development of reliable methods for reconstitution of transmembrane peptide into liposomes using Glycophorin A as a model TM protein.",

In order to confirm the secondary structure and insertion of GpA into lipid vesicles, techniques such as CD, OCD, FTIR and DLS have been used to provide quantitative information in addition to the visual results from EM. Nonesterified fatty acids regulate a broad spectrum of metabolic activities and are involved in many physiological, pathological and/or pharmacological processes in living cells. They spontaneously transfer between donors and acceptors such as fatty acid binding proteins and lipid membranes. We focus on protein-lipid dispersions of human serum albumin (HSA) and sterically stabilized liposomes (SSL) composed of DPPC and appropriate amount of PEG:2000-DPPE in which stearic acids (SA) are inserted either in the protein or in the SSL. Exploiting the fact that HSA has a single tryptophan residue and that the intrinsic Trp-fluorescence emission signal is quenced by the presence of SA, the kinetics of SA transport between HSA and PEG:2000-grafted DPPC membranes is studied by means of fluorescence. It is found that the transfer of SA between HSA and SSL is a first-order process and the kinetics of transfer depends on the type of donor and acceptor matrix, on the temperature (i.e., on the physical state of the lipid bilayers), and on the grafting density of the PEG-lipids at the protein/lipid interface. Indeed, in the absence of polymer-lipids, the rate of transfer increases with temperature in both directions of transfer and it is faster for the passage from DPPC bilayers to HSA. The presence of polymer-lipids reduces the rate of transfer both in the mushroom and in the brush regime of the polymer-chains, especially for lipid membranes in the fluid phase.",

Infections with STx lead to the haemolyticuraemic syndrome, which is known to be a major cause for renal failure at an early age. The interaction of the homopentameric B-subunit (STxB), which is responsible for binding and intracellular transport of the holotoxin, with its cellular receptor, the glycosphingolipid Gb 3 , is the first step for endocytosis of the toxin. One B-subunit can bind up to 15 Gb 3 -molecules to form STxB-Gb 3 -clusters causing negative curvature of a membrane. The binding of STxB to giant unilamellar vesicles, composed of DOPC, cholesterol and Gb 3 induces tubular membrane invaginations, which were also found in experiments with energy-depleted HeLa-cells. In recent studies, protein and lipid reorganization processes after attaching STxB to solid supported membranes, composed of DOPC/sphingomyelin/cholesterol/Gb 3 have been investigated. The compaction of Gb 3 -molecules led to an additional STxB-Gb 3 -enriched phase, which was also observed in lipid monolayers at the air/water interface.

Alveolar endotelium is formed by two kinds of cells: Neumocyte type I (NTI), which covers \u223c97% of the alveolar surface where gas exchange occurs and, NTII where lung surfactant (LS) is produced. LS are a mixture that lay over a water film in the luminal surface of the alveoli and it is thought to decrease the surface tension to avoid alveolar collapse during expiration. LS are made of phospholipids and proteins, which are determinant for the structure of LS under particular conditions of pressure and temperature. LS inside the cell is packed in organelles called lamellar bodies (LB), and is released to the water/air interphase in other conformation. In the present study we isolate LB from pig's lung and study LB thermodynamic characteristics by microcalorimetry in the presence and in the absence of structural proteins. Phase transition profile of LB with and without proteins is basically the same; while LS in the alveolar lumen have a higher transition temperature (Tm). Mayor changes in Tm are observed between LB and LS from alveolar lumen. Although LS lipid composition in and outside the cell is assumed to be the same, the ground for the differences in Tm under these two conditions is unknown.",

Their photodamage occurred at different rates when the target molecules and the singlet oxygen generating photosensitizer (phthalocyanin) were adsorbed to the same or to opposite sides of the planar lipid bilayer. The difference in the oxidation rates were attribute to singlet oxygen transport through lipid bilayer and therefore we were able to estimate the permeability of lipid bilayers to singlet oxygen. However, the apparent permeabilities derived from experiments with different targets were differ from each other. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that the lateral membrane diffusion of target molecules and oxidation product may have biased our analysis. In line with this anticipation we found that the apparent permeability is dependent on the size of the planar bilayer. The development of a new mathematical model, which takes the mobility of all reacting species in the aqueous and lipid environments into account, allowed estimation of the real membrane permeability to singlet oxygen. It appeared to be very close to that of oxygen in the ground state. A number of complex three-dimensional lyotropic liquid crystal phases are already known, such as the bicontinuous cubic phases, but so far only a single example has been found -a cubic phase of spacegroup Fd3m -of a structure based upon a complex close packing of inverse micelles (1) . We now report the discovery (2) of a novel lyotropic liquid crystal phase, of space group, P6 3 /mmc, whose structure is based upon a hexagonal close packing of identical quasi-spherical inverse micelles. The model membrane system consists of a hydrated mixture of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, dioleoylglycerol, and cholesterol. This novel phase has a number of unique features which may render it useful for a range of applications. Firstly, it is the only known self-assembled lyotropic phase whose structure consists of a periodic close packing of identical inverse micelles. Secondly, it is stable in excess aqueous solution, which is very important for potential biological or biomedical applications. References (1) V. Luzzati, V., R. Vargas, A. Gulik, P. Mariani, J.M.

Dystrophin rod domain contains 24 homologous repeats, where the sub-domain constituted by the repeats 11 to 15 (R11-15) was reported to bind actin and membrane lipids. We analyzed the interaction of R11-15 with lipid monolayers. To better understand the assembly mechanism of this protein with lipids, we studied its adsorption behavior at the air-liquid and lipid/liquid interface using ellipsometry, surface pressure, and atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Using two different mixtures of phospholipids, ellipsometry and pressure surface data show that R11-15 interacts with the lipid monolayers, but is inserted into the monolayer formed by DOPC-DOPS while it lies below the monolayer of DOPC-DOPE. This indicates that R11-15 interacts more strongly with DOPC-DOPS than with DOPC-DOPE. AFM images show that the pressure of lipid monolayer influences the organization of R11-15. When the lipid surface pressure is 30mN/m, R11-15 forms a striking network, indicating a protein-protein interaction in addition to the protein-lipid interaction. This unique behavior of one part of the central domain of dystrophin may explain its key role in muscle cell. Studies on polyphenol extracts from Helichrysum L., Fagopyrum Mill., Crataegus L. and Hypericum L. were performed in order to find if they may be applied as a natural free radical scavengers protecting biological membranes against peroxidation. Ghosts erythrocytes were used in the experiments. They were suspended in Tris-EDTA solution, pH 7,4, then.irradiated with a bactericidal lamp without (control) or with a proper amount of the extracts studied. The product of lipid peroxidation was malonic dialdehyde (MA). The colour reaction of MA with thiobarbituric acid (TBA) enables to determine the concentration of MA spectrophotometrically. It was found that peroxidation increased with the irradiation time. However, it significantly decreased when concentrations of poliphenols increased. The best antioxidtive property was found for Hypericum L. The antioxidative efficiency sequence of the plant extracts studied was the following: Hypericum L. > Crataegus L. > Fagopyrum Mill. > Helichrysum L. The results obtained indicate that polyphenol extracts exhibit excelent antioxidative properties that make them good free radical scavengers for efficient protection of biological membranes.

A significant change related to the appearance of quasi free spin labels was obtained for spin probes at the 12 th carbon atom and was more expressed for the asymmetrical derivative. Illuminating the samples the ESR amplitude decreased for all positions of the spin probe but to different extent. The effect was more expressed in case of the symmetrical derivative, especially for label positions 5 and 12. For the asymmetrical derivative the effect changed from moderate to weak from the 5 th to the 16 th position. This indicates that the asymmetrical derivative is incorporated nearer to the lipid head groups while the symmetrical one may be located deeper in the membrane.

Black lipid membranes (BLMs) were studied for decades but their potential for practical applications is hindered, mainly due to their lack of stability and limited lifespan. Recently, tethered bilayer lipid membranes (tBLMs) proved to have long life span of up to several months without significant changes in membrane resistance and capacitance. In order to combine advantages of BLMs and tBLMs, we have designed a membrane system which is freely spanned across a single nanopore in a silicon nitride membrane. This system not only mimics cell membranes, but also it allows control over the chemical composition of buffer with unlimited ionic reservoirs on both sides of the membrane. This freestanding tBLM maintains structural stability and lifetime of up to 120 hours without significant decrease in its structural integrity and electrical sealing. For the validation of the tBLM formation, we have inserted well known \u03b1-HL pores. We are able to control the amount of \u03b1-HL pores insertion and measure single channel ion transport across the tBLM by \u03b1-HL pores using a capacitor feedback amplifier.",

It has been shown that the chromatin complex composed of DNA, RNA and proteins also includes phospholipids, and that RNA colocalize with these 2 . Although the RNA-phospholipid interactions may have important implications to biological function, in gene therapy and in medicine, very little work has been dedicated to the characterization of RNA interaction with phospholipids. The objective of this work is to investigate the adsorption behavior of short single stranded 10 bases long RNA (ssRNA 10 ) molecules (similar to miRNA) to lipid monolayers at the air-water interface as well as to study how the presence of RNA affect the domain formation in the monolayers using fluorescence microscopy. Monolayer studies have shown adsorption of ssRNA 10 to monolayers consisting of zwitterionic DPPC as well as to monolayers consisting of cationic DODAB. The adsorption behavior of these very short nucleic acids differ significantly from the adsorption process for longer nucleic acids as for example a 2000 base pairs long ds DNA (dsDNA 2000 ) which has been used as a reference system 3 . The presence of ssRNA 10 significantly changes the compression isotherm of both DPPC and DODAB monolayers. Plant defensins are cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides found in various plant species. They share a common threedimensional structure, stabilized by eight disulphide-linked cysteines consisting of three antiparallel \u03b2-strands and one \u03b1-helix. Most plant defensins show antifungal activity with no effect on mammalian and plant cells. Expression of these peptides in plant tissue is induced by pathogen infection. The mechanism of defensin action is based on membrane permeabilization. This occurs through an interaction with high affinity binding sites on fungal membranes, resulting in alteration of membrane potential. The genes encoding for a peach PpDfn1 and a grape VvAMP defensins were expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. They were tested for antimicrobial activity against some fungi and showed to have an inhibitory effect on the spore germination. Biophysical analysis showed that defensins were able to interact with artificial membranes. Binding of defensins to membranes was dependent on lipid composition, increasing with the sphingolipids content. Interaction between peptides and sphingolipids could lead to insertion of the defensins into the membrane resulting in its destabilization. Extracts of the plant Perilla frutescens have many uses in the Asian kitchen, e.g. as a popular garnish used in sushi. The plant is also employed in eastern traditional medicine to treat a variety of ailments including colds, food allergy and depression. Two of the main constituents of the plant are limonene and perilla aldehyde. By bio-oxidation, these molecules can be converted to perillic alcohol and perillic acid. These cyclic terpenes possess antibacterial and anticarcinogenic properties. The modes of action for these compounds are at present not understood, but their remarkably diverse pharmacological properties suggest that they might target the phospholipid matrix of the cellular lipid membrane. Indeed, the cyclic terpenes can bind to, and alter the physiochemical properties of the lipid bilayer of the membrane, the effects of which can cascade down to several essential cellular processes. Here, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the effect of limonene and its derivatives on the properties of lipid bilayers including the changes in acyl chain order parameters, bilayer thickness and the area per lipid. MD can afford molecular-scale dynamic information, often not easily accessible from experimental measurements. This information can be used to interpret existing experimental data obtained by e.g. isothermal titration calorimetry, electron paramagnetic spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry.",

One of the least well understood aspects of the its mechanism is how its activity is regulated by the interaction with the substrate membrane. We have used neutron reflection to monitor changes in membrane structure during lipid hydrolysis [1, 2] . The penetration depth of PLA2 depends on lipid packing and increases during the lag phase of porcine pancreatic PLA2. By using a selectively deuterated lipid substrate, d31-POPC, we determined the relative membrane-water partitioning of the lipid products in-situ. The lyso-lipid product partitions into the solution phase, while fatty acid accumulates in the membrane and increases the affinity of PLA2 [2] . PLA2 is inhibited at pH 5, which is consistent with protonation of the catalytic histidine. However, irrespective of pH, PLA2 is fully activated by Me-betacyclodextrin, which facilitates the release of the lyso-lipid from the enzyme-substrate complex. Me-beta-cyclodextrin does not interact directly with the membrane surface or the substrate lipids, indicating that product release occurs outside the immediate membrane-water interface. Diffraction limits resolution in optical microscopy, but many interesting biological problems occur on shorter (molecular) length scales. Recently, methods to circumvent the diffraction limit have been presented. Fluorescence photoactivation localization microscopy (FPALM) uses activation of many small subsets of photoactivatable or photoswitchable fluorescent probes (PAFPs) to generate images with effective resolution in the tens of nanometers. PAFP molecules are photoactivated, imaged, localized, and photobleached in small numbers. The process is repeated for many subsets to build up data on thousands to many hundreds of thousands of molecules. The positions of all localized molecules are used to construct an image of the sample with resolution limited not by diffraction, but by the localization precision and molecular density. Results will be shown from a variety of biological systems, including live and fixed cells expressing a variety of PAFP-tagged proteins. Bi-plane FPALM can image in three dimensions with demonstrated resolution of 30 nm x 30 nm x 70 nm. Polarization FPALM can image both molecular positions and anisotropies simultaneously with lateral resolution of \u223c20-30 nm. Using these powerful capabilities, many potentially interesting biological problems can be addressed.",

Two main features of NC's chaperone activity are its abilities to aggregate and destabilize nucleic acids. In addition, the rapid kinetics of NCp7 interaction with nucleic acids was recently proposed as another major component of NC's chaperone function based on the apparent correlation between an indirect measurement of the nucleic acid dissociation kinetics of NCp7 and its overall chaperone activity. But so far, no direct measurement of the on/off rates of NCp7 binding to oligonucleotides was performed. In the present work, we realized single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) measurements to probe the transient interactions of a TMR-labelled NCp7 with a short Cy5-labelled DNA oligonucleotide confined into nanovesicles. After confirming the efficiency of the NCp7/ODN complex encapsulation into the nanovesicles by FCS, the vesicles were tethered to the surface for immobilization. Integrity of the entrapping vesicles attached on the surface was confirmed by AFM.

On monocytes, LFA-1 plays a key role in the regulation of monocyte-endothelial interaction during rolling, arrest and extravasation into the underlying tissue. I n-vivo experiments showed that blood borne lymphocytes can 'switch' within seconds from rolling to arrest. Furthermore, TEM observations of pro-active, ligandindependent nanoclusters confirmed that affinity and clustering are complementary processes required in adhesion. Yet, the mechanisms leading to fast-switching remain obscure. In our group, we used a combination of single molecule fluorescence techniques to study the spatiotemporal organization of LFA-1 on monocytes. We performed optical nanoimaging of LFA-1 nanoclusters in relation to membrane rafts with a resolution of 70nm and accuracy of \u223c3nm. In quiescent cells, LFA-1 nanoclusters do not associate with membrane rafts and diffuse freely on the membrane. Binding of the integrin to its ligand ICAM-1 induces the formation of microclusters that further associate with rafts and exhibit reduced mobility, consistent with cytoskeleton interactions.

The mechanism of the membrane translocation is still under investigation and object of considerable controversy. We applied and single-molecule and confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM) to study peptide-membrane interactions. Electron-multiplying CCD cameras yield images of single fluorescent molecules with a time resolution in the range of a few milliseconds only, which allows the tracking of fluorescently labelled peptides and lipids at bio-interfaces in realtime with a localization precision of a few nanometers. We formed giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) from different lipid mixtures and examined their interaction with fluorescently labeled TAT peptides. We found that the passive peptide internalization process depends on lipid composition, charge of the lipid bilayer, and the ionic properties of the medium. A translocation of cationic TAT peptides was observed in membranes containing at least 20 mol% of lipids with a phosphatidyl ethanolamine or a high mol fraction of the phosphatidyl serine head group. In salt-free solution TAT efficiently bound to GUVs, however, in a physiological NaCl solution TAT binding was completely abrogated, but the peptides efficiently equilibrated across the GUV membrane.",

Sch\u00fctz Biophysics Institute, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria In my lecture, I will show examples how to obtain insights into the organization of the cellular Nanocosm by single molecule experiments. Our primary goal is an understanding of the role of such structures for immune recognition. Brightness and single molecule colocalization analysis allows us to study stable or transient molecular associations in vivo. In particular, I will present results on the interaction between antigen-loaded MHC and the T cell receptor directly in the interface region of a T cell with a surrogate antigenpresenting cell. In addition, we developed a method for in vivo micropatterning of plasma membrane proteins to measure molecular interactions. The method allows identifying and characterizing interactions between an arbitrary fluorescence labeled protein (\"prey\") and a membrane protein (\"bait\") directly in living cells. Cells transfected with a fluorescent fusion protein of the prey are plated on micropatterned surfaces functionalized with specific antibodies to the extracellular domain of the bait; the fluorescence copatterning is used as readout for the interaction. We applied this tool for the study of the interaction between CD4 -the major coreceptor for T cell activation -and Lck, an important tyrosine kinase in early T cell signaling. In addition to the well-known zinc-clasp structure, we found strong contributions of Lck membrane anchorage for the binding of the two proteins.",

It combines a fluorescent fragment with a redox-active unit that senses the media by a redox reaction and controls the light emitting properties of the fluorophore. Such reversible sensor can help to examine the electrochemical state and changes in biological systems during biochemical processes in real time. Recently a new fluorescent molecular sensor with a redox-active hydroquinoneunit covalently linked to fluorophore Rhodamine B was developed. (Kierat R.M. et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem.

Although the above method shows great promise for applications in biological systems, the exact mechanism of this process is not fully understood yet. We use fluorescence spectroscopy to investigate oxidation reactions on the ensemble and single-molecule level and study kinetic rates. The proposed strategy is to use Cu (II) complex as oxidation mediator immobilized on surface via DNA linker to examine the oxidation mechanism.",

The binding of Bodipy-ATP to mitochondria was maximal in the non-energized state, whereas the addition of succinate (respiratoty substrate) or atractyloside (adenine nucleotide translocase inhibitor) led to a decrease in the binding. NADH reduced the FCS signal from Bodipy-ATP added to non-energized mitochondria more than NAD+ did under the same conditions suggesting the control of nucleotide transport through voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) residing in the outer membrane. Konig's polyanion also decreased the Bodipy-ATP binding to mitochondria with the effect being reduced by alamethicin or digitonin. Control experiments showed that Bodipy-ATP did not bind to liposomes showing minor role of unspecific binding.

In addition, it has been recently reported that membranes containing negatively-charged phospholipids can also trigger rapid amyloid-like fiber formation by a variety of several nonamyloidogenic proteins, such as cytochrome c and lysozyme [2] . Our study aims to elucidate the factors that govern the formation of these lipid-protein complexes. Given the importance of electrostatic interactions between the proteins and the acidic phospholipids in the putative membrane-induced protein misfolding step, it is essential to first characterize quantitatively the protein partition behavior towards liposomes prepared with variable anionic lipid content. In this study, lysozyme was chosen as a model protein and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) was used to monitor its binding to liposomes after its conjugation to Alexa Fluor 488. Most organic dyes labelling techniques produce a mixture of populations of molecules labelled with a different number of fluorophores. The influence of this poli-dispersity of labelled molecules on the protein partition behaviour will be explored, namely the ability of the FCS technique to detect the production of non-competent membrane-binding species.

Sch\u00fctz Biophysics Institute, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Altenbergerstr.69, A-4040 Linz, Austria There is increasing interest in a detailed understanding of the structure and dynamics of the cellular plasma membrane, primarily based on recognizing its essential role for controlling cellular signaling processes. We employed single molecule fluorescence microscopy to study diffusion of CD59, a GPI-anchored protein, in the plasma membrane of living T24 cells at sub-wavelength resolution, both on the cell body and on tunneling nanotubules connecting cells. The lateral motion of this single fluorescence labeled molecule was imaged on a millisecond time scale. Within the experimental errors, no indications for confined diffusion for CD59 on the cell body in T24 cells have been found. Furthermore by separating longitudinal and transversal mobility, we found isotropic diffusion behavior on the surface of tunneling nanotubules. In both studies we analyzed the mean square displacement as a function of the time-lag and the distribution of displacement steps. However, a closed analytical theory for these analysis is only available for the simplest models. To address a suspected diffusion process we reasoned that a full analytical description may not be required; it may well be sufficient to compare the experimental data with Monte Carlo simulations of the process. We demonstrated the working principle for this simulation based analysis for free diffusion, hop diffusion and transient binding of the tracer molecule to slowly moving receptors.",

Samor\u00ec 1 1 Istituto di Biochimica G.Moruzzi, Universit\u00e0 di Bologna (Italy), 2 Dipartimento di Biologia, Universit\u00e0 di Padova (Italy) Alpha-synuclein (aSyn) is an abundant Intrinsically Disordered Protein (IDP) primarily located at presynaptic terminals. Mutations in the gene encoding aSyn have been linked to early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). By means of single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) experiment, we show how the conformational equilibrium of monomeric wild type (WT) aSyn shifts toward more compact structures in several unrelated conditions linked to PD pathogenicity [1] . The conformational heterogeneity of pathological alpha-Syn mutants A30P, A53T and E46K has also been characterized, revealing marked differences in the conformational behaviors of the mutants with respect to WT aSyn [2] . All the mutants show a distinctively higher propensity, with respect to WT, to acquire a monomeric compact conformation that is compatible with the acquiring of beta structure. The same SMFS experimental methodology is then used to characterize the conformational behavior of WT and mutant aSyn in a variety of conditions, in an attempt to gain insight about the multiple and contrasting parameters controlling the equilibrium. In vitro protein folding studies using chemical denaturants have contributed tremendously to our understanding of the folding thermodynamics and kinetics of water-soluble proteins. This is not the case for integral membrane proteins, which constitute about one third of all eukaryotic proteins and more than half of all validated and potential drug targets. Fully reversible denaturant-induced unfolding remains limited to a few \u03b2-barrel porins, whereas the much larger and more relevant class of \u03b1-helical membrane proteins has thus far evaded this approach. We report here the first example of an \u03b1-helical membrane protein that can be unfolded completely and reversibly by a chemical denaturant: Mistic, a 110-residue protein from Bacillus subtilis [1] , dissociates from detergent micelles or lipid vesicles and assumes an unfolded monomeric state on titration with urea. Using spectroscopic and microcalorimetric techniques, we exploited this unique property to provide (i) a quantitative comparison of membrane protein stability in different membrane-mimetic systems; (ii) an experimental test of controversial predictions [2] regarding the folding core of Mistic; and (iii) a convenient setup to study the spontaneous, translocon-independent membrane insertion of this unusual membrane protein. The mechanical functioning of biological tissues is important from many viewpoints such as diseases, clothing and even food. The protein collagen makes up the greater part of these tissues, and is remarkable for its many uses in the body, however there are at least two other major components. One of the most interesting properties of these tissues is their non-linear behavior under stress. This behavior is essential to prevent a catastrophic failure such as an aneurysm. At least three major theories have been proposed within the past few years to explain this behavior, but have been impossible to verify. In order to determine a correct description of the mechanical structure of the tissue we have been using cutting edge technological solutions to address the single molecules within the extra cellular matrix. This technique combines optical methods with single molecule force spectroscopy, allowing stiffness measurements over the nanoscale as well as determining the individual protein tensions within the extra cellular matrix. The results show that this method can be used to determine the network properties even in the complicated aortic wall enabling better understanding of disease states, which in this case include Marfan's syndrome and ascending aortic aneurysms.",

This behavior is due to the particular sequence of this peptide which is also responsible of the specific oligomeric aggregation states, found by TEM, during the fibrillization process which are very different from those of Abeta1-42, more prone to fibril formation. In addition Abetapy3-42 is found here to have an inhibitory effect on Abeta1-42 fibrillogenesis, coherently with its known greater infective power. This is an indication of the important role of this peptide in the aggregation process of beta-peptides in Alzheimer disease. The puzzle of the anomalously long denaturation kinetics of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) mutants still is largely unveiled. In this study we have followed the effect of mutation H148G on the stability of GFPMut2 (Mut2G) in the presence of guanidinium hydrochloride (GdnHCl). Different techniques of fluorescence spectroscopy have been employed in order to obtain information concerning the unfolding event: time resolved fluorescence, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), and fluorescence anisotropy. The substitution of the histidine with glycine affects protein stability versus pH: in particular Mut2G kinetics is not pH dependent and at basic pH values the protein is less stable. The fluorescence properties (quantum yield, lifetime) and the rotational correlation time are unchanged during the unfolding dynamics, while the number of fluorescent proteins decreases exponentially. An extrinsic probe, bound to cysteine 48, has been employed in order to gain more insights on the unfolding process, monitoring the stability of a different region of the protein. In particular, it has been found that a softer region is present around cysteine 48 in both GFP variants, showing that the unfolding process does not follow a simple two step mechanism. Recently, negatively-charged membranes were reported to catalyze amyloid fiber formation by amyloidogenic peptides/proteins and also to induce formation of \"amyloidlike\" fibrils by nonamyloidogenic proteins. Here, we used an approach which combines steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements to obtain structural information about these supramolecular assemblies and to gain insights about the factors that control their formation. By exploring a wide range of lipid concentrations, the interaction of Alexa488-lysozyme with phosphatidylserine-containing membranes was found to be a complex multi-step process, critically dependent upon the protein-to-lipid molar ratio (P/L) used. Upon increasing the total lipid concentration in solution, there was a balance between an increased overall protein binding to the lipid vesicles and a progressive protein dilution on the membrane surface. As the surface potential of the vesicles decreased upon increasing the protein interfacial coverage of the liposomes, the protein binding mode was found to switch from a peripheral binding of lysozyme to the anionic headgroups (at low to intermediate P/L) to a partial insertion of the basic protein into the hydrophobic core of the membrane (at a high P/L). It is hypothesized that disruption of the protein tertiary structure might be a stepwise process beginning with loosening of the structure caused by its deeper insertion in the membrane bilayer.",

We aim to understand how the structure and topology of a protein affect its resilience to external forces and presumably its function. Owing to recent advances in single molecule force-clamp spectroscopy using the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), we are now able to probe the structure and dynamics of single proteins under a constant stretching force by measuring their end-to-end length over time. The probability distribution of unfolding times at a given force allows us to estimate the strength of the protein in terms of a characteristic energy barrier, while the shape of the distribution provides a window into the microscopic mechanism by which the protein breaks apart. Here we show a novel scaling of the unfolding kinetics with the stretching force, which deviates significantly from the currently accepted Bell model.

Therefore, nature has developed a series of lipid transfer proteins such as the cholesterylester transfer protein (CETP) designed to efficiently lower the energy barrier for transfer of cholesterol-esters between lipoproteins through an aqueous environment. Employing circular dichroism we evaluated the secondary structure stability of a small peptide derived from the carboxy-end of CETP (Helix Y ) in a wide range of pH's. The percentage of \u03b1-helix is diminished only at extreme temperatures and acidic pH's in a reversible way. We report that while a mixture of phosphatidylcholine/cholesteryl-ester forms large aggregated particles independently of pH, inclusion of helix Y to the mixtures close to neutral pH's allows the formation of small micellar-like structures confirmed by dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy. These results suggest that helix Y when close to physiological pH values presents the ability to organize a micellar structure around itself. This type of organization allows the process to dramatically lower the energetic barrier for lipid transfer through aqueous media, phenomenon directly related with the facilitation of lipid transfer between lipoproteins.",

The discovery of practical and effective treatments and drugs for AD has been waited eagerly. In a recent experimental study, it was suggested that stabilization of the helical conformation of the A\u03b2 middle region, which strongly favors collapsed coil formation in the extracellular environment, would reduce the A\u03b2 fibril formation. Based on the experimental evidence, inhibition of the unfolding of the A\u03b2 \u03b1-helix can be a forceful strategy to repress the A\u03b2 fibril formation resulting in prevention of AD. However, the detailed mechanism of the unfolding of the A\u03b2 \u03b1-helix has remained unclear, because the X-ray or the NMR structure of the A\u03b2 \u03b1-helix in aqueous solution has not been reported due to its instability. The aim of this study is to find effective ways to inhibit the unfolding of the A\u03b2 middle region, which is a prerequisite for the A\u03b2 fibril formation. In this study, we attempted to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the A\u03b2 unfolding by molecular modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

In this study we used two different procedures, the SOSUIdumbbell algorithm and a novel procedure that is based on the linker average hydrophilicity (LAH). The two procedures were tested on 17 known-structure CaBPs and then applied to 59 unknown-structure centrins. The SO-SUIdumbbell algorithm yielded the right conformations for 15 of the 17 known-structure proteins and predicted that all centrins should are compact. The LAH procedure discriminated well between the extended and non-extended forms of all the known-structure CaBPs and it reflected well the phylogenetic classification of centrins being a simple and powerful means to discriminate between extended and nonextended forms of CaBPs.

Fluorescence quenching and time-resolved fluorescence experiments showed that the fluorescence signal is largely dominated by the Trp residues at the protein surface. Moreover, time-resolved anisotropy measurements indicate that the protein motion is restricted and that the surface Trp residues exhibit both local and segmental motions. The lipid part of the particles has been studied by environment sensitive 3-hydroxyflavone probes and viscosity-sensitive DPHbased probes, and compared to lipid bilayers and low density lipoproteins (LDLs), taken as models. The results suggest that the lipid part of HBsAg is closer to LDLs than to model lipid bilayers. We present an extensive calorimetric study of bovine alphalactalbumin for various Ca++ content. Equilibrium DSC raw data are analyzed and the melting temperature Tm, the specific heat jump DeltaCp, the heat of unfolding DeltaHm are directly extracted. The binding of calcium on the native (N) state greatly stabilizes the protein, essentially by the enthalpic difference between the unfolded (U) and N states.

ProIAPP is co-processed in the secretory granules and co-secreted to the extracellular matrix together with insulin as IAPP. Here, we compare the amyloidogenic and conformational properties of proIAPP and IAPP in the presence of lipid membranes, which have been discussed as loci of initiation of the fibrillation reaction. The two peptides show an enhanced amyloidogenic propensity in the presence of negatively charged membranes and similar secondary structural properties. However, proIAPP shows a much less amyloidogenic propensity, probably due to the increased net charge on proIAPP, compared to IAPP. Unlike IAPP, proIAPP forms small oligomeric structures at the lipid interface, having heights of \u223c3.5 nm. This morphological distinction can be attributed to the presence of the pro-region, flanking the amyloidogenic IAPP. The addition of proIAPP to IAPP marginally delays IAPP fibrillation, probably by interfering with the interaction between amyloidogenic IAPP cores of distinct IAPP molecules. Thus, it appears reasonable to speculate that the pro-region of the proIAPP could serve to delay the fibrillogenesis of IAPP at negatively charged lipid bilayers.",

CPT 1 controls the rate of entry of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix for \u03b2oxidation. The two catalytically active isoforms, CPT 1A and CPT 1B, are different in their inhibitor binding kinetics and structure (interaction between N-and C-segments, interactions of transmembrane domains (TMD)). It has been suggested that inter-and intramolecular TMDs interactions are important for CPT 1A, but not for CPT 1B function. CPT 1A has also been implicated in formation of oligomeric complexes through its TM segments. The study of TM helix-helix interactions in CPT 1 isoforms could lead to a better understanding of their function and inhibitor binding kinetics, and will contribute towards the design of pharmacological strategies aimed at modulating the activities of CPT 1 enzymes in conditions such as diabetes. To investigate the ability of the TMD in CPT 1 to self-associate and the order of any oligomers formed, several biochemical and biophysical techniques have been used. We found the self-association of rCPT 1A TMDs (TM1, TM2) to be different as measured using the in vivo TOX-CAT assay. Chemical cross-linking and analytical ultracentrifugation studies demonstrated formation of both trimers and hexamers by the rCPT 1A TM2 peptide.

We have investigated full-length CPT1A and find that the protein exists as a hexamer in liver mitochondria. Using mutants of CPT1A expressed in yeast mitochondria, we have localised key protein interactions in the hexamer to the transmembrane (TM) domains of the protein. Detailed study of the TM domains in isolation, in both E.Coli membranes and detergent micelles, demonstrated that while TM1 shows little self-assembly, TM2 displayed significant self-association. Biophysical analyses of a TM2-derived synthetic peptide revealed oligomerization behaviour identical to native CPT1A in mitochondria, providing a strong link between TM2 helixhelix interactions and CPT1A hexamer formation. This is significant in light of a recent suggestion that CPT1A oligomerization may lead to formation of a channel in the mitochondrial outer membrane through which acylcarnitine gains access to the inter-membrane space. Our data supports this new theory, and we go on to demonstrate experimentally the structural determinants of hexamer (channel) formation, specifically GXXXG(A) motifs in the TM domain which pack favourably in the hexamer and stabilize the oligomer.",

IR techniques provide both the necessary time resolution as well as the structural sensitivity. We initiate rapid heating by laser-excited ns temperature jumps (\u223c10 \u2022 C) and study fast ns-to-\u00b5s relaxation dynamics [1] . The dynamics of the \u03b1-helix to random coil transition of polyglutamic acid was analyzed under reversible folding/refolding pH-conditions. The observed relaxation kinetics allowed separation of the folding and unfolding process with additional use of FTIR measurements in thermal equilibrium. Sitespecific dynamics were monitored by use of isotopic labeling for a \u03b2-hairpin peptide whose conformation is stabilized by a hydrophobic core. Various single and cross-strand isotopically labeled variants were analyzed. The isotope-edited kinetics show variations in local structural stability of the hairpin backbone. Our data support a multistate dynamic behavior, and the site-specific kinetics are consistent with a hydrophobic collapse hypothesis for hairpin folding [2] . Small heat shock protein Hsp22 was predicted to belong to the family of intrinsically disordered proteins. One of the features of these proteins is that they do not demonstrate cooperative thermal transitions on heating. We applied different methods (DSC, FTIR and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence) to investigate the thermal unfolding of Hsp22. DSC results have shown that thermal denaturation of Hsp22 begins from 25 o C and occurs, with very low cooperativity, within a broad temperature region (up to 80 o C and above). The thermal unfolding of Hsp22 is fully reversible. The FTIR data show that heating of Hsp22 from 20 to 70 o C results in complete disappearance of \u03b1-helices (from 8-12% to 0) and the decrease in \u03b2-sheets content from 42 to 30%. Studies on the temperature dependences of tryptophan fluorescence have shown a significant red shift of the spectrum. These changes occurred within temperature region from 30 to 80 o C with midpoint at \u223c56 o C. Probably, this transition can be explained by destruction of \u03b2-sheets around Trp96, the only Trp residue of the \u03b1-crystallin domain of Hsp22 (other 3 Trp residues of Hsp22 are localized in the N-terminal domain). The data obtained confirm the suggestion that Hsp22 is a protein, whose significant part is intrinsically disordered. We propose that, on heating, the \u03b1-crystallin domain containing \u03b2-sheets melts at higher temperature than the N-terminal domain containing the most of \u03b1-helices.",

A major goal of this study is to investigate polymeric vesicles with respect to their suitability for protein folding studies [1] . Polymer vesicles maintain their structural integrity even under harsh unfolding conditions. Furthermore the nanocontainer proved to be permeable to guanidinium hydrochloride. Using encapsulated phoshoglycerate kinase, labeled with ATTO-655, a dye which experiences fluorescence quenching by photo-induced electron transfer (PET) with tryptophans, we demonstrate the remarkable properties of polymeric nanocontainers. Applying PET as a folding probe we detected multiple unfolding/refolding transitions of single proteins. Proteins frequently become irreversibly modified by carbonylation, a process of introducing the carbonyl group (carbon monoxide) in a reaction with reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide, peroxide or ozone. The main targets for carbonylation in proteins are amino-acid side chains of lysine, arginine and proline. Products of carbonylation are aminoadipic semialdehyde from lysine (ASA) and glutamic semialdehyde (GSA) from arginine and proline. Importantly, carbonylated proteins are marked for proteolysis by the proteasome, but can escape degradation and form aggregates that can be cytotoxic. Carbonylation increases with the age of cells and it is associated with ageing and age related disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and cancer. We have used the molecular dynamics method to study the stability of carbonylated proteins villin headpiece and ubiquitin. Simulations were run after mutations of arginine, proline and lysine into GSA and ASA had been performed. In addition, we have used thermodynamic integration on lysine, arginine, proline, ASA and GSA residues in order to estimate their solvation free energy (related to relative hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity). Our results suggest that carbonylation markedly decreases the overall stability of proteins, and that one potential reason for that may be a disruption of the balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions in the protein.",

Clinical batches of a C-term deleted form of NadA (Genome-derived Neisseria Antigen -GNA1994) and the fusion proteins GNA2132-1030 (FP-1) and GNA2091-1870 (FP-2) were therefore studied. Increases in temperature and denaturant concentration on secondary structures and folding/unfolding profile were monitored by CD in the far and near UV regions and complemented by Trp fluorescence spectroscopy data. Furthermore, epitope conformational changes on binding activities to immune-sera were investigated. The calculated secondary structure content was in broad agreement with the available predicted or solved protein structures. Upon temperature incubation, a structural transition from a highly \u03b1-helical NadA to a more unordered conformation, with a mid point at \u223c40 \u2022 C, was observed. FP-1 and FP-2 maintained their conformation up to 50 \u2022 C or 6M GuHCl in the case of FP-1. Unfolding was not always reversible. Reductions in binding to monoclonal Ab titrated along with increasing unfolding. Folding/unfolding studies have proven useful in better understanding the solution behaviour and extent of folding of proteins.",

Here we present a study of the effects of alcohols on protein stability using Yfh1. Exploiting the unusual property of this protein of undergoing cold denaturation around 0 \u2022 C without any ad hoc destabilization, we determined the stability curve on the basis of both high and low temperature unfolding in the presence of three commonly used alcohols: trifluoroethanol,ethanol methanol. In all cases, we observed an extended temperature range of protein stability as determined by a modest increase of the high temperature of unfolding but an appreciable decrease in the low temperature of unfolding. We suggest that alcohols, at low concentration and physiological pH, stabilize proteins by greatly widening the range of temperatures over which the protein is stable. Our results also clarify the molecular mechanism of the interaction and validate the current theoretical interpretation of the mechanism of cold denaturation.",

Jenei Department of Biophysics, University of Debrecen, Nagyerdei krt. 98, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary Receptor clustering and changes in their cell surface distribution have often pivotal role in the ligand receptor interactions. HLA I and II have a key role in the immune response since they display fragmented pieces of an antigen on the host cell's surface. Previous studies indicated a non-random distribution of HLA I molecules on the cell surface. In present study we analyzed the role of individual molecules on the pattern formation of HLA I. We have established a stable transfected HLA II-deficient BLS-1 human B cell line expressing HLA-DQ6 and determined the expression levels of HLA-DQ6, HLA I, HLA II and ICAM 1 proteins. On HLA-DQ6 transfected cells expression of HLA I decreased. Homo-and heteroassociations of HLA I, HLA II and ICAM 1 molecules were assessed on EBVtransformed lymphoblast JY, BLS-1 human B and HLA-DQ6 transfected BLS-1 cell lines by flow and image cytometric FRET methods. No notable difference was found in the heteroassociation of ICAM 1 with HLA I and HLA II on JY and HLA-DQ6 transfected cells. However, HLA-DQ6 nucleofected BLS-1 showed significant decrease in energy transfer efficiency between HLA I and HLA II antigens (using HLA I as donor and HLA II as acceptor, and vice versa). Homoassociation of HLA I also decreased significantly on transfected BLS-1 cells. These findings indicate that HLA-II influences the distribution of other cell surface receptors.

Gulbins 2 1 Department of Biology, University of Padova, Italy, 2 Department of Molecular Biology, University of Essen, Germany, 3 Department of Physiology, University of Tuebingen, Germany, 4 CNR Institute of Neuroscience, Padova, Italy Voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.3, the major plasma membrane channel in lymphocytes (Chandy et al, 2004 Trends Pharm. Sci., 25, 280), has been located also to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Lymphocytes genetically deficient for Kv1.3 or transfected with siRNA suppressing Kv1.3-expression resisted apoptosis induced by several stimuli, while retransfection of Kv1.3 restored death. Proapoptotic Bax directly interacted with and functionally inhibited Kv1.3. Incubation of isolated mitochondria with recombinant Bax or channel inhibiting toxins triggered hyperpolarization, formation of reactive oxygen species, release of cytochrome c and depolarization. Mutation of Bax at K128, which corresponds to a conserved lysine in Kv1.3-inhibiting toxins, abrogated its effects on Kv1.3 and mitochondria (Szab\u00f2 et al, 2008 PNAS 105, 14861). Likewise, a single point mutation turned Bcl-xL pro-apoptoptic. To test the function of the mutant Bax in vivo, Bax \u2212/\u2212 Bak \u2212/\u2212 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (DKO MEFs) were transfected with either wild type Bax or Bax(K128E). Staurosporine-induced apoptosis was defective in Bax(K128E)-transfected cells, indicating that Bax mediates apoptosis in lymphocytes at least in part via interaction with mitochondrial Kv1.3.",

There are NMR structure data about the lipidated membrane anchor of N-Ras and H-Ras and studies about membrane interaction of lipidated H-Ras. In order to identify the interaction domains of N-Ras with the membrane, we performed 40ns-MD simulations of lipidated N-RasGDP and N-RasGTP bound to a POPC membrane. The starting structures base on a homology model of the crystalstructures of H-RasGDP (PDB-ID: 1QRA) and H-RasGTP (4Q21). NMR data from Reuther et al. was used for modelling of the membrane-anchor region. The minimum distance of the G-domain to the membrane is about 11\u00c5 in the starting structure. During the simulation it attaches stable to the membrane. The identified interaction domains are the \u03b22-\u03b23 loop (D47), the helix \u03b14 (K128 and K 135) and the helix \u03b15. No differences occur in the interaction domains between the GTP and GDP bound state during the simulations in contrast to the results of Gorfe et al. for H-Ras. The secondary structure of the N-Ras G-Domain is stable during the 40ns-MD simulations and does not differ from the secondary one of MD simulations for N-Ras without membrane.

Martins 2 1 IBB (Institute for Biotechnology and Bioengineering) -CBME (Center for Molecular and Structural Biomedicine), 2 DQBF -FCT, Universidade do Algarve, Faro, Portugal Phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins and cholesterol are major constituents of biological plasmatic membranes. As we mix this sterol into pure phospholipid bilayers, there are some important changes in the fluidity and polarity gradients, that depend on the chemical composition as well as on other thermodynamic parameters (e.g. temperature, pressure) [D.Arrais, J.Martins (2007) Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1768:2914-2922]. The variation of one or more of these parameters leads us to significant differences in water permeability, bilayer thickness and molecular packing (reducing the conformational freedom of phospholipid acyl chains and the lipid lateral diffusion).Using the Py empirical polarity scale, we have studied the polarity properties of pure POPC and egg-sphingomyelin and of specific compositions in POPC/cholesterol and egg-sphingomyelin/cholesterol mixtures. With increasing cholesterol molar proportions, the polarity values for POPC decrease and we can observe a behavior similar as for homogeneous polar solvents. For egg-sphingomyelin, there is an increase in the polarity values in parallel with augmenting cholesterol concentration and the results show no relation to the thermal behavior of homogeneous solvents.

Inst., Diepenbeek, Belgium, 2 Medische Beeldvorming, Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg campus Sint-Jan, Genk, Belgium Raster Image Correlation Spectroscopy (RICS) allows for mapping local translational diffusion coefficient(s) D. RICS applicability was recently extended to confocal laser scanning microscopes (CLSM) equipped with one-photon laser excitation and analog detection [Brown C. et al J. Microsc. 2008, Gielen E. et al Langmuir 2009]. To better understand the reproducibility and accuracy of RICS analysis of the top membranes of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUV) and cellular membranes, the influence and the constraints imposed by instrumentation and samples on the retrieved D values was simulated similar to Brown C. et al. The dependence of the parameter recovery on scan speed choice and detection noise, and on the total number of particles and mapping brick size was explored. Experiments show that in our Zeiss LSM 510 META CLSM the correlated detection noise along the fast x-scan axis (\u03c8= 0) is considerably larger than reported for other CLSMs. Near the GUV perimeter a drop in mapped D-values occurs. RICS (LFD, UCI, USA) and our Matlab software gave similar simulation and D mapping results.

Garcia-Parajo Bionanophotonics group, IBEC-Institut de Bioenginyeria de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain Membrane proteins play a fundamental role in intra-and inter-cellular functions. In particular, the proteins lateral mobility in the fluid membrane environment is crucial for the regulation of several mechanisms, as receptor-mediated signal transduction and establishment of immunological synapses. These mechanisms are controlled through protein crowding and reduced lateral diffusion, which induce macromolecular associations and limit the application of conventional single molecule fluorescence techniques. To measure proteins mobility on living cells membrane, we developed a fluorescent correlation spectroscopy (FCS) setup in which the sample illumination is obtained through near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) probes. The use of NSOM probes is particularly suited for the observation of dynamics on the cell membrane and overcomes the drawbacks of other techniques. In fact, through a shear-force-based position control, the probe is kept at a fixed distance from the membrane and its sub-wavelength aperture (\u223c100 nm) reduces the illumination area, allowing the observation of highly crowded regions of the membrane. On the basis of preliminary results, the NSOM-FCS is expected to provide an additional insight on the proteins trafficking at the membrane level. The technique also presents several potential developments, as the further reduction of the illumination area and two-colors correlation.",

The essential pore forming subunit of SOCE channels in the plasma membrane is Orai1. Here we present single molecule fluorescence microscopy of Orai1 which was performed in order to directly visualize the stoichiometry of mobile Orai1 pores. The protein was fluorescently labeled with monomeric GFP. A novel single molecule fluorescence approach, TOCCSL (Thinning Out Clusters while Conserving the Stoichiometry of Labeling), was used for the determination of the stoichiometry. This technique allows reducing the density of fluorescently labeled molecules without affecting the stoichiometry of labeling. Density reduction is achieved by completely photobleaching a defined area within the plasma membrane; nonbleached GFP-Orai1 aggregates enter the bleached region subsequently by diffusion. Our data indicate that there are different populations of Orai1 present in the cell: Most of Orai1 is located in the plasma membrane. A second population of Orai1-mGFP was found to be localized in intracellular vesicles. A significant fraction of the plasma membrane Orai1 exhibits a diffusive movement.

Ribozymes are a class of RNA molecules capable of catalyzing chemical reactions. We have studied a Diels-Alderase (DAse) ribozyme, a small artificial 49-mer ribozyme, which is capable of catalyzing carbon-carbon bond formation between an anthracene diene and a maleimide dienophile in multiple turnovers. Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer was employed to investigate the intramolecular dynamics of this RNA molecule as a function of Mg 2+ ion concentration. Folding into a functional state occurs via an intermediate state, and continuous fluctuations between these two states were observed on the 100ms time-scale at the midpoint concentration of Mg 2+ ions. An effect of substrates binding on the folding and catalytic reaction of the DAse ribozyme is in the focus of our recent research with the ultimate goal to obtain a detailed structural view of the single-molecule conformational changes that accompany the catalytic reaction.",

Numerous studies showed that protein folding and maturation can differ substantially between de novo synthesized proteins and in vitro refolded proteins. Here we present an approach employing a two color single molecule sensitive fluorescence wide-field microscope in order to visualize surface tethered fluorescently labeled ribosomes and de novo synthesized GFP molecules in real time [1] . Fluorescence of co-translational folded proteins was observed from mature fluorescent GFP molecules which carry 31 additional amino acids at the C terminus remaining linked to the ribosome. Thus it was possible to co-localize fluorescence from labeled ribosomes and from GFP molecules. We demonstrate that the green fluorescence protein mutant GFP Emerald is produced with a characteristic time of five minutes. The fastest GFP molecules appeared already within one minute. Processes precedent to chromophore formation, such as polypeptide synthesis and protein folding, are fast and last not longer than one minute. In fluorescence spectroscopy, photobleaching is a process which leads to irreversible loss of fluorescent properties of a dye molecule, usually due to photochemical reactions. It is especially important for FCS experiments on slow-diffusion systems since for high excitation intensities it can have a strong impact on fluorescence intensity correlation function. Usually it is observed as apparent shortening of the mean diffusion time of the dye molecules. The behavior of TMR-labeled fd-virus rods in water solution under various excitation conditions was investigated. The experiments were conducted for low (1:1) and high (625:1) TMR:virus ratios and for increasing laser intensities. The correlation function was measured in the experiments. The results were fitted using Origin software to estimate the influence of photobleaching, and compared with computer simulations. A strong effect of photobleaching was visible for rods labeled with a single dye molecule, while rods labeled with 625 TMR molecules showed little to no bleaching. A prolongation of characteristic diffusion times for highly labeled virus rods in comparison to low-labeled ones was also observed.",

NK cells are critical mediators of anti-viral immunity and protectors against cancer spread. Their activity is governed by a fine-tuned balance between inhibitory and activating receptors, where Ly49A and KIR receptors represents the inhibitory ones. Their ligands are MHC class I receptors.

The technique offers information about molecular dynamics at the single molecular level, in the nanosecond to millisecond range. Dual color FCCS expands FCS by correlating the intensity from two different colors.

This allowed us to establish the presence of nanoscale confining structures 1 and to demonstrate their implication in signaling process 2 . Complementing these studies, we present here a new analytical method, namely multiple-target tracing (MTT) 3 which takes advantage of the high resolution provided by singlemolecule sensitivity to generate dynamic maps at high densities of tracked particles. Introducing deflation by subtracting detected peaks allows detecting peaks of lower intensity. We achieved an exhaustive detection of particles with performances reaching theoretical limits, and a reconnection of trajectories integrating the statistical information from past trajectories. We demonstrate the potential of this new method of analysis by applying it to the epidermal growth factor receptor labeled with quantum dots, in the plasma membrane of live cells. This has allowed us to build up a global representation of molecular dynamics in cell membranes. Dual Polarisation Interferometry (DPI) is a surface analytical technique capable of dynamically measuring biophysical parameters of conformational change in biomolecular interactions. The technique measures three key parameters, namely layer thickness, layer density (RI) and mass, thereby enabling the resolution of conformational changes involved during binding. A number of different applications are presented. Protein-protein interactions: Understanding the biophysical nature of protein interactions can deliver insights into the mechanisms by which proteins interact, thereby elucidating protein function. DPI enables correlation between binding affinity and conformational change, greatly enhancing the study of structure-function relationships. Lipid Layers: The birefringence mode of DPI can be used to study the formation of lipid bilayers and biomolecular self-assembly. It is possible to use a combination of bilayer refringence and mass to study phase transitions associated with protein or peptide binding to the lipid bilayer. The individual stages of adsorption, absorption and micellisation can be distinguished. Carbohydrate Interactions: DPI uses a planar glass surface and a wide range of coupling chemistries. A carbohydratespecific surface can be used to study a wide range of biomolecular interactions, such as lectins, acidic proteins, extracellular matrix signaling and interactions with complex membranes. The experimental characterization of the elementary conformational steps constituting the protein folding pathway remains a big challenge. Quenching of the triplet state of tryptophan by close contact with cysteine has been shown to provide a new tool for measuring the rate of intramolecular contact formation -one of the most elementary events in the folding process -in peptides and proteins using only natural probes. Here we show an extensive study on a stabilized mutant of the second beta-hairpin of GB1 domain. Steady state fluorescence and kinetics of contact formation between a natural tryptophan and a cysteine added to the C-terminal are measured for different temperatures and solvent conditions. We separately address the contributions of different structural elements to the overall stability of the hairpin. We extract kinetics parameter for contact formations in the unfolded state, formation of the hydrophobic core and tails pairing in the folded state. By means of a fragment peptide terminated with a tryptophan and a cysteine, we also estimate the structural propensity of the turn region. The data coherently combine with a simple model previously developed to describe the dynamics of unstructured chain [Biophys. J. 96, 1515 (2009)], here modified with the addition of attractive interactions between specific residues.",

Furthermore, an impact of urea and GuHCl in combination with of temperature on the kinetic pattern of carboxypeptidase A has been examined. For the case of \u03b1-CT, in particular, we have observed about tenfold increase of the apparent Mickaelis constant when going from 0 to 6 M urea (25 o C), whereas the value of catalytic constant remained almost unchanged, indicating that the protein is not unfolded even under those severe conditions. The matching microcalorimetric experiments revealed that both the temperature-induced melting temperature and transition enthalpy decrease gradually with the increase of the additive concentration. With 6 M urea the peak-shaped calorimetric feature disappears totally. However, catalytic power of \u03b1-CT was preserved owing to its catalytic constant. For other studied enzyme/substrate/denaturant arrays diverse kinetic peculiarities due to MGLS have been observed. Rubredoxins are a class of iron-containing proteins whose biological role on electron transfer processes and metal binding is still unclear. The unfolding dynamics of the rubredoxin mutant RdA51C from the mesophile Desulfovibrio vulgaris (Dv) was studied on the temperature range from 25 \u2022 C to 87 \u2022 C and along time at 87 \u2022 C. Resonance Energy Transfer (RET) was used to determine the donor (D; Trp37) to acceptor (A; 1,5-IAEDANS) distance. From 25 \u2022 C to 87 \u2022 C the D-A distance increased 4\u00c5. However the random coil expected D-A distance was only achieved after heating the protein solution during 2.5 hours at 87 \u2022 C. From UV-Vis absorption data it's clear that this protein is capable of maintaining its iron-sulfur center at 90 \u2022 C. By melting the protein at the same temperature all iron-centers disintegrate and the protein unfold after 2.5 hour. The Trp37 fluorescence also shifts 13 nm to the red reflecting the partial exposition of the indole ring to the solvent. From fluorescence and anisotropy decay curves a breathing type movement of the protein structure was observed between 30 \u2022 C to 60 \u2022 C without lost of significant secondary structure. This structure flexibility should play an important role on the thermal stability of the DvRd The antimicrobial peptide Novicidin (Nc) -modified from the sheep self defense peptide SMAP-29, for reduced mammalian cytotoxicity -is a cationic peptide (net charge +\u223c7.5) that adopts random coil structure in solution, but an \u03b1-helix in the presence of lipid vesicles. The conformation of Nc in presence of the lipids DLPC, DLPG, DMPC, DMPG, DOPC, DOPG, DOPE, and DOPS in different combinations reveal the lipid selectivity, affinity, and phase dependent changes with varying L/P ratios and temperatures, observed from CD spectroscopy. It is understood that the conformational change is dependent on chain length and head group of the lipid. Apart from the in vivo results on the Nc activity, studies using QCM-D, Dual Polarisation Interferometry, and Calcein Release Assay reveal the kinetics and concentration dependent activity of Nc in lipid bilayers and vesicles. Preliminary studies on orientation of Nc in various lipid environments using ssNMR, lsNMR, and Molecular Dynamics simulations apparently suggest that Nc may form toroidal pores/detergent effects depending on the chain length of the lipids. Further experiments on Nc in presence of lipids using DSC, ITC, ssNMR, Oriented CD, LD, and confocal microscopy to determine the structure, thermal stability, orientation in lipid bilayers, and thereof the action of Nc will help in proposing a comprehensive model for its mechanism of action in model membranes.",

High frequency dielectric measurements can be used to study the flexibility of proteins by probing the relaxation of dipolar constituents of their structures. Hydrated proteins exhibit a broad dielectric loss extending over the frequency range from 1MHz to 10GHz which can be decomposed into a number of constituent dispersions. One of these dispersions, with a relaxation time of \u223c18ns, has been attributed to the relaxation of protein backbone peptide groups in the protein interior. In the work reported here, this dielectric dispersion was investigated as a function of temperature for the enzyme Glucose Oxidase. Two critical temperatures were identified as the glass transition and denaturation temperatures, both of which were found to decrease with increasing protein water content. The results were consistent with a scheme in which the hydrated glassy protein undergoes a change in structural mobility at the glass transition temperature and experiences an irreversible change in conformation at a higher denaturation temperature. Both glass transition and denaturation temperatures are key indicators of protein stability and are important in the production and storage of protein based pharmaceuticals.",

An interesting problem is to find out in which conditions the interactions of the protein molecules lead to formation of ordered structures and in which to disordered ones. In this study, dynamic light scattering, circular dichroism and also Congo red dye experiments were performed to analyze various structural states of lysozyme induced under different concentration of ethanol solvent. At low ethanol concentration the attractive interaction between the protein macromolecules dominate. After addition of more ethanol solvent, the translational diffusion coefficient was much smaller than that for lysozyme solution at zero ethanol concentration. It can be explained by the structural transformation of the polypeptide chain leading to a partially folded conformation needed for oligomerization and fibrillation process. On the basis of the CD experiments we concluded that the ethanol solvent induces changes in secondary structure of lysozyme solution. On addition of 75% v/v ethanol solution the intramolecular hydrogen bonds were destabilized. Above this ethanol concentration, \u03b2 -sheet were the dominant secondary structure of lysozyme in solution.
