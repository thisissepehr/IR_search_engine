Extramedullary hematopoiesis mayaiso occur in patients with hematopoietic disorders, reflecling the benign variant of tumors 01 granulocytic precursor cells. Material and methods: Computed tomographies (n = 8) or magnetic resonance images (n = 10) 01 lourteen patients were analysed retrospectively. Eight patients had granulocytle sarcoma (GS) . six patienls had extramedullary hematopolesls (EH). T2w-and Tlw-SE belore and after gadopentetate dimeglumine were perlormed In all MR exammatlons.

Patients treated with embolization underwent MR before and aher the procedure. Results: In four cases MRI estabilished the nature of lesions (angioma) and 3D CEMRA demonstrated low flow lesions and lack of arterial feeders.

Among the relapsing patients 12 had proved rnliltration 01 sorrounding pelvic structures Conclusions: MAI is accurate in the evaluation 01 suspected pelvic recurrence 01 rectal carcinoma after surgery. In our experrence MRI IS partlcularly uselul in preoperatlve assessment 01 the inilitration 01 pelvlc structures when surgery IS planned. Purpose: Evaluate the uselulness 01 endorectal ultrasound (EUS) and deline sonographlc entefla to estlmate response to neoadluvant radloehemotherapy 01 rectal cancer. as correct T staglng IS dillicult due to posttherapeutic changes. Methods & materials: 20 patients underwent endoscopy. biopsy. EUS. abdominal CE-CT and ultrasound belore and alter radiochemotherapy. Surgical specimen were worked up histopathologically and hlstopathologic lindings were correlated with EUS. We measured wall/tumor thickness in mm, differentiated relative posttherapeutlc reduction 01 wall thickness in 3 groups (more than 50 %. less than 50 %, no change 01 wall thickness). and change 01 tumor shape (excentric to concentflc. excentric to excentric. concentrrc to concentric) Results: Wall /tumor thickness less than 6 mm comblned wlth relative reduction 01 tumor thlckness . 50 \u00b00 and change 01 tumorshape Irom excentnc to concentnc allowed to diagnose 3 01 5 complete responses. No posilive Iymph-nodes were lound in patients wlth posttherapeutic wallthickness 01 7 mm or less. A sub group 01 non responders (4) could also be dellned. Concluslon: EUS is a uselull tool to evaluate response to radiochemotherapy 01 rectal cancer Purpose: To evaluate the leasibility and clinical application 01 MA-delecography using radial IluoroscoPlc sequences. Methods and material: 10 patients wlth delecation disorders were examlned rn a 1.5 T magnet (ACS-NT. Phrlips) . A condome frlled with a mixture 01 water. starch and diluted gadopentetate dimeglumine (1500) was Inserted into the rectum. The delecatlon process was imaged by a turbo fleld echo sequence with radial kspace tralectones In a sagittal and coronal plane . In order to suppress loldover artilacts, two parallel saturation slabs were placed within the FOV at a distance 01 150 mm. After acquisition 01 a number 01 radial projections which were almost parallel to the REST slabs, th e orientatlol1 01 the slabs was changed to the perpendlcular Oflentatlon and the next prolectlons were acqurred Results: The high temporal resolution allowed precise evaluation 01 the anorectal angle during resting, and contraction 01 the anal sphincter and during straining. Foldover artilacts and artilacts 01 abdominal movement during straining were reduced to aminimum, resulting in a good image quality with high temporal resolution . Recotcele was lound more commonly in group B (39 %). The anorectal angle va lues did differ significantly between the groups. Conelusion: Delecography plays a vitale role in objective demonstration 01 enterocele and associated pelvic lIoor abnormalities. Rectal intussception and prolapse and an increased pelvic lloor descent are olten associated with an enterocele.",

In two patients recurrent cancer was found in (renal pelvis and ureter). Appropriate evaluation of the urinary diversions was achieved (i.e. Bricker's ileal conduit. Boari cystoplasty. Hautmann-, Mainz-neobladder). Conelusion: MA-urography is a good alternative to IVU or retrograde contrast studies to evaluate the collecting system and urinary diversions. MA-urography is suited to evaluate 'Iate' complications , related to the initial pathology (i.e. urothelial malignancy). or related to the operative procedure . An important prerequisite is a good understanding of the surgical procedure . Methods: The gadolinlum-enhanced excretory MA urograms obtained from 35 patients (5 normal; 30 pathologic) were used to reconstruct a virtual ureterorenoscopy (MAUAS/ based on a threshold image segmentation. MA urograms were acquired with Tl-weighted 3D gradient-echo sequences after iv injection of gadolinium-DTPA In combination with low-dose furosemide. Resuhs: The excretory MA urograms provided a complete visualization of the urinary tract with a strong endoluminal contrast-enhancement. The reconstruction of an MAUAS was possible in all 35 patients, even when the collecting system was nondilated . The best anatomic accuracy was obtained from MAU sequences with a very small voxel size (eg. 1 xl xl mm' ).

Inside the renal pelvis, the calices were assessed by turnlng the virtual endoscope in all directions. From the endovesical view, the ureteral orifiees, the trigone, and the urethra eould also be visualized. All filling defects diagnosed by MAU eould be evaluated endoscopieally using MAUAS.

Materials and methods: Two experimental models of nephropathies were studied: a model 01 nephrotoxic nephritis induced by intravenous injection of sheep anti-rat glomerular basal membrane serum (anli-GBM GN, n = 44) and a model of obstruclive nephropathy (n = 6) . Imaging sessions were performad on a spectrometer operating at 4.7 T using FLASH sequences. Signal Intensity was measured in each kidney compartment before and 24 h after intravenous injection of 90 IJmol of USPIO. MA findings were compared with histological data and urine proteins. Results: In the anti-GBM GN model. 24 hours after injection of USPIO. a signilicant signal drop (p 0.05) was present only in the cortex where glomerular lesions were located. In the hydronephrosls model, the Signal drop (p . 0.05) was located in all kidney compartments in response to diffuse interstitiallesions. The drop In signal intensity was due to capture of iron either by maerophages or mesangial cells gaining endocytic activity. It was correlated to the degree of proteinuria . Coneluslon: MA imaging. 24 h after inlection of USPIO. can evidence endocytic aetivity and can localize precisely this activity in the different kldney compartments. Purpose: The goal of this study was to evaluate changes of resistlve Index (AI) after extracorporeal shock wave lithotrlpsy (ESWL) in correlation with plasma big endothelin (ET-l) levels , perfUSion scintigraphy and magnetic resonance (MA) perfusion imaging. Methode: In 21 normotensive patients. divided in 3 age groups. the AI was measured belore 1. 3. 6 and 24 hours after ESWl. The AI was correlated with the findings on plasma Big ET-l . renal scintigraphy and MA perfUSion imaging. which were also performed belore and after ESWl. Results: The AI increased significantly in all patients from 0.64\u00b10.05 to 0.72\u00b10.06 after ESWL (p = 0.001). The untreated kidneys showed a less significant increase . The AI increased through 24 hours only in the patients eider than 60 yrs (age group 111). Elevated Big ET\u00b7l levels and signilicant changes on renal blood flow. determined by scintigraphy and MR perfusion imaging, were only lound in age group 111 after treatment. Concluslons: ESWL obviously causes considerable renal parenchymal damage, resulting in disturbances 01 renal perfusion particularly in the patients eider than 60 yrs. The RI correlated weil with the lindings on big ET\u00b7l, scintigraphy and MR perfusion imaging and therelore seems to be a valuable tool in assessing post ESWL changes. Purpose: FLASHSTAR is a eompletely noninvasive method lor measuring renal blood flow (RBF) . Using FLASHSTAR it is possible to determine RBF without an external contrast agent. Our purpose was to evaluate the utility 01 FLASHSTAR to assess ehanges in RBF alter ESWL. Methods: Using a whole body 1.5 Tesla MR scanner (Siemens, Erlangen. Ger\u00b7 many) FLASHSTAR was performed in 12 patients (3 lemale, 9 male, mean age 45;:7.9 years) belore and 12 hours after ESWL. The slice thiekness 01 the parasagittal planes was 6 mm with a held 01 view 01 220 mm and a matrix 01 128x128 pixels . Eaeh kidney was eovered by 9 slices. RBF mapswere ereated by subtraetion 01 two sets 01 data aequired alternately with and without 180\u00b7 inver\u00b7 sion applied to spins in the proximal arteries. Four regions 01 interest (ROI) were evaluated in eaeh kldney. Results: In the treated kidneys we lound a deerease in RBF ranging Irom 14.8 to 17.8 %, in the contralateral kidneys a decrease in RBF ranging Irom 10.7 to 12.7 \u00b0/~. Concluslons: We deteeted ehanges in RBF in both kidneys after ESWL which is in line with the laets known in literature.

The method is based on differences in the absorption 01 NIA light (700-900 nm) between normal and tumor tissue. However, intrinsic tumor contrast is low and hinders reliable detection especially 01 small cancerous lesions. NIA dyes with absorption in the near-inlrared region can principally be employed as contrast agents improving sensitivity and specilicity 01 the method. Methods and rneterlals: 10 hydrophilic cyanine dye derivatives were synthesized and characterized with respect to their photophysical and physicochemical prop\u00b7 erties. After injection into tumor-bearing nude mice, the fluorescence distribution was monitored by lIuorescence imaging. Aesulls: By structural modilications 01 indocyanine green a variety 01 novel cyanine dyes with different degrees 01 hydrophilicity and molecular weight were generated. The dyes exhibited high molar extinction and efficient fluorescence emission in the near-inlrared range.

Bare metal and overed stent designs were tested experimentally in flow models. regardlng mechanical properties. introduction and delivery technique. The bare stent was also implanted Into iliac arteries and carotid artenes of six dogs. Affer 3 weeks anglographic lollow-up slenls were explanted for mlCroscopic examination. Results: Bare stents with expanded diameters of 5 to 10 mm can be Introduced through a 4 Fr catheter with 0.038 inch luminal diameter. Covered stents with expanded diameter 01 up to 30 mm need a 10 Fr sheath. Initial technical success rate was :-90 %. Bare stents explanted affer 3 weeks were patent and revealed minor intimal hyperplasia in the areas of the stent strut connection points. Concluslon: This new stent deSign has a small introductoon diameter which is independent of the expanded diameter. The stent can be introduced through tortuous arteries and thus 15 a new option for treatment of intracramal artenes. The covered stent deSign also 15 sUlted for treatment of aneurysms.

Loealized loss of cell nuclei in the elastic layer beneath the stent was seen indicating cellular necrosis due to pressure against the aortic wall. In the clinical pilot study the primary success rate was 87 %. Four leaks were detected. We had 3 major and 3 minor complications. No death oecurred. Concluslon: Histopathological examinations in the ovine aorta showed no evidence of media disruption that could lead to progressive dilatation of the stented aortic necks. In the clinical pilot study the endovascular treatment of AAAs was an effective and safe approach of treatment. Nevertheless further studies are necessary to determine the biohistological response to stentgraft treatment. especially in diseased aortic tissue for further establishment 01 this promising interventional technique. Purpose: Poor visualisation of needles because of acoustic angle dependence is the major problem in ultrasound guided abdominal proeedures. We evaluated a new polymer coating (\"Echocoat. SPS Biopolymers) wh ich traps microbubbles increasing the scattering cross section. Methods and materials: We examined needles of varying lengths and diameters in artificial biopsy phantoms. ex-vivo tissue phantoms and with 3D in a water tank. (ATL. Bothell, Aeuson, Mountain View and Siemens. Issaquaw. 3D acquisitions were obtained at varying angles. in/out of plane. in fundamental. tissue harmonic and pulse inversion modes. Relative echogenicity. artefact and visual appearance of coated and uncoated needles was compared. Results: The shaft of the uncoated needles was only visible beyond a 70\u00b7 angle Irom the insonating beam and even with optimal in-plane orientation only the proximal needle was seen. With coated needles the entire barrel was seen with no variation in echogenicity .,' 10' Irom the beam . The coated needle absorbed acoustic energy eliminating reverberation artefact. Visualisation was slightly improved in pulse inversion. The pnncipal advantage was angle independence with the entire needle visualised in all conditions. modes and in different tissues. Concluslons: The polymer coating increased the seattering cross-section and was almost completely angle independent in/out of plane . No special electronics or harmonic mode is necessary. Objectlve: Intussuseeption is the most common abdominal emergency in earfy childhood . Standard methods for therapeutic management 01 intussuseeption Includes hydrostatic barium enema and pneumatic reduction. both performed under fluoroscopic control and involve iomzing radiation. Recently. ultrasoundguided reduction replaced the conventional approach in our hospital. Materiaf and methods: From September 1998 to September 1999 US-guided hydrostatic reduction was performed 10 37 consecutive cases. The enema consisted of mixture of the saline and water-soluble contrast medium (12:1 ratio) and esslons was glven at a hydroslahc pressure of 100-160 cm water. We used established sonographic cnteria of reduction: disappearance of the target. visualization of the fluid reflux. fluid fitting 01 the small bowel. Single abdominal radiography was done after reduction in doubtful ca ses. Results: In 33 cases (89 %) reduction was successful. No complications oecurred. For patients underwent surgery (1 resection and 3 manual reduction). Conclusion: Primary advantages of US-guided reduction are the lack of radiation exposure and improvement 01 the reduction rate. We recommend this method as optimal for the nonoperative management of childhood intussuseeption Angiography allows planning the surgical shunt or the liver transplantation. We present the MRA findings retating to Doppler and angiographic features. Materials and method: 9 patients (mean age 8) with portal hypertension after portal vein thrombosis, underwent USo duplex-color Doppler (7-4 Mhz) and MRA (1.5 T. body coil : contrast enhanced 3D,TOF and 3D-PC sequences) to plane surgery (5 patients) and to follow-up (3 renal shunts and 1 splenectomy). In 3 patients anesthesia was needed. In 4 cases we compared MRA with conventionat portography. Results: US is the main tool to detect splenomegaly. aseites. omental thickening. collateral vessels . Doppler demonstrates the portal and splenic blood flow speed and dlrection. MRA evaluates porto-slstemic shunts and the presence of flow: in non-collaboratlve children 3D-PC lechniQue IOcreased the quality reducing image artifacts. in collaboratlve patients contrasl enhanced 3D-TOF in breath-hold are time reducing. Doppler and MRA demonstrate an excellent correlation highlighting the diagnostic gain in non-invasive assessment. MRA was confirmed by conventional angiography in all but one case: in another MRA gave more informations. Concluslons: Doppler confirms its diagnostic value; MRA is an usefull tool in noninvasive assessment and follow-up.",

Reaufta: 8.3 % (girts) and 6.6 % (boys) were small per age. 8.3 % of the girls showed retarded BMC and BW (boys: 1.6 %/4.0 %). BMI was retarded in 16.7 % (girls) and 1.6 % (boys). Mean bone age was negative in both sexes (boys: -0.86 y; girls: -0.57 V). Children sullering Irom extrinsic asthma were significantly more involved in those retardations. All bone parameters showed significant correlations to body helght, none showed any dependence to ASG. Conelusions: Toplc steroid application and ASG do nol playa central role in retardation of bone parameters on atopic asthmatic children. An association 01 these symptoms to atopy was observed. PGE 2 and a changed aClivity 01 eSlrogens in atopics may playa greater role in pathophysiology of atopic asthma and bone.",

Methoda and materials: For staging reasons 112 patients with gastric carcinoma were preoperativety examined by Hydro-CT. In addition. 65 specimens 01 gastric carcinoma were submitted to MRI prior to histologie work-up. In case 01 early gastric carcinoma the imaging studies were retrospectively assessed lor the visibility. size. location, contrast enhancement and growth pattern 01 the tumors compared to the histologic lindings. Resulls: 901 18 (50 %) and 1001 13 (77 %) early gastric carcinomas were visible on the CTIMR-scans, retrospectively. Ulcerous tumors 01 1.5 cm in diameter or less may be missed by CT-and MR-imaging. Ulcerous lesions > 1.5 cm in diameter. flat and polypoid early gastric carcinomas 01 any size are reliably detected by CT and MRI. On CT-images. earty gastric carcinoma typically shows a marked contrast enhancement, however distinction lrom a T2-carcinoma is impossible. MRI shows a layered pattem 01 the gastric wall that allows to distinguish earty lrom advanced gastric carcinoma . Concluslon: Depending on the size and growth pattern earty gastric carcinoma may be missed by CT-and MR-imaging. MRI is superior to CT in staging early gastric carcinoma provided that in the near luture endoscopically applicable receiver coils will be suited to reliably show a layered pattern 01 the gastric wall . Purpoae: Exophytic adenocarcinoma 01 the stomach (EAS) is a tumor that has a large extraluminal portion. Exophytic growth 01 gastric carcinoma is very rare, and such tumor may be conlused with malignant stromal tumor (MST). The purpose 01 this study is to assess the US and CT lindings 01 EAS. and to determine their value in distinguishing between EAS and MST. Methods & materials: Fourteen pahents with EAS and 15 patients with MST were included in th,s study. US and spiral or dynamic CT lindings were assessed and compared retrospectively. Resulls: The location 01 tumor was gastric antrum in eight cases 01 14 EAS, but gastric body or lundus in all 01 15 MST (p = 0.0007). US and CT showed an exogastric mass with a variable degree 01 internal necrosis in all 01 EAS and MST. On CT images. thickening 01 the gastric wall adjacent to the mass appeared in ten 01 14 EAS (71.4 %). but it was not seen in all 01 15 MST (p = 0.000). Lymph node enlargement was seen in seven 0114 EAS and in three 0115 EAS (p '\u00b7 0.05). Discrepant US and CT lindings 01 necrosls appeared in EAS (p = 0.0077). but they were not seen in MST (p \" 0.05) Concluslon: Antrallocation. thickening 01 the gastric wall adlacent to an exogastric mass. and dlscordant images berween US and CT are typical 01 EAS. and allow distinction berween EAS and MST. 10 seconds (early) and 60-100 seconds (delayed) after injection 01 120 ml 01 contrast medium at an injection rate 01 6 ml/s through apreset 5 F catheter positioned in the celiac trunk . Spiral CT scans were assessed lor enhancing pattern 01 the normal gastric wall. tumor detectability, and accuracy 01 tumor staging . Resulls: Normal gastric mucosa was clearly visible as rwo or three layers in all patients on early phase scan and in eight patients on delayed phase scan. The primay tumors were correclly detected with CTGA in seven (88 %) 01 the eight early gastric cancers and in all 13 (100 %) advanced gastic cancers. The accuracy 01 CTGA lor T staging was 50 % and 77 % in earty and advanced gastrie cancer. respectively. The overall accuracy lor tumor detection and T staging was 95 and 67 %. respectively. The accuracy 01 CTGA lor the degree 01 serosal invasion and regional Iymph node metastasis was 77 0,;, and 70 %. respectively. Conctusion: CTGA technique improved tumor detection rate and accuracy 01 tumor stalng. especially in early gastric cancer, and could be very uselul in the preoperative staging 01 gastric cancer. Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy 01 Hydro-CT 01 the stomach in patients with gastric cancer lor preoperative staging and to attach its value in comparison to endoscopic ultra sound. Materials and methods: 45 patients with primary malignant gastric tumors were preoperatively evaluated with helical CT after oral applicalion 01 water and with endoscopic ultrasound. Each tumor was staged according to the TNM classilication and compared with postoperative pathological lindings. Resulls: The accuracy lor T staging with Hydro-CT was 81 %. lor N staging 69 % and lor M staging 97 %. The results for endoscopic ultrasound were 90 %_ 79 % and 47 %. The correct T classification was most difficult lor CT in differentiating T2 and T3. If NI and N2 were considered as a single group. N-stage accuracy increased lor Hydro-Cl, reaching 71 %. Most lalse postive slaging 01 Iymphnodes were caused by enlarged nodes due to inflammation. Three CT's were impossible to evaluate caused by insufficient extension 01 the stomach. Concluslon: Helical CT locused on the stomach is an alternative to endoscopic ultrasound and provides uselul ,nlormation to the surgeon .",

The second type of ulcer image was presented by hyperechoic oval focus against the widened hypoechoic wall . The third type was presented by oval hyperechoic focus against locally widened first hyperechoic wall layer. Echogenic foci in gastric ulcers were persistently visualized behind the crater. The focus may correspond to necroinflammatory materials found on the surface of ulcera ted lesions. Conclusion: It is concluded thus that the presence of this focus In the gastrointestinal wall can be sign of ulcerated benign or malignant lesions. Objective: To demonstrate the role of helical CT In the diagnosIs and staging of duodenal tumors. Materials and methods: From 1995 to 1999. 9 paltents wlth duodenaltumors were diagnosed In our hospital (4 adenocarcinomas. 1 lymphoma. 1 GI desmold tumor. 2 villous adenomas and 1 lelomyoma). Spiral CT was performed after administration ollarge amounts of oral contrast matenal. In 5 cases we used water. which allows better visualization of the duodenal wall . and does not intertere with postprocessing management of CT data. All cases were evaluated for the presence and extension of the tumor. ulceration , duodenal wall thlckentng. contrast enhancement and signs of the extraduodenal dlsease. Resuhs: Intraluminal masses wlth wall attachment were presented In 4 paltents (2 villous adenomas. 1 leiomyoma. and 1 adenocarcinoma) . A large mass with Intra and extraluminal components. causlng mechantcal obstruction was observed in a patient with lymphoma. Circumferential wall thlckening with lumen narrowing was diagnosed in 3 patients . all of them with adenocarclnoma . Obliteration of the adjacent fat was found in 3 cases, paraduodenallymphadenopathy was found in 2 cases and adrenal meta stasis was diagnosed in one patient. Concluslon: Helical Cl with adequate lumen distension is a highly accurate modality for detection, location. extension and characterization of duodenal tumors. Water is a preferable oral contrast agent. Purpose: To eompare IISsue harmonie Imaglng and eonventional sonography and delermine il lissue harmonie imaging Improves Image quality and helps In lesion eharaelerisation . Materials and methods: This study was earried out between June-September 1999.

AAA were judged to be infra renal ( . 1 cm Irom renal artery). Juxta renal (\" 1 cm from renal artery) or supra renal by two observers In consensus. The superior aneurysm neck and aneurysm diameter were measured electronically on both CT and MRA. Findings were compared with surgical findlngs (20 patients) Reeulls: No significant difference was noted in the mean aneurysm diameter (P .~ 0.01) between MRA (6.02 cm) and CT (6.10 cm) and the mean supenor neck length (P < 0.03) between CT (18.13cm) and MR (17.86cm). CT accurately predicted iliac involvement in 18 of the 20 patients while MRA accurately predicted iliac involvement in 19 of 20 patients. One AAA wh Ich was judged to be infra renal on CT and MRA. proved to be juxta renal at surgery and one AAA which was called juxta renal by imaglng was proven to be supra renal at surgery. Concluslon: MRA and hellcal CT are equally accurate In the pre-operative assess\u00b7 ment of AAA.",

TseholakoH: ViennalAT Introduction: The growing number of patients with d,sc disease and/or vertebrostenosis without immediate Indication to surgery causes an increasing need for prophylaxis and rehabilitation. especially methods for pain reductlon. In thls case minimal Invasive therapy. above all the penradlcular therapy (PRT) as weil as the epidural sacral infiltration (ESI) have been developed for an important complement of the conservative pain therapy. Aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of CT-guided therapy combined with concurrent physlotherapy and magnetic field therapy. Methods and materials: We carried out CT-gUided PRT and/or ESI on patients with radicular symptoms and CT-or MR-proven thoracalor lumbar disc herniation. and on patients with claudicatio spinalis wlth CT-or MR-proven lumbar vertebrostenosis. The patients referred from neurosurgery had either no primary need for surgery or had a history of multiple disk operations with chronic pain. The CT-guided interventions were pertormed in prone position using a 22 Gauge fine needle. During the PRT and ESI a solution of 2: 1 :0.5 parts of local anesthetic (Carbostesin 0.5 %). cortisol (Celestan blphase) and eontrast agent was applied respectively. The volume of the solution va ried from 3 to 7 ml. due to the individual anatomic situation. In ease of ESI at first a test Injection of 1 ml contrast agent was applied to confirm the exact epidural position of the needle tip. After 24 hours the elinieal outeome was controlled by paln reductlon (Visual Analog Seale) and the function status Ineludlng Oswestry-Low-Baek-Pain-Score accordlng to Fairbank et al. The evaluation of technical success oceurred by review of the CT examinations. Results: We pertormed 25 CT-guided interventions (11 ESI. 14 PRT) on 13 patients (9 women/4 men). 6 pallents showed a slgnihcant pain reduetion aeeording to the Visual Analog Scale and an improvement of daily life activities after the Oswestry-Seore. In 5 patients only small improvement was noted (1 of them needed surgery). in 2 patients an inerease in pain and adegradation of the Oswestry-Score was observed (1 of them needed surgery). On CT Ihe position of the needle tip and the spread of the medieal solution eould be localized preeisely. redueing the neeessary dose of loeal anesthetic and eortisol significantly. There were no eomplications in any ease. 228 esslons Concluslon: CT-guided minimal invasive therapy of disc disease and vertebrostenosis combined with concurrent physiotherapy and magnetic field therapy is an effective and standardized procedure to treat patients in an atraumatic way without any complications. Material & methode: 68 patients aHected by leH and/or right sided sciatalgia related to several abnormalities (Le. disc erniation, spondylosis, post-operative epidural scar), who previously underwent CT and/or MR study of the lumbar spine, underwent periganglionic injection of 2 cc (80 mgr) of Depomedrol\u00ae using a 20 G Chiba needle. with no administration 01 sedative, anesthetic or eontrast media agents.

The technique was based on a tumour leakage prolile during the lirst pass 01 contrast bolus. calculated Irom the time dependent plasma\u00b7contrast concentration lunction (PCCF) , in 3D TI weighted dynamic studies. We described the theoretical basis 01 the model and implemen\u00b7 talion 01 the teehnique. This new method has been applied to eleven patients with known intra-cranial neoplasms, including 7 gliomas. 4 meninglomas and 1 pituitary adenoma. Diagnoses were histologically conlirmed in 9 patients. The performance 01 the method has been evaluated by comparing results to those obtained Irom more conventional methods in patients with primary brain neoplasms. Tofts' multi\u00b7 compartment model was used to obtain endothehal permeability maps, surface area product (k) and leakage space vi (6) Irom T1W dynamic contrast enhancing 230 esslons image data sets. A standard \" variate model was used to calculate perfusion parametric maps lrom T2'W data. 80th maps generated Irom the new and conven\u00b7 tional methods were color rendered to improve the visibility 01 tumour regions with different permeabilities. Percentage 01 voxels, relected Irom perfusion and perme\u00b7 ability mapping, are compared lor all tumours. In addition. histograms endothelial permeability values measured Irom the entire tumour volumes were also com\u00b7 pared. Results show that the new permeabihty maps are visually compatible to those ca leu la ted using a conventional multi\u00b7compartment model. Quantitatively. new maps are Iree Irom over estimation due to lirst pass eHeets . The new blood volume maps, wh ich segment out the contamination 01 contrast leakage. agree closely with maps derived Irom suseeptibility studies. It is concluded that the new permeability maps are visually compatible with k maps derived Irom traditional multi\u00b7compartment models.

Wilkinson; SheffieldiGB PurpoM: The purpose 01 this study was to evaluate magnetic resonance proton spectroscopy in children with neurolibromatosis type 1. Specifically we have tested the hypothesis that speC1roseopy can distinguish between neurolibromatosis bright objects and brain glioma. Magnetic resonance imaging in neurofibromatosis type 1 has demonstrated abnormalities not previously recognised on either computed tomography or pathological studies. The abnormalities appear as regions 01 T2 prolongation in characteristic sites in the brain . These \"neurolibromatosis bright objects\" are thought to be a benign, sell-limiting phenomenon 01 no clinical relevance although malignant change has been described. Patients and methods: The diagnosis 01 neurolibromatosis type 1 was made by standard clinieal criteria in 15 children under the age 01 sixteen. Children were excluded Irom the study il Ihey had received prior chemotherapy or cranial irradiation. In addition to Ihe routine clinical Imaging proton spectroseopy was per10rmed using the STEAM lechnique (TA 25000 ms, TE 20 ms) Spectra were obtained Irom typical neurolibromatosis bright objects in the basal ganglia and any regions suggestive 01 atypleal bright obJects or tumor. ,,\"ulta: Fifteen children with neurolibromatosis type 1 were studied (male:lemale 9:6) with a median age 01 11.2 years. 14/15 children had typical neurolibromatosis bright objects and 5/15 had atypieal bright objects or brain glioma. Proton spectroscopy showed no major abnormalities in the three major peaks, however there were increased levels 01 lipid peaks in keeping with myelin breakdown. Atypical bright objects, thought to be gliomas, showed Ihe classle spectroscopic appearsnces 01 tumors ie reduced N-acetyl and increased choline peaks.

Concluslona: Gadobenate dimeglumine-enhaneed MAI is safe and beneficial for the detection 01 brain metastases. Overall, regimen 2 appears to provide belter results in terms ollesion detection, diagnostie eonlidenee and lesion eonspieuity. Methods and materials: The system is based on a workstation (IBM-compatible) running Windows 95/98 or NT operating system with a world-wide web server software and a DICOM agent software that receives images from DICOM compliant sources (CT, US, MAI. NM). Thls wOrkstation constilutes the DICOM gateway and the world-wide web server which can be remotely accessed with a clientserver world-wide web browser enhanced with a DICOM plug-in enabling the browser to access DICOM images. Results: Once medical images are sent to the server from any DICOM compliant sourees, they are stored in full 16 bit uncompressed DICOM format with no loss of information or windowing capabilities and can be easily viewed remotely by using low cost PCs and shareware software. The system serves multiple users simultaneously within and outside our department via world-wide web. Security is provided through user logins and passwords as weil as campus firewalls. Concluslon: The system provides easily and inexpensive distribution of medical images within and outside the radiology department thanks to the DICOM standardization and the world-wide web technology.

Purpose: The potential nephrotoxicity of iodinated contrast medium added to those of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and of chemotherapy has led us to investigate an alternative to assess brain lesions in HIV patients. Method8 and materlal8: We have examined 80 HIV patients (CD4 < 400/111) . Forty patients received the usual dose of gadiodamide and the other 40 patients received a tripie dose. We have evaluated the nephrotoxicity of gadodiamide in patients with either normal or altered renal function. its ability 10 highlight brain lesions and finally the optimal time delay to image the brain after intravenous injection. Resufts: We found no signlficant change in renal funchon whether single or tripie dose was used. The ablhty of gadodlamide to enhance visibility of brain lesions was not significantly increased when tripie dose was used. On the other hand. imaging the brain after a time delay of 10 minutes posHnjection increases the sensitivity ollesion detection. Conclu8lon8: The usual single dose of gadodiamide is sufficient to detect brain lesions in HIV patients. especially il imaging is performed 10 minutes postinjection. Tolerance of gadodiamide is excellent concerning renal funclion and represents an additional advantage of MRI compared to CT.",

The lallen lung sign consists in the lall 01 the collapsed lung away Irom the mediastinum occurring when the normal central bronchial anchoring anachment 01 the lung is disrupted. In contrast to the persistent pneumothorax. this slgn is specilic but rarely observed (2) . Our purpose is to present the corresponding computed tomography (CT) patterns . Methods and materials: These patterns were seen in two cases 01 right mainstem bronchial tears and diagnosed on contiguous 10 mm thick sequential CT slices. Results: The CT panerns consist in a caudal dependent displacement 01 the right upper lobe bronchus wich becomes obliquely oriented. Coneluslon: Tracheobronchial ruptures are now olten diagnosed by CT. since emergency rooms In primary centers are more and more Irequently equipped with CT devices. In presence 01 CT patterns suggesting a bronchial tear. immediate bronchoseopy should be required .",

Short-TE projection reconstruction (PR) MR microimages were acquired at 7.05 T on a Bruker NMA spectrometer equipped with a standard microimaging accessory. PA microimages (TA ~ 1500 ms, TE ~ 3.2 ms) were obtained with a very short echo time (3.2 ms) by using the partial echo acquisltion technique. The voxel resolullOn was 50x50xl50 mm and the image matrix was 128x128x32. Results: Short-TE projection reconstruction MRM allowed quantification and visualization of trabecular bone architecture. The use 01 a short echo time minimized the phase dispersion due to the high changes in susceptibility at the bone-marrow interface.

Methods and materials: 78 patients conceroed tor liver transplantation were prospectively investigated using a 1.5 T Magnetom (Siemens, 63 SP; Philips, ACS-NT). The sequence protocol included proton-density, T2-weighted SEfTSEsequences, TI-weighted SElGRE-sequences using unenhanced and iron oxideenhanced studies (Endorem: 1511mollkg bw). Within one month patients underwent liver transplantation . Specimen were histopathologically evaluated and findings correlated with MRI.Results: Histopathology revealed benign Ihemangioma (n = 2), regenerating nodules (n = 15)], and malignant liver lesions IHCC (n = 27)]. In 37 cases no focal lesions were detected. Cirrllotic liver parenchyma was delineated in 76 patients. A sensitivity ot 91.9 % and a specificity ot 86.7 % were calculated using iron oxideenhanced MRI compared with histopathologic findings. Three false negative case were reponed missing a trabecular HCC in cirrllosis. Six false positive diagnosis were assessed . Small HCC-nodules were diagnosed in ponal cirrllosis with fibrotic changes reterring regenerating nodules histopathologically. A statistically significant improved detection rate was documented using iron-oxide enhanced MRI compared to unenhanced MRI and previous CT examinations (p. 0.05) .
