The common nosocomial infections in PICU are bloodstream infections (20-30% of all infections), lower respiratory tract infections (20-35%), and urinary tract infections (15-20%); there may be some differences in their incidence in different PICUs. The risk of nosocomial infections depends on the host characteristics, the number of interventions, invasive procedures, asepsis of techniques, the duration of stay in the PICU and inappropriate use of antimicrobials. Most often the child had endogenous flora, which may be altered because of hospitalization, are responsible for the infections. The common pathogens involved are Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, E. coil Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella, enterococci, and candida. Nosocomial pneumonias predominantly occur in mechanically ventilated children. There is no consensus on the optimal approach for their diagnosis. Bloodstream infections are usually attributable to the use of central venous lines; use of TPN and use of femoral site for insertion increase the risk. Urinary tract infections occur mostly after catheterization and can lead to secondary bacteremia. The diagnostic criteria have been discussed in the review. With proper preventive strategies, the nosocomial infection rates can be reduced by up to 50%; handwashing, judicious use of interventions, and proper asepsis during procedures remain the most important practices.",

E-mail : skkabra@hotmail.com (35%), followed by bloodstream infections (21%) and UTI (16%). 4 These variations may arise from the differences in the proportion in the children ventilated in the PICUs. In adults, UTI is the commonest nosocomial infection followed by surgical infection and lower respiratory tract infections. 6 Staphylococcous aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebseilla, enterococci and Candida are the significant pathogens in pediatric services in the various sites examined. 3, 4 The risk of nosocomial infections in a PICU is the direct consequence of the severity of illness, 4 the level of invasive monitoring, the indiscriminate use of antimicrobials and the nature of diagnostic procedures. The NNIS data emphasizes that the duration of stay in an ICU is an important determinant of nosocomial infection; therefore, the length of stay should be one of the denominators in calculation of nosocomial infection rates2 In addition, it highlight the importance of invasive devices (endotracheal tubes, intravascular catheters, urinary catheters) in development of nosocomial infections. 3 In order to control for device usage and duration the infection rates can be represented as ratios per thousand device days. According to the latest report, ventilator associated pneurnonia (VAP) occurrence is 5.7 episodes per thousand ventilator days, UTI 5.2 per thousand catheter days, and bloodstream infection is 8 per thousand central line days. 3 In the same study, it was observed that 91% of all nosocomial bloodstream infections occurred in children with central venous lines, 95% of nosocomial pneumonias occurred in those on mechanical ventilation and 77% of UTIs in children with urinary catheters. 3 These figures highlight the important role of various devices in nosocomial infections.",

Nosocomial pneumonias are nearly four times more common in intubated patients than in non-intubated patients2 TM The risk may be greater with tracheostomy tubes. The filtration system of upper airways and mucociliary system of the large airways is bypassed during intubation, predisposing the patient to colonization with potential pathogens. Children with asymptomatic or symptomatic aspiration are at risk22 Children with tracheoesophageal fistula, pharyngeal aspiration, gastroesophageal reflux, pulmonary disease, malnutrition or immunodeflciency are at greater risk. The etiologic microorganisms for nosocomial pneumonia vary from hospital to hospital. The pediatrician must be familiar with the common microbes and the antimicrobial susceptibility of these microbes at his/her hospital. Gram-negative bacilli are the most important cause; 3,~5 staphylococci are the most important gram-positive organisms. Viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus are also important pathogens responsible for nosocomial pneumonia in PICUs. 3 However, some authors have suggested that viruses are less frequent as nosocomial pathogens in PICUs than in other areas of pediatric hospitals. 16 The optimal approach for diagnosing nosocomial pneumonia remains elusive. Clinical features, chest radiographs and culture of respiratory secretions have been used to establish the diagnosis. However, this approach is likely to overestimate the diagnosis. Fever and leukocytosis are also non-specific. Cough and sputum production are infrequently diagnostic of pneumonia in intubated children. Purulent tracheal secretions may be due to tracheitis, tracheobronchitis or pneumonia; differentiation can be difficult. Conditions such as atelectasis, pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may be confused with pneumonia2 6 Therefore, clinical suspicion has to be strong for diagnosing nosocomial pneumonia. A change in the child's status such as desaturation, increased requirement for supplemental oxygen, increase in ventilator settings or fever that are not explained by other events can be helpful in the diagnosis. In view of these problems and controversies Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have provided clinicians with guidelines for diagnosis of nosocomial LRTI. 1,2",

Lipid infusions have specifically been associated with risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections due to coagulase negative staphylococcus? 3 The risk of infection increases linearly with the duration of catheterization. The site of insertion is an important determinant of the risk of infection; rates for femoral catheters are higher than that for jugular or subclavian catheters. 3a Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC lines) may have lower infection rates. Inadvertent contamination during insertion may be an important risk factor for infection. This is highlighted by an inverse relation between the total number of catheters inserted by the physician inserting the catheter and the risk of significant catheter colonization. 3s Improper management of catheter after insertion significantly increases the risk of infection.

Contamination of the urinary tract by microbes occurs either through the catheter lumen or by ascending up along the catheter during or after insertion. 46 Extraluminal contamination is the commonest; it can occur by direct inoculation when the catheter is inserted or later, by the ascent of microbes from the perineum by capillary action in the thin mucus film contiguous to the external catheter surface. 47 Intraluminal contamination occurs by reflux of microorganisms gaining access to the catheter lumen because of failure of closed drainage or contamination of urine in the collection bag.

Well-directed infection control activities can reduce the nosocomial infection rates by up to 50%. u The importance of hand washing and hand disinfection is well understood. The appropriate hand washing technique includes wetting the hands, taking soap, rubbing hands to produce a lather, and performing wash movements that include rubbing palm to palm, right palm over left dorsum and vice versa, palm to palm with fingers interlaced, backs of fingers to opposing palm with fingers interlocked, rotational rubbing of right thumb clasped in left palm and vice versa, rotational rubbing with clasped fingers of fight hand in palm of left hand and with changed roles. 5s The whole procedure should not take less than 30 seconds. After washing, hands should be dried with disposable paper or cloth towel. It has been noticed that health personnel practice hand washing in only 25-50% of the opportunities? 6 In order to improve compliance, various hygienic hand rubs can be used. Rubbing of 3-5 ml of a fast acting antiseptic preparation on to both hands can be an effective substitute to hand washing. The various preparations available include n-propanol, isopropanol, ethanol, and chlorhexidine diacetate. 55 In addition to the specific measures mentioned earlier for prevention of specific nosocomial infections, proper sterilization/disinfection of various medical items is mandatory.
