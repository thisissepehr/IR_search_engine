This is a conservative estimate in view of the frequently inadequate blood volume drawn for blood cultures in paediatric patients (Connell et al., 2007) and the difficulty in recovering some organisms, which can be fastidious to culture (e.g. yeast). Most patients will be colonized by the infecting organisms, usually after initial admission to the hospital, before invasive disease becomes apparent (Walsh et al., 2005) . This is important because knowledge of local bacterial flora on a particular unit can inform empiric antibiotic choices. Organisms will then either invade an injured mucosal barrier secondary to chemotherapy (translocation from the oral mucosa or gut) or access the blood stream via the skin, through central venous catheters or skin breakdown. Gut translocation represents a major route of infection, and some authors have advocated the use of non-absorbable antibiotics in order to eradicate the carriage of potential pathogen in the gut (Paulus et al., 2005) . However, there is ongoing debate in the literature about the usefulness of this approach and its impact on the potential emergence of multiresistant organisms.",

In the last decade, the focus has shifted towards an increased prevalence of Gram positive organisms, which now represent about 70% of blood cultures of patients with FN (Hughes et al., 2002) . In order of frequency organisms recovered are: coagulase negative staphylococcus, viridans group streptococcus (VGS), Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Gram negative organisms are responsible for most of the mortality associated with sepsis in oncology patients. Most commonly isolated are Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter spp. Although usually described as a classical pathogen in the context of FN, Pseudomonas aeruginosa prevalence is highly variable from institution to institution. Anaerobic organisms are more commonly associated with intraabdominal sepsis and typhlitis (inflammation of the caecum seen post chemotherapy). Finally, infections with fungal pathogens, such as Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp., play an important role in high-risk patients (HSCT, AML) with persistent severe FN.",

The use of monotherapy versus combination therapy with an aminoglycoside has been much debated in the literature. A Cochrane Collaboration review, evaluating 46 randomized controlled trials, which included 7642 adult and paediatric patients, showed no significant benefit for combination therapy in terms of survival or treatment failure, while adverse events were more common with combination treatment (Paul et al., 2003) . The report recommends the adoption of monotherapy with a broad spectrum beta-lactam as the standard of care for the treatment of FN in adult patients. In another recent review summarizing studies and meta-analyses on the empirical antibiotic therapy in high risk patients, different authors draw a similar conclusion regarding the preference for monotherapy (Glasmacher et al., 2005) . The paediatric data is more limited at this time, but the gathering evidence seems to show similar efficacy using monotherapy as combination with an aminoglycoside (Agaoglu et al., 2001; Ariffin et al., 2006; Duzova et al., 2001; Hung et al., 2003) .",

Examples are piperacillin/ tazobactam and ticarcillin/clavulanate. These antibiotics are well suited in the context of FN as they possess a wide spectrum of activity on most Gram positive, negative, and anaerobic organisms. It is important to note that ticarcillin/clavulanate is less active in vitro than piperacillin/tazobactam against Streptococcus spp., E. faecalis, Klebsiella spp., and Pseudomonas spp. (Blondell-Hill, 2006) . Piperacillin/tazobactam display a good safety profile and has been shown to be an effective agent in children with FN (Corapcioglu et al., 2006; Fouyssac et al., 2005; Le Guyader et al., 2004) .",

The definition of fever used in these centres ranged from a persistent temperature of >37.58C to a single reading of >39.08C. Neutropenia was defined as either an ANC <1, <0.75, or <0.5 cells/mL depending on the unit. A variety of antibiotic combinations were used, the most common consisting of a piperacillin containing antibiotic together with an aminoglycoside compound. Indications for modification of the empiric regimen varied greatly and few centres had a defined endpoint for treatment with an antifungal. Finally, risk stratification was undertaken in 11 centres, with six using a policy of reduced intensity therapy in 'low-risk' patient.

The most common antibiotic regimens were a two-drug combination with an aminoglycoside and either an antipseudomonal penicillin or ceftazidime. Four centres had protocols for entirely outpatient management of patients meeting the local criteria of low risk. They used ceftriaxone AE tobramycin every 24 h. These centres report a high success rate with this approach with more than 80% of patients being successfully treated as outpatients. However, the lack of agreed consensus on the definition of low risk at presentation leads to most Canadian centres being still reluctant to use strict outpatient management.

This validated index is based on seven independent risk factors present at the onset of FN. These include age, clinical symptoms and severity (hypotension), type of cancer, previous fungal infection, and chronic pulmonary obstructive disease. No such consensus on risk prediction has been reached in children. However, several studies have attempted to develop a risk stratification based on history, physical findings, and laboratory values.

C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukins (IL-6, IL-8), and procalcitonin (PCT) have all been used either alone or in combination to try to predict the presence or absence of sepsis. In a study of 56 children with a known malignancy who presented with fever and neutropenia, Stryjewski et al. reported that combined CTpr (PCT precursor) >500 pg/ml at 24 h combined with IL-8 >20 pg/ml at 48 h after admission predicted sepsis with 94% sensitivity and 90% specificity (Stryjewski et al., 2005) . In a study involving 68 episodes of FN, investigators have reported on the superiority of IL-6 and PCT over CRP (Kitanovski et al., 2006) . PCT and IL-6 had both an excellent negative predicting value of 97.3% and 95.6%, respectively, on the day after presentation with FN. Different authors have used a combination of CRP, IL-8, and monocyte chemotactic protein 1-a (MCP-1-a) measured within 24 h of the onset of fever. MCP-1-a had the best specificity (92.3%) and positive predicative value (95%) (El-Maghraby et al., 2007) . It appears that the combination of two or three markers for sepsis holds some promise to help stratify risk in FN patients. However, prospective randomized studies are necessary. One unanswered question is how sensitive does a combination of tests needs to be if management is to be based on the result? In FN patients the stakes are high and both parents and doctors are likely to be reluctant to rely on laboratory results alone.",

They point out that the medical-exclusion criteria usually adopted for such treatment are stringent resulting in only between onequarter to a third of patients being eligible for outpatient management. Social barriers such as communication issues (language), distance from the hospital, or reluctance from parents or physicians to pursue the strategy can also prevent outpatient management. Nevertheless, this practice has been increasingly popular in the last decade and is the subject of several publications, which are detailed in Table 2 . Typical practice consists of a short course of observation (1-24 h) or hospitalization followed by outpatient management with either an intravenous agent such as ceftriaxone or oral ciprofloxacin, along with daily re-evaluation. Although a multicentre trial on risk stratification is necessary to further assess the safety and efficacy of outpatient management in children, it seems to be a reasonable approach at this time in a defined subset of patients at low risk for bacterial sepsis.",

In adult practice, the standard of care is now to perform a CT of the chest (+/-sinuses) at the time of starting antifungal therapy. This practice leads to an earlier diagnosis of IFI, in particular with moulds, such as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). In IPA, patients characteristically develop a 'halo-sign' (Fig. 1 ) on CT early in the first week of the disease (Caillot et al., 1997) . In a study of patients with IPA, 95% of subjects had characteristic halo-sign lesions on HRCT when chest X-ray showed either normal (29%) or non-specific findings (71%) (Hauggaard et al., 2002) . It is important to stress that the halo-sign is only present in the first week in IPA, and then progresses to be a non-specific infiltrate if the CT is performed at a later stage. Caillot and colleagues have also demonstrated the benefit of using early CT, along with early surgery and antifungals in IPA. Using this approach, they report a cure rate of about 84%, compared with a success rate of 40-50% usually reported in the literature (Caillot et al., 1997 (Caillot et al., , 2001 .",

In a retrospective review of CT in 109 episodes of prolonged FN in (Archibald et al., 2001) . In this review, 49% of children had CT abnormalities, which led to the modification of therapy in a third of patients. In a single institution review of 10 years of invasive aspergillosis in children, investigators from the UK document the finding on imaging in 27 patients with documented Aspergillus infection (Thomas et al., 2003) . The X-ray finding had great variability including segmental and multilobar consolidations, perihilar infiltrates, and nodular masses. CT examinations were available in eight cases, and had been performed late in the disease. None had halo-signs and two children had presence of cavitating nodules. The authors acknowledge that this is a reflection of the late stage of the disease in which the patients were scanned in an era where CT was not so readily available. At the conclusion of their article, they recommend performing CT early (at 5-7 days of fever) in order to find the characteristic halo-sign. We believe that the reluctance to CT high risk patients for IPA because of exposure to radiation must be balanced with the improved success rates in diagnosing and treating this illness in the early stages. Confirmation of the diagnosis by percutaneous biopsy has shown great specificity and susceptibility in paediatric patients (Hoffer et al., 2001) .",

Direct immunofluorescence techniques (DFA) performed on naso-pharyngeal washings Fig. 1 CT scan of the chest in a 12-year-old patient with AML and a history of long-standing neutropenia with 5 days of fever. The lesion in the right lung displays the characteristic 'halo-sign' feature of a macronodule surrounded by an area with a ground glass appearance. The patient was treated with intravenous followed by oral voriconazole with good clinical response (NPW) can identify most common respiratory viruses. This allows for a rapid and reliable diagnosis of viral URTI and has been a useful tool for paediatricians looking after immunocompetent children. Using this technique, reports have described that between 25% and 37% of patients with FN have viral respiratory infections (Arola et al., 1995; Tager et al., 2006) . However, studies looking at the role played by viruses in FN are limited and no large trial has been published to date. In addition, little is known about the interaction of viral pathogens with colonizing bacteria in the respiratory tract of FN patients. New molecular diagnostic techniques now available for testing of BAL or NPW might lead to further information on the prevalence and role of viruses in FN. The usual technique to collect NPW involves flushing a small volume of saline into a nostril with the head tipped back followed by the insertion of a soft narrow bore catheter into the nasopharynx and applying suction. There is reluctance to do this in oncology patients, not least because of the fear of inducing bleeding in thrombocytopenic children. Alternative techniques of nasal swabbing or of tipping nasally inserted saline back into a paper cup have been used in patients with some degree of success (Heikkinen et al., 2002) .",

In the last 15 years, VGS has become a leading cause of bacteriaemia and sepsis in the immunocompromised host, particularly in children undergoing chemotherapy for AML and post haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In two large multi-institutional studies of children with AML, VGS represented 22-25% of all bacteriaemic events (Gamis et al., 2000; Lehrnbecher et al., 2004) . In a review of 36 cases of VGS bacteriaemia from 1991 to 2000 at St. Jude Hospital, Memphis, TN, a recrudescence of cases linked to a change of protocol using increased doses of cytosine arabinoside was noted (Okamoto et al., 2003) . High-dose cytosine arabinoside has since been linked to the development of VGS sepsis by other authors (Lehrnbecher et al., 2004; Paganini et al., 2003) . It is unclear if this is secondary to a direct effect of this chemotherapeutic agent or is the indirect result of the development of mucositis and the prolonged period of neutropenia induced by this agent. Patients with VGS bacteriaemia often present with septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In the report by Okamoto et al., patients were febrile for a median of 15 days; 64% of patients were admitted to ICU, 33% experienced hypotension, and 28% had ARDS. A higher-thanexpected proportion of these patients (18%) subsequently developed an IFI (one of whom died of IPA) during the same febrile episode. No patients died primarily of VGS-associated septic shock. The prolonged duration of the fever and the associated symptoms are not clearly explained, as most of the blood cultures become rapidly negative. Some authors have suggested a role for an inflammatory response triggered by the organism leading to a degree of cytokine release dysregulation (Ihendyane et al., 2004) . However, no causative toxin has been demonstrated to be present in VSSS.",

This occurs either through plasmid transfer, such as in extended spectrum b-lactamase-producing organisms (ESBL) or though induction of a chromosomally encoded b-lactamase such as in class C cephalosporinase (AmpC). These two mechanisms constitute the most clinically relevant mechanisms of resistance in Gram negative bacilli. ESBL are mostly found in E. coli and K. pneumoniae. In a study looking at the prevalence of ESBL in K. pneumoniae bloodstream infection in a children's oncology unit in Malaysia, authors describe a prevalence of ESBL-producing bacteria in up to 50% of clinical isolates (Ariffin et al., 2000) . Predisposing factors were recent exposure to a third-generation cephalosporin-containing regimen and a hospital stay of 2 weeks or more. AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaciae, such as Serretia spp. or Acinetobacter spp., are inducible and can even develop resistance while the patient is on large-spectrum antibiotics. There is variability between antibiotics regarding their potential to induce this AmpC enzyme, as well as their lability to its production. First-generation cephalosporin ceftazidime and carbapenems are good inducers, but only carbapenems are not labile to the enzyme produced. The incidence of these various resistant organisms is variable from institution to institution and knowledge of local microbiological data is key in making decisions about appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy protocols.",

Outbreaks with VRE have been described in paediatric oncology units with associated deaths (Gray and George, 2000) . Patient-to-patient transmission on an oncology unit is an important recognized factor in the development of outbreaks. Therefore, barrier isolation associated with a restricted used of glycopeptides have been key in decreasing colonization of patients at risk (Nourse et al., 1998; Schuster et al., 1998) . The emergence of VRE also illustrates the difficulty of trading off the risk to the individual patient and society (or at least the oncology unit). A balance is required to give maximal benefit of broad-spectrum coverage to the individual and the wider benefit to the unit as a whole by limiting the use of unnecessary agents and therefore avoid the spread of organisms such as VRE.",

A standardized approach starts with a clear and accepted definition of fever and neutropenia. We define fever as an oral temperature of 38.38C, or 38.08C twice at least 1 h apart. Neutropenia is defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of less than 1000 cells/mL. Many patients are 'high risk' for the development of sepsis and invasive bacterial disease and are not eligible for outpatient therapy. Those are usually patients undergoing intense chemotherapy such as with AML on relapse protocols or post-HSCT. A recent episode of proven bacterial sepsis, expected neutropenia for more than 1 week, severe mucositis or the clinical suspicion of typhlitis also exclude patients for management as outpatients. Inclusion criteria for 'low risk' management usually include a clinically well child with viral symptoms, a CRP < 10 mg/L (other markers such as IL-8 or PCT can be used) and most importantly reliable parents with easy access to the hospital. The use of DFA on NPW samples can also help the clinician to determine if the episode has a viral aetiology. It is possible to manage low-risk patients with daily re-evaluation and intravenous ceftriaxone every 24 h (or oral ciprofloxacin) until blood cultures are negative at 48-72 h.",

The addition of an aminoglycoside to the empiric regimen is still commonplace in paediatric practice, but as discussed earlier, there is now little evidence to support its use. If an aminoglycoside is used, the choice of agent depends on the local microbiological data. In institutions where Enterococcus spp. is a predominant pathogen, gentamicin is considered a better agent owing to its synergistic properties when given along with b-lactams. If P. aeruginosa infections are predominant, the use of tobramycin may be a better choice. In patients presenting with septic shock, especially in patients with AML (at risk for VGS sepsis), or in patients with suspected MRSA sepsis (e.g. previously colonized or with tunnel infection), the empiric addition of vancomycin is recommended. The approach to management of suspected IFI is beyond the scope of this review. However, it is important to mention that patients with FN for 5 days or more should be assessed for the possibility of invasive fungal disease. Fungal blood culture should be drawn and a HRCT of the chest (+/-sinuses) should be performed in high risk patients (AML, ALL relapse, Post HSCT) prior to the start of antifungal therapy with either amphotericin B, a widespectrum triazole, or an echinocandin. Finally, it is important to remind the clinician of the necessity, upon identification of an aetiological pathogen, to review, and, if possible, narrow the spectrum of antibiotic therapy.",
