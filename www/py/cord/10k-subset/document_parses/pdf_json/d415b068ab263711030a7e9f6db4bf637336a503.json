Since aminopeptidase A (APA)-deficient mice develop hypertension APA appears to be an essential enzyme in the control of blood pressure via degradation of AngII. The robust hypertension seen in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) is due to activation of the RAS, and an accompanying decrease in kidney APA. Changes in APA have also been measured during the activation of the RAS in the Goldblatt hypertension model and Dahl salt-sensitive (DSS) rat. The DSS rat shows an elevation in renal APA activity at the onset of hypertension suggesting a protective role against elevations in circulating AngII, followed by decreased APA activity with advancing hypertension. Changes seen in human maternal serum APA activity during preeclampsia are similar to changes measured in renal APA in the DSS rat model. APA activity is higher than during normal pregnancy at the onset of preeclampsia, and with advancing preeclampsia (severe preeclampsia) declines below that seen during normal pregnancy. Serum APA activity is also increased during hormone replacement therapy (HRT), perhaps in reaction to elevated levels of AngII.

A second subtype, the AT 2 receptor (AT 2 R) is also involved in the mediation of blood pressure, renal function, and vascular growth [3, 8, 9] . AngII has been considered the end product of the peripheral RAS and acts as an agonist at these two receptor subtypes. Angiotensinogen serves as a precursor protein to all angiotensin peptides (Fig. 1) . The decapeptide, angiotensin I (AngI), is formed by the protease renin (EC3.4.23.15) acting upon the N-terminal of angiotensinogen. In turn AngI is a substrate for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE: EC3.4.15.1), a zinc metalloprotease that hydrolizes the carboxyl terminal dipeptide histadine-leucine (His-Leu) to form AngII [10] . AngII is converted to AngIII by APA that cleaves the aspartic acid (Asp) residue at the N-terminal [11] [12] [13] [14] . Fig. 1 The renin-angiotensin cascade. Angiotensinogen is cleaved by renin to form angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is converted to AngII by angiotensin-converting enzyme.

The APA inhibitor 3-amino-4thio-butyl-sulfonat (EC33) has been shown to increase the half-life of AngII by 2.6-fold as measured in hypothalamic homogenates, and completely blocks the formation of AngIII. An APN inhibitor 2-amino-pentane-1,5-dithiol (EC27) increased the half-life of AngIII by 2.3-fold. When AngII was icv injected in mice plasma vasopressin levels were increased 2-fold. The co-application of EC33 with AngII inhibited this AngII-induced vasopressin response in a dose-dependent fashion. In contrast, icv injection of EC27 increased plasma vasopressin levels in a dosedependent fashion. This increase in vasopressin release following the application of EC27 could be blocked by the accompanying injection of the nonspecific angiotensin receptor antagonist saralasin (Sar 1 , Ale 8 -AngII). These results suggest that central angiotensin-induced vasopressin release is dependent upon the conversion of AngII to An-gIII, and therefore AngIII may be the main effective peptide in the brain with respect to the mediation of vasopressin release. Consistent with these findings, Song and colleagues [29] developed an antiserum with anticatalytic activity against APA. When icv infused it reduced both drinking and blood pressure responses to the subsequent icv delivery of AngII by 73 and 59%, respectively. This same antiserum had no effect on icv-infused AngIIIinduced drinking and blood pressure responses. Our laboratory has utilized icv-infused EC33 and PC18 (an APN inhibitor with similar structure to EC27) followed by the metabolically stable analogs [D-Asp 1 ]AngII or [D-Arg 1 ] AngIII to determine the relative contributions by AngII and AngIII to pressor responses in rats [30] .

In contrast, pretreatment infusion with PC18 extended the duration of the [D-Asp 1 ]AngII pressor effect by approximately 2-3 times and the duration of the [D-Arg 1 ]AngIII effect by approximately 10-15 times. Pretreatment with the specific AT 1 R antagonist losartan blocked the pressor responses induced by the infusion of both analogs indicating they act via the AT 1 R subtype. These results suggest that the brain AT 1 R might be designed to preferentially bind AngIII, or an AngIII-like compound, in mediating blood pressure maintenance.

Several mechanisms have been suggested to underlie this response by DSS rats including sympathetic arousal, deficiency in nitric oxide, increased plasma endothelin-1, an overactive RAS [59] .

Severe tubulointerstitial damage with tubular dilation and arteriosclerosis with thrombi were also observed at week 18. There are a number of reports indicating increased glomerulosclerosis with advancing hypertension in DSS rats. The inhibition of RAS activity by ACE inhibitors or ARBs is known to reduce glomerular injury irrespective of the antihypertensive effects in DSS rats, suggesting that local AngII plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis [60] . The AngII produces glomerulosclerosis through various mechanisms including enhanced cellular proliferation and over expression of chemotactic factors and cell adhesion molecules. The low-salt DSS rat showed no histopathological renal injury. Our laboratory has found the immunostaining of glomerular APA in high-salt DSS rats to be enhanced at week 10, accompanied by mild damage due to fibrosis and hypercellularity. With advancing weeks APA staining decreased in the severely injured glomeruli and finally disappeared. Thus, sclerotic glomeruli progressively lose the ability to express APA. We also noted hyalinization of glomeruli in DSS rats over time that could have contributed to this failure to produce APA. The degree of APA immunostaining in the glomeruli, or elsewhere in low-salt DSS rats, did not change over weeks. As previously mentioned Kobori and colleagues [58] showed that high-salt diet increased intrarenal angiotensinogen levels in DSS rats. Taken together these reports suggest that over time this model suffers increased glomerular damage primarily due to progressive elevations in AngII levels that occur as the capacity to synthesize APA diminishes.
