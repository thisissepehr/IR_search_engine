Thus, we do not understand how viral LRTI either predispose or serve as a marker of children to develop asthma. The Tennessee Children's Respiratory Initiative has been established as a longitudinal prospective investigation of infants and their biological mothers. The primary goals are to investigate both the acute and the long-term health consequences of varying severity and aetiology of clinically significant viral respiratory tract infections on early childhood outcomes. Methods: Over four respiratory viral seasons, 2004-2008, term, non-low birth weight previously healthy infants and their biological mothers were enrolled during an infant's acute viral respiratory illness. Longitudinal follow up to age 6 years is ongoing.",

The prospective cohort has the longitudinal design properties that may overcome potential limitations intrinsic to retrospective studies, such as our TABS cohort.

LRTI and URI were defined using both the physician discharge diagnosis, as well as post-discharge chart review, and those cases that were not clearly identified as either LRTI or URI were reviewed by a panel of paediatricians who determined whether the illness represented an LRTI, URI, croup or other, which included those that could not be categorized with the available clinical information. Acute respiratory illness severity was determined using the ordinal bronchiolitis score that incorporates admission information on respiratory rate, flaring or retractions, room air oxygen saturation and wheezing, into a score ranging from 0 to 12 (12 being most severe). 27, 28 highly sensitive and specific qRT-PCR assays for many common respiratory viruses, including hMPV, HCoV, RSV, influenza A and B, parainfluenzaviruses 1-3 and rhinovirus. Real-time RT-PCR is performed using the Cepheid Smart Cycler II. All specimens are first tested for GAPDH to confirm integrity of RNA and monitor for potential PCR inhibitors. Negative and positive controls are included with each run, including RNA runoff transcripts to generate a quantitation curve. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] If rapid antigen and/or culture for RSV or Influenza were performed at the discretion of the admitting physicians during the index visit, these results are also captured and entered in the database. The cells are collected using Mid Turbinate Peds Nylon Flocked Swabs (MicroRheologics, Brescia, Italy), and placed into collection and digestion media, followed by processing and plating onto collagen IV coated tissue culture and grown at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator. To develop techniques for isolation, short-term culture, and in vivo modelling of epithelial and stromal cells, a xenograph model has been developed. Following short-term growth in culture, cells are transferred to denuded rat tracheas and implanted subcutaneously in nude mice.",

Thus while viral respiratory infections may alter lung physiology and target the inflammatory response to the lower airway, this may only occur during a vulnerable time period during development of the immune system or lung, or in the presence of other risk factors. This developmental component may further reflect important gene-environment interactions that regulate both short-and long-term airway physiological alterations that manifest themselves clinically as childhood asthma. Efforts to determine and define the role of these factors, including disease severity, maternal atopy and other environmental exposures, such as second-hand smoke, to asthma pathogenesis are the focus and goal of the TCRI.",

First, the study sample was not randomly selected from the general population, but instead was recruited from a single hospital and clinic-based setting, the Vanderbilt Children's Hospital. While Vanderbilt hospitalizations represent greater than 90% of Davidson County/Nashville infant hospitalizations, it represents a smaller proportion of emergency department visits (51%), and likely even fewer paediatric acute care visits. 2 The relatively low participation rate among eligible subjects is multifactorial and the result of the long-term nature of the study, the lack of study personnel to enrol all eligible subjects, as well as lower willingness among outpatients to extend their visit in order to participate in the study. While this impacts the demographics and exposures of the study population, and thus generalizibility of our study results, it should not impact the findings of the role of infant viral infection on the outcomes of interest. Next, while airway hyperreactivity is not assessed in making the diagnosis of childhood asthma, the identification of incident asthma cases will take into consideration the positive response to a validated written questionnaire that has been compared with bronchial provocation testing. 6, 8 While such an ascertainment strategy might result in the underdiagnosis of asthma, it is unlikely to result in false positive diagnoses during the sixth year of life. Finally, as with many studies, where all eligible participants were approached for participation, difficulty was encountered in follow up of those currently age-eligible for follow up. Strategies to address this include study personnel doing a significant number of follow-up visits at the subject's home, and shipping follow-up materials and requests to paediatricians of subjects who have moved from the region.",
