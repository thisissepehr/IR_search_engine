Objectives This study aimed to summarize the incidence of IPF infection secondary to influenza virus infection and further explore its etiologic mechanism and high-risk factors. Methods All adult patients with confirmed influenza A (H1N1) virus infection admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) of Nanjing Drum Hospital from November 2017 to March 2018 were retrospectively selected. The differences in baseline factors, risk factors, immune function and outcome parameters were studied between patients with and without IPF. Results Of the 19 critically ill patients with H1N1 infection, 11 (57.9%) developed IPF infection after 7 days of ICU admission. Two patients had proven and nine probable IPF infection. A difference in human leukocyte antigen-DR isotype (4HLA-DR; day 7-day 1) was found between the two groups. 4HLA-DR (day 7-day 1) was higher in patients with no IPF infection than in those with IPF infection [(14.52 \u00b1 14.21)% vs ( -11.74 \u00b1 20.22)%, P = 0.019]. The decline in HLA-DR indicated impaired immune function secondary to fungal infection in patients with H1N1 infection. Conclusions IPF infection was diagnosed in 57.9% of critically ill patients with H1N1 virus infection after a median of 7 days following ICU admission. A continuous decline in immune function could lead to the development of IPF infections. Dynamic monitoring of immune function may help in the early detection of IPF infection.

[15] retrospectively selected all adult patients with confirmed H1N1 virus infection admitted to the ICU of the two tertiary care hospitals from September 2009 to March 2011. These 40 patients had an average APACHE II score of 23 \u00b1 8, an average SOFA score of 11 and a high degree of disease risk. Of 40 critically ill patients with confirmed H1N1, 9 (23%) developed IPA after 3 days of ICU admission. In contrast, the present study focused on recruiting to be less than that reported by Wauter. However, further observations revealed that the patients in the present study had a relatively short period of time from onset to ICU admission, and the statistics included APACHE II scores and SOFA scores within 24 h of ICU admission. After ICU admission, the disease was still in a developing stage and did not reach the critical peak in 24 h. The lowest oxygenation index was 93.34 \u00b1 30.57 mm Hg in the course of the disease. Also, 88% of patients opted for mechanical ventilation and 28% for ECMO. In the study by Wauter, 23.5% of patients opted for ECMO and 88.2% for mechanical ventilation. Hence, the patients in the two studies were quite similar in terms of criticality and disease characteristics. In the aforementioned study, the incidence of invasive fungal infection in the lungs was 9/40 (23%). In the present study, the incidence was 11/19 (58.9%). One possible hypothesis was the evolution of more virulent influenza strains, as exemplified by the pandemic H1N1 strain, causing more severe pneumonia. Compared with previous findings [17] , the average viral transposition time of the patients was longer [(10.88 \u00b1 7.81) days] and the duration of the disease increased in the present study. This result also proved the previous hypothesis. A retrospective study found that the risk of IPF infection was higher when respiratory viruses were in circulation, in particular, influenza A [20] . IPF infections were prone to occur during viral infection and replication process. The time between diagnosis of influenza and IPF infection in 11 patients was a mean of 7.3 days (SD \u00b1 0.7). This result was almost consistent with previous findings [21] . The data in the present study suggested that the use of corticosteroids 7 days before ICU admission was an independent risk factor for fungal super-infection. In this study, no-IPF group had prehospitalization rates of 28.6% and 20%. No significant difference was observed between the two groups, demonstrating no significant relationship between glucocorticoid use and secondary fungal infection before hospital admission. This result was not consistent with previous observations. Therefore, other mechanisms leading to decreased immune function might exist. Influenza virus affects the production of cytokines, in turn impacting the immune system. H1N1 virus leads to an increased and prolonged production of interleukin-10 (IL-10) in plasma. This, in turn, affects Th2 response and adaptive immunity mediated by Th2, which is associated with an increased risk of IPF infection [22] . The influenza virus has been reported to impair phagocytosis and alveolar macrophage function, increasing the risk of IPF infection [9] . The severe systemic inflammatory syndrome, which is called compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome or immunoparalysis, may occur in patients with severe influenza infection, making them vulnerable to severe super-infections by bacteria and fungi [10] . The immune function indicators of patients were evaluated within 7 days after admission, and the dynamic changes in immune function were observed. In previous studies, a decrease in the peripheral blood lymphocyte count was one of the risk factors for secondary fungal infections [23] . However, this phenomenon was not observed in the present study. Interestingly, the HLA-DR percentage on days 1 and 7 did not differ significantly between the groups. Therefore, the difference in HLA-DR percentage on days 1 and 7 was compared between the two groups in the present study. 4HLA-DR (day 7-day 1) was higher in patients with no IPF infection than in those with IPF infection. The decline in HLA-DR indicated impaired immune function secondary to fungal infection in patients with influenza A/H1N1 infection. With constant exposure to fungi, the normal human immune system developed defenses for fungal clearance via alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, monocytes and NK cells [24] . This study showed that a continuous decline in immune function could lead to the development of IPF infections. In previous studies, most patients with aspergillosis associated with influenza did not have classic risk factors or radiographic findings [25] . Therefore, dynamic monitoring of immune function may help in the early detection of IPF infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 15, "end": 19, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1560, "end": 1564, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1909, "end": 1913, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2164, "end": 2168, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3052, "end": 3056, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 3191, "end": 3194, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 3452, "end": 3456, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 3739, "end": 3743, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 4432, "end": 4436, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 4690, "end": 4694, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In summary, IPF infection is a potential complication of severe influenza infection.
