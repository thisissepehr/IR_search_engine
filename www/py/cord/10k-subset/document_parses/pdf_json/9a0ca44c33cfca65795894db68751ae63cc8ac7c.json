Using mouse macrophages, Guo et al 6 found that bile acids inhibited Nlrp3 inflammasome activation, whereas another report indicated that bile acids activated Nlrp3 inflammasome in mouse macrophages. 7 However, it must be stressed that the cells in all of these studies were treated with bile acids that either were not the major endogenous bile acid in mouse or used concentrations that were not physiologically or pathophysiologically relevant. Nevertheless, the Nlrp3 inflammasome could be activated in liver tissue in a mouse model of lithocholic acid induced cholestasis, 8 while elevated messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of IL1R1, NLRP3, and caspase-1 was also observed in the liver of patients with biliary atresia. 9 Loss of Il-1r1 or Nlrp3, but not of the Caspase-1 gene, reduced bile duct injury in a mouse model of biliary atresia induced by rotavirus infection. 9 However, none of these studies addressed the role of bile acids in inflammasome activation under cholestatic conditions. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether bile acids directly activate the inflammasome or whether the inflammasome is associated with other forms of cholestatic liver diseases, such as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).",

Our results support a role for the inflammasome in cholestatic liver injury (most likely from macrophages but not from hepatocytes) but suggest that endogenous bile acids do not directly activate the inflammasome. Inflammasome deficiency (Casp1 -/mice) reduced hepatocyte injury after BDL by promoting anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages in the liver, where liver fibrosis was increased.",

Western blot analysis further confirmed that the protein expression of NLRP3 and caspase-1 was increased in these cholestatic liver tissues when compared with the healthy control subjects ( Figure 1B) . Previous reports have shown that serum IL-1b levels are increased in patients with PBC and PSC. 10, 11 Together, these findings suggest that the inflammasome plays a role in the pathogenesis of human cholestatic liver injury.",

However, cleaved caspase-1 (20 kD) was found only in WT BDL livers ( Figure 2B ), indicating that the inflammasome was activated only in the WT cholestatic mice. Deficiency of Caspase-1 protein (both pro and cleaved forms) in Casp1 -/livers confirmed that the inflammasome was not activated in these mice. After BDL for 7 days, plasma levels of liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were significantly lower in the Casp1 -/mice than in the WT BDL group ( Figure 3A ). Plasma IL-1b was elevated in WT mice but not in Casp1 -/mice after BDL. In contrast, bile acid levels in both plasma ( Figure 3A ) and liver, while elevated after BDL compared with the sham control subjects, were not different between the Casp1 -/and WT mice 7 days after BDL (data not shown).",

While there were no differences in Elane and Cd3e expression between WT and Casp1 -/groups after 7 days BDL, Casp1 -/-BDL livers had significantly higher amounts of F4/80 than was detected in the WT BDL livers ( Figure 5A ), indicating that there were more macrophage/Kupffer cells in the absence of inflammasome activation. To confirm this observation, we performed immunohistochemistry of liver sections from WT and Casp1 -/-BDL livers. As shown in Figure 5B , there were more F4/80 positive areas in Casp1 -/livers than WT livers after BDL. To further characterize the hepatic macrophage or Kupffer cell phenotype in these mice, we analyzed the mRNA expression of markers that differentiate between pro-and anti-inflammatory types (ie, M1 and M2, respectively), including Arginase 1, Il-4, Il-33, Cd163, Fizz1, and Ym-1. We found that BDL resulted in a significant decrease in expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine Il-4. However, this decrease was significantly less in Casp1 -/-BDL liver than in WT BDL livers ( Figure 5A ), suggesting there were more antiinflammatory M2-type macrophages in the Casp1 -/-BDL livers. Higher expression levels of other M2-type macrophage markers (ie, Cd163, Il-33, and Fizz1) were also found in Casp1 -/-BDL livers than in WT BDL livers, consistent with a higher number of M2 macrophages in the former ( Figure 5A ). There were no differences in arginase-1 mRNA expression among the 4 groups, presumably because arginase-1 is normally abundantly expressed in hepatocytes. Immunofluorescent labeling of hepatic CD206 (another M2 macrophage marker) further confirmed that there were more M2 macrophages in Casp1 -/-BDL livers than in WT BDL livers ( Figure 5B ). Together, these findings suggest that the normal function of inflammasome activation is proinflammatory (as seen in WT BDL mice) but that in the absence of inflammasome activation, there is a partial conversion from a proinflammatory to an anti-inflammatory environment with respect to the macrophage phenotype (as seen in the Casp1 -/-BDL livers).",

When hepatocytes were treated with 100 mM taurocholic acid (TCA) (the major endogenous bile acid in mice) for 24 hours, mRNA expression of chemokines Ccl2, Cxcl2, and Cxcl10 was markedly increased, as previously reported ( Figure 6A ), 1,2 but Il-1b mRNA expression remained undetectable in these cells. Deficiency of caspase-1 did not alter TCA induction of Ccl2, Cxcl2, Cxcl10, and Nlrp3 in these mouse hepatocytes ( Figure 6A ). In addition, Western blot analysis did not detect any cleavage of caspase-1 when WT mouse hepatocytes were exposed to TCA (up to 300 mM, the high end of pathophysiologically relevant concentrations) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for 16 hours ( Figure 6B ), indicating that the inflammasome was not activated in hepatocytes by these measures. Furthermore, glycocholic acid 50 mM, another major endogenous bile acid-and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (100 mM) treatments also did not cause pro-caspase-1 cleavage in these mouse hepatocytes. In contrast, increased pro-Il-1b protein expression and pro-caspase-1 cleavage were found in mouse macrophage cultures that were exposed to LPS and ATP, an indication of inflammasome activation in these cells (as a positive control). However, TCA treatment alone or in combination with LPS and ATP increased neither pro-Il-1b protein expression nor caspase-1 cleavage ( Figure 6C ).",

We found that (1) hepatic expression of the inflammasome genes NLRP1, NLPR3, caspase-1, and IL-1b (mRNA and or protein) were increased in cholestatic patients with PBC or PSC ( Figure 1 ); (2) increased expression and activation of inflammasome genes were also seen in cholestatic mouse livers after BDL ( Figure 2) ; (3) lack of inflammasome activation in mice reduced markers of cholestatic hepatic injury (ALT and ALP) but increased liver fibrosis after BDL (Figures 3 and 4) ; (4) deficiency of caspase-1 in mice also promoted an increase of the M2 macrophages phenotype in the liver after BDL, thus presumably partially converting a proinflammatory phenotype to an anti-inflammatory state ( Figure 5 ); and (5) at pathophysiological concentrations, the major endogenous bile acid TCA did not activate the inflammasome in mouse hepatocytes or macrophages ( Figure 6 ). Therefore, we conclude that while the inflammasome is activated in cholestatic liver and contributes to the injury, this activation does not appear to occur through the direct action of bile acids. It is likely that this activation involves the macrophage rather than the hepatocyte in the liver.",

            "text": "The role of the inflammasome in the pathogenesis of different diseases has often been conflicting. Inflammasome signaling has been reported to protect the liver from hepatic tumor growth, virus infection and to increase survival rates in response to a hepatic parasitic load (Trypanosoma cruzi) in mice. 5, [12] [13] [14] In contrast, the inflammasome contributes to the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease and NASH. 4, 15 In the present study, we found that the inflammasome is indeed activated in cholestatic livers and that loss of inflammasome activation in mice reduces acute manifestations of hepatic injury (ALT and ALP) without significant alterations in liver necrosis, bile duct proliferation, or gross estimates of inflammation, while paradoxically enhancing . Data presented as mean \u00b1 SD. No differences were seen for Ccl2 and Cxcl2 expression between the 2 groups. liver fibrosis. If fibrogenesis is considered as part of the process of tissue healing following an inflammatory injury, we may conclude that deactivation of the inflammasome in cholestasis blocks its proinflammatory properties, suggesting that when active, its role would be more consistent with that seen in other liver disorders such as alcoholic liver disease and NASH. 4 This hypothesis is consistent with the increase of the M2-type macrophages in the liver of the Casp1 -/-BDL mice, as reflected by the higher expression of its marker genes such as Il-4, Il-33, Cd163, Fizz1, and CD206 ( Figure 5 ). The increase in Il-4 is known to lead to stimulation of Tgf-b1 expression, a classic profibrotic cytokine. [16] [17] [18] This would explain why fibrosis was increased in Casp1 -/-BDL livers, as illustrated in Figure 7 . The reduced hepatic injury seen in Casp1 -/-BDL mice (absence of the inflammasome) is also consistent with several earlier reports in which depletion of macrophages attenuated liver injury in rodent models of cholestasis. [19] [20] [21] [22] Recent studies indicate that elevated hepatic levels of bile acids can initiate an inflammatory response by stimulating cytokine expression in hepatocytes. 1,2 Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that bile acids might activate the inflammasome in the cholestatic liver. However, our findings do not support this hypothesis and indicate that bile acids do not directly activate the inflammasome in hepatocytes or macrophages or Kupffer cells at concentrations that are pathophysiologically relevant. Previous studies that have supported this hypothesis have used hydrophobic bile acid species such as chenodeoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid at high concentrations that are not seen in cholestatic patients or animal models and thus are likely to be artifacts of these in vitro conditions. 7, 8, 23 The major species of endogenous bile acids are conjugated bile acids that require bile acid transport proteins to enter cells. These transporters are only seen in hepatic parenchymal cells and are absent in macrophages and other hepatic cells. Unconjugated bile acids can diffuse into cells but never reach pathophysiologic levels. 24 While the mechanism by which the inflammasome is activated in cholestatic liver remains to be determined, we speculate that it is related to the welldescribed inflammatory response generated from the hepatocyte that is induced by the hepatic retention of bile acids. 1,2,25 When hepatic parenchymal cells undergo necrosis during cholestasis, alarmins (eg, ATP and other damageassociated molecular patterns) are released from the dying cells and would trigger the activation of the inflammasome in hepatic macrophages or Kupffer cells and orchestrate an immune response that contributes to liver injury, 22 as shown in Figure 7 .",

Liver sections were also stained with Sirius Red for fibrosis evaluation. Liver histology was blindly assessed for, necrosis, bile duct proliferation, fibrosis and inflammation on a 1 to 4\u00fe scale. Immunohistochemistry staining and immunofluorescent labeling of liver sections were performed as previously described. 30 Specifically, for immunohistochemistry staining of F4/80, a monoclonal antibody against mouse F4/80 (Cat# 70076, from Cell Signaling Technology [Danvers, MA], 1:200 dilution) was used to probe deparaffined sections from 4 randomly selected animals in each BDL group. Six images were randomly taken across the section under 100\u00c2 magnification using an Olympus (Olympus Corp, Japan) BX51 microscope. ImageJ 1.51n software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) was used to calculate the positive-signal area. For immunofluorescent labeling of CD206, a monoclonal antibody (Cat# MCA2235T, from Bio-Rad [Hercules, CA], 1:100 dilution) was incubated with frozen liver section from 3 randomly selected animals in each BDL groups. Five images were randomly taken across the section under 200\u00c2 magnification using an Zeiss (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC, White Plains, NY) Fluorescent microscope. The count of CD206 positive cells in each image field was assessed in a blinded fashion. Liver hydroxyproline content was assayed as previously described. 30 ",
