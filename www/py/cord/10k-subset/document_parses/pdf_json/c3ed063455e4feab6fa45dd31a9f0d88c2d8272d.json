Unfortunately , the heterogeneity of sepsis at the individual patient level has hindered advances in the field beyond the current therapeutic standards, which consist of supportive care and antibiotics. This complexity has prompted attempts to develop a precision medicine approach, with research aimed towards stratifying patients into more homogeneous cohorts with shared biological features, potentially facilitating the identification of new therapies. Several investigators have successfully utilized leukocyte-derived mRNA and discovery-based approaches to subgroup patients on the basis of biological similarities defined by transcriptomic signatures. A critical next step is to develop a consensus sepsis subclassification system, which includes transcriptomic signatures as well as other biological and clinical data. This goal will require collaboration among various investigative groups, and validation in both existing data sets and prospective studies. Such studies are required to bring precision medicine to the bedside of critically ill patients with sepsis. 1 One of the key tenets of precision medicine is the concept of enrichment 5, 10 . Generally, enrichment refers to the selection of a subgroup of patients who are more likely to respond to a given therapy, when compared with an unselected population 11 . Enrichment strategies can be further categorized as prognostic or predictive. Prognostic enrichment refers to the selection of patients with a higher likelihood of having a disease-related outcome of interest, such as mortality 5, 10, 11 . Employment of this strategy is particularly important when considering the risk-to-benefit ratio of a potential therapy, as therapies carrying more than minimal risk might only be justified in patients with a higher likelihood of a diseaserelated event 5 . Additionally, the use of prognostic enrichment strategies is an important tool in study design, as preferentially selecting patients with higher event rates can both improve the power of the study and reduce the number of patients needed for enrolment 11 . A pertinent example of this concept is the CONSENSUS trial, which demonstrated in a relatively small sample size (n = 253) that the ACE inhibitor enalapril significantly reduced mortality in patients with severe congestive heart failure, whereas subsequent similar studies that included patients with varying illness severity required thousands of patients to demonstrate a drug benefit 12 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1193, "end": 1194, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1268, "end": 1270, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1271, "end": 1273, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1443, "end": 1445, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1676, "end": 1678, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1679, "end": 1682, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1683, "end": 1685, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1941, "end": 1942, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2197, "end": 2199, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2589, "end": 2591, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ",2 *"}, {"text": "By contrast, predictive enrichment involves selecting patients who are more likely to respond to a given therapy on the basis of a biological mechanism 5,10,11 .

Instead, these strategies seek to group patients primarily on the basis of biological commonalities with the overarching goal of identifying patients likely to respond to a given therapeutic intervention. Efforts by investigative teams to subgroup patients with sepsis based on gene expression signatures have led to the development of four major classification systems, which are outlined below.

Progress towards this goal will not only require further study and validation of the existing proposed enrichment strategies, but, perhaps more importantly, it will also require the development of rapid assays that are conducive to bedside use in the fast-paced environment of the intensive care unit (ICU). With these limitations in mind, we describe in this section a few examples of enrichment for the purposes of sepsis clinical trial design. Some of these strategies have also been applied to observational data or secondary analyses of previous clinical trials, with existing examples also outlined below. The first clinical trial to utilize a quasi-predictive enrichment strategy for sepsis used a corticotropin stimulation test (also known as the adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test) to identify patients more likely to benefit from corticosteroid therapy 45 . Although the stimulation test results were not used in a prospective manner to guide therapy, in a pre-specified stratified analysis, corticotropin 'non-responders' who received hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone had reduced risk of death, whereas the corticotropin 'responders' did not benefit from hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. However, these results were not replicated in the follow-up CORTICUS trial 45, 46 . In another example, the MONARCHS trial tested the efficacy of an anti-TNF monoclonal antibody in patients with sepsis after enrichment based on blood concentrations of IL-6; patients with a greater degree of systemic inflammation were hypothesized to have higher circulating levels of IL-6 (reF. 47 ). The monoclonal antibody had no efficacy in the overall cohort or in the subgroup with lower IL-6 concentrations, but the researchers reported a marginal survival benefit among the subgroup with the highest IL-6 concentrations 47 . The ACROSS trial assessed the ability of acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol) to reduce oxidative injury in patients with severe sepsis. The investigators attempted to enrich the study cohort by selecting patients with detectable plasma cell-free haemoglobin, a marker of oxidative stress. Although acetaminophen did not reduce oxidative injury (as measured by F2-isoprostane levels) at treatment day 3, it did result in lower serum creatinine levels, suggesting that the treatment might have been potentially protective against sepsis-associated AKI 48 . The EUPHRATES trial used a rapid endotoxin assay to enrol patients with high endotoxin levels for randomization to standard therapy plus polymyxin B haemoperfusion or sham haemoperfusion 49 . Despite the a priori selection of patients with higher endotoxin concentrations, the use of polymyxin B haemoperfusion did not improve survival compared with the sham haemoperfusion group 49 . Finally, the SCARLET trial utilized the international normalized ratio and platelet count \u2500 two readily available laboratory tests \u2500 to identify patients with sepsis-associated coagulopathy who might benefit from recombinant human thrombomodulin therapy 50 . Unfortunately, despite this pragmatic predictive enrichment approach, treatment with thrombomodulin was not associated with reduced mortality 50 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1090, "end": 1092, "text": "45", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1506, "end": 1509, "text": "45,", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1510, "end": 1512, "text": "46", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1811, "end": 1813, "text": "47", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 2604, "end": 2606, "text": "48", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2796, "end": 2798, "text": "49", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 2989, "end": 2991, "text": "49", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 3248, "end": 3250, "text": "50", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 3395, "end": 3397, "text": "50", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Current use of enrichment strategies."}, {"text": "These landmark studies represent initial attempts to apply single biomarker-based enrichment strategies to conduct interventional clinical trials in sepsis.

This improved enrichment will become increasingly important as newer, more invasive and costly therapies are proposed.

However, subsequent studies examined the role of prognostic and predictive enrichment to retrospectively select subsets of patients more likely to benefit from corticosteroid treatment. In 2014, Funk and colleagues noted in a retrospective analysis of a multicentre study of low-dose corticosteroid administration in sepsis that patients with higher severity of illness scores who received steroids had lower mortality than an unselected group 57 . Another study attempted to utilize a similar prognostic enrichment approach and examined a large heterogeneous group of paediatric patients stratified by PERSEVERE mortality risk, but failed to demonstrate any benefit from treatment with corticosteroids among any of the PERSEVERE-based risk groups 58 . However, in a subsequent study, combining prognostic enrichment (PERSEVERE) with paediatric endotype A or B assignment enabled the retrospective identification of a subset of paediatric patients who seemed to benefit from treatment with corticosteroids 59 . In this study, endotype B patients with an intermediate to high baseline PERSEVERE mortality risk who received corticosteroids had a reduced risk of a complicated disease course compared with the other possible combinations of mortality risk and endotype assignments 59 . Similarly, a secondary analysis of the VANISH clinical trial utilized predictive enrichment to predict corticosteroid responsiveness. In this analysis, randomization to corticosteroids was associated with increased risk of mortality among patients allocated to SRS2 (reF. 36 ). Although these studies were limited by their post-hoc nature, this strategy of combining prognostic and predictive enrichment to select patients who may benefit from (or be harmed by) corticosteroids is an important model to be replicated in future studies, particularly when considering prospective trial design. Of note, the SHIPSS trial is an ongoing double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to test the efficacy of adjunctive hydrocortisone 60 .

Using a prognostic enrichment strategy, a study of a cohort of paediatric patients with septic shock found that positive fluid balance was associated with increased mortality among those with low baseline mortality risk, but not among those with moderate or high risk of mortality on admission 62 . Recombinant human activated protein C, which had been previously associated with reduced mortality but increased bleeding events in patients with severe sepsis 63 , was subsequently shown to be even more beneficial in patients with overt disseminated intravascular coagulation 64 . These findings indicate that identifying patients with DIC might represent a potential predictive enrichment strategy to select patients in whom the potential benefit of the therapy might outweigh the bleeding risk. Unfortunately, attempts at utilization of this enrichment strategy in subsequent prospective trials have failed to demonstrate a mortality benefit from treatment with recombinant human activated protein C, again suggesting that the enrichment strategy could not capture the biological complexity of sepsis 50, 65 .

Collaborations across investigative teams will need to include efforts to harmonize existing sepsis subgroups, bank specimens and share data, whereas collaborations with industry will be crucial to facilitate the development of rapid and readily available clinical assays. The importance of consensus sepsis subgrouping cannot be overstated and, although some efforts to analyse potential overlap among the four major subclassification systems outlined in this review have been made 23, 24, 35, 37 , the goal of harmonization has not yet been realized. However, as previously mentioned, attempts at gene expression-based subtyping of disease are not limited to sepsis and fields more advanced in their precision medicine approach have achieved this goal of consensus subclassification. A particularly perti nent example is colorectal cancer, a disease that at one time had six independent molecular classification systems that complicated both research and outcome tracking. An international consortium of experts was convened and, through large-scale data-sharing and collaboration, a consensus gene-expression-based subtyping system was developed, which has facilitated new research and allowed standardization of the molecular subclassification of colon cancer 100 .

This obstacle prompted researchers to test the feasibility of using smaller numbers of genes for patient subclassification 23, 30, 31, 102 . These simplified approaches appear to yield reliable classifications, but require further testing.

However, the gene expression patterns of circulating leukocytes might not accurately reflect the pattern of other relevant immune cells that are not practically accessible in critically ill patients (for example, alveolar macrophages, splenic lymphocytes or kidney immune cells) 101 , nor do they provide organ-specific gene expression information. Continued investigation of the biological mechanisms of sepsis will help us to ascertain what cells other than leukocytes might be relevant for analysis in patients with sepsis.

The timing of sepsis onset in a patient cannot be reliably known and experimental studies have demonstrated that genomic changes in response to endotoxin or other forms of inflammation are rapid and dynamic 109 . Therefore, when collecting samples at a particular time point after initial presentation with sepsis, each patient is likely to be at a different stage of sepsis, complicating the interpretation of data. Furthermore, that sample is representative of one particular moment in time, whereas changes in the genomic response to infection of a patient are ongoing. This concept was highlighted by two studies of children with sepsis, the first of which demonstrated significant variability in gene expression at different time points during the evolution of sepsis secondary to meningococcaemia 110 . The second study demonstrated that about one-third of children with septic shock change endotype over the first 3 days of admission 34 . As a result, the utilization of gene expression technology in sepsis will likely require sampling at various time points as a patient's sepsis mole cular signature on day 1 may not be the same as on day 3, a requirement that again highlights the importance of having rapid and cost-effective assays available for clinical use to enable serial measurements. Understanding of the importance of these temporal changes also led to the development of statistical methods to analyse gene expression data over time [111] [112] [113] [114] , as well as the utilization of dynamic mathematical models of critical illness 115, 116 . The Society for Complexity in Acute Illness was formed in 2004 in response to a growing understanding of the dynamic nature of critical illness and the need to develop strategies that enable modelling of changes over time to predict patient trajectories 116 . Although the specifics of these models are outside the scope of this review, this group has provided consensus guidelines for the use of dynamic mathematical modelling for biomedical research 116 . In particular, mechanistic modelling of sepsis molecular signatures might provide an avenue for overcoming the current technological limitations of single time point gene expression approaches (that is, failure to capture dynamic changes of gene expression) alluded to above 115 .
