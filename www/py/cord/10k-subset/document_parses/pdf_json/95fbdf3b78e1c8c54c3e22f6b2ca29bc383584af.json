To precisely determine the unfolding mechanism and the domain structure of Cyp, we have investigated a chimeric S. aureus Cyp (rCyp) using various probes. Our limited proteolysis and the consequent analysis of the proteolytic fragments indicate that rCyp is composed of one domain with a short flexible tail at the C-terminal end. We also show that the urea-induced unfolding of both rCyp and rCyp-CsA is completely reversible and proceeds via the synthesis of at least one stable intermediate. Both the secondary structure and the tertiary structure of each intermediate appears very similar to those of the corresponding native protein. Conversely, the hydrophobic surface areas of the intermediates are comparatively less. Further analyses reveal no loss of CsA binding activity in rCyp intermediate.

To confirm this proposition, we have individually performed limited proteolysis [51, [57] [58] [59] 61] of rCyp with trypsin, chymotrypsin, and proteinase K. Each of these enzymes is computationally determined to have higher than ten cleavage sites, which are distributed along the entire sequence of rCyp ( Fig 1A) . This protein will mostly remain insensitive to the above enzymes if it is really composed of only one domain. We have noted the generation of primarily one proteolytic fragment from rCyp at the initial stage of its cleavage with proteinase K (Fig 1B) . One major fragment was also made at the early period of digestion of rCyp with trypsin ( Fig 1C) or chymotrypsin (Fig 1D) . The proteinase K-, trypsin-and chymotrypsin-generated fragments are designated as fragment I, fragment II and fragment III, respectively. All of the fragments remained stable during the entire period of digestion. The intensities of the fragments were gradually increased with the increase of time of digestion. Their molecular masses are about~2-3 kDa less than that of rCyp, indicating that its digestion occurred differently by a different enzyme. While fragment I seemed to be produced by the cleavage at one or both ends of rCyp, fragment II was possibly originated due to the removal of any one of its end. On the other hand, fragment III might have been generated in an unconventional way. The peptide bonds formed by Phe, Tyr, and Trp residues are usually cleaved by chymotrypsin with high efficiency, whereas those are made with Leu, Met, and His residues are digested by this enzyme with less efficiency (web.expasy.org/peptide_cutter). All of the higher sensitive cut sites of chymotrypsin are located in the rCyp region that is made by its residues 52 to 183 ( Fig 1A) . As the removal of last 36 residues or the first 52 residues of rCyp by chymotrypsin would contribute to the mass loss of 4 kDa or more, fragment III might have been generated due to the cleavage at the less chymotrypsin-sensitive bonds at its ends.

Conversely, trypsin (S1B Fig)-or chymotrypsin (S1C Fig)- digested rCyp resulted in largely one major peak as expected. As the two peaks obtained from the proteinase K-digested rCyp were fused with each other, the fragment I might be composed of two proteolytic fragments (designated as Ia and Ib) having a little difference in molecular mass. The single major peak originated from the trypsin-digested rCyp most possibly corresponds to fragment II. Similarly, the peak yielded from the chymotrypsin-cleaved rCyp might be due to fragment III.

Previously, both rCyp and rCyp-CsA in the presence of GdnCl were unfolded via the production of one intermediate [42] . To check whether the urea-induced unfolding of these proteins would follow the similar pathway, their far-UV CD, intrinsic Trp fluorescence, and ANS fluorescence spectra were separately recorded in the presence of 0 to 7/8 M urea (S2 Fig) A monophasic curve is obtained for rCyp when the ellipticity values at 222 nm were plotted against the matching urea concentrations. Conversely, such a curve generated for rCyp-CsA was biphasic in nature (Fig 2A) . A monophasic curve for rCyp and a biphasic curve for rCyp-CsA were also obtained when we plotted their Trp fluorescence intensity (Fig 2B) or the associated \u03bb max (Fig 2C) values against the related urea concentrations. The \u03bb max values of both proteins were shifted to 350 nm when there was a saturation of fluorescence intensity.
