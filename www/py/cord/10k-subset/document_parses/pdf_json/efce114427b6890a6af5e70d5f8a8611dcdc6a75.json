If not cleared, apoptotic neutrophils are postulated to release histotoxic granular contents. Since numerous cellular proteins are degraded during apoptosis, we sought to determine whether functional serine proteinases are indeed released by apoptosing neutrophils in vitro. In a coculture system, eytokine-aetirated neutrophils induced detachment in the human epithelial cell line, A549. This process was CD18-and serine proteinase-dependent. Early apoptotic neutrophils induced significant detachment, but live, senescent, resting neutrophils and terminal, secondary necrotic neutro-C.Y.L. and Y.H.L contributed equally to the work on this project as first authors. phils had a different effect. This detachment process was CD18-independent but serine proteinase-dependent. Similarly, detachment occurred with primary human small airway epithelial cells. Notably, epithelial cell detachment correlated with the transition of early apoptotic neutrophils to secondary necrosis and with the accumulation of elastase in the supernatant. The membrane integrity of lung epithelial cells was damaged in advance of significant cell detachment. These observations suggest that not only live activated neutrophils but also apoptosing neutrophils can reveal functional elastase activities. Furthermore, the rapidity of the transition emphasizes the importance of the prompt clearance of apoptotic neutrophils before they progress to secondary necrosis at the site of lung inflammation.",

However, abundant literature documents the potential hazards of these proteolytic enzymes in the pathogenesis of inflammatory organ injury. Circulating mature human neutrophils are committed to die, even when their life spans are prolonged by various endogenous and exogenous factors. Apoptotic neutrophils are recognized by professional phagocytes and semiprofessional phagocytic parenchymal cells. Although definitive in vivo studies are lacking, apoptosing neutrophils are postulated to be removed without further augmentation of the existing inflammation [49, 50] . This process is believed to be rapid, efficient and important during the resolution phase of inflammation [10, 19] . Coincident with the highly controlled process of neutrophil apoptosis is the shutdown of the degranulation response [24] . If not phagocytosed, apoptotic neutrophils will undergo secondary necrosis, an end-stage cellular disintegration characterized by breached membrane integrity. Consequently, proteinases residing in apoptotic neutrophils may be passively released and, in turn, contribute to tissue injury.",

However, several factors associated with chronic inflammatory diseases can markedly inhibit the ability of macrophages to recognize and engulf apoptotic neutrophils. For example, a number of granulocyte enzymes with an extracellular presence in inflammatory diseases are extremely cationic [41] . These cationic molecules, along with a low pH, are common features of chronic inflammation and have been demonstrated to significantly inhibit recognition of apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages [50] . In patients with cystic fibrosis, Pseudornonas aeruginosa products have been reported to inhibit macrophage phagocytosis [36, 37] . Moreover, the ability of alveolar macrophages to phagocytose apoptotic neutrophils was found to be significantly impaired in smoke inhalation injury, a condition associated with a high incidence of both bacterial pneumonia and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [26] , and in children suffering recurrent respiratory tract infections [43] . Other investigations have suggested that macrophages which had previously ingested apoptotic cells subsequently have impaired ingestion capacity [ 18] . In this situation, apoptotic neutrophils can undergo secondary necrosis, presumably resulting in the release of histotoxic granular contents [52] . If the proteinases released remain functional, they can then escalate the inflammatory response and exacerbate lung injury. Surprisingly, few studies have examined the release of functional proteinases from apoptotic neutrophils.",

Among these, elastase is the major proteinase, and has been demonstrated to be critical in neutrophil-mediated tissue injury and extracellular proteolysis [1, 8, 34, 40] . Previous studies showed that serine proteinase inhibitors blocked A549 cell detachment induced by activated neutrophils, and that exogenous elastase restored this detachment [3] . Because the disruption and desquamation of airway and lung epithelial cells have been widely observed in a variety of immunological, infectious and inflammatory pulmonary diseases [2, 8, 10, 23] , we used lung epithelial cell detachment as a bioassay in this study [9] to investigate the effect of early apoptotic neutrophils on airway epithelial cells and the role of elastase activity in causing the effect. Because CD 18 is a f~2 integrin subunit critical to the firm adhesion and the subsequent degranulation response of activated neutrophils [5, 57] , and because apoptotic neutrophils have been demonstrated to accumulate CD 18 on the cell surface [16] , we also investigated the role of the integrin CD 18 in the cytotoxic effect of apoptosing neutrophils.",

In separate dose-response experiments using purified human neutrophil elastase, it was observed that a threshold concentration of 1.25 pg/ml was required to induce significant A549 cell detachment within 6 h. In our experiments, elastase activity in the supernatant of the annexin V-selected fraction reached this level after only 4 h. Although the annexin V-negatively selected flow-through fraction also released elastase, the level of its activity was below the threshold concentration ( fig. 8A, B) .",

Once recruited to an inflammatory site, neutrophit life spans were demonstrated to be extended ex vivo [ 14, 35] . Notwithstanding, mature neutrophils are committed to undergoing apoptosis. Apoptosis is an intracellular remodeling process with initially limited autoproteolysis and oligonucleosomal cleavage which is accompanied by downrcgulation ofneutrophil inflammatory responses [29, 30, 59] . This process eventually leads to cellular disintegration, with the breach in cellular membrane integrity (secondary necrosis). Although histotoxic neutrophilic granular contents have been widely stated to be released under this scenario, an exhaustive literature search yielded surprisingly few peerreviewed original studies that characterized the release of functional proteinase activities from these shrinking, autoproteolysing neutrophits. Utilizing annexin V-conjugated paramagnetic beads that selectively bind to exposed cell surface phosphatidylserine residues present on apoptotic but not live neutrophils [22, 31, 55] , this study revealed more accelerated release of functional elastase activity from predominantly early apoptotic neutrophils, compared to that from predominantly live, senescent, resting neutrophils. Furthermore, the timing of this release correlates with the progression of early apoptotic neutrophils to secondary necrosis and lung epithelial cell detachment in vitro. Thus, this study clearly confirms that resting apoptosing neutrophils release functional elastase activity in vitro.",

Alternatively, the rapid transition from early apoptosis to apoptotic body-tbrmation, secondary necrosis and eventual total cellular disintegration may lead to a certain degree of underestimation.

This important observation implies that the balance between neutrophil apoptosis and their phagocytic clearance can be disturbed. Indeed, this possibility is supported by two further ex vivo studies that specifically verified the functional impairment of alveolar macrophages, both in clearing apoptotic neutrophils in children suffering from recurrent respiratory tract infections, and in an animal model of experimental smoke inhalation injury [26, 43] . Although this study used a lung epithelial cell detachment assay as an in vitro bioassay to characterize the serine proteinases released from dying neutrophils, the biological effects of neutrophil proteinases are wide-ranging. For example, besides a direct role of neutrophil proteinases in experimental lung injury [23, 38, 45] , elastase can activate neutrophil matrix metalloproteinase-9 [21] , which is capable of solubilizing the human alveolar extracellular matrix [ 15, 42] and is increased in epithelial lining fluid from patients with ARDS [38] . Cathepsin G can also augment inflammation through platelet activation via pmteinase-activated receptor-4 activation [47] . Furthermore, neutrophil elastase and a-defensins can stimulate lung epithelial cell production of IL-8 and/or GM-CSF in vitro [39, 54] . Conceivably, during the resolution phase of an acute inflammatory insult, functional proteinases released from apoptosing neutrophils that have escaped timely phagocytic clearance may perpetuate inflammation and contribute to tissue injury.",

            "text": "In conclusion, this study demonstrates that apoptosing neutrophils release, at least, functional elastase activity during secondary necrosis and induce a cytotoxic effect on airway epithelial cells. As this process is rapid, our results indicate that neutrophil apoptosis may not necessarily be benign, and emphasize the importance of removal of these disintegrating cells promptly by phagocytic cells. Clearly, further study is needed to explore the molecular mechanisms of epithelial celt detachment induced by apoptotic neutrophils and to document the occurrence of neutrophil apoptosis and the kinetics of apoptotic neutrophil removal in various disease states. Finally, our results suggest that a therapeutic strategy for inducing granulocyte apoptosis en masse so as to attenuate active lung inflammation should consider the simultaneous enhancement of clearance mechanisms for apoptosing granulocytes.",
