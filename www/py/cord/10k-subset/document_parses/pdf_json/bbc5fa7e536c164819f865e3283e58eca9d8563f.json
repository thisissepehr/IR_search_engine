The field of VCA has entered its second decade with an increasing experience in both the impressive good outcomes, as well as defining challenges, risks, and experienced poor results. The limited and selective publishing of negative outcomes in this relatively new field makes it difficult to conclusively evaluate outcomes of graft and patient survival and morbidities. Therefore, published data, conference proceedings, and communications were summarized in an attempt to provide a current outline of complications. These data on the medical complications of VCA should allow for precautions to avoid poor outcomes, data to better provide informed consent to potential recipients, and result in improvements in graft and patient outcomes as VCA finds a place as a therapeutic option for selected patients.",

Since then, an estimated 32 face transplants have been done worldwide and 75 patients were recipients of 111 upper extremity transplants [3] [4] [5] [6] . The benefits of vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) are both functional and cosmetic. VCA immunological, functional, psychological, and aesthetic outcomes have been reported and have demonstrated objective successes [7] [8] [9] [10] . Nonetheless, these transplants are associated with a unique set of characteristics and complications in addition to the better defined risks of transplantation. VCA has also expanded to other grafts including lower extremity, abdominal wall, uterus, larynx, penis, and other composite tissues. These transplants are few in number and less well-described; therefore, this review will focus on upper extremity and facial transplantation.",

The status of VCA as an emerging field with a distinctly different population from SOT warrants continuous review and discussion of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Complications can be best avoided by a thorough screening processes and the implementation of OPTN/UNOS approved criteria for VCA donors [24] . Early transplants driven by limited outcome data had strict inclusion/exclusion criteria for both donors and recipients. This reserved approach was warranted, especially in the early, uncharted experience of facial transplantation, with the threat of graft failure resulting in nonreconstructable defects (or death), and in fact, the first 11 face transplants were partial transplants [3, 25] . With progression of the field and the emergence of good results similar to SOT, recipient exclusion criteria have been loosened to include blind patients, self-inflicted injuries, oncologic defects, bilateral upper extremities, multiple VCA's (extremity with face), HIV positive patients, pre-sensitized patients, and other complex issues on a case by case basis [16, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Many of these have had good outcomes, though concurrent bilateral hand and face transplantation, positive HIV status, and CMV mismatch have had poor outcomes to date and are advised against by many in the field [3, 16, 17, 28, 31] .",

As an extreme example, a report from China described 15 hand allotransplants in 12 patients with graft failure requiring removal in seven patients; six of these were due to severe rejection after cessation of immunosuppression and lack of access to medications [21] . This early experience highlights that VCA requires medication compliance and lifelong commitment from both the patient and the medical teams' perspective. Given the various traumatic mechanisms of injury involved in many of these cases, patients may also be suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, depression, and social marginalization, which must all be well controlled pre-and post-transplantation [32] . The observed associations of VCA recipients' mechanism of injury with PTSD requires increased attention to ongoing mental health therapy, with specific regards to associated depression and substance abuse history. Ongoing psychiatric and psychologic care may be necessary to prevent medical noncompliance or illness secondary to PTSD, depression, and substance abuse (including both alcohol and tobacco). Additionally, ethical concerns not limited to informed consent, donor confidentiality, lack of coercion, and societal burden of costs must be thoroughly addressed, with the definite understanding that sustained life-long care will be needed [33] [34] [35] .",

            "text": "Higher transfusion requirements were necessary in recipients with extensive neurofibromatosis or whole face burns in contrast to more limited pathology. Associated hemodynamic instability required vasopressors in many cases. This requirement is concerning for the possibility of vasoconstriction leading to thrombosis in microsurgical flaps, although evidence for this phenomenon is inconsistent [38, 39] . Paralleling these concerns, high transfusion rates with hemoglobin levels >10 g/dL were undesirable due to elevated viscosity and microanastomotic thrombotic risk. Two cases of facial vein thrombosis have been reported, with one requiring reoperation [36] . Severe graft edema is present in most face transplant patients after receiving a median of 13 l of crystalloid. A more theoretical concern associated with allogeneic transfusion requirements is transfusion immunomodulation (TRIM) [40] . Although allogeneic transfusions have historically been associated with improved renal transplantation outcomes, no routine transfusion practices have been applied or demonstrated as necessary in transplantation. Nonetheless, transfusions likely increase rates of postoperative bacterial infections [40] [41] [42] [43] . Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion is associated with higher risk of nosocomial infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia [44] . Allogeneic leukocytes may be the responsible mechanism, thus routine leukoreduction of blood products for transplant recipients may minimize these effects [40] . Severe respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome have been described in facial transplant recipients, where the median FFP transfusion is 20 units [36] . Many of these complications do not translate directly to upper extremity transplantation as transfusion and vasopressor requirements are considerably lower, although not as clearly reported in the literature [45, 46] . However, multiple cases of venous and arterial thrombosis in upper extremity allografts have been described and have required urgent surgical intervention to salvage these at risk grafts [47] .",

In VCA, however, only acute rejection has been clearly defined. Banff criteria for VCA acute rejection have been developed and applied; although, these only apply to the skin component and continue to be discussed for ongoing modifications [49] [50] [51] . More recently, chronic rejection has been described as graft vasculopathy, although strict criteria are as yet being developed without universal consensus [14, 18, 22\u2022, 52, 53] . Due to the heterogeneous composition of VCA tissues (i.e., skin, muscle, bone, nerve, and vessels,), rejection of one component may not equate to rejection of other tissues within the allograft [54] . The potential discordance between the histopathology of different VCA tissues and the context of clinical presentation result in significant clinical variation in the response to a diagnosis of rejection and choice of immunosuppressive therapy [6, 55, 56] . Potential overtreatment of mild VCA rejection as observed in face and hand transplantation may occur because of the obvious visibility of the graft as compared to SOT. All these clinical and histological factors affect the diagnosis of VCA rejection and subsequent treatment [6, 55, 56] .",

These cases are not progressive and have generally been treated with options including increased levels of existing immunosuppression and steroids, topical agents, antithymocyte globulin, Campath-1H, or other monoclonal biologic therapies [3] . Rates of acute rejection in solid organ transplant are much lower with approximately 10 % of patients having an episode of acute rejection during the first year for renal transplants and 15 % for liver transplants [58] [59] [60] . Given the high rate of acute rejection in VCA as compared to SOT, these rejection episodes and the treatments have been relatively well documented despite the short history of VCA transplantation [61, 62] .",

Preclinical models and isolated case reports in hand and knee transplantation predicted the appearance of chronic rejection as a clinical entity [22, 50, 51, 63, 64] . The features noted in these studies have included transplant vasculopathy with intimal hyperplasia in deep and medium-sized vessels, basal cell layer vacuolization and necrosis of the epidermis, tertiary lymphoid follicles, graft fibrosis, and edema. A more recent summary of cases from Louisville has shown newer findings of capillary thrombosis in two cases of hand transplantation after multiple episodes of acute rejection in one case and development of donor specific antibodies (DSAb) in another, with development of DSAb after removal of the graft in a second case [52] . The mechanism of capillary thrombosis is not thought to be antibody mediated rejection (AMR); yet, AMR has been seen de novo in a hand allograft and in a pre-sensitized patient in face transplantation [30, 65, 66] . No clinical cases of AMR with C4d deposition have been described in non-presensitized face transplant recipients, although chronic rejection with C4d deposition has been seen in a preclinical non-human primate model [67] . Other preclinical models have not associated the development of chronic rejection with either DSAb of C4d positivity. Nonetheless, there are multiple VCA patients who have developed DSAb post-transplant, and emerging data suggests an association of DSAb with poor graft outcomes and loss.",

Although initial treatment with rituximab was successful, EBV-associated post-transplant smooth muscle tumors developed in the liver requiring additional reduction of immunosuppression. Eventually scleroderma-like features with dyschromic aspects, resembling chronic GVHD, developed in the patient. Histology demonstrated a thin, atrophic, keratotic epidermis, with a sclerotic dermis, atrophy of epidermal adnexa and capillaries with thickened collagenous walls with reduced lumina. These studies indicate that new findings including epidermal and dermal thinning, sclerosis, and atrophy will be included as new cases of chronic rejection are defined in VCA grafts followed over a longer periods of time.",

Complications have also been seen in face transplantation including development of hyperglycemia, SIADH, osteoporosis leading to vertebral fractures, hypertension, and nephrotoxicity leading to acute and chronic renal failure [9, 13] . Most of these are side effects of various pharmacological therapies required for immunosuppression or antimicrobial therapy. However, renal dysfunction can progress from acute to chronic with the use of calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus), prompting many groups to switch to mTOR inhibitors such as sirolimus and everolimus [66] , including one case where conversion to belatacept and sirolimus was successful when the patient was facing multiple rejection episodes with renal failure [84] . In some cases, mTOR inhibitor conversions or the addition of belatacept resulted in episodes of rejection, indicating that development of suitable immunosuppression regimens is an ongoing endeavor [66, 85] . Experimental therapies involving donor bone marrow infusions have taken place in hopes of reducing or eliminating the required amounts of immunosuppression; however, tolerance has not been achieved and any other benefits are unclear due to the limited number of cases [86, 87\u2022\u2022] . At the current time, the individual case of renal transplantation and multiple cases of immunosuppressive therapy changes in efforts to preserve renal function highlight the necessity of screening candidates for adequate renal function to tolerate calcineurin inhibitor therapy.",

Graft function is poorly defined in face transplantation, where the value of the allograft is often primarily cosmetic and only secondarily functional: blink protection, olfaction, and mastication.

The fourth mortality was reported from Mexico in a patient who died immediately after an attempted bilateral hand transplantation [98] . In contrast to facial VCA, upper extremity transplantation has a much lower mortality rate estimated at 1 % for 1-year outcomes with isolated upper extremity and 4 % overall mortality.

However, VCA remains an experimental field without widespread consensus as a standard of care [99] , though the recent addition of VCAs to regulatory oversight of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network in 2014 as well as databases such as the International Registry on Hand and Composite Tissue Transplantation will bring some transparency to this field as reporting of outcomes especially complications has been incomplete [57, [100] [101] [102] [103] . Inclusion in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients could also pave the way for more cohesive cataloging of methods and outcomes. While reasonably safe VCA does have measurable risks of morbidity, graft loss, and patient death, many of which are related to chronic immunosuppression. Further efforts to reduce complications and increase acceptance of VCA as a life-changing (but not life-saving) procedure depend on continued research into identifying and developing approaches to minimize these complications.",
