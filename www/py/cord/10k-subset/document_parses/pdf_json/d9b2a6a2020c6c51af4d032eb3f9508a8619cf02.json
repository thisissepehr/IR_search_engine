Grace & Co. obtained patents for a method of extracting neem 2 and exercised them to force Indian companies dealing with neem to buy its technology, which led to a worldwide campaign against those patents. Another example involves an extremophile used as an ingredient in detergent and for bleaching jeans.

In return, Indonesia will receive technical support and will be able to produce the vaccine under license and export it in the future. This move was due to Indonesia's dissatisfaction with the \"unfairness\" of having to purchase expensive vaccines created by a developed nation based on samples provided by one's own country, but it was criticized by the WHO, which said that the agreement would \"upset the worldwide virus sharing network arrangement.\" The incident has made clear that even a pathogenic virus can have the characteristics of a strategic material and can become a bargaining chip between governments.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), which came into effect in 1993, reflects these sorts of situations. The CBD was originally intended to preserve biological diversity, but its objectives also include the implementation of fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources. With regard to the handling of genetic resources, the CBD stipulates that each country has sovereign rights over its natural resources (Article 15, Paragraph 1), that access to genetic resources requires prior informed consent (PIC) of the contracting state providing the resources (Article 15, Paragraph 5), and that measures shall be taken with the aim of sharing in a fair and equitable way the results of research and development based on genetic resources, and the benefits arising from the commercial and other use of genetic resources, with the The CBD recognizes the sovereign right of countries over their genetic resources.

This request stipulated that the proceeding should be halted if the country of origin was not disclosed before the grant of the patent and that patents can be invalidated or transferred if incomplete or false information is discovered after patent grant.

With regard to disclosing the country of origin of genetic resources in patent specifications, the JPO and the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) have also stated the opinion that imposing new filing requirements would increase the burden on the applicant and could lead to a loss of incentive to file and that such regulations should not be made within the patent law.

The Indian Biological Diversity Act states that approval of the National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) is necessary for foreign companies to access biological resources in India for research or survey purposes, as well as for anyone to provide the results of research obtained on the biological resources in India to foreign companies or researchers. Furthermore, for inventions based on information or research results obtained on the basis of biological resources acquired in India, all applicants need the NBA's approval before filing for any intellectual property rights, within or outside India.

When acquiring genetic resources, priority is given to the point that the resource be obtained legally, with PIC of the country of origin. When genetic resources are acquired directly from the country of origin, PIC is obtained from the government and PAT E N T S stakeholders in accordance with that country's laws. Furthermore, when supplying resources in its possession to other institutions for research purposes, Kew prohibits commercial use of those resources by means of a standard Material Supply Agreement (MSA) and requires a separate contract specifying fair and equitable benefit sharing with the country of origin if a resource is to be commercialized. In Japan, the National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NITE) works on the collection, preservation and use primarily of microorganisms and has preserved over 25,000 microorganisms 11 . When making a deposit, depositors must guarantee, in an Agreement for Depository of Biological Resources, that they have proper authority with respect to the deposited biological resource. The accession form used for deposits requires that the source of isolation and country of origin be specified. Furthermore, NITE has signed joint research agreements with research institutes of these various countries and built partnerships on this basis. This has made it possible for NITE to acquire biological resources while complying with the CBD. With regard to commercial use of genetic resources, an arrangement has been adopted whereby the microorganism usage fees paid by each company are split in half between the country of origin and NITE, and milestones and royalties will be received when patenting or product development is accomplished.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Approaches to the Convention on Biological Diversity at biological and genetic resource institutions"}, {"text": "Furthermore ", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Approaches to the Convention on Biological Diversity at biological and genetic resource institutions"}, {"text": "So what sort of framework is desirable when it comes to the collection of and access to genetic resources and the obtainment of PIC and benefit sharing?
