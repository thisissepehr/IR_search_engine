Thus, the New Delhi conference appealed to the global community to begin to address broader issues around the emergence and spread of HPAI and other emerging infectious diseases through international partnerships (Press Information Bureau of the Government of India 2007). Each Government should encourage functional links between human and animal health systems, while investing in sustainable capacity for preventing and controlling high impact diseases in animals.",

The Strategic Framework was the joint product of six major international organizations: the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank, and the United Nations System Influenza Coordination (UNSIC). The strategic framework for reducing risks of infectious diseases at the animal-human-ecosystem interfaces was presented at the ministerial conference. The document sets out six priority objectives for countries to consider, such as developing capacity in surveillance, promoting interagency and cross-sectoral partnerships, and ensuring functioning national emergency response capacity (Contributing to One World 2008). The application of a One Health approach aims not only to minimize the local and global impact of epidemics and pandemics caused by emerging infectious diseases, but also to look at more holistic approaches for solving health-related problems in line with International Health Regulations (2005) .",

The scope, priority, and approaches may be different in public health and animal health institutions and therefore it will be necessary to promote integrated and/or coordinated approaches for the implementation of 'One Health'. It was recognized that animal health sector is weak in terms of surveillance and response for emerging and high impact diseases and therefore more investment will be required for strengthening animal health services in developing countries. Indeed, the veterinary public health service is rudimentary in most developing countries and it is estimated that USD 1.3 billion will be required annually to implement a One Health approach until 2020 (http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTAVIANFLU/ Resources/3124440-1172616490974/Fifth_Global_Progress_Report_July_2010.pdf). The technical discussions held for operationalizing One Health, from ideas to action in Winnipeg (2009) and Stone Mountain (2010), have encouraged academics, donors, and partners to synthesize concrete action points for pushing 'One Health' movement to a higher level. A high level technical meeting, jointly organized by FAO, OIE, and WHO, was held in Cancun in November 2011 to address health risks at human-animal-ecosystem interfaces, and identified key elements, high priority technical actions, and related practical next steps for moving forward on intersectoral collaboration, coordination, and communication (World Bank 2010).",

However, discovering novel agents in wildlife does not imply that they will be associated with human or livestock diseases; only when sudden disease outbreaks or epidemics arise and they are shown to be the cause do we acknowledge their role, such as in filoviruses, SARS, Nipah, and pandemic influenza virus.

Similarly, rabies, plague, and leptospirosis are major zoonotic diseases of public health concern which are transmitted by dogs and rodents but they have little impact on livestock production or animal health.

Antimicrobial and agro-chemical substances are indiscriminately used to boost agricultural and livestock production to feed an ever-increasing human population and fast growing livestock and poultry farming, but they are responsible not only for depleting natural resources but also for microbial and chemical hazards to human, animal, plant life, and to the environment.
