Functional impairment of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is associated with inflammatory retinal diseases. Enhancing the protective axis namely ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas by activation of ACE2 presents anti-inflammatory properties. We investigated whether diminazene aceturate (DIZE), an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activator, prevented lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory response by activating the protective axis and whether the effect was mediated by inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) pathways. Methods: Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and real-time PCR were used to determine the optimum concentration and incubation time of DIZE. ARPE-19 cells and primary cultured human retinal pigment epithelia (hRPE) were incubated with or without 10 \u03bcg/mL DIZE for 6 h before stimulated with 5 \u03bcg/mL LPS for 24 h. The mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines, AT1R, and AT2R was analyzed. The protein level of inflammatory cytokines, Ang II, and Ang-(1-7) was detected. Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and phosphorylated transcription inhibition factor-\u03baB-\u03b1 (p-I\u03baB-\u03b1) were measured. Inhibitors of MAPKs and NF-\u03baB were added to verify the involvement of these pathways. A small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted to ACE2 and a selective Ang-(1-7) antagonist A779 was used to confirm the role of ACE2 and the involvement of ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis. Results: DIZE remarkably increased the expression of ACE2 and inhibited the expression of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 at both mRNA and protein levels in both RPE cell lines stimulated with LPS. Inhibitors of p38, ERK1/2, JNK, and NF-\u03baB significantly decreased LPS-induced overproduction of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1. DIZE reduced the expression of Ang II and AT1R, whereas increased Ang-(1-7). Furthermore, DIZE downregulated the phosphorylation of p38MAPK, ERK1/ 2, JNK, and the activation of NF-\u03baB upon stimulation with LPS. Downregulating ACE2 and pre-treatment with A779 abrogated the effects of DIZE on production of cytokines, the expression of Ang II, Ang-(1-7), AT1R, phosphorylation of MAPKs and activation of NF-\u03baB.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Conclusions: DIZE inhibits LPS-induced inflammatory response by activating ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis in human RPE cells.

The malfunction of tissue intrinsic RAS is involved in the pathogenesis of vascular [2] , pulmonary [3] and ocular diseases [4] . Angiotensin II (Ang II) is a vital molecular regulator of RAS. It is generated through sequential enzymatic catalysis by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) from angiotensinogen. Ang II has two receptors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and AT2R. It has been proved that Ang II plays the deleterious roles through its receptor AT1R. Several studies demonstrated that the harmful axis of RAS, i.e., the ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis was involved in several retinal diseases [4, 5] . Therapeutic intervention targeted to this axis showed remarkable protective effects. AT1R blocker (ARB) suppressed retinal neural dysfunction and downregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in animal models of acute retinal inflammation [6] . In addition, oral administration of ARB prevented the progression of diabetic retinopathy by attenuating infiltration of leukocytes in the retina and delays the development of diabetic retinopathy [7] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 180, "end": 183, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 381, "end": 384, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 397, "end": 400, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 421, "end": 424, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 897, "end": 900, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 901, "end": 903, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1158, "end": 1161, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1361, "end": 1364, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a newly found component of RAS, is an enzymatic homologue of ACE.

DIZE treatment also decreased the expression of Ang II, AT1R but increased Ang-(1-7). Meanwhile, we found that the MAPK and NF-\u03baB pathways were involved in the LPS-induced overproduction of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1.

Taking together, we suggest that the protective effects of DIZE on LPS-induced inflammatory response were mediated by activating the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis and by inhibiting the MAPK and NF-\u03baB pathways. RAS is considered traditionally a blood-pressureregulating system. Whereas, increasing evidence suggests that it is also important in regulating inflammatory responses. Hyperactivation of the ocular intrinsic RAS contributes to an upregulation of ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis and a downregulation of ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis. It has been proposed to be critical in the development of various vision-threatening diseases [4] , such as diabetic retinopathy, AMD, and uveitis. Ang II, the main effector molecule of RAS, contributes to the inflammatory process by increasing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and cell adhesion molecules, growth factors, and reactive oxygen species through the AT1R [40] . There is a direct evidence that abnormal production of Ang II in RPE would lead to retinal dysfunction and breakdown of blood-retinal barrier [41] . Ang II was capable of weakening the tight junction of blood-retinal barrier and increasing invasion of the choroidal endothelial cells [42] . On the other hand, AT1R blockers and ACE inhibitors have been shown to decrease the expression of inflammatory cytokines and suppress ocular inflammation [43] as well as vascular inflammation [44] .

A possible explanation is A779 is the antagonist of Ang-(1-7). It blocks the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis, but cannot reduce the expression of ACE2. ACE2 is capable to convert Ang II to Ang-(1-7), thus decrease Ang II and ultimately reduce the expression of AT1R. However, the mRNA expression of AT2R was not affected by any of the treatments. There might be two possibilities. On the one hand, there are large amount of AT2R expressed in the embryonic tissue, but the expression is less in the adult tissues. Either the LPS stimulation will not cause dramatically changes of AT2R expression, or it may not be involved in the LPSinduced response in RPE cells. On the other hand, there is evidence showing when AT1R is blocked, circulating Ang II binds, and activates AT2R only [46] . When the cells are exposed to LPS, Ang II is increased and binds to AT1R, thus the AT2R will not be bound or activated.

Moreover, in response to inflammatory stimuli, inflammatory response is orchestrated by initiating a series of intracellular signaling cascades and ultimately leads to release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Prominent cascades among these intracellular signaling pathways include MAPK and NF-\u03baB pathways.

Therefore, all of the three MAPK family members were involved in the LPS-induced inflammatory response in RPE cells. We also showed that DIZE remarkably decreased the phosphorylation of p38MAPK, JNK, and ERK1/2 in response to LPS, whereas ACE2-siRNA and A779 abolished the protective effect of DIZE. Thus, we suggested that DIZE protected against LPS-induced inflammation through the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis by modulating the phosphorylation of p38MAPK, JNK, and ERK1/2.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 228, "end": 232, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 407, "end": 414, "text": "Fig. 11", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The NF-\u03baB pathway is pivotal to the inflammatory response. NF-\u03baB normally resides in the cytoplasm as an inactive form complex with an inhibitor namely Fig. 12 Effect of ACE2-siRNA on the phosphorylation of MAPKs and the activation of NF-\u03baB in ARPE-19. The protein levels of p-p38, p-JNK, p-ERK1/2, p38, JNK, ERK1/2 (a) and p-I\u03baB-\u03b1 (b) were determined by Western blotting. The band intensity of p-p38, p-JNK, and p-ERK1/2 was normalized to p38, JNK, and ERK1/2, respectively. The band intensity of p-I\u03baB-\u03b1 was normalized to \u03b2-actin. DIZE reduced the phosphorylation of p38, JNK, and ERK1/2 and I\u03baB-\u03b1 induced by LPS, while ACE2-siRNA abolished DIZE's effect.

External stimuli activate NF-\u03baB transcription, lead to the phosphorylation of I\u03baB-\u03b1, and increase the degradation of I\u03baB by proteosome [49] . NF-\u03baB is activated and translocated into the nucleus to upregulate the transcription of several inflammatory genes. Many in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that activation of NF-\u03baB is the key link in regulating the LPS-induced inflammatory response [39, 50] . Inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling reduced the pro-inflammatory cytokines production in LPS-induced uveitis and in RPE cells [51] . Here, we confirmed that LPS increased the activation of NF-\u03baB in RPE cells, and the specific inhibitor of NF-\u03baB significantly decreased the pro-inflammatory cytokines generation. Our results proved that the NF-\u03baB signaling was involved in LPS-induced inflammatory response in ARPE-19 cells. More interestingly, we found that DIZE remarkably suppressed the activation of NF-\u03baB induced by LPS. In addition, ACE2-siRNA and pre-treatment of A779 abrogated the inhibition effect of DIZE on NF-\u03baB pathway, suggesting that the beneficial effect of DIZE on LPS-induced inflammation was through modulating the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis by down-regulating the activation of NF-\u03baB pathway.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 919, "end": 923, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1182, "end": 1186, "text": "[39,", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1187, "end": 1190, "text": "50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1310, "end": 1314, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 152, "end": 159, "text": "Fig. 12", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, we demonstrate that by activating the protective axis of RAS, ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas, DIZE exerts protective effects on LPS-induced inflammatory response in hRPE and ARPE-19 cells.
