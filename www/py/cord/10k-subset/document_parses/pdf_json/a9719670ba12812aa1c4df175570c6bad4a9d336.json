A second analysis was performed for resting tone >25mmHg, the 75th percentile. Outcomes included 1 and 5 minute APGAR <7, level II or III nursery admission, cesarean delivery, and neonatal acidemia. Poisson regression was used to adjust for relevant confounders. RESULTS: Of 4890 eligible laboring women, 2565 (52%) had a baseline resting tone >20mmHg, and 1347 (28%) had a baseline resting tone >25mmHg. Women with a resting tone >20 were more likely to have a 5 minute APGAR <7 (aRR 1.66, CI 1.11-2.49); but, the overall rate was low occurring in 75 (3%) infants. There was no difference in the 1 minute APGAR <7, level II or III nursery admission, acidemia, or rate of cesarean. The resting tone group >25mmHg had higher rates of 1 and 5 Minute APGARs <7 (aRR 1.23, CI 1.01-1.49; aRR 1.92, CI 1.32-2.79), but otherwise resting tone >25mmHg did not impact outcomes. Sensitivity analyses limited to women with an IUPC revealed identical results. methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor 5-Aza-dC and HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A for 24 h. The expression levels of genes were measured by Real-time PCR in both tissues and primary cells. RESULTS: Quantitative PrimePCR array indicated that more than twenty genes were significantly down regulatedincluding RAD51, BRCA1, and BRCA2. In contrast, CHEK1 and RAD9A were significantlyup-regulated in F compared to Myo. Interestingly, the expression levels of RAD51, BRCA1, and BRCA2 were also downregulated in F primary cells compared to Myo primary cells. In contrast to the effect of Trichostatin A treatment, treatment with DNMT inhibitor 5-Aza-dC markedly increased the expression levels of RAD51 and BRCA1 in F primary cells, suggesting that DNMT activity plays an important role in regulating the expression pattern of DNA repair genes in uterine fibroids. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired expression patterns of DNA repair signaling occur in uterine fibroids, which may lead to failure to repair DNA damage and therefore result in DNA instability. DNA hypermethylation is likely involved in the regulation of DNA damage repair related genes. Further investigation is warranted in determining the role epigenetic regulation plays in DNA damage signaling pathways with respect to uterine fibroid formation.",

However, there was no statistically significant effect of stretch when explants were incubated with retosiban (P=0.3 & 0.2, respectively). In low stretch, incubation with retosiban had no statistically significant effect on the response to either KCl or oxytocin (P=0.8 & >0.9, respectively). In high stretch, incubation in retosiban resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the response to both KCl (0.74, 0.60-1.03, P=0.046) and oxytocin (0.71, 0.53-0.91, P=0.008). The greater the effect of stretch on explants from a given patient, the greater was the reduction in response induced by retosiban in high stretch (r= -0.65 P=0.02 for KCl and r= -0.73, P=0.007 for oxytocin).

Obstetrics and Gynecology, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA. INTRODUCTION: Maternal cigarette smoking is a well-established risk factor for fetal growth restriction (FGR) and is also associated with elevated fetoplacental vascular resistance. Nicotine, often considered a central culprit in adverse effects of smoking, has been shown to have beneficial effects on endothelial cell (EC) function. In contrast, the role of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), abundant toxins in cigarette smoke that activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway, has not been investigated in human fetoplacental ECs. METHODS: Human placental villous ECs were primarily isolated (N=3), cultured, and treated with vehicle or benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), a key PAH in cigarette smoke. ECs were subjected to qRT-PCR, western blotting, enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), tube formation assays, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibition, and RNA interference against AhR. Statistical analyses were performed with one-way ANOVA followed by multiple comparisons testing (p<0.05 considered significant). RESULTS: Fetoplacental ECs exposed to BaP demonstrated a dosedependent increase in COX-2 mRNA (p<0.001) and protein (p=0.004). In contrast, BaP had no effect on expression of COX-1 or downstream prostanoid biosynthetic genes including prostacyclin synthase or thromboxane synthase. BaP also had no effect on expression of several other key vascular genes such as endothelial nitric oxide synthase and endothelin. Thromboxane levels were undetectable by EIA, whereas BaP surprisingly led to a dose-dependent increase in 6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha (6-keto-PGF1\u03b1), the stable metabolite for prostacyclin. This effect was ablated by pre-treatment with NS-398, a COX-2 inhibitor (p<0.001).",

            "text": "Similarly, RNA interference of AhR both inhibited BaP-mediated induction of COX-2 and production of 6-keto-PGF1\u03b1 (p<0.001 for both). From a structural perspective, BaP exposure inhibited fetoplacental EC tube formation, which was rescued by AhR knock-down (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: AhR activation via PAH exposure impaired EC tube formation in fetoplacental ECs. Furthermore, it resulted in COX-2 induction and surprisingly led to increased 6-keto-PGF1\u03b1 production with undetectable thromboxane levels. This suggests that AhR activation may contribute to elevated fetoplacental vascular resistance via its inhibition of proper angiogenesis and not via production of vasoconstricting factors. Future studies are needed to further delineate the mechanisms by which fetoplacental angiogenesis is impaired. A series of studies has demonstrated high-grade serous ovarian adenocarcinoma can arise from fallopian tubes. The p53 signature in the tubal epithelium is focused as a primary change of carcinogenesis and DNA-double strand breaks (DSBs) are frequently observed in the area of the p53 signature. However, the mechanism of introducing DSBs in fallopian tubal epithelium has not been fully understood. Hydroxyl radical produced from Fenton reaction catalyzed by iron ion is a potent molecule capable of inducing DSBs. Because Transferrin, a carrier protein of iron ion, exists in follicular fluid and retrograde menstrual blood, we investigated the potential of transferrin as a DSBs introducing molecule in fallopian tubal epithelium. METHODS: Transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and 2 (TfR2) expressions in human fallopian tubal epithelium were assessed by immunohistochemistry.",

To uncover specific involvement of TfR1 and/or TfR2 in forming DSBs, small interfering RNA was employed. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry revealed both TfR1 and TfR2 were expressed in the tubal epithelium. Transferrin treatment increased the level of \u03b3H2AX in both cells. Transferrin also potentiated an extent of \u03b3H2AX expression in the presence of hydrogen peroxide served as a substrate in Fenton reaction. Those results suggest transferrin is a key molecule for forming DSBs through Fenton reaction. Knockdown of TfR1, but not TfR2, selectively reduced the uptake of transferrin and inhibited an increase of \u03b3H2AX by transferrin compared with siRNA group. TfR1 knockdown also suppressed synergistic generation of \u03b3H2AX by transferrin and hydrogen peroxide. CONCLUSIONS: Transferrin is suggested to potentiate DSBs via TfR1 in cell lines including FTSEC. Considering follicular fluid or retrograde menstrual blood contains transferrin abundantly, we propose transferrin -TfR1 axis is one of the pathway for the generation of DSBs in human fallopian tubal epithelium.",

Given the importance of Wnt signaling in placental and embryonic development, we hypothesized that extracellular inhibition of Wnt signaling by sFRP1 could to lead to FGR. METHODS: To evaluate sFRP1 gene and protein expression in human placentas, we used RT-PCR and immunoblotting. Soluble sFRP1 overexpression was achieved by tail vein injection of an adenovirus expressing a truncated form of sFRP1 to CD1 pregnant mice on E15. Fetuses were weighed on E19, and proliferation in the murine placentas was assessed by Ki67 staining. To examine the effects of sFRP1 on trophoblast function, a Matrigel invasion assay was performed. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism5 software, and a p value < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: We found that smoking mothers had elevated gene expression (13 fold increase, p<0.024) and protein (3 fold increase, p< 0.002) levels of sFRP1 in their placentas. Adenoviral overexpression of sFRP1 in pregnant mice resulted in fetal growth restriction (virus-treated animals: 1267 mg \u00b114 mg compared to controls: 1416 mg \u00b1 12 mg, p< 0.0001), decreased placental \u03b2-catenin expression, and histological evidence of increased karyorrhexis and decreased proliferation in the murine placentas. In vitro, recombinant sFRP1 inhibited Matrigel invasion by trophoblastic cells by more than fifty percent. CONCLUSIONS: Increased placental levels of sFRP1 in smoking mothers may alter trophoblast invasion and proliferation and contribute to fetal growth restriction.

RESULTS: Ageing mice had fewer pups at E17.5 (p=0.03), more resorptions (p=0.007) and more late fetal deaths (p=0.044) per litter (con n=8, AMA n=10). The pups of ageing mice had lower fetal weights (p=0.0002) and reduced crown-rump length (p=0.0051), abdominal (p=0.0136), and head circumferences (p=0.0195). Ageing mice had increased placental weight (p=0.05) and lower fetal:placental weight ratio (p=0.0002). Uni-directional maternofetal clearance of 14 C-MeAIB was reduced in older mice (\u00b5l/min/g placenta; p=0.015; n=8/group) compared to controls. UA from ageing dams showed no difference with constriction to PE, but pre-constricted arteries exhibited increased relaxation to ACh when compared to controls (p=0.0091; con n=7, AMA n=5). CONCLUSIONS: Ageing affected pregnancy outcome in C57 mice resulting in more early and late fetal losses, smaller litter sizes and growth restricted offspring, similar to findings in human studies. Reduced fetal:placental weight ratio and placental amino acid transport suggests reduced placental efficiency. Altered placental transport and increased UA relaxation provide evidence of placental dysfunction, which may affect delivery of nutrients to pups. These data support the use of the ageing mouse as a model for investigating the underpinning mechanisms linking AMA and poor outcome seen in humans. (p<0.01). T 3 alone stimulated, and IGF-1 alone suppressed, p21. NH3 powerfully inhibited the stimulation of p21 in the 135dGA, but not in 100dGA CMs. Reduced TR expression by siRNA recapitulated the actions of NH3. NH3 treatment alone did not alter TR gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: NH3 blocks T 3 's ability to suppress fetal CM proliferation, providing strong evidence that T 3 binds TRs rather than using non-genomic mechanisms. Stimulated phosphorylation of ERK/AKT by T 3 were not suppressed by NH3, suggesting the activation of a nongenomic pathway. NH3 blocked the dramatic increase in phospho-ERK/ AKT by T 3 +IGF-1 suggesting this activation pattern requires a functional T 3 -TR ligand receptor complex. Increased p21 in the presence of T 3 is not inhibited by NH3 in 100dGA CM but is powerfully inhibited the older CMs. Conclusion: T 3 signals in fetal CM via genomic and non-genomic pathways according to maturation level. , is thought to mediate maternal stress (MS) effects on the fetus because catechol do not cross the placenta. However, MS in early pregnancy induces growth restriction and is associated with pronounced later-life programming effects despite limited fetal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression at this stage of development. We hypothesized that, in addition to CORT, catechol transfer MS indirectly to the fetus by a decrease of uterine blood flow (UBF). METHODS: Pregnant sheep chronically instrumented with uterine ultrasound flow probes and maternal and fetal catheters at 0.75 gestation underwent 2h of isolation stress. We used adrenergic blockade with labetalol to examine if the decreased UBF is CATECHOL mediated. RESULTS: Ewes responded to isolation with an increase in blood pressure (BP) from 84\u00b13 to 95\u00b13mmHg for 14min and heart rate from 90\u00b14 to 121\u00b17bpm for 36min (p<0.05). UBF decreased from 346\u00b16 to 272\u00b113ml. min -1 (p<0.05) reflecting uterine vasoconstriction. Maternal CORT and noradrenaline (NA) increased for 15min from 45\u00b114 to 115\u00b19nmol.L -1 and 10.2\u00b12.0 to 27.9\u00b17.0nmol.L -1 , respectively (p<0.05). Time course and relative magnitude of fetal CORT increase were similar to the maternal CORT increase. Maximum fetal CORT concentrations were 8.1\u00b12.1% of those in the mother. Fetal NA increased from 0.6\u00b10.1 to 1.4\u00b10.4 nmol.L -1 and BP from 41.5\u00b11.6 to 48.5\u00b13.5mmHg (p<0.05). Although UBF only decreased for 36min (p<0.05), fetal NA and BP but not CORT remained elevated over 2h (p<0.05). Fetuses developed a delayed and prolonged shift towards an anaerobic metabolism in the absence of fetal P O2 and P CO2 changes. Adrenergic blockade prevented the stress-induced UBF decrease and, consequently, the fetal NA and BP increase as well as the shift towards anaerobic metabolism. Fetal CORT was transiently increased from 11\u00b12 to 19\u00b13mmol.L -1 immediately after begin of MS reflecting a labetalol rather than stress effect. CONCLUSIONS: A CATECHOL induced decrease of UBF transfers MS to the fetus indirectly which may explain programming effects of MS in early pregnancy in the absence of fetal GR expression. Fetuses respond to the decreased UBF with an endogenous CATECHOL increase and a shift towards anaerobic metabolism independently of oxygen supply. Both may contribute to the fetal growth restriction and programming effects seen after MS.",

Recipients were harvested at E18 and E19 for histologic and flow cytometric analysis of the fetus and placenta. Offspring were tracked for survival and weight. Statistical comparisons were performed using a two-tailed student t test assuming unequal variances. RESULTS: Fetal NK cells were identified in the placenta at E18, a novel finding. In vivo depletion effectively eliminated NK cells from the fetal liver and placenta at E18 ( Figure A) . Maternal decidual NK cells were minimally affected (FigB) . Fetal NK depletion resulted in a dramatic reduction in fetal survival when compared to controls (19% vs. 61%, p<0.05, Figure C ). However, fetal NK depletion did not lead to in utero growth restriction as there was no significant change in pup or placental weight at E19. Placental architecture was abnormal as highlighted by CD31 staining ( Figure D ). *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Fetal NK cells play a critical role in late-gestation fetal fitness. Abnormal placental architecture following NK cell depletion suggests that fetal NK cells may be involved in late-gestation placental remodeling or fetomaternal tolerance. Further study in this novel system will facilitate a better understanding of the role for fetal NK cells in fetal development. The insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2 (IGF1 and IGF2) are known to play an important role in placental and fetal growth. We sought to investigate whether the placental expression and DNA methylation of IGF and their binding proteins (IGFBPs) is altered in women delivering small for gestational age (SGA; birthweight <10 th percentile for gestation) and large for gestational age (LGA; birthweight >90 th percentile for gestation) neonates compared to those delivering appropriate for gestational age (AGA) neonates.",

METHODS: Uterine leiomyoma tissues, obtained from 60 premenopausal women (ages 32-47), were used for flow cytometry analysis, antibodybased cell sorting, xenografting under mouse kidney capsules for tumor formation, mRNA (real-time PCR), and protein (western blot) expression. RESULTS: Using a real-time PCR based cell surface marker array, we found significantly elevated CD34 and CD49b gene expression in a leiomyoma cell population with high expression of the stem cell transcription factors NANOG, OCT4, KLF4, and SOX2. After removing dead and hematopoietic cells, the leiomyoma cells were sorted into 3 biologically distinct populations: CD34 + /CD49b + stem/progenitor cells (+/+, ~5%), CD34 + /CD49bintermediately differentiated cells (+/-, ~7%), and CD34 -/CD49bterminally differentiated cells (-/-, ~88%). Although +/+ cells are deficient in estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) and PR, they were essential for estradiol (E)+P-dependent tumor formation in the mouse xenograft model. Interestingly, RANK (receptor activated NF\u03baB) was mainly expressed in +/+ cells, whereas its ligand, RANKL, was primarily expressed in +/-cells. In vivo, RANKL expression was dramatically elevated in leiomyoma vs adjacent myometrial tissues. E+R5020 (P agonist) increased RANKL expression by over 100-fold in leiomyoma but not in myometrial tissue explants. Additionally, RANKL treatment robustly activated both NF\u03baB and ERK signaling, increased Cyclin D1 and BCL2 expression, and significantly expanded the leiomyoma stem cell population. CONCLUSIONS: CD34 + /CD49b + cells are functional leiomyoma stem/ progenitor cells. RANKL/RANK signaling, activated in response to E+P, mediates stem cell function in a paracrine fashion. Our study may reveal potential drug targets that can be translated to novel therapeutics to prevent or shrink leiomyomas.

The mRNA and protein levels of predicted targets of miR-29c were assessed in primary leiomyoma smooth muscle cells (LSMC) following adenovirus transduction for overexpression or knockdown of miR-29c. The direct interaction of miR-29c and 3' untranslated region of predicted target genes was confirmed by luciferase activity assay. The effects of inhibitors of NF-kb, SP1 and DNA methyltransferase on miR-29c and its target genes expression were measured by QRT-PCR, western blot and siRNA strategy.",

Four common proteins related to ECM production were evaluated: fibronectin (FN1), versican, collagen 1A (COL1A), and TGF-b3. Gene transcription was assessed by normalized RT-PCR analysis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed with paraffin-embedded tissue. Western Blot was used for confirmatory testing with cryopreserved tissue. RESULTS: RT-PCR results showed up regulation of gene transcripts on average in COL1A of 1.6 fold and versican of 1.7 fold in treated vs. placebo, but with slight down regulation in FN1.

This double-blind, multi-center trial in healthy women assessed the pharmacodynamics (PD) and safety of vilaprisan. METHODS: Healthy women aged 18-45 years, sterilized by tubal ligation, were randomized equally to daily vilaprisan (0.1mg, 0.5mg, 1mg, 2mg, 5mg) or placebo tablets for 12 weeks starting at day 1 or 2 of the menstrual period. The primary study variable was the proportion of women with amenorrhea or spotting only (non-bleeding rate) in a daily diary. A dose-response curve (median point estimates) and 90% credible intervals were estimated using a Bayesian model. Secondary variables included return of bleeding during follow-up, size of follicles on transvaginal ultrasound and hormone levels. Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), laboratory parameters and vital signs. RESULTS: All randomized women received at least 1 dose of vilaprisan (0.1mg, n=12; 0.5mg, n=12; 1mg, n=13; 2mg, n=12; 5mg, n=12) or placebo (n=12) and were included in safety analyses; 69/73 women were included in PD analyses. Observed non-bleeding rates increased with vilaprisan dose: 0.1mg (0%), 0.5mg (27%), 1mg (80%), 2mg (100%), 5mg (91%); 0% in the placebo group. The Bayesian dose-response analysis estimated a non-bleeding rate >60% at doses of 1mg or higher with a probability of 95%. At 2mg the maximum rate was reached with a point estimate >90%. Return of menstrual bleeding was observed in all women \u226452 days after study drug discontinuation. Follicular growth was not suppressed during treatment, minimum average estradiol levels remained >40pg/mL. Low progesterone levels (\u00a31.57\u00b5g/L) indicating ovulation inhibition were observed in >80% of women in the 2mg and 5mg groups. No serious treatment-emergent AEs or study discontinuations due to AEs were reported. The most frequent AEs assessed as drug-related were headache, ovarian cyst (follicle \u00b330mm), fatigue and abdominal pain. Clinically relevant changes in laboratory parameters or vital signs were not evident. CONCLUSIONS: These results supported initiation of an ongoing phase 2 trial assessing vilaprisan efficacy and safety in patients with uterine fibroids. Fibroids are a common problem, affecting 70-80% of women by the age of 50. Controversy exists over the effect of therapeutic options for fibroids on ovarian reserve. However, no studies have been done to determine the effect of fibroids on ovarian reserve prior to treatment. Furthermore, an association of fibroids with reduced ovarian reserve might suggest shared risk factors. Our goal is to determine if the presence of fibroids is associated with serum AMH levels. METHODS: This is a cross sectional study of 1654 AAW initially recruited to the Study of Environment, Lifestyle and Fibroids (SELF). Inclusion criteria for participation in SELF were AA race, age 23-35 years and no known diagnosis of fibroids. Serum AMH levels were obtained using an ultra-sensitive ELISA assay. Each participant underwent a pelvic ultrasound. The true AMH was used for mean and frequency calculations and log-transformed AMH was used as the outcome in simple and multiple linear regression models. RESULTS: 364 women had fibroids identified on ultrasound. The mean age of women with fibroids was 30 \u00b1 3 years (mean \u00b1 SD) vs. 28 \u00b1 4 years in women without fibroids. The mean AMH in women with fibroids was 3.46 \u00b1 2.73 ng/ml vs. 4.14 \u00b1 3.66 ng/ml in women without fibroids.",

INTRODUCTION: Candida albicans colonization of vaginal epithelium elicits cytokines like IL-1beta that promote Th17 cells and mediate preterm labor as well as inhibits factors (CCL20) that induce regulatory T cells that are essential to sustain pregnancy. We characterized the cytokine milieu induced by lactobacilli in the presence/absence of C. albicans and showed that lactobacilli restore the balance between pro-and antiinflammatory states. METHODS: VK2/E6E7 vaginal epithelial monolayers were colonized with 10 7 cfu/mL of Lactobacillus crispatus or L. reuteri at 37\u00b0C for 24hr. C. albicans strain BWP17-WT,10 6 cfu/mL, was added for an additional 24hr. In separate experiments, epithelial monolayers were exposed to the supernatant of cultured lactobacilli followed by C. albicans colonization for 24hr. IL-1beta and CCL20 released into epithelial supernatants were measured by flow cytometry multiplex bead technology or ELISA and analyzed using ANOVA with Bonferroni correction. RESULTS: IL-1beta expression was not induced by L. crispatus or reuteri colonization of vaginal epithelium but was increased significantly by C. albicans colonization. *Figure(s) will be available online. L. reuteri supernatant inhibited IL-1beta expression in the presence of C. albicans by 50%. Both L. crispatus and L. reuteri reversed the inhibitory effect of C. albicans and significantly increased CCL20 expression. Supernatants from cultures of L. reuteri, but not L. crispatus, were as effective as live bacteria in increasing CCL20 expression. CONCLUSIONS: In vitro, lactobacilli reversed the effects of C. albicans by blunting the IL-1beta response and restoring CCL20 release.

INTRODUCTION: ABC transporters P-glycoprotein (Abcb1a/b) and breast cancer resistance protein (Abcg2) protect against potentially harmful exogenous compounds, regulating transport across the gut into maternal and fetal blood. Gut microbes have co-evolved with the host, respond to environmental cues and interact with host genetics to impact immune and metabolic status. Disruption of host-microbiota (holobiont) homeostasis can alter these interactions. Previously, we showed maternal diet to restructure the gut microbiome. We hypothesised that the dynamic nature of the holobiont would be reflected in altered relationships between gut transporters and microbiota after changes in maternal diet. METHODS: Mice (n=7/gp) were fed a control diet during pregnancy (CON) or a 30% calorie reduced diet from d5.5-18.5 of pregnancy (CR) or a 60% high fat diet from 8 weeks before, and during, pregnancy (HF). At d18.5 maternal small intestine (SI) structure (H&E), proliferation (Ki67) and gut expression of Abcb1a/b and Abcg2 mRNA were measured (p<0.05). Microbial abundance in maternal caecal contents was determined at d18.5 by G3 PhyloChip TM . Associations between the microbiome and transporters (Adonis; p<0.05, Spearman; q<0.05) were determined. RESULTS: Maternal SI crypt depth was longer in HF and trended shorter in CR. In maternal villi % of Ki67-positive cells was greater in CR. Maternal SI Abcb1a expression was >3.7-fold higher in CR, but lower in HF, an effect replicated in HF fetal gut. Abcb1a expression and % Ki67-postive cells in maternal villi were positively associated. CR decreased maternal SI Abcbg2 expression. The maternal gut microbiome was associated with ABC expression. Abundance levels of 17 families were associated with Abcb1a and Abcg2 expression in opposing directions. T. erythraeum abundance and Abcg2 expression was positively correlated in HF mothers. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a relationship between ABC transporter expression and microbial abundance levels and shows altered gut structure by maternal diet. These data have implications for drug/ nutrient transport and immune defence, which may be of concern in human pregnancies complicated by disease or malnutrition. Understanding the pathway to optimal adaptation to pregnancy and its outcomes requires a systematic approach that includes the role of the microbiome and its interactions with the host.",

Probiotic L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri RC-14 (GR-1/RC-14) reduces BV recurrence and restores the indigenous lactobacilli in non-pregnant women. We hypothesized that oral GR-1/RC-14 would modulate the vaginal microbiota and cervicovaginal cytokines in pregnant women with an abnormal Nugent score. METHODS: Pregnant women (n=86) with Nugent score\u2265 4 at 13 weeks gestation were randomized to receive orally either GR-1/RC-14 (5x10 9 CFU /strain) or placebo for 12 weeks. Vaginal swabs were collected at 13, 28 and 35 weeks gestation. Vaginal microbiota were analyzed by sequencing the V6 region of 16S rRNA, and 27 cytokines were measured with a multiplex assay. Significance was assessed with t test or Two-Way Repeated Measure ANOVA with Holm Sidak test. RESULTS: Among the 93 distinct bacterial species detected, L. iners, L. crispatus, Gardnerella (G.) vaginalis and Atopobium (A.) vaginae were the most abundant vaginal bacterial species. The Nugent score returned to normal in 30% of the women in both groups by 28 weeks. Compared to 13 weeks gestation, the relative abundance of 26 species including several Lactobacillus spp and BV-associated bacteria, G. vaginalis and A. vaginae decreased in both groups at 28 and 35 weeks. In contrast, 21 species including Finegoldia magna and Prevotella micans increased variably between groups. There was no difference in the vaginal microbiota and cervicovaginal cytokines between the two groups. However, the inflammatory cytokines IL-6, CCL3 and CCL 4 decreased and the antiinflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 increased by 28 and 35 weeks in the probiotic group but not in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Oral GR-1/RC-14 at 5x10 9 CFU /strain twice daily for 12 weeks does not change the vaginal microbiota or cervico-vaginal cytokines significantly in pregnant women with an elevated Nugent score, and these profiles are dynamic across gestation.

METHODS: Human FM explants (n=8) from normal term deliveries without labor were treated with or without viral dsRNA (Poly(I:C); 20\u00b5g/mL) for 24h. LPS (1ng/mL) was added or not and FMs incubated for another 24h. Supernatants were measured for cytokines by multiplex.",

FM explants were pretreated with media, blocking antibodies to Tyro3, These cells were subjected to normoxia and hypoxia (O2=1.5%), treatment with vehicle or VEGFA, adenoviral ARNT overexpression (or adenoviral control vector), real-time PCR, western blotting, tube formation, and wound healing assays. Student's t-test and one-way ANOVA with post-hoc testing were utilized, and p<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: In contrast to ECs from appropriately grown controls, FGRadv ECs continued to express lower ARNT levels (p<0.05). Treatment of FGRadv ECs with VEGFA resulted in more tube formation branch points (p<0.01) and total length (p<0.05). Similarly, in comparison to adenoviral control vector, ARNT overexpression in FGRadv ECs rescued VEGFA expression (p<0.01) in the setting of both normoxia and hypoxia while demonstrating trends toward improved EC migration (p=0.07) and improved tube formation branch points (p=0.05) and total length (p=0.10). CONCLUSIONS: Impaired EC-mediated angiogenesis in placentas from FGRadv pregnancies is ameliorated by direct VEGFA treatment or by rescuing of ARNT expression via adenoviral infection. Future studies to determine whether our findings persist when incorporated into a threedimensional model are needed. Early human placental and embryonic development occur in a physiologically low oxygen environment supported by histiotrophic secretions from endometrial glands. In this study we compared the placental metabolomic profile of the first, second and third trimesters to determine whether the energy demands are adequately met in the first trimester. We investigated whether HIF-1\u03b1 might regulate transcription during the first trimester. METHODS: First and second trimester tissue was collected using a chorionic villus sampling-like (CVS) technique. Part of each villus sample was frozen immediately and the remainder cultured under 2% or 21% O 2 \u00b1 1 mM H 2 O 2, and \u00b1 the p38 MAPK pathway inhibitor PD169316. Levels of HIF-1\u03b1 were assessed by Western blotting and VEGFA, PlGF and GLUT3 transcripts quantified by RT-PCR. Term samples were collected from normal elective caesarean deliveries. Metabolomic profiles of first, second trimester and term placental samples were compared. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in concentrations of ADP, NAD + , lactate, and glucose, and in the ATP/ADP ratio, across gestational age. HIF-1\u03b1 or HIF-2\u03b1 could not be detected in time-zero CVS samples (Fig. 1) . Culture under any condition (2% or 21% O 2 \u00b1 1 mM H 2 O 2 ) induced increases in HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 ( Fig. 1 ). HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 was additionally detected in stressed specimens retrieved after curettage (Fig.1) . HIF-1\u03b1 stabilisation was accompanied by significant increases in VEGFA and GLUT3 and decrease of PlGF mRNAs. These effects were suppressed by the p38 pathway inhibitor PD169316. *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that first trimester placental tissues are not energetically compromised, and that HIF-1\u03b1 is unlikely to play an appreciable role in regulating transcriptional activity under steadystate conditions in vivo. However, the pathway may be activated by stress conditions. INTRODUCTION: Uterine Natural Killer (uNK) cells are key regulators at the human maternal-fetal interface. Aberrations in uNK cell function are implicated in placental syndromes such as fetal growth restriction and preeclampsia. Functionally, uNK cells change markedly between the 1 st and 2 nd trimester of pregnancy to accommodate pregnancy-demanding adaptations. The precise mechanisms that regulate changes in uNK cell function are still poorly understood. METHODS: We isolated uNK cells (CD56 bright CD16 -CD3 -) from 1 st (7-8 w, n=6) and 2 nd trimester (13-14 w, n=6) decidual tissue by flow sorting. Conditioned uNK cell medium was used for functional analysis, including trophoblast (HTR-8/SVneo) invasion and endothelial (HMEC-1) network formation assays. Transcript profiling of uNK cells was performed by whole genome microarray (Agilent). RESULTS: 2 nd trimester uNK cells potentiated trophoblast invasion that was 2.4-fold stronger than trophoblast invasion induced by 1 st trimester uNK cells (p<0.05). In contrast, endothelial network formation (total tube length) was stimulated to a similar extent by 1 st and 2 nd trimester uNK cells. Microarray analysis identified 140 differentially expressed genes in 2 nd trimester uNK cells, of which the majority clustered into a group of interferon (IFN) stimulated genes. To investigate if this cluster is up-regulated by type I (IFN\u03b1/\u03b2) or type II (IFN\u03b3) IFNs, uNK cells were stimulated in vitro for 24h with the various IFNs. Stimulation with type I but not type II IFNs dose-dependently increased IFN marker genes (p<0.001). Functionally, type I IFNs changed uNK cells from 1 st to 2 nd trimester uNK cells. Type I IFNs enhanced 1 st trimester uNK cell mediated trophoblast invasion (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Type I IFNs mediate the functional change between 1 st and 2 nd trimester uNK cells to promote trophoblast invasion. The capacity of 1 st and 2 nd trimester uNK cells to stimulate endothelial tube formation is similar. We hypothesize that type I IFNs play a key role in determining uNK cell functions at the maternal-fetal interface to regulate processes such as spiral artery remodeling and trophoblast invasion. The prevalence of obesity (BMI \u00b330) in American women of childbearing age is still increasing. Epidemiological studies have found positive correlations between obesity and placental dysfunction. Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is necessary for placental development and fetal growth. The action of BDNF is facilitated through tropomyosin related kinase B (TRKB), a receptor kinase that induces several signaling cascades. BDNF levels are lower in plasma of obese adults however the effect of adiposity on placental BDNF is not known. We hypothesized that placentas from obese women (OB; pre-pregnancy BMI>30) will have decreased BDNF expression and attenuation of TRKB autophosphorylation when compared to placentas from lean women (LN; BMI 18.5-24.9). METHODS: Placental villous tissues were collected, in a randomized manner, following delivery by C-section at term with no labor, from LN or OB women with either male or female fetuses (n= 10 each group). BDNF mRNA expression, mature BDNF protein expression (inactive monomer and active homodimer), total TRKB protein expression, and TRKB phosphorylated at tyrosine 515 and 817 were quantified in total RNA and placental homogenates by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. Estrogen and its metabolites are important mediators of angiogenesis during pregnancy and are substantially reduced in preeclampsia. We have reported (Jobe et al Hypertension 2011) that 4-Metoxyestradiol (4-ME 2 ) induces proliferation in ovine uterine artery endothelial cells (P-UAECs). However, unlike Estradiol-17\u03b2 (E 2 ) and 4-OHE 2 , 4-ME 2 does not induce proliferation through the estrogen receptors or the adrenergic receptors. We also demonstrated (SGI 2013 ) that the signaling pathways modulating E 2 , 4-OHE 2 and 4-ME 2 induced proliferation of P-UAECs specifically converged at the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs). Furthermore, our observation that 4-ME 2 rapidly (< 15 min of stimulation) induced monophasic activation/ phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK led to the hypothesis that 4-ME 2 induced proliferation is mediated by a G-protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) or another membrane bound receptor. METHODS: P-UAECs from late pregnant ewes were pretreated with or without 10 mmol/L of G-protein Coupled Estrogen Receptor-1 antagonist (G36), Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor antagonist (CH-223191) or the EGFR Kinase inhibitor (AG 4178) followed by either 4-ME 2 or E 2 treatment (0.1 nmol/L) as these receptors are known to interact with estrogen and seem the most likely to mediate 4-ME 2 responses. In addition, we pretreated with Pertussis Toxin (PTX) (100 ng/ml) followed by either 4-ME 2 or E2 (0.1 nmol/L). Cell proliferation was evaluated using Click-iT EdU (5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine) microplate assay.",

CONCLUSIONS: Thus 4-ME 2 induced proliferation is mediated via a Gi-dependent mechanism and both E 2 and 4-ME 2 utilize similar signaling pathways regardless of their independent receptors. These novel data further support the hypothesis that the signaling pathways of estrogen and its metabolites converge regardless of their receptor. Future experiments are needed to elucidate the upstream points at which the receptors and signaling mechanism of estrogen and its metabolites are divergent.

In addition, placental AT-1R expression was also increased (p<0.01) in preeclamptic women versus healthy pregnant women. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that also in vivo active Hx sheds the AT-1R from tissues, such as monocytes and placenta. Therefore active Hx may play a role in the development of the decreased responsiveness to angiotensin II in healthy pregnancy, while the decreased Hx activity in preeclampsia may contribute to increased angiotensin II sensitivity in this disease. MBL is a component of the innate immune system active against bacterial and viral infections. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at codon 54 is associated with decreased MBL production. IFNg is produced in the female genital tract by activated T cells and by neutrophils and is a marker of immune system activation. A SNP at position +874 is associated with elevated IFNg production. We evaluated whether these genetic variations were associated with occluded fallopian tubes. METHODS: Women with laparoscopy-confirmed tubal occlusions were assayed by gene amplification and analysis for polymorphisms in the MBL (47 women) and IFNg gene (36 women). Controls were women with patent tubes (82 for MBL and 49 for IFNg). Clinical data were obtained after completion of all laboratory studies. Differences in allele and gene frequencies between groups were analyzed by Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Women with occluded tubes had a higher frequency of the variant MBL B allele (21.3 % vs. 9.1%, p = 0.0081) and the variant IFNg T allele (27.8% vs. 14.3%, p = 0.0341) than did controls. Homozygosity for carriage of the wild type AA genotypes in both the MBL and IFNg genes was identified in 67.3% of women with patent tubes as opposed to only 36.0% of those with blocked tubes (p = 0.0136). Antibody analysis to determine probable causes of blocked tubes in individual women is ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variations in the genes coding for MBL and IFNg increase susceptibility to develop fallopian tube occlusion. Lowered circulating MBL concentrations reduce anti-microbial cell-mediated immunity allowing for an increased likelihood of infection. Elevated IFNg levels signal an elevated pro-inflammatory immune response that may contribute to enhanced epithelial cell damage and scar formation in the fallopian tubes. The findings illustrate that the combined effect of two independent functional SNPs increases the likelihood of an adverse event and suggest that women with these variations may benefit from enhanced treatment of genital tract infections. Exposures detrimentally impacting ovarian reserve are not fully characterized, and this knowledge gap prevents the development of effective interventions toward prevention of premature ovarian aging.

Kshama Chandrasekhar, Julie A MacDonald, Deanna M Navaroli, Jonathan L Tilly, Dori C Woods. Department of Biology, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA. INTRODUCTION: ATP production by mitochondria in oocytes is essential for fertilization and embryogenesis. Mitochondrial activity changes throughout oocyte development, with subsets of mitochondria actively respiring while others reside in a resting state. The regulatory mechanisms that determine which and how many mitochondria in an oocyte are active or resting are unknown. To address this, we developed a novel nanoscale-sorting platform, termed fluorescence-activated mitochondrial sorting (FAMS), to identify and purify mitochondria for characterization. METHODS: cumulus-oocyte complexes were collected from 3-monthold C57Bl/6 mice after superovulation and denuded of cumulus cells. Mitochondria were isolated from oocytes using a custom-engineered BD FACSAriaIII containing a hybrid dual forward scatter mechanism powered by a photomultiplier tube and diode that distinguishes very small particles from debris and noise. Extensive validation using a 200-3000 nm calibrated bead strategy was initially performed. After purification, mitochondria were labeled with the mitochondrial membrane dye, JC-1, which remains monomeric in resting mitochondria (and fluoresces green) but aggregates in respiring mitochondria (and fluoresces red), and then segregated by FAMS into 'respiring' and 'non-respiring' mitochondrial subpopulations based on JC-1 emission spectra. RESULTS: mitochondria with high (respiring) and low (resting) membrane potentials were purified as non-overlapping entities from oocytes. Post-sort validation confirmed that active mitochondria generated ATP upon provision of ADP substrate. To our surprise, equivalent numbers of resting mitochondria were just as capable of producing ATP in the presence of ADP as their active counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Our development of a platform that enables purification of mitochondria, and mitochondrial subpopulations, from oocytes has revealed that mitochondria normally found in a resting state are fully competent to generate ATP in the presence of substrate, but are actively repressed inside oocytes by an as-yet unidentified factor(s) that specifically targets these, and not respiring, mitochondria. The identity of this factor(s), as well as how mitochondrial subpopulations change during oocyte maturation and embryogenesis, are currently under investigation.",

We hypothesised that in offspring of hypoxic pregnancy: 1) maternal treatment with the XO inhibitor allopurinol would protect against accelerated vascular ageing; and 2) this antioxidant protection would involve the maintenance of vascular telomere length. METHODS: On day 6 of pregnancy, Wistar rats (n=8 per group) underwent normoxia or hypoxia (14% O 2 ) \u00b1 allopurinol (30 mg.kg -1 .d -1 i.o. via jelly) treatment until day 20 of gestation. Pups were born naturally, culled to 8 to standardise litter size and males reared until 4 (early adulthood) or 15 (aged) months. At both ages, femoral artery endothelial function (response to acetylcholine; wire myography) and aortic telomere length (Southern blot) were determined in 1 male per litter. RESULTS: In controls, ageing impaired endothelial-dependent relaxation and increased telomere shortening (Fig. 1A) . Offspring of hypoxic pregnancy showed accelerated endothelial dysfunction already at 4 months ( Fig. 1A) . Allopurinol in hypoxic pregnancy rescued endothelial function in aged but not in young adults (Fig. 1B) . This protection by allopurinol on programmed endothelial dysfunction was matched by vascular telomere length maintenance in aged but not in young adults (Fig. 1B) . CONCLUSIONS: Maternal allopurinol protects against endothelial dysfunction in aged but not in young adult offspring of hypoxic pregnancy or in aged offspring of control pregnancy. The data show that the contribution of XO-derived oxidative stress in mediating programmed endothelial dysfunction only becomes significant when two inductors of oxidative stress synergise, namely developmental hypoxia and ageing.

We hypothesized that poor nutrition during prenatal development (70% calorie diet) accelerates cardiac aging, leading to cardiac dysfunction characterized by impaired left ventricular (LV) diastolic function, similar to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (EF) seen in elderly. Clinical measures of diastolic dysfunction include left ventricular peak filling rate (LVPFR) and the three-dimensional sphericity of the left ventricle (3DSI). METHODS: Cardiac MRI measures of EF, LV volumes, 3DSI and LVPFR in IUGR were obtained in baboons.

Linear regression and correlation were performed between 3DSI and LVPFR data for each of the three groups. RESULTS: Systolic left-ventricular (LV) function of subjects in all three groups was normal. There were significant differences between the three groups for 3DSI and LVPFR by ANOVA. ( Linear regression and correlation were performed between 3DSI and LVFR data for each of the three groups. CTR: r=0.01(p=NS); IUGR: r=0.881 (p<.02); ELD: r=0.724 (p<.05). CONCLUSIONS: All subjects had normal systolic function. 3DSI was associated with LVPFR in the IUGR and ELD groups, but not in the CTR group. These data are consistent with data showing increased fibrosis and changes in the distribution of titin isoforms in IUGR fetal baboon heart tissues (personal communication). These results support the hypothesis that developmental programming accelerates the processes leading to diastolic dysfunction, which are associated with cardiac aging. A maternal high fat diet predisposes offspring to later life obesity and impaired insulin sensitivity. Low-grade inflammatory processes are associated with high fat diet-induced obesity, however the impact of this \"meta-inflammation\" on offspring metabolic health is poorly understood. Our objective was to examine the effects of high fat diet-induced obesity on offspring growth trajectory and metabolic profiles, and whether maternal supplementation with the anti-inflammatory lipid, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), is beneficial for mothers and offspring. METHODS: Female Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to control (CD; 10% kcal from fat), control with CLA (CLA; 10% kcal from fat, 1% CLA), high fat (HF; 45% kcal from fat) or high fat with CLA (HFCLA; 45% kcal from fat, 1% CLA) diets 10 days prior to mating and throughout gestation and lactation. Subcohorts of dams/offspring were culled at gestational day 20 or postnatal day 24 (n=6/group) for plasma and tissue collection. Plasma concentrations of insulin and proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 were determined by ELISA. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated. Remaining offspring (n=10 litters/group) consumed a chow diet ad libitum from weaning until adulthood (postnatal day 150) and DXA scans and oral glucose tolerance tests were undertaken. RESULTS: CLA, HF and HFCLA dams were heavier than CD dams throughout gestation (P<0.05). Plasma concentrations of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 were elevated in HF dams, but resolved in HFCLA dams (P<0.05). Male offspring from HF dams were smaller as fetuses, but displayed accelerated growth and impaired insulin sensitivity at weaning; this was ameliorated in HFCLA offspring (P<0.05). Adult male offspring from HF dams had greater fat mass compared to all other groups (P<0.05). In response to glucose challenge, adult male HF offspring displayed hyperinsulinemia compared to all other groups (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A maternal high fat diet is associated with low-grade inflammation and programmed impaired insulin sensitivity in male offspring, evident as early as the weanling stage and persisting into adulthood. Maternal CLA supplementation normalised these effects, demonstrating that there are critical windows of developmental plasticity in which the effects of an adverse early life environment can be reversed.",

INTRODUCTION: Gestational low protein (LP) diet causes hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in adult offspring but the mechanism is not clearly understood. In this study we explored the role of insulin signaling in gastrocnemius muscles of gestational LP exposed female offspring to understand their role in LP induced hyperglycemia. METHODS: Pregnant rats were fed control (20% protein) or isocaloric LP (6%) diet from gestational day 4 until delivery. Normal diet was given to mothers after delivery and to pups after weaning until sacrifice. Glucose tolerance test (GTT) was done at 3months. Offspring were sacrificed at 4 months and muscles were treated with insulin ex vivo for 30 min. mRNA and protein levels of insulin signaling molecules were assessed at 4 months in gastrocnemius muscles.",

            "text": ": LP offspring were smaller at birth (5.3\u00b10.1 g in LP vs. 6.2\u00b10.1 g in controls) but showed rapid catchup growth by 4 weeks. GTT in LP offspring at 3 months showed elevated serum glucose levels (p<0.01; glycemia \u2206AUC 342\u00b128 in LP vs.155\u00b123 in controls, mmol/L*120min) without any change in insulin but fasting glucose and insulin levels were similar. Pancreas of LP rats showed smaller islets with less number of \u03b2-cells compared to controls suggesting the reason for the absence of increased insulin production in response to hyperglycemia. In skeletal muscles, LP rats showed reduced tyrosine phosphorylation (Tyr608 and 895) of IRS1upon insulin stimulation due to the overexpression of tyrosine phosphatase SHP2. However, serine phosphorylation of IRS1 was unaffected at Ser 318 and 612 positions but was blunted at Ser307. Further, insulin induced phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473 and Thr308), GSK3\u03b1 (Ser21) and GSK3\u03b2 (Ser9) were severely diminished in LP rats. Interestingly, LP rats displayed an increased basal phosphorylation (inactive form) of glycogen synthase (Ser641). Unlike males, insulin induced Glut4 translocation was unaffected, even though basal levels of AS160 were upregulated. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that gestational protein restriction causes impaired insulin production and a series of phosphorylation defects in skeletal muscle in a mechanism involving IRS1, Akt and GSK. Thus, LP rats have an overactive GSK3 signaling indicating insulin resistance causing altered glycogen synthase activity leading to distorted glucose homeostasis. (GC) in the perinatal period is associated with alterations in glucose tolerance in animals and in people. A common feature in the fetal programming literature is the existence of sex differences in the response to the triggering effect. The aim of the present study was to further characterize the effects of antenatal GC on glucose handling by studying the effects of antenatal steroids and opbesity in males and females. METHODS: Pregnant sheep were treated with two IM doses of betamethasone (Beta, 0.17 mg/kg) or vehicle (CTR) 24-hs apart at 80 days gestational age and allowed to deliver at term. At 9 mo of age, female sheep were randomly allocated to be fed at either 100% of recommended nutritional allowance or ad libitum for three months. Sheep were chronically instrumented under general anesthesia to place intravascular catheters. Insulin sensitivity was evaluated by iv glucose tolerance test (IVGTT). Data are presented as Mean\u00b1SEM and were analyzed by ANOVA and/or two sample t test. RESULTS: Ad lib fed sheep gain > 50% of the original weight. In the lean state we found a significant sex difference on the effects of Beta on insulin sensitivity expressed as the Insulin:Glucose ratio ( I/G). A Beta effect was significant in female (Panel A) but not in male (C) sheep. Superimposed obesity had a significant effect on the I/G in of all 4 groups (B and D). Obesity significantly impaired I/G in CTR and Beta both in females and males (P<0.05 Two way ANOVA). Antenatal BM was associated with an elevation in plasma insulin values thus an increase in I/G. *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that in our animal model prenatal exposure to a single course of GC at 0.55 gestation has long-term effects in glucose metabolism regulation in a sex dependent manner. Female Beta sheep exhibit alterations in insulin levels and the insulin to glucose ratio. Surprisingly, males were not affected. However, using superimposed obesity as a \"second hit\" we were able to unmask the metabolic alterations associated with Beta in males and to induce a worsening of the effect in females.

In both of these instances, there may be inadvertent exposure of the fetus to exogenous sex hormones circulating in the mother's body from continued or recent OC use. Yet, little is known about the health effects of OC use just before or during pregnancy on offspring. METHODS: Using multiple Danish registries, we conducted a cohort study of livebirths between 1996-2011 to investigate whether OC use up to three months before or during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of major birth defects. We collected OC use from the National Prescription Register and conservatively assumed that a woman was exposed up to the date of her most recently filled prescription. We defined never users as those who never filled an OC prescription since the study period began in 1996. Given the high prevalence of OC use, never users are likely a highly selected group of individuals and therefore may not be the best reference group. Based on the previous literature, particularly on the proposed mechanism, we then modeled OC exposure using the following categories: >3 months before pregnancy onset (reference), 0 to \u00a33 months before, and after pregnancy onset. RESULTS: Our study cohort was made up of 883,112 livebirths with 23,409 major birth defects. Compared to women with latest use of OC more than 3 months before pregnancy onset there was no increased risk of birth defects in women with use in the last 3 months before pregnancy onset (prevalence odds ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.92, 1.02) or after pregnancy onset [0.97 (0.87, 1.09). These results were consistent, even after adding pregnancies ending as stillbirths and induced abortions to the cohort [1.04 (0.88, 1.21)] and in a sensitivity analysis using propensitymatching [0.93 (0.82, 1.06)]. CONCLUSIONS: OC exposure just before or during a pregnancy is unlikely to cause a fetus to develop a major birth defect; this should reassure both patients and physicians.",

Statistical analysis included weighted frequencies to account for complex sampling design and to allow for national estimates, as well as reporting of total cost of encounter. To examine factors associated with admission to hospital, we used multivariable logistic regression to generate odds ratios and associated 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: There were 1,388,806 encounters for menstrual disorders from 2009-2011. Inclusion of primary and secondary diagnoses accounted for 81.9% of all encounters that documented menstrual disorders. The three most common diagnoses were dysfunctional uterine bleeding (38.8%), dysmenorrhea (17.8%) and excessive menstruation (12.6%). 94.9% percent of encounters resulted in treatment and release from the ED. The mean age of women presenting was 29.4 years (SE 0.02), with 38% percent of encounters from zip-codes with median household income <$39,000. The most common primary payer was Medicaid (32.9%) followed by private insurance (30%) and self pay (28.6%). The average total charges to ED services were $2,061 (SE $4.55). Menstrual disorder encounters cost a total of approximately $2.5 billion over the three years. Encounters for excessive menstrual bleeding were significantly more likely to result in admission compared to other menstrual disorders (Adjusted OR 7.1, 95% CI: 6.9-7.2). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of visits for menstrual disorders resulted in discharge from the ED and did not require inpatient admission. While the ED is often perceived as an easier and more visible access point for health care, helping women seek care in the appropriate settings could shift the burden of care and cost out of the acute setting to the ambulatory.",

INTRODUCTION: Estradiol circulates in the blood of fetal sheep as both unconjugated steroid (E) and estradiol-3-sulfate (ES). We have reported that the plasma concentrations of ES are 40-100 times higher than concentrations of E. Fetal brain regions express steroid sulfatase (STS: the enzyme that converts ES to E), leading us to propose that ES acts within the fetal brain after deconjugation and binding to the estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) . Both E and ES stimulate increases in fetal cortisol concentration. We have recently analyzed the transcriptomics response of the fetal hypothalamus to ES and concluded that the conjugated steroid does not likely act via the classical ERs.

In the second study, we chronically infused vehicle or STX64 into the lateral cerebral ventricle (0.02 mg/day) of the fetal sheep.

CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that: 1) blockade of STS does not block the cortisol response to ES; 2) the cortisol response to ES is consistent with an action at a membrane receptor in the fetal brain; and 3) the cortisol response to STX64 is consistent with increased ES availability at the receptor. We have shown that estrogen (E 2 ) suppresses growth of the fetal zone of the baboon fetal adrenal cortex, which produces C 19steroid precursors, e.g. dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHAS), that are aromatized to E 2 within the placenta. In the present study, we determined whether fetal adrenal expression of cell cycle regulators provide a mechanism by which E 2 regulates fetal adrenocortical development.",

RESULTS: Weight of the fetal adrenal glands was 35% greater (P<0.01, ANOVA) in letrozole-treated (501\u00b125 mg) than in untreated (366\u00b112) mg) animals and restored by letrozole and E 2 administration.

Therefore, there is an urgent clinical need in identifying alternative antioxidant therapy translatable to the human condition. We targeted mitochondria-derived ROS as a candidate therapy against fetal origins of cardiovascular disease during hypoxic development. We used the chick embryo as it the only species which permits isolation of the direct effects of therapy on the fetus, independent of effects on the maternal and placental physiology. METHODS: Fertile chicken eggs were incubated from day 0 under normoxia (N) or hypoxia (H; 14% O 2; term is 21 days). From days 13-18 eggs were treated daily with vehicle (water) or the mitochondrial targeted antioxidant MitoQ (0.2mg/kg/day). At day 19 embryos were euthanised by spinal transection. Cardiac and femoral vascular function was investigated using the Langendorff preparation and in vitro wire myography, respectively. A separate cohort of embryos was perfusion fixed (4% paraformaldehyde at 2.66kPa) and the cardiac morphology established by unbiased stereology. RESULTS: Chronic fetal hypoxia promoted brain sparing, impaired cardiac systolic function, endothelial dysfunction and led to dilated cardiomyopathy . Treatment of hypoxic embryos with MitoQ maintained brain sparing, while restoring endothelial and cardiac function and improving the LV lumen to wall volume ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Mitochondrial derived oxidative stress contributes to fetal cardiovascular dysfunction during hypoxic development. Targeting mitochondria-derived ROS is an attractive candidate therapy against fetal origins of cardiovascular disease in human high risk pregnancy. INTRODUCTION: Endometriosis affects 10% of reproductive aged women. Heterogeneity in pathogenesis and presentation presage poor response to conventional therapy. We found that transcription factor KLF11, implicated in uterine diseases, epigenetically regulates endometriotic fibrosis via deacetylation of Collagen1 promoter histones. KLF10, a KLF11 paralog, also recruits epigenetic mechanisms. Although frequently co-expressed, KLF10 and 11 drive divergent biological mechanisms as evidenced by inflammatory or fibrotic disease progression with surgical induction of endometriosis in Klf10 or 11-/-mouse models respectively. We investigate here the role of inflammation and immunology in endometriosis in vitro and in novel animal disease models. METHODS: Endometriosis was induced by suturing autologous 0.5 mm everted uterine segments on to the parietal peritoneum of 8 week Klf 10-/-,11-/-or wildtype mice. Lesion phenotype was assessed after 3 weeks by morphometry and mRNA expression. Immune cell infiltrate was assesed by peritoneal fluid flow-cytometry and IHC for FOXP3, interleukins 10, 17, and lineage representative CD antigens. This was supported by in vitro evaluation of Jurkat lymphocyte cells transfected with KLF10, EV, KLF10siRNA or control by PCR and western blot for FOXP3 expression.",

Lesions had abundant neutrophil and scarce lymphocytic infiltrate. KLF10 epigenetically activates transcription factor FOXP3, also implicated in endometriosis, via promoter histone methylation. FOXP3 directs development of T-regulatory cells and adaptive immunity. Loss of Klf10 regulation in the disease model results in a compensatory, exaggerated innate immune response and vesicular lesions. Congruently, KLF10 upregulated and siKLF10 repressed FOXP3 expression in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: KLF11 is associated with human diabetes, leiomyoma and endometriosis. This is the first study to describe a role for its coexpressed and closely related paralog KLF10. Strikingly, rather than an expected compensatory role, KLF10 mediates distinct inflammatory pathways that are regulated epigenetically and hence potentially reversible with pharmacotherapy. Molecular characterization of distinct disease phenotypes offers a critical new dimension for individualized treatment of endometriosis, a complicated and heterogeneous disease. In order to investigate the function of specific genes in human models of endometriosis and ovarian cancer, a model is needed that will allow in vivo modification.

Gynecology, Shanghai OB/GYN Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. INTRODUCTION: Natural killer (NK) cells play an important role in immune surveillance with the ability to neutralize target cells by recognizing major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-antigen. In endometriosis, decreased NK cell cytotoxicity has been well-recognized and is thought to be involved in its pathogenesis. The aberrant expression of both killer inhibitory receptors (KIRs) and killer activating receptors (KARs) in NK cells in women with endometriosis has been reported. However, the cause(s) for these aberrations remain unknown. Following our finding that platelets are an unindicted culprit in endometriosis development, we hypothesized that platelets may play role in NK cell dysfunction in endometriosis. METHODS: A mouse experiment using platelet and/or NK cell depletion, in vitro cytotoxicity assay of NK cells against endometrial stromal and epithelial cells, quantitative RT-PCR and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of KIR2DL1, NKp46 and NKp44 expression in NK cells, immunofluorescent staining of platelets and endometriotic stromal cells and MHC-I, measurement of TGF-b1 concentration by ELISA and the percentage of P-selectin-positive platelets in peritoneal fluid from 33 women with endometriosis and 36 controls by FACS, and in vitro cytotoxicity assay of NK cells co-cultured with peritoneal fluid taken from women with endometriosis. RESULTS: Thrombocytopenia reduced lesion size, along with immunoreactivity to TGF-b1, but this was reversed by NK cell depletion in mice with induced endometriosis. The NK cytotoxicity against endometrial cells treated with activated platelets was significantly reduced, and the expression of KIR2DL1 and NKp46, but not NKp44, was significantly altered in NK cells co-cultured with activated platelets. Endometrial cells were found to be coated with platelets, causing enhanced MHC-I expression. In peritoneal fluid, the percentage of activated platelets correlated with TGF-b1 concentration. Neutralization of TGF-b1 in NK cells co-cultured in the peritoneal fluid of women with and without endometriosis resulted in increased cytotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Activated platelets, through the release of TGF-b1 and also providing physical shield, inhibits KIRs while boosting KARs in NK cells, resulting in decreased NK cell cytotoxicity in endometriosis. Thus, our data provide a novel explanation for well-documented NK cell dysfunction in endometriosis, and suggest that anti-coagulant therapy may hold promise in treating endometriosis. INTRODUCTION: Endometriosis is defined by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus. Non-human primates are the best animal models for endometriosis research because they menstruate and can develop endometriosis spontaneously. We aimed to discover altered protein expression after induction of endometriosis in baboons, to gain insight in the pathogenesis and find potential biomarkers. METHODS: Endometriosis was induced by intrapelvic injection of menstrual endometrium in 9 female adult olive baboons at the Institute of Primate Research (Kenya). Plasma samples were collected before and after induction in the luteal and menstrual phase, and were pooled accordingly. Pools were enriched for low-abundant proteins using ProteoMiner (Bio-Rad), applied onto the Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Q Exactive MS and analyzed with Progenesis LC-MS (Nonlinear Dynamics). For identification of pepetides, Mascot was used to search against the SwissProt database (April 2014).",

CONCLUSIONS: Experimental induction of endometriosis in baboons resulted in altered protein expression levels. Some proteins were only expressed either before or after induction, especially during the menstrual phase, and can be strongly considered as potential endometriosis biomarkers. stimulates cell survival and is elevated in peritoneal fluid and serum from women with endometriosis. Inhibition of MIF activity reduces endometriotic implant survival in experimental animal models for the disease. MicroRNA-451 (miR451) is a putative regulator of MIF which is also mis-expressed in endometriosis. The objective of the current study was to examine the relationship among miR451 and MIF in eutopic and matched ectopic endometriotic tissue and to determine if miR451 regulates MIF expression and modulation of cell survival. METHODS: Endometrial biopsies and corresponding endometriotic implants were obtained from 30 women with (rAFS) stage III/IV endometriosis. Stage of menstrual cycle was taken into account but did not affect data allowing data to be collapsed across stage of menstrual cycle. miR451 and MIF transcript expression were examined by qRT-PCR while MIF protein expression was evaluated by Western blot. Cyclin E1 (CCNE1) and PTEN expression were assessed by qRT-PCR as an index of cell proliferation/survival. To demonstrate that miR451 regulates MIF expression and in turn cell survival, a human endometrial epithelial cell line transfected with miR451 (or non-targeting control) mimics was subjected to 3'UTR luciferase reporter assays as well as cell proliferation/ survival assays. RESULTS: miR451 expression was significantly increased in endometriotic implant tissue compared to corresponding eutopic endometrium (P<0.05; 14.3-fold increase) and this increase was associated with significantly (P<0.05) reduced levels of MIF mRNA and protein expression. Associated with this pattern of expression was a significant reduction (P<0.05) in CCNE1 expression and significant (P<0.05) elevation in PTEN expression in endometriotic implant tissue, consistent with a reduction in cell proliferation. 3' UTR reporter assays confirmed that miR451 targets the MIF 3'UTR and that miR451 mimics significantly reduced endometrial epithelial cell survival and this was also associated with reduced MIF protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that elevated miR451 expression in endometriotic implant tissue may be part of an endogenous mechanism to limit endometriosis survival by reducing MIF expression and function. Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent disease affecting reproductive women. Metformin could have a therapeutic effect on endometriosis through regulation of local estrogen production. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanism by which metformin regulated cytochrome p450 aromatase (CYP19A1) and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) expression in human endometriotic stromal cells (ESCs). METHODS: ESCs and endometrial stromal cells (EMs) were derived from the cyst walls of ovarian endometriomas (n=6) and normal endometrial tissues (n=6) from the same individuals. ESCs were cultured with metformin and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Real-time RT-PCR was used to quantify CYP19A1 and StAR mRNA. Pregnenolone, progesterone, and estrogen production were measured by ELISA kits. Aromatase activity was determined by using aromatase activity assay. Western blot assay was done to detect StAR, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and CREB regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2) protein expression. Coimmunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation were used to assess the effect of the CREB-CRTC transcription complex. RESULTS: 1) CYP19A1 mRNA and StARm RNA were strikingly higher (approximately 512-fold and 264-fold, n= 6, p<0.01) in ESCs, whereas they were much lower or nearly absent in Ems. 2) Metformin downregulated the CYP19A1 and StAR mRNA expression (by 32% and 31.7%, n=3, p<0.05) stimulated by PGE2 (4.5-fold and 2.4-fold, n=3, p<0.05) in ESCs. 3) PGE2 induced CRTC2 translocation and enhanced its association with CREB to form a transcription complex that binded to the cAMP response element (CRE) region of CYP19A1 and StAR promoter. 4) Through increasing AMPK phosphorylation, metformin prevented the nuclear translocation of CRTC2 and then decreased the transcription complex formation between CRTC2 and CREB. This disruption attenuated the CREB-CRTC2 complex binding to the CYP19A1 and StAR promoter. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated a detailed mechanistic analysis of CYP19A1 and StAR expression regulated by metformin in ESCs. Our data highlighted a role for CRTC2 in the mechanism by which metformin inhibited CYP19A1 and StAR expression.",

Varkha Agrawal, 1 Mukesh K Jaiswal, 2 Sahithi Parmarthy, 2 Kenneth D Beaman, 2 Emmet Hirsch. 1 1 Obstetrics and Gynecology, NorthShore University HealthSystem, Evanston, IL, USA; 2 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, North Chicago, IL, USA. INTRODUCTION: Notch signaling is evolutionarily conserved and critical for cell-fate determination, differentiation and many other biological processes. Notch signaling pathways exert effects throughout pregnancy, playing an important role in placental development and trophoblast function. Notch signaling is activated in response to tolllike receptor (TLR) ligands, which amplify the inflammatory response by enhancing NF-\u03baB signaling. To identify the role of Notch signaling in preterm labor (PTL), placental Notch receptor (Notch1), its ligand (Delta-like (Dll)1) and the Notch-induced transcriptional repressor Hey1 were assessed. METHODS: PTL was initiated on gestation day 14.5 by one of two methods: 1) inflammation-induced (IPTL): intrauterine (IU) injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a TLR4 agonist); and 2) non-inflammation (hormonally) induced (NIPTL): subcutaneous (SC) injection of the progesterone receptor antagonist mifepristone. Placentas were collected from treated and control animals 10 hrs after IU or SC injection. Singlecell suspensions of placentas from gestation day 14.5 mice were also prepared and treated with either LPS or PBS with and without gamma secretase inhibitor (GSI) (an inhibitor of Notch receptor processing) ex vivo for 10 hrs. RESULTS: Notch1, Dll1 and Hey1 were significantly elevated in placentas of IPTL mice but remained unchanged in NIPTL compared to respective controls. In placental cells cultured ex vivo, GSI significantly diminished the LPS-induced expression of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results show that in IPTL (but not NIPTL), placental Notch signaling is activated. Inhibition of Notch signaling in placental cells ex vivo suppresses the pro-inflammatory response induced by LPS. Thus, suppression of Notch signaling in IPTL might be a useful method of suppressing inflammation-induced preterm labor.",

These dramatic changes in cervical biomechanics, however, were not accompanied by increased length of the pubic ligament resulting in dysfunctional and difficult labor. Importantly, IL-8 and COX-2 gene expression were induced 7-and 5-fold (p < 0.05) in cervical stroma with combination treatment but not with RU486 or ER agonist alone. 15-PGDH was also decreased 6.5-fold with combination treatment. Interestingly, ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 mRNA levels were unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data indicate that functional progesterone receptors and local estrogen inactivation are crucial for cervical competency during pregnancy. We suggest that progressive loss of cervical PR and increased estrogen responses culminate in cervical ripening and dilation both at term and preterm. Our primary objective was to investigate changes in amniotic fluid (AF) telomere fragments as an indicator of fetal cell senescence in term labor. We also investigated the mechanistic role of short telomere oligomers (T-oligos) in inducing senescence and inflammation. METHODS: In this cross sectional nested cohort study, telomere fragment concentrations were quantitated by qPCR in amniotic fluid samples from subjects at term in labor (L) (n=50) and term not in labor (NIL) (n=51). In vitro models, using primary amnion cells and myocytes were treated with 40uM telomere mimetic sequence (T-oligo, [TTAGGG] 2 ), or control (C-oligo, [AATCCC] 2 ). p38MAPK, senescence activation phenotype, and inflammatory cytokines were examined using western blots, senescence-associated \u03b2-Galactosidase [SA-\u03b2-Gal] staining, and ELISAs for IL-6 and IL-8, respectively. COX2 expression in myocytes was determined by qPCR. Generalized linear regression and ANOVA were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Telomere fragment levels were higher in L [Median 2.3 (IQR2.1)] compared to NIL [1.7 (1.5 ]. There was a significant association between telomere fragments and L compared to NIL after adjustments (p=0.045). In amniocytes, T-oligos induced p38MAPK activation, increased SA-\u03b2-Gal positive cells, and higher IL-6 and IL-8 compared to C-oligos. This effect was minimized by coincubation with a p38 inhibitor (SB203580). p38MAPK but not SA-\u03b2-Gal was activated by T-oligos in myocytes; however, they increased cytokine and COX-2 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Telomere fragment concentrations are significantly higher in L than NIL AF. T-oligos cause p38MAPK induced amnion cell senescence. We postulate that at term, physiologic senescence of fetal amnion cells generates telomere fragments that serve as a signal to initiate parturition by enhancing inflammation or directly activating myocytes.",

(FD) during pregnancy is associated with neural tube defects and IUGR; however the underlying mechanism remains to be fully established. The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2 signaling pathways regulate cell growth, proliferation and metabolism. We recently discovered that mTOR functions as a novel folate sensor in cultured primary human trophoblast, MCF-7 and HEK293 cells (Reprod Sci 19 Suppl: 380A) We hypothesized that maternal FD inhibits placental mTOR signaling and amino acid transporter activity and causes fetal growth restriction in vivo. METHODS: ICR female mice were fed a control diet (folic acid (FA), 6 mg/kg) or a folate-deficient diet (FA 0 mg/kg) for 6 wks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy. At E18.5, dams were killed and placenta, maternal and fetal organs were collected. Trophoblast plasma membrane (TPM) vesicles were isolated from placentas. The activity of mTOR signaling was assessed by the determining phosphorylation of downstream targets for mTORC1: T389-S6K, S235/236-S6 ribosomal protein and T37/46/70-4EBP-1 and mTORC2: S473Akt and S422-SGK1) using Western blot. System A and L expression and activity were measured in TPM. RESULTS: FD mice had lower serum folate (-60 %) and packed cell volume (PCV, -12 %). However, FD did not affect maternal fasting blood glucose, food intake or weight gain in pregnancy. At E18.5, fetal weight in the FD group was decreased (-17 %, p<0.05), whereas placental weight, litter size and crown rump length were unaltered. Maternal FD inhibited placental mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling and decreased TPM System A and L amino acid transporter activities and transporter isoform expression. FD decreased the weight of maternal liver, heart, spleen and kidney and inhibited mTORC1/C2 signaling in maternal heart, liver and muscle. Furthermore, maternal FD decreased fetal PCV (20%), heart and liver weight and inhibited fetal heart mTORC1/C2 signaling. CONCLUSIONS: We report for the first time that maternal FD inhibits placental mTOR signaling and amino acid transporter expression and activity resulting in fetal growth restriction. Because we have previously shown that trophoblast mTOR inhibition is mechanistically linked to down-regulation of amino acid transport, our data provide a novel link between maternal folate availability and fetal growth.",

Importantly, accumulating triglycerides in the CGI-58 KO placenta were enriched for LCPUFAs, when compared to wild type placenta. This finding is attributed to CGI-58 deficiency, because placenta-selective overexpression of CGI-58 in the CGI-58 KO background abolished triglyceride accumulation and the selective enrichment of LCPUFAs. CONCLUSIONS: CGI-58 plays a central role in triglyceride storage and the selective trafficking of LCPUFA in the placenta. Supported by Kobe University, Japan (MM) and NIH P01HD069316 (YS). Maternal obesity during pregnancy results in an adverse intrauterine environment and affects placental function. We have shown that maternal obesity induces oxidative stress in the human placenta and decreases syncytiotrophoblast mitochondrial respiration. Sodium selenite (NaSe) binds to the active site of the selenoprotein, antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase and increases their activity. We tested the hypothesis that NaSe could improve mitochondrial respiration in isolated trophoblasts under conditions of maternal obesity and oxidative stress. METHODS: Placental tissues were collected at term (~40 weeks) via cesarean section prior to labor to avoid the confounding effects of labor on induction of placental oxidative stress s from two groups of patients based on pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI): lean -BMI 22.3+0.2 (n=5) and obese -BMI 36.0+0.3 (n=4) and with matched gestational ages. Cytotrophoblasts were isolated, plated and allowed to syncitialize. At 48 hours, cells were treated with 50nM, 100nM, 200nM, or 400nM NaSe for 24 hours with subsequent addition of 400uM H 2 O 2 for 2 hours to induce oxidative stress. Mitochondrial respiration was measured with the XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer from SeaHorse Bioscience.

However in syncytiotrophoblasts from placentas of obese mothers, basal and maximal respiration were significantly decreased (P<0.05) with H 2 O 2 alone while 50 and 100nM NaSe prior to H 2 O 2 had no effect, but 200nM NaSe prior to H 2 O 2 prevented the decrease. There were no differences in ATP coupled respiration and spare capacity in the presence of H 2 O 2 alone or with NaSe+H 2 O 2 in trophoblast from an obese pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: NaSe protects trophoblasts from oxidative stress only under conditions of maternal obesity and potentially could serve as an intervention to restore mitochondrial respiration. Antioxidants such as NaSe may improve both mitochondrial and placental dysfunction in complicated pregnancies. INTRODUCTION: Human amnion fibroblasts produce abundant prostaglandins (PG) toward the end of gestation, which is one of the major events leading to parturition. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an inducible key enzyme catalyzing PG production. Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) have been shown involved in the induction of COX-2 expression by glucocorticoids in human amnion fibroblasts. However, whether other transcriptional factors also participate in the induction of COX-2 expression by glucocorticoids is not known. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is reported to interact with GR in the regulation of a number of genes. Whether STAT3 could interact with GR to induce COX-2 expression in human amnion fibroblasts is unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of STAT3 in the induction of COX-2 expression by cortisol in human amnion fibroblasts. METHODS: Primary human amnion fibroblasts were isolated from amnion collected at c section without labor at term. The phosphorylation level of STAT3 was examined with Western blotting after treatment with cortisol in the presence or absence of protein kinase A inhibitor H89 and SQ22536. The role of STAT3 in the induction of COX-2 expression by cortisol was studied with siRNA-mediated knock-down and STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was conducted to study the binding of STAT3 to COX-2 promoter. The interaction of STAT3 and GR were examined with co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP). RESULTS: Cortisol increased the phosphorylation level of STAT3 in a time-dependent manner with the maximal phosphorylation at 6 h. The phosphorylation of STAT3 by cortisol was attenuated by protein kinase A inhibitor H89 and SQ22536. Furthermore, the induced expression of COX2 by cortisol could be blocked by either STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201 or knockdown of STAT3 expression. ChIP showed that cortisol increased the binding of STAT3 and RNA polymerase II to COX-2 gene promoter.",

INTRODUCTION: Viral infection of the placenta is associated with fetal inflammation and adverse pregnancy outcomes. There have been limited studies on how placental macrophages in the villus and adjacent fetal umbilical endothelial cells respond to a viral insult. This study aims to evaluate the communication between Hofbauer cells (HBCs) and HUVECs, and the activation of the later, during viral infection. METHODS: Human HBCs (n=4), isolated from normal term placentas, were uninfected or infected for 1 h with murine gammaherpes virus (MHV)-68 (10 5 PFU/ml), fresh media was added, and after 24 h conditioned media (CM) was collected and IL-1\u03b2 measured by ELISA. HUVECs were then exposed to HBC CM for 24 h and mRNA levels of IL-8, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E-selectin (i.e. neutrophilic response markers) were measured by qPCR (n=3-5).

Statistical significance was defined as P <0.05. Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) affects up to 30% of reproductive age women and may cause extensive financial, social and psychological disruption. Traditional methods of measuring blood loss have been replaced by assessing \"patient experience\" using patientreported outcome measures (PROM). PROMs provide insight into how patients perceive their health and the impact that treatments or lifestyle adjustments have on quality of life (QOL). This study aimed to compare bleeding-related QOL between women with/without HMB using a newly developed and validated PROM for HMB. METHODS: Premenopausal women with a subjective complaint of HMB (n=13) and a control group (n=12) with no menstrual complaints were recruited following informed consent. Those with known pelvic pathology (eg fibroids) were excluded. Participants reported bleeding experiences in the prior month using the short form of a validated PROM for HMB, the Menstrual Bleeding Questionnaire. This instrument has 22 items in 4 domains: heaviness (8 items), regularity (3 items), pain (1 item) and bleeding-related QOL (10 items). Differences were examined using Mann Whitney U tests. Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is commonly defined as >80 mL blood loss per menstrual cycle, but the diagnosis is not straightforward. The 'gold standard' technique for measuring menstrual blood loss (MBL) is the alkaline hematin (AH) method but it is not in routine clinical use. In recent years other diagnostic methods have been developed, including pictorial assessment methods (e.g. the pictorial blood loss assessment chart [PBAC] ) that can be used by patients to measure MBL. However, not all of these have been fully validated. Many studies have used modified PBACs and/or different feminine items and cut-off scores for diagnosis of HMB that have not been certified against the AH technique. We review pictorial methods for MBL assessment, with particular focus on the validation requirements.",

These searches were supplemented with material from our libraries. RESULTS: Seven validated PBACs for assessing MBL were identified. The three most commonly used were originally developed for nowobsolete feminine hygiene products. Another method used unspecified menstrual towels; two others were essentially derivative PBACs. A new menstrual pictogram (SAP-c version) has recently been validated for a widely used, contemporary ultra-thin towel that contains superabsorbent polymers. Based on our systematic search data, we present the crucial requirements for PBAC validation that will ensure their suitability for use in both clinical studies and in primary care. CONCLUSIONS: Several semi-quantitative pictorial methods exist for assessing MBL, but many are outdated because of advances in sanitary product technology; others have not been scientifically validated. In clinical practice, it is essential that verified PBACs are used correctly to diagnose women presenting with HMB; this guides decision-making for appropriate therapy and provides a standard tool for research. INTRODUCTION: Studies of ovarian torsion (OT) have shown that even in necrotic-appearing ovaries, function is preserved in 88-100% of cases if de-torsion is performed, suggesting that oophorectomy may be avoided in most cases. We hypothesized that certain clinical factors may be associated with an increased likelihood of having an oophorectomy at the time of surgery in patients with suspected OT. METHODS: Patients who presented to the Boston Medical Center ED between 1/1/09 and 7/31/14 with a diagnosis of OT who had surgery within 1 week of presentation were retrospectively identified by ICD-9 code. Patient data (age, gravidity, parity, BMI, history of prior tubal ligation and/or oophorectomy, and affected ovary size by imaging) as well as surgical data (time from presentation to surgery, work shift when surgery occurred, intra-operative findings, pathology findings, estimated blood loss, and subspecialty of surgeon) were collected. Fisher exact test, t-test, and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to identify factors that were significantly associated with having an oophorectomy at the time of surgery. RESULTS: Sixty cases were identified. 48/60 (80%) of the suspected torsion cases had OT diagnosed at surgery. Oophorectomy was not performed in any of the non-OT cases. In patients diagnosed with OT, 31/48 (64.6%) had an oophorectomy and 15/48 (31.3%) underwent ovarian cystectomy. Patient factors associated with a higher rate of oophorectomy among the OT cases were older age (p = .001), higher parity (p = .001), and larger size of the affected ovary on imaging (p = .002). Surgeon subspecialty was significantly associated with performance of oophorectomy in OT cases: gynecologic oncologists completed 10/48 (20.8%) of the cases and were more likely than generalists and other subspecialists to remove the affected ovary (p = .003). One OT patient who underwent oophorectomy had a mucinous borderline ovarian malignancy. In other OT cases where oophorectomy was performed, the pathologic findings were teratoma (29%), necrotic ovary (25.8%), cystadenoma (19.4%), follicular/simple/hemorrhagic cyst (12.9%), fibroma (6.5%), and a benign Brenner tumor (3.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Older age, higher parity, larger size of the affected ovary on imaging, and having a gynecologic oncologist perform the surgery were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of oophorectomy in OT cases. Awareness of these clinical factors may ultimately reduce unneeded oophorectomy and promote ovarianconserving surgery.",

Diogo Torres, 1 Douglas D Taylor, 1 Lynn P Parker, 2 Daniel Metzinger, 2 Cicek Gercel-Taylor. 1 1 Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Women's Health, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA; 2 Gynecologic Oncology, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA. INTRODUCTION: Early diagnosis and outcome failures are associated with current lack of non-invasive, reliable markers. Recent evidence indicates that exosomes released by tumors play roles in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer. In addition, the protein and RNA cargoes of exosomes are specific for the disease and form the basis of markers that can be utilized for management of disease. Our aim was to study the antibody response against tumor exosomes in ovarian cancer patients. METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from patient plasma by chromatography and centrifugation. Appropriate fractions (void volume) were characterized by nanoparticle track analysis (NTA) . For analysis of the presence of autoantibody, exosomes were incubated with anti-human IgG conjugated with quantum dots prior to analysis with NTA. Western blotting was performed to study exosome-associated proteins. RESULTS: Exosomes were isolated from three benign cases: a borderline tumor, a cyst adenofibroma, and a cystadenoma. The total numbers of particles were 20.41+/-6.27 X 10e8 per ml. Of these, 10.60+/-7.30% was labeled with anti-human IgG. We also studied six malignant cases that included a serous, endometrioid, primary, and recurrent ovarian malignancy. Total particles in these samples were 11.59+/-3.27 X 10e8 per ml. Further analysis of these exosomes demonstrated that 44.37+/-22.81% of them were positive for human IgG. Exosome populations studied were CD63 positive by western blotting. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that tumor exosomes carry autoantibody recognizing aberrant antigens. The presence of circulating exosomes with IgG bound appears to be a marker of malignant disease. Characterization of these antigens of exosomes may lead to markers of interest while the effectiveness of the antibody response would be of importance in designing novel therapies.",

Patients filled out a questionnaire about sexual behaviors, medical records were reviewed and a vaginal swab was collected for gram stain. BV was determined by Nugent score greater than 7. Chi square analysis was performed to test the association of BV with progesterone IUD, copper IUD, no hormonal contraception, age, race, partner circumcision, postpartum state, condom use and number of sexual partners in the past year. Multivariate binary logistic regression was performed to control for confounding factors. RESULTS: 446 patients were enrolled and we had Nugent score data for 433. The median age was 31 (18yrs-64yrs), 15.7% were Caucasian 31.6% were African American, 45.3% were Hispanic and 7.4% were other. 211 (48.7%) had a diagnosis of BV. 32 women (7.4%) used progesterone IUD(PIUD) 17 women (3.9%) used copper IUD and 231 women (53.3%) used neither IUD or hormonal contraception (NHC). On univariate analysis, partner circumcision (PC) and race were found to be statistically significantly associated with BV. PC (LR 0.51 (95%CI: 0.32-0.81) p= 0.004); African American (LR: 2.6 (95% CI:1.33-5.29) p= 0.005) Hispanic (LR 2.8 (95%CI:1.47-5.45) p = 0.002). However, IUD use was not associated with BV. After stratification by these confounders there was no statistically significant difference between BV and PIUD ( p= 0.77); CIUD(p= 0.19) or NHC (p=0.60). CONCLUSIONS: In our population, IUD use was not associated with an increased risk of BV. As the demographics of IUD use changes, older epidemiologic data may be less applicable. Future studies investigating the effects of IUD on acquisition of abnormal flora are warranted. Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a common symptom in women that is frequently difficult to treat. It is well known that CPP is associated with a reduction in quality of life (QoL). We aimed to identify whether QoL relates directly to pain intensity in women with CPP and whether other factors, modifiable or not, also impact QoL. METHODS: A detailed questionnaire was sent to all new referrals to a tertiary CPP clinic over a 27 month period. Data collected included pain scores; medical, social and abuse history; validated psychological measures; and SF-36 (a QoL measure). Only responses received prior to attending clinic were analysed. Multivariable regression models were obtained to identify significant predictors of QoL. RESULTS: 90 questionnaires were returned; 66 contained complete data sets for regression analysis. Women with CPP had reduced QoL compared to age and gender-matched population norms. The effect was greater for the physical component scores (PCS) than the mental component scores (MCS) (34 vs 43, p<0.001). Regression models demonstrated that reduced PCS scores (i.e. worse physical QoL) were predicted by an increased affective component of pain (McGill Pain Questionnaire), increased depression, reduced anxiety and a history of symptoms being disbelieved. Reduced MCS scores were predicted by increased depression and a lack of co-morbid medical conditions. Only 40% of the variance of PCS and 57% of MCS scores was predicted by these models. The strongest predictor of both subscales was depression (PCS: \u03b2=-0.613, MCS: \u03b2=-0.485). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that a number of factors contribute to QoL in women with CPP. Given that conventional treatment frequently fails to provide pain relief for these women it is reassuring to note that their QoL is not solely determined by pain intensity. Moreover, our results highlight the importance of believing patients from their first contact with medical personnel and the need for targeted psychological therapies focusing particularly on depression as a component of multidisciplinary treatment packages. The amount of variance in QoL not explained by our models suggests further work be undertaken to identify other predictors of QoL in women with CPP in order to optimize treatment strategies and design meaningful patient report outcome measures (PROs) for future clinical trials. Chronic Pelvic Pain (CPP) is common, but its management is difficult and little is known about the underlying pain mechanisms. Gabapentin is increasingly being prescribed for CPP despite no supporting evidence and no understanding of how it produces analgesia. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) of the brain is a sensitive tool that has been successfully used to understand central mechanisms in other chronic pain conditions and assess efficacy in early stage drug trials. METHODS: An fMRI study of the central effects of gabapentin in women with CPP was nested within a pilot RCT (GaPP). Primarily we aimed to assess whether gabapentin alters brain activity in women with CPP. 11 women (placebo n=5; gabapentin n=6) underwent a 3T fMRI brain scan after \u00b312 weeks treatment. Brain activity at rest, and in response to noxious thermal (arm/abdomen) and punctate (abdomen) stimulation were recorded. Data were analysed with FSL and SPM8. Analyses assessed resting state networks (RSNs:known to be altered in chronic pain and by centrally acting drugs) and stimulus-related activity in the insula (thought to encode pain intensity) and the PAG (frequently upregulated in chronic pain and potentially modulated by gabapentin).",

CONCLUSIONS: Despite the small sample size, our results support an effect of gabapentin on brain activity in women with CPP. Furthermore, they suggest a central component to CPP that can be suppressed with gabapentin. The observed disruption of RSNs is similar to that seen in fibromyalgia where it is predictive of a response to pregabalin. We believe these results justify both a definitive clinical trial and a larger mechanistic fMRI study to investigate the role of gabapentin in CPP further. Benign gynecological diseases are characterized by growth dependence on sex steroids in case of fibroids or a modulation of the normal hormonal activity observed by relative progesterone resistance in endometriosis. Selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs) may have beneficial effects in these disorders as already reflected by clinical data. Objective of the outlined studies was to compare the progesterone receptor (PR) antagonistic activity of different SPRMs, including testing of the novel SPRM, vilaprisan, in an endometriosis model. METHODS: Different SPRMs have been analyzed on their PR activity in the endometrial transformation assay in rabbits and implantation efficacy test in rats. Ulipristal and vilaprisan have also been evaluated in an estrogen and progesterone stimulated myometrial growth assay in mice (as surrogate marker for fibroid growth). A disease model for hormonedependent endometriosis in the rat has been performed and lesion size analyzed after vilaprisan treatment. RESULTS: Oral administration of different SPRMs to rats showed full inhibition of implantation starting from 0.3 mg/kg*d (lonaprisan/ ZK230211) up to 10 mg/kg*d (ulipristal) . Antagonistic effects on endometrial transformation could be observed at doses from 1 mg/kg*d (lonaprisan, vilaprisan) up to 10 mg/kg*d (mifepristone, ulipristal) .",

INTRODUCTION: Studies in women have suggested higher risk of HIV acquisition in women using progestin-containing contraceptives, including the levonorgestrel intra-uterine system (LNG, Mirena TM ), medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA, Depo Provera TM ), and northindrone acetate (NEA, oral tablet). Mechanisms to account for these observations are unclear, but may involve progestin-mediated cellular pathways in the upper female reproductive tract (FRT) . The objectives of the current study were to determine the effects of trans-activating doses of the progestins LNG, MPA, and NEA on expression of pro-inflammatory factors by endometrial stromal fibroblasts (eSF) in vitro. METHODS: Endometrial biopsies were obtained from premenopausal women undergoing benign gynecological procedures and oocyte retrieval. Samples were digested and eSF were isolated using size fractionation and selective attachment. eSF were passaged twice and plated into 10 treatment groups/sample: 1\u00b5M progesterone (P 4 ); 10nM estradiol (E 2 ), E 2 +P 4 (E 2 P 4 ), 54.7nM LNG; 6nM MPA; 0.294\u00b5M NEA; E 2 +LNG (E 2 LNG); E 2 +MPA (E 2 MPA); E 2 +NEA (E 2 NEA); and ethanol vehicle (veh). Cells were treated for 14d (with 48 hr medium exchanges), after which RNA and conditioned media collected for transcript and protein analysis. RESULTS: E 2 P 4 , E 2 LNG, E 2 MPA, and E 2 NEA all stimulated mRNA and protein production of IGFBP1, a marker of eSF decidualization. P 4 , LNG, MPA, and NEA (without E 2 ) resulted in reduced IGFBP1 mRNA expression and protein production (p<0.05) compared with each compound + E 2 . Up-regulation of PR expression confirmed the bioactivity of E 2 treatment compared to veh (p<0.05). MPA increased (p<0.05) IL6 protein secretion compared to other progestins and E2P4. Combined treatment with E 2 attenuated this effect, resulting in comparable levels to E 2 P 4 . Similar patterns were observed for VEGFA. All progestins, with or without E 2 , increased (p<0.05) CCL2 protein compared to E 2 P 4 . CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that there are specific effects of each progestin on the production of factors associated with inflammation, immune cell recruitment, and immune cell activation. These effects may contribute to mechanisms of immune modulation in the upper FRT, creating a niche conducive to HIV infection. JCC and SH equal contribution. Supported by NIH AI083050 (WCG/LCG) and F32HD074423 (JCC). INTRODUCTION: Unscheduled breakthrough-bleeding ('spotting') is a common problem in progestin only contraceptive (POC) users. A major feature of POC-endometria is the presence of 'fragile' luminal epithelium (LE), susceptible to shedding/bleeding. We propose that disturbances in Wnt signalling, mediated by signals from the decidualized stroma in POC-endometria, causing LE alterations, underlying fragility and bleeding events. METHODS: Wnt5a and 7a, \u03b2-catenin, E-cadherin and DKK1 examined by immunohistochemistry in POC-and normal endometrium. Primary human endometrial stromal cells (HESC) treated with estrogen (10 -8 M) and progesterone (MPA, 10 -7 M), prolactin (PRL) and DKK1 were assessed by ELISA in decidualized (DEC, day 12) versus non-DEC (day 2) media. Phospho(P)-GSK3 \u03b2, Crumbs and Wnt7a localization was examined by immunocytochemistry in recombinant human (rh)-DKK1 treated endometrial epithelial cells (EEC). P-GSK3\u03b2 abundance was also determined by western immunoblot (WB). The impact of DECversus non-DEC media and rhDKK1 on real-time EEC proliferation and migration was determined using the xCelligence system. The impact of a decidualizing stroma on epithelial tight junctions was determined by taking transepithelial resistance measurements RESULTS: Wnt-5a, Wnt7a, \u03b2-catenin and E-cadherin localized to luminal/glandular epithelial cells in cycling endometrium. DKK1 localized to luminal epithelium in proliferative-phase, and stroma in secretory-phase endometria. In the POC-endometrium, Wnt7a, \u03b2-catenin and E-cadherin had disappeared/displayed abnormal localization while DKK-1 strongly localized to DEC-stroma. DEC-HESC secreted elevated levels of PRL and DKK1 versus non-DEC. Treatment of endometrial epithelial cells (EEC) with DEC-media or rhDKK1 reduced EEC proliferation and increased migration. rhDKK1 treatment of EEC resulted in a down-regulation of Wnt7a, crumbs and P-GSK3\u03b2 WB also demonstrated a reduction in P-GSK3\u03b2-catenin upon rhDKK1 treatment. Co-culture of epithelial cells with decidualizing stromal cell decreased tight junction integrity. CONCLUSIONS: Wnt signalling molecules are altered in the POCendometrium and rhDKK1 treated EEC. Alterations in Wnt signalling pathways impact cell function. This data suggests that stromal signals (DKK1) impact on signalling and function in the epithelium, contributing to epithelial fragility in POC-endometria. The efficacy of long-acting reversible methods of contraception (LARC), especially intrauterine devices/system (IUD/IUS) in reducing unplanned pregnancy is widely recognized. In cohort studies post-abortal contraception by means of IUD/IUS has been associated with greatly reduced risk (approx. 70%) of repeat abortion. In the present randomized trial we study the long-term effect(s) of routine provision of either the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system or copper-releasing intrauterine device in comparison to initiation of oral contraceptives at the time of abortion (either medical or surgical). METHODS: Adult women requesting termination of an unwanted pregnancy of up to 12+0 weeks of gestation between October 2010 and February 2013 (n=2305) were informed about the study. Half of them (49%) were interested in intrauterine contraception and 756 (66%) were enrolled. They were randomized into two groups. In the intervention group (n=377) women received an IUD/IUS at the time of surgical abortion or at follow-up visit 2-3 weeks after medical abortion. In the control group (n=376) oral contraceptives were started with a follow-up in the primary health care. Repeat abortions were monitored by means of the abortion registry of the Finnish National Institute of Health and Welfare. The follow-up was continued until first repeat abortion or the end of follow-up (end of 2013). The median follow-up time was 28 months. RESULTS: There were fewer subsequent abortions in the intervention group when analyzed by either intention-to-treat (ITT) or per-protocol (PP) basis. The existence of a close and complex relationship between chronic pelvic pain and endometriosis is widely recognized. Peritoneal lesions of endometriosis are characterized by an increased density of nerve fibers, compared to normal peritoneum. These nerve fibers are proposed to play a role in generation and transmission of pelvic pain in endometriosis; however, neurogenesis and pain generation mechanisms of the disease remain unclear. Therefore, this study aims to quantify the expression of neuronal guidance and nerve growth molecules in peritoneal endometriotic lesions.",

To calculate the recurrence rate, follow-up started the day after first surgery and ended at the time of new surgery or death or in March 2011. The recurrence rate was calculated using the person-time contribution among the subset of all women with a first surgery. RESULTS: Among the subset of 902 women with incident endometriosis in THIN who were also recorded in HES, we ascertained first hospitalizations for surgery for endometriosis by manual review of hospital records and retained 436 women. In total, 100 women had potential recurrence (new recorded entry of surgery). After manual review, 86 (20%) were considered to have had a second surgical procedure for endometriosis -i.e., recurrence. Of these, 51 women (59%) had \u2265 2 surgical procedures. Most (71%) underwent recurrent surgery within 3 years of the initial procedure. The most common type of surgery was hysterectomy (44%). The recurrence rate was highest in women aged 12-20 years at the time of first surgery (7.6 per 100 women-years). CONCLUSIONS: Data on endometriosis recurrence are scarce. In this study, the first systematic analysis using a primary care database, one in five women undergoing surgery for endometriosis underwent surgery for disease recurrence, with most of these procedures taking place within 3 years of initial surgery. Women aged 12-54 years between January 2000 and December 2010 who had an incident diagnosis of endometriosis, had been enrolled with their PCP for \u22655 years and had a computerized prescription history of \u00b33 years were identified by automatic review of Read codes.

After transfection of let-7f mimics for 48 hours, aromatase expression was decreased in both Ishikawa cells and HESCs using qRT-PCR and western blot. Let-7f transfection also led to a significant decrease in number of migrating cells in both HESCs and Ishikawa cells (7.5 vs 4.3, P=0.032, and 13.7 vs 6.1, P=0.009, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Aromatase inhibitor treatment significantly increased expression of let-7f in Ishikawa cells and HESCs from patient with endometriosis. Enhanced lef-7f expression effectively decreased endogenous aromatase expression and reduced the migration of endometrial cells. One mechanism of action of aromatase inhibitors is through altered lef-7f expression. Direct modulation of miRNAs involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis may have therapeutic potential. Endometriosis is defined as the growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. It is well-known that ectopic endometrium is characterized by estrogen dependence and progesterone resistance. Epigenetic mechanisms may play an important role in the etiology of endometriosis. The modification of histones by methylation of lysine residues has been shown to regulate gene expression by changing chromatin structure. We have previously shown that endometriotic lesions had higher levels of histone acetylation and methylation than control tissues. We aimed to determine the levels of histone marks such as H3K27me3, a well-known repressive mark, in endometriosis by Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of an endometriosis-focused Tissue Microarray (TMA). We also determined the expression profile of ER and PR receptors and correlate them to histone mark expression.",

In addition, we were able to document differences in cell specificity (i.e., glands vs. stroma) and confirmed the nuclear localization of these markers. We observed that lesions (ovarian, fallopian, and peritoneal) are characterized by higher % of H3K27me3 positive nuclei compared to eutopic endometrium from patients.

The majority of intrabursal AdCre-infected LSL-K-ras G12D/+ Pten fl/fl Axl +/+ mice had primary (78%) and metastatic tumor formation (86%) whereas the majority of LSL-K-ras G12D/+ Pten fl/fl Axl -/had primary tumor formation (64%) but few had metastatic tumors (28%) (p<0.05). There was no difference in primary tumor weight between the two groups: 120mg for Axl +/+ vs. 110mg for Axl -/-. Metastatic tumors were microscopic and therefore unable to be resected and weighed prior to identification by H&E staining. Western blotting of primary and metastatic tumors from LSL-Kras G12D/+ Pten fl/fl Axl +/+ showed high AXL expression compared to no AXL expression in the ovaries of normal mice. CONCLUSIONS: AXL expression in advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer correlated with lower overall survival. Primary ovarian and metastatic tumors in this intrabursal AdCre-infected LSL-K-ras G12D/+ Pten fl/fl mouse model express AXL. Deletion of the receptor tyrosine kinase, AXL, in this conditional genetically engineered mouse model of endometrioid ovarian cancer resulted in inhibition of metastatic tumor formation. AXL is a critical factor driving metastasis in this genetically-engineered murine model of metastatic ovarian cancer. Targeting cell motility, which is required for dissemination and metastasis, has a therapeutic potential for treating ovarian cancer, and molecular regulation of cell motility needs to be uncovered for developing novel therapeutics. Ceramide, one of sphingolipids, has been emerging as a bioactive lipid, and we discovered novel role for ceramide in cell motility. In the present studies, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which ceramide suppresses cell motility and potential of ceramide-based therapy for ovarian cancer. METHODS: Invasive ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells spontaneously form protrusions, such as lamellipodia, required for generating locomotive force in cell motility. Cell motility was determined by lamellipodia formation. Ceramide interacting proteins were determined by pull down assay using ceramide analogue probes. An ovarian cancer SKOV3 cell xenograft mouse model was established for testing therapeutic efficacy of ceramide liposomes. RESULTS: Small interfering RNA screening identified class II phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase C2\u00df (PI3KC2\u00df) as the predominant isoform of PI3K involved in lamellipodia formation. Treatment with cell permeable C 6 -ceramide significantly decreased the number of cells with PI3KC2\u00df-driven lamellipodia, the levels of PI3KC2\u00df products, and Akt phosphorylation. Interestingly, ceramide was revealed to interact with PI3KC2\u00df and affect its compartmentalization, thereby suppressing cell motility. To determine the potential of ceramide as a therapeutic agent, the effects of C 6 -ceramide liposomes on cell motility and in vivo ovarian cancer metastasis were tested. Ceramide liposomes exhibited not only an inhibitory effect on cell motility, but also therapeutic efficacy against peritoneal dissemination and metastasis in an ovarian cancer cell xenograft mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our studies identified ceramide as an inhibitory lipid for PI3KC2\u00df-controlled cell motility, and they raise therapeutic potentials of ceramide for treating ovarian cancer dissemination and metastasis. Hypoxia is the key regulator of cancer progression, inducing epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) which is an initiating process of ovarian cancer metastasis. The exosome bioactivity (i.e. release and content) is regulated by oxygen tension; however, the effect of exosomes on EMT has not been established. The aims of this study were to establish the effect of ovarian cancer cell-derived exosomes released under hypoxic condition on EMT of target cells; and to determine their exosomal content (protein and miRNA). METHODS: Exosomes were isolated and purified by differential and buoyant density centrifugation from SKOV-3 cell conditioned media cultured under oxygen tensions of 0.1% (exo-SKOV3-0.1%) and 8% (exo-SKOV3-8%) for 48 h (BioSpherix). Exosomes were characterised by their density, presence of exosome specific markers (CD63 and TSG101) using Western Blot, size distribution (Nanosight\u2122) and shape with electron microscopy. BeWo cells were used to establish the effect of exo-SKOV-3 on EMT. EMT was validated by the ratio of E-cadherin (epithelial marker) to N-cadherin (mesenchymal marker). The effects of exo-SKOV-3 on target cell migration were determined using a live-cell imaging system (Incucyte). The exosomal protein and miRNA profiles were established by mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and RT-PCR, respectively. RESULTS: Exosomes were identified as spherical vesicles with a typical cup-shape, diameters ranging from 50 to 100 nm with the expression of endocytic markers. Hypoxia (i.e. 0.1% O 2 ) increased the exosome release from SKOV-3 cells by ~3-folds and induced a mesenchymal phenotype (increased N-cadherin/E-cadherin ratio) of BeWo cells compared to exosomes released under 8% O 2 . BeWo cells displayed an epithelial phenotype; however, exo-SKOV-3 induced the expression of mesenchymal marker and cell migration. Finally, we identified hypoxicspecific exosomal proteins and miRNA profile in exosome isolated from SKOV-3 exposed to 0. ",

            "text": "In this study, we showed that the combination of EGCG and curcumin significantly reduced SKN cell proliferation more than either drug alone. The combination induced apoptosis at a much lower curcumin concentration than previously reported. EGCG enhanced the incorporation of curcumin. Curcumin induced autophagy while EGCG decreased autophagy. Curcumin increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activity while EGCG decreased ERK1/2 activity in SKN cells. CONCLUSIONS: These experimental findings suggest that combination treatment reduces uterine LMS cells viability and induces apoptosis in uterine LMS cells by increasing the cellular incorporation of curcumin in the presence of EGCG. Moreover, EGCG may play an important role in the cross-regulation between autophagy and apoptosis of cucumin in SKN cells. In our previous study, we reported that cytokeratin (CK19) and annexin A8 (ANXA8) mRNAs are optimal markers for onestep nucleic acid amplification (OSNA). In this study, we further explored which of these two targets provided superior detection of sentinel lymph node metastases in cervical cancer. METHODS: CK19 and ANXA8 mRNAs were evaluated with OSNA assays using 22 histopathologically positive (squamous cell carcinoma: 11, adenocarcinoma: 11) and 217 histopathologically negative lymph nodes (LNs). The cutoff values for CK19 and ANXA8 mRNAs were established by the sensitivity and specificity of serial cutoff values (25-5000 copies/ \u00b5L) in receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC). By comparison of the accuracy to histopathological examinations, the optimal marker was determined. RESULTS: To establish a cutoff value for the OSNA assay using histopathologically positive and negative LNs, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of serial cutoff values (25-5000 copies/\u00b5L) in ROC curves.",

Based on this analysis, we set the cutoff value for CK19 mRNA in the OSNA assay to 250 copies/\u00b5L. For ANXA8 mRNA, cutoff values of both 75 and 100 copies/\u00b5L showed superior sensitivities and specificities compared with the other tested cutoff values. When considering histological procedures as the gold standard, no significant differences in sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, or concordance rates were observed between cutoff values of 75 and 100 copies/\u00b5L. Therefore, the cutoff value for ANXA8 mRNA was 75-100 copies/\u00b5L. To determine which of these was the optimal marker, we compared the accuracy of CK19 mRNA versus ANXA8 mRNA; CK19 mRNA showed significantly improved specificity, positive predictive value, and concordance rate.

This study aimed to assess the prognostic significance of tumour/stroma ratio (TSR) in endometrial adenocarcinomas and to investigate its relationship with other clinico-pathological parameters. METHODS: TSR was measured in a series of 400 endometrial adenocarcinoma cases using systematic spot-counting software on digitised hysterectomy specimens. TSR prognostic significance (overall survival; OS) and disease free survival (DFS) were determined using Cox Proportional Hazards regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier curves generated. Associations of TSR with other clinico-pathological parameters were determined using non parametric tests and corrected for multiple comparisons using the Holm-Bonferroni method. RESULTS: TSR as a continuous variable related to worse OS (P = 0.034) in univariable Cox regression analysis. Using an optimal cut-off TSR value of 1.3, TSR-high (stroma-poor) tumours were associated with significantly worse OS (HR 2.507; 95%CI 1.22-5.14; P = 0.012) and DFS (HR 2.18; 95%CI 1.15-4.160;P = 0.017) in univariable analysis.

Determining whether pregnancy complications involve activation of graft rejection has important clinical implications for the treatment of preterm labor. Adiponectin is a hormone specifically expressed in adipose tissue; levels decrease as obesity increases, and low levels of adiponectin are associated with background inflammation and propensity to develop metabolic syndrome. We hypothesize that elevated inflammatory biomarkers and low levels of adiponectin may be associated with unexplained RPL. METHODS: Women with RPL (cases; n=136) were compared to healthy, parous controls (n=137). RPL was defined as two or more pregnancy losses and no more than one prior live birth. Women with positive antiphospholipid antibodies, uterine malformation, or parental balanced translocation were excluded. Controls were defined as at least one live birth and no more than one prior pregnancy loss. Clinical and obstetric history and BMI were obtained. Inflammatory markers including ferritin, IL-6, and adiponectin were assessed and levels were analyzed using linear regression including case status and relevant clinical data in a regression model. Uterine vascular adaptations, including angiogenesis, are essential during early pregnancy. Impaired adaptations contribute to increased risk of pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. Circulating levels of relaxin peak in early pregnancy in humans and are thought to contribute to uterine angiogenesis. This study investigated the role of relaxin in uterine vascular adaptations during early pregnancy using relaxin deficient mice. METHODS: Uterine tissues were analyzed before implantation (days 1-4) in wild type (Rln +/+ ) and relaxin-deficient mice (Rln -/-). Genes included angiogenic factors (VegfA, and its receptor Vegfr2; hypoxiainducible factor-1\u03b1, Hif-1\u03b1; egl nine homolog-1, Egln1), genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling (matrix metalloproteinase-14, Mmp14; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3, Timp3), and receptors for relaxin (Rxfp1) and estrogen (Esr1, Esr2). Immunohistochemistry with antibodies to BrDU (labels proliferating cells) and the endothelial cell marker CD31 was used to visualize the proportion of vessels containing proliferating endothelial cells. Circulating progesterone concentrations were measured by mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Expression of Egln1, Esr1, Hif-1\u03b1, Mmp14, Rxfp1, VegfA and Vegfr2 mRNA were significantly increased on day 1 of pregnancy in Rln -/compared to Rln +/+ mice. By day 4 of pregnancy, differences in mRNA expression were no longer detectable between the genotypes for most genes. Proliferating endometrial endothelial cells were observed on day 4, but not day 1, of pregnancy; there was no significant difference in the percentage of vessel profiles containing proliferating endothelial cells between Rln +/+ and Rln -/mice. Plasma progesterone concentrations were significantly elevated at day 4 of pregnancy in Rln -/mice compared to Rln +/+ mice (p=0.0134). CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate that relaxin-deficiency impacts on uterine gene expression in early pregnant mice, but does not cause abnormal endometrial endothelial cell proliferation prior to implantation. The functional consequences of the increased mRNA expression and circulating progesterone levels in Rln -/mice are unknown, but may reflect compensating mechanisms that prevent disruptions to uterine angiogenesis in early pregnancy. A better understanding of processes related to blastocyst formation could lead to novel identifiers of viable embryo development and eventually influence assisted reproductive techniques. We compared messenger RNA levels in cleavage and blastocyst stage embryos to identify differential gene expression during blastocyst development of human embryos. METHODS: Embryos frozen at the pronuclear stage and donated for research were used for this study under approval of our institutional review board. Three good-quality, non-fragmented day 3 cleavage-stage embryos and 3 good-quality day 5 blastocyst-stage embryos were studied individually. RNA was extracted, and after linear amplification, genes were detected using Affymetrix Human U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. We compared messenger RNA levels between these day 3 and day 5 embryos (n = 3 for each group), with statistical significance assigned using a standard t-test and p-values <0.001. The data were validated with independent embryonic gene datasets available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes was used to perform pathway analyses for validated genes (p <0.01 considered statistically significant). RESULTS: Fifty genes were found to be differentially expressed between day 3 and day 5 embryos, with fold changes ranging from -5.75 to +18.04. Of 47 genes available for validation in the GEO Datasets, 23 had significant differential expression, with 21 in the same direction as our discovery set (kappa 0.8). Pathway analysis revealed that day 3 and day 5 differentially expressed genes largely represented amoebiasis and cancer pathways (FDR < 0.1). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that expression of genes involved in embryonic migration, adhesion, and invasion are important in the development of human preimplantation embryos and are critical for the processes necessary to facilitate implantation. Future validation studies and functional analyses will assist in uncovering gene markers that could be used to identify viable blastocyst-stage embryos for in vitro fertilization. Several studies report differences in oocyte and embryo quality in obese women, and alterations in the follicular environment due to obesity may lead to suboptimal oocyte development. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression, have been identified in human follicular fluid but they have not been described in the context of obesity. To determine whether obesity alters miRNA expression patterns in follicular fluid, we examined miRNA expression in follicular fluid from lean and obese women. METHODS: Lean (BMI<25; n=4) and obese (BMI>30; n=4) women undergoing in vitro fertilization for male-factor infertility were selected for study with approval of the institutional review board. Total RNA was purified from the follicular fluid and 100 ng samples from each patient were reverse transcribed and preamplified prior to assessment of expression on A-set miRNA TaqMan Low Density Arrays (Life Technologies). miRNA expression was normalized against the mammalian U6 endogenous control and differential expression determined via the conventional \u2206\u2206Ct method. Statistical significance was assigned using a standard t-test with unequal variances, and significance was set at p < 0.05. Validated miRNA targets (through reporter assay, Western blot, or qPCR) for differentially expressed miRNAs were taken from miRTarBase and TarBase. RESULTS: We detected expression of 138 miRNAs in human follicular fluid, of which 24 miRNAs (17%) had statistically significant differential expression. Among these, 23 were significantly downregulated in the obese group. These differentially expressed miRNAs had over 150 validated targets, many relating to relevant functions such as oocyte metabolism, DNA methyltransferase activity, COX2 expression, metalloprotease expression, and granulosa cell apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Differential expression in miRNAs occurs in follicular fluid of lean and obese women, indicating an altered follicular environment in obesity. Moreover, there appears to be a nearly universal decrease in miRNA expression in obese women, which may negatively affect the ability of the follicular environment to optimize oocyte development at a post-transcriptional level. Future studies of follicular fluid from obese infertile and fertile women may further refine the identities of miRNAs and targets associated with obesity and infertility. (Hirota, et al., J Clin Invest, 2010) . p53 deficiency is also associated with decidual senescence and provokes growth restriction and terminal differentiation of dedidual cells with increased levels of p21, and senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase activity (SA-\u03b2-gal). These results suggested that premature decidual senescence is a cause for the pathogenesis of preterm labor/birth. Our aim was to determine whether the chorioamniotic membranes (including the decidua parietalis) from women who had undergone preterm or term labor show upregulation of senescence-associated genes and increased SA-\u03b2-gal staining. METHODS: Chorioamniotic membranes were collected from different groups of women: 1) who underwent term spontaneous labor (TSL), 2) who delivered term without labor (TNL), 3) who underwent preterm spontaneous labor (PTL), and 4) who delivered preterm without labor (PTNL) (n=7-9 each). Total RNA was extracted and mRNA expression of 84 senescence-associated genes was quantified by qRT-PCR. Staining of SA-\u03b2-gal was performed in the chorioamniotic membranes, and its intensity was semi-quantified using a slide scanner. RESULTS: 1) Senescence-associated genes were differentially expressed among groups; 2) seven senescence-associated genes (IRF5, PCNA, IFNG, TWIST1, AKT1, IGF1, and CCND1) were downregulated, and GADD45A was upregulated in the TIL group when compared to the TNL group; 3) twenty-eight senescence-associated genes (E2F3 , IRF5,  CDKN1A, MAP2K1, MAP2K6, CHEK2, MDM2, GSK3B, IFNG, CCNE1,  IRF3, TP53BP1, IRF7, MORC3, TP53,PTEN, TERF2, RBL1, CALR, RB1,  AKT1, PIK3CA, RBL2, IGF1R, SIRT1 , ATM, MAPK14, and CDK2) were downregulated, and SERPINB2 was upregulated in the PTL group when compared to the PTNL group; 4) nine senescence-associated genes (IFNG, CCNE1, COL1A1, CCNA2, COL3A1, CCNB1, FN1, GADD45A, and CCND1) were upregulated in the PTL group when compared to the TIL group; and 5) staining of SA-\u03b2-gal was observed only in the choriodecidua, and it was higher in the PTL than in the TIL group. CONCLUSIONS: Upregulation of several senescence-associated genes and SA-\u03b2-gal activity in the chorioamniotic membrane is associated with preterm labor when compared to term labor. However, a drastic downregulation of senescence-associated genes is observed in chorioamniotic membranes from women at term and in preterm labor when compared to women without labor. Our preliminary data using a murine model demonstrate that advanced maternal age causes dystocia and increases the duration of active labor, rate of stillbirth, and rate of neonatal mortality (Sanchez-Rodriguez et al, unpublished data). The immunological mechanisms whereby older mothers undergo adverse pregnancy outcomes are unknown. The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of advanced maternal age on the T-cell repertoire in the mother and offspring. METHODS: Older (20-24 weeks old, n=10) and young (8 weeks old, n=10) pregnant B6 mice were euthanized prior to delivery. Spleen and thymus were collected from mothers and fetuses. Decidual tissues were also harvested from mothers. Additionally, neonates (1-week old) from older and young mothers (n=19 each) were euthanized and splenocytes were harvested for immunophenotyping. The T-cell repertoire: Th1 (CD4+IFN\u03b3+), Th2 (CD4+IL4+), Th9 (CD4+IL9+), and Th17 (CD4+IL9+) cells, CTLs (cytotoxic T cells, CD8+IFN\u03b3+), Tc17 cells (CD8+IL17+) and Tregs (regulatory T cells, CD4+Foxp3+) were determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: 1) Prior to delivery, decidual tissues from older mothers contained lower proportions of Th1 and Th9 cells, when compared to young mothers (p=0.05 and p=0.003); 2) decidual tissues from older mothers contained lower proportions of CTLs and Tc17 cells, when compared to young mothers (p=0.023 and p=0.015); 3) older mothers had lower proportions of thymic Th9 cells than young mothers (p=0.035); 4) fetuses from older mothers had increased proportions of activated CD25+ (p=0.001), IL4+ (p=0.007) and IL9+ (p=0.007) CD8+ T cells, Tc17 cells (p=0.05), and CTLs (p=0.007) in the thymus than fetuses from young mothers; and 5) neonates from older mothers had lower proportions of Tregs (p= 0.04) and higher proportions of Th1 (p=0.001) and Th17 cells (p=0.001), and CD8+IL9+ T cells (p=0.002) than neonates from young mothers. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced maternal age has adverse effects on the T-cell repertoire of the mother and offspring. Advanced maternal age impairs the pro-inflammatory response at the maternal-fetal interface required for on-time parturition, and drives a systemic pro-inflammatory state in the offspring. These novel findings may explain why older mothers undergo dystocia and their offspring die shortly after birth. (EPAB) is an RNA-binding protein expressed exclusively in germ cells and early embryos prior to zygotic genome activation (ZGA). EPAB is required for translational activation of maternally-stored mRNAs in the oocyte and Epab -/female mice are infertile due to impaired oocyte maturation. In addition, folliculogenesis is disrupted in Epab -/females and cumulus expansion and ovulation rates are significantly impaired. The aim of this study was to characterize the molecular mechanisms of follicular somatic cell dysfunction in Epab -/mice. METHODS: First, we determined whether the defect in cumulus expansion and ovulation in Epab -/mice is due to factors inherent to the oocyte. To do this, we utilized a co-culture system of oocytectomized cumulus oophorus complexes (OOX) with denuded oocytes. Cumulus expansion was evaluated following 16 h of culture with or without 10ng/ ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), which mediates luteinizing hormone (LH) action during cumulus expansion. qRT-PCR was performed to assess the expression of downstream mediators of LH/EGF [prostaglandinendoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2 or Cox2), betacellulin (Btc), and tumor necrosis factor alpha induced protein 6 (Tnfaip6)] in cumulus cells. Western analysis was used to assess the activation of ERK cascade in WT and Epab -/granulosa cells in culture after stimulation with LH (1mg/ml), EGF (10ng/ml) or amphiregullin (AREG, 100ng/ml) for 5 min or 10 min. Expression of oocyte derived growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) and bone morphogenic protein 15 (BMP15) was similarly tested. RESULTS: EGF treatment of WT OOX/WT oocyte co-culture resulted in normal cumulus cells expansion with increased expression of Ptgs2, Btc and Tnfaip6 (p<0.05 for each transcript). In contrast, when WT OOX was co-cultured with Epab -/oocytes, cumulus expansion did not occur and the expression of Ptgs2, Btc, and Tnfaip6 did not change. Compared to WT, Epab -/oocytes did not show a difference in GDF9 or BMP15 expression. Granulosa cells of Epab -/mice showed impaired response to LH, EGF and AREG treatment, with decreased expression of downstream mediators p-MEK1/2, p-ERK1/2, and p90RSK (p<0.05).",

            "text": "Characterizing INTRODUCTION: Success in fertility treatment often depends upon the ability of gametes and early embryos to adapt appropriately to the stress imparted on them from exposure to a culture environment. Early embryos express the constituents of several well-known stress response pathways in an effort to mitigate adverse responses to culture. Our research focuses on p66Shc, a cellular stress sensor protein that regulates mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production. We hypothesize that p66Shc is integral to the early embryo's culture adaptive stress response mechanisms. As a prelude to defining p66Shc function in preimplantation development and in response to culture, we have investigated p66Shc expression and localization and the influence of culture on these parameters. METHODS: p66Shc transcript abundance and protein localization in mouse preimplantation embryos collected in vivo and after in vitro culture was characterized by RT-qPCR and immunofluorescent confocal microscopy. Mature oocytes and zygotes were collected from the oviducts of female mice, while 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, morula and blastocyst-stage embryos were either collected in vivo from oviducts or after in vitro culture at 37\u00baC/5% O 2 /5% CO 2 humidified microenvironment. RESULTS: In vivo, p66Shc transcript abundance significantly decreased from the mature oocyte to 2-cell stage (p<0.05) and remained low to the blastocyst stage. In vitro, p66Shc transcript abundance also decreased from the 2-cell stage to the blastocyst stage (p<0.05). Interestingly, p66Shc expression significantly decreased in in vitro cultured 2-cell embryos compared to in vivo stage matched controls (p<0.05). Similarly, in vivo 2-cell embryos displayed enhanced immunofluorescence intensities of total p66Shc compared to in vitro cultured 2-cell embryos. Serine 36-phosphorylated (pSer36) p66Shc localized to the nuclei from the 2-cell stage onwards in both in vivo and in vitro cultured embryos. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that p66Shc transcript is accumulated and stored in the oocyte and may be degraded prematurely and inappropriately during in vitro culture. Unexpectedly, pSer36-p66Shc was localized to the nucleus in early embryos. Future work will determine the role of p66Shc during preimplantation embryo development and during the in vitro adaptive stress response. Human IVF embryos of different developmental stages and competencies were analyzed using immunohistochemical, microscopic, and cytogenetic techniques to quantify and characterize such nuclear abnormalities and determine their relevance to developmental potential. METHODS: Three types of IVF embryos with different developmental potential were fixed, stained, and imaged using confocal microscopy: 89 cryopreserved \"good\" quality cleavage stage IVF embryos, 44 cryopreserved \"good\" quality IVF blastocysts, and 13 \"poor\" quality fresh embryos that had arrested. DNA staining (Hoechst) was used to identify extra nuclear DNA and centromere antibody (CENP-A) staining was used to better understand the mechanism in which it was formed (DNA fragment, whole chromosome). 19%) blastomeres contained centromere negative abnormalities, and 21/103 (20%) blastomeres contained both centromere positive and centromere negative abnormalities. Six additional \"good\" quality cryopreserved cleavage stage embryos were thawed, imaged, and blastomeres dissociated and karyotyped. Of the three embryos containing microscopic nuclear abnormalities, 9/12 (75%) blastomeres were aneuploid and 3/12 (25%) blastomeres were euploid. Of the three microscopically normal cleavage stage embryos, 2/18 blastomeres (11%) were aneuploid and 16/18 (89%) blastomeres were euploid.",

            "text": "The presence of abnormal nuclear formation in IVF is common, negatively associated with developmental potential, and may be associated with aneuploidy. Meiosis is central to germ cell development and requires a single round of DNA replication followed by two successive steps of chromosome segregation. Anomalies in chromosome segregation lead to aneuploidy, an abnormal chromosome number. Aneuploidy is a major cause of pregnancy loss, infertility, and birth defects, yet the molecular basis of the defects is poorly understood. Sister chromatid cohesion, a process mediated by proteins called cohesins, is crucial to ensure accurate chromosome segregation. Here, we present novel interactions between cohesin proteins and CHTF18 during meiosis. CHTF18 is a member of the Replication Factor C -like (RLC) complexes that play a role in DNA replication and sister chromatid cohesion in yeast and in human cell lines. We recently demonstrated essential roles for CHTF18 in mammalian meiosis. Mutant mice lacking CHTF18 (called Chtf18-null) are subfertile, meiotic recombination is defective, and homologous chromosomes separately prematurely during prophase I. Our objective in the current study was to investigate the mechanism underlying premature homologue disjunction in Chtf18-null mice. METHODS: Testis nuclear and whole cell protein extracts were prepared from wild-type and Chtf18-null male mice at postnatal day 16. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed and protein expression was determined by western blot analysis using antibodies to CHTF18 and cohesin proteins. Triton-X-100 and centrifugation were used to fractionate cells into soluble proteins and insoluble chromatin-bound proteins. Protein levels were quantitated with densitometry and statistical analyses were performed with the unpaired t-test. RESULTS: CHTF18 co-immunoprecipitated with all of the cohesin complex subunits. Although absence of CHTF18 did not affect cohesin protein expression, meiosis-specific cohesins bound to chromatin were significantly decreased during prophase I. Furthermore, the decrease in meiosis-specific cohesins bound to chromatin was sensitive to increasing salt concentration. CONCLUSIONS: CHTF18 stabilizes or maintains meiosis-specific cohesins on chromatin during prophase I, likely ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during mammalian meiosis. These findings have important implications for the molecular basis of aneuploidy in humans.",

While we attempted to remove glycans from living human spermatozoa using glycosidases, we found human sperm cells treated with endobeta-galactosidase (EBG), which specifically hydrolyzes poly-Nacetyllactosamine type glycans (polyLacs), moved more rapidly than untreated sperm.We investigated the mechanism underlying EBGtriggered sperm motility and found that seminal fluid polyLacs down regulate sperm motility by impairing fibroblast growth factor-dependent signaling. METHODS: Sperm and seminal fluid samples were obtained from healthy 20 study volunteers. RESULTS: Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that sperm-associated polyLacs are heavily fucosylated, consistent with Lewis Y antigen. Immunohistochemistry of epididymis using an anti-Lewis Y antibody before and after EBG treatment suggested that polyLacs carrying the Lewis Y epitope are synthesized in epididymal epithelia and secreted to seminal fluid.

RESULTS: As expected, two marker of decidualization (IGF-1 and prolactin (PRL)) were induced 15-and 9-fold 72 h after initiation of cAMP/MPA (p<0.01). Likewise, secreted PRL increased from 166 \u00b1 65 to 12389 \u00b1 429 pg/mL (p<0.01) and IGFBP-1 from 30 \u00b1 6 to 247 \u00b1 37 pg/mL (p<0.01). Treatment with plasma thrombin (0.5-6 U/ml) decreased transcripts encoding IGF-1, IGFBP-1, and PRL at baseline (71-73%, P<0.04) in a dose-and time-dependent manner with maximal effects at 72h. Interestingly, thrombin (2 U/ml) also inhibited decidualizationinduced expression of IGF-1 as well as decreased PRL and IGFBP-1 mRNA from 9.7\u00b11.5 to 5.5\u00b10.6 R.U./GAPDH (p=0.057) and 18.9\u00b13.6 to 12.5\u00b11.3 R.U./GAPDH (p<0.01) respectively. Similarly thrombin decreased secreted prolactin and IGFBP-1 at baseline (54-50%) and 72 h after decidualization (13-14%). Thrombin induced MMP1 at baseline (7-fold, p<0.01) and during decidualization (11.4-fold, P<0.01). Basal COX-2 mRNA was also induced 8-fold and amplified in cells undergoing decidualization (from 4-to 7.7-fold).

Recombinant thrombin mimicked the effects of plasma thrombin suggesting that these effects were not due to contamination. Like thrombin, PAR-1 agonist inhibited IGF-1, PRL, LOX, and Col1a1. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data indicate that thrombin adversely affects decidualization in vitro primarily through PAR-1. Furthermore, thrombin not only activates genes involved in matrix degradation (MMPs) and inflammation (COX-2), but also suppresses genes important for collagen formation (Col1a1, LOX). The results suggest that intrauterine bleeding and generation of thrombin disrupts matrix homeostasis of the endometrium, impairs decidualization, and endometrial support of early pregnancy.",

Aging is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes, and studies have shown that changes in the uterine microstructure affect implantation success. Little is known about age-related changes occurring between the peri-implantation period and term pregnancy. Here, we investigated pregnancy loss at several periods throughout gestation in young and aged rats to enable detailed mechanistic investigations into causes of age-related pregnancy loss. METHODS: Aged female Sprague Dawley rats (9.5 months; approximately equivalent to a 35 year old woman) and young controls (4 months) were mated with young males. Implantation was assessed on gestational day (GD)5, GD8, GD15, and GD20. RESULTS: On GD5 pregnancy success was lower in aged rats (young: 100%; aged: 66%), although preliminary data suggest that of the rats that were pregnant, the number of implantation sites between young and aged dams was not different. On GD8, 9/9 young dams were pregnant, compared to 7/11 aged (P<0.05 by Chi-square test). Aged pregnant dams had 39% fewer implantation sites (young=15.2\u00b10.8, vs. aged=9.3\u00b11.7 implantation sites, P<0.01), and of those implantation sites, more of them were undergoing various stages of resorption (young=0 vs. aged=5.6\u00b12.0 resorptions, P<0.01); similar results were observed on GD15. Overall, by GD20, aged dams had a reduced capacity to carry a viable pregnancy to term (young=90% vs. aged=50%), and had reduced litter sizes (young=15.0\u00b10.57 pups vs. aged=8.5\u00b11.6 pups, P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy in aged dams is impaired early, which is attributed to both implantation failure and miscarriage. These results are dramatic given the aged rats used in this study are otherwise healthy, without existing comorbidities. This model of advanced maternal age will enable the assessment of mechanisms underpinning the pregnancy loss, including those pertaining to oocyte quality, embryo developmental competence, spiral remodelling and depth of trophoblast invasion. family.

TRPV4 could be detected in the plasma membrane and showed cytoplasmic vesicle, whereas TRPC6 protein was more abundantly expressed in the perinuclear area. Further functional characterization by Ca 2+ -microfluorimetry and whole-cell patch-clamp techniques using specific pharmacology, provided evidence for functional expression of TRPV2, TRPV4, TRPC6, and TRPM7 in human stromal cells. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we have demonstrated via different experimental approaches the functional expression of TRPV2, TRPV4, TRPC6, and TRPM7 in human endometrial stromal cells. Further research is required to investigate the possible role of these ion channels in the epithelial-stromal crosstalk during the process of embryo implantation.",

PCR amplicons were verified by gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: Five metabolites (lactate, glucose, acetate, alanine, glutamine/ glutamate) were identified. There was a significantly higher acetate integral in preterm SYM women compared to the other groups (2-way ANOVA, p<0.05). Although not significant, term ALR women showed the highest lactate integral with a trend to lower lactate in term AHR (p=0.29) and the lowest for the preterm SYM groups (p=0.06). No other differences were found in relation to delivery outcomes. PCR revealed several commensal Lactobacillus sp. and PTB associated organisms. The later were found in a higher proportion of SYM group. CONCLUSIONS: Higher amounts of vaginal lactate may be associated with reduced risk of PTB, while high acetate levels in vaginal secretions appear to be associated with an increased risk of PTB. Progesterone is essential for establishment and maintenance of pregnancy and its withdrawal converts the myometrium to the laboring state. Human parturition is triggered by a functional progesterone withdrawal through changes in the progesterone receptor (PR) signaling in myometrial cells. The human PR exists as two main isoforms, PR-A and PR-B. We hypothesize that functional progesterone withdrawal is at least in part mediated by post-translational modifications of the PRs; especially serine phosphorylation (pSer). We tested this hypothesis by determining the changes in the pattern of serine phosphorylation on PRs in association with labor status in term human myometrium.",

The regulation of PR pSer by progesterone was examined in the hTERT-HM A/B immortalized human myometrial cell line. RESULTS: Immunoblotting using commercially available pSer PR antibodies showed that pSer at serine 345 was the most abundant form of pSer-PR and was only detected on PR-A. pSer345-PR immunoreactivity was localized to the nucleus of myometrial cells. The relative abundance of pSer345-PRA decreased significantly (P<0.05) in association with the onset of labor. In hTERT-HM A/B cells, pSer345 was induced by progesterone within 15 minutes and in a dose dependent manner and was predominantly on PR-A. CONCLUSIONS: In term human myometrium serine 345 is phosphorylated on PR-A. In other studies pSer345 causes PRs to tether with other transcription factors such as AP-1 and SP-1. This modification may be involved in the process of parturition through its potential effects on the transcriptional activity of PR-A in myometrial cells. treatment.

We examined the functional interaction of these processes using mathematical modeling on existing transcriptome datasets from laboring and quiescent term myometrium.

PLSDA score plots showed much greater separation of cases and controls at 20 weeks than 15 weeks with the 2 cases that delivered earliest furthest from controls. Random forest classification showed much improved classification at 20 weeks versus 15 weeks with error rates as low as 0.221. Quantifying dysregulation by outlier methods also shows that much greater dysregulation of metabolomic profiles is evident at 20 weeks than 15 weeks. Furthermore the two cases that are closest to delivery at 20 weeks having gestational age at 22 and 23.7 weeks show markedly increased dysregulation compare to other cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary findings show that the closer to delivery the more markedly perturbed the metabolomic profile. We consistently find through a vareity of analysis methods that the two cases in our cohort that deliverd at 22 and 23.7 weeks show highly dysregulated profiles at the 20 week time point and are the most discriminatory cases as seen on PLSDA score plots. This points towards the possibility of developing a highly specific and sensitive test to predict SPTB that will occur within 4 weeks. We await validation data to confirm our findings and to further investigate this possibility. INTRODUCTION: Preterm birth is defined by birth of a baby at less than 37 weeks of gestational age and is the most common catastrophic and costly complication of pregnancy. Numerous studies have provided compelling evidence that IL-6 produced by the decidua in response to inflammation plays a role in the pathophysiology of preterm labor. However, there are no appropriate therapeutic interventions available to circumvent inflammation-mediated preterm labor. Curcumin, a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound, has been widely used as an alternative therapeutic agent to treat inflammatory and infectious diseases. Yet, very little is known about the anti-inflammatory effect of curcumin in the uterine environment. Therefore, the goal of this study was to identify whether curcumin can be used as a safe and effective pharmacological compound in the prevention of inflammation-mediated preterm birth.",

Cell culture studies demonstrated that curcumin completely inhibited the expression of IL-1\u03b2-induced IL-6 as well as gp130, whereas expression of IL-6R was not affected. Furthermore, curcumin treatment inhibited phosphorylation of STAT3, which is a downstream effector of IL-6 signaling. We also found that curcumin completely attenuated IL-1\u03b2-induced IL-6 promoter activity in decidual cells. Our results further demonstrated that curcumin inhibited IKK phosphorylation, NF-kB expression and nuclear localization, while upregulating p53 in decidual cells, which was correlated with inhibition of IL-6. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results strongly suggest that curcumin effectively prevented LPS-induced preterm labor and this may be mediated through the inhibition of IL-6 at the level transcription by a mechanism involving opposing effects of NF-kB and p53. We defined a decidual hemorrhage SPTB (PTB/DH) phenotype based on clinical data, including the presence of vaginal bleeding at anytime during pregnancy, placental pathology and other factors. Cases with PTB/ DH were compared first to a subset of the term controls without DH (TB/ No DH). We also performed an interaction test including all cases and controls to identify SNPs that interact with hemorrhage to result in PTB. Significance of each analysis was determined by logistic regression, adjusted for three principal components to account for population stratification. The results of each test were analyzed for genelevel association using VEGAS, which calculates significance levels for 17,744 known genes. All genes with p<0.05 in the VEGAS results were analyzed for pathway enrichment using InnateDB. RESULTS: 698 mothers with a history of PTB (cases) and 715 mothers with no history of PTB (controls) were included. Among them, 30% of cases and 3.4% of controls had DH. Although no SNPs achieved genome-wide significance (p<5e-8) in either analysis, the best result from each analysis falls near SNPs previously associate with age at menarche. VEGAS identified one gene (ZNF681, p<1e-6) as significantly associated in the test of cases with hemorrhage versus controls without. 900 genes with a p< 0.05 were included in the pathway analysis. The \"co-stimulatory signal during t-cell activation\" pathway was significantly over-represented among PTB/DH cases (adj. p=0.006). 92 pathways had p<0.05 pathways were not significantly over-represented in women with PTB/DH. CONCLUSIONS: Although no single SNP reached genome-wide significance, the ZNF681 gene and \"co-stimulatory signal during t-cell activation\" pathway were significantly associated with PTB/DH. that have yet to be fully characterised. The myometrial primary cell culture model is well established for studying the mechanisms of progesterone action in vitro. However, it is limited by the significant reduction of progesterone receptor levels when compared to tissues and the need for the use of supra-physiological progesterone doses (10\u00b5M) to elicit a response to cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2. This study sought to establish an alternative ex vivo model to study the mechanism of progesterone action. METHODS: Myometrium samples obtained from consenting women undergoing elective caesarean section at term were dissected into explants measuring 3x3x3mm 3 and placed in DMEM supplemented with L-glutamine and penicillin-streptomycin. The explants were treated for 6 hours with progesterone (1 or 10\u00b5M) or ethanol vehicle prior to addition of IL-1\u03b2 (10ng/mL) or water vehicle for a further 24 hours, at which point all tissues were snap-frozen. Whole tissue protein extracts were prepared via bead homogenisation and western blotting was used for COX-2, 11\u03b2HSD1 and GAPDH estimation. RNA was extracted and following cDNA synthesis, qPCR was conducted for COX-2 and GAPDH.",

The use of shortterm myometrial explant cultures offers a novel method of assessing the molecular mechanisms of progesterone action offering many advantages over primary cell culture. Using this model, further studies will be undertaken to establish the mechanism of action of progesterone via selective pharmacological inhibition of the progesterone and/or glucocorticoid receptors. Our work showed that stiffness varies along the length of the cervix and there are aligned and organized scattering sources in the cervix. These observations suggest that acoustic attenuation likely varies along the length of the cervix and that attenuation is likely dependent on the angle of interrogation relative to the scattering sources. However, these sources of variance were not accounted for in previous studies. In this work, we test the hypothesis that spatial location along the length of the cervix and angle of interrogation relative to the canal contribute significantly to attenuation coefficient estimates, and by controlling for these sources of variance attenuation estimates are more sensitive to cervical ripening status. METHODS: Cervix specimens were obtained from premenopausal women undergoing hysterectomy for benign reasons. There were three groups of women: those unripened (n=5), those experiencing uterine bleeding (n=5), and those given 400 mg of misoprostol 10-12 hours prior to surgery (n=4). The specimens were positioned so that the endocervical canal was parallel to the transducer face and scanned with a Siemens Acuson S2000 and an 18L6 linear array transducer. Radiofrequency echo signals were collected with the acoustic beams steered from -32 o to +32 o in steps of 4 o and attenuation was calculated using the Reference Phantom Method. The internal os and external os locations were used to group the attenuation measurements among specimens based on fractional distance from the external os. Attenuation anisotropy (angle of interrogation dependence of attenuation estimates) was estimated by subtracting the attenuation estimate for 0 o data and comparing results as a function of beam steering angle. RESULTS: There was a significant difference (p=0.007) in attenuation estimates among spatial locations along the cervix. The attenuation also varied with angle of interrogation. Attenuation anisotropy increased linearly with steering angles (0.6 dB cm -1 MHz -1 range at the mid-proximal location). Accounting for spatial location and angle of interrogation, there was significantly different attenuation estimates among ripening states. (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with the presence of spatially-dependent aligned collagen in the cervix and suggest great promise for monitoring cervical change.",

Human parturition is regarded as an inflammatory process, in which the pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2, are involved. A number of transcription factors, including NF-\u03baB and AP-1 are activated, which lead to the expression of labour-associated genes such as COX-2. Progesterone (P4) probably exerts an anti-inflammatory role to maintain uterine quiescence during pregnancy and P4 withdrawal leads to the onset of labour. Our previous data showed that P4 acts via GR to repress IL-1\u03b2-driven COX-2 expression. In this study, we have investigated other IL-1\u03b2 responsive genes and aim to explore the mechanisms by which P4 represses the effect of IL-1\u03b2 in human myometrial cells.

We hypothesize that decreased expression of mPR\u03b1 contributes to the diminished P4 responsiveness before labor. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the expression of mPR\u03b1 and other reproduction-related genes in uterus, placenta and fetal membrane at different gestational ages (GAs) in mice. METHODS: RNA samples were extracted from uterus, placenta, and fetal membrane (n=2-6) collected at E12.5, E14.5, E15.5, E16.5, E17.5, E18.5, or postpartum (E20.5) according to timed pregnancy. The levels of transcripts were detected by RT-PCR and normalized to the levels of Gapdh. Statistical testing was by nonlinear or linear regression followed by stepdown bootstrap analysis. RESULTS: Mouse uterus demonstrates polynominal expression patterns for Paqr7, steroid receptor coactivator 2 (Ncoa2) and cyclic AMPresponsive element-binding protein 3 (Creb3), with expression increasing with advancing GA, peaking by E16.5 and declining before the initiation of labor (at E18.5). In addition, COX-1 (Ptgs1) expression in uterus increases with advancing GA to E18.5 and declines postpartum to a level similar to that of E12.5. Uterine progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (Pgrmc1) and Il-1\u03b2 levels rise significantly after labor. In placenta and fetal membrane, the levels of Paqr7, Ncoa2 and Creb3 rise with GA and do not decline before labor. CONCLUSIONS: Uterine mPR\u03b1 steadily increases in early pregnancy and is down-regulated preceding both term and induced preterm labor in mice, whereas mPR\u03b1 in placenta and fetal membrane rises through pregnancy and does not decline before labor. We speculate that regulated expression of Paqr7 and nPR coactivators Ncoa2 and Creb3 might contribute to altered P4 sensitivity in uterus, placenta and fetal membrane throughout pregnancy and as labor approaches. Parturition is an inflammatory process mediated to a significant extent by macrophages. Progesterone maintains quiescence in pregnancy, and a proposed functional withdrawal of progesterone classically regulated by nuclear progesterone receptors (nPRs) leads to labor. Progesterone can impact the functions of macrophages despite the absence of expression of nPRs in these immune cells. Therefore, in this study we investigated the effects of activation of the putative membraneassociated progesterone receptors (mPRs) on macrophage functions and discuss the implications of these findings for pregnancy and parturition. METHODS: Murine macrophage cells (RAW264.7) were pretreated without or with 20 \u00b5M PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK1/2, or 30 \u00b5M H89, a known PKA inhibitor, for one hour. This was followed by incubation with control or P4 modified to be active only extracellularly by conjugation to BSA (P4BSA, 100nM) for two, 15 and 30 minutes for signal transduction experiments or for four hours for mRNA and protein isolation. RT-PCR was used to examine mRNA expression levels and western blotting was used to evaluate phosphorylation levels of signal transduction components and protein expression. RESULTS: Activation of mPRs by P4BSA (100nM) caused a proinflammatory shift in mRNA expression profile, with significant upregulation of the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (Ptgs2), Il-1B, and Tnf and down-regulation of mPR-alpha (Paqr7) and oxytocin receptor (Oxtr). Pretreatment with PD98059, a MEK 1/2 inhibitor significantly reduced P4BSA-induced Ptgs2, Il-1B, and Tnf mRNA. Inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) by H89 blocked P4BSA-induced Il-1B and Tnf mRNA levels. Pretreatment with either PD98059 or H89 also significantly diminished P4BSA-induced IL-1\u03b2 protein expression. In addition, P4BSA induced rapid phosphorylation (within 2 mins of treatment) of MEK1/2 at Ser217/221 and CREB at Ser133 as determined by immunoblotting, and PD98059 and H89 pretreatment reduced P4BSA-induced MEK1/2 and CREB phosphorylation, respectively, confirming the involvement of MEK1/2 and PKA in this pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Activation of mPRs leads to decreased Paqr7 expression and increased MEK1/2-and PKA-dependent inflammatory responses. We speculate that changes in mPR expression or activation by progesterone may represent a novel pathway that contributes to the regulation of inflammatory responses in macrophages. Identifying robust combinations of informative biomarkers could benefit from advanced metabolomic analytical tools. In order to address this, an unbiased and untargeted metabolomic study of both term and preterm amniotic fluid samples was performed using several analytical and data processing strategies. METHODS: State-of-the-art gas-phase separations using ion mobility and mass spectrometry were utilized in the analysis of amniotic fluid samples of both term (n = 5; >37 weeks) and preterm (n = 5; 22-32 wks) pregnancies. Reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) and supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) coupled to ion mobilitymass spectrometry (IM-MS) (nanoAcquity, UPC 2 and Synapt G2-S, Waters, MA) provide a great advantage of higher metabolome coverage since separations are based upon different physicochemical properties. This increases both selectivity and sensitivity in assessing significant differences between sample groups. A self-organizing map (SOM) approach (MEDI, Molecular Expression Dynamics Investigator) was used to filter the high dimensional data into analytes that distinguish the sample groups. Specifically, the MEDI approach compares and groups over-and under-abundant metabolites to prioritize differences between term and preterm metabolome. RESULTS: MEDI images show significant differences between the metabolome of term and preterm amniotic fluid samples, where several putative metabolites were detected. These images cluster metabolites with similar expression profiles and converts complex multidimensional data into two-dimensional heat maps. Out of 2049 molecular features detected by both RPLC and SFC, 298 metabolites were found to significantly differ with a p-value of <0.01 between term and preterm samples.",

Prior to delivery, mice were euthanized, uterine and decidual tissues were obtained, and leukocytes were isolated for immunophenotyping. Within the macrophage (CD11b+F4/80+) or neutrophil (CD11b+Ly6G+) gates, the expression of MHCII, iNOS, Arg1, or IL4 was determined by flow cytometry as proportions. MMP-9 activity in cervical leukocytes was determined by in situ zymography. Plasma progesterone, estradiol, and cytokine concentrations were quantified using ELISA or a multiplex assay. Additionally, pregnant mice pretreated with VP4 or Replens were injected with an endotoxin (10mg, n=10 each). Mice were monitored via infrared camera until delivery. A p-value of \u00a30.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: 1) Administration of VP4 caused a reduction of MHCII+ and IFN\u03b3+ neutrophils in the uterine tissues (p=0.03 and 0.021, respectively); 2)administration of VP4 caused a reduction of M1-like (iNOS+IFN\u03b3+) macrophages in the uterine tissues (p=0.06); 3) cervical leukocytes that express active MMP9 were fewer in mice treated with VP4 than in the controls (p=0.032); 4) plasma IL1\u03b2 concentrations were lower in mice treated with VP4 than in the controls (p=0.05); 5) no differences in plasma progesterone or estradiol concentrations were seen between mice treated with VP4 and Replens; and 6) administration of VP4 caused a reduction in PTB in mice injected with an endotoxin (40% vs. 90%). CONCLUSIONS: Administration of VP4 results in an anti-inflammatory micro-environment at the maternal-fetal interface by reducing proinflammatory macrophages and neutrophils. In addition, administration of VP4 reduces the infiltration of active MMP-9+ leukocytes in the cervix and decreases the rate of endotoxin-induced PTB. These findings provide further evidence about the mechanisms of action of VP4 in preventing PTB. ",

CONCLUSIONS: In this population of Indigenous Australian women, the incidence of high BP is low, but there is an increased prevalence of proteinuria.

The higher urinary angiotensinogen/creatinine in pregnant women with proteinuria is in accordance with observations made in non-pregnant populations.

CONCLUSIONS: In this exploratory study, higher serum levels of heavy metals were not associated with spontaneous PTB. Our study is strengthened by its reliance on prospective 1st trimester measurements rather than using proxies such as occupational/residential history or postpartum serum measurements. . 10 of these also increased in chPTL samples compared to PNL, and a further 3 (IL6, CXCL2 and CCL1; p\u00a30.05) increased in both chPTL and iPTL. Interestingly eotaxin-3, TNF\u03b1 and CCL25 only increased in chPTL (p\u00a30.05) but not TL, and MIG increased in iPTL only (p\u00a30.05). Furthermore increased expression of chemokines/cytokines was not observed in twins PTL or abruption PTL. CONCLUSIONS: Cytokine/chemokine-mediated inflammation appears to be a consequence rather than the cause of TL, where it is most likely involved in the reparative & remodelling of the uterus. Both chPTL & iPTL are associated with acute inflammatory response with chPTL displaying a more intense inflammatory response than iPTL. PTL secondary to twins or abruption does not appear to be mediated by an inflammatory response but by other pathways which are still yet to be identified. There is no current evidence from randomised trials to inform best practice for delivery when malposition complicates the second stage. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology has recommended training in instrumental deliveries to control and reduce rates of emergency CS. Manual rotation (MROT) is widely used to correct malposition in the second stage, but no modern data is available on how best to carry out the procedure, or on efficacy or safety. METHODS: Anonymous questionnaire was administered to obstetricians focusing on preferred method for rotational delivery and the use of, indication and documentation of MROT. 1862 deliveries requiring assistance for malposition at full dilatation were analysed during the 6 year retrospective/prospective study, this included 365 MROT deliveries. We compared fetal and maternal outcomes for MROT with all other forms of operative assisted deliveries for malposition, rotational ventouse (RV), Kielland forceps (KF) and 2 nd stage CS without a trial of instrumental delivery (pEMCS).",

The prospective groups had similar failure rates despite method of rotation used (MROT 17.5%; RV 17.2%; KF 13.8%). The incidence of massive obstetric haemorrhage was highest following CS in both the prospective and retrospective groups. The overall incidence of anal sphincter injury was much lower than nationally expected; KF carried the highest risk at just 2.6%.

The studies in our tertiary centre confirm MROT's use and comparative outcomes with other methods of delivery when malposition complicates the second stage.

IL-6 and its signaling component glycoprotein (gp)130 also play a key role in the onset of parturition. We showed that PGF 2\u03b1 stimulation induces output of IL-6 by HMSMC. In this study, we hypothesize that HMSMC express the four IL-1R genes and that they are regulated by PGF 2\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. We also investigate whether IL-1\u03b2, with or without PGF 2\u03b1 treatment, stimulates IL-6R and gp130. METHODS: Myometrial biopsies were retrieved from women not in labor at term, following caesarean section and HMSMC prepared (n=5-9). Cells were pre-treated with 5 ng/ml IL-1\u03b2 for 24h, followed by PGF 2\u03b1 (10 -7 to 10 -5 M) for 6h, or treated only with PGF 2\u03b1 . mRNA abundance of IL-1R1, IL-1R2, IL-1RAcP, IL-1RAcPb, IL-6R, gp130 and housekeeping gene GAPDH was evaluated by RT-PCR.

Acknowledgements: FWO, CIHR, MOD, GAPPS We previously found significantly higher decidual prorenin expression and protein levels in women carrying a female compared to a male fetus. We postulate that this decidual prorenin interacts with the amnion (pro)renin receptor and influences the amniotic expression of transforming growth factor-b1 (TGFB1) and prostaglandinendoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), which are involved in maintaining membrane integrity and initiation of labour. We propose, since decidual prorenin is highest in pregnancies with a female fetus, that amniotic TGFB1 expression is also higher, which may explain the lower incidence of premature rupture of membranes and preterm birth in pregnancies with a female fetus. METHODS: All tissues were collected from term uncomplicated singleton pregnancies delivered by elective caesarean section.

METHODS: Primary cultures of human myometrial cells were grown from biopsies obtained during planned caesarean section at term. Cells were treated with forskolin (100uM), and total RNAs were extracted. The concentration and purity of RNA were determined by value of OD260:280. Three samples were chosen as representatives for Affymetrix Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 Array analysis. Genes were further filtered and only those with p< 0.05 and fold change >1.5 were analysed by qPCR. 8 genes were up-regulated (11\u03b2HSD1, MKP-1, PKAR2\u03b1, GPR125, GaS, PDE4B, CCL8 and PTGES), and 5 genes were down-regulated (OTR, CREB3L1, GUCY1A3, GPR124 and PRKG1). Subsequently primary myometrial cells were treated with forskolin, 8 bromo cAMP, rolipram and dibutyryl-cAMP. Total RNA were extracted, and levels of cAMPassociated genes were measured. RESULTS: Among the genes that are up-regulated by cAMP as determined by the gene array, treatment with 8 bromo cAMP, rolipram and dibutyryl-cAMP was able to increase the mRNA levels of 11\u03b2HSD1, MKP-1, PKAR2\u03b1, GPR125, GaS, PDE4B, CCL8 and PTGES compared to control.

An inverse relationship is thus expected between eCBs and FAAH, and between FAAH and both steroids. As eCBs increase during labour, we tested the hypothesis of an inverse relationship in pregnant women at high-risk for preterm birth(PTB) METHODS: FAAH activity (radioactive substrate conversion rates) was determined in blood obtained from high-risk pregnancies(n=18) and emergency admissions with threatened PTB(n=25). Plasma E2, P4(n=36) and eCB concentrations were measured by ELISA and UHPLC-MS/MS, respectively. Pregnancy outcome (PTB & term delivery; <37 &\u2265 37 weeks respectively) was recorded. Correlations of FAAH activity with AEA, OEA, PEA, E2, P4 and E2/P4 were examined. FAAH expression (RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry(IHC)) in placentae obtained from spontaneous labourers at preterm and term, and non-labourers (elective CS) at term and preterm (n=6/group) RESULTS: Plasma E2, FAAH, P4 and the E2/P4 ratio were all higher in the PTB group compared to the term group, but the differences did not reach significance (P>0.05). There was a weak correlation between FAAH and E2(r=0.04; P=0.78), P4 (r=0.05; P=0.74) and E2/P4 ratio (r=-0.009; P=0.9), and none between FAAH activity and eCBs levels. FAAH transcript levels were respectively 70% and 68% lower in placenta from term and PTB compared to non-labouring women. Prematurity was associated with reduced FAAH expression (33%) in placentae of PTB labourers and 1.38-fold higher in those who had preterm CS; observations also confirmed by IHC CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest E2 and P4 may not be involved in the regulation of peripheral FAAH in, but is explained by the lower FAAH placental expression. Placental FAAH expression could therefore be important in PTB, but not related to circulating E2 or P4 .29) had a significant positive correlation with age.

INTRODUCTION: There has been concern for increased neonatal morbidity and mortality associated with antenatal magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) exposure, particularly in very preterm infants.

We excluded multiple gestations, fetal anomalies, and aneuploidy. Infants who received antepartum MgSO4 for any indication were compared to those who were not exposed to MgS04. The primary outcome was composite neonatal morbidity (intraventricular hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and/or death prior to hospital discharge). RESULTS: 1,246 infants were included in the analysis. 457 (36.7%) were exposed to MgSO4 and 789(63.3%) were not. Maternal demographics were similar between groups, except for BMI, which was lower in the group exposed to MgSO4 ( (Obstet Gynecol 1988; 72:746 ) established a correlation between worsening of patterns (form type 0to4) and risk of neanatal acidemia. The aim of our study was to assess its reliability in a much wider population and to evaluate the relationship between different CTG patterns and neonatal acidemia at birth. METHODS: 2-year retrospective cohort study of 2297 singleton pregnancies who delivered vaginally at our Institution. Inclusion criteria were: at least the final 60 minutes of continuous and technically interpretable trace in the first stage, a technically interpretable trace in the second stage lasting at least 10 minutes and umbilical artery gas analisys at birth. CTGs were extracted prospectively and analyzed retrospectively blind to the clinical information. Neonatal acidemia was defined by the presence of umbilical arterial cord pH of 7.10 or less. Data were analysed by multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Only 50% of our tracings in the II stage could be classified according to the original 6 types proposed by Piquard. 46.8% of tracings fit within a single class (1, 0, 2A), 53.3% were a combination of types (most frequently: 0-1). Type 1 and the combination of type 1 and 4 were associated with a fourfold and ninefold increased risk of acidemia respectively. In type 1 tracings the presence of malignant criteria, such as frequent, repetitive, prolonged or deep decelerations, were strongly associated with academia. A length of II stage >120 minutes and induction of labor were risk factors for acidemia (OR:4.3 and 1.76 respectively). The only independent risk factor for acidemia was maternal BMI (<18.5 and >25 kg/m 2 ); while maternal and pregnancy-induced disease, parity, male sex and neonatal weight at birth were not associated with acidemia. Gestational age was a protective factor. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that: only 50% of our tracings could be classified according to the classification of Piquard whereas the other represented a combination of more than 1 type; acidemia at birth could be predicted by the presence of the so called malignant criteria. These results suggest the need of a novel classifcation for the fetal heart rate in the second stage of labor The mean gestational age at evaluation was 20.6 \u00b1 1.7 weeks. The mean CL was 3.7 \u00b1 0.8 cm without contrast and 3.7 \u00b1 0.8 cm with contrast (p = 0.341). All quality criteria were seen in 46 (61%) of patients without contrast versus 52 (69%) with contrast, (p = 0.23). In 7 patients (9%), \u00a32 of these metrics were clearly seen without contrast, but \u00b33 were identified after application. All landmarks were clearly visualized in 34/50 patients (68%) with 10mls applied versus 18/25 (72%) with 20 ml of methylcellulose, (p = 0.8). CONCLUSIONS: CL measurement was not altered by imaging contrast in this low risk cohort examined by experienced sonographers. Improved visualization of cervical anatomy was noted for a minority of patients, but was not statistically significant. This methodology may benefit inexperienced sonographers or more challenging cases but requires further study to define benefit.",

Among women who had their first cesarean for arrest disorders, 27% underwent TOLAC and 68% had a VBAC. Of women with a prior vaginal birth, 45% underwent TOLAC and 91% had a VBAC. CONCLUSIONS: Women whose characteristics predict a higher likelihood of VBAC are more likely to choose TOLAC; however, the majority of these women still choose ERCD. While patient preference should remain paramount, improving counseling to ensure that optimal candidates understand their likelihood of VBAC may improve the decision making process, which may ultimately decrease the CD rate and help avoid the morbidity associated with TOLAC ending in CD. Two measurements greater than the 95th percentile were required to establish the diagnosis of a large fetal stomach. Ultrasound, antepartum, delivery and neonatal records were reviewed. Fetuses with associated major structural anomalies were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 470 cases of large fetal stomach were identified. 272 cases met inclusion criteria (singleton pregnancy, no GI or other major anomalies diagnosed on ultrasound i.e. gastroschisis, omphalocele, duodenal atresia, major cardiac or neurologic anomalies). Median gestational age of large stomach diagnosis was 21 weeks. Large fetal stomach was seen on only one ultrasound and subsequently resolved in 159 cases (59%). It persisted over two or more ultrasounds and subsequently resolved in 27 cases (10%). It persisted over two or more ultrasounds and remained enlarged on the last ultrasound prior to delivery in 36 cases (13%). Follow-up ultrasounds were not available in 49 cases (18%). Neonatal outcome data was available in 151 cases (56%). Two neonates had GI problems diagnosed postnatally; in one case, malrotation and GERD were diagnosed during infancy; in the other case, distal esophageal stricture with tracheobronchial remnants on pathology was diagnosed during childhood. In both of these cases, workup was initiated because of postnatal symptoms. In one case a postnatal GI workup was initiated solely on the basis of ultrasound findings and revealed no abnormalities. There were no fetal deaths in utero or neonatal deaths. Twelve of the neonates had prolonged hospital stays after birth, but never for GI problems. Twenty six had known normal karyotype, 3 had abnormal karyotype, and the remainder did not have any testing for aneuploidy. CONCLUSIONS: Large fetal stomach is often associated with other anomalies and in those cases should prompt a detailed fetal evaluation. This retrospective study suggests that there are no postnatal consequences when enlarged fetal stomach is seen as an isolated finding on ultrasound.

This compliance rate and the 74% of subjects achieving good (i.e., \u00b3 75%) compliance were comparable between those who received cranberry capsules and placebo. Compliance evaluation revealed that most subjects stopped capsule consumption after 34-38 weeks of participation. Multivariate logistic regression and longitudinal analysis showed a significant interaction time effect with cranberry treatment. However, cranberry consumption was not a significant predictor ofgastrointestinal intolerance or study withdrawal. While 30% of subjects withdrew for variety of reasons, only one subject withdrew due to intolerance to the cranberry capsules. Loss to follow-up was mostly due to provider change (9/49, 18%) and therapy disinterest (4/49, 8%). Seven cases of ASB occurred in five subjects, with 2/24 (8%) in cranberry-and 3/25 (12%) in placebo-treated subjects.

Thus, the expression of these proteins in human fetal membranes (FM) at term and preterm was examined METHODS: FM acquired from four groups of women; spontaneous labourers having vaginal delivery at term and preterm and non-labouring women having elective Caesarean section at term or prematurely (n=6 per group) were subjected to immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the presence of CB1, CB2, FAAH and NAPE-PLD and RT-qPCR for transcript levels (presented as means) RESULTS: Labour had similar effects on CB1 and CB2 expression with CB1 being increased 5% and 35% in term and preterm FM, respectively whilst CB2 transcript levels decreased by 59% and 36%, respectively. The expression of NAPE-PLD also increased (473% and 39% in term and preterm FM, respectively). By contrast, FAAH expression increased by 15% in term FM, BUT decreased by 49% in preterm FM. These observations were confirmed by IHC. The increase in NAPE-PLD expression correlates with the observed increase in AEA at term. The massive decrease in FAAH expression in PTB explains the plasma AEA increase in women who deliver preterm The effect of prematurity (in the absence of labour) on ECS gene expression was more striking. CB1 was decreased by 44% (0.56 vs1.0), CB2 increased by 76% (1.76 vs1.0), NAPE-PLD increased by 42% (1.42 vs1.0) and FAAH expression decreased by 33% (0.66 vs1.0).",

These data suggest that the ECS is dramatically dysregulated in the FM of women at risk of PTB. and its synthesizing enzyme NAPE-PLD are expressed in the placenta, the effect of labour on that expression remains unknown. That the CB1 knockout mouse undergoes PTB, suggests CB1 expression is altered in women at risk of PTB. Placental CB1, CB2 and NAPE-PLD expression in women delivering prematurely or at term (<37 & \u00b337 weeks respectively) was therefore determined to see if this was affected as predicted. METHODS: Samples (6 per group) collected from 4 groups of patients: spontaneous vaginal deliveries (TVD) term and preterm (PTVD), nonlabouring elective Caesarean sections (CS) at term and preterm were subjected to RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CB1, CB2 and NAPE-PLD expression. RESULTS: CB1 transcript levels decreased by 86% in TVD and 91% in PTVD compared to CS samples, suggesting that CB1 expression is affected by labour. When PTVD was compared to TVD, CB1 expression was respectively 44% and 18% lower in non-labouring and labouring states. Similarly, IHC showed placental CB1 expression in the TVD and PTVD samples to be 5-10 times lower than the in non-labouring states. In concert with the CB1 data, CB2 was decreased 76% in the TVD samples, but interestingly increased 500-fold in the PTVD samples. However, CB2 transcript levels were increased in non-labouring (1.4-fold) and laboring (3000-fold) preterm samples; observations confirmed by IHC. NAPE-PLD levels decreased 38% in the TVD group but increased 1.6-fold in the PTVD group. Prematurity caused a 33% decrease in NAPE-PLD expression in labouring placentae and 75% in non-labourers. Observations of reduced NAPE-PLD at term and increase at preterm were confirmed by IHC. CONCLUSIONS: Increased plasma AEA levels in women in labour or who deliver prematurely are explained by alterations in NAPE-PLD expression and reduced CB1 expression. The massive rise in placental CB2 expression in preterm samples suggests CB2 activation could be important in the development of PTB.

The overall proportion of birth before 24 weeks was 0.043 (95% CI 0.012-0.074). The excluded study did not report any preterm births <24 weeks (n=10). Two studies reported delivery <24 weeks in women with TVC insertion (n=64); the overall proportion of birth <24 weeks was 0.063 (95% CI 0.025-0.15). Five studies reported TAC insertion via laparotomy or laparoscopy with delivery <34 weeks (n=117). The overall proportion of preterm birth <34 weeks was 0.16 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.27). There were more serious operative complications reported after TAC insertion. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a twelve-year interval since the last published systematic review, there remains a paucity of data to guide clinical practice. Whilst the numbers remain small, regulatory bodies are recommending the use of TAC in this population. Although TAC does appear to be associated with a lower risk of delivery <24 weeks, it has a higher risk of operative complications.

Increased vimentin expression in SVD was further confirmed by western blotting of full thickness amnion. The number of epithelial cells (ECadherin expressing) from amniotic membranes obtained from C/S was significantly less than the number of mesenchymal cells (vimentin expressing). Pre-incubation of the amnion with TNF\u03b1 led to increased rupture with less pressure applied. Incubation with etodolac (a known EMT inhibitor) with and without TNF\u03b1, led to protection, increasing the pressure required for membrane rupture. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggests EMT during the process of normal labor and amniotic rupture. We hope to evaluate this in future studies to determine the mechanistic pathways that convey increased susceptibility to EMT and disruption of the amniotic membranes. If our research demonstrates that increased EMT accounts for PPROM, it would lay the foundation for a trial with EMT inhibitors to assess whether these agents also prevent PPROM. The onset of parturition involves changes in the morphology of the cervix. Currently 2 nd trimester cervical length (CL) is used as a predictive tool for preterm birth (PTB). This may be improved through the addition of further parameters assessing change in cervical morphology, such as cervical volume (CV). This prospective longitudinal study aimed to establish a reference range of CV in healthy pregnancy. Women with pre-pregnancy excisional cervical treatment (CT) are at increased risk of PTB (RR 2.19). We therefore aimed to investigate the effect of CT on cervical volume, compared to low risk controls. METHODS: Women were recruited from antenatal booking (8+0 to 15+0 weeks) and followed up at 4 timepoints in pregnancy; 16+0-19+6, 20+0-24+0, 27+0-30+0 and 32+0-36+0 weeks. At each visit CL and CV measurements were taken by transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS), with an empty bladder, using 2D and 3D/4D modalities on a Voluson E ultrasound. Data analysis for CV was performed using the Virtual Organ Computeraided AnaLysis (VOCAL TM ) software. RESULTS: 77 women had serial TVUS at 5 timepoints (n=57 controls, n=20 CT). Age, BMI and parity were comparable among the two groups. All delivered at term. CL decreased with advancing gestation while CV increased; mean CL decreased from 34 mm at timepoint A (8-15 weeks) to 22mm at timepoint E (32-36 weeks; p<00.1) and CV increased from 25cm 3 to 45cm 3 respectively *Figure(s) will be available online.",

We reveal a reduction in cervical volume in women with previous CT compared to low risk controls. Cervical volume may be used as an additional screening parameter in the prediction of preterm birth. Further investigation into cervical volume may be useful in women at risk of preterm birth Few studies have examined the potential benefits of activity restriction (AR) during pregnancy for women at low risk for preterm delivery. Recent reports have condemned AR outside of a research trial because there is no proven pregnancy benefit and adverse maternal effects have been documented. We hypothesized that AR during pregnancy may be associated with decreased risk of preterm delivery (PTD) in lowrisk women, and tested this hypothesis in a large prospective cohort study. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of the MFMU's Preterm Prediction Study, a multicenter prospective cohort study designed to study risk factors of preterm birth. We included women with a non-anomalous singleton gestation. We excluded women who at their initial visit (23-25 weeks) met the following criteria: contractions, severe back pain, US cervical length <15 mm, spotting, protruding membranes, or positive fetal fibronectin (fFN). Women were assessed for whether or not they had been on AR at 27-28 weeks. Associations between activity restriction and PTD (<37 weeks) were examined through logistic regression models after adjustment for confounders. RESULTS: There were 1,639 women met inclusion criteria for the lowrisk cohort, of whom 10.8% (n=177) delivered preterm. Within this low risk cohort, 4.9% (n=80) women were recommended activity restriction, with 25.0% (n=20) of those women having a preterm delivery and 16.3% (n=13) having a spontaneous preterm delivery. The associations between activity restriction and preterm delivery are shown below. *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Activity restriction in a low risk cohort was associated with an increased risk of PTD.

Post hoc analysis indicated that our pilot study with 12 subjects per group was powered to detect a 50% difference in HA levels, based on standard \u03b1 = 0.05 and 1-\u03b2 = 0.80 parameters. CONCLUSIONS: In this small cohort of pregnant women, a difference in endocervical HA concentrations was not observed when comparing participants with a short cervix to those with a normal cervical length. These findings lead us to conclude that between 17 and 23 gestational weeks endocervical HA levels are independent of cervix length in women without other risk factors for preterm delivery. The risk of operative delivery (cesarean and assisted vaginal) increases with advancing maternal age. We previously hypothesized that prolonged, cyclical, pre-pregnancy exposure to estrogen and progesterone contributes to uterine ageing (Smith et al, PLoS Med 2008;5:e144). This hypothesis makes 3 predictions: (1) later age at menarche would be associated with a reduced risk of operative delivery, (2) the association would disappear following adjustment for the menarche to birth interval, (3) the risk of operative delivery would increase with longer menarche to birth interval.",

N E Teulings, 2 Y Niu, 1 T Garrud, 1 K L Skeffington, 1 C Beck, 1 N Itani, 1 J B Derks, 2 D A Giussani. Here, we isolated the direct effects of AGT in the chick embryo, the only model in experimental medicine that permits investigation of the effects of therapy on the fetus independent of effects on the maternal and/or placental physiology. METHODS: Fertilized eggs were randomly divided into two groups. Dexamethasone was injected into the egg air cell using a human clinically relevant dose (0.1 mg/kg) on day 14 of the 21 day incubation period. At day 19, the embryos were euthanized. Cardiac function was assessed in isolated hearts under a Langendorff preparation. Second order femoral artery reactivity was studied via in vitro wire myography. A separate cohort of embryos was perfusion fixed (4% paraformaldehyde at 2.66kPa) and cardiac morphology established by unbiased stereology. RESULTS: Dexamethasone treatment restricted relative fetal growth (C: 38.3\u00b10.6, D: 31.9\u00b10.8 %, P<0.05), increased LV end diastolic pressure (LVEDP, Fig.1A ), impaired LV inotropic responses to carbachol (muscarinic agonist) and to isoprenaline (b 1 adrenergic agonist, Fig not yet fully understood, with many clinical and biochemical risk factors associated with idiopathic PTB. It therefore remains difficult to identify the women and babies at risk. Metabolomics, the study of low molecular weight molecules, provides a broad spectrum analysis of biochemical pathways potentially involved in disease manifestation and an unbiased hypothesis generating approach to identify pathophysiological processes. We applied this technology to identify early gestation biomarkers of PTB in maternal serum samples. Prediction of preterm delivery at an early stage of pregnancy, combined with appropriate treatment, could significantly reduce the disease burden on both mother and child. METHODS: A nested case (PTB<37 weeks; n= 56) control (> 37 weeks of gestation; n=112) study was performed on maternal serum samples, from the Irish Cohort of the Screening for Pregnancy Endpoints (SCOPE) biobank, obtained at 15 and 20 weeks' of gestation. PTB samples were matched against two sets of controls; one set was matched for maternal age only and the other for both maternal age and BMI. Samples were analysed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Preliminary analysis showed a significant change in maternal serum metabolite profile at 20 weeks of gestation, but no alterations could be found at 15 weeks. 15 metabolites were significantly increased in PTB cases when compared with controls matched only by age, and 9 when matched by age and BMI (p<0.05; organic acids, amino acids and antioxidants). 7 discriminatory metabolites were common for both sets. False discovery rate ranged from 0.18 to 0.25. CONCLUSIONS: An untargeted metabolomic approach identified an altered metabolite signature in early pregnancy maternal serum related to PTB development. Validation studies will be performed on a separate cohort (New Zealand cohort of the SCOPE biobank). Developing a highthroughput diagnostic tool has the potential to significantly impact both the diagnosis and subsequent treatment of PTB. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between EMG of the rectus abdominis muscles in pregnant women during pushing and the duration of the second stage of labor. METHODS: EMG of the abdominal muscle was recorded during the 2nd stage of labor in 41 untreated (no anesthetic) nulliparous pregnant women.",

Area electrodes probe perpendicular to the skin surface, allowing precise location of the EMG signal within the abdomen. METHODS: Multichannel monopolar EMG recordings were obtained on 10 women in term labor. Three to five electrodes with areas varying between 12 and 300 cm 2 , were placed on the subject's abdomen and monopolar recordings were obtained over 30 minutes. Uterine bioelectrical signals were isolated by filtering with a 0.3 to 2 Hz window. Monopolar channels were subtracted in pairs to yield multiple pseudobipolar tracings. Signal \"fingerprints\" were identified. Data were analyzed by identifying the fingerprints in the pseudo-bipolar tracings, and assigning each bioelectrical burst to an area electrode. RESULTS: Electrodes acted independently when the areas were less than 100 cm 2 . Fingerprints were not be repetitive from contraction to contraction, but the expression of signals arising from each electrode was consistent over several contractions. Bursts occurred both independently from, and simultaneously with, bursts from other electrodes. *Figure(s) will be available online.

DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) and other methylation binding proteins establish and maintain methylation patterns. Ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes initiate DNA demethylation by oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mc) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmc). METHODS: Rats housed in a BPA free environment were fed with either an AIN control or BPA 250\u00b5g/kg diet for a minimum of 20 days, then sacrificed. The ovaries were snap-frozen and stored at -80\u00b0C. Primers were designed for the following genes: Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, TET1, TET2, and TET3. Total RNA was isolated using a mirVana kit (Life Technologies). Reverse transcription was performed using the Smartscribe RT kit (Clontech Laboratories) to generate cDNA template for real-time (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RNA quality was verified with denaturing RNA agarose gel electrophoresis. Quantitative RT PCR was performed using the ViiA\u2122 7 RT PCR System with the Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Life Technologies). Quantification of epigenetic genes was calculated relative to the transcription of housekeeping gene RPL-19 using Microsoft Excel. Gene expression fold differences with p<0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A significant increase in Dnmt1 expression in the BPA exposed group (fold change 14.04, p=0.02) was noted. A trend toward down regulation of all three TET enzymes was also noted, although significance was not achieved. CONCLUSIONS: Increased ovarian expression of Dnmt1 in BPA exposed rats could result in increased methylation, methylation maintenance dysregulation, and down-regulation of key genes necessary for folliculogenesis. A trend toward down regulation of TET enzymes in the exposed group may correlate to the overall inability to de-methylate the maternal genome. Further studies will investigate the BPA effect on global hydroxymethylation as a result of down regulation of TET enzymes. In 10 pregnancies, animals were put down at 138 days.

The average gene expression levels among infants with (n = 15) and without (n = 31) maternal history of smoking during pregnancy were compared, using Student's t test. RESULTS: Expression levels of cytochrome P450 1B1 (p < 0.01) and Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (p = 0.058), inflammatory stress response genes, were increased in babies born to smokers compared to controls. The foreskin samples of infants born to smokers had significantly increased protein-tyrosine phosphatase expression (p < 0.05), a negative regulator of insulin signaling, suggesting an increase in insulin resistance. Altered glucose utilization was also suggested by a significantly increased expression of chemerin (p < 0.01), apolipoprotein D (p < 0.05), cAMP responsive element binding protein 1 (p < 0.05) and significantly decreased expression of the inhibitory protein, fatty acid transporter protein 4 (p < 0.05), suggestive of possible altered fatty acid metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Genes involved in the inflammatory response as well as energy metabolism were deferentially expressed in the foreskins from infants born to smokers compared to nonsmokers. Further studies are warranted to evaluate if these changes will be sustained in the long term through epigenetic interactions. Fetal perirenal adipose tissue (PAT) has characteristics of both white (WAT) and brown (BAT) adipose tissue thus resembling a \"beige\" fat phenotype. We previously reported a significant impact of LTH on PAT gene expression in the late gestation ovine fetus, with increased expression of both BAT and WAT-associated genes. However, by post-natal (PN) day 14, LTH lambs exhibit a decrease in the BAT/beige molecular program while retaining or amplifying genes of the WAT phenotype compared to controls. This suggests a decreased beiging and/or potential loss of beige adipocytes. This study was designed to determine the effect of LTH on miRs that target genes regulating the beige phenotype. We quantified miR155 (repression of PGC1\u03b1) and miR133a and miR346 (repression and activation, respectively of RIP140). PGC1\u03b1 is a key co-activator while RIP140 is a key co-repressor of BAT/beige genes. METHODS: Pregnant ewes were maintained at high altitude (3,820 m, LTH) from ~ 40 days' gestation (dG). Fetuses were delivered on 137-140 dG; additional animals were allowed to deliver and tissue collected from lambs on 12-14 days PN. PAT was analyzed for PGC1\u03b1, RIP140, miR155, miR133a and miR346 by qRT-PCR. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM, in fg mRNA/50 ng RNA for adipose genes and fold change from the housekeeping gene SNORD61 for miRs. RESULTS: Table 1 .",

            "text": "PGC1\u03b1 ( We reported that lambs exhibit a leptin surge on day 6-9 of postnatal life. In rodents, this neonatal leptin surge plays a central role in development of the hypothalamic appetite control centers. Maternal obesity (MO) in the ewe obliterates this leptin peak and also elevates lamb blood CORT. Offspring of MO ewes exhibit increased appetite, weight gain and adiposity to ad lib feeding. Hypothesis: Since CORT alters perinatal adipose tissue development we hypothesized that exogenous CORT administration to normal newborn lambs would raise their plasma CORT to values seen in lambs born to MO ewes, eliminating their leptin peak. METHODS: Newborn male lambs were assigned randomly to the following treatments: One ml i.m. injection of 3 \u00b5g CORT/ kg body weight (CORT3, n=3), 10 \u00b5g CORT/ kg body weight (CORT10, n=3), or vehicle (CON, n=3). Half the original CORT dose or vehicle was administered 24 h later. Two ml jugular blood samples were collected at birth, at 2 h intervals for 12 h, and daily until postnatal day 11 and plasma stored at -80\u00b0C until analyzed for CORT and leptin via validated RIA. Data were analyzed as repeated measures using the Proc Mixed procedure of SAS (SAS Inst. Inc., Cary, NC). RESULTS: Plasma CORT levels of CORT10 animals were elevated (P<0.05) from 2 to 4 h post treatment on day 1 compared to CON animals, while CORT levels of CORT3 lambs were intermediate (Fig.  1A) . Thereafter, CORT in the three groups was similar. Plasma leptin levels were similar across groups through postnatal day 5. Thereafter, plasma leptin in CON animals increased (~2 fold) to peak on days 7-9 before declining on day 11 (Fig. 1B) . CON leptin levels were markedly higher (P<0.01) than CORT10 animals from day 6 through day 11. CORT3 leptin levels were intermediate between CON and CORT10 levels from day 7 through day 11. CONCLUSIONS: These data are consistent with the concept that the markedly elevated blood CORT seen at birth in MO lambs is responsible for the elimination of the early postnatal leptin spike in this species. *Figure(s) will be available online.",

We have shown that perinatal maternal high-fat diet (HFD) programs obesity, hyperleptinemia and central leptin resistance in male rat offspring. Obesity is associated with over activation of the endocannabinoid system (ECS). ECS components are anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (ligands), cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL). Over activation of ECS is associated with leptin resistance. However, it is unknown whether ECS participates in the developmental origins of obesity during gestation and lactation.

Maternal HDF increased CB1 (+52%*) and decreased CB2 (-18%*) in RWAT of only female offspring. Maternal HFD increased both FAAH and MAGL abundance (+90%* and +40%*, respectively) only in male offspring. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal HFD induces early obesity and hyperleptinemia in both male and female rat offspring, with sex-specific changes in the ECS of RWAT. CB1 receptor is involved lipogenesis while CB2 receptor is involved with inflammatory pathways. FAAH and MAGL metabolize endocannabinoids. We speculate that the endocannabinoid system is over activated in both HF male and female offspring through down regulation of CB2 and up regulation of CB1 receptors in females and increased of both MAGL and FAAH in males as adaptive mechanisms. and Type 2 Diabetes. It is well established that estrogenic chemicals interact with the ligand-binding site of estrogen receptors to disrupt transcriptional control of estrogen responsive targets, such as the liver. However, the mechanism by which BPA in utero exerts biological effects on the developing offspring liver has yet to be studied. We hypothesize that short-term prenatal BPA exposure creates lasting effects via developmental programming that alters hepatic gene expression and regulation. METHODS: Twelve pregnant CD-1 mice were continuously treated with BPA (5 mg/kg/day) or vehicle control via osmotic mini pump on days 9-18 of gestation. Six weeks after birth, female offspring were ovariectomized. At eight weeks, female pups were treated with a single IP injection of 300 ng estradiol (E2) or vehicle, and the livers were removed for RNA isolation and analysis. Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array was used to survey the genome-wide expression profile. MatLab was used for bioinformatics and statistical analysis. RESULTS: Of the 24,990 genes on the microarray, 113 genes were significantly altered by a 1.75 fold change in BPA-exposed livers compared to controls (43 genes were significantly upregulated, 70 were significantly downregulated, p<0.05). Many of the genes were found to be involved in hepatic metabolism, including upregulated glucose-6-phosphatase (G6pc) and downregulated sodium-dependent citrate transporter (Slc13a5). Changes in gene expression in BPA-exposed livers versus controls were validated using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). CONCLUSIONS: Significant changes in mRNA expression of genes were observed in the livers of female mice exposed to BPA in utero. Geneenvironment interactions driven by BPA alter the normal developmental programming of the estrogen-responsive liver. Endocrine disruptors can potentially cause lasting changes to hepatic development and subsequent metabolic function, long after chemical exposure has ceased. Since developmental processes required for efficient pulmonary gas transfer are incomplete at birth, the lung and pulmonary circulation are particularly vulnerable. We extend the concept of developmental programming to chronic mountain sickness (CMS), a debilitating syndrome marked by severe polycythemia, hypoventilation, pulmonary hypertension (PHTN) and possible right-heart failure. We hypothesized that perinatal hypoxia impaired ventilatory or pulmonary vascular function and led to CMS later in life.",

Medical records and maternal interviews provided data on perinatal complications.

Network analysis results show that gene networks involved in cell death and survival, cellular development and function, as well as cellular assembly and organization are affected in males, while no specific network was identified in females. CONCLUSIONS: Effects of MNR in pregnancy on signaling pathways related to nutrient sensing and cell proliferation in the late gestation are greater in male than female kidneys.

In this study we aim to investigate whether in vitro embryo culture and transfer, which are manipulations of the nutritional environment during the periconceptional period, result in dysregulation of blood pressure regulation. METHODS: Embryos were either transferred to an intermediate ewe (ET) or cultured in vitro in the absence (IVC) or presence of human serum (IVCHS) and a methyl donor (IVCHS+M) for 6 days.

The relationship between MAP and HR was analysed using the logistic function and the maximal gain was calculated. Two way ANOVA was used to analyse the slope from each curve and delta MAP and HR (at maximal response to PE). RESULTS: Basal MAP and HR did not differ between the treatment groups.

In 16mo males arterial stiffness of small renal and mesenteric arteries was assessed (pressure myography) and blood pressure measured (telemetry). RESULTS: F2 body weights were not different at birth but Restricted males were heavier than Controls at 4-6mo with no differences in organ or adipose weights. Males from Restricted fathers had higher area under glucose curve and reduced first phase insulin secretion at 6mo, which was not sustained to 12mo. There were no changes in pancreatic \u03b2-cell or islet mass. Restricted F2 males had elevated systolic blood pressure at 16mo, which were not driven by changes in left ventricle COL1A2, COL3A1, Tgf\u03b2-1, Tgf\u03b2-2, Smad2, Mmp1a, Mmp2, FGF2 expression or renal and mesenteric arterial stiffening.

Bisphenol A (BPA), which is widely used in plastics (e.g. water bottles) is an endocrine disruptor that is detectable in plasma of pregnant women, fetal plasma and amniotic fluid. Liver plays a central role in the control of lipid metabolism, and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) are the preferred substrates for triglyceride synthesis. We hypothesized that maternal BPA exposure causes upregulation of hepatic stearoyl-CoA desaturase enzyme-1 (SCD-1), which converts saturated fatty acids to MUFA for triglyceride synthesis. METHODS: Female rats had access to filtered drinking water (control group) or drinking water containing BPA (5mg/L; BPA group) two weeks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy and lactation. Standardized litters were nursed by the same dam. At end of nursing period (3 weeks of age), liver tissue was collected from male and female offspring for fatty acid extraction and analysis by GC/MS.

CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data suggest that maternal BPA has sex-specific effects on offspring liver fatty acid metabolism. Increased fatty acid elongation and SCD-1 expression in the presence of unchanged desaturation indices suggest increased utilization of MUFA products to promote triglyceride synthesis in female offspring exposed to BPA perinatally. Among the two primary fat depots, white adipose tissue (WAT) stores excess energy, whereas brown adipose tissue (BAT) expends energy via thermogenesis. Maternal obesity increases the risk of newborn and adult offspring obesity, though it is unclear if this is a physiologic or pathologic mechanism. We hypothesized that maternal obesity programs offspring adipogenesis via specific effects on both newborn WAT and BAT. We determined the proliferation rate and protein expression of distinguishing genes in WAT and BAT in newborn males of control and obese dams. METHODS: Female mice were fed either a control (10% k/cal) or high fat (45% k/cal) diet to create maternal obesity (MO) prior to mating, and diets continued throughout pregnancy and lactation. Newborns were delivered spontaneously, males sacrificed at day one of life, and inguinal WAT and interscapular BAT were collected. Primary WAT and BAT preadipocytes were cultured for proliferation (MTT assay). WAT and BAT protein expression (Western blot) of thermogenic gene (UCP1), adipogenic transcription factors (PPAR\u03b3, C/EBP\u03b1) and mitochondrial marker (ATP5A) were determined. RESULTS: At 1 day of age, MO males were heavier (1.55\u00b10.09 vs 1.31\u00b10.01 g; P<0.05) than Controls. In WAT, MO males exhibited decreased preadipocyte proliferation (0.8-fold; P<0.05) though with increased expression of PPAR\u03b3 (1.3-fold; P<0.05) and C/EBP\u03b1 (1.8fold; P<0.05). Conversely, in BAT, MO preadipocyte proliferation was increased (1.3-fold; P<0.05) as was the expression of UCP-1 (1.5-fold; P<0.05) and ATP5A (1.7-fold; P<0.05).",

These findings suggest a predictiveadaptive response in MO newborns facilitating both acute (BAT) and chronic (WAT) benefits of adiposity. Adipogenic programming effects of MO may have evolved for survival benefit. Perinatal over-or under-nutrition results in obese adult offspring with programmed enhanced adipogenesis. We have shown that increased adiposity in both offspring groups is mediated via early upregulation of adipogenic transcription factor, PPAR\u03a5, which promotes adipocyte differentiation. Induction of PPAR\u03a5 and adipogenesis is regulated by factors including Wnt10b signal transduction. Activation of Wnt10b signaling inhibits adipogenesis through both canonical \u03b2-catenin dependent and non-canonical \u03b2-catenin independent pathways. We hypothesized that inhibition of Wnt10b contributes to increased PPAR\u03a5 and enhanced adipogenesis in offspring exposed to maternal obesity and under-nutrition.

Adipose tissue was obtained at 1 day (inguinal) and 9 months (retroperitoneal) of age from male offspring. Protein expression of Wnt10b and \u03b2-catenin were analyzed. RESULTS: As compared to controls, both HF and FR male newborn PPAR\u03a5 levels were upregulated (2-fold; P<0.05) and Wnt10b was downregulated (0.5, 0.6-fold, respectively; P<0.05). \u03b2-catenin expression was decreased in HF (0.7-fold; P<0.05), though increased in FR newborns (1.4-fold; P<0.05).

Maternal nutrition may lead to changes in young offspring that are predictive of an aging phenotype as suggested by the expression changes in exposed adult and unexposed old animals. Epidemiological data show that urinary levels of the endocrine disrupter chemical bisphenol A (BPA) are associated with hypertension, a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), a major regulator of systemic blood pressure, are expressed in liver (angiotensinogen; AGT) and kidney (renin, angiotensin-converting enzyme; ACE), whereas the major vasopressor effects of angiotensin II are mediated through its receptor type 1 (AT1R) present in kidneys and vasculature. Using a rat model of maternal BPA we have demonstrated hypertension in male, but not female offspring as early as 6 weeks of age. We hypothesized that maternal BPA increases offspring arterial blood pressure via increased expression of RAS components. We determined protein expression of RAS components in liver, kidney and aorta from BPA and control offspring. METHODS: Female rats had access to drinking water (control group) or drinking water containing BPA (5mg/L; BPA group) from two weeks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy and lactation. Standardized litters were nursed by the same dam. At the end of the nursing period (3 weeks of age), liver, kidney and aorta were collected from male offspring. Protein expression of hepatic AGT, renal ACE and aortic AT1R was determined by Western Blot. Protein expression of renin and AT1R in the renal cortex was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Image-Pro software was used to quantify positive area/total area in 4 consecutive sections. RESULTS: At 6 weeks of age, systolic blood pressure was higher in BPA males (148\u00b12 vs 131\u00b13 mmHg; P<0.05) but not females (127\u00b15 vs 128\u00b13 mmHg) compared with controls. At 3 weeks of age, BPA males had lower expression of liver AGT (0.5-fold; P<0.05) and higher expression of renal renin (2-fold; P< 0.01), but not ACE. Both renal cortex and aorta demonstrated greater expression of AT1R (2-fold; 3.5-fold, respectively; P<0.05) in BPA males as compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the data suggest altered expression of components of the classical renin-angiotensin system may contribute to the increased systolic blood pressure in male offspring exposed to BPA during pregnancy and lactation.",

METHODS: NOS3 knockout (KO) and wild type (WT) mice were crossbred to produce heterozygous offspring: maternal-derived (KOM) born to KO mother (hypertensive) and paternal-derived (KOP) born to WT mother (normotensive). KOM and KOP offspring were placed on HFD or control diet (CD) for 4 or 8 wks duration after weaning. KOM-HFD, KOM-CD, KOP-HFD and KOP-CD offspring were obtained. Offspring weight, OGTT and BP were obtained at 12-13 wks of age. 1-way-ANOVA/t-tests were used for statistical analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Offspring on HFD developing in an adverse uterine environment due to maternal HTN are more prone to develop HTN and glucose intolerance compared to their genetically identical counterpart. Maternal HTN is a risk factor for abnormal fetal metabolic programming. High fat intake and timing of its introduction in offspring nutrition play a role in worsening adult hypertension.

INTRODUCTION: The present study tested the hypothesis that estrogen (E 2 ) programs mechanisms in the nonhuman primate fetus that promote insulin sensitivity in offspring after birth. METHODS: An iv glucose tolerance test was performed at 6-12 month intervals (data averaged) between postnatal ages 1 and 3\u00bd years in prepubertal offspring delivered from baboons untreated (n=6) or treated on days 100-165 of gestation (term is 184 days) with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole (0.115 mg/kg BW/day, sc, n=5) which decreased fetal E 2 levels by 95% or letrozole plus E 2 (each 0.115 mg/kg BW/day, n=4). Basal (i.e. non-insulin challenged) levels of insulin receptor (IR) signaling components were quantified by Western immunoblot in skeletal muscle obtained on day 165 of gestation from fetuses of baboons untreated (n=5) or treated with letrozole on days 100-164 (n=5). RESULTS: Peak 1 min blood glucose (210\u00b13 mg/dl) and insulin (113.8\u00b118.7 \u00b5Iu/ml) levels after iv bolus of dextrose were greater (P<0.05) in offspring deprived of E 2 in utero than untreated animals and restored by letrozole + E 2 .

In the 6 months old offspring, oral glucose tolerance test was performed to measure plasma glucose and insulin responses. Rat pancreatic islets were isolated and in vitro cultured for 24 hour to assess insulin secretion.Plasma glucose and insulin responses were calculated using trapezoidal rule. Plasma glucose and insulin responses were expressed as glycemia area under the curve (AUC) (mg/dL*240 minx10 -3 ) and insulin AUC (ng/ml*240 min), respectively. RESULTS: Fasting blood glucose levels were similar; however the fasting insulin levels were significantly increased in both TP males ( Insulin secretion from islets in TP females was not affected. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal testosterone exposure induced glucose intolerance in adult males but not in females. Glucose-induced insulin response was unaffected in males but exaggerated in females. Isolated islets revealed a clear constraint in insulin secretion in prenatal testosterone exposed males. Obesity is strongly linked to low testosterone (T) levels in men. However, how T replacement affects insulin secretion and action in obese men remains unclear. We examined the high fat fed obese rats to determine if castration-induced T deficiency and T replacement affect metabolic functions including glucose and insulin tolerance, pancreatic insulin secretion and adiposity. METHODS: Three month old male SD rats were divided into 3 groups: control, castrated (for T deficiency) and castrated with T replacement (subcutaneous 100 mg T pellets, 90 day release). All rats were fed with 45 kcal % high fat diet. Ten weeks later, all rats were assessed for glucose and insulin tolerance, feed intake, body weight and fat distribution. Pancreatic islets were isolated and cultured for 24 hour to assess insulin secretion. Plasma glucose and insulin responses were expressed as glycemia area under the curve (AUC) (mg/dl*240 min x10 -3 ) and insulin AUC (ng/ ml*240 min), respectively. RESULTS: Fasting insulin and glucose levels were significantly lower in castrated rats (insulin: 0.42\u00b10.05 ng/ml; glucose: 114\u00b13.69 mg/ dl) and T replacement increased insulin (0.82\u00b10.28 ng/ml) to controls levels (0.75\u00b10.23 ng/ml) but did not reverse glucose levels (112\u00b14.5 vs 129\u00b16.05 mg/dl in controls). Glucose tolerance was similar in castrated rats (glycemia AUC: 0.49\u00b10.05, Insulin AUC: 5.6\u00b10.8) and controls (glycemia AUC: 0.44\u00b10.05, Insulin AUC: 7.9\u00b11.3) but T replacement induced significant glucose intolerance with elevated glucose (glycemia AUC: 0.68\u00b10.07) and impaired insulin responses (Insulin AUC: 5.83\u00b10.4). Whole body insulin sensitivity was not different between groups, however insulin secretion from isolated islets were significantly impaired in T replaced rats (0.71\u00b10.1 ng/ml) compared to castrated (2.30\u00b10.5 ng/ ml) and control rats (2.81\u00b10.1 ng/ml). T replaced animals weighed significantly smaller (595\u00b115.1 g) than controls (815\u00b133.8 g) and castrated rats (647.4\u00b123.9 g). T replacement significantly decreased the amount of peritoneal fat (14.27\u00b10.83 g) and subcutaneous fat (12.69\u00b11.24 g) compared to controls (peritoneal: 40.94\u00b12.34 g; subcutaneous, 26.13\u00b12.36 g) and castrated rats (peritoneal: 32.06\u00b12.67 g; subcutaneous: 31.42\u00b13.02 g). Feed intake was not different between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Replacement of T in high fat diet fed obese rats decreases adiposity but induces glucose intolerance and inhibits pancreatic insulin secretion.",

Select control (n=20) and MNR (n=25) fetuses underwent full necropsy, with brain to liver weight ratios increased 48%, blood glucose values decreased 28%, and Hb values increased 9% in MNR fetuses. In these fetuses, HP-1 levels were increased 158% and 117% in the kidney and liver, respectively, while there was no significant change in the placenta. CONCLUSIONS: MNR in guinea pigs results in FGR with placentas that are large relative to body weight and likely a reactive process to nutrient deficiency, and livers that are small relative to body weight and likely reflecting a degree of blood flow redistribution; changes which are also characteristic of the asymmetrical FGR observed in association with \"placental insufficiency\". These fetuses also have HP-1 levels which are substantially higher in the kidney and liver and along with the higher EPO and Hb values we have previously reported, further implicate chronic hypoxia in these animals as an additional mediator for growth restriction and altered development. INTRODUCTION: MNR prior to and during gestation in guinea pigs results in fetuses which display evidence of chronic hypoxia in association with fetal growth restriction (FGR). An impact of decreased oxygen availability during fetal development is increased oxidative stress which could act as a further mediator of altered growth and development. We postulated in association with FGR, MNR fetuses would display impaired anti-oxidant capacity and markers of oxidative stress near term. METHODS: Guinea pig sows were fed ad libitum (Control) or 70% of the control diet pre-pregnant switching to 90% at mid-pregnancy (MNR). Animals were necropsied near term for fetal-placental growth measures and blood metabolites. Oxidized and reduced glutathione (GSSG/GSH) and peroxiredoxin (PRDX) protein levels as measures of anti-oxidant capacity, and malondialdehyde (MDA) as a measure of lipid peroxidation and thereby oxidative stress were assessed in the fetal liver and placenta.",

Select control (n=20) and MNR (n=25) fetuses underwent full necropsy with MNR-FGR animals showing GSSG/GSH ratios that were decreased by 56 and 107% in the liver and placenta, respectively, indicating increased conversion of glutathione to its reduced form as seen with scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS). PRDX protein levels increased 143% in the fetal liver indicating a reactive compensatory increase in anti-oxidant capacity, although there were no changes in the placenta. Surprisingly, MNR-FGR MDA levels decreased 42 and 32% in the liver and placenta, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: MNR prior to and continuing through pregnancy in guinea pigs results in FGR animals with altered anti-oxidant capacity likely in response to an increase in ROS. This provides evidence that MNR, resulting in chronic fetal hypoxia, triggers an oxidative stress response during gestation. While we found no evidence of ROS lipid peroxidation, this may reflect the impact of nutritional impairment on lipid levels and turnover. Thus, it is probable that other cellular processes are interfered with thereby contributing to longer term adverse development. Little is known about the impact of growth discordance on TTTS outcome. The aim of this study was to determine the association between growth discordance and adverse perinatal outcomes in TTTS pregnancies.",

Exclusion criteria include triplets, significant congenital malformation and chromosomal abnormalities. Growth discordance was defined as estimated fetal weights >20% different when compared to the larger twin. Outcomes considered were stillbirth, preterm delivery <34 weeks, <32 weeks and <28 weeks. Data were stratified into concordant group with <20% discordance and discordant group with >20% discordance. Data was analyzed using Chisquare or T-test as appropriate. RESULTS: 439 patients met our inclusion criteria. There was no significant difference in base line demographics among concordant and discordant TTTS (Table) . Donor twins in the discordant group when compared to the concordant group had elevated head circumference/ abdominal circumference (HC/AC), lower birth weight, higher rate of selective growth restriction (49% vs. 14%, p<0.001) and lower survival rate (73% vs. 83%, p=0.036).

Future studies will focus on further characterizing and quantifying HIFU induced tissue changes. Previous studies demonstrated that female offspring were resistant to fetal stress-induced programming of ischemic-sensitive phenotype in the heart. Yet, the mechanisms remain unknown. The present study tested the hypothesis that estrogen plays a role in protecting females in fetal programming of heart vulnerability. METHODS: Pregnant rats were divided into normoxic and hypoxic (10.5% O 2 from day 15 to 21 of gestation) groups. Ovariectomy (OVX) and estrogen (E2) replacement were performed in 8-week-old female offspring. Hearts of 4-month-old females were subjected to ischemia and reperfusion injury in a Langendorff preparation. RESULTS: OVX significantly decreased post-ischemic recovery of left ventricular function and increased myocardial infarction. No difference was observed between normoxic and hypoxic groups. The effect of OVX was rescued by E2 replacement. OVX decreased the binding of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) at angiotensin II type 1 (AT1R) and type 2 (AT2R) receptor promoters, resulting in a decrease in AT1R and an increase in AT2R in the heart. Additionally, OVX decreased estrogen receptor (ER) expression in the heart and inhibited ER/GR interaction in binding to GREs at ATR promoters. Consistent with the changes in angiotensin II receptors, OVX significantly decreased PKC\u03b5 and phospho-PKC\u03b5 abundance in the heart. These OVX-induced changes were abrogated by the E2 replacement.",

INTRODUCTION: ACOG recommends that obstetricians' prenatal genetic screening discussions include mention of the false positive rates, advantages, disadvantages and limitations of screening, and the availability of diagnostic testing. We examined discussions of prenatal genetic screening to assess how obstetricians currently counsel and how this counseling impacts patients' screening acceptance. METHODS: Transcripts from audio recordings of 200 first prenatal visits were coded using an iterative process to determine compliance with ACOG recommendations and to categorize discussion elements. Chi-squared, t-tests and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to determine the impact of demographic factors and discussion codes on women's decisions to pursue genetic screening or diagnostic testing. RESULTS: Providers offered genetic screening at 91.5% of visits. 71% of patients underwent genetic screening. Patients offered screening were significantly more likely to undergo screening than patients who were not offered screening (p<0.001). Few providers (1.5%) mentioned all of the ACOG recommended topics during the screening discussion. Inclusion of more of the ACOG recommended topics increased patient acceptance of screening (p=0.04). While discussion of the advantages of genetic screening increased screening acceptance (p=0.003), discussion of the disadvantages and limitations did not. Conversations varied from brief mention of available tests to explanations of the a woman's baseline risk of Down Syndrome, the types of genetic abnormalities assessed by screening, the screening process, the type of result obtained and options for diagnostic testing. Only 38.8% of the conversations included discussions of what a positive result from genetic screening meant and how a patient might use this information. CONCLUSIONS: Although the majority of patients were offered and underwent screening, most providers did not sufficiently explain the implications of screening to the patients. While this did not appear to impact patient acceptance of screening, it is uncertain that patients have a clear understanding of what additional stress and burden they may face if they receive positive or indeterminate testing results.",

RESULTS: Microarray analyses revealed upregulation of Usp16 mRNA expression in trisomy 21 (T21) placentas as compared to euploid controls (> 2 fold). Immunolocalization of Usp 16 showed that T21 was associated with highly upregulated expression of this molecule in the stromal cores of chorionic villi and in trophoblast cell columns that anchor the fetalplacental unit to the uterine wall.

CONCLUSIONS: Inadequate formation and function of the placenta are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Our findings showed altered expression of Usp 16 in Down syndrome placentas at the level of the villous stroma and cell columns.

Current testing modalities for noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) are limited to 10 weeks gestational age (GA) and do not provide an intact fetal genome. Up to 2000 extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells can be isolated non-invasively by TRIC as early as 5 weeks GA. It has been suggested that EVT cells exhibit a high degree of mosaicism. EVT cells obtained by TRIC were evaluated for mosaicism to determine whether TRIC can be used for NIPT. METHODS: Endocervical specimens were obtained from pregnant patients between 5 and 20 weeks GA for isolation of EVT cells by TRIC. Briefly, HLA-G positive EVT cells were separated from maternal cervical cells using a column-free, immunomagnetic nanoparticle separation procedure. Approximately 50 isolated EVT or maternal cells were spun onto slides and evaluated by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with probes for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y (Aneuvysion, Abbott). Medical records were reviewed to select pregnancies with male fetuses lacking evidence of aneuploidy. Purity of the trophoblast specimens were determined by \u03b2HCG staining and percentage of cells staining for Y chromosome. Trophoblast retrieval and isolation from the cervix (TRIC) could provide an alternative approach for early non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) with cell free fetal DNA. Trophoblast cells have been retrieved from the cervix of pregnant patients as early as 5 weeks gestation and have been used to identify fetal gender. NIPT is negatively impacted in patients with a high body mass index (BMI) and early gestational age (GA). Prior to employing TRIC for prenatal testing, it is important to assess whether it is impacted by BMI, maternal age, parity, or GA. METHODS: Cervical specimens were obtained using a ThinPrep kit and cytobrush on 63 pregnant patients from 5 weeks 2 days to 20 weeks 3 days GA. Trophoblast cells were isolated with anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G antibody coupled to magnetic nanoparticles. Purity of the isolated trophoblast cells was assessed by staining for \u03b2 human chorionic gonadotropin. Trophoblast yield was recorded for each patient. Using Pearson's correlation, relationship between BMI, parity, maternal age, and gestational age to trophoblast yield was evaluated. RESULTS: Average GA of the specimens was 12.8 weeks \u00b1 4.27, average trophoblast yield was 647 \u00b1 485, average parity was 1.22 \u00b1 1.37, average age was 27.3 \u00b1 5.6, and average trophoblast purity was 94.6% \u00b1 5.57%. Statistical analysis revealed non-significant Pearson's correlation coefficients for comparisons between trophoblast yield and BMI (r= 0.12, P=0.35), maternal age (r= 0.13, P=.31), parity(r= 0.06, 0.64), or GA (r= -0.09, P=.48). Subanalysis comparing trophoblast yield between nulliparous and multiparous patients revealed no significant differences by an independent t test (p= 0.14). CONCLUSIONS: Trophoblast cells can be isolated from the endocervical canal of ongoing pregnancies with a high degree of purity. Unlike NIPT, acquisition of fetal DNA by TRIC is not negatively affected by early GA or elevated BMI. Additionally, parity and maternal age do not effect recovery. TRIC could provide a highly reliable platform for early, NIPT that is unaffected by BMI and GA between 5 and 20 weeks GA. . Objective criteria of VD were met in 42/60 (70%). Correlation between ventricular ratios and neonatal findings was tested overall and for each cardiac anomaly group. In none of these combinations did the objective criteria improve prediction of neonatal problems or of normal NE. CONCLUSIONS: Subjective VD, regardless of the objective measurement, is associated with cardiac defects as well as other adverse outcomes. A policy of follow-up FE appears justified based on the frequency and required perinatal management of associated cardiac and other abnormalities.",

            "text": "A retrospective study of microcystic CPAM cases from two tertiary care academic medical centers over a 10-year period. Subject demographics, antenatal imaging studies, obstetric and neonatal outcomes were abstracted from the medical record. CPAM volumes were normalized to their initial size at diagnosis and the growth trajectory modeled using a non-linear fit to estimate population characteristics. Descriptive statistics and non-parametric analysis (Mann-Whitney test) was performed. RESULTS: Of 21 cases of microcystic CPAM identified during the study period, 20 cases had a CPAM volume-to-head ratio (CVR) <1.6. Mean gestational age at diagnosis was 22.3 weeks (range 17.9-30.2 weeks). Growth trajectory of this CPAM cohort was best fit by the second order equation Y=91.05 + 5.94X-0.05X 2 . Maximal CPAM size was reached about 60 days after diagnosis, followed by regression, often close to the initial volume. All cases were born at term, and exposure to antenatal corticosteroids did not significantly impact CPAM growth trajectory (p=0.9) or CVR at delivery (p=0.2). Five fetuses had associated extrapulmonary anomalies (primarily cardiac defects) that were the only predictive factors for NICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: Microcystic CPAMs with CVR<1.6 exhibit a generalizable growth trajectory with a peak in volume followed by regression. Perinatal outcomes are most influenced by the presence of associated congenital anomalies. Decreased frequency of sonographic surveillance may be acceptable for microcystic CPAMs and should exclude associated congenital anomalies. CMA was more often discussed with women who primarily spoke English (p<0.001), self-identified as white (p=0.004), and did not receive prenatal care in a health center (p<0.001). There were no differences in CMA uptake by race/ethnicity, language, insurance or provider type. Multiparous women were less likely to accept CMA than nulliparas (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.1-0.9). CONCLUSIONS: Women who undergo invasive fetal testing are more likely to undergo CMA if the indication for invasive testing is a fetal structural anomaly. There may be important demographic differences in women who are offered CMA compared to those who are not offered this test. These disparities bear further exploration. We now offer surgical intervention fetal ONTD diagnosed in the mid-trimester, as is has been shown toimprove outcomes. Traditionally, 2nd trimester maternal serum alpha feto-protein (MSAFP) and sonographic surveyhas been used to screen for detection of ONTD. As we continue to make strides in early aneuploidy screening,MSAFP levels may not be obtained routinely. The aim of this study was to employ a large contemporary pediatricneurosurgical referral center database of confirmed cases to determine the antenatal rate and means of ONTDdetection. METHODS: Using a retrospective study design, we generated a database of all repaired ONTDs (n=107) from July2007-February 2013. Detailed antenatal data was abstracted from the maternal record and in direct patient interview,and rates of detection for each modality of screening were determined. ORs were calculated to assess the relativediagnostic reliability of each screening modality. RESULTS: Of the 107 total cases 10.3% (11/107) were not detected antenatally and alternately found at the time ofdelivery. Consistent with prior findings, the OR for ultrasound-based detection of ONTD was 5.9 (95% CI 2.2-15.5).However, this was largely due to ubiquitous use of sonogram as 90.9% (10 of 11) of antenatal missed diagnoses hadprenatal care, and 80% (8 of 10) had documented \"optimal\" ultrasounds. In contrast, only a single missed case ofONTD had a false-negative MSAFP. Missed detection by ultrasound was likely not secondary to limited visualization,as the mean BMI was not significantly different (27.84 kg/ m2 vs 27.76 kg/m2). CONCLUSIONS: Following the MOMS trial, any ONTD that goes undiagnosed prenatally is a missed opportunity forintervention. We have observed that 10.3% of ONTD in our regional referral center were not detected antenatally andhad a lower utilization of MSAFP screening. We speculate that optimal detection requires the historically advocatedtwofold approach of mid-trimester MSAFP with sonographic screening. Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is characterized by withdrawal symptoms in a neonate who was exposed to drugs in utero. Buprenorphine dose does not correlate with NAS severity. The purpose of this study was to determine if metabolic differences play a role in NAS following buprenorphine treatment during pregnancy using two CYP450 SNPs. METHODS: Cord blood from MARC patients was collected at birth. Buprenorphine and norburprenorphine levels were quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Cord blood DNA was extracted and quantified. SNP analysis was performed using PCR. An allelic discrimination was performed to determine the genotype of the SNPs rs28451617 and rs2740574. These were analyzed for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) using Chi-squared with two degrees of freedom. Expected genotypic frequencies were compared with those observed using Chi-squared with one degree of freedom and a desired P-value of 0.05. NAS was evaluated using Finnegan scoring. RESULTS: Genotyping of SNP rs28451716 (CYP3A7*1E) were all homozygous for the major allele. Six samples were heterozygous for the minor allele CYP3A4*1B (6.8%). This SNP was in HWE within our study population with a Chi-squared value of 0.23 and a p-value of 0.888. There was a significant difference between the observed and expected genotypic frequencies with a p-value of 0.03. ANOVA showed no correlation between NAS score or length of NICU stay. CONCLUSIONS: The CYP3A4 SNP had an increased allele frequency in the study population (6.8% versus 2.5%) with a significant difference between the observed and expected genotypic frequencies, indicating a possible enrichment. This population may have increased levels of buprenorphine compared to the general population due to decreased CYP3A4 metabolism of buprenorphine to norbuprenorphine. Increased buprenorphine levels may predispose those with the CYP3A4 SNP to drug abuse or even addiction due to increased nociceptive binding compared to those with normal buprenorphine metabolism. A correlation between NAS score or length of NICU stay was not observed.",

Inflammation is associated with depression in non-pregnant populations, with normal pregnancy, and with pregnancy morbidities such as gestational diabetes, obesity, preeclampsia and preterm birth. Studies have suggested an association of inflammatory markers TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 with peripartum depressive symptoms. In the present study, we hypothesized that women with self-reported depressive symptoms may exhibit elevated serum inflammatory markers, including TNF\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and CRP, supporting a role for inflammation in peripartum depression. METHODS: Sixty-three healthy gravidas were recruited at an academic medical center in their third trimester. At baseline and follow-up at 3 and 6 months postpartum, participants completed a demographics survey, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and provided serum samples. Collected demographics included pre-pregnancy BMI, ethnicity, education level, smoking status, employment, sources of income, and socioeconomic factors. Key serum inflammatory makers were quantified by Luminex multiplex array at baseline, and at follow-up 3 and 6 months postpartum. Multiple linear mixed effects were used to model longitudinal trends of biomarkers with the EPDS score, throughout the third trimester and the postpartum period. RESULTS: Elevated serum TNF\u03b1 was associated with a lower EPDS total score (\u03b2=-0.90, p=0.046) after adjusting for demographic factors and medication use. In contrast, IL-6, CRP and IL-1\u03b2 did not demonstrate statistically significant associations with depression or anxiety symptoms as quantified by the EPDS in either crude or adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS: Increased inflammatory markers have been associated with depressive symptoms in non-pregnant and postpartum populations. Contrary to our hypotheses, we report that elevated serum levels of TNF\u03b1 are associated with lower self-reported depression during the peripartum period. Relevant literature evaluating a role for inflammation in depression in the unique context of pregnancy is both limited and inconsistent, therefore further exploration and understanding is merited. The early 2 nd trimester is a key stage of pregnancy that includes the 2 nd wave of trophoblast invasion. Insufficient invasion is involved in the pathogenesis of disorders such as pre-eclampsia. Perturbations of the normal metabolic trajectory may predict poor outcomes. Analysis of the metabolome at this stage of pregnancy is increasingly being used for biomarker identification. METHODS: Plasma samples and detailed clinical metadata were collected at 12, 16 and 20 weeks from pregnant women from a mixed ethnic background who experienced a normal term delivery (n=359). 1 H-NMR spectra were acquired for samples using standard 1D and 2D pulse sequences. Spectra were processed, calibrated to TSP and analysed using multivariate approaches. Metabolites of interest were identified using a Bruker NMR Metabolic Profiling Database and in-house and public databases.",

Exposure to MO at conception and during pregnancy leads to excessive OFF weight and adiposity. We hypothesized that maternal biochemical parameters at breeding correlate positively with OFF metabolism. METHODS: F0 female Wistar rats ate control or obesogenic diet from weaning through lactation. Half of each group wheel ran 30 min/day, 5 times/week from 90 d through pregnancy beginning (120 d) providing four groups (n=8/ group): control (C), obese (MO), exercised controls (CEx), and exercised obese (MOEx). At breeding serum insulin and leptin were measured. After weaning F1 OFF ate C diet. At day 110 d OFF (n= 8 of each sex from different litter) serum insulin and triglycerides (TG) were measured. Pearson correlations were done between maternal and male and female OFF parameters. RESULTS: Maternal serum insulin and leptin at breeding correlate positively (p<0.001) with male and female OFF TG (Fig 1B r=0 .9, D r=0.8, F r=0.7, H r=0.7) and with male OFF insulin ( Fig 1A r=0 .7, C r=0.6) but not female ( Fig 1E r=0. 2, G r=0.2). *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal biochemical markers can predict OFF metabolic parameters. A strength of this study is the heterogeneity of the starting points in the four groups at breeding -normal or MO and with or without exercise. Despite this heterogeneity some markers correlated very well. This approach will provide insights into which markers are most useful. In addition it is clear that MO negatively programs offspring metabolic phenotype in a sex specific manner. CONACyT 155166. Our objective was to determine the regulation of vitamin D in long-term hypoxic sheep. METHODS: Normoxic and long-term (~140 days)-hypoxic Western sheep were studied near term. Control non-pregnant normoxic and longterm hypoxic sheep were also studied. 25-hydroxy and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D metabolites were analyzed in maternal and fetal plasma using ELISA. CYP24a1 (degrading enzyme), CYP27b1 (activating enzyme), and vitamin D receptor (VDR) mRNA and protein levels were studied by real-time PCR and immunoblotting. CYP24a1 promoter methylation was studied by bisulfite sequencing. RESULTS: Pregnancy was associated with a significant increase in both 25-hydroxy vitamin D and the active metabolite 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D, compared to non-pregnancy. Fetal levels of the bioactive metabolite were 3-4 fold higher than maternal levels. Hypoxic sheep had more than double the levels of the stable precursor 25-hydroxy-vitamin D and ~90% higher levels of the bioactive metabolite than normoxic sheep. The changes in vitamin D status were partly due to pregnancy induced upregulation of renal CYP27b1 and downregulation of CYP24a1. Placental (cotyledon) downregulation of CYP24a1 was associated with promoter methylation. Hypoxia was also associated with increased maternal liver levels of CYP2R1 that regulates 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. CONCLUSIONS: Western sheep experience similar increases in vitamin D as reported for pregnant women. Long-term hypoxia further increased vitamin D levels by upregulating renal CYP27b1, liver CYP2R1 and methylation induced downregulation of placental CYP24a1.

Data collected included: maternal demographics, known risk factors for MI, laboratory tests, and cardiac evaluation (EKG, Echo, coronary angiography and cardiac catherization findings), and maternal outcomes. RESULTS: 14 patients underwent coronary angiography for evaluation of a suspected MI: 10 (71%) had angiography proven MI. Four (40%) of which occurred before delivery and 60% were in the postpartum period. Mean maternal age was 36.7 years (Range: 35-41). Table1 summarizes known risk factors, symptoms and cardiac findings in these 10 patients. All 10 women had advanced maternal age plus at least 2 known recognized risk factors for MI.

This suggests induction of the fetal brain sparing reflex, expressed as an increase in the ratio of carotid to femoral blood flow ratio (CBF:FBF, Fig.1C ). Fetal brain oxygen and glucose delivery was maintained by this response (Fig.1D ,E). *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Uterine manipulation during surgery represents an insult which requires fetal haemodynamic compensation. These data should be considered when planning elective surgery in pregnant women.",

Nocturnal dipper status was also significantly different between pregnancies complicated with PE and those that were not: MAP 3/9 vs 9/10 (p=0.02) and DBP 5/9 vs 10/10 respectively (p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences in the diurnal BP variation were observed in women who developed PE compared to those who did not. The absence of a nocturnal dip and higher nocturnal MAP levels <20weeks gestation might be a useful adjuvant test to identify women at increased risk of PE. RESULTS: 1) CGRP, AM, IMD and BK produced dose-dependent relaxation of OA from both NP and P women; 2) Responses (Emax) to CGRP were significantly enhanced in pregnant (56.5 +/-1.8) compared to NP women (30.3 +/-5.1); 3) Vasodilatory responses to IMD were also significantly enhanced in P (48 +/-2.6) compared to NP women (30.1+/-4.8); 4) No significant differences were observed in responses to AM and BK between two groups; 5) CRLR and RAMP1, 2, and 3 are localized to smooth muscle cells, with increased density for all of them in P compared to NP women; and 6)mRNA for CRLR, RAMP2 and 3 are increased in OA from P compared to NP. CONCLUSIONS: CGRP family peptides relax human omental arteries and these vasodilatory responses are increased during pregnancy. The relaxation actions are mediated via enhanced expression of their receptors in the smooth muscle cells. These data suggest vascular adaptions during pregnancy could involve CGRP family peptides. (IUGR) is a condition of placental etiology and associated with increased risk for the long-term development of cardiovascular disease in the mother. However, it is still unclear if IUGR patients exhibit global diastolic dysfunction during pregnancy. The aim of this study is to assess the vasodilatory responses of omental arteries from normal and normotensive IUGR pregnancies to calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) and its family members adrenomedullin (AM) and intermedin (IMD), and assess expression of CGRP family peptide receptor components, calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR), and receptor activity modifying proteins (RAMP 1, 2 and 3) . METHODS: Omental arteries (OA), collected during caesarian section from women with normal pregnancy (n=9) and normotensive IUGR (n=3) were cleaned, cut into rings and mounted on a wire myograph for isometric tension recording. Rings were pre-contracted with U46619 (1\u00b5M), and cumulative dose-response relaxation curves were constructed for CGRP, AM, IMD (0.1nM-100nM), and bradykinin (BK, 0.1nM -1\u00b5M) as percent inhibition of U46619 induced contraction. QPCR and immunofluorescence localizations were used to measure mRNA and proteins for receptor components in OA. RESULTS: Both CGRP and BK induced OA relaxation responses are similar in women with normal and IUGR pregnancies. However, maximal responses (Emax) were significantly (P<0.05) lower in IUGR compared to normal pregnancies for both AM (18.2 +/-6.7 vs 38 +/-2.5) and IMD (26.9 +/-6.7 vs 48 +/-2.6). CRLR, RAMP1, 2 and 3 are localized to smooth muscle cells in OA. mRNA levels for RAMP1 and 3 are decreased, CRLR are increased and RAMP 2 are unchanged in IUGR, compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: IUGR did not alter relaxation of OA to CGRP and BK, but led to decreased responses to AM and IMD, implying impaired specific receptor components in vascular smooth muscle in normotensive IUGR without affecting endothelial functions. Reduced OA vasodilatory responses to AM and IMD may implicate similar mechanisms in other vascular beds and thus reduce blood flow to fetus in IUGR. Further studies are needed to clarify the potential nature of long-term cardiovascular risk that may arise due to impaired AM and IMD responses in these women. Exercise increases transmembrane glucose transporter expression in liver and skeletal muscle leading to improved glucose homeostasis. While exercise is encouraged to promote a healthy lifestyle, the effect of exercise during pregnancy on modulating fetal programming remains poorly understood. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of exercise on glucose transporter (GLUT) 1, 2, and 4 gene expression during pregnancy in mice. METHODS: Eleven-week-old female ICR mice were split into exercise and sedentary cohorts. Exercise mice were housed in cages with voluntary access to a running wheel for 1 week prior to mating and throughout pregnancy. Mating was timed such that the effects of exercise during pregnancy could be evaluated at a specific gestational age. Body composition was measured on gestational day 16, and maternal tissue and serum samples were collected for in vitro analyses on gestational day 18. RNA was isolated from maternal liver, gastrocnemius muscle, retroperitoneal fat, placenta, and fetal liver (n = 8 per group for each tissue). RNA expression levels were quantified using the NanoString Technologies nCounter system and normalized to housekeeping genes. The average gene expression level was compared among sedentary and exercise groups, using Student's t test. RESULTS: Exercising mice showed significantly improved body composition with increased lean mass (p = 0.003) and decreased fat percentage (p < 0.001). They also had significantly reduced serum leptin (p = 0.002) levels. Maternal voluntary exercise had differential effects on regulation of transmembrane glucose transporters, based on tissue of origin. Maternal exercise significantly upregulated GLUT4 in the fetal liver (p = 0.008), while GLUT1 was significantly upregulated in the maternal liver (p = 0.028). Likewise, GLUT 2 was significantly upregulated in the placenta (p = 0.017), but downregulated in the maternal liver (p = 0.011). There were no significant differences in the GLUT expression in fat or skeletal muscle. CONCLUSIONS: Voluntary exercise during pregnancy can significantly alter GLUT gene expression; protein levels and translocation must be measured to further elucidate possible effects. Further studies are warranted to explore the effect of maternal exercise on epigenetic changes in the offspring.",

The OA rings mounted on a wire myograph system for isometric tension recording, were pre-contracted with U46619 (1\u00b5M), and cumulative dose-response curves were constructed for CGRP, AM and IMD (0.1nM -100nM), and bradykinin (BK, 0.1nM -1\u00b5M) with or without specific blockers of relaxation pathways, added 30 minutes prior to peptide additions to muscle bath. The relaxation responses were calculated as percent inhibition of the U46619 induced contraction, and compared before and after incubations with blockers. RESULTS: 1) CGRP, AM, IMD and BK produced dose-dependent relaxation of human OA obtained from pregnant women; 2) Vasodilatory responses to CGRP are reduced by nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME (0.1mM), adenylyl cyclase inhibitor SQ22536 (10 nM), calcium-dependent potassium channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA, 10mM), and ATP sensitive potassium channel blocker glybenclamide (10 \u00b5M); 3) The cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (10\u00b5M) partially inhibited the concentration-response curve to CGRP, and combination of L-NAME and indomethacin plus non-selective K+ channel blocker tetrabutylammonium (TBA, 1mM) completely abolished CGRP-induced relaxation; 4) Vasodilatory responses to AM were also reduced by L-NAME SQ22536, and TEA, but not by glybenclamide; 5) Vasodilatory responses to IMD were reduced by L-NAME and SQ22536 as well, but not by TEA and glybenclamide. CONCLUSIONS: CGRP family peptides relax human omental arteries from pregnant women. The relaxation actions of these different peptides, CGRP, AM and IMD, were differentially mediated via multiple mechanisms, involving nitric oxide, cyclic AMP, cyclo-oxygenase derived prostanoids, and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors. In late pregnancy, catabolism is predominant in nutrient metabolism and the stored nutrients in the mother are mobilized to support rapid fetal growth. Protein and amino acids are critical for fetal growth and development. Our previous study showed that in mid-and late pregnancy, plasma levels of total amino acids remained stable in pregnant rats fed a low protein (LP) diet, coincident with reduced plasma levels of essential amino acids and elevated non-essential amino acids. In this study we hypothesized that protein degradation in skeletal muscles is enhanced to maintain the homostasis of amino acids in pregnant rats fed LP diet. METHODS: Time-scheduled pregnant SD rats were fed a normal (control; CT) or LP from Day 3 of pregnancy until sacrificed at Days 10, 19 and 22 (n=6-10 rats/diet/day). Gastrocnemius muscle (GM) was collected for RNA and protein extraction. Expression of Fbxo32, Trim63 (protein degradation marker), Ccnd1 (skeletal muscle cell proliferation marker), Myod1, Ckdn1 (differentiation marker) and R18s (housekeeping gene) were analyzed by qPCR. The abundance of total and phosphorylated mTOR and AKT (key enzymes in protein synthesis), NDUFB8, SDHB, UACRC2, MTCO1 and ATP5A (key enzymes in oxidative phosphorylation) and beta-actin (loading control) in GM was analyzed by Western blotting.

INTRODUCTION: HELLP syndrome is regarded as a subset of preeclampsia characterized by hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count. We examined regional cerebral blood flow differences using MRI comparing women with a history of non-HELLP preeclampsia (PRE) with women with a history of HELLP syndrome prior to and during subsequent pregnancies to examine the brain hemodynamic adaptations. METHODS: Paired pre-pregnancy (PP) and third trimester (3P) MRI data from 6 PRE and 6 HELLP were acquired using a Philips Achieva 3T MRI. Regional cerebral blood flow was measured using pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling in 5 brain regions. INTRODUCTION: This present study was performed to determine the involvement of the nitric oxide (NO) signalling pathway in the increased susceptibility to infection thought to occur in pregnancy. Previously we reported that NO levels were attenuated in pregnant animals in endotoxaemia compared to non-pregnant (NP) controls. When taken with the hypotensive response observed, these data suggested an increased sensitisation to the vasodilator action of NO. We aimed to further explore both vascular function in pregnancy and the roles of DDAH1, an endogenous inhibitor of ADMA, and NO in pregnancy using DDAH1 knockout (DDAH1 -/-) mice. METHODS: Vessel function and sensitivity to vasoactive substances were assessed by wire myography in aorta and uterine artery. Pregnant (E16) or NP CD1 mice received either vehicle (PBS) or LPS (10\u00b5g 0111:B4) i.p. 12 hours before culling. Female DDAH1 -/mice or wildtype littermates (WT) were implanted with PA-C10 radio-telemetry device into the aorta. NP baseline recordings were taken for 48h. Mice were then timed-mated and recordings were resumed at E0 until labour. Further cohorts of mice were used for tissue harvest at 6 and 12 hours post LPS or vehicle i.p.",

Conversely, there appeared to be a reduced response to the vasoconstrictor action of phenylephrine. In pregnant mice, cGMP levels were increased compared to NP controls. LPS did not cause any further increase. In female DDAH1 -/mice, NP baseline MAP was significantly increased compared to WT controls (116\u00b12.8 mmHg and 108.6\u00b10.9 mmHg respectively, P<0.05). This increase was not maintained throughout pregnancy; however MAP remained high in early pregnancy (E4-E7) and increased again dramatically after labour. ADMA was increased in pregnant DDAH1 -/compared to WT controls but circulating NO was not significantly altered. CONCLUSIONS: As the effects of NO are primarily mediated by cGMP, increased levels of cGMP may have conferred increased sensitivity; however we did not see any evidence to support this. Furthermore, it may be that the hypotensive response to LPS in pregnancy is mediated through decreased sensitivity to vasoconstrictors. Overriding factors drive the decrease in MAP during pregnancy in DDAH1 -/mice. ",

Circulating estrogens are significantly elevated to stimulate uterine vascular development and to prepare for embryo implantation during the menstrual cycle. The objective of this study is to test a hypothesis that H 2 S biosynthesis is increased during the proliferative phase of human menstrual cycle. METHODS: Intact UA was obtained from hysterectomies of premenopausal women in the proliferative (UApro) or secretory (UAsec) phase (n=5/group). CBS/CSE mRNA was assessed by qRT-PCR and protein was assessed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. H 2 S production was determined by the methylene blue assay w/wo specific inhibitors of CBS (CHH, 1 mM) and CSE (BCA, 1 mM). RESULTS: UApro CBS mRNA and protein were 2.12 \u00b1 0.20 and 2.17 \u00b1 0.19 -fold greater (p<0.05) than that of UAsec, respectively. CBS protein was localized in UA intima and media, with 2.46 \u00b1 0.39 and 2.16 \u00b1 0.14fold greater (p<0.05) expression in UApro than UAsec, respectively. High levels of CSE mRNA and protein were detected in UApro and UAsec, but with no difference. CBS protein in the proliferative myometrium was 2.68 \u00b1 0.32-fold greater (p < 0.05) than that of the secretory myometrium and CSE protein was unchanged. CBS and CSE proteins were localized in myometrial microvessels with no changes between the phases. UApro H 2 S production was significantly greater (p<0.05) than that of UAsec, which was blocked by incubation with CHH or its combination with BCA, but not BCA alone. CONCLUSIONS: Significantly elevated H 2 S biosynthesis via selective CBS upregulation in human UApro implicates a role of a novel CBS/ H 2 S pathway in estrogen-induced uterine vasodilatation during the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle (supported by NIH RO1 HL 70562 and R01 HD08783). worldwide are anemic and half of these cases are attributed to iron deficiency. Daily oral iron and folic acid supplementation (30-60mg of elemental iron, once daily) is recommended to reduce the risk of low birth weight, maternal anemia and iron deficiency. Double dose is recommended by many obstetricians in cases of iron deficiency anemia. We sought to assess the efficacy of doubling the daily supplement of iron in anemic pregnant women. METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted at a community woman's health center from January 2009 to May 2013. A total of 302 pregnant women with iron deficiency anemia were randomized to receive one or two capsules of iron supplements (Aktiferrin F: Serine 129 mg; Iron (Ferrous Sulfate) 34 mg; Folic Acid 0.5 mg) daily from 18 weeks to delivery. Iron deficiency anemia was defined as hemoglobin (hb) concentration lower than 105 g/L along with ferritin level of less than 15 ng/ml after exclusion of other causes such as vitamin B12 deficiency or thalassemia. the major outcome measure compared between the two groups was maternal hb concentration at 35 weeks. Minor outcome measures included ferritin levels at 35 weeks, birth-weights, preterm birth rate and gastrointestinal side effects. RESULTS: 150 women were randomized to receive one capsule (group A) and 152 received two capsules (group B). Both groups had similar mean hemoglobin concentration (101gr/l) and ferritin levels at allocation (9.4 ng/ml and 9.3 ng/ml, respectively). Hemoglobin concentrations were similar also at 35 weeks (108.1 gl/l and 107.9 gl/l) as were ferritin levels (13.8 ng/ml and 14.2 ng/ml). Constipation was more common among women from group B (12% and 8%). No significant differences in birthweight (3258gr and 3303 gr) and preterm birth rate (<37weeks) (7.8% vs 7.4%) were found. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose iron supplement was found to be equally efficient with less side effects compared with double dose. are reported in spontaneous abortion, preeclampsia gestational diabetes (GDM); with GDM associated with elevated levels of AM. However, it is not known if IMD expression is altered in GDM placentas and if placental expression of AM, IMD and their shared 7TM receptor, calcitonin receptor like receptor (CRLR) and its 3 receptor activity modifying proteins (RAMP1, 2 or 3) are fetal sex dependent. This study was designed to assess if fetal sex has a role in regulating placental expression of AM, IMD and their receptor components in normal pregnancy and in pregnancy complicated with gestational diabetes. METHODS: Eleven placentas from normoglycemic and 12 diabetic women were collected term delivery. GDM was defined as two or more of the four plasma glucose concentrations exceeding ADA criteria(Report of the Expert Committee 1997).Villous tissue was used for gene expression and immunolocalization studies using qPCR and immunofluorescence respectively. RESULTS: 1) AM and IMD mRNA levels in villous tissue are not fetal sex dependent in normal pregnancy; 2) AM and IMD mRNA levels are significantly higher in female compared to male placenta in GDM (p<0.005);3) AM immunoreactivity is localized to cytotrophoblast cells in villous tissue and its intensity is similar in normal and GDM placenta, whereas IMD immunoreactivity is localized to both cytotrophoblast cells and vascular endothelial cells of fetal vessels and its staining intensity is higher in GDM compared to normal placental villi; 4) CRLR and RAMP1 mRNA in villous tissue are higher in placenta of female fetus compared to male in normal pregnancy (P<0.05); whereas, RAMP2 and RAMP3 mRNA levels remain similar; and 5) RAMP1and RAMP3 mRNA are significantly higher in placenta of female fetus compared to male (P<0.005) with no change in CRLR and RAMP2 mRNA expression. CONCLUSIONS: Placental expression of AM and IMD receptor components and not AM or IMD peptides are fetal sex dependent in normal pregnancy. Elevated placental levels of AM, IMD and their receptor component RAMP1 and RAMP3 in pregnancy with female compared to male fetuses, suggests involvement of these peptides in the sexual dimorphism in pregnancies complicated with GDM.",

            "text": "The Fetal growth restriction (FGR) describes the process through which the fetus fails to reach its predetermined growth potential and is known to be associated with increased incidence of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Placental dysfunction is thought to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of FGR. Perturbed trophoblast apoptosis has been linked to the pathophysiologic pathways encountered in placental failure or dysfunction. Through using stereology and concurrent image analysis, we aimed to quantify and characterize trophoblast apoptosis in placentas from normal pregnancies, and those complicated by hypertensive and normotensive FGR. METHODS: Placentas were weighed, randomly sampled, formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. Multiple representative full-thickness sections were labelled with monoclonal antibody M30, an epithelial apoptotic marker specific for a neo-epitope on cytokeratin 18. They were then digitally scanned, virtual slides reviewed and analyzed using Aperio ImageScope software. Thirty two fields of vision, randomly selected throughout the maternal and fetal aspects of each placenta, were analyzed by Positive Pixel Count algorithm to quantify the amount and grades of positive stain (weak, moderate, strong). Inter-group differences were sought using appropriate non-parametric statistical tests. RESULTS: Both hypertensive and normotensive FGR placenta expressed significantly higher levels of trophoblast apoptosis compared to control (22.6% vs 20% vs 6.5%, p<0.0001). Hypertensive FGR placenta showed significantly increased proportion of strongly positive stain compared to normotensive FGR placenta (11.9% vs 8.8%, p=0.01). Quantitative fetal/maternal zone discrepancies were not evident in any of the placental pathologies. CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasises the magnitude of the apoptotic burden in FGR placenta, more so when hypertensive disease is present. Furthermore, combining stereology and image analysis, to examine immune-labelled slides, is a powerful and a reproducible tool to quantify and characterize expression patterns of placental dysfunction. Autophagy is a tightly regulated intracellular lysosomal-mediated recycling process leading to the removal of old and/ or dysfunctional cytoplasmic organelles. It is essential for normal cell growth, development, and homeostasis, serving to maintain a balance between synthesis and degradation. Its involvement in reproduction and placental development has not been extensively studied but is thought to be linked to placental dysfunction implicated in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction. We aimed, through combining stereology and image analysis techniques, to characterise and quantify placental expression and distribution of LC3, an autophagy marker. METHODS: Placentas from pregnancies complicated by preterm preeclampsia (PPE) and term preeclampsia (TPE) were matched to those from normal pregnancies. They were weighed, randomly sampled, formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. Four representative full-thickness sections from each placenta were labelled with LC3, digitally scanned and analyzed using Aperio imageScope software. Thirty two fields of vision, randomly sampled throughout the maternal and fetal aspects of each placenta, were analyzed by Positive Pixel Count algorithm set to quantify the amount and the grades of positive staining (weak, moderate, strong). Appropriate statistical tests were used to seek inter-group differences. RESULTS: PPE placenta had a significantly higher proportion of strong positive stain compared to control (13% vs 8%, p=0.0003). On the other hand, TPE placenta showed a consistently higher levels of weak positive stain expression compared to control (p=0.0003). In normal placenta, LC3 distribution displayed maternal side abundance (p<0.0001), but this distribution was reversed in PPE placenta, with the fetal side showing higher expression (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: These results show that preeclamptic placenta had a higher autophagy burden compared to control, indicating an enhanced necessity for recycling unwanted intracellular waste before the apoptotic cascade is activated. Results also emphasize that not only placental dysfunction enhances autophagy expression, but also reverses the maternal/ fetal zonal distribution. The eNOS -/mouse provides a well characterized model of fetal growth restriction (FGR) with altered uterine artery reactivity and reduced utero-placental blood flow. Oxidative stress is implicated in vascular dysfunction in human FGR but it remains to be established whether oxidative stress is elevated in eNOS -/mice compared to their wild type counterparts. We hypothesize that eNOS -/mice demonstrate increased placental oxidative stress and that a dietary anti-oxidant therapy (pomegranate juice-PJ) will restore uterine artery function.",

Uterine arteries (UtA) were isolated from WT and eNOS -/mice treated from E12.5-18.5 with either PJ or isocaloric control (apple juice -AJ). Artery function was assessed by measuring contraction to phenylephrine [PE](0.1-10000nM) and endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine [Ach]; 0.1-10000nM) and -independent (sodium nitroprusside [SNP]; 0.1-10000nM) relaxation using wire myography. RESULTS: Both WT (n=5) and eNOS -/-(n=5) placentas showed higher expression of all 3 oxidative stress markers in the basal zone compared to the labyrinth zone; HSP70 p<0.0001, SOD-1 p=0.0199, SOD-2 p=0.0081. Furthermore, eNOS -/placentas had decreased levels of SOD-1 compared to WT in both the basal zone and labyrinth (p=0.043 and p=0.022 respectively). HSP70 and SOD-2 expression did not differ between genotypes (p=0.122 and p=0.337 respectively). PJ treatment (n=7) did not alter uterine artery reactivity compared to AJ (n=9) in WT mice. However, preliminary data (n=3) suggest that in eNOS -/mice, PJ treatment reduces UtA constriction in response to PE. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that eNOS -/mouse placentas have reduced anti-oxidant capacity compared to WT mice and highlight the potential importance of the basal zone in oxidative stress balance. Despite PJ not affecting uterine artery reactivity in WT mice, it shows promise as an anti-oxidant therapy in the vascular compromised eNOS -/mouse.",

METHODS: Texas Red-conjugated polymer was used for nanoparticle formation with a plasmid containing hIGF-1 under the control of the PLAC1 trophoblast-specific promoter. The complex was tracked throughout the organs of pregnant mice and their fetuses via ex vivo and microscopic imaging techniques at multiple time points following intraplacental or intravenous injection. Mouse organs were harvested and hIGF-1 expression measured using RT-PCR. Data were analyzed by the Student's t-test and a P\u2264 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Intraplacental Treatment: Fluorescence intensity of maternal liver and kidneys and placenta was increased compared to sham 2 hours post-injection, however fluorescence levels had returned to background levels 96 hours post-injection. Human IGF-1 RNA was expressed in the treated mouse placenta compared to control (ddCT 2 -12.96 vs 0, p<0.05,n=3), and to much lesser extent in maternal lung (13 fold) and ovary (70 fold), with no expression in brain, kidney or untreated sibling placentae. Intravenous Treatment: Whole organ fluorescence intensities in treated animals remained at background 48 and 72hrs post-injection. However, following sectioning, treated maternal lungs showed greater intensity at 72 hours; no other tissues fluoresced at that time point. At 72 hours post-intravenous treatment no hIGF-1 expression was measurable in any organs of the treated mouse. CONCLUSIONS: Successful hIGF-1 expression in the treated placenta following intraplacental nanoparticle injection substantiates the hIGF-1 nanoparticle as a viable treatment for FGR. Dispersal patterns of the nanoparticle following the more general intravenous injection, as well as gene expression in the intraplacentally-treated lung and ovary, must be controlled however. Future development of a peptide-sequence specific to the placenta for targeted-delivery will ensure that hIGF-1 expression is concentrated in the placenta, thus reducing any off-target effects in both the mother and the fetus. control key cellular processes such as development, growth and inflammation. This study was performed to determine whether alterations in placental miRNA expression are associated with maternal obesity and fetal overgrowth, independent of glucose intolerance. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed to investigate miRNA expression in placentas obtained from: (1) normal weight women (BMI 20-24.9 kg/m 2 ) with infants of normal birth weight (BW) (2700-3500 g) (n= 20), (2) normal weight women with macrosomic infants (BW \u2265 4000 g) (n= 10), (3) obese women (BMI \u2265 35 kg/m 2 ) with infants of normal BW (n= 16), and (4) obese women with macrosomic infants (n=10). All women had a term delivery (37-41 weeks) and normal glucose tolerance (1 hour GCT < 130 mg/dl). Exclusion criteria were: diabetes, chronic hypertension, preeclampsia, and chronic steroid use. Placental samples were collected after delivery, stored in trizol at -80C, and RNA was extracted using Qiagen miRNeasy kits. The expression of 5639 human miRNAs was assessed using the Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 3.0 Array. Differential miRNA expression was determined using two-way ANOVA and pairwise contrasts, with the Benjamini-Hocherg (BH) correction. MiRNAs with bias-corrected absolute Z scores \u2265 2 or BH < .05 were considered significant. RESULTS: One hour glucose challenge test values were overall similar among groups. Placental miRNA expression was not statistically different among the groups. For all 5639 miRNAs investigated, Z-scores were \u2264 2 and BH > .05. Principal components analysis demonstrated that the global miRNA expression profiles were similar in all groups [ figure 1 ]. *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Placental miRNA profiles were not altered by maternal obesity or macrosomia, independent of glucose intolerance. miRNA modulation of gene expression is an unlikely mechanism underlying fetal overgrowth related to maternal obesity, and other pathways should be explored. The progenitor cytotrophoblast of the human placenta can differentiates into one of two main pathways forming either the syncytiotrophoblast or the invasive extravillous trophoblast (EVT). The diversity of mRNA essential for cell differentiation and development is mediated in part by post transcriptional alternative splicing coding for protein isoforms. Rbfox2 plays a major role in controlling myoblast fusion. Interestingly, Rbfox2 also regulates invasive EMT (epithelial to mesenchymal transition). We suggest that Rbfox2 may act as a molecular switch directing cytotrophoblast differentiation to either syncytiotrophoblst formation or EVT. Thus the placenta may present a singular system of development where these two diverse pathways of Rbfox2 regulation may be studied.",

RESULTS: Rbfox2 is expressed in a trophoblast lineage specific manner in both normal and pathological placentas. Rbfox2 is expressed in the progenitor cytotrophoblast, reduced in the terminally differentiated syncytiotrophoblast (formed by cell fusion) and conversely, highly expressed in the invasive trophoblasts in an increasing gradient of expression towards the more invasive cells. Recapitulation of these observations in primary trophoblast syncytium in cell culture displayed reduced Rbfox2 expression.

Arsenic, at both doses interrogated, led to increased methylation at the regulatory region of Syncytin 1. Expression of Syncytin 1 was decreased in a manner consistent with increased methylation of the regulatory region. CONCLUSIONS: As(III) exposure is associated with a number of important perinatal complications, yet the impact of As(III) on trophoblast biology remains unclear. We demonstrate that As(III) leads to trophblast injury. Additionally environmentally relevant dose of arsenic caused epigenetic dysregulation of a gene critical to fusion of cytotrophoblasts to form syntiotrophoblasts. Taken together these data suggest that epigenetic perturbations are mechanistically involved in As(III)-induced trophoblast injury.

These groups were comprised of samples used in the prior microarray study. Placentas from healthy term pregnancies delivered by cesarean section before labor (37-40 wk, n=4) were collected immediately after delivery. TncRNA, NEAT1, and MEN\u00df expression in both BP and CV was examined by real-time (RT) PCR using a series of distinguishing primers. Term pregnancies were compared to early and mid-second trimester. Results were normalized to 18S rRNA. Student's t-test was used to compare experimental groups with statistical significance set at p<0.05. RESULTS: By relative quantification, NEAT1 increased 2.4-fold in BP at term versus early and mid-second trimester (p<0.05). A trend towards decreased NEAT1 expression in CV at term was observed, but this change was not significant. There were no significant differences in MEN\u00df expression. TncRNA levels increased in BP in a manner similar to NEAT1. CONCLUSIONS: NEAT1 expression increases in placental BP at term relative to second trimester, but not in CV. The similar increase in TncRNA (part of NEAT1)indicates that our prior results were in fact due to changes in NEAT1 expression. These findings suggest a role for NEAT1 in the regulation of placental gene expression during normal pregnancy. Given the potential role of NEAT1 in regulating RNA processing, effects of NEAT1 on placental gene expression are under investigation. Infection-associated pre-term labor (PTL) commonly leads to preterm birth, which is the leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. PTL is characterized by increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. Besides pro-inflammatory cytokines, PTL has also been associated with increased levels of the soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFLT-1) -an anti-angiogenic factor. Inflammatory responses and angiogenesis can be regulated upon activation of the PPAR-\u03b3 pathway. Therefore, we hypothesized that a PPAR-\u03b3 agonist (rosiglitazone) will attenuate the inflammatory response caused by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the placenta. METHODS: First trimester placental explants (n=4) were collected and exposed to 1ug/ml or 10ug/ml of LPS in presence or absence of 10\u00b5M of Rosiglitazone (PPAR-\u03b3 agonist). The expression of different PPAR-\u03b3 regulated and inflammation-associated genes was quantified by qPCR in placental explants. Levels of sFLT-1 and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) were determined in the supernatants by ELISA. RESULTS: Incubation with LPS up regulated the expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-8 and COX2 in first trimester placental explants. Concentrations of sFLT-1 increased in the supernatant upon LPS incubation, while concentration of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) reduced. Treatment with Rosiglitazone significantly down-regulated the expression of IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 (\u2265 3.0 folds, p\u00a30.05). Expression of COX2 was also down regulated but not significantly. Rosiglitazone induced the transcription and secretion of HO-1 in the supernatants (mRNA levels \u00b32.0 folds, p value \u00a30.05) and concentration of sFLT-1 was also reduced upon treatment with Rosiglitazone.",

CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the increased prevalence of activated leukocytes at the maternal-fetal interface with WSD consumption will increase local production of inflammatory cytokines resulting in altered placental vasculature and increased risk of ischemic injury. In these studies we utilized an invasive cps V strain of GBS (GB37) to assess macrophage metabolism and polarization, as well as the ability of this strain to alter the production of reactive oxygen intermediates. METHODS: Following infection with GB37 (or control), a multianalyte microphysiometer (MAMP) was utilized to dynamically measure glucose and oxygen consumption, lactate production, and extracellular acidification in vitro with murine macrophage-like cell line, RAW 264.7. Ultra performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) was also carried out to assess changes in the metabolome using human, macrophage-like THP-1 cells. GB37 was used in vitro to stimulate human monocyte derived macrophages to assess alterations in macrophage polarization by qRT-PCR using the M1 target CCR7 and the M2 targets CD209 and MRC1. Human term placental macrophages were used to address reactive oxygen intermediate generation when stimulated with GB37. RESULTS: GB37 stimulation induced an M1 phenotype in monocyte derived macrophages by expression of CCR7, significantly suppressed ROS in human term placental macrophages (p < 0.05) at 2hr, and altered the metabolism of murine RAW macrophages in vitro. Lactate production and extracellular acidification both decreased over time when exposed to GB37. MEDI heat maps were generated from the UPLC-MS data, showing significant differences in THP-1 cells when comparing PMA treatment with GB37 stimulation.

RESULTS: T/S was significantly lower in placenta from HF group (SF 1.7 \u00b1 0.3 vs. HF 0.8 \u00b1 0.2, P=0.04). The p53 mRNA levels were significantly increased in HF placenta (SF 0.6 \u00b1 0.1 vs HF 1.2 \u00b1 0.2, P=0.03, Figure) .

CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrates for the first time that prepregnancy obesity resulting from high fat diet contributes to modifications in aging pathways in the placenta, which in turn leads to placental dysfunction. Reduced anti-aging properties in the high fat group in combination with an increase in apoptosis markers demonstrate clear placental changes. Our study reveals novel insight to the physiological effects of obesity in pregnancy. and IUGR. Secondary to this maldevelopment, placental malperfusion may result in a repetitive ischaemia/hypoxia-reperfusion type of injury resulting in oxidative stress, which can compromise normal function of cellular components including mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We have shown that exposure of placentas to labour can provide a useful in vivo model for studying cellular changes induced by oxidative stress as seen in the preeclamptic placenta. In this study we further tested whether the labouring process in placentas from healthy pregnancies can also induce ER stress. METHODS: 16 placental samples were used for the study, including 8 caesarean section controls and 8 labour placentas. All placentas were delivered at term by standard vaginal delivery or by elective non-labour caesarean section (CS) from normotensive healthy singleton pregnancies. For each placenta, small pieces of tissue from separate lobules were randomly taken and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen within 10 min of delivery; the samples were stored at -80\u00b0C.

Exposure to labour may therefore present the opportunity to study placental cellular changes to oxidative and ER stresses in the absence of maternal factors.

Per patient, four placental bed punch biopsies were sampled during caesarean sections, stained for the presence of T-cells, NK cells and macrophages, and systematically studied using a newly developed scoring system to evaluate SA remodelling and several other characteristic features of the placental bed. In addition we compared modifiable cardiovascular risk factors directly postpartum. RESULTS: 232 biopsies were collected. Women with PE showed lower presence of T-cells in both decidua and myometrium (p=0.006 and p=0.047 respectively). An increase of macrophages was also observed but statistically not significant. Complete SA remodeling was significantly less often present in the PE group (p=0.008 Intensive expression of PHB1 was also localized by immunostaining in the trophoblast layer in PE compared to normal placentas.

CONCLUSIONS: Expression of PHB1 and PHB2 was increased in PE placentas. PHB1 siRNA induced an increase in CuZnSOD, but a decrease in MnSOD, expression in primary isolated placental trophoblasts. The increased CuZnSOD expression was associated with reduced 8-isoprostane production in PHB1 siRNA transfected cells.

Time pregnant mice were treated with CBS inhibitor, aminooxyacetic acid (AOA). Mean arterial blood pressure (MBP), histological assessments of placenta and embryos were performed. RESULTS: Placental CBS expressions were significantly reduced in women with FGR. Inhibition of CBS activity by AOA reduced PlGF production from first-trimester human placental explants, Administration of AOA to pregnant mice had no effects on blood pressure, but caused fetal growth restriction, which was associated with reduced placental PlGF production. Histological analysis revealed a reduction in the placental junction zone, within which trophoblast giant cells and glycogen cells were less prominent in CBS inhibitor-treated animals. Furthermore, H 2 S donor GYY4137 treatment restored fetal growth in pregnant mice exposed to high level of sFlt-1. CONCLUSIONS: These results imply that placental CBS is required for placental development and that dysregulation of CBS activity may contribute to the pathogenesis of FGR but not preeclampsia opening up the therapeutic potentials of H 2 S therapy in this condition. INTRODUCTION: Approximately 15% of women continue to smoke during pregnancy due to the highly addictive nature of nicotine. While nicotine replacement therapies are considered to be a safer alternative, nicotine alone has been found to cause hypoxia and compromised placental development. Although the underlying mechanisms remain elusive, recent studies identified that augmented endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress preludes placental insufficiency. Moreover, ER function depends on proper disulfide bond formation -a partially oxygendependent process mediated by protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and ER oxidoreductases. Given that: (1) nicotine induced hypoxia in the rat placenta, and (2) hypoxia and placental insufficiency were associated with poor disulfide bond formation and ER stress, we hypothesized that maternal nicotine exposure leads to both placental ER stress and impaired disulfide bond formation. METHODS: Female rats received daily subcutaneous injections of either saline (vehicle) or nicotine bitartrate (1mg/kg) for 14 days prior to mating and during pregnancy. Placentas were harvested on embryonic day (e) 15 for analysis. Protein and mRNA expression of hallmarks of ER stress (e.g., phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1, GRP78, ATF4, and CHOP), key players in the disulfide bond formation pathway (e.g., PDI, QSOX1, VKORC1), and hypoxia marker, HIF-1\u03b1, were quantified via Western blot and/or Real-time PCR.",

Finally, decreased mRNA and protein expression of PDI, VKORC1, and QSOX1 (p<0.05) reveal an impaired disulfide bond formation pathway, which may be due to nicotine-induced hypoxia as indicated through elevated protein expression of HIF-1\u03b1 (p<0.05).

Placentas from all mouse groups were collected at gd 18 and H&E staining was performed. For determination of proteinuria, the total albumin and creatinine concentrations were measured. RESULTS: miR-155 expression was significantly increased in placentas from patients with PE, CTBs treated with poly I:C and pregnant WT mice treated with poly I:C (P-PIC WT). Poly I:C treatment induced hypertension in P-PIC WT (gd 17 SBP: 147\u00b14.5 mmHg) compared to P WT mice (103\u00b12.7 mmHg), but had no effect in P-PIC miR-155 KO mice (101\u00b12 mmHg). P-PIC WT mice exhibited endothelial dysfunction, splenomegaly, proteinuria and placental necrosis compared to P WT mice and these were also attenuated in P-PIC miR-155 KO mice. Poly I:C treatment significantly induced fetal demise in P-PIC WT mice and this was also prevented in P-PIC miR-155 KO mice. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that TLR3-induced miR-155 expression contributes to inflammation leading to PE. INTRODUCTION: Hypertension during pregnancy is still a serious obstetrical problem. Hypertension and elevated levels of circulatory TNF-\u03b1 are strongly associated with PE but the pathophysiology of preeclampsia is unclear. Our previous data suggested that an inadequate CGRP-mediated compensatory vasodilatory response may play a role in the pathophysiology of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy; however, the mechanism involved in the action of CGRP peptides remains unknown. The present study was designed to determine the effects of TNF-\u03b1 on interactions of receptor components, calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) and receptor activity modifying protein (RAMP) 1, 2 and 3, on the cell membrane of rat mesenteric artery smooth muscle cells (RMASMCs), and assess if CGRP family peptides CGRP, adrenomedullin (AM), and intermedin (IMD) can rescue TNF-\u03b1-induced alterations. METHODS: RMASMCs were grown on Lab Tek chamber slides with or without TNF-\u03b1 (1ng/ml) for 16 h, and then treated with CGRP/AM/ IMD at 10nM. Proximity Ligation assay (PLA) was performed using a DuolinkII Fluoresence kit. Fixed cells were incubated with primary antibodies to CRLR and RAMPs, PLA probes, and mixture of ligation and amplification. Images were observed under fluorescence microscope and red spots were counted using CellSense Digital Imaging software in 3 -5 randomly selected fields.",

There is growing evidence for the involvement of bioactive lipid, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) in trophoblast differentiation and invasi\u00f3n, uterine angiog\u00e9nesis; all the cellular and physiological processes necessary to establish healthy placenta. We hypothesize that dysregulation of SPHK1/ S1P pathway during early placentation process may contribute to the onset of the disease. METHODS: Hypoxia was induced in human JAR cells or in extravillous placental explants by oxygen deprivation (1% PO2) for 3, 6, 16 and 24 hrs. IUGR in pregnant rabbits was induced by uteroplacental vessels ligature. Five mg of human or rabbit placental tissues were used for protein isolation and RNA extraction. Protein and mRNA levels were determined by Western blot and real-time PCR. RESULTS: Our preliminary results show that SPHK1/S1P pathway is altered in human term placentas of PE subjects and as well in rabbit placentas of IUGR model. Sphingosine kinase-1 (SPHK1) mRNA and protein abundance are decreased in human PE and rabbit IUGR placentas as compared to controls, suggesting that synthesis of angiogenic S1P is impaired in ischemic placentas. In in vitro model of placental hypoxia (JAR trophoblastic cells or extravillous placental explants, exposed to low PO 2 ), SPHK1 levels are increased in 1% oxygen in a time-dependent manner as compared to normoxic conditions. While it is known that SPHK1 and S1P are upregulated in hypoxic conditions to promote angiog\u00e9nesis in c\u00e1ncer cells, our results may suggest that inherited or induced downregulation of SPHK1/S1P pathway during early gestation is a potential cause of impaired uterine angiog\u00e9nesis and decidualization observed in PE patients.",

There were also significant (p<0.01) increases in cellularity, proliferation index, and thickness of the sFlt1-expressing EVT cell layer in the basal plate in PE. However, the number of apoptotic cells was the same in both normal and preeclamptic women. CONCLUSIONS: These results for the first time suggest that the expansion of the EVT layer in the basal plate may contribute to the observed increases in circulating levels of sFlt1 in PE. Only the percentage of male-gendered babies differed between complete and incomplete HELLP Syndrome (65.7% and 46.4%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: There are few differences between complete and incomplete HELLP syndrome with respect to newborn physiology and maternal placental pathology. Similar results were observed with analysis of each individual trait (data not shown). CONCLUSIONS: Genetic predisposition to common diseases did not increase the likelihood of preeclampsia in our cohort. Independent genetic factors may contribute to risk. Future work will examine common and rare genome-wide variation in patients with prior preeclampsia to identify novel genetic loci. A medical therapy that stimulates growth of the pre-eclamptic placenta and quenches sFlt1 and soluble endoglin production could be an efficacious treatment. Granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) may offer new therapeutic options given both are safe in pregnancy and contribute positively to pregnancy outcome; GM-CSF deficiency adversely impacts fetal and placental development, whilst addition to IVF culture media promotes embryo health and IVF success. EGF levels rise during pregnancy, and deficiency results in pregnancy loss in mice. This study aimed to assess whether GM-CSF or EGF could induce trophoblast proliferation and reduce sFlt1 secretion in primary human tissues. METHODS: mRNA expression of CD116 (GM-CSF receptor) and EGF receptor (EGFR) was assessed in severe early onset pre-eclamptic placentas (n=17) and gestationally matched controls (n=19). Proliferation kinetics of trophoblast cell lines, JEG3, BeWo and JAR cells were assessed with increasing concentrations of GM-CSF or EGF using the xCELLigence system. Primary trophoblast cells were purified, and the capacity of GM-CSF and EGF to improve cell viability assessed using an MTS assay. sFlt1 secretion was assessed by ELISA. RESULTS: mRNA expression of both CD116 and EGFR was significantly (p<0.05) upregulated in pre-eclamptic placentas. GM-CSF and EGF induced a significant increase in trophoblast cell line proliferation. Similarly, cell viability of primary trophoblasts was enhanced following treatment with GM-CSF. Excitingly, both GM-CSF and EGF induced a potent dose dependent reduction in sFlt1 release from primary human trophoblasts.

All were delivered vaginally. NEAT1 and MEN\u00df expression in both BP and CV was examined by real-time (RT) PCR. Preeclamptics were compared to controls of similar gestational age. Results were normalized to 18S rRNA. Student's t-test was used to compare experimental groups with statistical significance set at p<0.05. RESULTS: NEAT1 was 60% lower in CV from term preeclamptics compared to controls (p<0.05), with no difference seen in the corresponding BP samples. NEAT1 levels were not significantly changed in either BP or CV from preterm preeclamptics compared to preterm labor controls. There were no significant differences in MEN\u00df expression in any comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: NEAT1 expression decreases in CV from term preeclamptics compared to controls, but not in BP. Placentas from preterm preeclamptics show no change in NEAT1 compared to gestational ageappropriate controls. These findings suggest a role for NEAT1 in the regulation of placental gene expression in preeclampsia seen at term. Given the potential role of NEAT1 in regulating RNA processing, effects of NEAT1 on placental gene expression in preeclampsia will be explored further. and September 2013, were adjudicated by two maternal fetal medicine specialists.

Among these genes, 33 were upregulated and 79 were downregulated. PE specific genes, such as HTRA4 (fold change: 4.2, p<0.01), LEP (fold change: 5.1, p<0.01), PAPPA (fold change: 1.7, p<0.05), and ENG (fold change: 1.5, p<0.05) were significantly upregulated. Functional enrichment analysis showed that 33 of the 112 differentially expressed genes were located in the plasma membrane, including 5 up-regulated genes (including ENG and VTCN1) and 28 down-regulated genes. Also, 21 of the differentially expressed genes were extracellular, with 4 (including LEP and PAPPA) upregulated and 17 downregulated. CONCLUSIONS: The first placental RNA-seq results identified several genes up-regulated in PE, the majority of the differentially expressed genes were down-regulated, with most coding for membrane-associated or secreted proteins. In our study, careful selection of cases based on both clinical and histopathologic criteria has resulted more detail to develop a better understanding of PE pathogenesis. Intracellular S1P is exported by ABC-type transporters and signals through S1P2/S1P3 receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells (VMSCs) to stimulate constriction. Thromboxane A2 (TXA2), a vasoconstrictor, releases S1P from platelets and is elevated in preeclampsia. Whether TXA2 utilizes S1P to increase constriction is unknown. We hypothesize that TXA2 will activate SK in VSMCs of intact arteries increasing S1P release. S1P will engage S1P2/S1P3 receptors to stimulate constriction. METHODS: Murine uterine and mesenteric arteries mounted on a pressure myograph, were treated in the bath with the TXA2 mimetic, U46619 (1-100nM), with or without inhibitors to SK (1\u00b5M SK-II), ABC transporters (1\u00b5M F9054, 10\u00b5M MK571 or combined), S1P1/S1P3 (1\u00b5M VPC23019) or S1P2 (10\u00b5M JTE013). Arteries from S1P3-/-or S1P3+/+ wildtype mice were also used. In some cases phenylephrine (PE; 0.01-10 \u00b5M) replaced U46619.

Targeting the S1P pathway may be useful for the treatment of vascular-related disorders like preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. Supported by CIHR. is an insulin-like growth factor binding protein-5 (IGFBP-5) protease known to be elevated in preeclampsia (PE). IGFBP-5 binds IGF-1 and -2. Upon cleavage, IGF is released. IGF-1 and -2 levels are reduced in PE but whether placental or circulating PAPP-A2 account for alterations in IGF is not known. Therefore, we sought to establish the relationship between placental and serum PAPP-A2 with IGF-1 and -2 in maternal and fetal serum. METHODS: Chorionic villi (CV) samples, maternal and cord sera were obtained from PE and gestational-age matched normotensive singleton pregnancies, 24-41 wks gestation. PAPP-A2 immunoblot was performed on CV protein lysates and sera. IGF-1 and-2 sera levels were assessed by ELISA. Data CONCLUSIONS: PAPP-A2 in placental lysates and maternal serum is elevated in PE, but not detected in fetal circulation. Maternal IGF-1 and -2 are decreased in PE, as is fetal IGF-1. The correlation of CV, and not maternal serum, PAPP-A2 with IGF levels supports that it is primarily placental PAPP-A2 that impacts systemic maternal and fetal IGF availability, likely by releasing IGF from the systemic circulation for local utilization. Alternatively, CV PAPP-A2 levels may increase in response to low circulating IGF levels as a compensatory mechanism to combat the placental dysfunction and growth restriction that can be seen in PE. Pre-eclampsia is associated with increased maternal urate serum levels. Hyperuricemia might lead to longterm maternal cardiovascular risk and to fetal programming. The regulation of the placental urate transport system is not yet understood, but is likely to be predominantly regulated by GLUT-9 (glucose-transporter 9), besides the mulittransporter hOAT4 (human organic anion transporter). The aim of this study was to investigate the placental urate transport system and to characterize its transporter GLUT9.",

CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicates that urate transport in the placenta is unidirectional in the feto-maternal direction, because GLUT9 isoforms are expressed exclusively in the microvillous (apical) membrane of the trophoblast and because the organic anion transporter isoform 4 (OAT4) is known be localized on the basal membrane and to transport urate unidirectionally into trophoblast cells. Furthermore, GLUT9 uric acid transport activity is iodine-regulated by changing the mode of up-take from an electrogenic to an electroneutral transport.

We speculate that placental GLUT-1 expression is impaired in pre-eclampsia (PE), a disease known to be associated with GDM and IUGR, and could potentially lead to impaired glucose transport and altered fetal programming. METHODS: Placentae were obtained after elective caesarean sections following normal and PE pregnancies. Syncytial basal membrane (BM) and apical microvillus (MVM) fractions were prepared from syncytiotrophoblast (STB). Protein expression was assessed by western blot analysis and mRNA levels were quantified by rt-PCR. Radiolabeled glucose up-take assay and a transepithelial transport model using primary cytotrophoblasts (CTBs) were established to determine glucose transport activity. RESULTS: GLUT1 protein expression was significantly down-regulated in PE placentae compared to control placentae, while mRNA expression was unchanged. Glucose up-take into MVM was significantly reduced in PE compared to control.

CONCLUSIONS: Our study for the first time shows that in PE, GLUT1 is down-regulated on protein level and glucose transport activity is decreased.

Exogenous CO may be a potential non-invasive therapeutic treatment method. Data from our group has demonstrated that chronic exposure to 250ppm CO was effective in the prevention of hypertension and proteinuria in a sFlt1-induced mouse model of preeclampsia. This study aims to determine the effects of acute doses of CO on blood carboxyhemoglobin (%COHb) and end-tidal breath carbon monoxide (EtCO) levels in healthy female volunteers. METHODS: Healthy female volunteers (n=4) were exposed to 250ppm CO for 45 minutes; an initial dose of 15 minutes followed by six hourly doses of 5 minutes. %COHb and hemoglobin (Hb) were measured by head space gas chromatography and Hemocue respectively every hour following CO dosing. End-tidal breath CO was measured using a piCO Smokerlyzer non-invasive breath test both before and just following CO dosing. Data are presented as mean\u00b1SEM. Analysis was performed by repeated measures one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Dunn's test with significance of p<0.05. RESULTS: Blood %COHb increased from 0.73\u00b10.06% at baseline to 3.05\u00b10.27%. Increases in blood %COHb differed significantly from baseline at the 6 th and 7 th dose (p<0.05). End-tidal breath CO levels increased from 1.50\u00b10.29 ppm at baseline to 11.63\u00b10.90ppm, 12.00\u00b10.79ppm and 12.50\u00b10.84ppm after the 5 th , 6 th and 7 th doses respectively. Both blood %COHb and EtCO normalized to baseline values (p>0.05) 24 hours following initial CO dose. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary data demonstrates that intermittent dosing of inhaled 250ppm CO is effective in raising blood %COHb and breath EtCO levels in healthy female volunteers. Translation of CO dosing protocols from animal models to healthy volunteers is the first step towards exploring the potential of CO as a gaseous therapeutic for conditions such as preeclampsia. This study is currently ongoing. Preeclampsia is a vascular disorder in pregnancy and is biochemical characterization by high soluble Flt-1 and low placenta growth factor as well as an imbalance in redox homeostasis. During conditions of high oxidative stress, cysteine residues on key proteins are reversibly altered by S-glutathionylation, modifying their function. Glutaredoxin-1 (Glrx) enzymatically catalyzes the removal of S-glutathione adducts, conferring reversible signaling dynamics to proteins with redox-sensitive cysteines. The role of Glrx in preeclampsia is unknown. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis for Glrx or glutathione were conducted on human placenta samples collected pre-term from early onset preeclamptic patients (n=10) or non-preeclamptic induced deliveries (n=9). Human endothelial cells were infected with adenovirus encoding Glrx or LacZ prior to the cells being exposed to hypoxia (0.1% O 2 , 24h) to measure changes in soluble Flt-1 (sFlt-1). Quantitative PCR and ELISA were used to measure sFlt-1 at mRNA and protein level. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical staining for GSH revealed lower S-glutathionylation adducts in preeclampsia placenta in comparison to controls. Glrx expression, which catalyses de-glutathionylation was enhanced in early onset preeclampsia compared to pre-term control samples. In contrast, no change was observed in preeclamptic and IUGR placentas at full term. In endothelial cells overexpressing Glrx, sFlt-1 expression was dramatically enhanced at mRNA (3-fold P<0.05) and protein level (5 fold P>0.01, n=4) after hypoxia andoverexpressing Glrx in mice enhanced levels of circulating sFlt-1 during in vivo ischemia. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced Glrx expression in preeclamptic placenta in line with an apparent decrease in S-glutathionylation may leave key proteins susceptible to irreversible oxidation in conditions of high oxidative stress. The spectrum of visceral pain symptoms experienced by endometriosis patients suggests a dialogue between endometriosis lesions and the central nervous system (CNS). Sustained inflammation and production of prostaglandins is a mechanism for activation of nerve fibers innervating lesions. We hypothesize that prostaglandins play a role in establishing changes in the CNS that leads to enhanced pain perception in endometriosis. METHODS: Sensory behavior was analyzed in a validated mouse model of endometriosis compared to na\u00efve and OVX+E2 control mice using a choice test (explorative behavior) and the Von Frey filaments test (mechanical allodynia). 5 mg/kg TG6-10-1 (EP2 antagonist) and 10 mg/kg L-161982 (EP4 antagonist) were injected i.p and the Von Frey test performed. Single immunohistochemistry, dual-label immunofluorescence, and QPCR were performed on peritoneum, lesions and L5-6 dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Western blot analysis was performed on lower lumbar spinal cord. RESULTS: Mice with endometriosis exhibited decreased explorative activity (p<0.01) and increased sensitivity when Von Frey filaments were applied to the abdomen and hindpaw (p<0.05 and p<0.01) compared to controls. EP2, EP4 and COX1 mRNAs were elevated in lesions compared to the peritoneum (p<0.001, p<0.01, p<0.001). COX2 mRNA was elevated in the peritoneum (p<0.05) and lesions (p<0.01) of endometriosis mice compared to peritoneum from na\u00efve mice. Immunolocalisation studies confirmed these findings. EP2, COX1, SCN11A and TRPV1 mRNAs were increased in DRG from endometriosis mice (p<0.05) compared to controls. Dual immunofluorescence revealed increased TRPV1 expression in peripherin and neurofilament-200 positive DRG. Western blot analysis revealed elevated COX2 protein (p<0.01) in the spinal cord. CONCLUSIONS: Endometriosis mice exhibited significant changes in sensory behavior and an increase in the expression of nociceptive ion channels in DRG. This is linked to expression of COX2 and thus an increased ability for prostaglandin synthesis in the lesion and peritoneal environment (peripheral) and in the spinal cord (central). These data suggest prostaglandin receptor antagonists may alleviate endometriosisassociated pain.",

In this model endometriosis is produced in cycling rats by an auto-transplantation of uterine tissue punches onto abdominal arteries of the mesentery and the colon where they develop into cysts. The surgery induces vaginal and visceral hyperalgesia, whose severity is greatest in proestrus and which can be measured by the vaginal distension method. Furthermore, the cysts as well as dorsal root ganglia (DRG) from animals undergoing surgery were analyzed by an immuno-histochemical approach in order to validate the innervation of the cysts and the activation of the respective DRGs. RESULTS: Our data indicates that we developed a robust model to measure hyperalgesia in order to test clinical candidates for the treatment of endometriosis. Immuno-histochemical analysis of the marker PGP9.5 (nerve fibers) and CGRP (C-fibers) showed a high innervation of the cysts. This finding might underline the measured hyperalgesia in this model. Immuno-histochemical analysis of DRGs has revealed important information about the expression levels of different pain markers relevant for disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: With the development of a rat \"dyspareunia model\" and the histological approach for target validation we attained useful tools to test clinical candidates for the treatment of endometriosis. are considered significant sources of stress, and we have recently demonstrated that stress can worsen an animal model of endometriosis. In many chronic conditions exercise can act as a stress buffer, both exercise and stress known to influence pain perception. Depending on the nature of stressors, different mechanisms may be activated leading to analgesia/ hyperalgesia. We tested the effect of forced swimming (a physical stressor) on pain perception and receptor expression in endometriosis. METHODS: Endometriosis (endo) was induced in female rats by suturing uterine horn tissue next to the intestinal mesentery. Sham rats had sutures only. Some rats were exposed to swim stress for 7 consecutive days; no stress were left in home cage. Fecal pellets were counted (FPC) during the stress protocol as a measure of anxiety, and corticosterone levels (CORT) measured. Changes in pain perception were assessed using the hot plate test for hyperalgesia and Von Frey test for allodynia. Mu opioid receptor (MOR) and NK-1R expression in the spinal cord was measured by immunofluorescence. At sacrifice tissues were collected and the vesicles measured. RESULTS: Stress groups gained less weight during the protocol. The endo-stress group had higher anxiety levels (FPC) than endo-no stress (p<0.01) and sham-no stress (p<0.05); the sham-stress group also had higher anxiety levels (FPC and CORT) than no stress groups (p<0.05). Endo-stress rats had higher colonic damage (p<0.05) and more cellular infiltration. Surprisingly, vesicles in the endo-stress animals were smaller than in endo-no stress. Forced swimming helped ameliorate hyperalgesia in sham but not endo whereas it improved allodynia in both endo and sham animals. MOR expression was significantly higher in endo-stress versus endo-no stress (p<0.01) similar to sham-no stress levels. In 40% of women, no underlying pathology is identified, and the pain is very difficult to manage. Gabapentin has been shown to be effective for other chronic pain conditions. It is being increasingly prescribed for CPP despite no evidence of efficacy.",

A probabilistic decision analytical model was used to estimate the potential cost-effectiveness of gabapentin. RESULTS: 34% (47) of eligible women were randomised into the study (September 2012 to 2013), and 53% were followed up until six months with completed pain scores. The majority of participants described their overall trial experience favourably: positive responses were recorded for the recruitment approach used, paperwork burden for participants and the experience of randomisation. Analysis of one of the pain scores (BPI questionnaire) indicated that patients randomised to gabapentin perform better than placebo: 1.72 points, 95%CI: 0.07 to 3.36 at six months (p=0.041). We showed that, at the typical threshold for willingness to pay in the UK, there is a greater probability of gabapentin being cost-effective compared with no active treatment.

Despite the likely importance of the lymphatic system in many aspects of endometriosis, detailed knowledge is lacking.

METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining was performed on paraffinembedded uterine-draining iliac lymph nodes (endometriosis = 6, control = 9) and deep infiltrating endometriotic bowel lesion-associated nodes (n = 12). Cell numbers (percentage positive area) and antigen expression (optical density) of CD10+ endometrial-like cells; CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ and FoxP3+ T cells; DC-Lamp+ and DC-Sign+ dendritic cells; CD20+, CD79+ and plasma B cells; CD68+ macrophages and CD57+ natural killer cells were measured. RESULTS: In uterine-draining iliac nodes, DC-Sign+ numbers and CD4 expression peaked during menstruation (p=.027, p=.03; respectively), and CD20 expression significantly decreased between the proliferative and secretory phases (p=.04).In deep infiltrating bowel lesion associated nodes compared to iliac nodes, CD10+ endometrial-like cells were decreased (p=.002), as were DC-Lamp+ (p=.001), CD20+ (p<.001) and CD57+ (p=.005) numbers and DC-Lamp (p<.001), CD79 (p=.011) and CD57 (p=.012) expression; while CD3+ (p=.002) and CD4+ (p=.007) numbers, and FoxP3 (p=.018) expression were increased.

Cyclical immune changes in uterine-draining iliac lymph nodes are linked to their essential roles in the regulation of the inflammatory process of menstruation. In bowel lesion-associated nodes, endometrial-like cells are present and immune responses are altered compared to uterine-draining nodes indicating decreased capacity to contain endometrial-like tissues. This may contribute to spread and/or reoccurrence of the disease. INTRODUCTION: Glycosylation is one of the most common posttranslational modifications of eukaryotic proteins and is known to undergo dynamic changes in a wide range of biological processes. To date, however, the glycan expression profiles in endometriosis are largely unknown. The objective of the study was to identify the panel of glycans that were aberrantly expressed in endometriosis, a hormone-dependent disease.",

INTRODUCTION: Retrograde menstruation describes the escape of menstrual debris including endometrial tissue through the fallopian tubes into the pelvis. The general accepted hypothesis is that such uterine tissue delivered to the peritoneum via retrograde menstruation causes inflammation and that additional mechanisms such as tissue repair, proliferation and scar formation potentially lead to the development of endometriosis (Sampson's Theory). However, the pathology and the underlying biologic processes of this phenomenon cannot be investigated so far due to the lack of an appropriate animal model. Here we show that retrograde menstruation mimicked by inoculation of uterine tissue in the peritoneal cavity of mice induces an inflammatory environment in the peritoneum as well as spontaneous pain. METHODS: Syngeneic uterine tissue has been injected from donor mice into recipient mice. Inflammation has been analyzed by detection of proinflammatory cytokines in the peritoneal lavage and in the injected tissue using a multiplex ELISA. Immune cells of the peritoneal lavage have been analyzed using flow cytometry. Non-evoked pain responses have been detected by the newly developed dynamic weight bearing system. RESULTS: Pelvic inflammation characterized by elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the peritoneal cavity was present four days after inoculation. Furthermore, murine retrograde menstruation triggers a rapid elevation of neutrophils into the peritoneum followed by an influx of other innate immune cells underlying the inflammatory process induced by the presence of uterine tissue in the peritoneal cavity. Spontaneous pelvic pain behavior has been detected within the four days after inoculation of the uterine tissue. In addition, we show that the amount of uterine tissue present in the peritoneum impacts the intensity of both inflammation and pain. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that uterine tissue present in the peritoneal cavity induced by retrograde menstruation can induce processes associated with inflammatory pain in dependence of the amount of uterine tissue with possible implications for the mechanisms underlying the development of endometriosis. In this study, we tested the hypothesis of whether serum cytokines, lipids or their combination has better discrimination potential.",

There is a need for a non-surgical diagnostic test, but as of yet, no such test has been elucidated. We aimed to identify serum biomarkers of endometriosis that could serve as a minimally invasive means of diagnosis. METHODS: Serum was obtained from 12 women with stage III/IV endometriosis and 12 non-endometriosis controls. Sera was analyzed using a validated serum proteomics approach and analyzed via mass spectrophotometry. Peak heights were analyzed between cases and controls using student's t-test. Potential biomarker panels were identified using forward selection logistic regression. RESULTS: 39 potential biomarkers were found, and 6 of these were identified using MS/MS fragmentation. Endometriosis is an inflammatory disease that affects up to 10% of reproductive age women. Our objective was to dissect the pathophysiology of endometriosis contributed specifically by the epithelial and stromal cells of the eutopic endometrium. METHODS: Each proliferative, eutopic, endometrium sample was digested and sorted for epithelial and stromal cells by FACS and divided for paired RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and miRNA microarray. Cell type specific differentially expressed genes and miRNA were validated, with statistical significance, and analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis networks (IPA). Within each cell type, miRNAs and their targets were identified and validated with miRNA mimics and antagomirs. RESULTS: Over 23,900 genes and 1300 miRNAs were detected from the epithelial and stromal cells collected from normal and endometriosis subjects, with distinct clustering between endometrial epithelial versus stromal cells and normal versus disease. Compared to control, there were 220 and 154 differentially expressed genes from endometriotic epithelial and stromal cells, respectively, with only five common differentially expressed genes between these two cell types (CSF3, LTBP4, SERPINA1, ASH1L, PIK3R1). There were 16 and 9 differentially expressed miRNAs from endometriotic epithelial and stromal cells, respectively (Epithelial: miR-375, 1827, 504, 548n, 4450; Stromal: miR-200b, 204, 1297, 548o, 4445) . Specifically, endometriotic epithelial cells expressed genes and miRNAs that stimulate immune cell trafficking, inflammation, and vascularization through the IL1/AKT pathways. In contrast, endometriotic stromal cells expressed genes and miRNAs known to modulate immune cell trafficking, inflammation and phagocyte maturation through the NFkB/ERK pathways. Crucially, the differentially expressed miRNAs were shown to regulate the pathways of IL1/AKT and NFkB/ERK in endometriotic epithelial and stromal cells respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Eutopic endometrial epithelial cells and stromal cells have distinct differential gene and miRNA expressions and unique pathways in endometriosis patients. Distinguishing between epithelial and stromal cells has clarified the two distinct sets of genes and miRNAs that are differentially expressed in endometriosis yet have common functions of immune cell trafficking and inflammation. Although several studies have identified multiple contributory factors responsible for uterine fibroid growth and proliferation, it is not well documented as to the role vitamin D3 plays in modulating the expression of proteins in uterine fibroid cells.",

We identified women in THIN database aged 12-54 years between Jan 2000 and Dec 2010 with a first recording of a Read code indicating endometriosis. Among those without a record indicating endometriosis, three separate follow-ups were performed to identify women with a Read code for hysterectomy, dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia. For a random sample of women in each of these groups, a validation process was undertaken to assess the potential for false negatives.This was achieved by the manual review of free-text comments from medical records. For women with a record of hysterectomy, the responses to questionnaires sent to their PCPs were analyzed. RESULTS: From a cohort of 866,295 women, 5087 women were identified with a record of endometriosis, an incidence of 1.02 (95% CI: 0.99-1.05) per 1000 person-years. The proportion of women with endometriosis among those with a code for endometriosis, dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia and hysterectomy was 99.4%, 3.5%, 0% and 9.5%, respectively. Extrapolating these percentages, we estimated that the number of women with endometriosis among those with a code for endometriosis, dysmenorrhea and hysterectomy was 5057, 950 and 1428, respectively. Based on this, the resulting incidence of endometriosis was estimated to be 1.49 (95% CI: 1.46-1.52) per 1000 person-years. CONCLUSIONS: Using Read codes as the only strategy to identify women with endometriosis in THIN results in underestimation of the incidence.

This increased transcriptional activity directly contributes to the bulk of these tumors and symptomatology. The Polycomb group proteins are a group of histone associated protein complexes that regulate the epigenetic control of transcription. One set of proteins, PRC2, function to suppress transcription by modifying histones. EZH2 is the histone methyltransferase (HMT) of PRC2, that adds methyl groups to histone H3 at lysine residue 27, creating H3K27me3. This modification results in condensed chromatin, limiting accessibility of the genome to transcription factors. Tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine residue 4 yields a mark of increased transcription, H3K4me3. Careful regulation of H3K27 and H3K4 methylation may be essential for normal ECM production.

Five miRNAs expression were decreased and 12 were elevated during the cycle. Pathway analysis revealed that these miRNAs target key players in the PI3K/AKT and TGF\u03b2 signaling pathways. Comparing PCOS patients to normal ovulating women serum at the early follicular phase identified 29 differentially expressed miRNAs. Twenty seven circulating miRNAs were differentially expressed between the groups immediate post ovulation. Similar pattern of reduced expression was found for 6 miRNAs in the PCOS group and 10 in the normal ovulating, in GLC isolated from these women. CONCLUSIONS: There is a unique miRNAs expression profile during different phases of the human ovarian cycle. These miRNAs can be detected in the human serum. Major cellular signaling pathways might be regulated by these miRNAs. Anovulatory women exhibit altered miRNA expression profile. This unique profile might be a reflection of an aberrant ovarian function in anovulatory women. miRNAs expression profile might serve as a novel serum-based biomarker, potentially offering insight into the human ovulation.

Proximity to major roadways and outdoor levels of particulate matter less than 10 microns (PM 10 ), between 2.5 and 10 microns (PM 2.5-10 ), and less than 2.5 microns (PM 2.5 ) were determined for all residential addresses for 36,294 women from 1993 to 2003. Infertility was defined by report of attempted conception for \u00b312 months without success. Participants were able to report if evaluation was sought and if so, offer multiple clinical indications for infertility. Multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the relation between distance to road or PM exposures and infertility risk. Polytomous regression was used to assess potential differences in associations with primary and secondary infertility. RESULTS: Over 213,416 person-years, there were 2,508 incident reports of infertility. Results for overall infertility were mixed, however there were statistically significant elevations in risk in the group of primary infertility. The multivariable adjusted HR (95%CI) comparing those living closer to a major road vs living farther from a major road with primary infertility was 1. Median hormone levels (IQR: Q3-Q1) were significantly different between groups (Table) . Serum relaxin was undetectable in patients lacking a CL (<7.8 pg/ml). Those with one CL exhibited a median relaxin value of ~180 pg/ml. As the number of CL increased, so did the serum concentration of relaxin.

Despite higher pregnancy rates, the live birth rate in the gonadotropin group did not differ significantly. When controlling for confounding factors, logistical regression revealed that the type of stimulation cycle still predicted pregnancy success rates (p= 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Donor sperm IUI is a good option for women trying to conceive with an overall pregnancy rate of 17% per cycle. Gonadotropins produced higher pregnancy rates over ovulation induction and natural cycles. Live birth rates, however, were not statistically significant between the groups. This suggests natural cycle IUI may be as effective as gonadotropin injections in this population of women.",

The objective of this study was to characterize the progesterone receptor (classical membrane progesterone receptor (PR) or membrane progesterone receptors derived from the progestin and adipoQ receptor family (PAQR)) involved in the rapid cell signaling that occurs after progesterone (P 4 ) stimulation in the kisspeptin neuron. METHODS: Immortalized Kiss1 cells derived from adult, female mouse hypothalamus were thawed and plated on poly-D-lysine coated glass coverslips and maintained in DMEM/ 10% FBS at 37 o C with 5% CO 2 for 2-3 days. The cells were then loaded with a calcium (Ca 2+ ) indicator dye (4.5mM Fluo-4 AM) for 45 minutes and subsequently placed into a quick exchange platform for imaging on the LSM 710 confocal microscope. Gravity perfusion treatment with HBSS, 1nM P 4 , and 10nM RU486 (a P 4 antagonist acting at the classical PR) was performed with continuous vacuum suction. Fluo-4 AM imaging was performed using a waterimmersion objective with 488nm laser excitation and emission monitored through a low-pass filter with a cutoff at 505nm. The increase in Ca 2+ fluorescence (measured in relative fluorescence units or RFU) following P 4 stimulation with or without RU486 pretreatment was compared with 2-way ANOVA. In both groups, despite quality blastocysts, aneuploidy was detected by CGH in 27% of GS blasts and 74% of Infertile blasts. Moreover, 12 out of 82 Infertile women did not produce any chromosomally normal blasts; 85% of which were complex aneuploidy. Clearly, morphologic description alone, without PGS, has a poor predictive value for top quality euploid blastocysts. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms a high rate of naturally occurring aneuploidy in normal fertile women. Only 25% of GS oocytes developed into healthy euploid blastocysts. However, in the female factor infertility group, only 8% of oocytes developed into healthy euploid blastocytes. Despite both groups producing good numbers of oocytes, we found a high occult rate of aneuploidy in both groups. These results suggest that embryo selection for transfer is difficult at best on Day 2 to 3, will be improved by morphologic progression to good quality blastocyst and optimized by the addition of PGS. We have previously characterized fibroblasts isolated from adhesion tissues (ADF) to manifest a persistent pro-oxidant state as compared to normal peritoneal fibroblasts (NPF) isolated from the same patient(s). Hypoxia and resultant oxidative stress causes NPF to irreversibly acquire the adhesion phenotype. Moreover, ADF manifest an overexpression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, a key superoxide producing oxidant enzyme. Increased NADPH oxidase activity has also been associated with a tyrosine to histadine switch resulting from a specific C242T SNP (rs4673). The objective of this study is to determine the presence of this SNP in ADF and whether hypoxia induces this SNP in NPF. We will also evaluate expression of cytidine deaminase, an enzyme responsible for converting cytosine bases to uracil, in NPF and ADF cells under normal and hypoxic conditions. METHODS: Primary cultures of fibroblasts were previously established from normal peritoneal and adhesion tissues from the same patient. The NADPH oxidase SNP (rs4673) was analyzed using specific TaqMan probes that quantitate the abundance of this polymorphism in NPF and ADF before and after exposure to hypoxia (2% O 2 , 24 hrs). Assessment of cytidine deaminase mRNA levels utilizing real-time RT-PCR was also performed.A Student's t-test was used and values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: ADF exhibited increased in the NADPH oxidase polymorphism (53.7%, p<0.05) as compared to NPF (25.2%, p<0.05). Exposure of NPF to hypoxia significantly increased acquisition of this polymorphism, from 25.2% to 51.8% (p<0.05). Levels of cytidine deaminase were significantly increased in both NPF exposed to hypoxia (28%, p=0.0452) and in ADF (37%, p=0.0187). CONCLUSIONS: Hypoxia resulting from tissue injury triggers a genotype switch in NADPH oxidase, and possibly other key oxidants and antioxidants, leading to the persistence of a pro-oxidant state, which contributes to the development of postoperative adhesions. The mechanism of this genotype switch involves the upregulation of cytidine deaminase. Scavenging oxidants as well as targeting cytidine deaminase may have beneficial preoperative effects. infertility; to evaluate risk of cancellation and ovarian hyperstimulation; and to compare pregnancy and live birth rates among women using ART with endometriosis-associated as compared to male factor infertility.",

INTRODUCTION: It is widely thought that in vitro fertilization (IVF) pregnancy rates increase with increasing numbers of oocytes retrieved and, therefore, oocyte or embryo banking may increase overall pregnancy rates. We sought to develop an age-specific prediction model of pregnancy rate (PR) based on the number of oocytes retrieved. METHODS: Data were collected from IVF retrievals at a single academic institution over 2 years. Variables included patient age, AMH, total FSH used, number of oocytes obtained, number of lead follicles, number of embryos transferred and PR. Data were analyzed using Chi square, linear regression, and stepwise logistic regression with SPSS software. RESULTS: A total of 874 cycles were reviewed with an overall PR of 55.5%. The number of oocytes retrieved in a single cycle was highly predictive of PR (p<0.01), and remained statistically significant when controlling for age, AMH and total FSH used. However, the number of oocytes retrieved in a single cycle demonstrated an age-related threshold effect above which increased oocyte yield did not further improve PR: >15 oocytes at <36 years, >10 oocytes between 36-38 years, and >5 oocytes at >38 years. Cumulative PR by the sum of oocytes retrieved over two cycles was compared to the nomograms for single cycles; for a given number of oocytes, the pregnancy rate was higher if the oocytes were derived from a single cycle rather than over the course of two cycles. *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: While PR improves with higher oocyte yield, there is an age-specific threshold beyond which no further benefit is noted. The establishment of clinic-specific nomograms can be used to counsel patients on their individual fecundability during an IVF cycle based on ovarian response. Furthermore, these data suggest that egg or embryo banking, particularly in older patients, may not significantly improve overall pregnancy rates.",

Without a standard methodology to eliminate contaminated samples, the results from ROS markers will be unreliable and difficult to compare among the groups. The human endometrium must undergo extensive remodelling during a woman's menstrual cycle to create a receptive environment for embryo implantation and development. Following menses, the endometrium regenerates and enters the proliferative phase when the glands initially develop. Glands and their secretions are essential for embryo implantation and development, which occurs in the subsequent secretory phase. Hence, the proliferative phase, during which the endometrium regenerates, is critical in the formation of a stable foundation for endometrial receptivity and embryo implantation. The proliferative phase and its significance in determining female fertility or infertility has been rarely examined. We hypothesised that alterations in the cytokine profile in uterine fluid of idiopathic infertile women would indicate a disturbance in endometrial regeneration during the proliferative phase, rendering the endometrium unable to achieve receptivity. Our aim was to determine the concentrations of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors in the uterine fluid of fertile and infertile women.",

METHODS: Isolated, purified FT-DCs cultures (n=5), obtained from elective termination between 6 and 12 weeks of gestation, were treated for 8 days in a defined medium with either control vehicle, 10-8 mol/L E2, 10-7 mol/L MPA and E2+MPA alone or together with the antiprogestin RU486. RNA was purified and relative mRNA levels of 11beta-HSD1 and 11beta-HSD2 were assessed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR.",

E2 did not stimulate 11beta-HSD activity while treatment with E2+MPA induced 11beta-HSD1 maximally (34 fold; p<0.001) but had no effect on 11beta-HSD2 mRNA levels. MPA alone stimulated suboptimally of not at all, suggesting the need of E2-enhancement of progesterone receptor levels among FT-DCs.

While \u00df-DG is anchored within the plasma membrane, \u03b1-DG attaches to \u00df-DG extracellularly. The central region of \u03b1-DG is highly glycosylated and mediates adhesion; however, this region is masked by its large N-terminus (\u03b1-DG-N, 312 amino acid long). We hypothesized that \u03b1-DG-N on the plasma membrane is a barrier for embryo attachment and that endometrial receptivity requires \u03b1-DG-N removal by a protease, proprotein convertase 5/6 (PC6) which is specifically up-regulated in the receptive phase.

Ishikawa cells expressing the Wut-DG retained \u03b1-DG-N on the plasma membrane and showed significantly reduced receptivity to fibronectin and trophoblast spheroids attachment. In women in vivo, the \u03b1-DG-N cleaved from the endometrium was detected in the uterine fluids, and importantly Western blot and a purpose-built high throughput ELISA detected significantly higher levels of \u03b1-DG-N levels in uterine lavages in the receptive phase. CONCLUSIONS: DG plays an important role in endometrial receptivity and its adhesive function is regulated post-translationally by PC6-mediated proteolytic cleavage of \u03b1-DG-N. The \u03b1-DG-N removed from the plasma membrane is a potential biomarker for endometrial receptivity in women. Human endometrium is a complex tissue whose composition changes dynamically over the cycle, potentially confounding transcriptome analysis of whole tissue. The most commonly used transcriptome analysis method, DNA microarray, has dynamic range disadvantages in comparison to newer RNA sequencing methods. We sought to study cyclic changes in the endometrial transcriptome using cell separation and RNA sequencing. METHODS: Human endometrial biopsies in the mid-late proliferative (MLP-n=5) and mid-secretory phases (MSE-n=5) were obtained, timed by cycle day and urine LH testing. Samples were divided for whole tissue analysis and cell separation using enzymatic digestion and unigravity sedimentation. Total RNA was used for directional RNA-Sequencing. Libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA protocol and sequenced (100 bp paired ends) using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Reads (~50-60 million/sample) were quality trimmed (error probability 0.001) and then mapped to the NCBI genome (Homo sapiens GRCh37.p13) using CLC Genomics Workbench. Reads per kilobase transcript per million values were evaluated using the EDGE method. Microarray data from normal endometrium used for comparison was obtained from GEOdatabase. RESULTS: Whole endometrial RNA-Seq analysis revealed 1489 differentially expressed genes between MLP and MSE phases, while similar comparisons using isolated stromal and epithelial cells yielded 927 and 851 genes respectively. From 1839 genes, 859 (47%) were unique to a specific cell type comparison, while 448 differentially expressed genes were seen in all comparisons. RNA sequencing yielded fewer genes than that published for microarray of whole endometrium (6837 vs 1489), but yielded unique differentially expressed transcripts. Among these unique genes identified by RNA-Seq was beta-1,4-N-acetyl-galactosaminyl transferase 2 (high in MSE), a protein suggested to be essential for murine embryo implantation. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study comparing the genes expressed in human endometrium using RNA-sequencing to different compartments of human endometrium and to microarray data. Identification of novel genes involved in normal endometrial physiology may provide new insights into endometrial physiology.",

Genes found to be significantly differentially expressed were based on a FDR of 0. RESULTS: Deletion of AhR resulted in at least 2-fold upregulation of 277 genes and at least 2-fold down-regulation of 124 genes after setting FDR to 0. Deletion of AhR was confirmed. Expression of ESR1 (an alternate LXA4 receptor) was significantly decreased while expression of ALOX5 was increased by AhR deletion. RT-PCR demonstrated a 5-fold increase in ALOX5 and a 47.5-fold increase in FPR2 in AhR deleted cells. Treatment of control cells with TCDD resulted in increased expression of Cyp1a1, Cyp1b1, ALDH3a1, and TIPARP, all known AhR targets, but no further effects on LXA4 pathway genes. Further analysis of these data are underway. CONCLUSIONS: Increased expression of AhR in the eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis could underlie the profound changes in LXA4 synthesis and signaling we have previously described (SRI Meeting 2014) and contribute to the chronic inflammation seen in women with this disease.",

Endometrial scratching or injury has been reported to improve pregnancy rates in women with infertility. The objective of this study was to examine our own experience in unexplained infertility (UI) and compare the time to pregnancy after scratching to laparoscopic surgery (L/S). METHODS: Women with UI were included if they were ovulatory, had partners without significant male factor, and had at least one patent fallopian tube. Three groups of patients were compared: UI controls, subjects who underwent endometrial biopsy, and patients who underwent diagnostic L/S. Monitored cycles and time to pregnancy were compared between the groups. The primary outcome measure was time to successful pregnancy over 6 months of followup. RESULTS: A total of 62 subjects with and 103 control-subjects without UI endometrial biopsies were evaluated. Ninety-eight subjects had diagnostic L/S for evaluation and treatment of UI. Monitored cycles and pregnancy outcomes were compared between each group. Demographic characteristics for each group was similar for race, BMI, parity, and type of treatments. Controls had a lower overall gravidity (p = 0.0002). Compared to controls, subjects undergoing endometrial scratching were older (p < 0.001). The overall time to pregnancy was significantly shorter in the biopsy group compared to controls (p = 0.001). Significant difference (p < 0.05) between control and biopsy groups was only evident in the first 2 months. Interestingly, the short-term benefit, based on life table analysis, for endometrial biopsy and diagnostic L/S were surprisingly similar (p = 0.11) *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Endometrial biopsy improves short term cycle fecundity in women with unexplained infertility compared to controls to the same degree as diagnostic laparoscopy. Endometrial biopsy should be considered as a first line procedure for the evaluation and potential treatment of women with UI and suspected endometrial receptivity defects. ",

RESULTS: DMBT1 gene expression was significantly down-regulated (fold change 6.2; p = 0.03) in mid-secretory relative to late proliferative phase endometrium with peak levels of DMBT1 transcript observed in the late proliferative phase immediately prior to the LH surge. Immunohistochemistry localized DMBT1 to the glandular compartment of human proliferative phase endometrium and DMBT1 gene expression showed an estrogen dose dependent increase in both RL95-2 cells and in ovariectomized mice.

INTRODUCTION: PGRMC-1 is a small membrane protein that mediates non-genomic action of Progesterone (P4). However, PGRMC1 has been implicated in a diversity of biological events other than P4 signaling, including apoptosis (1). In humans, PGRMC-1 protein abundance decreases in the receptive endometria (2), but its localization and function remains unknown. Our aim was to describe the protein localization in decidualized and non-decidualized endometrial stromal cells (hESC), to investigate how the overexpression could alter the decidualization process and to investigate the PGRMC1 anti-apoptotic role in endometrial epithelial cells (hEECs). METHODS: Primary hESCs obtained from endometrial biopsies were decidualizated using MPA and cAMP during 3 days. PRL was measured by ELISA to check decidualization and PGRMC1 protein localization was analyzed by immunofluorescence. PGRMC1 overexpression on hESCs primary culture (n=8) was carried by transfection using a pCMV6-AC-GFP plasmid and then hESCs were decidualized. We also analyzed the cytoskeleton reorganization using a F-actin staining with phaloidin, and hEEC apoptosis was measured after PGRMC1 overexpression with In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit. We have previously reported that women with a history of recurrent miscarriage (RM) have altered serum levels of TIMP-2, MMP-2 and RLX-2 in a subsequent pregnancy. In this study, we have developed a 3-dimensional in vitro tissue culture model of the endometrium to investigate the role of TIMP-2, RLX-2 and related molecules in implantation and the pathogenesis of RM and how these molecules influence trophoblast-endometrial interactions. Hypothesis: 3-D in vitro endometrial models that mimic the endometrium in vivo can be used to examine trophoblast-endometrial interactions during early implantation.",

We also examined the offspring of knockout males (N = 10) compared with controls (N = 6) to account for effects of offspring genotype. RESULTS: PAPP-A2 knock-out females were 12% lighter than controls at the time of mating (KO: 20.7 \u00b1 0.4 g vs. controls: 23.5 \u00b1 0.5 g; P < 0.0001), consistent with previous work. All females produced a first litter and PAPP-A2 deletion did not reduce the probability of having a second litter (15/17 KO females vs. 8/14 control females). PAPP-A2 deletion did not have a significant effect on the number of days between mating and the birth of the first litter (KO: 24 \u00b1 2 vs. controls: 27 \u00b1 2), or the number of days between the birth of the first litter and the birth of the second litter (27 \u00b1 1 for both genotypes). Likewise, PAPP-A2 deletion did not affect the number of pups in the first litter (KO: 7.8 \u00b1 0.6 vs. controls: 8.1 \u00b1 0.6) or the second litter (KO: 8.1 \u00b1 0.5 vs. controls: 7.6 \u00b1 0.6). Offspring of female knockouts were significantly lighter than those of control females at birth (KO: 1.32 \u00b1 0.01 g vs. controls: 1.39 \u00b1 0.01 g; P = 0.002) and at 3 weeks of age (KO: 8.3 \u00b1 0.1 g vs. controls: 9.1 \u00b1 0.1 g; P < 0.0001). However, the mass of offspring of male knockouts was also reduced compared with controls at birth (KO: 1.28 \u00b1 0.02 g vs. controls: 1.38 \u00b1 0.02 g; P = 0.01) and at 3 weeks of age (KO: 8.4 \u00b1 0.1 g vs. controls: 8.9 \u00b1 0.1 g; P = 0.003), suggesting that these effects were due to offspring genotype. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that deletion of PAPP-A2 affects the fertility or fecundity of mice, and are examining whether compensatory mechanisms maintain normal ovarian IGFBP-5 levels in PAPP-A2 deletion mice. There is evidence of their reproductive role in ovarian development, folliculogenesis, steroidogenesis and oocyte maturation. We previously reported the role in the mammary tissue of the miR-424(322)/503 cluster on multiple pathways (IGF1R, BCL-2, PI3K-AKT/PKB; Ras-MAPK, TGF-\u03b2). Since these pathways have a role in primordial follicle activation that may lead to premature ovarian failure, we hypothesize a possible interference of this cluster with the ovarian ageing process. The objective of our study was to determine if there is a difference in ovarian ageing morpho-histological markers between knockout mice (Ko) and the wild type (Wt) for the miRNA-424(322)/503 cluster.",

The Ko and Wt groups were subdivided by age (< 1 (A) and >= 1 (B) year old). Ovarian specimens were stained for H&E and 10 microscopic fields per ovary were evaluated for markers of ovarian ageing in the cortex (Cx) (invaginations; thickness; medullar-cortex blurring; follicle number, corpora) and medulla (Md) (stromal fibrosis hyperplasia, and vasculature hyalinization). Statistical analysis used the Student's t-test, Chi square, and ANOVA or Fisher's exact tests applied when appropriate. A P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 57 mice were analyzed [Ko, n=37 (A=24; B=13); Wt, n=20 (A=17; B=3)]. There were no phenotypic differences between the Ko and Wt groups in appearance, size, except for an higher Ko weight noted past the 2nd month. There were no significant differences noted in the morpho-histological assessment for all Cx and Md markers of ageing (p=0.071), and unchanged post age-stratification (p=0.37), between Ko and Wt groups. CONCLUSIONS: There is growing evidence linking miRs to ovarian regulation and development. Even though we did not find a difference in the ovarian morpho-histological markers of ageing in our study, this miR cluster with preferred ovarian granulosa and oocyte expression may have an important role in its function that should be integrated in future research.",

We have shown that H19 negatively regulates the let-7 family of microRNAs, which themselves inhibit gene expression at the posttranscriptional level, and that let-7 can itself bind to and destabilize H19. Moreover, we have shown that estradiol (E2) increases expression of H19 via the AKT signaling pathway in a human granulosa cell line. E2 is known to stimulate PI3K/AKT signaling, and activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling alters phosphorylation of KSRP, a key protein involved in regulating let-7. Thus, the objective of this work is to characterize the mechanisms by which E2 regulates H19/let-7. We propose that E2 activates PI3K/AKT signaling, which alters KSRP protein level and leads to reduced let-7 processing, hence decreasing production of let-7 and increasing level of H19.",

Western blot and immunofluorescence assay were performed to assess changes in KSRP protein levels after treatment with E2. Lastly, H19 RNA stability in the presence of E2 was determined by exposing KGN cells to actinomycin-D (at 5 ug/ml) for 1, 2, and 6 hours after E2 treatment. RESULTS: Extended culture of KGN cells with E2 led to a nearly fivefold downregulation of let-7 (coinciding with an increase in H19) compared to control cells (p<0.05). KSRP expression decreased 2-3-fold 48h following estradiol treatment; this was confirmed by Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that the E2-responsive lncRNA H19, which reduces the bioavailability of let-7 and is itself regulated by let-7, is regulated by E2 via the AKT; specifically via a decrease in KSRP protein level. The finding that E2 regulates the H19/let-7 axis, which is essential for cellular growth and development, opens the door to a more detailed exploration of novel, ncRNA pathways by which estrogen may affect the reproductive tract. This information allows, for the first time, for development of a new theory of follicular development based on E2 stimulation of lncRNA pathways.",

INTRODUCTION: Woman's risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been shown to be associated with her own low birth weight (m-LBW) as well as with low birth weight of her children (c-LBW). Here we determine which of the two mechanisms of CVD dominates. METHODS: Risk of CVD in relation to m-LBW and c-LBW was evaluated in a prospective cohort of 404 women with prior live birth. CVD was a first diagnosis or death due to ischemic heart disease or cerebrovascular accident. Woman's own birth weight <2500g defined m-LBW; c-LBW was birth weight <2500g of at least 1 live born infant. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to evaluate the impact of m-LBW and c-LBW on the risk of CVD. . We estimated risk ratios (RR) for teen pregnancy (<20 years old) using log-binomial models adjusted for age, race, and socioeconomic status, examining the following potential risk factors: gender expression/conformity, identity-related stress [e.g., worry that others might think they are LGB (lesbian, gay, bisexual)], bullying victimization and perpetration, and childhood abuse. Among sexual minorities, we also examined sexual orientation disclosure, LGB community involvement, and developmental milestones (e.g., age first identified as a sexual minority). RESULTS: Our sample included 140 teen pregnancies (2% of participants), of which 45 occurred among sexual minorities (4% of minorities). Bullying perpetration and each of the childhood abuse items were associated with approximately three-fold greater risk of teen pregnancy. Childhood abuse was a stronger risk factor in sexual minorities than in heterosexuals (among sexual minorities, physical abuse multivariable RR=3.13, 95%CI=1.62, 6.02; among heterosexuals, RR=1.90, 95%CI=1.10, 3.77, p-interaction=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: The higher prevalence of teen pregnancy among sexual minorities is driven by established risk factors, particularly childhood abuse, rather than unique risk factors, thus prevention efforts should focus on these factors. Similar trends are seen with hookah use, where as many as 18% of high school seniors use hookah. The goal of this study was to qualitatively assess baseline knowledge and perceptions of pregnant women of e-cigarette and hookah use during pregnancy. A secondary aim was to assess other terms used to refer to e-cigarettes. METHODS: Nine focus groups with pregnant women were conducted following regularly scheduled Centering Pregnancy meetings at 3 distinct clinics in Houston, TX. Ten semi-structured questions facilitated discussion of e-cigarettes and hookah knowledge. A minimum of two facilitators audio recorded and transcribed the sessions which were translated in Spanish as necessary.",

            "text": "This was a prospective cohort study of pregnant women receiving care at an urban, county hospital in 2010-2011. Our primary outcome was lead levels in maternal and umbilical cord blood. Maternal serum specimens were collected during pregnancy; umbilical cord samples were collected at delivery. Pearson's correlation coefficient and univariate linear regression were performed to develop a model of the relationship between maternal and umbilical cord blood lead content. RESULTS: Paired maternal and umbilical cord blood lead samples were obtained for 59 mother-infant pairs. Mean lead in maternal serum was 0.73 ug/dL (range: 0.23 -2.74 ug/dL) and in umbilical cord blood was 0.48 ug/dL (range: 0.1 -1.69 ug/dL). The Pearson's correlation coefficient was 0.93 (p=<0.001). After controlling for maternal birthplace, linear regression demonstrated that for every unit (ug/dL) increase in maternal lead levels, umbilical cord lead levels increased by 0.66 ug/dL (95% CI 0.59-0.72, p <0.001). A maternal lead level of 3.0 ug/dL could therefore predict a cord blood lead level of 2.0 ug/dL. This relationship is described in figure 1. *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong positive correlation between lead found in maternal and umbilical cord blood, even at low levels. This relationship suggests that maternal serum lead content can be used as a proxy for the amount that is delivered through the umbilical cord to the fetus. This information can be used to anticipate the amount of lead a fetus has been exposed to in-utero and identify which newborns need screening for excess lead exposure after birth. ",

In response to community concerns that Spanish-speaking women were vulnerable to follow-up delays following an abnormal cancer screening result, we used medical records review and patient surveys of 477 women to assess differences in delayed follow-up between Spanish and English-speaking patients, controlling for other risk factors for delay such as low patient activation, low health literacy, and distrust of the health care system. In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 stakeholders across the county to explore key process measures assessing the DPNC's role in enhancing delivery of clinical services. RESULTS: Spanish-speaking women had lower health literacy, lower patient activation, and more health care system distrust than their Englishspeaking counterparts. Despite the prevalence of timeliness risk factors, we observed no differences in likelihood of delayed (>60 day) follow-up by language when Spanish-speaking women were assisted by patient navigators. Stakeholder interviews suggested that navigators enhanced clinical services by facilitating patient-provider communications and referrals, particularly by giving clinicians insight into patients' personal circumstances, identifying community resources to address patient concerns, and supplementing information that women received in the clinic. CONCLUSIONS: Patient navigators may play increasingly diverse and impactful roles across the continuum in women's health care delivery, especially for vulnerable populations.

Sensitivity analysis showed that UCBGA was cost-effective in 51.8%, 83.3%, 99.6% & 100% of simulations in years 1,2,3 and 4. These conclusions were not sensitive to wide clinically possible variations in parameter values for neonatal intensive care unit and SCN admissions, magnitude of averted SCN admissions, cumulative delivery numbers, and SCN admission costs. CONCLUSIONS: Universal UCBGA is associated with significant initial and ongoing costs; however, potential averted costs (due to reduced SCN admissions) exceed incurred costs in most scenarios. There was equal distribution of very early (gestational age of < 32 weeks) and early preterm birth (32-33 weeks). However, late preterm birth was significantly greater in the urban surroundings (1% vs 12 %, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: First 24 hrs seem to be the most crucial period of neonatal life in rural surroundings. Poor domiciliary care practices in rural areas could influence the postnatal care of mother as well as the new born. Furthermore, cultural beliefs like feeding sugar and water or honey to the new born, delaying breast feeding (considering colostrum as harmful) could also amplify the effect. Instigating community programs to train local midwives and other providers responsible for newborn care carries potential for positive outcome of neonatal survival.",

RESULTS: Most of the literature focuses mostly on the need for defibulation to allow vaginal delivery and in some cases to allow sexual intercourse. Detailed guidance on the procedures being used has been published. The most frequent delayed complication is epidermal clitoral inclusion cysts. Unfortunately, due to many reasons including ignorance, unfamiliarity, and under-reporting, it is characterized in some reports as a rare or even a very rare complication. Urinary problems are common complication of FGM. Progressive scar shrinkage may result in urethral strictures, urine retention, slow urine streaming, and urinary calculi. Dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia are other typical complications. Finally, there are very few reports on the psychological complications in children and adolescent girls.

AEC also proliferated at all of the bFGF doses, but only reached significance at 100ng/mL (p=0.0561). MTT assay confirmed the effect of bFGF treatment on proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Amniotic cells express bFGFR and are capable of responding to bFGF in vitro. The importance of these data is that although bFGF and its receptor are endogenously expressed in vivo in the amnion, these cells do not proliferate in the third trimester. Thus it is thought that this lack in proliferative capacity may contribute to the weakening of the membranes towards term as the numbers of cells decrease and these cells can not contribute to collagen maintenance. INTRODUCTION: While a higher maternal BMI is associated with preterm birth, it is unclear whether excess gestational weight gain (GWG) or obesity drives increased risk. We and others have shown that the placenta harbors microbiota, which are significantly different among preterm births. Our aim in this study was to investigate whether the preterm placental microbiome varies by virtue of obesity or by excess GWG. METHODS: Placentas (n=320) were collected from term and preterm gravidae. Genomic DNA was extracted and subjected to metagenomic sequencing. Data was analyzed by clinical covariates, including the 2009 Institute of Medicine's GWG guideline and obesity. RESULTS: Analysis of 16S rRNA-based metagenomics revealed no clustering by virtue of obesity (p=0.161). Among gravidae who delivered preterm, there was no clustering by obesity (p=0.480), but there was clustering by excess GWG (p=0.022, Figure 1C ). Among preterm births, detailed analysis identified microbial genera and bacterial metabolic gene pathways that varied among gravidae with excess GWG (Figure 2A , 2B, and 2C). Notably, excess GWG was associated with decreased microbial folate biosynthesis pathways and decreased butanoate metabolism (LDA >3.0-fold, Figure 2D ). ",

Explants treated with LPS + nicotine were not significantly different compared to controls (p>0.05), except for IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1 (p<0.05). Similarly, nicotine treatment alone did not change cytokines compared to controls (p>0.05), except TNF-\u03b1 which was higher (p<0.01). INTRODUCTION: Exposure to prenatal inflammation is associated with both short and long term adverse neurobehavioral outcomes. We have previously demonstrated that low dose intrauterine inflammation (IUI) leads to a specific neuronal insult in the fetal brain that persists through gestation. However, the pathways responsible for mediating this injury have not been elucidated. Without understanding the mechanism of injury, therapeutic approaches cannot begin. Therefore, the objectives of this study were 1) to discover novel immune pathways acutely activated after exposure to IUI; 2) to determine if immune pathways remained activated 48 hours after exposure. METHODS: Timed-pregnant CD-1 mice received an intrauterine injection of lipopolysaccharide (50 \u00b5g/dam, LPS, n=10) or saline (n=10) on E15 of gestation. Six and 48 hours post-injection, placentas (PL) and fetal brains (FB) were harvested. RNA isolated from FB and PL (at 6 hours) was profiled using immune arrays on a microfluidic platform. The most differentially regulated targets in the PL discovered via the array were then investigated at 48 hours at the RNA level by QPCR. Changes in protein expression were assessed in the PL at 6 and 48 hours by ELISA. RESULTS: Immune profiling in the FB revealed altered expression in response to IUI: IL-12\u03b2 was decreased 9-fold (P=0.007), IL-1\u03b2 was increased 3.6 fold (P=0.003) and VEGF-\u03b1 was increased 1.5 fold (P=0.02) compared to controls. In the PL, the expression of 6 inflammatory targets was significantly increased at 6 hours. At 48 hours, the expression of 4 of those targets was still significantly elevated. Protein levels of IL-1\u03b2, CCL3 and CCL5 mirrored the LPS-induced increase in mRNA expression at both 6 and 48 hours. *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Placental chemokine expression is markedly elevated, acutely after intrauterine inflammation and increased expression persists during the time period that fetal neuronal injury is observed. Understanding the role placental chemokines play in fetal brain injury from exposure to prenatal inflammation may lead to new therapeutic strategies.",

We demonstrated that UP adheres to primary fetal membrane cells and induces a strong pro-inflammatory response including interleukin 8 (IL-8), resulting in alteration of metalloproteinase expression and activity including metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9). We also demonstrated that P4 attenuate TNF\u03b1 induced inflammation in fetal membranes. This P4 function is mediated through PGRMC1 which found to be down-regulated in the fetal membranes collected from PPROM patients (our published data). In this study, we investigate the role of P4 and PGRMC1 in inhibiting UP induced proinflammatory response in amnion and chorion cells. METHODS: Primary amnion and chorion cells (8 subjects) were transfected with scramble or validated PGRMC1 siRNA. After transfection (72h), cells were treated with UP at 10 6 cfu for 4h with or without pretreatment with P4 or Ethanol (vehicle) at a dose of 10 -7 M for 1h. Cell lysates were harvested for Western blotting to determine knockdown of PGRMC1 expression. Culture media was harvested for measuring MMP9 activity by zymography. IL-8, MMP9 and cyclooxygenase (COX-2) mRNA expression were quantified by real time PCR. RESULTS: IL-8, COX-2, MMP9 mRNA level and MMP9 activity are significantly higher in UP infected cells except MMP9 mRNA level in chorion cell was no difference compared to control group. IL-8 and COX-2 in response to UP stimulation were significantly accelerated in the PGRMC1 knockdown chorion cells compared with scramble siRNA group but not in amnion cells. The up-regulation of IL-8 and COX-2 by UP exposure was partially inhibited by P4 pretreatment and the inhibition was lost in PGRMC1 knock-down chorion cells with statistical significance but not in amnion cells. The effects of P4 and PGRMC1 on MMP9 are not significant. CONCLUSIONS: P4 inhibited UP induced IL-8 and COX-2 in chorion cells mediated by PGRMC1. However, the function of PGRMC1 in this process can be independent on P4. This indicates they function through separate, but overlapping signaling pathways. PGRMC1 is critical for balancing the inflammatory response of chorion cells to UP infection but not amnion cells. The regulation of MMP9 expression and activity might be deferent mechanism. Cytokines and chemokines are thought to be involved in the preparation of various tissues for onset of labor. The aim of this study was to determine the changes of pro-inflammatory, antiinflammatory and chemokines in placenta, decidua, myometrium and fetal membrane tissues of women in labor vs. not in labor.",

INTRODUCTION: Premature cervical remodeling is likely an obligatory step in the pathogenesis of spontaneous preterm birth. An inflammatory challenge to cervical epithelial cells has been shown to increase production of cytokines and disrupt the epithelial barrier leading to cervical remodeling. Statins have been shown to prevent cervical remodeling by inhibiting complement activation and increasing HO-1 gene expression leading to carbon monoxide production. We hypothesize treating cervical epithelial cells with statins or a carbon monoxide releasing molecule would mitigate inflammatory induced functional changes to the cervical epithelial barrier. METHODS: Immortalized ectocervical (ECTO) and endocervical (ENDO) cells were plated at a concentration of 9.6 x 10 4 per well for 24 hours. Cells were treated with 20ug/ml of Pravastatin (PRAV) or 30uM of the carbon monoxide releasing molecule tricarbonylchloro(glycinato) ruthenium III (CORM2) for 2 hours prior to treatment with 25ug/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Media was collected at 6 and 24 hours. The cytokine IL6 was assessed at both time points. The effect of LPS, PRAV, LPS + PRAV, CORM2, or LPS + CORM2 on the integrity of the epithelial cell barrier was assessed using an in vitro permeability assay. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that in utero inflammation causes long-term effects on hippocampal synaptic transmission and long term synaptic plasticity (LTP).",

By plotting the initial slopes of fEPSPs against the FV amplitudes, we determined the input-output (I/O) ratio for CA3-CA1 synapses, a measure of synaptic strength. To determine the probability of presynaptic release, a paired pulse facilitation (PPF) stimulus protocol was used. Field LTP of CA3-CA1 neurotransmission was induced by stimulating CA3 axons with 3 sets of 100 stimuli delivered at 50 Hz. Statistical significance was determined by Mann-Whitney test or Student's T-test. RESULTS: Compared to controls, offspring mice that were exposed displayed increased synaptic strength, a higher I/O ratio (0.17\u00b10.02, n=11 control; 0.55\u00b10.13, n=11 LPS; p<0.05). The paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) ratio in LPS exposed mice compared to controls was reduced (1.6\u00b10.2, n=2 control; 1.1\u00b10.0, n=7 LPS, p<0.02). Decreased LTP was observed in LPS exposed mice compared to saline controls (159\u00b18.8, n=4 control; 124.9\u00b110.7, n=5 LPS; p<0.04). CONCLUSIONS: LPS exposed mice displayed increased synaptic strength that can be explained by an increase in the probability of glutamate release from pre-synaptic fibers, as evidenced by the reduced PPF ratio. LPS exposed mice also had lower levels of LTP compared to controls. This finding could be due to disrupted AMPA receptor trafficking in CA1 neurons, similar to ischemia-induced impairment of LTP. These novel findings of changes in hippocampal synaptic transmission may underlie the cognitive and behavioral deficits observed in survivors of preterm birth. ",

Supported by PO1HD054713. We evaluated IL-6 and receptors changes in fetal membranes (FM) in response to diverse microbial type and load. METHODS: FM collected from normal term (n=6), not in labor, were maintained in an organ explant system and treated with heat inactivated Mycoplasma hominis (MH), Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU), Gardnerella vaginalis (GV) and combinations of CFUs: MH+UU(10 6 ), MH+UU+GV(10 6 ), MH+UU(10 6 )+GV(10 3 ), MH+UU(10 3 )+GV(10 6 ) for 24h to simulate PIAC. IL-6 and sIL-6R supernatants were measured by Multiplex assay. mIL-6R and gp130 expressions were evaluated by qPCR. Data were analyzed by linear mixed effects models. RESULTS: Stimulation by UU or GV alone and all polymicrobial combinations increased IL-6 (p<0.05, 0.01 and 0.05 respectively) compared to control. Highest dose of GV combination had the maximum IL-6 levels. MH alone had no effect on IL-6 and receptors. UU alone or combined with MH increased sIL-6R (p<0.01). GV alone or with Mycoplasmas didn't change sIL-6R. GV treatment increased mIL-6R and gp130 expressions (p<0.001); but, combined with Mycoplasmas didn't change either. CONCLUSIONS: Mono and polymicrobial treatment of FM produced distinct IL-6 signaling response. Increased IL-6 and sIL-6R by genital Mycoplasmas indicated inflammation; but, lack of mIL-6R or gp130 reflects limited IL-6 biofunction. GV produced proinflammatory IL-6 signaling that was curtailed in the presence of Mycoplasmas suggesting an anti-inflammatory milieu created to minimize IL-6 biofunction by other pathogens. Bacterial species, load and combinations determine IL-6 response. Predict pregnancy outcome and design interventions based on IL-6 levels without consider other signaling molecules may be ineffective. Preterm birth is believed to be a final common pathway of a multitude of factors, and it is clear inflammation plays a significant role in prematurity. However, the precise mechanisms of preterm parturition remain elusive. Normally, bacteria are not present in amniotic fluid. If bacteria gain access to the amniotic space, an inflammatory response may ensue in cells present in the amniotic fluid, specifically amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells. This study sought to assess if an inflammatory challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) altered signal transduction pathways in these cells.",

Mice that are genetically deficient in HO-1 have increased fetal wastage and low birth weight that is reversed by the enzyme's product, carbon monoxide. HO-1 is controlled by the transcription factor nrf-2. Studies with other culture systems have shown that trigonelline, a component of coffee, inhibits nrf-2 activity but its effects on the placenta are unknown.

Luminex analysis of cytokines in supernatants showed that LPS stimulated a robust IL-8 response but only small increases in IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and GM-CSF, all of which exhibited dose-dependent inhibition by BBG (Figure) . CONCLUSIONS: LPS leads to increases in cytokine expression and apoptosis. Inhibition with BBG shows a dose-dependent reduction in expression of NOS1, activated caspase 3, cytokins and apoptosis. While the role of P2RX7 in IL-1\u03b2 release is well characterized, inhibition of IL-8 suggests a wider role for P2RX7 in immune pathways. Additional studies with extended LPS stimulation are needed to understand the role of P2RX7 in the temporal regulation of endothelial cell activation. * Figure(s) NF-\u03baB controls the expression of contraction associated and inflammatory response genes and is activated in amnion and myometrium in labour. A strong association exists between inflammation/ infection and preterm labour. Furthermore, the presence of inflammation is an independent risk factor for adverse neonatal outcome. We have previously shown that 15-deoxy-D 12,14 PGJ2 (15dPGJ2) inhibits IL-1\u03b2 induced NF-\u03baB activation and COX-2 levels in amniocytes, myocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and pro-inflammatory cytokine production in PBMCs. In addition, when given to LPS treated mice, 15dPGJ2 is able to both delay preterm labour and increase pup survival.",

THP-1 cells were also exposed to live GB37 (10:1 bacteria per cell x 24 h) and supernatants were analyzed by ELISA for IL-8, IL-10, MCP-1, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2. Human gestational membrane (GM) transwells were treated on the choriodecidual side for 24 h with 0.5 e6 CFU GB37 and supernatants were analyzed by EIA for PGE 2 . Timed-pregnant female C57BL/6J mice were vaginally colonized on day13 of pregnancy (E13) with 10 9 CFU/ ml of GBS (10/84) or vehicle control. Dams were sacrificed on E15 and amniotic fluid collected for PGE 2 quantification. RESULTS: GB37 stimulated PGE 2 production into the choriodecidual chamber of GM transwell cultures. Furthermore, in mice, we observed increased PGE 2 in amniotic fluid following ascending GBS infection. PGE 2 significantly suppressed phagocytosis of heat killed GB37 in both THP-1 cells and PMs. PGE 2 significantly increased IL-8 and IL-1\u03b2 production, and decreased MCP-1 and TNF-\u03b1 production from infected macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates increases in PGE 2 production in an in vitro and in vivo model of GBS CAM. In addition, we observed significant changes in human macrophage responses to GBS infection following treatment with PGE 2 . These findings suggest that PGE 2 signaling regulates innate immune defenses in the pathogenesis of CAM.

Somatosensory cortex was derived from offspring male mice on postnatal days (PND) 30 and 90 at time-specific points in the day. We performed QPCR for message expression of circadian rhythm genes: CLOCK (circadian locomotor output cycles kaput), MTNR1A/1B (melatonin receptor 1A and B), GRIN1 (glutamate receptor subunit zeta-1, CRH (corticotropin releasing hormone), GABRA1 (gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit alpha-1), DBP (D site of albumin promoter binding protein), PRNP (major prion protein) and PER2 (period circadian protein homolog 2). The protein products of these genes were utilized in ELISA for confirmation of changes in mRNA. In addition, melatonin levels in somatosensory cortex were investigated with ELISA. Student t-tests were run with significance set at p<0.05. RESULTS: On a protein level, ELISA revealed an increased level of melatonin in LPS-treated male mice between 2 and 4 pm, an abnormal finding not present in controls (p<0.05). *Figure(s) will be available online.

CONCLUSIONS: This study did not identify a difference between the traditional latency antibiotics regimen including erythromycin and alternative regimens including azithromycin. Further study is needed to confirm this result. During cervical ripening, HA deposition is increased in the stromal matrix, epithelial pericellular matrix and in cervical mucus. HA depletion in the cervix results in inappropriate differentiation of the cervico-vaginal epithelia, and a striking increase in preterm birth rates in a mouse model of ascending vaginal infection. However it is unknown how HA depletion leads to impaired epithelia and mucus function.

The expression and contribution of HA-binding partners CD44 and versican was evaluated in wild type and CD44 null mice. RESULTS: HA knockdown with siRNA decreased HA production 60-70% and increased ECT-1 cell permeability significantly compared to control group. Compared to WT, the microparticles moved deeper into the mucosal layer in the HA KO, appearing closer to epithelia suggesting that HA within the cervico-vaginal mucus plays a role in mucosal barrier protection from pathogens. CD44 expression was confined to the nonmucosal epithelia while versican was expressed throughout the epithelia. In contrast to the HA KO, epithelial differentiation and mucus vacuole structures of the CD44 KO appear similar to WT. The HA binding proteoglycan versican is expressed in the epithelia similar to HA expression suggesting a role in epithelial function with HA. CONCLUSIONS: Hyaluronan secreted by the epithelia during late pregnancy plays key roles in barrier function that are critical for protection against pathogen invasion and resulting preterm birth. Both CD44 and versican are expressed in the cervical epithelia and may serve as bindingpartners with HA to regulate epithelial functions. Table. IL-10 levels are greater (55-65% of total cytokines) in non-pregnant and pregnant cervices compared with other cytokines (P<0.05). IL-4 levels were always lower (P<0.05). On GD 10, nearly all cytokines are lower compared to nonpregnant rats (P<0.05). From GD 10 to GD 20, levels of IL-17, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-r and TNF-\u03b1 significantly increase (P<0.05). Conversely, levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines ( IL-4 and IL-10) decrease on GD 20 compared to GD 14. Thus, generally proinflammatory cytokines decrease in early GD then increase in the cervix during late GD, except for IL-1 and IL-2, whereas anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) increase on GD 14 then decrease on GD 20.",

Normal AF volume is maintained by intramembranous (IM) transport of AF across the amnion; and aquaporins (AQPs) has been shown to modulate this IM transport. Recently, AQPs 1, 3, 8 and 9 have been described in human amnion and may play a role in amnion function. We hypothesized that alterations in amniotic fluid transport could be linked with abnormal expression of AQPs in human fetal membranes. Belonging to a family of 13 members (noted AQP0 to AQP12), aquaporins (AQPs) play a major role in regulating water homeostasis of the organism. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the expression profiles of AQPs on human fetal membranes from diabetic pregnancies. METHODS: 129 amniotic membranes were collected at term from normal, type 1 (insulin dependent), type 2 (insulin independent) pregnancies and gestational diabetes.A differential AQPs expression profile (qualitative and quantitative) at transcriptional and protein level were established of these membranes.

The choroid plexuses are small brain ventricular organs producing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that constantly bathes the brain. These organs differentiate early, just after neural closure and have in recent years the plexus has been shown to have a much more active role in brain development than previously appreciated thereby it can influence both neurogenesis and neural migration by secreting factors into the CSF, regulating the internal environment of the growing brain. Still, much of choroid plexus developmental function is still unclear.

            "text": "The number of unique transcripts decreased during normal development and the majority of differentially expressed transcripts were down-regulated through development suggesting a more complex and active plexus earlier in fetal development. The functional annotation indicated changes across widespread biological functions in normal plexus development. In particular we find age-dependent regulation of genes associated with annotation categories: Gene Expression, Cardiovascular System Development, Nervous System Development and Molecular Transport. Longer durations of MNR resulted in more changes to the transcriptome and were mostly associated to carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism with methionine and histidine pathways significantly enriched. Particularly of significance to plexus function is that Na-K-2Cl co-transporter (SLC12A2), a key transporter for CSF secretion, was strongly down-regulated following MNR. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations support the idea that the choroid plexus has roles in shaping brain development and suggests that MNR during pregnancy could change important choroid plexus functions. Supported by NICHD HD 21350. Information about mothers' meal frequency and maternal diet was obtained from a validated self-reported food frequency questionnaire answered in mid-pregnancy. Using principal component analysis, three meal patterns were found; \"main meal pattern\", \"snack pattern\", and \"evening meal pattern\". Information on gestational age at delivery was obtained from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway and preterm delivery was defined as birth before 37 weeks of gestation. RESULTS: After adjustments for covariates (maternal age, pre pregnancy BMI, height, parity, total energy intake, maternal education, marital status, smoking, income and previously preterm delivery), there was a trend towards lower risk for preterm delivery when following a \"main meal pattern\", which included eating breakfast, lunch and dinner regularly, p for trend 0.025. After additional adjustments for meal frequency and fiber intake, glycemic load was associated with late preterm delivery in the whole group, hazard ratio for the highest vs. lowest quartile of 1.25 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.56). A positive trend for an increased risk of preterm delivery with increased glycemic load in older women (age > 35 years) was indicated (p = 0.089). High intake of dietary fibers was associated with a significantly reduced risk of preterm delivery in younger women (age <= 35 years) with hazard ratio for the highest vs. lowest quartile of 0.85 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.98), p-for trend 0.027. For obese women (BMI > 30) a trend of reduced risk of preterm delivery with increased fiber intake was indicated, p-for trend 0.059. CONCLUSIONS: Eating regular meals throughout the day were associated with a trend towards lower risk of preterm delivery. The significant association of various measures of glycemic properties with different subgroups of the study population and for different subgroups of preterm delivery indicate the importance of maternal diet for infant health and need further investigation to be fully understood.

Dimensions of the maternal vasculature were defined from photographs using Bersoft image software. Second order radial uterine arteries feeding the placenta were pressurized, pre-constricted with phenylephrine in the presence of L-NNA and indomethacin. The diameter responses to ACh (0.01-10 \u00b5M) were assessed in arteries of WC and GK rats. RESULTS: Levels of blood glucose during GTT were significantly higher in GK vs. WC rats (maximal 193 \u00b1 16 vs. 87 \u00b1 7 mg/dL). The number of fetuses was reduced from 15.4 \u00b1 0.6 to 10.4 \u00b1 0.6 and fetal resorption rate was increased from 0.4/rat to 2.2/rat in diabetes. Total fetal mass was much lower in GK (25.5 \u00b1 1.2 g) vs. WC (36.9 \u00b1 1.2 g) rats; placentas were heavier in GK (0.455 \u00b1 0.01g) vs. WC (0.413 \u00b1 0.01g).

CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 diabetes in pregnant Goto Kakizaki rats is associated with significant impairment of maternal vascular growth and reduced endothelium-mediated vasodilation. This vascular maladaptation most likely contributes to reduced maternal uterine blood flow and an increase in fetal demise in pregnancies complicated by type 2 diabetes. in the NPH group). There were no differences between the two groups with respect to maternal characteristics. The live birth rate was 95% in the IDet group (2 fetal demises at 10 and 20 weeks) and 100% in the NPH group. There were no significant differences between groups with respect to any of the perinatal outcomes examined (Table 1) . . This is not endorsed by the NICHD or ACOG due to the expected increase in prevalence of GDM (\u00b318%) with no demonstrated improvement in outcome. We sought to determine the impact of using the 1-step method on the prevalence of GDM in a diverse racial population. METHODS: A retrospective cohort was performed using lab data from 1/2008-12/2013 of patients screened for GDM. The 1-step method was used by providers from 1/2011-10/2012 and GDM was diagnosed if \u00b31 of 3 values on the GTT was abnormal (fasting \u226592, 1 hour \u00b3180, or 2 hour \u00b3153mg/dL). In the remaining time, the 2-step method was used, beginning with a 50g 1-hour glucose challenge test (GCT); if \u00b3130mg/ dL, a 100g 3-hour GTT followed. GDM was diagnosed if any value was \u2265 95, 180, 155, or 140 mg/dL at fasting, 1, 2, and 3 hours. The overall and race-specific prevalence of GDM was determined for the 1 and 2-step methods (using either \u00b31 or \u00b32 abnormal GTT values). RESULTS: 4,179 women had a screen; 1,600 underwent a 2-hour GTT and 142 (8.9%) were diagnosed with GDM. The 2-step method was used in 2,579 women: 592 (23.0%) had a positive GCT followed by a 3-hour GTT. GDM was diagnosed in 103 (4.0%) using \u00b32 abnormal values, and in 184 women (7.1%) using \u00b31 abnormal values. See Table 1 . ",

The preservation of mitochondrial respiration by miR-143 overexpression highlights the role of miR-143 in mediation of metabolic reprogramming towards glycolysis in A2GDM placentae. RESULTS: Compared to controls, IGF1, IGFBP1 and IGFBP2 gene expression was found to be significantly under-expressed in placentae of GDM group on diet (n=23) and in those on metformin (n=23) but not in those taking insulin (n=15). There was no difference in placental IGF2 expression. IGF1, IGFBP1 and 2 genes were significantly hypermethylated in women on diet only but not women on metformin or insulin *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Placental expression of IGFs and their binding proteins differ in pregnancies affected by GDM. Down regulation of IGF1 expression in GDM on diet and metformin group but not on insulin may suggest an endocrine role of insulin in normalising altered IGF1 expression in diabetic placenta. Significant hypermethylation in women only on diet but not on metformin or insulin raises the question of role of metformin and insulin in regulating methylation. Whether these alterations contribute to neonatal phenotype or accompany other pathogenetic mechanisms requires further investigation. We analyzed the differences in baseline characteristics between GDM diagnosed patients utilizing these two paradigms: ACOG 2-step approach of screening followed by diagnostic testing, the ADA recommendation of 1-step diagnostic testing.",

CONCLUSIONS: Individuals diagnosed with GDM using the 1-step group began pregnancy with lower weights than those in the two step group, confirming more subtle degrees of dysglycemia are detected with the 1-step approach.

(GD 30) . At GD 165 (0.9 gestation), placentas were collected and microvillous plasma membrane vesicles (MVM) were isolated. MVM System A and system L AA transport capacity was determined in vitro using radiolabeled substrates and rapid filtration techniques. In vivo transplacental AA transport was assessed by infusing a cocktail of nine 13 C or 2 H labeled essential amino acids (EAAs) as a bolus into the maternal circulation at the time of cesarean section. Fetal/maternal mean plasma enrichment ratio for each EAA was calculated. RESULTS: The activity of system A and system L was significantly reduced by 73% and 84% respectively (P<0.01) in MVM isolated from baboon placentas at GD 165 following MNR. Preliminary in vivo data suggests that the fetal/maternal plasma enrichment ratio for leucine, isoleucine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan and lysine was reduced in MNR pregnancies. CONCLUSIONS: Placental transport has not been adequately examined in pregnancies subjected to undernutrition, and this is the first study to investigate placental AA transport in a nonhuman primate model of MNR. We provide direct evidence that the down-regulation of system A and system L activity in MVM isolated from the placenta of MNR baboons leads to decreased transplacental AA transport capacity and consequently reduced amino acid concentrations in the fetal circulation. This is likely a key mechanism linking maternal undernutrition to reduced fetal growth.",

SIRT1 has been called a ''reverse thrifty gene'' that protects against metabolic diseases by directing the organism to limit energy consumption and expenditure. SIRT1 activators have been suggested as a potential treatment for Type 2 diabetes. We aimed to characterize SIRT1 expression in placentas of normal and GDM pregnancies and to determine the role of SIRT1 in the regulation of nutrient transport proteins in vitro. METHODS: Human term placentas were obtained at delivery from women whose pregnancies were normal (n=15) or complicated by GDM and controlled by diet (n=15). Gene expression for SIRT1, fatty acid transporter proteins FATP1-6, glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and amino acid transporters (SNAT1, 2, 4 and ASCT 1 and 2) were examined by real-time PCR and SIRT1 protein was localised by immunohistochemistry in human placental tissues. SIRT1 activity was inhibited in HTR-8 cells (first trimester trophoblast cell line) with vehicle, 2\u00b5M, 6\u00b5M or 10\u00b5M Ex-527 (SIRT1 inhibitor) treatment for 24 and 48 hours (n=3). RESULTS: SIRT1 mRNA expression was higher in villous placenta compared to other gestational tissues with no difference between placentas collected after labour vs elective Caesarean section. SIRT1 mRNA and protein expressions were down-regulated in term placentas from pregnancies complicated with GDM (p<0.0001). SIRT1 inhibition had no effect on cell viability in HTR-8 cells, but resulted in up-regulation of fatty acid transporter proteins FATP2 (p<0.01), FATP4 (p<0.05) and GLUT4 (p<0.01) after 24 hours and down-regulation of FATP6 (p<0.05), amino acid transporters SNAT2 (p<0.01) and ASCT1 (p<0.05) gene expressions after 48 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Our data implicate a role for SIRT1 in the pathogenesis of GDM and in the regulation and nutrient transporter proteins in human placenta.The need for improved medical treatments to both prevent and treat GDM is becoming increasingly apparent. Manipulation of SIRT1 may constitute a novel future approach for the treatment of GDM. Our study aimed to create a nomogram for expected physiologic changes in UP for PD throughout gestation.

METHODS: Maternal and cord blood was collected immediately following delivery, snap frozen and stored at -80\u00b0C until use. Serum FT3, FT4 and TSH was analyzed using ELISA. Subjects were categorized by pre-pregnancy or first trimester BMI into 5 categories: Normal weight (18.5-24.9, N=43); Overweight (25.0-29.9, N=51); Obese 1 (30.0-34.9, N=52); Obese 2 (35.0-39.9, N=37); Obese 3 (\u226540.0, N=22).

As expected, early pregnancy BMI was positively associated with maternal leptin levels at baseline and in late pregnancy (all p < 0.001), and was inversely associated with the ALR (p < 0.001). Likewise, maternal weight gain was positively associated with higher maternal leptin levels (p < 0.002) and decreased ALR (P<0.02). See * Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal insulin sensitivity as measured by the ALR is positively-associated with higher maternal DHA levels. Future studies will be necessary to determine whether maternal DHA supplementation translates into improved insulin sensitivity. Mothers were bred at postnatal day (PND) 120 and ate pregnancy diet until weaning. OFF ate C diet from weaning. Male OFF were euthanized at 110, 450 and 650 PND -n = 5-7 males from different litters per group. Serum and liver were obtained. We determined offspring serum and liver malondialdehyde (MDA-spectometry) liver reactive oxygen species (ROS -spectrofluorometry) and superoxide dismutase activity (SOD -activity by xanthinoxidase). RESULTS: As MO OFF age, serum and liver MDA increased earlier (Figs 1A and B) as did ROS (Fig 1C) while liver SOD decreased earlier than in OFF of control mothers. *Figure(s) will be available online. Nonalcoholic fatty liver reflects hepatic insulin resistance and is a key feature of metabolic syndrome. There is little known about the impact of maternal nonalcoholic fatty liver disease on fetal growth. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate the association of early elevated ALT with large for gestational age birthweight. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis from a nested case-control study of ALT values measured between 8-18 weeks and subsequent gestational diabetes (GDM). We included women with singleton gestations and without known diabetes, liver disease or moderate self-reported alcohol use during pregnancy. We used inverse probability weighting to standardize the population and minimize selection bias. We calculated population-based birthweight z scores and defined LGA as at or above the 90%ile. We compared baseline characteristics with either ANOVA, Fisher's exact test or Wilcoxon rank sum. Covariates were identified by univariate regression analysis. We then performed conditional logistic regression to evaluate the relationship between either ALT\u226590%ile or logALT and LGA adjusting for maternal age, BMI, parity, GDM, smoking and maternal weight gain.",

Women were further analyzed by the number of cigarettes smoked/day: <1, 1-4, 5-9, \u00b310. Outcomes included a primary composite (severe pregnancy associated hypertension (PAH) or mild PAH with severe features), preeclampsia, PAH, abruption, preterm birth, low birth weight (LBW), and small for gestational age (SGA). Tests for trend and multivariable logistic regression adjusting for maternal age, randomization gestational age, race/ ethnicity, body mass index, education, vitamin use, previous pregnancy (< 20 weeks), alcohol use and treatment assignment were performed. RESULTS: 9,969 women were analyzed. Smoking prevalence was 15.6%.

Medically indicated deliveries were determined by criteria set forth in the 39-Week Toolkit as outlined by ACOG, the National Quality Forum and the Joint Commission. Neonatal admissions were also analyzed. Chi square and t-test were used to assess the data. RESULTS: There were 545 patients in the study group (post-initiative) and 520 in the control group (pre-initiative). In the study group there were 4 patients versus 42 patients in the control group (p<0.0001) delivered between 37/0 and 38/6 weeks without an indication. There were 0 transfers to the NICU in the study group versus 5 in the control group (p<0.022) for non-medically indicated deliveries between 37/0 and 38/6 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: After implementation of the 39 Week Toolkit, nonmedically indicated early term deliveries at our hospital were significantly reduced. This indicates that implementation of standard scheduling procedures contributes to reduce early term elective deliveries. with \u03b1-agonists to maintain systolic blood pressure (SBP). The uterine vasculature is more sensitive to \u03b1-adrenergic vasoconstriction than the systemic vasculature, and this is greater in HTN women, thereby increasing the risk for decreased uteroplacental perfusion and fetal acidosis. We determined the incidence of maternal Hypot during CD with spinal RA, need for maternal PT with \u03b1-agonists, and occurrence of abnormal umbilical arterial blood gases and need for NICU care in a large inborn population. METHODS: Medical records of 1002 women undergoing CD with RA in 2011 and their neonates were reviewed. Hypot was defined as a SBP <100 mmHg or \u00b320% fall in SBP and was stratified by the \u03b1-agonist received (Hypot+ephedrine (E), Hypot+phenylephrine (PE), Hypot+E+PE) and no PT. Data were analyzed by C 2 , Mann Whitney U, or Kruskal-Wallis. RESULTS: 677 (68%) women with CD and RA had Hypot and were more likely (P<0.001) to have HTN (23% vs. 10%), delivery <37wk (16% v 6%) and higher pre-induction SBP vs. admission SBP (135\u00b10.17[SD] vs 127\u00b10.12 mmHg). 76% (n=516) of Hypot received PT; if SBP fell <100 mmHg, they were 4.5-fold more likely to receive PT (42% vs 9%) vs. a 20% fall in SBP. Neonates delivered of Hypot women were ~3-times more likely to require intensive care (11% vs. 4%, P<0.001). Moreover, umbilical artery pH was lower in neonates of Hypot women requiring E+PE vs. those delivered of nonHypot women (7.18\u00b10.11 vs. 7.24\u00b10.06, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Women at-risk for Hypot after RA for CD are more likely to be HTN, deliver preterm, and have SBP fall to <100 mmHg at CD. Their neonates require NICU care, and if PT includes both pressors, they are at risk for abnormal umbilical artery blood gases at birth. The association between maternal Hypot, increased sensitivity to adrenergic agonists and need for PT increases the risk for fetal acidosis-hypoxia; thus, an alternative PT with less uteroplacental effects should be considered.",

However, among women who smoked during pregnancy, SSRI use predicted a 50% increased risk of LBW and an inch decrement in birth length, with a significant (p<.05) interaction effect for length in controlled regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: While this study has limitations, findings preliminarily point to yet another risk of pregnancy smoking with a potentially synergistic effect in an already at-risk population. While further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore potential mechanisms and long term effects, these results suggest that smoking status should be considered when weighing the potential risks and benefits of SSRI use during pregnancy.",

The JC, IOM and ACGME all recommend creation of patient safety programs and team training. Over the past 5 years, our Department submitted 24 events for Quality Reviews and 2 sentinel events in 2013. This study aims to improve teamwork culture in a Labor and Delivery (L&D) Unit through simulation-based interprofessional training at an Academic hospital without prior history of such programs. METHODS: Baseline teamwork attitudes (TA) were assessed by a survey validated by the Department of Defense's TeamSTEPPS (TS) program. A TS curriculum, incorporating teamwork-centered postpartum hemorrhage simulations, was developed and conducted for nursing (RN), residents (res), and attendings (Attd). The TA survey was repeated immediately after the training as well as 3 Mth (months) later. Acute decision making efficiency and outcome measures were followed for 6 Mths. RESULTS: 12 training sessions conducted over 2 days engaged 93 L&D RNs, 26 res & 17 Attd. Significant improvements were seen in NICU admissions for unplanned cesarean (2% from 7%, SE +/-3%) and maternal length of stay (2.45 from 3.61, SE +/-0.36). MD attitudes towards leadership importance increased by 6% and were sustained at 3 months. There were no significant differences in efficiency parameters including time from OR arrival to incision, incision to delivery, QBL or apgars. After 3 mth, >90% of both RN and MD staff indicated that they applied what they had learned in the training. 90% of providers expressed enhanced understanding of managing critical events. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased maternal length of stay and NICU admissions represent improved teamwork and overall nursing-physician communication. Adverse outcomes overall are rare events and require more time and ongoing periodic training to demonstrate significant changes. Simulation for teaching teamwork skills was well received by MD and RN staff. Leadership parameters particularly for physicians were impacted. Based on this program a similar program directed at emergency cesarean has been initiated at the County affiliate. This project may serve as a template for programs interested in improving teamwork culture on academic L&D units. The risk of fetal death for those remaining undelivered (FDRRe) has been shown to exceed the neonatal death rate (NDR) in low risk pregnancies after 37 wks gestational age (GA).

METHODS: Linked birth and infant death data for non-anomalous singleton pregnancies between 2003-2005 from the U.S. NCHS were analyzed. Those with pre-existing maternal medical conditions (other than DM or CHTN), age \u00b335 years, and those delivered <34 wks GA were excluded. Data were stratified by DM, CHTN, or those without either diagnosis (low risk; LR).

INTRODUCTION: At birth, there is a shift in metabolic profile of the heart from glycolytic to oxidative. The regulatory mechanisms of this shift are very little understood and there is an urgent need for new information that will inform the treatment of hearts with common birth complications like pulmonary atelectasis where desaturated arterial blood leads to decreased contractile capacity. Meis1 is a transcription factor that maintains glycolysis in hematopoietic stem cells (HTCs) through its regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1). If Meis1 is knocked down, the HTCs oxygen consumption through oxidative phosphorylation is increased. We hypothesized that fetal cardiac Meis1/HIF1\u03b1 expression would decrease in fetal sheep cardiomyocytes with gestational age as the myocardium prepared to augment its workload at birth in a high oxygen environment. METHODS: RNA expression and protein levels of Meis1 and HIF1\u03b1 was assayed in left ventricular cardiac tissue from fetal (90-95 and 135 days of gestation), neonatal (7-12 days) and adult sheep by qRT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Metabolic measurements were performed on primary cultured cardiomyocytes (100 and 135 days of gestation) with the Seahorse metabolism analyzer. RESULTS: Meis1 expression decreased with fetal age (P<0.01, 90 vs. 135d, n=4-5) and decreased further postnatally (P<0.05, neonate vs. adult n=4-5) *Figure(s) will be available online.",

Meis1 will be a target for improving oxygen utilization in premature myocardium. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is the key regulator of fetal growth. IGF-I bioavailability is strongly influenced by IGF-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) phosphorylation, which increases affinity of IGFBP-1 for IGF-I resulting in decreased bioavailability. IUGR is associated with IGFBP-1 hyperphosphorylation in circulation and liver, the primary source of fetal IGFBP-1, suggesting that IGFBP-1 hyperphosphorylation plays an important role in the development of IUGR. However, the mechanisms underlying IGFBP-1 hyperphosphorylation in IUGR remain unknown. IUGR is characterized by decreased amino acid availability, which activates the amino acid response (AAR) and inhibits mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. We hypothesized that inhibition of mTOR signaling and AAR activation increase IGFBP-1 secretion and phosphorylation in response to amino acid deprivation.",

Alternatively, cells were transfected with siRNA to alter mTOR/AAR signaling. 24 hours later cells were cultured with/without leucine for additional 72 hours. IGFBP-1 secretion and phosphorylation was determined using phosho-S101, S119 and S169 IGFBP-1 antibodies and mass spectrometry (MRM MS). ANOVA, Dunnet's Multiple Comparison Post-Test was used (n=3). RESULTS: Leucine deprivation alone or combined with mTOR inhibition decreased mTORC1 (p70-S6K(T389), -60%) and mTORC2 (pAkt(S473), -70%) activity while inducing IGFBP-1 secretion (+200%). mTOR inhibition increased IGFBP-1 phosphorylation (+200%) but was less pronounced than in leucine deprivation alone (+1100%). Activation of mTORC1+C2 attenuated leucine deprivation-induced IGFBP-1 secretion but not phosphorylation. Conversely, inhibition of AAR prevented both IGFBP-1 secretion and phosphorylation in response to leucine deprivation. CONCLUSIONS: mTOR and AAR independently regulate IGFBP-1 secretion and phosphorylation.

INTRODUCTION: Maternal obesity is associated with numerous pregnancy complications, including intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and alterations in uterine artery function. A reduction in utero-placental blood flow is an important cause of IUGR; obesity-mediated changes in uterine artery function may reduce placental perfusion, leading to IUGR. We hypothesise that in murine pregnancy, consumption of a high fat diet will reduce fetal growth, which will be associated with altered uterine artery vascular reactivity, in particular a reduction in endothelium dependent vasodilation. Sildenafil citrate, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, potentiates vasodilation of blood vessels in the pelvis. We further hypothesise that treatment with sildenafil citrate during pregnancy will normalise uterine artery function and increase pup growth. METHODS: C57BL/6J female mice were fed normal diet (ND, 4% energy from fat) or a high fat diet (HFD, 45% energy from fat) for at least 6 weeks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy. Dams from both diet groups were randomised to treatment with sildenafil citrate from 12.5 days gestation or no treatment. At gestational day 18.5, fetal and placental growth was measured and uterine artery function assessed using wire myography. RESULTS: Consumption of HFD significantly reduced pup weight (ND control vs HFD control 1.09 \u00b1 0.02 vs 0.89 \u00b1 0.09 g; p=0.003), while sildenafil treatment was associated with an increase in fetal weight in both groups (ND control vs ND + SC: 1.09 \u00b1 0.02 vs 1.16 \u00b1 0.01 g, HFD control vs HFD +SC: 0.89 \u00b1 0.09 vs 0.98 \u00b1 0.03 g; p=0.03). There was no difference in maximum constriction of uterine arteries to phenylephrine. Maximum relaxation in response to endothelium dependent vasodilator acetylcholine was increased in the sildenafil treated groups (ND control vs SC: 71.2 \u00b1 9.3 vs 106.1 \u00b1 8%; HFD control vs SC: 92.1 \u00b1 3.9 vs 98.8 \u00b1 4.7%; p=0.05). There was no effect of diet or treatment on the EC50 for either constriction or relaxation. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that an alteration in uterine artery function is not the cause of growth restriction in this paradigm. Sildenafil citrate treatment increased vasodilation of the uterine artery, and had a beneficial effect on fetal growth. Further studies are needed to determine the precise mechanisms by which treatment increases fetal growth in this model. The relationship between birth weight centile and percent body fat (%BF) at delivery is not well understood. Our objective was to examine the correlation of neonatal %BF with birth weight centile for gestational age (GA).",

The estimate of fetal fat mass at 30 weeks gestation was the strongest predictor; each 1SD increase of the fetal body composition measure was independently associated with a 0.4SD increase in NB%FM.

INTRODUCTION: It is widely believed that the chronically hypoxic fetus is more vulnerable to birth asphyxia. However, surprisingly, there is little evidence to support this. Until now, it hasn't been possible to record continuously from the fetal cardiovascular system throughout a chronically hypoxic pregnancy, which explains the paucity of knowledge.",

Here, we investigated for the first time the effect of chronic fetal hypoxia on the fetal in vivo real-time cardiovascular response to an acute hypoxic episode. METHODS: At 119+2 days of gestation (term is 145 days), 12 fetal sheep were surgically prepared with catheters and carotid and femoral flow probes. Five days later, all animals were exposed to an acute hypoxia (30 min, fetal PaO 2 20\u00b10.5 to 10\u00b11 mmHg, P<0.05). The day after, half of the animals (n=6) were subjected to chronic hypoxia (fetal PaO 2 21\u00b11 to 12\u00b11 mmHg, P<0.05) for 10 days, from 125 days of gestation and then returned to normoxia. The other half (n=6) were normoxic. At 136 days, the acute hypoxia (30 min, PaO 2 20\u00b11 to 10\u00b10.5 mmHg, P<0.05) was repeated in all animals. Cardiovascular data were recorded throughout.",

            "text": "In normoxic pregnancy, acute hypoxia triggered the fetal circulatory brain sparing response. This was characterised by redistribution of blood flow from the femoral (FBF) and towards the carotid (CBF) circulation, thereby increasing the CBF:FBF oxygen delivery ratio (Fig.1) . In contrast, the fetal brain sparing circulatory response to acute hypoxia was almost absent in chronically hypoxic fetuses (Fig.1) . CONCLUSIONS: Chronic fetal hypoxia markedly impairs the fetal brain sparing response to acute hypoxia. We provide in vivo evidence that the chronically hypoxic fetus is at greater risk of demise during additional challenges such as birth asphyxia. Supported by the British Heart Foundation. *Figure(s) will be available online. Prior studies in our lab have found that modest increases in maternal cortisol significantly increased the incidence of peripartum fetal death. Transcriptomic analysis of the hearts revealed that the increased incidence in fetal death could be due in part to changes in cardiac function, as there were significant changes in gene expression in pathways related to cardiac metabolism and cardiac K channels. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that chronic maternal hypercortisolemia impairs fetal cardiac function, resulting in decreased fetal aortic pressure, heart rate, and altered ECG in late gestation and during labor. METHODS: Four ewes carrying singleton fetuses were infused with 1mg/kg/d cortisol (CORT) from 115 days of gestation (d) to term. Four similar ewes were not treated (CON). At 120-124d, DSI PA-D70 PCTP radiotelemetry devices were implanted into the fetuses for continuous monitoring of ECG, heart rate (HR) and aortic and amniotic fluid pressures through delivery. DSI Ponemah 5.00 and DSI Dataquest Open A.R.T 4.31 software were used to analyze ECG, and calculate one hour means of HR, and mean aortic pressure (MAP). RESULTS: Fetal plasma cortisol was increased by maternal cortisol infusion. CORT fetuses delivered at 140\u00b12d, and CON at 145\u00b12d. At 130d and 140d gestation and 1h before birth, CORT fetuses had significantly lower HR and MAP compared to CON fetuses. CORT fetuses also had elongated QT intervals compared to CON.",

The hypothalamus contains a large number of NMDA receptors and might be susceptible to glutamatedependent neuronal damage after hypoxia. We have previously reported that hypoxic hypoxia (HH) up-regulates the expression of inflammatory and apoptotic markers in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. The administration of ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, attenuates these responses. We propose that ketamine will have similar actions in the fetal hypothalamus. METHODS: Late gestation (123 \u00b13 days) ovine fetuses were chronically catheterized. Prior to the onset of HH (10 min), ketamine (3 mg/kg) was administered directly to the fetus as an intravenous bolus. Acute HH (30 min) was induced by intratracheal infusion of nitrogen gas to the ewe. Fetal hypothalami were collected 24 hrs after HH, mRNA extracted and hybridized to ovine Agilent 15.5k microarray. Significant differences in gene expression between the control and treatment groups (n=4/group) were determined with F-statistics using the limma package for R (P<0.05).",

The effect of ketamine on fetal HH hypothalamus was determined by analyzing the 84 overlap genes shared between HH upregulated and HH+ketamine downregulated groups. The enriched biological processes for the 84 overlap genes were involved in regulation of immune and inflammatory processes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that HH increased genomic expression in immune and inflammatory pathways in the fetal hypothalamus, and treatment with ketamine, significantly reduced these responses. Ketamine could be a potential therapeutic for pre-term infants in NICUs to attenuate neuronal damage as a consequence of hypoxic stress. Repetitive umbilical cord occlusions (UCO) with worsening acidemia induce fetal adaptive brain shut-down visible in electroencephalogram accompanied by cardiovascular decompensation evidenced by hypotensive blood pressure (BP) episodes during fetal heart rate (FHR) decelerations. The onset of this pattern is highly individual in time ranging from 10 min to 2 hours prior to reaching pH < 7.00. We hypothesized that fetuses have individual cardiovascular phenotype with regard to responses to rising acidemia with intermittent hypoxia, which would be reflected in individual temporal structure of FHR variability (fHRV) measure root mean square of successive differences of R-R intervals (RMSSD), a sensitive measure of vagal modulation of fHRV, which is known to increase with worsening acidemia. The algorithm uses continuous RMSSD to predict the temporal event when consistent hypotensive BP pattern emerges in an individual fetus. RMSSD was computed over 5 minute intervals for approx. 6 hours of each complete experiment and required 2.5 hours training time during baseline and mild UCO periods. This is similar to other machine learning methods. We then extracted change point information from the fluctuations in RMSSD time series to predict the individual hypotensive BP response. RESULTS: Our findings validated the hypothesis that the new algorithm can identify individual time points of BP responses to UCO with worsening acidemia. In the 26 out of 27 cases, the algorithm matched the expert prediction (Wang et al, PLoS One 2014) detecting the hypotensive BP response 17\u00b136 min before its visible onset from RMSSD time series.",

This method can be deployed online as bedside FHR monitoring for earlier prediction of incipient severe fetal acidemia. However, whether statins have beneficial or detrimental effects on fetal physiology in high risk pregnancy is completely unknown. Chronic fetal hypoxia is one of the most common consequences of complicated pregnancy. Here, we investigated the effects on fetal growth and fetal cardiac function of treatment with statins in human clinically relevant doses during hypoxic development in the chick embryo. This is the only animal model which permits isolation of the direct effects of statins on the fetus, independent of effects on the maternal and/or placental physiology. METHODS: Fertilised eggs were incubated under normoxia or hypoxia (14% O 2 ) from day 0 +/-pravastatin (1 mg.kg -1 ) or vehicle (water) treatment from day 13 of incubation (term is 21 days). At day 19, the embryo was euthanised by spinal transaction and weighed. Cardiac function was determined in a Langendorff preparation. A separate cohort of enbryos was perfusion fixed (4% paraformaldehyde at 2.66kPa) and the cardiac morphology established by stereology. RESULTS: Chronic fetal hypoxia led to fetal growth restriction (Fig.  1A) , depression of the left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP, Fig.  1B) , elevation of the LV end diastolic pressure (LVEDP, Fig. 1C ) and a reduction in the LV wall:lumen ratio (Fig. 1D) , indicating impaired systolic and diastolic function and significant dilated cardiomyopathy. Pravastatin in hypoxic embryos protected systolic and diastolic function but it did not prevent growth restriction or dilated cardiomyopathy. Pravastatin treatment in normoxic embryos also led to a dilated heart. CONCLUSIONS: We show isolated beneficial effects of statins on the fetal heart in compromised development. Statins may be attractive therapeutic candidates against fetal origins of heart disease as well as preeclampsia in human high risk pregnancy. However, statin treatment in normal pregnancy should be avoided. Supported by the British Heart Foundation *Figure(s) will be available online.",

The uterine artery (UA) must undergo a significant vasodilation to supply an adequate amount of maternal blood to the fetus for a successful pregnancy. The large conductance Ca 2+ -activated K + (BK Ca ) channel is highly expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) where it buffers depolarization and promotes vasodilation. BK Ca activity is increased in the UA during pregnancy and its inhibition reduces basal uterine artery blood flow. However, BK Ca expression is reduced in UA during pregnancy, thus, the mechanism by which the BK Ca channel is regulated in the UA during pregnancy is unclear. The BK Ca channel auxiliary g1-subunit increases channel activity in cerebral artery SMCs. We hypothesize that the g1-subunit enhances BK Ca channel activity in UA SMCs from pregnant mice to enhance vasodilation and increase uterine artery flow.",

In sheep and primates however, the appetitive neuropeptide neurons and circuitry develop primarily in utero. Therefore, exposure to excess leptin may alter expression of the appetitive neuropeptides: the anorexigenic peptides, proopiomelanocortin (POMC: \u03b1MSH precursor) and the cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART), and the orexigenic peptides, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti related protein (AgRP). We reported that plasma leptin is elevated in late gestation LTH fetal sheep (AJP 291:R1406; 2006) .

At 138-141 days gestation, hypothalami were collected from LTH and control fetuses. POMC, CART, NPY, AgRP and the melanocortin receptor 4 mRNA (MC4R) were measured by real time PCR (qRT-PCR). Cyclophilin (CYCLO) was used as a housekeeping gene. Differences between LTH and control were determined by Student's t-test ( p<0.05). Data presented as mean\u00b1SEM (fg mRNA/100 ng RNA). RESULTS: CART, NPY and AgRP were not different between LTH and control fetal sheep, although a strong trend (p=0.07) was noted for NPY being elevated. POMC and MC4R were significantly decreased in LTH compared to control fetuses. CYCLO mRNA did not differ between groups. We aim to understand the effect of delayed cord clamping (DCC) on the acid-base status measured from the umbilical cord at birth. Additionally, antenatal corticosteroid (ACS) administration may have an influence, by preparing the fetal lung for this transition. Thus, we also investigated if ACS administration affects the relationship between DCC and cord gas parameters and Apgar scores. METHODS: Starting in 2008, DCC became routine practice at our institution. This is a retrospective cohort of all preterm (24 0/7 to 32 6/7 weeks) NICU admissions between 2008-2012 in which DCC was performed routinely. Outcomes of cord gas parameters (umbilical artery pH, umbilical artery HCO3, and umbilical artery base deficit), and 1-and 5-minute Apgar scores were compared with a historical control group without DCC (neonates born in [2006] [2007] . Data were further stratified by ACS use. Chi-squared, t-test, Mann Whitney U, ANOVA, and Kruskall-Wallace tests were used. RESULTS: 479 neonates were included in the analysis. Neonates in the DCC group were more likely to have undergone emergency cesarean (33% v 16%, P <.01) and had more exposure to ACS (97% vs 88%, P <.01). There was no difference in cord gas parameters or Apgar scores between the two groups (Table1). The duration of DCC had no effect on outcomes. There was no effect of ACS administration on umbilical artery cord gas parameters or Apgar scores. ",

Administration of ACS had no effect on these parameters in relation to DCC. Endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production is partly responsible for the maintenance of uterine vasodilatation during physiologic states of high circulating estrogen levels, e.g. pregnancy; however, they are reported to be low in preeclampsic cases. Estrogen receptors (ER-\u03b1/\u03b2), classical nuclear receptors, localize to the endothelial cells plasma membrane (3-5% of ERs) and are responsible for nongenomic responses. Endothelial Nitric Oxidize Synthase (eNOS) is under complex regulatory mechanisms; which correlate to its activity state. Estradiol-17\u03b2 (E 2 \u03b2) induces eNOS activation to increase NO production, however, it is unknown if eNOS regulation is dependent on one or both ERs. We hypothesize that ER-\u03b1 and ER-\u03b2 localize to the plasma membrane of Uterine Artery Endothelial Cell (UAECs), are capable of changing eNOS phosphorylation and increase functional NO production. METHODS: UAECs cells were fixed and label with immunogold for visualization of caveolae, ER-\u03b1 and ER-\u03b2 using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). UAECs were treated with: 1) vehicle or increasing concentrations of E 2 \u03b2 (0.1-100nM; 0-30 minutes); 2) UAECs were pretreated with the nonspecific or specific ER inhibitors (ICI182,780, MPP or PHTPP) followed by E 2 \u03b2 or specific ER agonists (DNP or PPT) to analyze the changes in eNOS stimulatory phosphorylation sites, Ser1177, Ser635 vs. inhibitory site Thr495 via Western blot analyzes or to quantify the UAECs total NO production (nitrate + nitrite). RESULTS: TEM revealed that UAECs have substantial numbers of caveolae structures on their plasma membrane. Immunogold labeling revealed that ER-a localize to the plasma membrane, cytosol and nucleus while the ER-\u03b2 antibody lack specificity to yield a firm conclusion. E 2 \u03b2 increased Ser1177, Ser635 phosphorylation and decreased phosphorylation Thr495 in eNOS in a concentration and time-dependent manner. The increase in NO production was observed with all agonists tested (E 2 \u03b2, DPN or PPT). NO production with E 2 \u03b2 stimulation was not blocked when using ICI182,780 while partly being blocked when using combined ER specific antagonists (MPP/PHTPP). CONCLUSIONS: These data support the hypothesis 1) that ERs localize to the plasma membrane, cytosol and nucleus; 2) the existence of an ER-dependent and ER-independent mechanism that may be required for optimal NO production by UAECs during pregnancy . MBR showed no significant changes during pregnancy and did not show significant differences between pregnant and non-pregnant women.",

Agonist-mediated endothelium-derived vasodilator activity was assessed by wire myography. To examine the role of the endotheliumderived vasodilators, nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin in the regulation of endothelium-derived vasodilator activity, the NO synthase inhibitor, L-NAME (200 \u00b5mol/L) and cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (1 \u00b5mol/L) were used. RESULTS: Myogenic reactivity increased significantly (n=8/group, P<0.05) in uterine arteries from Rln KO mice compared with wild-type (Rln WT ) animals. Treatment with L-NAME and indomethacin further increased myogenic reactivity, but the effect of L-NAME was significantly greater in arteries from Rln KO compared with Rln WT mice. In contrast, development of myogenic reactivity in the presence of indomethacin was significantly (n=8/group, P<0.05) less in Rln KO mice, suggesting that vasodilator prostanoid production was decreased in the former group. Agonist-mediated endothelium-derived vasodilation was compromised in Rln KO mice (n=7/group, P<0.05). In the presence of L-NAME, uterine arteries from Rln KO mice were significantly (P=0.01) less sensitive to agonist-mediated endothelium-derived vasodilation, suggesting reduced bioavailability of NO. The adverse changes in uterine artery function were accompanied by a reduction in fetal weights in Rln KO 758 \u00b1 12 mg compared with Rln WT mice 845 \u00b1 9 mg (n=10-15/group, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our data show increases in myogenic reactivity and impaired endothelium-derived vasodilation in uterine arteries of latepregnant Rln KO mice, which may contribute to reduced uteroplacental blood flow and fetal growth restriction.

Some of our urinary HM findings confirm a previous report The follicular phase and pregnancy are physiological states of elevated estrogen levels and uterine blood flow (UBF). Such pregnancy adaptations provide nutrients and oxygen to meet fetal growth demands. Leptin and its receptor (OB-Rb) are involved in nutritional status and reproductive processes (e.g. amenorrhea and infertility, hypertension, and cardiac disease). It is unknown, if OB-Rb is locally expressed in the uterine arteries (UA) or whether it is altered during these physiologic states. We hypothesize that UA endothelium (UAendo) and UA vascular smooth muscle (UAvsm), expression of OB-Rb is elevated in pregnancy versus nonpregnant sheep suggesting a role in local UBF regulation.

Labetalol is one of the first-line antihypertensive medications commonly used during pregnancy and postpartum periods. The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics of oral labetalol during pregnancy and the postpartum period. METHODS: Ten pregnant subjects (mean age: 29 years) who were receiving oral labetalol at doses ranging from 100 to 400 mg, bid or tid for the treatment of persistent hypertension (SBP\u00b3150 mmHg) were recruited. Among the recruited subjects, 7 were studied both during pregnancy and the postpartum period (6 to 13 wks post-delivery), while 3 were studied only once. Plasma samples (n=12) were collected over one dosing interval (ie over 12 hours for bid or 8 hours for tid dosing). Plasma samples were subjected to liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate followed by analysis by a sensitive and validated LC-MS/MS method. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by non-compartment analysis with Phoenix WinNonlin. RESULTS: Pharmacokinetics of oral labetalol were not significantly different between pregnancy and the postpartum period. The exposure to labetalol defined as dose and body weight-normalized area under the curve (AUC) was 0.03\u00b1 0.02 vs. 0.03\u00b10.03 \u00b5g\u00b7h/L/mg/kg during pregnancy and the postpartum period, respectively. The body weight-normalized oral clearance (CL/F) was 3.8\u00b11.7 vs. 3.1\u00b10.5 L/h/kg during pregnancy and the postpartum period, respectively. The terminal phase half-lives for labetalol in pregnancy and the postpartum period were similar (2.0 vs. 2.3 h). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the pharmacokinetics of orally administered labetalol are similar between pregnant and postpartum women. Dosing recommendations therefore, do not need to be changed during pregnancy in women on this medication prior to pregnancy. Likewise, for women on labetalol during pregnancy, dosing recommendations do not need to be adjusted in the postpartum period.

The apparent terminal elimination halflives of diltiazem were similar during pregnancy and postpartum. All the pharmacokinetic parameters during the 2 nd and 3 rd trimesters were similar. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that pregnancy increased the oral clearance of diltiazem. This suggests that dosing of diltiazem especially for renal protection during pregnancy should be adjusted to reflect the increased clearance of this drug. In the UK, sepsis in pregnancy is the leading cause of direct maternal deaths. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of estrogen (E2) in conferring susceptibility to septic shock during pregnancy following an overwhelming immune response mediated by LPS. Previous work in our group showed that progesterone did not cause a heightened hypotensive effect on blood pressure. We hypothesised that administration of E2 may cause a significant cardiovascular collapse following LPS thus affecting maternal outcome. METHODS: Pressure transmitters were inserted into CD1 mice aorta capable of measuring mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) prior to time-mating. A copulatory plug would indicate gestational day E0. All animals were kept on a 12:12 light/dark cycle regimen, with ad libitum access to food and water. E2 (20ug/mouse) or vehicle (peanut oil, PO) was supplemented subcutaneously (subc) daily on E14, E15 and E16. On E16 LPS (10ug/mouse) and was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.). MAP and HR were measured for 24 hours after these treatments. Latency to labour and pup survival were recorded. RESULTS: MAP and HR were altered after LPS injection in the E2 treated group. MAP in the first 5 hours post LPS was markedly decreased in comparison to the controls (102\u00b13 mmHg for PO and 81\u00b114 mmHg for E2). Following this, MAP increased significantly by 11 hours (96\u00b15 for PO mmHg and 114\u00b116 mmHg for E2) to only decrease again below baseline at 18 hours (100\u00b12 for PO and 90\u00b112). HR at baseline (684\u00b16 bpm for PO and 599\u00b140 bpm for E2) dropped over 24 hours (686\u00b117 bpm for PO and 510\u00b153 bpm for E2). Latency to labour was increased in the E2 group (21.25\u00b15 hours for PO and 31.55\u00b111 hours for E2). No pups survived in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Estrogen is an important hormone which is regulated in a multifaceted way. E2 supplementation in pregnancy resulted in dysregulated blood pressure and heart rate but no clear pattern was identified. Supplementation did not affect maternal mortality and therefore did not cause a worsened outcome. However, E2 appeared to sensitize the cardiovascular response following LPS by an unknown mechanism.",

METHODS: CD-1 female mice were fed either a standard (SF, n=4) or high-fat (HF, n=4) diet for 3 months prior to breeding. A separate cohort mice on SF (n=11) and HF (n=8) diets were injected on gestational day 8 (GA 8) with adenovirus-carrying soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (SFsFlt1, HFsFtl1 groups) or control virus carrying murine immunoglobulin G2\u03b1Fc fragment (SFmFc, HFmFc groups). All groups after weaning were placed on SF diet. Serum AGE was measured using ELISA. Appropriate statistical methods were used for analyses (P\u00a30.05). RESULTS: In the pPO model, AGE levels were significantly higher in SF dams (P=0.03) on GA 18. At 6 months (mo) postpartum (pp) AGEs were significantly elevated in HF group (P=0.04, Figure) . HF female offspring had significantly increased AGEs (P=0.05) at 6 mo of age. In the pPO+PE model, on GA 18 AGEs were significantly higher in HFsFlt (P=0.01), SFsFlt1 (P=0.009) and SFmFc dams (P=0.009) compared to HFmFc. At 6 mo pp HFmFc had a significant increase in AGE when compared to SFsFlt1 (P=0.007) and HFsFlt1 (P=0.004) mice. Male offspring at 6 mo of age in SFmFc (P=0.005) and HFmFc (P=0.003) groups had significantly higher AGE levels compared to SFsFlt1 mice. * Figure( s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Depending on the pregnancy complication, timing in regards to pregnancy and gender of the offspring, we found direct and inverse correlations between the levels of AGE and the development of CVD. Our study confirms a well-established role for AGE as a marker for CVD and an emerging hypothesis that the accumulation of AGE in tissues decreases circulating levels of AGE. (HF-B) , which precedes the symptomatic stage C, is about 1 in 4 women. Low cardiac preload and high afterload may relate to both, PE and HF. We hypothesise that low cardiac preload and increased after load in the first two years after PE relate to the development of remote HF-B.",

We measured PV (ml/m 2 ) with the indicator dilution technique using I 125 -labelled albumin as proxy for cardiac preload. Total peripheral vascular resistance (TPVR in dynes/ sec/cm 5 ) was obtained by (80.mean arterial pressure (MAP, mmHg))/CO. At least 2 years later, women where re-invited for a follow up screening including a cardiac ultrasound to diagnose HF-B according to the AHA criteria as left ventricular hypertrophy, concentric remodeling, systolic dysfunction, or asymptomatic valve disease. RESULTS: 25/107 (23%) women had HF-B at follow up of which 2/3 had concentric remodeling indicating mainly diastolic dysfunction. Former PE women who developed HF-B at FU, had a lower PV at postpartum screening than women who did not develop HF-B (1551 vs 1473 ml . m 2 ; p <0.05) while TPVR was comparable in both groups. PV correlated with HF-B (r=-0.21, p trend 0.03) but not with TPVR (r=-0.06, p trend 0.54). CONCLUSIONS: Decreased PV, indicating reduced cardiac preload, relates to increased asymptomatic HF-B at follow up, while increased cardiac afterload as indicated by total peripheral vascular resistance did not relate to HF-B.

PPH was defined as vaginal and cesarean deliveries with estimated blood losses (EBL) of greater than 500ml and 1000ml, respectively. The EBL at which three different interventions were employed (dilation and curettage (D&C), balloon tamponade (BT), and interventional radiology (IR)) was determined and divided into quartiles. Outcomes including nadir hemoglobin, PRBC transfusion, ICU admission, and postpartum hysterectomy were compared according to the EBL quartile during which they occurred. RESULTS: 797 PPH (40% vaginal delivery, 49% cesarean delivery) occurred during the study period. The mean (standard deviation) EBL at which the D&C, BT, and IR, were initiated were 1654ml (737ml), 2012ml (748ml), and 2802ml (1334ml), respectively. Earlier BT groups were less likely to need a blood transfusion (test for trend, p=0.001) or ICU admission (test for trend, p = 0.003). Women who received BT earlier also had a higher nadir Hg (test for trend, p=0.012) and less risk of hysterectomy (test for trend, p=0.05). Lastly, women who received earlier IR (i.e., at an EBL less than the mean for IR) also were less likely to receive a hysterectomy (0% vs. 8.3%, p<0.049). CONCLUSIONS: Among women with PPH, earlier intervention with BT and IR was associated with a decrease in morbidity. The long-term maternal cardiovascular and metabolic implications associated with preeclampsia (PE) include risk of hypertension, heart disease and metabolic syndrome. The objective of this study was to investigate if a recent history of PE and/or lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is associated with detectable alterations in the circulating maternal proteome. METHODS: 6-month postpartum plasma from PE women (n=12) and women with uncomplicated obstetrical history (CTRL, n=12) were used for analysis. Depleted maternal plasma was analyzed by label-free liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry assay. Identified peptides were searched against the International Protein Index human database v3.87.

RESULTS: 113 eligible peptides were identified for analysis; 101 were common to both groups, 5 peptides were unique to CTRL and 7 unique to PE subjects.

Comparison of low-risk CTRL (n=6) to low-risk PE groups (n=6) found that while similar for BMI, blood pressure and fasting lipid profiles at 6 months postpartum, PE peptide profiles continued to display stronger associations for CVD and cardiotoxicity functions. Within this cluster, the most abundant proteins were associated with thrombosis, vascular disease and infarction. CONCLUSIONS: Markers of CVD and dysfunction are evident in the maternal circulating proteome 6 months postpartum after PE. Moreover, modifications in circulating peptide profiles occur in previously PE patients who otherwise do not have clinically measurable cardiovascular risk factors.

Quentin J Baca, 1 Brice Gaudilliere, 1 Garry P Nolan, 2 Martin S Angst. 1 1 Anesthesia, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA; 2 Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. INTRODUCTION: One in eight infants is born preterm, which accounts for a third of all infant death. While maternal immune traits rank high as a root cause of preterm birth, the nature of such traits is poorly defined. This study used mass cytometry to comprehensively map and interrogate the immune system of women with a history of term and preterm birth (Gaudilliere, Sci Transl Med 2014), and test the hypothesis that specific intracellular signaling responses in immune cell subsets are associated with preterm birth. METHODS: Blood samples from non-pregnant women (n=20) with a history of term (>37 GW) and preterm (<33 GW) birth were stained with 22 cell surface and 13 intracellular functional markers (STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, STAT6, CREB, NFkB, IkB, p38, MAPK, MAPKAP2, ERK, S6) at basal state and after stimulation with exogenous ligands (LPS, IL2, IL4, IL6, GM-CSF, INFa, TNFa) that activate intracellular signaling networks implicated in preterm birth. RESULTS: All samples have been banked and the assay has been validated in controls. Hierarchical clustering provided functional maps of the entire immune system and revealed cell-type specific signaling responses to exogenous ligands. *Figure(s) will be available online. Importantly, stimulation with ligands allowed the response sensitivity and magnitude of specific immune cell subsets to biologically relevant \"stressors\" to be inferred.

In particular, Bacillus spp. is the most significantly enriched taxon in pregnant women (45.61%) compared with non-pregnant women (0.12%). On the other hand, Pseudomonas spp. are the most enriched taxon in non-pregnant women (13.23%) compared with pregnant women (4.09%). An OTU that is assigned to family Pseudomonadaceae is also significantly enriched in non-pregnant women. Interestingly, Methylobacterium spp. are enriched among both non-pregnant women and pregnant women with preterm delivery, whereas they rarely exist among pregnant women with normal delivery. As for the compositional difference between women with normal and preterm delivery, Ureaplasma spp. and family Veillonelaceae were more frequently detected among women with preterm delivery, compared with those with normal delivery. CONCLUSIONS: The composition of EVs derived from Bacillus spp. increased during pregnancy, whereas those from Pseudomonas spp. increased in non-pregnant women, suggesting that microbe-derived EVs play a key role in the maintenance of homeostasis during pregnancy.

Cells isolated from placenta of lean and obese women by sequential trypsin -DNase digestion and gradient centrifugation were used for primary culture. Modulation of TLR4 signaling by long chain saturated and unsaturated FA (500 \u00b5M, 24 hrs) was investigated in cultured placental cells. RESULTS: TLR4 was localized on both sides of the placental barrier (syncyciotrophoblast layer and fetal vascular endothelium) suggesting they can be activated by either maternal or fetal FAs. TLR4 protein and gene expression were 2 and 4 fold greater in placenta of obese vs lean women. The saturated palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acids but not the unsaturated oleic acid (C18:1) increased TLR4 in cultured placental cells. The stimulation was higher (9 vs 3-fold and 5 vs 2-fold, p<0.001 respectively) in cells from obese vs lean women. Following palmitic acid(PA) exposure, cells of obese women released more inflammatory cytokines IL-6 (8 vs 3-fold, p<0.001), IL-8 (14 vs 7-fold, p<0.001), TNF-alpha (5 vs 3-fold, p<0.001) than cells from lean women. This was concordant with a higher placental mRNA expression of IL-6 (5.4\u00b12.5 vs 3.5\u00b12.6 copies/ngRNA, p<0.05) and is a leading cause of fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality. CYP1A1 polymorphisms is associated with risk of spontaneous PTB (sPTB). As CYP1A1 can be activated via aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), we hypothesize that altered transcription of placental CYP1A1 and AhR is associated with occurrences of sPTB. METHODS: Human placental tissues were obtained from normal term (NT; 39\u00b11 weeks' gestation, n=10), sPTB (30 \u00b1 4 weeks, n=5), and severe preeclamptic (sPE; 31 \u00b1 3 weeks, n=5) subjects. Total RNAs were reversetranscribed (RT) into cDNAs. Real-time qPCR analysis was performed with Taqman gene expression assays using ACTB and GAPDH as internal controls. Equal amounts (250 copies/ng of total RNA) of a synthetic RNA transcript (Xeno) were added to the RT reaction serving as an external control for RT-qPCR analysis. RESULTS: Based on CYP1A1 mRNA levels, NT placentas were stratified into low CYP1A1 (NT-L; < 5 copies of CYP1A1 transcripts/ng RNA) and high CYP1A1 (NT-H; (> 50 copies of CYP1A1 transcripts/ng RNA). NT-L consisted of the majority (8 out of 10) of NT placentas studied. In comparison to NT-L, NT-H placentas displayed significant (P <0.05) upregulation of CYP1A1 (55-fold), CYP1B1 (3-fold), and AhR (1.8-fold) mRNA. Compared with NT-L, sPTB placentas exhibited significant (P <0.05) up-regulation of CYP1A1 (3-fold), significant (P <0.05) downregulation of AhR, and similar level of CYP1B1 mRNA. No significant difference in CYP1A1/B1 and AhR mRNA levels was detected between NT-L and sPE placentas. Moreover, the CYP1A1 mRNA levels in sPTB placentas were negatively correlated (Correlation Coefficient = -0.94, P=0.02) with gestational ages, ranging from 26 to 34 weeks; however, this correlation was not observed in NT placentas and gestational age matched sPE placentas. No significant correlation was observed between AhR, CYP1B1 and gestational ages in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: While CYP1A1 remains at a relatively low level in the majority of NT placentas, CYP1A1 can be robustly induced in a subset of NT placentas in association with AhR and CYP1B1 up-regulation. Data from this study also suggest that the altered transcriptional regulation of CYP1A1 and AhR observed in sPTB, but not in sPE, placentas may play an important role in inducing sPTB.

Therefore, we evaluated whether a calcium channel blocker can protect first trimester human trophoblasts from an adverse environment. METHODS: Human first trimester chorionic villous explants and the human trophoblast cell line HTR-8/SVneo (HTR) were cultured. Tissues and HTR cells were pre-treated with 12.5 -50 nM of the calcium channel blocker nifedipine for 1 hour before exposure to 50 mM ethanol for an additional hour. Intracellular Ca 2+ concentrations were monitored in real-time by epifluorescence microscopy using fluo4-AM. Apoptosis was assessed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). One-way ANOVA with post hoc t-test comparisons was used to identify significant differences (p<0.05) in Ca 2+ and apoptosis. RESULTS: Intracellular Ca 2+ concentrations increased synchronously in trophoblasts within 10 s of exposure to 50 mM ethanol from 96.9 \u00b1 23.2 nM to 1230.8 \u00b1 291.4 nM, followed by an increase in cell death within 1 h. The increase in intracellular Ca 2+ was completely blocked in cells pretreated with nifedipine for 1 h. Cell death increased significantly in both villous explants (from 15.6 \u00b1 2.45% to 24.9 \u00b1 0.84%) and HTR cells (from 4.3 \u00b1 0.004% to 11.8 \u00b1 0.001%) after exposure to ethanol (p<0.05). Treatment with nifedipine blocked ethanol-induced cell death. CONCLUSIONS: Ethanol-induced apoptosis in human first trimester trophoblast cells was dependent upon intracellular Ca 2+ signaling. We have previously demonstrated that increased apoptosis due to acute ethanol exposure requires both intracellular and extracellular Ca 2+ . This study shows that nifedipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker, can rescue first trimester trophoblast cells from an adverse environment. There is evidence suggesting that calcium channel blockers have direct positive effects on endothelial dysfunction, which is found in placenta-mediated disorders. Fetal alcohol syndrome is associated with intrauterine growth restriction, which is due in part to trophoblast cell death. Nifedipine could provide a novel intervention for women who are at risk for these obstetrical disorders. ",

Realtime PCR was performed to assess changes in angiogenic factors and in vitro invasion and tube formation assays were performed using uterine microvascular endothelial cells, (UtMEC), HTR8 and primary extravillous trophoblast. RESULTS: DCM-treatment strongly upregulates mRNA expression of several potent pro-angiogenic factors > 40-fold in comparison to matched SFM controls (CXCL2, IL8, CXCL3, IL6, and VEGF-A), and also downregulates expression of potent angiostatic factors (COL18A1, THBS1, ANGPTL1), this was abrogated by neutralisation of both IL8 and TGF-\u03b2 signalling (p\u25ca\u20390.01, n=5). In in vitro tube assays either DCM or IL8 and TGFB priming of PBN led to a significant increase in an extensive organised network of tubes in both UtMEC and HTR8 cells as compared to controls (p\u25ca\u20390.01, n=5). Again both IL8 and TGF-\u03b2 antagonists, alone and in combination, inhibited this effect (p\u25ca\u20390.01, n=5).

Increased angiotensin II activity and increased placental sflt-1 production are associated with preeclampsia. To better understand the relationship between sflt-1, the renin-angiotensin system, and pregnancy outcomes, we study a transgenic (TG) mouse model with an isolated 20% increase in maternal angiotensinogen (AGT) expression, which is sufficient to cause gestational hypertension and fetal growth restriction. TG dams have characteristic features of placental insufficiency, including elevated maternal serum sflt-1 and absent end-diastolic flow (AEDF) in fetal umbilical arteries near term. Others have suggested that AEDF may be a feature of reduced placenta capillary density. Therefore, we hypothesized that TG dams will have fewer fetoplacental capillaries compared with carefully age-matched wild-type (WT) controls. METHODS: Six TG and WT litters were compared at day 16.5 (term day 19.5). 24 randomly selected placentas from these six litters were used for analysis. The fetus was used to determine gender. Each placenta was weighed, measured, and cut into four unequal pieces, randomly oriented for paraffin embedding, and then sectioned for CD31 staining (abcam28364).

CONCLUSIONS: Placentas from mice expressing 20% more AGT than WT controls tended to be thinner with a decreased overall capillary volume.

In normal pregnancy branching of the placental villi occurs in late gestation, providing a low-resistance circuit for blood flow.

METHODS: Fetuses diagnosed with IUGR (weight <10%) and abnormal UA Doppler indices (increased systolic: diastolic ratio, absent or reversed end diastolic flow) were compared to fetuses with normal parameters. Placentas were collected from IUGR and control (normally-grown) subjects from both singleton and multiple pregnancies. For singletons IUGR (n=3) and controls (n=5) were unrelated.

These parameters were used to generate in silico models that can predict physiological shear stresses in the spiral arteries, as well as the resulting oxygenation of, and pressure experienced by the placenta. RESULTS: 1) Whilst upstream spiral artery flow generates around 100Pa of shear stress, in a partially remodeled spiral artery, our model predicts a low shear region of 0.1-5Pa extending ~7mm into the uterine tissue. This is important because our previous in vitro studies have shown low shear stress conditions in first trimester spiral arteries may promote trophoblast-induced remodeling of these vessels. Therefore, together these data suggest that both cellular interactions and the resulting structural changes to the vessels act in a cyclical manner to promote adequate spiral artery remodelling.",

This highlights the fine balance that exists between these two parameters for optimal blood flow in pregnancy.

Earlier studies revealed a role for abnormal cytotrophoblast (CTB) differentiation along the invasive pathway. As a followup, we investigated differences in global gene expression between T21 and euploid placentas. Caspase-2 (CASP2) expression was 8-fold higher in T21. In other studies, CASP2 is associated with apoptosis-related cytoskeleton degradation, oxidative stress-induced cell death, and cell cycle regulation.

RESULTS: CASP2 was significantly overexpressed (protein and mRNA levels) in T21 placentas. Highest CASP2 expression was in villous cores, and in villous and extravillous CTBs CASP3 had the same expression pattern as CASP2. Using the TUNEL approach, we observed high variability in the number of apoptotic cells in biopsies from different regions of the same placenta and among different placentas. However, T21 placentas had more apoptotic cells, specifically in cell columns and basal plates.

RESULTS: ET-1 had a dose-dependent effect on MMP/TIMP expression after 24h, with 100nM ET-1 inducing the maximum response, downregulating MMP-2 (24%; p=0.025), MMP-14 (21%; p=0.054) and MMP-15 (26%; p=0.019) and up-regulating TIMP-3 (47%; p=0.01) and TIMP-4 (52%; p=0.03) at the mRNA level, as well as down-regulating MMP-2 (17%; p=0.004), MMP-14 (25%; p=0.055) and MMP-15 (26%; p=0.046) protein levels.

Controls included mice treated with vehicle or PI-sparing cART. On day 15 mice were euthanized, pregnancy loss, number, viability and weight of fetuses, and placenta weight were recorded.Placenta tissue and cardiac blood were collected for angiogenic factor analysis by q-PCR and ELISA. Some placentas were perfused with a casting agent into the arterial vasculature, and then scanned using a micro-CT. RESULTS: PI exposure resulted in significantly lower fetal and placental weight compared to control.PI exposure did not have a significant effect on the expression of pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF, VEGF receptor 2 (Flk-1), or PlGF. But PI exposure significantly reduced the expression levels of VEGF receptor 1 (Flt-1), an anti-agiogenic factor. Levels of sFlt-1 directly correlated with fetal weight.Placental blood vessel imaging revealed a significant difference in the size and number of blood vessels in the PI exposed mice with increased number of arterioles with shorter length. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that PIs adversely affect angiogenesis during pregnancy. PI use was associated with a proangiogenic state characterised by reduced levels of sFlt-1 and greater branching of arterioles in the placenta.This state correlated with fetal growth restriction. These results address a gap in knowledge of HIV antiretroviral toxicity in pregnancy. The mouse model provides a useful tool to better understand the mechanisms that underlie pregnancy complications experienced by HIV+ women receiving cART. We are currently investigating the mechanisms involved in PI-induced downregulation of sFlt-1 and are extending our findings to HIV+ pregnant women. Understanding the impact of cART on angiogenesis during pregnancy may lead to better clinical management of HIV+ pregnant women.

Finally, we also fixed some first trimester villous tissue, some following a 30-minute treatment with IFN-g, and stained with the above antibodies. RESULTS: STAT1 upregulation during EVT differentiation was confirmed by western blot, with more intense STAT1 and pSTAT1 levels in samples cultured in medium containing IFN-g. Immunofluorescence staining of cultured CTB showed phospho-STAT1 only in HLA-G+ cells, and only following IFN-g treatment. Treatment with IFN-g significantly decreased MMP2 secretion, as previously shown; however, FACS analysis showed a 1.5-fold increase in proportion of HLA-G+ cells in CTB cultures differentiated in presence of IFN-g. Finally, in primary villous tissue, STAT1 and p-STAT1 were detected only in HLAG+ cells, with markedly increased staining for both following IFN-g treatment. CONCLUSIONS: IFN-g signaling through the STAT transcription factors has previously only been evaluated in context of EVT invasion and interaction with the maternal immune system.

Wound healing cell migration test and matrigel invasion test was also perfomed using HTR-8/SVneo cells. RESULTS: Pregnancy-associated hormones increased the expression of HMGA1 mRNA in the matrigel invasion assay. Especially, HMGA1 was strongly expressed in the invasive cells in immunofluorescence analysis. We also found cytoplasmic expression level of HMGA1 was increased in the migrating cell in wound healing cell migration test. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that HMGA1 might have a critical role in trophoblast invasion. The vascular exchange region of the human placenta, called the villus, brings fetal and maternal blood systems into close proximity to facilitate the transfer of gases and nutrients. Development begins at gestational age week 5 and vascular defects cause placental defects in up to 10% of all pregnancies, resulting in life long chronic disease in the mother and her child. We propose our lack of knowledge in human villus development is preventing advances in technologies to counter pregnancy complications. As most developmental processes involve transitory populations of cells that drive and organize developing cellular networks, I hypothesize a cellular analysis of the human placenta will identify populations of transitory cells that direct villus development. METHODS: Through a systems biology approach, I employed a 370 CD antigen screen to identify transitory populations of cells between week 6 or 10 that span the critical period of villus formation. I anticipate markers of progenitor cell subpopulations to be strongly expressed at week 6 and decrease by week 10, as the cells differentiate into complex villus structures. Villi samples were dissociated into two fractions: trophoblast and stromal enriched fractions. The high throughput flow cytometry assay was conducted on trophoblast fractions. Markers of dynamic populations are ranked by fold change differences and biological relevance for validation. RESULTS: Using the most stringent filtering criteria, 4 increasing and 6 decreasing developmentally regulated populations were confidently identified in both replicates of the screen. 74 dynamic markers were found to mark dynamic populations in only one replicate. We have confirmed two markers of transient, decreasing trophoblast cells are labeling independent populations. Targeted flow cytometry analysis confirmed distinct EpCAM+ and EpCAM-populations in week 5 placentas. A CDCP1 population was identified that does not co-express EGFR or EPCAM. In week 6 placentas, histological analysis revealed EpCAM+ cells were present in cytotrophoblasts (CTB) and columnar CTB but by week 8, EpCAM expression is reduced and restricted to columnar CTB, suggesting EpCAM becomes restricted to proliferative cells. CONCLUSIONS: This resource of CD antigen expression in early human villi development will be a valuable asset to studying placenta organogenesis. My work has developed strong evidence to support the existence of transient populations of cells in the human placenta. .

ERRy might also act on estradiol production through its interaction with CYP19. In vitro studies in other tissues suggest an estradiol protective role against oxidative stress. Interestingly, CYP19 levels are significantly higher in the most severe IUGR. We might speculate that the CYP19 alterations have an estrogenrelated protective action in more severe IUGR, which we showed to be characterized by increased mtDNA, a marker of oxidative stress. METHODS: Dual-perfused placental cotyledons (n=21) were prepared from C-section term deliveries. Following equilibration with 95% O2/5% CO2 (normoxia) the maternal side was sequentially perfused with Krebs solution with hypoxia (95% N2/5% CO2) and normoxia. Changes in perfusion pressure in the fetal system were monitored. 1-mM L-arginine (n=3), 1-mM D-arginine (n=2), 1-mM BQ123 (n=3) or normal saline (n=10) were administered to the fetal compartment prior to the initiation of hypoxia in the maternal side. 1-mM L-arginine (n=3) was also administered to the maternal system. Changes in the fetal-side perfusion pressure were compared in these groups. RESULTS: Hypoxia in the maternal side was associated with increased (mean delta 3.17+1.33 mm Hg) fetal-side perfusion pressure. L-arginine administration to the fetal system blunted the effect of hypoxia-induced fetal vascular hypertension (mean delta 0.40+0.6 mm Hg; p=0.006), while its introduction into maternal system had no vasodilatory effect (mean 1.93+0.35 mm Hg; p=0.15). D-arginine and BQ123 administration to the fetal compartment did not significantly change the hypoxic effect on the fetal vasculature (mean 2.1+0.71 and 2.23+0.9, respectively; p=0.7 and 0.3, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: 1) L-arginine, but not D-arginine or BQ123, reduces the fetal vasoconstriction suggesting that NO, but not endothelin, signaling is involved in fetal vasoconstriction; 2) L-arginine administration into maternal system did not reduce the vasoconstriction in the fetal side; 3) lack of maternal L-Arginine effects on the vasoconstriction suggests that either NO produced within the maternal compartment is not involved in regulation of fetal vascular reactivity or L-arginine transfer to the fetal side is insufficient to acutely relax chorionic vessels, or both. The fetus is largely dependent on the placenta for its lipid supply. Placentas of obese and diabetic women accumulate lipids due to increased fatty acid (FA) synthesis and esterification, which may alter fetal lipid exposure. Omega-3 polyunsaturated FA (N-3 PUFA) such as docosahexanoate (DHA) and eicosapentanoate (EPA) alter FA metabolism in hepatocytes, though their effect on placental tissue is largely unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate whether chronic N-3 PUFA supplementation during pregnancy affects lipid metabolism in placentas of obese and overweight women.",

Women were recruited in early gestation (<16 weeks) and randomized to either placebo (wheat oil, n=16) or N-3 supplement (800mg DHA and 1200mg EPA/day, n=17) for the remainder of pregnancy. Fatty acids were measured in maternal plasma before supplementation and at 34-36 wks of gestation. Expression of candidate genes involved in FA oxidation (CPT1b, PPAR\u03b1 and AMPKa), lipid synthesis/accumulation (PPAR\u03b3, DGAT1, SCD1 and PLIN2) and FA uptake (CD36 and FABPpm) was analyzed by real time PCR in placental tissue collected at term delivery. RESULTS: Plasma concentration of EPA and DHA was significantly increased by 3 and 1.4 fold respectively in N-3 PUFA supplemented subjects (p<0.05) by the completion of the study. N3/N6 ratio in maternal plasma was increased in treated by 1.5-fold compared to placebo.

Expression of genes regulating FA oxidation or uptake, was not changed suggesting that n-3 PUFA supplementation alters the lipid distribution in placental tissue rather than FA uptake from maternal circulation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that a 1.5-fold increase in the N3/ N6 ratio during pregnancy in obese and overweight women is associated with inhibition of placental lipid accumulation pathways. This, in turn, may negatively regulate the levels of lipid substrates delivered to the fetus. ",

CONCLUSIONS: Apelin levels mirror the cardiovascular changes seen in pregnancy and are therefore not its primary driver. Low apelin levels in IUGR may explain the decreased maternal cardiac output seen in these pregnancies. Furthermore, the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is known to be activated in human preeclampsia. Angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 antagonist is efficacious antihypertensive agents, but are counter indicated during pregnancy due to nephrotoxicity in the fetus. We therefore investigated the effects of an angiotensin II receptor subtype 2 agonist (C21) on model mice expressing the preeclampsia phenotype. METHODS: Blastocysts that had been incubated with adenovirus vectors containing CD40L were transferred into the uterine horns of pseudopregnant ICR mice. A subcutaneous osmotic pump containing C21 or saline was placed in each mouse's side-dorsal region. Blood pressure (BP) was measured by the tail-cuff method and urine samples used for measuring albumin concentrations were collected via metabolism cages. On e17.5, the uteri were removed from the pregnant mice and, upon surgical delivery of the neonates, subjected to morphological investigation with the placentas. The neonates and placentas were weighed. RESULTS: C21 did not alter maternal BP or the weights of the neonates and placentas. However, relative to saline controls, albuminuria was attenuated significantly by C21. CONCLUSIONS: C21 improved maternal renal function without having significant effects on maternal BP or fetal growth. The aim of this study was to determine the levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor subunits (a 1 and \u03b2 2 ) in the hippocampus of rat models of preeclampsia and eclampsia as the subunits may be important in these disorders. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 5/group) were used: non-pregnant, pregnant controls and rats treated on gestation day (GD, 14) with low dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 ug/kg, Sigma Aldrich) to induce preeclampsialike conditions and rats treated with LPS (GD 14) + pentylenetetrazole (PTZ, 40 mg/kg, GD 20, Sigma) to induce seizures similar to eclampsia. The hippocampus from all rats was obtained 1 hour after PTZ treatment. Total RNA was extracted and reverse-transcribed into cDNA and RT-qPCR (QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit and QuantiNova SYBR Green PCR Kit, Qiagen, Alameda, CA) was performed as per Qiagen's protocol. The mRNA level for GABA subunits was estimated using the delta-delta Ct method compared to expression of HPRT. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using polyclonal antibodies to the subunits (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) by standard protocols. IHC was quantified (doubleblind x 2 observers) as grades of percent positive staining cells (scale = 1 to 3) x ratings of stain intensity (0 = no stain, 1 = light, 3 = strong) from slides (n=5/group) to obtain scores (scale = 0 to 9) using published IHC methods (J. Translational Med. 2014, 12:273) . Anova was used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: No significant differences in mRNA expression of GABA subunits for a1 or b 2 were found between groups by RT-qPCR (values = ca. 20 units per group, P>0.05). IHC reveals very low levels and no significant differences (p>0.05) of both a 1 and b 2 subunits of non-pregnant, pregnant and preeclampsia rats (scores = 0) but significantly higher levels of subunit expression in eclamptic-like rats (scores = 2.00\u00b10.71, p< 0.001, a1 and 2.20\u00b10.45, p<0.001, b 2 ). CONCLUSIONS: The lack of significance of gene expression for a 1 and \u03b2 2 subunits between groups as measured with RT-qPCR may be attributed to post-transcriptional regulation because IHC demonstrates high levels of the target subunits in eclampsia-like rats. The increase in subunits in the hippocampus by IHC indicates important roles in seizures associated with eclampsia. Aberrant UBF is found in pregnancy disorders such as preeclampsia with IUGR characterized by endothelial cell dysfunction. Endothelialderived vasodilators, PGI 2 and NO, regulate vasodilation by respectively modulating cAMP-and cGMP-mediated mechanisms in uterine artery endothelium. Uterine artery endothelial cells from pregnant ewes (P-UAEC) produce markedly more PGI 2 and NO in response to ATP via Ca 2+ mediated mechanisms which requires GJ protein Cx43 for normal pregnancy enhanced Ca 2+ responses to enhance NO production. cAMP signaling mechanisms acutely open GJ gating through the phosphorylation of GJ protein Cx43 serine (S)365, however, the role of cGMP in GJ function is unknown. Hypothesis: cAMP and cGMP will increase the phosphorylation states of Cx43 and also increase Ca 2+ response to ATP. METHODS: P-UAEC were treated with either 8-Bromo-cAMP or -cGMP (1uM/1mM) for 5min, 15min, 30min, 60min and 12hrs and analyzed by western blotting for the phosphorylation at Cx43 S365 (pCx43 S365) and S368 sites, respectively. For the Ca 2+ studies, P-UAEC were loaded with Fura-2 (Ca 2+ dye), stimulated by ATP (100uM) and imaged for 30min. 8-Bromo-cAMP or -cGMP (1uM/1mM) was added for 30min and restimulated with ATP and Ca 2+ bursts were measured. In GJ function studies, P-UAECs were analyzed using the scrape-loading/dye transfer technique.",

INTRODUCTION: Symptoms of preeclampsia (PE) including hypertension and vascular leakiness (edema/proteinuria) are associated with endothelial dysfunction, but the underlying cause is poorly understood. Growth factors and cytokines are possible mediators of acute endothelial dysfunction in PE through disruption of cell-cell junctions in an ovine model. VEGF-165 and TNFa are known to phosphorylate gap junction proteins at inhibitory residues and so limit cell-cell connectivity. Cell-cell connectivity is essential to maintain sustained Ca2+ signals in response to vasodilation-promoting agonists, which is necessary for the production of vasodilators such as nitric oxide. The resulting loss of vasodilation likely contributes to hypertension in PE. Others describe a possible role for VEGF-165 and TNFa in mediating tight junction breakdown. The resulting loss of monolayer integrity could contribute to the edema and proteinuria often observed in PE. We thus hypothesize that VEGF-165 and TNFa will both inhibit sustained Ca2+ responses and reduce monolayer integrity. < 30 (control, n = 6) , and pregnancies complicated with obesity (BMI > 30, n = 9). Arteries were pressurized and loaded with the Ca 2+ -sensitive dye fura 2 AM. Fura 2 fluorescence was assessed using a photomultiplier system. Bradykinin (BK)-induced vasodilation was evaluated in pre-constricted arteries before or after pretreatment with L-NNA and indomethacin. Changes in SMC [Ca 2+ ] i and the diameters were studied in response to NS309, a specific activator of SK/IK channels. RESULTS: BK-induced (0.3 -30 nM) vasodilation was associated with SMC [Ca 2+ ] i reduction and was significantly blunted in myometrial arteries of obese (OB) vs. normal weight (NW) women (45.9.\u00b1 14.5 vs. 85.4 \u00b1 7.6% at 3 nM of BK). Vasodilation to BK was mostly preserved after inhibition of NO and prostacyclin in arteries of NW but was significantly inhibited in vessels from OB (62.2 \u00b1 4.0 vs. 14.9 \u00b1 8.2 % at 3 nM of BK). The degree of NS309-induced vasodilation was negatively correlated with BMI. CONCLUSIONS: BK-induced vasodilation was resistant to NO and prostacyclin inhibition demonstrating an important role of the EDHF system in the control of maternal myometrial vascular tone in normal weight women. Increased maternal adiposity in pregnancy resulted in blunted BK-induced dilation most likely due to impaired function of SK/ IK channels. Endothelial dysfunction in myometrial resistance arteries may be an important mechanism linking maternal obesity with increased risk for hypertension and preeclampsia in human pregnancy.",

            "text": "Melatonin INTRODUCTION: Preeclampsia remains a major cause of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. It is thought to be, at least in part, due to the placental release of anti-angiogenic factors, such as soluble fmslike tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt1), soluble endoglin (sEng) and activin A, that trigger maternal endothelial dysfunction, leading to the clinical features of preeclampsia including maternal hypertension and proteinuria. Current treatment is focussed on managing the hypertension to allow prolongation of pregnancy. There is no targeted therapy for the endothelial dysfunction. Melatonin and resveratrol are two antioxidants that offer promise as placental and endothelial targeted therapies and so as future treatments for preeclampsia. We aimed to assess the efficacy of resveratrol and melatonin in reducing placental oxidative stress, the placental production of antiangiogenic factors and in improving endothelial function. METHODS: Placental explants from normal term pregnancies were cultured at 1% oxygen and treated with either melatonin or resveratrol. 8-Isoprostane (a marker of oxidative stress), sFlt1 and sEng production was measured by ELISA. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured with TNF\u03b1 and with either melatonin or resveratrol. Endothelial activation was assessed by the measurement of ICAM1, VCAM1 and E-Selectin by flow cytometry and endothelin-1 levels by ELISA. RESULTS: Melatonin did not significantly affect placental 8-Isoprostane production or sEng production following exposure to hypoxia (P>0.05). Hypoxia-induced placental sFlt1 production was significantly decreased by Melatonin (hypoxia alone: 221.4\u00b137.9 pg/mg tissue vs. hypoxia+melatonin: 159.2\u00b122.4 pg/mg tissue). Melatonin did not significantly affect TNF\u03b1-induced increase in ICAM1, E-Selectin and Endothelin-1 in HUVECs, but reduced VCAM1 expression 3.5-fold (P=0.0001). Resveratrol reduced hypoxia-induced placental 8-isoprostane production 3-fold (P=0.0002) and halved hypoxia-induced sFlt1 production (P=0.01), but had no significant effect on placental sEng production. Resveratrol significantly reduced TNF\u03b1-induced endothelial activation markers ICAM1, VCAM1 and E-Selectin in HUVECs and the production of Endothelin-1 (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Melatonin and Resveratrol reduce hypoxia-induced placental oxidative stress and sFlt1 production, and may improve TNF\u03b1induced endothelial dysfunction. These data support the continued assessment of both agents as future therapies for pre-eclampsia. The glycocalyx (GC), located on the luminal surface of the vascular endothelium, has important functional and vasoprotective roles; e.g., as a selective barrier between endothelium and blood, and mediatior of nitric oxide mechanotransduction. Damage to the GC structure is implicated in reperfusion injury, atherosclerosis, and diabetes. We hypothesized that microvascular perfusion and GC structural integrity are reduced in postpartum women with a history of preeclampsia (PE).",

Since angiotensin II increases placental sflt-1 (soluble VEGF receptor) production, which may sequester spiral artery VEGF, we hypothesized that stimulating uterine VEGF expression may rescue the phenotype. Alternatively, reducing angiotensin II production with an ACE inhibitor may also rescue the phenotype. METHODS: Litter size and birthweight were measured in 21 WT and 23 TG dams without any intervention. Uterine vascular targeted transfections were performed in 12 WT and 12 TG virgin mice using either VEGF or luciferase plasmid conjugated to cationic microbubbles using our published protocols. Half of these mice were used to determine transfection efficiency. Uterine luciferase expression was monitored by intraperitoneal luciferin injection and bioluminescence; uterine VEGF expression was separately established by qRT-PCR. In addition, a separate set of dams were randomized to either 250 mg/liter of Captopril in drinking water for the first 10 days of gestation, or water without ACE inhibitor. We monitored daily water intake, maternal weight, newborn weight, and fetal kidney development in histologic sections evaluated by pathologist. RESULTS: VEGF and luciferase expression peaked at day 3 posttransfection and persisted through day 10 with detectable levels at term (day 19). Compared with WT controls, VEGF transfected WT dams had significantly larger litter sizes (8.1 +/-0.16 vs 10 +/-0.71, respectively) and similar birthweights (1.43 grams each). TG dams had significantly smaller pups than WT controls (1.26 grams), which persisted if transfected with luciferase (1.29 grams), but was ameliorated by VEGF delivery (1.41 grams). Captopril rescued male, but not female birthweight and did not appear to affect nephrogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound-mediated cavitation of cationic microbubbles conjugated to genes of interest provides a novel method to target molecular pathways like the VEGF/AGT axis, which plays a key role in uterine spiral artery remodelling. release of sFlt-1 and soluble endoglin (sEng) from placenta 2) endothelial dysfunction and 3) vasoconstriction.

Five PPIs (including esomeprazole, rabeprazole, lansoprazole) were added at increasing doses (0-100\u00b5M), and the following examined: 1) sFlt-1/sEng production 2) endothelial dysfunction (modelled by adding TNF\u03b1 or PE patient serum to endothelial cells) 3) vasodilation (whole vessels taken from the maternal omentum, and vasodilation measured by pressure myography). RESULTS: PPIs caused a dose-dependent reduction in mRNA expression of sFlt-1 variants (e15a and i13) and reduced secretion of sFlt-1 and sEng in all cell types. The decrease was potent: the top dose of esomeprazole decreased sFlt1 release from trophoblast by 50%, and sEng release by 90%. In contrast, the same doses of pravastatin had minimal or no effect on sFlt1/sEng production. Importantly, PPIs markedly reduced sFlt-1 production from placental explants obtained from women with severe PE. PPIs rescued both TNF\u03b1 and PE serum induced endothelial dysfunction (quenching leukocyte adhesion and attenuating VCAM1 and endothelin-1 expression). Furthermore, PPIs blocked TNF\u03b1-induced disruption of endothelial tube formation (both HUVECs and uterine microvascular cells). Finally, esomeprazole dose-dependently promoted vasodilation in whole vessels obtained from the omentum. CONCLUSIONS: PPIs potently decrease sFlt-1/sEng release, quench endothelial dysfunction and promote vasodilation.

Placental HtrA4 protein was secreted into the maternal circulation and the serum HtrA4 in normal pregnancy increased significantly between the first and second trimesters then remained constant for the remainder of the pregnancy. Women with earlyonset PE showed significantly higher serum HtrA4 levels compared to gestation-age-matched controls; again this was not seen in late-onset PE. High levels of HtrA4 disturbed endothelial cell capillary tube formation and increased monolayer permeability in a dose-dependent manner, and this was linked to alterations in junctional proteins and microtubule stability. CONCLUSIONS: HtrA4 is a novel placenta-specific serine protease that is specifically elevated in early-onset PE. High levels of HtrA4 in the maternal circulation may contribute to endothelial dysfunction and PE development. The glycocalyx is a gel-like matrix of glycoproteins, proteoglycans and plasma proteins that acts as a selective barrier between the blood and the endothelium. The breakdown of this vasoprotective layer leads to endothelial dysfunction and may increase cardiovascular risk.

Placentas were obtained from women with normal pregnancy and preeclampsia after C-section. Placental explants from normal pregnant women were cultured in RPMI1640 with or without amniotic fluids or placental explant culture conditioned media for 24 hours followed by Western blot to analyze the expression of CRP's. The mRNA levels of CRP's were analyzed by qPCR. RESULTS: Amniotic fluid from women who subsequently had normal pregnancy stimulated the up-regulation of CRP's in placenta and these effects were lower with amniotic fluid from women who subsequently developed preeclampsia. In contrast, conditioned media from normal term placental explant cultures failed to up-regulate CRP's, whereas conditioned media from preeclamptic placental explant cultures induced up-regulation of CRP's in normal term placentas. The mRNA levels of CRP's in placentas obtained from preeclamptic patients were significantly elevated compared to that of normal placentas. CONCLUSIONS: Data suggested that, during normal pregnancy the expression of CRP's at the feto-maternal interface is inducible early in pregnancy and therefore, normal pregnancy is characterized by low level of complement activation. In women who subsequently develop preeclampsia, complement activation is greater due to lack of increase in CRP's levels. However, during the 3 rd trimester, expression of CRP's in preeclamptic placenta is increased which was a late response and therefore, insufficient to adequately contain complement cascade.",

We focused on amniotic fluid in order to better reflect processes operant at the fetal-maternal interface. METHODS: A cohort of 731 women with singleton non-anomalous pregnancies undergoing second trimester genetic amniocentesis was followed to delivery and analyzed as a nested case-control study. Cases of early-onset preeclampsia developing before 34 weeks' gestation (n=15) were compared with 47 uncomplicated term controls. Amniotic fluid collected at amniocentesis was tested for complement split products Bb, C4a, C3a, and C5a. RESULTS: Women who developed early-onset preeclampsia as compared with the term pregnant control group had significantly higher (p=0.04) median amniotic fluid C3a levels (318.7 ng/mL vs 254.5 ng/mL).

The goal of this study was to determine whether the combination of chemotherapeutics with DNP would increase cell death in ovarian CSCs. METHODS: CSCs were isolated from the human epithelial ovarian cancer cell (EOC) line SKOV-3. Isolation was achieved utilizing the magnetic-activated cell sorting technique for CD44 + CD117 + cells via a CD44 or CD117 antibody coupled to magnetic beads. Isolated CSCs were treated with and without chemotherapy (taxotere (0.3 \u00b5M or cisplatin 50 \u00b5M) with or without increasing doses of DNP (0.125, 0.25, or 0.5 mM) for 72 hours followed by evaluation of proliferation utilizing the MTT cytotoxicity assay. RESULTS: CSCs isolated from SKOV-3 cells exhibited a 2.9, 10.9, and 2.8 fold increase in pluripotency markers Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2, respectively, as compared to SKOV-3 EOC cells (p<0.05). There was no effect on viability when CSCs were treated with either taxotere or cisplatin. Past studies have shown that BPA exposure in mice and monkeys disrupts meiotic activation and maturation in oocytes. Of concern, BPA has been identified in aspirates of ovarian follicular fluid collected from women with fertility issues, and higher urinary BPA levels in women undergoing assisted reproduction are associated with reduced numbers of oocytes retrieved and lower fertilization rates. We became interested in BPA because of its known ability to influence estrogen receptor (ER) signaling, the latter of which we have shown in as-yet unpublished studies to serve as a primary mechanism supporting the differentiation of oogonial stem cells ( Medicine 2012; 18:413-21] , was significantly enhanced by BPA in both a dose-and time-dependent manner. The peak response to BPA was detected at 72 hours of culture, with the highest dose of BPA leading to a 5-fold enhancement of IVD oocyte formation over control levels (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study we are aware of that ties endocrine disruptor exposure to alterations in the oogenic capacity of female germline stem cells in any species. We are currently assessing whether BPA interacts with ER signaling to activate the meiotic machinery in OSCs (e.g., Stra8, Sycp3) in a manner that resembles the response of OSCs to estrogen stimulation.

Trophoblast stem cells isolated from mouse blastocysts have taught us a great deal about murine placental development, but a 'true' human trophoblast stem cell model has yet to be established. Hoechst low side-populations are characteristic of stem cells from a variety of tissues. We have previously isolated a Hoechst side-population of trophoblasts from first trimester placentae that are 98.5% pure and have a distinct gene expression profile from mature trophoblast populations, including the expression of genes associated with pluripotency and murine trophoblast stem cells. This work aimed to determine whether a similar population of cells are resident in term placentae. METHODS: 10g samples of term placenta underwent sequential trypsin and DNAse digest. The supernatant was collected, red blood cells lysed, and mesenchymal cells were depleted by plastic adhesion. Non-adherent cells were stained using Hoechst 33342 and a side-population identified by flow cytometry. Side-population cells were FACS sorted into Matrigel coated wells and dual immunofluorescence was used to determine the expression of the trophoblast marker cytokeratin-7 and either vimentin or HLA-G.",

We then generated Sox21 over-expressing and knockdown stable TS cell lines and evaluated their differentiation profiles by qPCR using lineage specific primers. Sox21-overexpressing cells during differentiation showed an increased expression of both spongiotrophoblast and trophoblast giant cell (TGC) markers, while expression of labyrinthine markers, in particular Gcm1, were significantly reduced. By contrast, Sox21-knockdown cells showed reduction of spongiotrophoblast and TGC markers and enhanced expression of labyrinthine markers compared to controls. Finally, TS cells overexpressing Sox21 during differentiation showed a 2.5-fold increase in the number of invasive trophoblast giant cells compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results implicate Sox21 specifically in the regulation of spongiotrophoblast and giant cells differentiation and establish a new mechanism through which trophoblast sublineages are specified following FGF4 withdrawal.

This procedure was repeated twice, alternating right to left nostril with an interval of one minute between administrations. The rat pups received a total of 600'000 cells. Animals were sacrificed 7 days after the application of the cells. Fixed brains were collected, embedded in paraffin or snap frozen and sectioned. Several immunohistochemical analyses followed. RESULTS: Transplanted cells were found in the layers of the olfactory bulb (OB), the cerebral cortex, thalamus and the hippocampus. The amount of cells was highest in the OB. Animals treated with transnasally delivered stem cells showed significantly decreased gliosis compared to untreated animals. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that transnasal delivery of WJ-MSC to the newborn brain after perinatal brain damage is successful. The cells not only migrate the brain, but also decrease scar formation and improve neurogenesis.

Furthermore, the differences between WJ-MSC derived from term or preterm deliveries were evaluated. Additionally the secretome of WJ-MSC was analyzed by mass spectroscopy and with a membrane-based antibody array. RESULTS: Over 500 secreted proteins were identified. Several of these proteins are involved in glio-and neurogenesis. Hippocampal NPC at passage 3 showed an increased expression of glial markers such as myelin basic protein (Mbp), galactocerebroside or glial fibrillary acidic protein (Gfap) after exposure to WJ-MSC-conditioned medium (CM) or after direct contact to WJ-MSC. Interestingly, WJ-MSC from term deliveries induced more strongly the expression of glial markers when compared to preterm. The co-culture had a more prominent effect on the expression of glial markers compared to CM, especially regarding the oligodendroglial markers. four different differentiation agents were added to drive cardiomyocyte differentiation. The first differentiation medium included Y27632, a ROCK inhibitor, CHIR99021, a GSK3 inhibitor that enables self-renewal of stem cells, and IWP-2, a Wnt signaling inhibitor, in RPMI/B-27 without insulin. The remaining three differentiation agents included 10 uM 5-azacytidine, 10 nM oxytocin (OT), and 100 nM OT, respectively. After 72 hours, all wells were replaced with complete medium. Control group wells received complete medium only. 14 days after differentiation, total RNA was extracted and expression of cardiomyocyte markers (NKX2-5, cTnT, cTnI, and ISL1) was analyzed by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Treatment with OT yielded a dose-responsive increase in ISL1 and cTnI expression. 100 nM OT treatment resulted in significant 10-fold increase in ISL1 expression. Treatment with 10 nM OT resulted in a significant increase (2-fold) in cTnT expression. 10 nM OT and 100 nM OT treatments did not induce significant expression of NKX2-5. Treatment with conventional agents Y27632/CHIR99021/IWP-2 or 5-azacytidine did not result in significant increases in cardiomyocyte marker gene expression. Further, EDSC treated with 100 nM OT showed morphological changes suggestive of cardiomyocyte differentiation. T-eSF control (123 >1.5 fold) and IV-eSF endo vs. eSF control (134 >1.5 fold) included 50 genes in common, 72 unique to T-eSF endo vs. T-eSF control , and 84 unique to IV-eSF endo vs. eSF control . Pathway analysis showed in IV-eSF endo vs. eSF control increased proteolysis, decreased gene expression, and decreased lipid metabolism. T-eSF endo vs. T-eSF control uniquely showed increased cellular migration/recruitment/immune cell trafficking/ activation, and decreased cellular differentiation/development. T-eSF control and IV-eSF control but not T-eSF endo and IV-eSF endo responded to P4 with IGFBP1 secretion. CONCLUSIONS: Common DEG and P4-resistance in T-eSF endo and IV-eSF endo indicate changes derive from progenitors transmitted to differentiated lineage. Unique changes in T-eSF endo and IV-eSF endo T-eSF endo suggest the disease niche in endometriosis result in changes during eSF lineage commitment/differentiation/function contributing to the disease phenotype.

Zearalenone is a potent estrogenic mycotoxin that is broadly found in the diet of the US population. The purpose of this project was to assess whether alterations in placental hormone secretion by an environmentally-relevant concentration of zearalenone results from dysregulation of steroid metabolizing and syncytialization genes. METHODS: Human embryonic stem (hES, WA09/H9) cells were differentiated to trophoblasts using media supplemented with bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4). Cells were treated with vehicle, zearalenone (1 ng/ml), or 17\u03b2-estradiol (1ng/ml) as a positive estrogenic control. Media was collected on days 2, 4, 6, and 8 and RNA extracted from cells on day 8 for mRNA profiling. Progesterone and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) were measured by ELISA. Quantitative PCR was used to measure expression of trophoblast progenitors (CDX2) and steroidogenesis in trophoblasts (CYP11A1, hCGA, hCGB, syncytin). RPL13A was used as a reference gene. RESULTS: In cells exposed to BMP4 and zearalenone, progesterone and hCG levels in media were decreased 40% and 80%, respectively, compared to hES cells treated only with BMP4. This corresponded with reduced mRNA expression of CYP11A1, hCGA, and hCGB that was 24-37% of control cells. No significant difference in CDX2 or syncytin mRNA were observed with zearalenone treatment, although they tended to be reduced. Similar results were observed with 17\u03b2-estradiol treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired secretion of progesterone and hCG from differentiating trophoblasts may result from down-regulation of steroidrelated genes following zearalenone exposure.",

HIF-1\u03b1 protein expression is mainly regulated by protein degradation in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, suggesting that hypoxia induces HIF-1\u03b1 by inhibiting the degradation of HIF-1 in proteasomes. The accumulation of HIF-1\u03b1 protein may negatively regulate mRNA expression of HIF-1\u03b1 at the transcriptional level in the primary cultured UL cells. Inflammatory pathways leading to disordered collagen deposition and changes in extracellular matrix play a role in the pathogenesis of both uterine fibroids and aortic aneurysms. However, there seems to be an opposing response to inflammatory markers in that collagen causes bulk and stiffness in fibroids, but weakness in vasculature. In addition, fibroids undergo smooth muscle cell proliferation while there is loss of smooth muscle cells at the site of aneurysms. If there is a systemic mechanism behind the different response, we would expect that women who develop fibroids would be at lower risk for aneurysm. Using a population-based design, we looked at the association of fibroids and aortic or peripheral aneurysm. METHODS: Using the Rochester Epidemiology Project recordslinkage system, we identified 6,759 reproductive aged women with a clinical diagnosis of fibroids between 1981 and 2010 in Olmsted County, Minnesota. We matched these women to referent women of similar age who did not have a diagnosis of fibroids. Index date was the date of fibroid diagnosis for each matched pair. A subset of 3,728 matched pairs was identified with women that did not undergo hysterectomy before index or for at least one year after index to reduce the effect that hysterectomy would have on outcomes. The risk of de novo aortic or peripheral aneurysms, defined by diagnostic codes, was estimated using Cox proportional hazards models which excluded women with aneurysms diagnosed before index. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 11.7 years, 140 women with fibroids and 161 referent women were diagnosed with de novo aortic or peripheral aneurysm (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64, 1.00). In the subset of women that did not undergo hysterectomy, the relative risk of aneurysm was significantly lower among women with fibroids compared to referent women (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53, 0.99).",

To investigate this question, we studied women with a diagnosis of fibroids who did not undergo hysterectomy compared with age-matched controls. METHODS: Using the Rochester Epidemiology Project records-linkage system, we identified 3,728 women diagnosed with fibroids between 1981 and 2010 in Olmsted County, Minnesota who did not undergo hysterectomy for at least one year after their fibroid diagnosis.

We also assessed de novo CV disease after index using a Cox proportional hazards model with age as the time scale. Women with CV disease before index were excluded from the analysis of de novo disease. RESULTS: Fibroids were significantly associated with hyperlipidemia, obesity, and polycystic ovarian syndrome.

We demonstrated the co-localization of Stro-1/CD44 with other stem cell markers:Oct-4, c-kit, nanog, validating their undifferentiated status and their distribution in Eker uterus. The IHC shows a significantly higher number of stem cells in the cervix compared to uterine horns, corroborating these results by flow cytometry (P<0.05). The quantification of in vivo oxygenation as well as pimonidazole, CAIX and HIF-\u03b1 staining also demonstrated that the pO2 levels in cervix were significantly lower than in uterine horns(p\u00a30.0014) confirming its hypoxic status. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we identified the myometrial stem cell niche by stem cell markers and we have established an association of hypoxic niches in uterine cervix which is the primary location of fibroids in Eker rat model.These observations could provide a putative mechanism by which myometrial stem cells regulate transformations into tumor initiating cells. We performed genome wide microarray (Affymetrix HGU133plus2) and RNA-seq (Illumina Hiseq) analysis and determined the MED12 mutation status for each sample RESULTS: Unsupervised clustering revealed a clear separation between myometrium and fibroid samples. MED12 mutated samples showed greatest divergence from the normal samples. This was reflected also in expression of individual genes, such as RAD51B and DCX. GnRH agonist treatment induced a sub-clustering within both the myometrium and fibroids but did not restore normal myometrial expression pattern. Interestingly, MED12 wild type fibroids displayed stronger changes in expression after GnRH treatment than MED12 mutated fibroids. In particular, likely target genes of polycomb transcription factor SUZ12 remained strongly up-regulated in MED12 mutated fibroids even after GnRH treatment. CONCLUSIONS: GnRH agonist treatment reveals distinct differences in the expression profiles of fibroid and myometrial tissue, albeit treatment did not induce a normal myometrial expression pattern. Specifically, MED12 status seemed to play a role in the strength of gene expressional changes induced by GnRH agonist treated fibroid tissues. Further analysis of these changes might lead to better understanding of both fibroid aetiology and individual differences in response to GnRH agonist treatment. Eventhough the safety profile of replication-incompetent adenoviruses is outstanding, there is still a need for minimizing any potential spread delivery beyond the fibroid lesion to avoid any possible adverse reactions.",

Overactive bladder syndrome (OBS) is a common health problem, mainly affect women in their reproductive and postmenopausal years. We have shown that vitamin D elicits a robust anti-inflammatory response in human myometrial cells (Thota et. al., 2013) . We hypothesize that vitamin D deficiency in a risk factor for OBS, which induces a heightened inflammatory microenvironment in the urinary bladder wall leading to hyper-excitability and premature contractions of the detrusor muscle. In the current study, we aimed to assess the effect of vitamin D on the expression profile of inflammation-mediating cytokines and chemokines in human detrusor smooth muscle (DSM) cells. METHODS: Primary human DSM cells established from normal female urinary bladder wall specimen were cultured in smooth muscle basal medium supplemented with 5% FBS, human epidermal growth factor (5 ng/ml), recombinant human fibroblast growth factor (5 mcg/ml), insulin (5 mcg/ml), 0.1% gentamicin sulfate, and amphotericin B. DSM cells were treated in triplicate with 100 nmol/L of 1, 25 dihydroxy vitamin D 3 dissolved in ethanol in the presence of 5% charcoal-treated FBS for 24 hours. Total RNA was extracted from the control and vitamin D (100 nmol/ L)-treated cells. The Complementary DNA (cDNA) prepared was subjected to superarray quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using Acute Inflammation Response H96 array panels (Biorad). The qPCR data and cycle threshold (Ct) values were analyzed using software obtained from Biorad. A 2-fold change in gene expression compared to control is considered significant. RESULTS: In vitamin D treated cells versus control, superarray analysis revealed significant (P<0.05) expression downregulation of the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL)-2, the proinflammatory cytokine IL-13, alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M), apolipoprotein A-I, coagulation factor II (thrombin) receptor-like 1, hemoglobin alpha-2, interleukin 6 signal transducer and elastase 'neutrophil expressed'. Interestingly, vitamin D treatment caused significant (P<0.05) upregulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in treated versus untreated control detrusor muscle cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that vitamin D exerts robust anti-inflammatory effect in female detrusor muscle cells. Further in vivo evaluation of vitamin D and its analogues in animal models of overactive bladder syndrome is warranted. Since patient race may significantly affect allele frequencies, only data from non-hispanic Caucasian women were included for genetic analysis. IL-4 (rs22432250) genotypes were determined by real-time PCR-based Taqman Allelic Discrimination (ABI). Data were analyzed by X 2 analysis. RESULTS: White controls had the expected risk allele frequency of 14-15%.

Adjusted odds ratios showed that total and externalizing behavior problems from age 5 years onward significantly increased the risk of earlier FSI for males. In females, externalizing problems from age 10 years increased the risk for earlier FSI. Internalizing problems at ages 8 and 10 were significantly associated with early FSI for boys but not girls. CONCLUSIONS: Externalizing behavior from as early as five in boys and 10 in girls is a significant risk factor for earlier age at FSI. Adolescent sexual health promotion should consider early intervention in children with behavior problems, particularly boys.",

The objective of the current study was to evaluate transcriptomic effects of a non-toxic 10% UPG on co-cultured eEC and eSF to identify alternative mechanisms that may contribute to HIV infection risk. METHODS: An eEC/eSF co-culture system used previously to measure production of cytokines after treatment with either N9 or UPG was utilized here. eEC in co-culture (with monoculture controls) with eSF were treated with 10% UPG for 12.5h. RNA was collected for microarray analysis. For co-culture studies, only eEC were in direct contact with UPG; whereas eSF was affected by eEC paracrine effects. For monoculture, both cells were directly exposed to UPG. Data were analyzed by Genespring, and Ingenuity Pathways Analysis was used to analyze biofunctional pathways affected by differentially expressed genes (p<0.05, 1.5 fold change).",

Interestingly, for co-cultured eEC and eSF, exposure to UPG resulted in down-regulation (negative Z score < -1.5) of genes associated with cellular differentiation, and increase in genes associated with tumor proliferation (positive Z score >1.5). The majority of genes associated with these changes centered on cytokines, angiogenic factors, and oncogenes. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to UPG in monocultured cells stimulated a pro-inflammatory effect similar to reported effects of N9. However, in co-culture exposure to UPG actually promoted expression of tumorigenic genes. Together, these results suggest differential mechanisms by which UPG can affect the endometrial environment and this should be considered when testing for microbicide safety.

Of the patients with positive margins, 45.9 % of these patients were considered to be immuno-compromised due to factors such as chronic steroid use and smoking, chemotherapy or HIV positivity. The recurrence of abnormal pap smears within 2 years of an excisional procedure was 18.91% in the margin negative group and 28.54% in the margin positive group (P <0.05). The positive predictive value of cervical biopsy for determining CIN II on an excisional procedure was 85.2%. Of women with pregnancy outcome data, we found 19 patients with previous CIN II who had an excisional procedure and later had a pregnancy. Of these 19 patients, 7 patients had a preterm delivery; however 4 of these patients had a history of prior preterm delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Positive surgical margins on LEEP/cone biopsy is not uncommon and increases the risk for abnormal cervical cytology in the subsequent years post-procedure. Cervical biopsies when performed by trained physicians correlate well with final pathology on LEEP or cone. Risk factor assessment continues to be important in following patients.

We aim to determine whether alterations in the activity of these enzymes can be demonstrated by measuring the levels of cortisol and androgen metabolites in random urine samples of patients with PCOS. METHODS: Twenty-two patients who met the Rotterdam criteria for PCOS and 12 age-matched controls were enrolled in an IRB-approved case-control study. BMI, waist-to-hip circumference, and ethnicity of each patient were also documented. We collected a random urine sample from each patient and levels of urinary androgen and cortisol metabolites were measured using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Higher levels of urinary tetrahydrocortisone (THE), the metabolite of cortisone, were noted in patients with PCOS (p=0.03). There was also a statistically significant increase in the levels of urinary androsterone, the major metabolite of dihydrotestosterone, in patients with PCOS (p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: There is a statistically significant increase in levels of urinary metabolites of cortisone and dihydrotestosterone, indicating the role of both 11 \u03b2-HSD-1 andDHT in the pathogenesis of PCOS. This change in enzymatic activity correlates with the hyperandrogenism observed in patients with PCOS and offers an alternative therapeutic target in the treatment of this complex disorder. Change in motility was assessed as a function of BMI. RESULTS: There is a positive correlation between increasing BMI and a beneficial effect of opiorphin; the benefit of opiorphin supplements on sperm motility and forward progression was greatest in the most obese men. When comparing the change in motility after addition of opiorphin, the obese men's sperm had a 1.12-fold increase in motility over the non-obese men. The obese men's forward progression had a 1.27-fold increase which was statistically significant. More than twice as many obese men with asthenozoospermia achieved normal motility (as defined by WHO) after addition of opiorphin compared to non-obese men with asthenozoospermia. CONCLUSIONS: These exciting preliminary data may offer treatment alternatives to obese men who suffer from infertility due to asthenozoospermia. The process of freezing / thawing causes serious structural and functional modifications in sperm samples. The presence of proteins in the seminal plasma is important for correction of these damages. Several tests have been proposed to predict the post-thaw sperm recovery, however the current methods are expensive and timeconsuming.

Published studies comparing COS initiated in the luteal phase to COS initiated in the follicular phase were included. With IRB approval, primary data from our center was also included. Case reports were excluded. Our primary outcome was number of oocytes retrieved. Secondary outcomes included duration of stimulation and oocyte fertilization rates. Meta-analysis data was synthesized with a DerSimonion-Laird random effects model. Results are reported as weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Four studies with a total of 238 women were included along with our center's primary data (Boots, n=43; Cakmak, n=125; Maman, n=18; Suikkari, n= 12; vonWolff, n=40) . No differences were noted in the number of oocytes retrieved from women undergoing COS initiated in the luteal phase versus the follicular phase (WMD: 0.02, 95% CI: -1.8-1.8) nor were any differences noted in the duration of COS (WMD: 0.06, 95% CI:-2.5-2.6) between the two groups. Oocyte fertilization rates were significantly higher in women initiating COS in the luteal phase (WMD: 0.16, 95% CI: 0.13-0.19). CONCLUSIONS: Initiating COS in the luteal phase does not compromise the number or quality of oocytes retrieved (based on fertilization rates), and duration of stimulation is no different between COS initiated in the luteal phase or the follicular phase. COS should be offered as soon as possible in women who need expedited fertility preservation. However, the mechanism whereby administration of \u03b1-GalCer leads to PTB and whether it causes an expansion of NKT cells in pregnant mice is unknown. A breakdown of maternal-fetal tolerance is considered a mechanism of disease in PTB. Maternal-fetal tolerance is maintained by a balance between anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory T cells. The aims of this study were to determine whether administration of \u03b1-GalCer (1) causes an expansion of NKT cells in pregnant mice and (2) alters the maternal T-cell repertoire. METHODS: Pregnant B6 mice were injected with 2 \u00b5g of \u03b1-GalCer (n=8) or DMSO (n=6) as a control at 16.5 days post-coitum. After 6 hours, mice were euthanized and the spleen, uterine-draining lymph nodes, and uterine and decidual tissues were harvested. Leukocytes were isolated for immunophenotyping. Within the NKT-cell gate (CD1dtetramer+DX5+) These include cells from the fetal skin, respiratory system, urinary and gastrointestinal tracts, along with populations of stem cells (AFS). AFS cells are characterized by their capacity for self-renewal and their ability to differentiate to toward lineages representative of all three germ layers including Lin-cells with a hematopoietic potential. Amniotic fluid may have also an immuno-priviledged status. We sought to characterize B cells population and their potential activation in different mice clones.",

            "text": "The Pregnancy is an exceptional immunological phenomenon because tolerance is created towards the semi-allogeneic cells of the fetus. We do know that dysfunction of tolerance is associated with pregnancy disorders and that the maternal immune system memorizes fetal antigens thought to prevent disorders in subsequent pregnancies. This study aims to analyze the effects of pregnancy on memory T lymphocytes in order to reveal possible mechanisms responsible for tolerance towards the fetus. METHODS: Using flow cytometry, CD4+ and CD8+ memory T lymphocytes were analyzed in the peripheral blood of 14 healthy nulligravid and 9 healthy primigravid women. Effector memory (EM; CD45RO+CCR7-), central memory (CM; CD45RO+CCR7+), na\u00efve (CD45RO-CCR7+) and effector (CD45RO-CCR7-) T lymphocytes were distinguished. Monoclonal antibody CD69 was used to detect their activation status. Comparison was done using Mann-Whitney U-test; p<0.05. RESULTS: In primigravidae, proportions of CD4+ EM cells were significantly higher (p=0.022) and proportions of CD4+ CM cells were significantly lower compared to nulligravidae (p=0.027). Significantly higher percentages of CD4+ CM cells were activated in primigravidae (p=0.003). Whereas CD4+ na\u00efve cell proportions were lower (p=0.064), CD4+ effector cells were higher in primigravid women in comparison to nulligravid women (p=0.014). Percentages of CD8+ memory cell (sub) populations did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, pregnancy affects maternal CD4+ memory cells in peripheral blood. Presumably, conversion of CD4+ CM to EM cells occurs due to fetal antigen exposure. Also CD4+ na\u00efve cells seem to proliferate during pregnancy. Most likely to memory and effector cells. Altogether, this study implies that memory cells play a role in maternal immune tolerance. TLR (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7/8, 9) ligands throughout pregnancy and postpartum. METHODS: A prospective cohort of 33 women with uncomplicated pregnancies had peripheral blood collected at 1)10-12wks, 2)at 26-28 wks, 3)at delivery, and 4)6wks postpartum. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and stimulated with TLR ligands (see Table 1 ) for 18h, then preserved. Stained with fluorescent antibodies to identify DCs, and intracellular IL-6,IFNa, IL-12 and TNFa. 10-channel flow cytometry on a 3-laser LSR II instrument allowed identification of DCs and % expressing each cytokine. Repeated measures-adjusted ANOVA was used to evaluate the relationship between DC cytokine production at different timepoints. RESULTS: From 40 total comparisons (9 TLR ligands and control, by 4 measured cytokines), 11 demonstrated significant (p<0.05) differences across pregnancy and postpartum and are summarized in Table 1 . Broadly, TNFa and IL6 stimulated production tended to decrease across pregnancy while IL-12 and IFNa increased. Concerning B1 B cells, we observed a decrease in(CD20 + CD27 + CD43 + ) CD11bnumbers from the first to the third trimester of pregnancy. Unlike CD11b -, CD11b + B1 B cells were augmented in pregnant women.",

However, excessive uterine distension has been associated with preterm labour (PTL). Mechanical stretch has been shown to affect the fetal membranes, including the amnion though this has not been extensively investigation. Understanding the mechanisms behind these stretch-induced changes will allow the use of potential therapeutic targets to prevent PTL. METHODS: Human amnion epithelial cells, obtained from consenting women undergoing term elective caesarean section, were subjected to 11% mechanical stretch. In order to confirm stretch efficiency, COX-2 protein levels were investigated by western analysis. In addition, total RNA was extracted from these cells using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, UK) and converted to cDNA. QPCR was carried out using a Rotor-Gene TM (Qiagen, UK) to investigate COX-2 and cytokine mRNA expression. An ELISA multiplex assay was used to detect levels of eotaxin-1, IL-8 and MCP-1 from cultured supernatant of amnion cells after 6 and 12 hours of 11% mechanical stretch. RESULTS: Following 11% mechanical stretch, COX-2 protein levels showed a distinct increase particularly after 6 and 12 hours. COX-2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and TGF-\u03b2 mRNA levels all appeared to increase following 12 and 24 hours stretch (n=12). Observed concentrations in the supernatant showed statistically significant differences. Both MCP-1 and eotaxin-1 increased, 1.5 and 3.5 fold respectively, after 12 hours; MCP-1 and IL-8 demonstrated an increase, 2 and 0.5 fold respectively, after 24 hours (n=8). Results are given as fold increases due to stretch above control cells (** p<0.01).",

In addition, these results suggest that it is feasible to stretch human amnion epithelial cells after in vitro culture and that this would be a useful model to study the role of stretch in amnion during pregnancy and at the time of parturition. For our study, the exposure of interest was race and the primary outcome was the rate of cervical shortening (mm/week), which was obtained by dividing the difference in mm between the first and second cervical length measurements by the time difference. African American women were compared to other races, which included Caucasian and Hispanic. A subgroup analysis was also performed to determine if racial disparities in rate of cervical shortening exist among women who delivered preterm. Multiple regression was used to control for possible confounders. RESULTS: 2998 women with singleton pregnancies were included. 1874 were African American, 1124 were other races. African American women had a shorter mean CL, were more likely to have a CL < 25 mm, and to have a PTB, however they had similar rates of cervical shortening between the two exams compared to other races. *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: African American women were more likely to have a CL < 25 mm at 22-24 weeks and 26-28 weeks and deliver preterm but they did not have a faster rate of cervical shortening compared to other races. Premature remodeling of the cervix may be a contributing factor to the complex mechanism that initiates preterm labor. Based upon evidence in rodents, the present study tested the hypothesis that increased presence of macrophages is associated with remodeling of the cervix in preterm and term birth. METHODS: Cervical biopsies were obtained from 26 women (~50 mm 2 , n=7-9/group) after vaginal delivery with preterm labor (PTL) and term labor (TL), prepartum at term not in labor, (TNIL), as well as from 3 nonpregnant women (NP). The study was approved by local Ethics Committee and the subjects gave their informed consent. Tissues were fixed, paraffin-embedded, sectioned, and processed to identify cell nuclei (CN) with methyl green counterstain and CD68 macrophages (M\u03d5) by immunohistochemistry. CN and M\u03d5 were counted in photomicrographs over defined subepithelium and center subregions. M\u03d5 numbers were normalized to CN/volume to account for individual variations and tissue hypertrophy.",

In cervical biopsies, extravascular red blood cells were present in most tissue in PTL and TL groups, but absent in TNIL and NP women. Although cell numbers/volume varied between and within subregions, CN density was reduced in the cervix from pregnant women versus that in NP women. However, CN density was not different among TNIL, TL, and PTL groups. There were big individual differences in distribution of Mjs in cervical epithelium with no obvious differences between the groups. In NP women, Mjs were concentrated in subepithelium, especially near blood vessels, and sparsely distributed in the center region. By contrast, in the cervix from pregnant women, Mjs were more abundant throughout the biopsy tissue and present within blood vessels. Significantly increased numbers of M\u03d5 were found in women in PTL and TL groups vs that in NP women. CONCLUSIONS: Increased presence of macrophages is associated with remodeling of the cervix in preterm and term birth. Diverse patient histories, variations in morphology, and small biopsy area may limit accurate resolution of cellular characteristics that define processes that remodels the cervix with preterm birth and at term. We performed T2 Cube 3D FSE MRI scans of the pelvic region of each patient and generated anatomically correct FE models of the lower uterine segment and cervix.

CONCLUSIONS: Cervical shortening is a complex function of multiple factors: geometry, cervical properties, and loading. Here we used FE techniques to show collagen properties are a critical factor influencing cervical shortening. Adhesion between the fetal membranes and cervix also affected cervical length, suggesting that detachment could play a significant role in cervical shortening. To analyze the specific contribution of choriodecidual leukocytes to MMP-9 secretion and activation in the intrauterine microenvironment, we examined intrauterine leukocytes. METHODS: Placentae and amniochorion samples were obtained from women at term gestation. Leukocytes were obtained from intervillous placental blood and from choriodecidua and maintained in culture up to 72 h. Gelatinase activity was determined by zymography and using specific substrates. MMPs in the culture media were measured by MultiAnalyte Profiling. Presence of a potential activator of pro-MMP-9 was monitored using a biotin-labeled pro-MMP-9. To characterize the activator of pro-MMP-9 in the culture media, a set of blocking monoclonal anti human MMPs were used. RESULTS: Leukocytes spontaneously secreted proMMP-9 after 24 h. Secretion increased significantly at 48 h, 3059.32 \u00b1 621 in placental leukocytes and 5,310.2 \u00b1 845 in choriodecidual cells (p<0.05). The active form of MMP-9 was appreciable at this time. Findings were confirmed with a specific MMP-9 activity assay and using the labeled pro-MMP-9. A significant increase in MMP-3 secretion was observed since 48 hours in culture (0.22 \u00b1 0.14 pg/mg protein; p < 0.05) compared with 24 hours (0.0142 \u00b1 0.0054 pg/mg protein) and up to 72 hours (0,600 \u00b1 0.0978 pg/ mg protein; p <0.05). Activity of MMP-9 decreased significantly when adding an anti MMP-3 antibody to the culture media. CONCLUSIONS: Upon homing in the intrauterine environment, leukocytes are capable of producing different mediators involved in the degradation of the connective tissue. We have shown that placental blood and choriodecidual leukocytes from human term pregnancies are able to secrete large amounts of MMP-9 as well as the activator. We also demonstrated that MMP-3 plays a major role in such activation process. INTRODUCTION: Progesterone sustains pregnancy while local withdrawal of progesterone may mediate prepartum remodeling of the cervix. Whether a reduction in cells that directly respond to genomic actions of progesterone or a shift in progesterone receptor (PR) isoforms contribute to degradation of the extracellular matrix in the prepartum cervix is not known. Thus prepartum cervix remodeling, presumed related to loss of trophic effects of progesterone, was hypothesized to be mediated by a decline in the population of stromal cells that express PR.",

Sections were processed with picrosirius red to assess extracellular collagen content and structure or by immunohistochemistry to identify PR (A+B isoforms, #3153, Cell Signaling Tech.) and counterstained with methyl green to assess cell nuclei/volume (CN), an indicator of tissue hypertrophy that varies with subregion morphology across sections, individuals, and groups (PMID24339918). Cervix sections from peripartum PGRBKO mice lacking the PRB isoform were similarly processed to count PRA cells. RESULTS: Extracellular collagen content and structure declined with pregnancy and before birth. The cervix hypertrophied with pregnancy because CN density declined in pregnant mice and more so before birth (p<0.05; D18<D15<NP). PR-stained cells were abundant in the cervix across all groups. Nearly half of all stromal cells stained for PR and numbers did not vary among groups of pregnant mice or relative to NP controls. Similar numbers of stromal cells stained for PR In sections from the cervix of pre-and postpartum PGRBKO mice. Thus, the prepartum cervix had a similar density of PR-stained stromal cells in CD-1 mice as in PGRBKO mice with only the PRA-isoform. CONCLUSIONS: Abundant PR-stained stromal cells in the cervix from pregnant, postpartum, and NP mice suggests that the number of PR-containing cells cannot account for loss of genomic responses to progesterone that may drive extracellular collagen degradation in the cervix prior to birth. Since transformation of cervix structure and timing of birth are similar in PGRBKO and CD-1 mice, the findings support the alternative possibility that PRA-mediated actions, rather than loss of PRB effects, contribute to the final common mechanism for remodeling in the process of parturition.

Animal models are commonly used to study cervical softening. However, softening in animal pregnancy may not reflect changes in the human cervix. Our objective was to develop a model for studying the effect of steroid hormones on mechanical strength of cervical tissue using a three-dimensional culture method and human cervical fibroblasts. METHODS: Fibroblasts were obtained from cervical biopsies of non-pregnant premenopausal women. Fibroblasts from passage 5 were seeded on cylindrical silk scaffolds using a previously described, three-dimensional (3D) culture protocol. In the present experiment, the cylindrical scaffolds were positioned end-to-end such that newly formed tissue filled the gap between the two scaffolds, essentially bonding the scaffolds together. At the end of the six week experiment, scaffolds were evaluated for H&E histology and mechanical strength. To measure mechanical strength, scaffolds were attached to a testing fixture and pulled apart. The peak force at failure was recorded, which measured the strength of the newly formed tissue filling the gap. Culture media included DMEM + 10% charcoal stripped FBS and three hormone conditions: 1) estradiol (E2) 10-8M alone, 2) estradiol 10-8M + progesterone (P4) 10-6M, and 3) vehicle control. Experiments were repeated in duplicate with cells from two different women. RESULTS: Cervical cells reliably synthesized new tissue that filled the gap between the two scaffolds. The presence of E2 without P4 was associated with increased mechanical strength compared with E2+P4 and vehicle control (p < .01). Histology correlated with mechanical testingimproved tissue synthesis was seen with E2 without P4 compared with E2+P4 and vehicle control. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure of scaffolds to E2 resulted in increased tissue production, which was associated increased tissue strength. P4 opposed this effect. Ongoing experiments are exploring the mechanism of these observed responses. This hormonally-responsive in vitro culture system could be useful for studying biochemical mechanisms of cervical softening during pregnancy. propagation is faster in stiffer tissues. We studied SWS in ex vivo cervices of rhesus monkeys to determine whether SWS estimates are sensitive enough to differentiate between ripened and unripened cervical tissues. METHODS: SWS were estimated in cervix specimens (n=29) from rhesus macaque monkeys, a subset of which were ripened with misoprostol (n=13). The cervix specimens were pinned to a piece of sound absorbing rubber and placed in a saline solution. A Siemens Acuson S2000 and 9L4 transducer, which was attached to a translation stage and aligned parallel to cervical canal, were used to generate and track shear waves in regions of interest within each specimen. SWS measurements were made at predetermined locations from distal to proximal ends of the specimen on both the anterior and posterior sides, with at least 5 replicate measures at each location. Displacements were calculated using the Loupas' routine and SWS were estimated with the RANSAC algorithm. SWS from middle location and mid-proximal location (the location midway between middle and proximal end) were used to compare SWS between ripened and unripened groups.",

Cells were subcultured and transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding human telomerase (hTERT) under puromycin selection. Cells were immunolabeled for hTERT and vimentin to verify transduction of stromal myofibroblasts. Clonal cell lines were prepared and immunostained for hTERT and vimentin. Parental and cloned cell lines were primed for 5-7 days with 17\u03b2-E 2 (10 -8 M) followed by extraction of total RNA and protein for estrogen receptor-\u03b1 (ER-\u03b1) and PR expression for qRT-PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. RESULTS: In clonal hTERT CX cells, we detected uniform expression of nuclear hTERT, ER-\u03b1 and PR expression.

The alteration in TLR2 and TLR4 expression levels at 10-minute duration might be correlated to non-transcriptional (non-nuclear) effects of E 2 , which appears within seconds and subsides within about two hours. Although no alteration in the expression of TLR 2&4 were detected at two and 18-hour incubation periods, the possible nuclear effects of E 2 in TLRs expression is yet to be understood. Prolonging the duration of exposure may clarify modulatory effects of E 2 through genomic mechanisms. Interim analysis of EIS data is ongoing. We hypothesize that it will be particularly useful in assessing women with short CL. So far two symptomatic women with CL\u00a315mm have participated -both had positive FFN.

Further assessment will determine the optimum predictive electrical frequencies for CI measurement and the most predictive cut-off values of CI.

We ultimately aim to design a randomised controlled intervention study based on screening for PTB by EIS.

We determined that MYL9 is S-nitrosated in telemorized human uterine smooth muscle cells when 100\u00b5M GSNO was applied to FBS-free media. We have also isolated SMM from human uterine smooth muscle for use the in the actin motility assay. Baseline actin velocities have been established and will be used as a reference when comparing the velocity of S-nitrosated MYL9. CONCLUSIONS: While there is a vast body of research dedicated to actin-mediated contraction in smooth muscle cells, the role of S-nitrosation in this process is unknown. This important regulatory mechanism could have a major influence in regards to the regulation of smooth muscle relaxation, as well as the induction of labor. My research focuses on a unique NO-signaling exception and uses advanced methodology to discover MYL9 S-nitrosation associated with human sPTL and the impact of this post-translational modification of smooth muscle mechanics. Human myometrial RNA subtraction studies previously revealed a set of genes that had not been associated with labor and pregnancy but had strong correlations with estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1).

METHODS: Patch clamp electrophysiology was used to characterize TREK-1 currents in myocytes isolated from tissues from mothers who underwent cesarean section at different states of pregnancy (term/ preterm, laboring/non-laboring tissue). TREK-1 channel activity was also investigated in Human Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (hTRT) pregnant uterine myocytes to understand the efficacy of a model cell system that has been developed in our laboratory. RESULTS: We found that TREK-1 channel activity was disparate in myocytes isolated from women undergoing cesarean section at different states of pregnancy. The gestational regulation of TREK-1 correlated with electrophysiological data based on the finding that TREK-1 channel activity was reduced in laboring versus non-laboring tissues. It was also found that the hTRT model cell system exhibits TREK-1 currents that are similar to freshly isolated myocytes. We are continuing to study how TREK-1 currents are altered in preterm versus term tissues. CONCLUSIONS: TREK-1 currents which cause hyperpolarization of the cell membrane could play a significant role in uterine quiescence to term. Our lab has also developed a model cell line that can be used to study ion channels in pregnant myometrium. In the future TREK-1 could be targeted for the development of tocolytics to prevent preterm labor.",

External Ca 2+ entry was stimulated with the L-Type Calcium Channel (LTCC) agonist FPL64176 (1\u00b5M). Internal store Ca 2+ release was stimulated with thapsigargin (2\u00b5M). Channel-independent Ca 2+ entry was evaluated with the Ca 2+ ionophore, ionomycin (5\u00b5M). [Ca 2+ ]i with each treatment was quantified before and after addition of the H 2 S donor, NaHS (500\u00b5M). Ca 2+ stimulated P-MLC in PMCs after NaHS (0-1mM) was determined by western blot for P-MLC (ser19) normalized to total-MLC. In USM strips, tension change and P-MLC were assessed with NaHS (1mM) after initiating contraction in Ca 2+ free media with thapsigargin (5\u00b5M), ionomycin (10\u00b5M) plus Ca 2+ (15mM), or MLC phosphatase inhibitor, calyculin (0.2\u00b5M). Tension is quantified as area under the curve (g*s; AUC), and P-MLC/T-MLC by infrared fluorescence imaging. Data are mean\u00b1SEM, analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: In PMCs: LTCC dependent Ca 2+ entry (n=28) and internal store Ca 2+ release (n=55) were unaltered by NaHS. Channel-independent Ca 2+ entry is increased 3.5-fold by NaHS (n=26, p<0.0001). NaHS does not change Ca 2+ -dependent P-MLC in PMCs (n=5-9). In USM strips: NaHS inhibited Ca 2+ and calyculin-stimulated contractions by 6.2 and 1.6 fold, respectively (n=12, 11; p<0.005). In the same strips, NaHS increased P-MLC with Ca 2+ and calyculin by 1.8 and 1.2 fold respectively (n=12, 8; ns). The nitric oxide donor SNP (1mM) had no effect on calyculininduced contractions (n=6). CONCLUSIONS: NaHS profoundly inhibits myometrial contractions independent of intracellular Ca 2+ or Ca 2+ entry. NaHS relaxes USM strips without altering P-MLC, and the mechanism is distinct from nitric oxide.

            "text": "INTRODUCTION: Genes such as MMPs and TIMP2 appear to be involved in the process of parturition and the regulation of birth timing. MMP9(Gelatinase B) is an endopeptidase known to be involved in the breakdown of the extracellular matrix during cervical ripening and other physiological processes (Stygar et al.,2002) . TIMP2 is an endogenous MMP inhibitor that has been implicated in preterm premature rupture of membranes. CpG methylation in the gene promoter of MMP9 and body of the MMP9 inhibitor TIMP2 is associated with gestational age (Parets et al.,2013) . MMP9 activity is increased in the amniotic fluid of patients undergoing spontaneous rupture of membranes(term or preterm) and parturition(term or preterm) (Di Ferdinando et al.,2010; Maymon et al.,2000; Romero et al.,2002) . Secreted MMP9 has been implicated in initiating signaling events that regulate cellular contraction (Defawe et al.,2005; Kobayashi et al.,2014) and recent work indicates MMP2 and MMP9 inhibitors rapidly enhance the oxytocin-induced contractile response in rat myometrium (Yin et al.,2012) . We performed experiments to test the hypothesis that MMP9 activity is altered in preterm laboring myometrium where it may exert local effects on contractility. METHODS: Human myometrial tissue samples were collected under informed consent and with Institutional Review Board approval. TIMP-2 expression was assessed by semiquantitative western analysis and normalized to GAPDH expression. MMP9 expression and MMP-9 activity was assessed by western blot and gelatinase zymography. Data were compared by one-way ANOVA with p<0.01 considered significant. Localization in pregnant human myometrial tissue was assessed by immunofluorescent confocal microscopy. RESULTS: TIMP2 expression was lower in myometrial tissue from all pregnant groups(term in labor, term not in labor, preterm in labor, and preterm not in labor) compared to nonpregnant myometrial samples. Pro-MMP-9 and MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity was higher in preterm laboring myometrial tissue than in nonpregnant myometrial samples. Confocal microscopy showed MMP9 localized adjacent to myometrial cells in pregnant uterine tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary data indicate MMP activity is increased and TIMP2 activity is low in myometrium from preterm laboring patients. The localization of MMP9 adjacent to myometrial cells is consistent with a potential role in regulation of myometrial contractility as well as ECM degradation. Future work will determine if MMP9 can affect contractility in human myometrial tissue. Other factors associated with neonatal morbidity were:African-American race,Hispanic ethnicity,obesity and pre-eclampsia,HELLP or eclampsia. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, women with high ratios of ROM duration-to-labor duration were at increased risk of neonatal morbidity. Further prospective research is needed to determine if the ratio can assist obstetricians in identifying laboring women at risk for neonatal morbidity.",

INTRODUCTION: Due to neurobiological differences between males and females, the efficacy of neuroprotective strategies in preterm infants may differ by neonatal sex. We evaluated the effect of umbilical cord milking on morbidity and survival in extremely low gestational age males versus females. METHODS: We implemented a prospective observational trial of umbilical cord milking in preterm neonates <30 weeks gestation starting 9/2011. Infants underwent umbilical cord milking 3 times over a duration <30 seconds at delivery. We compared the milked group to a retrospective cohort delivered between 1/2010 and 8/2011. The primary analysis showed a significant reduction in the composite outcome of severe intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and death prior to hospital discharge (22% vs. 39%; OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31-0.93) (Patel et al., AJOG, 2014) . We conducted a secondary analysis evaluating the effect of umbilical cord milking on the same composite outcome in males versus females. Neonates with anomalies or aneuploidy were excluded from the analysis. A multivariable logistic regression model evaluated the association between umbilical cord milking and the composite outcome within sex strata. An interaction term tested heterogeneity across strata. RESULTS: We analyzed 187 males (n=101, milked group) and 150 females (n=77, milked group). In males, umbilical cord milking was associated with a significant decrease in composite outcome (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.2-0.8; p=0.009). In females, umbilical cord milking was not associated with the composite outcome (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.26-1.24). The p-value for the interaction term was 0.47, indicating no statistically significant difference in the effect of umbilical cord milking on the composite outcome between males and females when controlling for appropriate covariables, including gestational age, chorioamnionitis and placental abruption. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of umbilical cord milking on composite morbidity and survival in extremely low gestational age neonates is not different between males and females.",

Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA. INTRODUCTION: Our objective is to define the effect smoking has on pregnancy in relation to risk of stillbirth and neonatal demise. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study for US birth certificate data from 2011. We included all singleton births between 32-42 weeks gestation. Exclusion criteria were gestational age outside of 32-42 weeks, congenital anomalies and multiple gestation. A population specific birthweight distribution was developed using the mean and standard deviation by week of gestation. Our primary outcomes were stillbirth, neonatal death, or adverse composite neonatal outcome (neonatal demise, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, neonatal seizures, or assisted ventilation for > 6 hours). RESULTS: 2.4 million singleton non-anomalous deliveries occurred in this cohort with 2,334 stillbirths, 2033 neonatal deaths, and 180,168 adverse neonatal outcomes. Smoking increased odds for low birth weight [table 1]. Stillbirth rates were stratified by maternal smoking status. There was no significant increase in the risk for stillbirth (OR 0.9, 0.8-1.0 95% CI, p=0.06, [figure] ). The attributable fraction for was higher for prematurity than for maternal smoking status for both stillbirth and neonatal demise [ In order to optimize management of neonates with gastroschisis we evaluated the risk of culture proven sepsis based upon the mode of delivery. Additionally, we investigated the effect of sepsis and mode of delivery on length of stay (LOS). METHODS: Records of neonates with gastroschisis and their mothers at two academic medical centers from February 1999 to December 2012 were reviewed. The mode of delivery was defined as: vaginally (V), cesarean section with labor (CS&L), and cesarean section (CS) without labor. Sepsis rates by mode of delivery were assessed. Log-binomial risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported after adjustment for the presence of chlamydia, genital herpes and urinary tract infections (UTI); the effects of sepsis and mode of delivery on LOS were assessed using multiple linear regression. Figure( s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: A significant increase in risk of sepsis was observed for neonates with gastroschisis delivered by CS&L however their LOS was shorter compared to V; also, neonates delivered to mothers with chlamydia, genital herpes or UTI showed a significantly greater risk of sepsis.",

METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of an MFMU multicenter observational study of delivery after prior uterine scar. Women with singleton gestations and one prior cesarean, either PC or PL, were included. Those with other uterine scars were excluded. We compared adverse maternal outcomes between our two exposure groups (PC and PL) in a subsequent pregnancy. Multivariable log-binomial regression was used to estimate the risk of adverse maternal outcome associated with one prior classical cesarean. RESULTS: Of 28,112 women included, 27,310 (97.1%) had PL and 802 (2.9%) had PC. Women with PC were more likely to be African American, unmarried, smokers, carry government insurance, and have medical comorbidities. There were also significant differences in delivery type for the index pregnancy.

Unadjusted analyses showed significantly higher risk of intraoperative transfusion, endometritis, postoperative ileus, and the composite maternal outcome in those with PC. Marked variability exists in data addressing prevalence and significance of PT-GA in OBGYN literature with ethnicity rarely addressed. Our goal was to identify prevalence to guide management and resourceful testing in the era of personalized medicine for patients in hypercoagulable. METHODS: Pubmed, EMBASE, Medline and Cochrane library were interrogated for PT-GA and prevalence. Inclusion criteria were manuscripts defining the population, subject numbers, health status, and allele frequency. Carrier rate results were organized by continent and racio-ethnicity. RESULTS: 398 articles were identified and reviewed; 43 met inclusion criteria with a total 25, 689 subjects tested for PT GA. West and South African populations including Ethiopian Jews showed 0% prevalence. North African populations that were studied displayed rates between 0.7 in Egypt and 2.9% in Algeria and Morocco, likely due to admixtures in the population. In Asia, while Japan, Thailand, Singapore, China, and India have 0%, the Middle East displays varied rates of 0-6.7%. Middle Eastern Jews had rates of 1-4%, Sephardic Jews 5.5%, and Ashkenazi Jew 6.7%. There is a higher prevalence in Southern Europe (overall carrier rate 3%) than in Northern Europe (carrier rate 1.7%). Significantly higher rates were detected in Italy, France, Cyprus, Albania and Croatia of 4%. In Oceania, rates varied from 1.3-4.6%, but 0% in aboriginals. In North America, Mexicans, American Indians and African Americans showed 0% while the carrier rate was 2.5% among Caucasians in US. In South America, rates range from 0-1.6%; gene prevalence appeared in a select population considered caucasoid, though once again African Americans, Asians, and Amer-Indians displayed 0%.",

However, little data exists about more common neonatal outcomes, particularly at term. We analyzed the risk of neonatal respiratory morbidity at term, among infants of women with a prior cesarean, by intended and actual mode of delivery (MOD). METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network study of women with a prior cesarean. Women with nonanomalous, singleton gestations delivered at \u00b337 weeks were analyzed by intended mode of delivery: planned vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) vs planned repeat cesarean. A second analysis was performed by actual MOD: successful VBAC, failed VBAC, or planned repeat cesarean. The primary outcome was composite respiratory morbidity including respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN). Multivariable log-Binomial regression was used to adjust for confounders. RESULTS: 44,055 women met inclusion criteria. 64.8% (n=28,546) delivered by planned repeat cesarean, while 35.2% (n=15,509) planned a VBAC. Of women who attempted VBAC, 26.6% (n=4,119) were unsuccessful and had an unplanned repeat cesarean. Overall, when analyzed by intended mode of delivery, respiratory morbidity was increased in infants delivered by planned repeat cesarean (RR 2.1, 95% CI 1.8, 2.5) (Figure) . When analyzed by actual mode of delivery, respiratory morbidity was lowest in infants delivered vaginally at 39 weeks (Table) .",

INTRODUCTION: As obesity has been linked with the potential to impair the immune response, we sought to determine if there is an association between maternal body mass index (BMI) and maternal and neonatal pertussis antibody concentrations after administration of the Tdap vaccine in pregnancy. METHODS: This is a nested cohort study of 123 women who received the Tdap vaccine during pregnancy.

However, the influence of rupture of membrane (ROM) duration on maternal morbidity is poorly understood. We hypothesized that the ratio of ROM: labor duration predicts maternal morbidity among VBAC cases. METHODS: Using MFMU Cesarean registry, our cohort comprised women with singleton, term pregnancies (\u00b337 wks) who had a successful VBAC. Maternal morbidity was defined by at least one of the following: sepsis, chorioamnionitis, postpartum endometritis, intensive care admission, postpartum transfusion, uterine rupture or death. Ratio between ROM duration to labor duration was categorized into quartiles (<0.24;0.24-0.29;0.50-0.94;\u00b30.95). Significant variables (P<0.1) were included in stepwise logistic regression model. RESULTS: Among 9,392 women with successful VBAC, 515 (5.5%) experienced maternal morbidity. Women with ratios in the upper quartiles were at increased risk of morbidity. Variables independently related to maternal morbidity were African American, Asian or Hispanic race/ethnicity; public insurance; BMI\u00b325 and regional anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Among women having a VBAC, a ratio of ROM duration to labor duration of \u00b30.5 was associated with the highest odds for maternal adverse outcome. Prospective studies are needed to assess the value of this ratio in predicting maternal morbidity in women attempting VBAC. A massive transfusion protocol (MTP) is a structured system for delivery of blood products.

There was no difference in mean number of pRBC units between groups. In contrast, more women received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) post-implementation (60.5% vs 37.3%, p=0.001). Similarly, post-implementation patients were more likely to receive platelets (36.8% vs 21.7%, p=0.02). AKI was significantly more likely in the pre-implementation group (15.7% vs. 3.5%, p=0.003).

Height may be protective against cesarean delivery, even in the setting of obesity. This study aims to quantify the protective effect of maternal height against CD. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a multicenter trial of fetal pulse oximetry among 5,341 nulliparous women in spontaneous and induced labor of singleton gestations \u00b336 weeks gestation. Congenital anomalies, and missing values in height, pre-pregnancy weight or delivery weight were excluded. CD rates were calculated by pre-pregnancy BMI (<20, 20-24.9, 25-29.9, 30-34.9, \u00b335) stratified by height in inches (<64, 64-68, >68). For comparisons, BMI 20-24.9 and height 64-68 in. were used as reference. Multivariable regression modeling was used to control for confounders. Similar analyses were also performed using BMI at delivery. RESULTS: Complete data were available for analysis in 5,131 women. The overall rate of CD was 26.8%. Decreasing rates of CD occurred with increasing height at BMI <20, 20-24.9 and 25-29.9 (Table; p=0.02, p<0.0001, p=0.03 respectively). In multivariate analysis, when compared to the reference group the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) decreased with increasing height for BMI 25-29.9, BMI 30-34.9 and BMI \u00b335 women; the aORs were significant for short and average height women at these BMIs (Table) . Similar results were observed for BMI at delivery (Table) . When height and BMI were assessed as continuous variables, the estimated aORs (not shown) approximated well to those shown. *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing maternal height was associated with a decreasing risk of CD at all BMIs. The increasing rates of CD among obese women are attenuated by increasing height, with a lower aOR in tall, obese women than in short, average weight women. These results may be useful in the antenatal counseling of obese women and may also be useful in the development of a prospective labor prediction model.",

The types of PVL were as follows: cystic (n=50), volume loss (n=9), combined (n=1), and unknown (n=2). The prevalence of PVL before 35 weeks in the population was 52/2,187 (2.4%). There were 40 cases (65%) concentrated between 27 and 32 weeks. Associated risk factors were premature rupture of membrane (n=14), bag formation (n=9), chorioamnionitis (n=7), previous vertical cesarean section (n=4), maternal hemorrhage (n=2), diabetes mellitus or gestational diabetes mellitus (n=2), and hypothyroidism (n=2). Fetal factors were nonreassuring fetal status (n=14), monochorionic twins (n=10), and intrauterine growth restriction (n=4). Post-intraventricular hemorrhage was seen at 22-30 weeks, infection at 24-33 weeks, monochorionic twins at 24-35 weeks, and congenital anomalies at only 38-39 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of PVL was 2.4% in preterm infants born at 22-34 weeks, which is consistent with previous reports. Infection and cardiac dysfunction are possible causes of PVL in some preterm infants. Oligohydramnios is an indication for delivery at term based on the premise it represents fetal compromise.

The cesarean rate (34/173 vs. 110/519, p=0.75) and cesarean rate for nonreassuring fetal status (8/173 vs 21/519, p=0.82) were not significantly different. The prevalence of NICU admission was unchanged (11/173 vs 33/519, p>0.9). There were no differences in five minute APGAR scores < seven (4/173 vs 8/519, p=0.51) or meconium stained fluid (18/173 vs 41/519, p=0.34). ",

INTRODUCTION: Previous work suggests that 80% of women who receive antenatal corticosteroids (ACS) deliver at >7 days from administration of ACS. This practice of non-ideal administration potentially diminishes the benefit to the neonate. Therefore, we chose to assess both the proportion of women who received steroids and delivered at >7 days, and the potential effect of this practice on the neonate. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study at a single institution between 2006 and 2011. The study included singleton non-anomalous pregnancies between 24 and 34 weeks gestation which received a course of ACS, remained pregnant for \u00b324 hours following the first ACS dose, and delivered at <35 weeks gestation. An ideally timed course was defined as delivery \u22647 days from the first ACS dose. A non-ideal course was defined as delivery more than 7 days following the first dose. The primary outcome was neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), confirmed by chest x-ray or chart review when the x-ray was not available. Secondary outcomes included ventilator support, surfactant use, and neonatal demise (NND). Associations between ACS timing and neonatal outcomes were examined through logistic regression models before and after adjustment for confounders. RESULTS: A total of 456 women were included, of whom 51.8% (n=236) had ideal ACS. Among the 220 (48.2%) women that received non-ideal ACS, 29.5% (n=65) received rescue steroids. Mean GA was 30.3 weeks (\u00b1 3.2 weeks) for ideal ACS and 31.0 weeks (\u00b13.0 weeks) for non-ideal ACS. As shown in the table, the group with ideal timing had a significantly lower risk of RDS (73.6% vs 81.7%). The risk of ventilator support, surfactant use or death was similar between groups. *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort over 50% of patient had ideally timed steroids. Ideal timing of the first course of ACS was associated with a reduction in RDS. These findings suggest that the timing of the first course of ACS remains important, even in the setting of rescue steroids. ",

The impact of transfusion on wound healing warrants further investigation to establish evidence based guidelines for transfusion in the postpartum patient. Prior studies have shown that for cesarean (CD) labeled \"emergent,\" decision-to-incision time <30min does not improve neonatal acidemia. However, the effect of skin incision to delivery (surgical speed, SS) on umbilical artery (UA) pH has not been previously evaluated, particularly as it relates to primary versus repeat cesareans.

In the current analysis, women undergoing emergent CD for cord prolapse were dichotomized into those with a skin incision to fetal delivery time \u00a32min (I-D\u00a32) and >2min (I-D>2) based on the mode (2 min).

The median SS was 3min for this cohort. This may indicate appropriate triage of a \"true\" emergency and suggest that a goal of 3min between skin incision and delivery is appropriate in the setting of cord prolapse. After adjusting for confounders including chorioamnionitis and preeclampsia, transfusion remained associated with pulmonary edema and ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: Transfusion was associated with an increased risk for complications including pulmonary edema, endometritis, wound complications, pulmonary embolism, and ICU admission.

METHODS: A survey was given to patients presenting to the obstetric triage unit in a large academic urban hospital. Patients were asked if they had received a Pertussis (Tdap) immunization. If a patient had not received an immunization, she was given a list of multiple reasons for why she had not received an immunization. The answers included 1) a failure to be advised by physician 2) an inability to pay for the immunization 3) a belief that vaccines are harmful to the fetus 4) a belief that vaccines are not beneficial and 5) other. The rate of immunization in this population was determined and reasons for not receiving the immunization were recorded. RESULTS: Sixty-eight out of 277 patients (24.%) had received the recommend immunization. One hundred and fifty two out of 209 (72.7%) of those who did not receive the vaccine, the most common reason indicated was that they were never told about it. The second most common reason was concerns about safety of receiving the vaccine while pregnant (6.7%, 14/209).

Thus, we sought to describe common ANO following UR, comparing them to women with failed trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) without UR. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a multicenter observational study of cesarean delivery (CD). Included were women with nonanomalous singleton gestations and 1 prior low transverse CD who attempted TOLAC. The primary outcome was a neonatal composite including death, respiratory complications, hypoglycemia, sepsis, 5-min Apgar<3, need for resuscitation, encephalopathy (HIE), pH<7, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, and length of stay (LOS). The primary outcome and most common ANO were compared in neonates after failed TOLAC with UR to those without UR. Chi-squared, Fisher's exact test, Student's t-test and Wilcoxon rank sum were used in bivariate comparisons where appropriate. A log-linear regression model was fit to adjust for confounders. RESULTS: Of 3575 included women, UR occurred in 84 cases (0.02%). After UR, 54% (n=45) had a pH<7, 39% (n=33) were admitted to the NICU, and 17% (n=14) had a prolonged LOS or required ventilator support. Seizures, abnormal neurologic diagnoses or HIE occurred in 5% (n=6). There was 1 neonatal death. Neonates in the UR group were more likely to have seizures, HIE, and a 5-min Apgar<3 [Table] . The rate of the primary outcome was similar in both groups (UR 67% v. no UR 57%, p=0.06). After adjusting for confounders, no clinically significant difference was found (RR 1.16, 95%CI 0.99, 1.35). However, when analyzed individually, there were significant increases in ANO in the UR group. Although increased rates of death were not statistically significant, the relative risk of death occurring after UR was greatly increased [Table] . CONCLUSIONS: Adverse outcomes such as HIE and seizures are more common after UR. These data, along with the data regarding common ANO associated with rupture, fill a void in the counseling of patients desiring TOLAC.

We obtained the obstetrical electronic records of over 8000 term singleton neonates delivered in 2013. We calculated the lowest quartile for the umbilical artery ph(pHA) and compared with demographic, medical, obstetrical and intrapartum factors. We used Chi-square, student T test and regression analysis as indicated. RESULTS: There were 5448 valid pHA results with a mean+SD of 7.27+0.064 and the lowest quartile was 7.24. Factors significantly associated with the lowest quartile pHA included higher maternal BMI, tobacco smoke, induction agents, pre-gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, Labetalol use, Magnesuim sulfate use, PROM, shoulder dystocia, longer 2nd stage of labor and abnormal fetal heart rate patterns; whilst cesarean and cefalozin administration were protective. Regression analysis confirmed smoking(p=0.001,), magnesium sulfate use(p=0.005), cesarean section(p=0.001), abnormal fetal heart rate(p=0.000), and second stage of labor(p=0.000) as independent predictors. Small-for-gestational-age (SGA) neonates are at risk for adverse perinatal outcomes. When delivery is indicated, it remains unclear whether cesarean delivery improves neonatal outcomes. Even less is known regarding outcomes for SGA neonates that experience trial of labor after cesarean delivery (TOLAC). We hypothesized that women who attempt TOLAC and deliver SGA neonates have comparable neonatal outcomes to those who undergo repeat cesarean without labor.",

CONCLUSIONS: Women who undergo TOLAC and deliver SGA neonates have similar neonatal outcomes to those who deliver by repeat cesarean without trial of labor. We conclude that TOLAC is an acceptable option for women with a history of prior cesarean and SGA neonates. The effects of smoking status on adverse perinatal outcomes is well-known. However, to what extent smoking cessation early in pregnancy is related to risk reduction of major smoking-related complications is less clear. Aim: To assess associations between self-reported smoking status in pregnancy and major perinatal outcomes. METHODS: Setting: Single-centre study of women who delivered at University Hospital Southampton, United Kingdom. Comparisons: Women who reported, at booking, to have never smoked, stopped >1 year prior to conceiving, stopped <1 year prior to conceiving, stopped when pregnancy was confirmed, continued smoking up to 10 cigarettes/day, continued smoking up to 10-20 cigarettes/day, and continued smoking over 20 cigarettes/day. Outcomes measures: Percentage of preterm birth <37 weeks gestational age, small-for-gestational age (SGA) <p10, SGA <p5 and stillbirths. Mean differences in birth weight, birth weight centile, head circumference, placental weight, placental-to-fetal weight ratio, with adjustments for fetal gender, maternal height, parity by logistic regression models. RESULTS: 39,715 (53.3%) of women were never smokers, 14,946 (20.1%) stopped smoking prior to pregnancy, 6,455 (8.7%) stopped smoking when pregnancy was confirmed, and 13,333 (17.9%) continued smoking 10 cigarettes/day or more. We observed no difference between non-smokers and women who quit when pregnancy was confirmed for preterm birth (6.6% vs 6.2%, P=0.25), SGA (9.5% vs 10.0%; P=0.15) and stillbirth (0.5% vs 0.3%; P=0.14) In contrast, when compared with non-smokers, of those women who continued to smoke during pregnancy, a significantly greater proportion experienced preterm birth (9.8%, p<0.001), SGA (19.7%; P<0.001), and stillbirth (0.6%; P=0.010).

We characterised nephron number and cardio-renal phenotype of F3 offspring born to normally grown and growth restricted (F1) mothers or fathers. METHODS: Late gestation rat uteroplacental insufficiency was induced (Restricted) or sham (Control) surgery. To generate F3 paternal line offspring, F1 Control and Restricted males were mated with normal females and F2 Control and Restricted males were then mated with normal females. F3 maternal line offspring were similarly generated. F3 body weights were measured (birth to 12 months). Nephron number was quantified using unbiased stereology at day 35. Renal excretions, creatinine clearance (both 24h) and blood pressure were measured at 6 (maternal and paternal lines) and 12 (maternal line only) months. Data were analysed by t-test within a gender and line. RESULTS: Although F1 offspring were born small, F2 and F3 offspring (maternal and paternal lines) had normal birth weights. F3 growth trajectories (birth to 12 months) were not different between groups and lines. F3 male and female nephron endowment and blood pressure was not different between groups for paternal and maternal lines. F3 maternal line renal function was normal at 6 months. However, at 12 months, renal dysfunction emerged in males (proteinuria) and females (increased urinary creatinine), despite normal creatinine clearance (eGFR). The paternal line F3 offspring had evidence of impaired eGFR (reduced creatinine clearance) at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: F3 offspring, born to F1 growth restricted mothers or fathers are not programmed to be of low birth weight but developed renal dysfunction in the absence of obesity. The proteinuria that emerged with aging in F3 maternal line males was in the absence of nephron deficits, hypertension and reduced eGFR, suggesting tubulointerstitial injury. In contrast, F3 paternal line offspring had glomerular dysfunction (reduced eGFR), indicative of glomerular filtration deficits. Our findings provide novel evidence of transgenerational transmission of renal dysfunction to F3 offspring from both maternal and paternal lines.",

Further, an increase in imprinted disorders has been documented in IVF children. However, it is unknown if epigenetic changes are limited to imprinted loci or are a widespread phenomenon, affecting other non-imprinted loci. Previously we observed downregulation of Glut3 mRNA levels in placentae of IVF fetuses, and here we investigated if DNA methylation differences were present at this locus in placenta of IVF or naturally conceived mice fetuses. METHODS: Blastocysts (CF1 x B6D2F1/J) generated by IVF and cultured in KSOM with amino acids, or produced by natural mating and flushed from uterus (FB group) were transferred to pseudopregnant recipients. At E18.5 placentae were removed for assessment of Glut3 mRNA and protein levels.

            "text": "Use Livestock farming uses genetic selection of animal characteristics related to efficient production of meat, dairy and wool. However, the phenotypic signatures are not merely related to information hidden in DNA structure, but reflect many other life events. The metabolome is the set of small molecules (<2000 Da) synthesised through biochemical reactions within the living organism. As a downstream product of genetic predisposition and environmental factors, metabolomics may allow more accurate determination of the future growth and development of individual animals. Aim: to identify plasma metabolic signatures which discriminate between lambs that grow well and those that grow poorly. Accurate prediction of lambs that will grow faster to slaughter would enable better use of feed resources, enhance farm efficiency and thus provide commercial benefit to the producer. METHODS: Ram EDTA plasma samples from two separate flocks were collected at docking (n 1 =79, d 1 =22 days; n 2 =77, d 2 =19 days) and weaning (n 1 =63, d 1 =98 days; n 2 =60, d 2 =88 days). Metabolite profiling was conducted using gas chromatography-MS. Chromatographic data was divided into discovery and validation steps, separated according to the flock. In each group, the metabolome of low weight lambs (below 20 th centile of slaughter weight) were compared to the remaining animals. RESULTS: 87 metabolites were identified in plasma samples. Two organic acids and one amino acid, were found in both discovery and validation steps to significantly differ (p<0.05) between low and high slaughter weight animals in the samples collected at weaning. There were no common metabolites, between flock 1 and 2, able to predict lamb growth to slaughter (p>0.05) at the docking stage. CONCLUSIONS: Poor lamb growth was reflected in their plasma metabolome in blood collected at weaning. Causal relationship between the identified metabolites and growth will be further investigated. The current study suggests that the use of biomarkers could improve sheep farming profitability by identification of slow-growing animals at an early stage. Smoking is associated with changes in the composition of the maternal microbiome and there is now considerable evidence to suggest that the establishment of the infant microbiome may play an important role in the development of obesity. Therefore we hypothesized that fetal and neonatal exposure to nicotine, the major addictive component of cigarette smoke, would result in gut microbial community differences in postnatal life. METHODS: Female rats were randomized to receive daily injections of saline (N=20) or nicotine (1.0 mg/kg/d; N=20) from 2 weeks prior to mating until weaning. To examine the effect of nicotine exposure on the composition of the gut microbiome, fecal samples were collected at 3 (weaning), 12 and 26 weeks. Pair-end sequencing was done on the V3 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene on an Illumina MiSeq. Data was processed through a bioinformatics pipeline (Farncombe Genomics Facility, McMaster University) and was analyzed by QIIME to determine changes in the community composition and the diversity of the gut microbiome in nicotine-exposed and control offspring. RESULTS: At the phyla level, fetal and neonatal exposure to nicotine resulted in alterations in the proportion of both Firmicutes and Bacteriodetes at 26 weeks of age. There were significant changes in a number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at all time points; these differences were observed in both male and female nicotine-exposed offspring. A number of OTUs belonging to the Lachnospiraceae family were increased in the nicotine-exposed offspring, suggesting increased energy extraction in these animals.However, there were no changes in beta diversity between treated and control offspring suggesting that nicotine-induced differences in the gut microbiota represents proportional alterations rather than an effect on the overall species richness in the gut. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal nicotine exposure resulted in differences in the microbial communities within the gut of the offspring; an effect that persisted into adulthood. Since changes in gut microbiota have been associated with increased weight gain and adiposity, these data suggest that alterations in the gut microbiome as a result of maternal nicotine exposure may explain, in part, the increased risk of obesity in children born to mothers who smoke.",

Pediatric Neonatology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA. INTRODUCTION: Fetal intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) often occurs in the context of a maternal high saturated fat diet (HFD). The combination of IUGR and a HFD (IUGR+HFD) persistently increases cholesterol levels in humans and rodent models. One pathway regulating cholesterol levels involves hepatic conversion of cholesterol to bile acids for elimination from the body. The rate-limiting step in the formation of bile acids is the enzyme Cyp7a1. Cy7a1 is inhibited by microRNA-122 (miR-122). Compared to non-IUGR HFD rats, we previously demonstrated that IUGR+HFD increases hepatic cholesterol, decreases hepatic Cyp7a1 protein, and increases miR-122 in juvenile female, but not male, rats. However, the importance of increased miR-122 in IUGR+HFD induced decreased cholesterol elimination from the body remains unknown. We hypothesized that in vivo inhibition of miR-122 in female juvenile IUGR+HFD rats would decrease hepatic cholesterol and miR-122 and increase hepatic Cyp7a1 protein abundance. METHODS: Adult female rats were fed a HFD prior to mating through gestation and weaning. IUGR was induced by uterine artery ligation at E19 of a 21 day gestation. At postnatal day 21 (D21) IUGR+HFD female rats were injected with either a miR-122 inhibitor or saline control and fed a HFD for an additional 5 days. At D26, we measured hepatic cholesterol with a colorimetric kit, Cyp7a1 protein abundance with western blot, and miR-122 with real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Compared to saline injected IUGR+HFD rats, miR-122 inhibitor injected IUGR+HFD rats had decreased miR-122 (p<0.05), increased Cyp7a1 protein (p<0.05), and non-significantly decreased hepatic cholesterol (p=0.1).",

We speculate that miR-122 is a causal link between IUGR+HFD and decreased cholesterol conversion to bile acids for elimination from the body. Implications of this study include potential utility of miR-122 inhibitors for improving cholesterol elimination from the body. Our next step is to determine the impact of miR-122 inhibition on long-term cholesterol physiology and potential toxicity. We previously identified differential gene expression in fetuses of obese compared to lean pregnant women in the second trimester, including significant upregulation of the gene Apolipoprotein D (APOD). APOD is specific to the central nervous system; its expression is increased in the setting of oxidative stress. We sought to investigate these findings in a mouse model of maternal diet-induced obesity. METHODS: Female C57BL/6J mice were fed either a 60% fat high-fat diet (HFD), or a 10% fat control diet (CD). Embryos were retrieved on embryonic day 17.5 and weights and crown-rump lengths (CRLs) were recorded. RNA was extracted from 10 male and 10 female embryonic brains per diet group. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed for brain apod, using gapdh and hprt as endogenous controls. Differences in apod expression were estimated with the \u2206\u2206CT method. Mann Whitney testing was used to determine significant differences between groups; p\u00a30.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Embryos of obese dams weighed significantly less than those of CD dams, with males more affected than females (males 0.82 vs. 1.08 \u00b10.05 g, p=0.003; females 0.85 vs. 0.93 \u00b1 0.06 grams, p=0.38). The CRL was significantly reduced in embryos of obese dams, males were again more affected than females (males 19.42 vs 21.76 \u00b1 0.43 mm, p=0.003; females 19.5 vs 20.48 \u00b1 0.53 mm, p=0.31). Apod expression was slightly increased in male embryos and decreased in female embryos of obese compared to control dams (p=0.09, Fig 1) . Within the HFD group, apod expression was significantly higher in male compared to female embryos (p=0.05). *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal obesity is associated with significantly smaller male embryo size. Brain gene expression of apod is higher in male compared to female embryos of obese dams. This may reflect sexspecific differences in oxidative stress in the embryonic brain. Future evaluation of the effects of maternal obesity on fetal neurodevelopment should consider fetal sex.",

METHODS: DNA of 88 MRKH patients, parents, and controls was studied using whole exome sequencing (WES). Since previous studies have shown repetitive deletions in chromosome 16p11.2 and 17q12 in multiple MRKH patients, these regions were given top priority along with variants seen in two or more affected individuals that had frameshift, nonsense, or splice site variants. Variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: A total of 45 variants were seen in at least two MRKH patients including five nonsense, 17 splice site, and 23 frameshift. These variants are currently being confirmed by Sanger sequencing. A heterozygous frameshift variant (4bp deletion) in ZNHIT3 on 17q12 was identified and confirmed in one MRKH female and her mother who had bradycardia, valvular heart disease, scoliosis, and rib abnormalities. ZNHIT3 has been reported to interact with retinoid receptors, defects of which may impair Mullerian development in mice. All protein coding exons and splice sites of ZNHIT3 are being sequenced in additional MRKH patients. CONCLUSIONS: If additional variants in this gene are identified, this will provide strong evidence for involvement of ZNHIT3 in mullerian development. Our findings indicate that next generation DNA sequencing may provide new clues for genes involved in the molecular basis of Mullerian development. Parental separation is known to increase the risk of ill-health in children and could also have long term health impact. Previous research has indicated associations between experiences of parental separation during childhood and inflammation in adulthood as well as elevated risk of pregnancy hypertension. This study explored childhood experience of parental separation and serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6 at preterm and term delivery in relation to current stress. METHODS: Blood samples were collected during labor from 23 women with preterm delivery and 36 women with term delivery with no pre-eclampsia or other systemic disease and IL-6 was quantified using Bio-Plex. Women filled out a questionnaire, including questions on family situation during childhood and if parents lived together or divorced/never lived together. Participants were also asked to rate their current experience of stress, using a visual analogue scale (VAS). A linear regression model was conducted with the variables Preterm/Term delivery, Family situation (intact family/separated parents) and current stress. RESULTS: Experiences of parental separation did not differ between preterm and term groups of women. In the preterm group five women reported having separated parents, whereas 14 women in the term group reported having separated parents. The mean stress did not differ between preterm and term women. The linear regression model showed a significant association between family situation and labor IL-6 (\u03b2=.31, p=.017). Preterm delivery was negatively associated with IL-6 (\u03b2=.-25 p=.046). Current stress was not associated with labor IL-6. *Figure(s) will be available online.",

These findings may have implications for vascular function of infants exposed to a diabetic intrauterine environment. INTRODUCTION: Transient UCO causes cerebral asphyxia and reoxygenation, which might influence fetal development and lead to clinical disorders later in life. UCO triggers the fetal hemodynamic response characterized by an increase in blood pressure (BP) and a decrease in heart rate (HR). This will allow a redistribution of the combined ventricular output (CVO) for survival. However, this response is temporary and fetal death can occur if the stimulus continues. We have previously reported that ketamine, a noncompetitive N-Methyl-Daspartate receptor antagonist, can modify the fetal hemodynamic response to ventilatory hypoxia and cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. We propose that treatment with ketamine will enhance the fetal hemodynamic response when exposed to UCO. METHODS: Fetal sheep were chronically catheterized at gestational day 125 (n=5-11/group), and an extravascular occluder was placed around the umbilical cord. Ketamine (3mg/kg) was administered intravenously to the fetus 10 min prior to the insult. UCO was induced by infusing saline into the occluder to limit the umbilical vein blood flow until fetal P a O 2 levels were reduced by 50%. Maternal and fetal blood gases, fetal HR, and BP were recorded throughout the experiments. Data was analyzed as a three-way ANOVA (factors: stimulus and treatment) with time as repeated measurements. RESULTS: UCO produced an initial increase on fetal BP in both control and ketamine groups (P=0.018 time), followed by a decrease in the control group whereas values remained higher with ketamine. HR values decreased after UCO (P=0.041 stimulus*time) in both groups, but the reduction was higher at the beginning of the experiment in control compared to ketamine groups. Fetal P a CO 2 levels increased after UCO (P<0.01 stimulus*time) but values were higher in the control versus ketamine groups. UCO significantly decreased fetal pH values (P<0.01 stimulus*time) with a greater effect on the control versus ketamine group. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine improved the hemodynamic fetal response and partially reduced the levels of P a CO 2 after UCO. Higher fetal BP and HR values, compared to the control group, suggests a rise in the CVO leading to an increase in fetal blood flow, better oxygenation, and a higher pH. Ketamine might play an important role in reducing fetal mortality and morbidity during UCO episodes in human pregnancy.",

METHODS: E2 mice were randomly assigned into 3 groups: a baseline diet group fed a 2.27% fat diet, a control group fed a 10.2% fat diet or a docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) enriched group fed on the 10.2% fat diet supplemented with 1.5% DHA as measured in relation to the total fat content of the diet. The same diets were fed to the pups after birth. Subsequently on the expected day of delivery (E18), pups were delivered either by vaginally (na\u00efve group) or by caesarean section. This was further divided into a normoxic caesarean section (CS) group or with 15 min of hypoxic ischaemia caesarean section (HI group).

CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that DHA transferred into the pup brain from the maternal diet. However, DHA supplementation did not improve the outcome of pups which suffered HIE.

METHODS: Genome-wide DNA methylation was profiled using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina; San Diego, CA) in 192 term infant placental samples collected as part of the Rhode Island Child Health Study (RICHS) cohort. All SNP associated, crosshybridizing, or sex associated probes were eliminated yielding ~351,000 sites for analysis. We compared samples from IUGR (n= 17) versus normal pregnancies (n= 175) following a reference-free correction to account for different cell proportions and inclusion of infant gender, maternal age, and gestational age as potential confounding variables. In addition, differentially methylation regions (DMRs) were identified using the R package DMRcate. Array results were validated by pyrosequencing, and qRT-PCR was used to determine correlations between gene methylation and expression. RESULTS: DMR identification yielded several regions with variable methylation levels between infants from IUGR and normal pregnancies. Among these was an approximately 2000bp window within the CRHR2 gene which acts as a responsive element to the master regulator of the HPA axis, corticotropin-releasing hormone. Differences in methylation were also determined at the single base pair resolution which yielded significantly different (FDR < 0.05) methylation levels at a CpG site within the 5'UTR of KRAS, an important regulatory element in cellular propagation and growth. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we have identified candidate sites that due to altered methylation levels, may be playing a role in fetal growth restriction. The identified targets include genes not previously associated with a clinical risk of IUGR. Adequate placental delivery of long chain fatty acids (LCPUFA) is essential for normal fetal development and is regulated by placental uptake and metabolism. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key nutrient sensor in the cell and its phosphorylation is associated with fatty acid uptake in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Effect of AMPK stimulation on placental fatty acid uptake has not been reported. We hypothesize that AMPK activation in vitro will increase LCPUFA uptake and fatty acid transporters in human placental explants. METHODS: Explants were isolated from term placental tissue of lean (N=10) and obese (N=8) women with informed consent following caesarean delivery. Explants were incubated for 24hr with the AMPK activators resveratrol (100\u00b5M) and AICAR (1mM) and their respective vehicles. Following treatment, the uptake of 14 C-labeled palmitate (PA) oleate (OA), arachidonic acid (AA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA) was measured. Expression of the placental fatty acid transporter genes CD36, FABPpm and FATP4 was assessed by QPCR. P value <0.05 vs vehicle control by t-test was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Both resveratrol and AICAR treatment stimulated phosphorylation of AMPK\u03b1 (catalytic subunit) in the explants. Resveratrol decreased AA and DHA uptake by ~50% (P<0.0001) compared to control while PA and OA uptake was unaffected (N=18). AICAR inhibited the uptake of PA (by 13%, P=0.04), OA (22%, P=0.001) and DHA (30%, P=0.0005) (N=13). Placental CD36 mRNA expression was increased following resveratrol (P=0.01) and AICAR (P=0.001) treatment, while the expression of FABPpm was not significantly altered. AICAR (P=0.001), but not resveratrol (P=0.10), increased FATP4 mRNA. Neither maternal obesity nor fetal sex altered these findings. Preliminary results show that resveratrol decreased the oxidation of 3 H-PA by ~50% in placental explants (N=3). CONCLUSIONS: Activation of AMPK led to a decrease in fatty acid uptake in term placental explants, contrary to our hypothesis. This lower uptake was associated with higher expression of the fatty acid transporters, CD36 and FATP4, suggesting that decreases in placental fatty acid transporter expression are not responsible for the decrease in LCPUFA uptake. Suppression of fatty acid oxidation, instead, may drive lower rates of uptake.",

We examined the effect of maternal Mg deficiency on placental nutrient transporter expression and nutrient uptake by placenta cells. METHODS: SW dams were fed diets with 100%Mg(control) or 10%Mg(MgD) from gestational day 6(GD6) until euthanasia(GD18) to produce moderate Mg deficiency. Expression of placental nutrient transporters was assessed by qRT-PCR. The effect of various Mg concentrations (25%-100%) on placental nutrient uptake was determined using 3 H-glucose and 14 C-MEAIB with BeWo placental cells. In vivo data were analyzed using Student's t-tests; in vitro data were analyzed by ANOVA/Bonferroni. RESULTS: MgD altered placental expression of genes associated with nutrient transport. MgD significantly decreased Slc7a5 gene expression (Table, p<0 .05), reduced Slc38a2, Slc38a4 and Glut-1 expression (not significantly) and increased Slc38a1 and Slc27a4 expression (not significantly). Amino acid and glucose uptake by BeWo placental cells were significantly impaired by Mg deficiency (Fig, p<0 .05). The formation of oxysterols, the products of cholesterol oxidation, is promoted by oxidative stress and hypoxia, common insults germane to FGR. Indeed, levels of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) particles are increased in the maternal, fetal and placental compartments of pregnancies affected by FGR. We have previously shown that in primary human tropholbasts (PHTs), the oxysterol 25-hydroxy cholesterol (25OHC) inhibits the transcription factor SREBP2, resulting in reduced expression of LDLR and HMGCR, key mediators of cholesterol uptake and synthesis, respectively.

This was improved further by combination of UTAD with PMA(NPV 99.8%); LR-were 0.37 & 0.14 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In an at risk population a normal UTAD and PMA effectively exclude severe early onset FGR. After normal assessment at 22-24 weeks, the risk of preterm FGR is very low (risk<1:500) and there is little benefit in serial ultrasound assessments. FGR requiring late pre-term delivery cannot be adequately excluded and repeat ultrasound examination at 35-36 weeks is required. A combination of PMA with UTAD is an effective way of reducing the number of 3rd trimester scans; we propose an algorithm for ultrasound assessment of high risk women that reduces scan frequency without compromising FGR detection.

INTRODUCTION: Fibrosis is common in developmental programming (DP) of offspring (OFF) organs by poor maternal nutrition. OFF of obese mice on a high energy diet show increased liver TGF\u03b2 and collagen formation [1], OFF of rats fed a low protein diet show increased TGF-\u03b2 glomerular expression, collagen and fibronectin. TGF\u03b2 inhibits fetal, but stimulates adult, human skin fibroblast proliferation. [2]. TGF-\u03b2 and its receptors are widely expressed in multiple organs. We evaluated TGF-\u03b2 changes in fetal liver and kidney in IUGR in the nonhuman primate. METHODS: Morphometrically homogeneous adult female baboons were randomly selected for ad lib feed (CTR; n = 20) or 70% CTR global diet (IUGR, n = 18) from 0.16 -0.9 G. Liver and kidney were stained for TGFb1 (sc-146 Santa Cruz) and quantified by image analysis (ImageJ, NIH) for fraction stained (area immunostained \u00f7 area of field x 100%) and density. Analysis Student's t-test; data M \u00b1 SEM, *p< 0.05. RESULTS: TGFb1 protein was higher in fetal liver and kidney cortex and medulla in IUGR vs. CTR with male values > female at all locations( Fig 1)These findings would predispose the liver and kidney to fibrosis and would have a greater effect in males than females. *Figure(s) will be available online.Fig 1.

Unlike other immune cells their numbers do not appear to fluctuate in response to estrogen and progesterone but they are reported to be activated immediately before and during menstruation. Recently MCs have emerged as key players in physiological and pathological pain pathways and may also participate in juxtacrine signalling in neuro-immune synapses. Studies using MC cell lines and non-reproductive tissues have reported that MCs express both estrogen (ERa, ERb) and progesterone (PR) receptors and that activation of MCs can be induced by estrogen. The aim of this study was to investigate the phenotype of tissue resident human uterine MCs and to use MCs differentiated from primary peripheral blood precursors as well as uterine tissue sections to investigate expression of steroid receptors (SRs). METHODS: Full thickness uterine biopsies were collected from 6 women (normal menstrual bleeding, no fibroids or endometriosis). Peripheral blood samples were collected from healthy female donors; CD34+ cells were differentiated into mature MCs using an 8 week protocol. Concentrations of mRNAs encoded by steroid receptors (SRs: androgen AR, PR, ERa, ERb, glucocorticoid GR) were measured by qRT PCR. Immunohistochemical colocalization of MCs and receptors was performed. RESULTS: In the human uterus MCs were most abundant in myometrium; both the morphology and numbers of MC were stage-dependent. Double immunofluorescence revealed that tissue resident mature uterine MCs were immunonegative for ERa, PR and AR but that a proportion was immunopositive for ERb or GR. Preliminary data using in vitro matured MCs indicated a dynamic expression of SRs as phenotype may change as MCs differentiate from precursors. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that human uterine MCs are immunonegative for ERa and PR a finding that is in contrast to reports based on immature cell lines. These data are consistent with the expression of SRs being influenced by the local tissue microenvironment where MCs reside.These data highlight a potential role for steroid hormones in the function of MC recruitment/maturation, merit further work to determine how the interplay between MCs and steroids and their local microenvironment contribute to the pathophysiology of painful gynaecological complaints. Overall, no DNA copy number alterations were found in eutopic and ectopic of women with and without endometriosis, except in 6 samples from 4 patients with small DNA changes. One patient with OA had several copy neutral losses of heterozygosity across the genome in both EB and OA. One patient from the control group had a small deletion at the tip of Chr17q25.3 in her EB sample. One patient with PEL had a segmental copy-number gain on chromosome 19p12 (logR) in both EB and PEL. Another patient with PEL showed a mosaic copy-neutral event of the X chromosome in the PEL but not in the EB sample. The mosaic sample was composed of ~10% aberrant cells with uniparental disomy (UPD) and ~90% normal cells.CONCLUSIONS:In this study, we were unable to confirm our hypothesis that SNP profiles are different in EB from women with and without endometriosis, and that SNP profiles are different in PEL or OA when compared to EB.

All of 9 serous ovarian cancers have been propagated from one to four passages. Serous ovarian cancer was subsequently retransplanted into the intrabursa of the mouse ovary, which resulted in ascites and metastasizes to many organs in the abdominal cavity including the omentum, cecum, mesentery, pancreas, liver, kidney, diaphragm, and spleen. Cryopreserved PDX tumors also re-grew in the mice. The morphological features between all methods of transplantation were similar, and the histology of the xenografted tumor resembled the original cancer. Cisplatin resistant tumors as well as tumors carrying fluorescent and luciferase reporters were also established as models to study efficacy of targeted agents. Four aggressive endometrial cancer PDX tumor lines, successfully generated through subrenal xenografting, are available in the core for testing of targeted compounds to study their effects on tumor growth and metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: The PDX tumor model was successfully established in NSG female mice, which recaptures patterns of human ovarian and endometrial cancer growth and metastasis.

We have previously shown in a pilot study that the endocannabinoid system (ECS) is differentially expressed in EC. Our aim here was to investigate further this expression of the ECS and then examine the potential of the endocannabinoid, anandamide (AEA), as a biomarker for endometrial cancer. METHODS: Blood and endometrial tissue were collected from volunteers undergoing treatment for EC. Plasma and tissue AEA levels were quantified using UHPLC-MS/MS. Plasma AEA levels were higher in EC compared to controls and were directly correlated with tissue levels. This increase in tissue AEA concentrations could be explained by the increased NAPE-PLD and decreased FAAH expression. The positive correlation between plasma and tissue AEA levels makes a strong case for investigating this endocannabinoid as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of EC. Ishikawa cell numbers were determined with colour development at 450nm and significance determined using two-way ANOVA in Prism. RESULTS: AEA,OEA,PEA and capsaicin(CAP) caused reduction in cell number, but only at highest dose(1\u00b5M). AEA induced maximal reduction(71.9%) in cell numbers at 18 hours, whilst OEA reduced cell numbers by 89.1% at 18 hours, PEA was quicker and reduced cell numbers by 90.5% at 4 hours and CAP was most effective(maximal effect 95%) at 18 hours. Each compound had variable effects on Ishikawa cell number at different time points with AEA's maximal effect at 18 hours, being negated at 48 and 72 hours post XTT addition. Similarly, Ishikawa cells treated with OEA and capsaicin recovered at 24 hours, while PEA treated cells recovered at 18 hours.",

Senny Wong, 1 Katie Speirs, 2 Suzann Duan, 2 Iain LO Buxton. 2 1 Biochemistry, University of Nevada, Reno, NV, USA; 2 Pharmacology, University of Nevada, Reno, NV, USA. INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer contributes to the most diagnosed cancer in women. Majority of breast cancer related deaths are due to metastasis, illustrating the significance of understanding the process of metastasis. We propose that nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) is mechanistically associated metastasis. NDPK released from breast cancer cells has been shown to promote endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and tumor-mediated angiogenesis. It is also shown released from human breast, colon, pancreas and lung tumors. However, the process of NDPK release in not known. Exosomes are small 30-100nm vesicles that form from inward budding in multivesicular bodies. The fusion of multivesicular bodies to the cell membrane facilitates the secretion of exosomes to the extracellular matrix. Secreted exosomes play a role in targeting cells for cell-to-cell communication, this is especially important in cancer signaling to distant regions of the body. Using directed proteomics, we show that NDPK is a protein cargo found in exosomes secreted by breast cancer cells.identification, exosomes were lysated and ran on the LTQ-Orbitrap XL for mass spectrometry analysis. All experiments were performed in triplicate. RESULTS: Exosomes purified from MDA-MB-231 and MCF-12F cells were detected by TEM. In addition, CD63 (a tetraspanin protein associated with membranes of intracellular vesicles), Alix (an adaptor protein involved in concentrating and sorting of cargo proteins into exosomes), and NDPK-A protein were detected through immunofluorescence. The presence of NDPK and identify peptides unique to NDPK isoforms A and B was established using MS/MS. Most patients with MOC present with stage I or II disease. Patients with MOC have overall good outcomes after upfront cytoreductive surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by cytoreductive surgery to no gross residual disease. Both C/T and FOLFOX are effective regimens for MOC and have the potential to be the cornerstone of combination regimens with molecular targeting agents. We searched a prospectively maintained database for all patients with FIGO 1988 stage III and IV endometrial cancer diagnosed between 1999-2012. All patients underwent comprehensive surgical staging either upfront or following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Medical records were scrutinized for demographics, surgical stage, pathologic data and treatment received.RESULTS:We identified 100 patients with advanced uterine cancer. 89 patients had stage III disease and 11 patients had stage IV disease. 69% had a type I uterine cancer and 31% a type II uterine cancer. 65% patients had pure endometrioid histology and 14% had uterine serous carcinoma. Less frequent histologies included carcinosarcoma and clear for node negative stage III patients who received chemotherapy with either vaginal brachytherapy or pelvic radiation or both (P <0.05). There were no isolated vaginal failures noted in this group of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with stage III endometrial cancer and node negative disease have improved outcomes when managed with chemotherapy and vaginal brachytherapy or a combination of chemotherapy and pelvic radiation. Cumulative incidences over time were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to compare the incidences of cancers in the two cohorts. RESULTS: A total of 8833 women with incident uterine fibroids and 9533 controls were included. Over a median follow-up of 5.in the first year. Similarly, for all cancers studied, uterine fibroids were associated with a doubling of risk in the first year after being recorded in THIN versus controls and an increased risk overall, which was reduced after adjustment by healthcare service use in the first year. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of breast and gynecological cancers was increased in women with uterine fibroids compared with controls.

OBGYN & Reproductive Sciences, University of California, San Francicso, CA, USA. INTRODUCTION: Human endometrial epithelium is the primary barrier against pathogens in the upper female reproductive tract and interacts with the embryo during implantation. Endometrial epithelial cell (eEC) cultures provide a valuable in vitro tool for functional studies but have multiple limitations including tissue sample size/eEC yields, in vitro growth potential, and culture longevity, hindering widespread use as an experimental model. Developing a cryopreservation protocol for tissuederived eEC can alleviate current limitations. The objective of this study was to optimize conditions for cryopreservation and recovery of eEC. METHODS: Endometrial biopsies (N=5) were obtained from premenopausal women undergoing gynecological procedures. Samples were digested, separated by size fractionation, and enriched by selective attachment. All freezing media used 10% DMSO as a cryoprotectant. Variables tested included two medium formulations and various FBS concentrations: 75% DMEM/25% MCDB105 with 10% FBS (SCM); KSFM with 1%, 2%, or 10% FBS. Cells were cooled in styrofoam at -80\u00b0C for 24h then transferred to liquid nitrogen. Cells were thawed at 37\u00b0C, washed in KSFM, and seeded in Matrigel plates. Stromal cell (eSF) contamination was assessed by phase contrast microscopy. One week post-plating, a WST reagent was added for 30min to cultures to assess viability. Measurement of eEC-specific markers by immunofluorescence (IF) and qPCR in recovered eEC were also conducted.Relaxin-Deficiency Results in Increased Angiogenic Gene Expression in the Uterus of Early PregnantMice.

Obstetrics  and Gynecology, REI Division, Columbia University, NY, NY, USA.   INTRODUCTION: It is currently suggested that endometrial manipulation (EM) may aid implantation and improve reproductive outcomes in recurrent implantation failure (RIF) patients. Inflammatory changes in growth and transcription factors, cytokines, and adhesive molecule expression may explain the enhanced receptivity and implantation. Embryo quality and endometrial preparation are frequent confounders in previous studies. To control for these confounders, the objective of this study was to determine if reproductive outcomes were influenced by the timing of EM with respect to embryo transfer (ET) in recipients undergoing donor oocyte in-vitro fertilization (DIVF). There was no difference in the schedule timing of EM with respect to ET in recipients of DIVF for implantation and clinical pregnancy rates in our study. Designing a study that included a donor population controlled for embryo quality and endometrial preparation confounders. Although EM may benefit reproductive outcomes in selective populations for IVF-ET such as RIF, it needs further validation in future research. Human embryo implantation is a multistep process requiring both receptive endometrium and good quality embryo at the blastocyst stage. The uterine cavity provides the microenvironment into which a blastocyst arrives; it is essential that the fluid within the uterine cavity provides a hospitable environment for implantation to occur. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is primarily known as a ligand regulating cholesterol cellular uptake by binding to low density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R). In recent years studies have suggested a link between obesity and infertility. However the presence of ApoE, other apolipoproteins and cholesterol, within the endometrium and endometrial fluid, and their relationship to female fertility have not been investigated. METHODS: Uterine lavage samples were collected from a cohort of fertile and infertile women across all phases of the menstrual cycle.

This suggests that different mechanisms may be involved for BPA exposure to increase the risk of PTB and pPROM.RESULTS:INF2 expression in wildtype mouse placentas increased until E15.5 and then declined until birth. In wildtype placentas, high levels of INF2 were expressed in the junctional and labyrinth zones, specifically in trophoblast giant cells and spongiotrophoblasts. No INF2 was detectable in knockout mouse placentas. Birth timing was significantly delayed in the knockout compared to wildtype mice (19.7 vs 19.2 days of gestation, Thus, we examined CBS, CSE, and CDO expression in mouse pregnancy and at labor. METHODS: Uterus was collected from timed-pregnant nulliparous C57/ BL6 mice. To characterize gestational expression, tissue was harvested from gestational day 15-19, and at labor. Preterm labor (day 15) was induced with the P 4 -receptor antagonist, RU486 (0.5 mg). Term labor (day 19) was prevented with P 4 (1 mg; day 17, 18). In both instances, tissue from treated mice or age-matched controls was collected at delivery of first pup. CBS, CSE, and CDO in uterus were evaluated by western blot, and quantified by infrared fluorescence imaging using the ratio of enzyme to \u03b2-actin. Results were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance followed by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. RESULTS: CBS was unchanged throughout pregnancy or with hormonal manipulation in preterm or term labor. CSE did not change as gestation Increased CSE and decreased CDO in term mouse uterus indicate that L-Cys may be shunted to H 2 S production in labor.",

As such, hormonal changes may be better predictors of goiter responsiveness CONCLUSIONS: AF hormone levels have not been used to titrate fetal therapeutic dosing. In utero T4 injections effect both biochemical and structural changes in fetal goiters. Maternal dosage requirements have not predicted fetal doses used. Sequential AF hormone values may be useful to better titrate dosages required to properly treat iatrogenically created fetal goiters. Given the structural and hormonal responses observed at the 200\u00b5g dose, we suggest 200\u00b5g be the initial treatment dose. With increasing GA and goiter size, the dose can be doubled to 400\u00b5g at 2 to 4 weeks intervals as clinical circumstances dictate.Chromosomal Microarray Analysis Uptake in Women UndergoingInvasive Prenatal Testing: A Single Institution Experience. Mariam Naqvi, Kaitlin Hanmer, Ilona Goldfarb, Allison Bryant. Vincent Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. INTRODUCTION:While ACOG and SMFM recommend chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) for women undergoing invasive prenatal diagnosis for fetal structural abnormalities, some advocate offering CMA to all women undergoing invasive testing. We began offering CMA to all women undergoing invasive testing in 2013 and studied CMA uptake among these women over a nine month period.METHODS:We identified all women who underwent chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis for any indication between September 2013 and June 2014 at our institution. Our primary objective was to compare CMA uptake for the indication of fetal structural anomaly with CMA uptake for all other indications. Our secondary objective was to identify demographic differences among those women documented to have been offered CMA and those who were not, and differences among women who underwent CMA and those who did not. Univariable and multivariable regression were used to adjust for potential confounders. RESULTS: 103 women underwent CVS (n=37) or amniocentesis (n=66) over the nine month period. 91% were documented to have been offered CMA by a genetic counselor and 40% had CMA performed. Women who were found to have a fetal structural abnormality were more likely to undergo CMA than women who underwent invasive testing for all other indications in both univariable and multivariable analysis (aOR 3.84, 95% CI 1.2-12.4).",

INTRODUCTION: Indomethacin use in pregnancy generates conflicting views.Our study examines safety of antenatal indomethacin when it is extended beyond 48-72h, in women with cervical shortening. METHODS: Cohort study of fetuses treated under our LIT protocol: Women with progressive cervical shortening <25mm before 24w. Oral indomethacin: 100mg loading, 50mg qid upto 48h, 25mg qid. Monitored weekly for oligohydramnios and ductus arteriosus (DA) constriction. LIT was stopped automatically at 32w, earlier for complications. Pulmonary hemorrhage, patent DA, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) Grade III-IV, other intracranial hemorrhage (IH), thrombocytopenia (platelet <150K), anemia (Hb<13 g/dl), acute kidney injury (AKI:creatinine>1.5mg/ dl and urine output <1ml/h) at delivery and 4-5 days of life were noted. Outcome was compared to babies with similar presentation who received no indomethacin. RESULTS: LIT was used in 197 cases. There were 89 controls. LIT began at mean 22.2w; median duration was 52 (4-108)d. 1 fetus (0.5%) had DA constriction-LIT was stopped, no treatment needed. Four (2.3%) had oligohydramnios at 25-26w (6-15d after LIT started), delivering at 27.2-37.1w, after LIT was stopped. Controls' weight and gestetational age (GA) at birth didnot differ from LIT cases. Individual complications didnot differ vs controls.Total IVH+IH was not significantly different. Complications were numerically more in the LIT group, but even the composite of ALL complications was not significantly different (p>0.05). By logistic regression, only GA contributed meaningfully to complications (p< 0.0001) CONCLUSIONS: LIT, for 7-8 weeks on average, didnot increase fetal or neonatal problems when used in this protocol. The safety demonstrated here is permissive to an RCT of indomethacin in prevention of preterm birth.Importance of Fetal Fraction Analysis for cfDNA Testing in theGeneral Pregnancy Population.

INTRODUCTION: The Harmony TM Prenatal Test uses an assay method, Digital Analysis of Selected Regions (DANSR TM), for analysis of chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X and Y as well as other chromosomes to measure fetal fraction. Products from the DANSR assay are then analyzed with the Fetal fraction Optimized Risk of Trisomy Evaluation (FORTE TM ) algorithm to assess patient-specific risk of trisomy. Alternative tests, such as those using massively parallel shotgun sequencing, use a Z-statistic or Normalized Chromosome Value (NCV) to discriminate between normal and abnormal chromosomal counts without accounting for fetal fraction. METHODS: A general pregnancy population cohort of 15,841 women between 10.0 to 14.3 weeks gestation were followed to pregnancy outcome. Z-statistics were computed using previously described standard Z-test of proportions and compared to FORTE risk scores generated by the Harmony test. A Z-statistic of \u2265 3 was considered 'Positive' for trisomy and a FORTE risk score of \u2265 1% was 'High Risk' for trisomy.RESULTS:The cohort included 38 cases of trisomy 21 (T21) and 10 cases of trisomy 18 (T18). A subset of participants (n = 11,185) had trisomy 13 (T13) analysis.",

INTRODUCTION:Fetal monocytes are present in fetal and placental circulations and have the opportunity to play significant roles including: homeostasis, immune defense, and tissue repair. There is little available data on fetal monocyte phenotype and function. They may play a role in pathogenesis of pregnancy complications including preeclampsia (PE) and intrauterine fetal growth restriction (IUGR). In this pilot study we aimed to describe the cord blood monocyte subset phenotype in normal pregnancy and in pregnancy complications such as PE and IUGR. METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional case control study was conducted. Cord blood samples from 26 pregnancies were collected at delivery from normal pregnancy, PE, IUGR and PE with IUGR. The distribution of fetal monocyte subtypes was characterized by CD14 and CD16 expression using flow cytometry and compared for each clinical group using a classification of classical, intermediate and non-classical subtypes. RESULTS: There is a trend towards an increase in the intermediate and non-classical monocyte subsets in the cord blood of PE, IUGR and PE+IUGR as compared to the normal pregnancies which reached statistical significance for the non-classical subset. The intermediate monocytes were the dominant monocyte subtype in the cord blood of PE, IUGR and PE+IUGR as opposed to a predominance of classical subtypes in normal pregnancy and adults. *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: We have documented for the first time in cord blood of PE and IUGR, a distinctive monocyte subset distribution with the intermediate subset dominating. Fetal monocytes may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of PE and IUGR and further study is warranted into their phenotype and function.Expression of Inflammatory Markers in Women WithSymptoms of Perinatal Depression.

Hind N Moussa, Mateo G Leon, Ana Marti, Claudia Pedroza, Sean C Blackwell, Baha M Sibai. Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, The University of Texas Medical School, Houston, TX, USA. INTRODUCTION: The ACOG task force (TF) on hypertension (HTN) in pregnancy introduced a new definition of superimposed preeclampsia (SIP) adding severe features (SF) as new criteria.The TF recommended that those with SIP be delivered \u00b337 wks, whereas those with SF be delivered \u00a334 wks. Our aim was to investigate the validity of this new definition by comparing pregnancy adverse outcomes in SIP with and without SF. METHODS: Women with chronic HTN and singleton pregnancies enrolled in a multicenter trial were studied. SIP was reclassified according to the new definition to SIP and SIP-SF (persistent systolic BP > 160 or diastolic BP >110, plts < 100K, LFTs >70, Cr > 1.1, or persistent CNS/ abdominal symptoms). Composite adverse outcomes including rates of total and indicated preterm birth, abruptio, postpartum hemorrhage, and maternal and perinatal death were compared by X2. Adjustment was done with a multivariate logistic-regression analysis and all statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: 763 patients met inclusion criteria, and 216 (27%) had SIP. 129 (17%) had a diagnosis of SIP and 87 (11%) had SIP-SF. Baseline characteristics including maternal age, baseline BP, and assignment to low dose aspirin were similar between both groups. Using univariate analysis, the composite adverse outcome was higher among the SIP-SF group (p=0.04), as well as indicated preterm birth (p=0.02), cesarean section (p=0.02), and SGA (p=0.02). After adjustment, composite adverse outcomes were similar in both groups, however, SGA was higher among SIP-SF (aOR3.12, p=0.02).",

Mott Center for Human Growth and Development, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA. INTRODUCTION:Computer-delivered brief interventions (CBIs) are a promising option for addressing alcohol use in antenatal care settings; they provide consistent screening and evidence-based brief interventions at low cost without requiring substantial time and effort from medical staff. Prior analyses of the effects of an empathic, interactive, and tailored singlesession CBI on maternal alcohol use showed 90-day period prevalence abstinence rates of 90% for the CBI group, vs. 74% for controls (OR = 3.4, p = 0.19). The current secondary analysis focuses on pregnancy outcomes, with a positive outcome defined as a live birth > 2500g without NICU admission. METHODS: Phase I parallel groups randomized trial. Forty-eight T-ACE positive pregnant women were recruited from a Henry Ford Hospital prenatal clinic in Detroit, and randomly assigned to a single, 20-minute CBI plus three tailored mailings (n = 24) or to an attention control condition (n = 24). Participants were primarily low income and African-American (n = 39, 81%), with mean gestational age of 12 weeks at baseline/randomization. RESULTS: Blinded review of participants' electronic medical records revealed positive pregnancy outcomes in 19 of 23 CBI participants for whom data were available (82.6%), vs. 14 of 23 control group participants (60.9%; p = 0.09). Examination of subcomponents revealed no differences in miscarriage(2 ineach group [8.7%]). Fewer CBI infants had an NICU admission (1 [4.5%] vs. 3 [13.6%]) or low birthweight (0 vs. 4 [20%]). CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings suggest that CBIs for alcohol use in pregnancy may result in better pregnancy outcomes. Development of a Non-Obese Mouse Dietary Model of Gestational Diabetes. Kathleen A Pennington, Kelly E Pollock, Jennifer A Kaiser, Laura C Schulz. Obstetrics, Gynecology and Women's Health, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA. INTRODUCTION: Gestational diabetes mellitus(GDM)is defined as diabetes that begins during pregnancy, and it usually resolves after parturition. It has both immediate and long term impacts on metabolic and cardiovascular health of the mother and fetus. GDM is one of the most common obstetrical complications, affecting 7-18% of all pregnancies. Despite its high prevalence, there is no widely accepted animal model. Previous studies in rodents have shown that a high fat diet (HFD) for 1 month before pregnancy induces obesity and type II diabetes. Other laboratories have used the heterozygous leptin receptor mutant (Lepr db/+ ) as a model of GDM, but our laboratory and others were unable to replicate this. We therefore set out to develop a mouse model of GDM. METHODS: Wild type (Wt) C57B6/J and Lepr db/+ mice were placed on either a control (CD) or 45% fat diet (HFD) from either one or three weeks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy. At d17.5 glucose tolerance tests were performed, and serum was collected for leptin and insulin measurement. RESULTS: Regardless of genotype, mice placed on a HFD one week prior to mating developed GDM [Area under the curve 12500 + 721(Wt CD) vs. 23900 + 2900 (Wt 1WkHFD), 1360 + 435 (Lepr db/+ CD) vs. 2300 + 933 (Lepr db/+ 1WkHFD)] (2-way ANOVA, diet p<0.001). Weights differed by genotype (P<0.0001), but not diet: Wt CD (31.26\u00b10.93g) vs. WT HFD (31.13\u00b10.78g) and Lepr db/+ CD (36.53\u00b10.80g) vs. Lepr db/+ HFD (38.22\u00b10.80g). Glucose tolerance was not significantly impaired in mice placed on a HFD 3 weeks prior to mating (AUC WT 3WkHD 15600 + 1430 vs. Lepr db/+ 3WkHFD 17500 + 2500), suggesting adaptation to the HFD over time. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we have developed a novel model of GDM with no obesity and no diabetes prior to pregnancy. Future studies will use this model to characterize the effects of GDM on offspring and maternal health. Indigenous Australian women are twice as likely to develop pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia, preterm birth and IUGR.",

INTRODUCTION: Most people have a reduction in their nighttime blood pressure (BP) of >10%, these individuals are known as 'dippers'.In the pregnant population loss of the nocturnal dip has been associated with pre-eclampsia (PE). 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is routinely used in the non-pregnant population as a confirmative diagnostic tool. It provides valuable additional information over standard BP measurement including circadian variation in BP. Despite these advantages there is no current defined role for 24-hour ABPM in pregnancy. The aim of this study was to compare the 24-hour BP profiles of women at high risk of developing PE. METHODS: Nineteen women <20 weeks gestation attending the Manchester Antenatal Vascular Services (MAViS) research clinic who required antihypertensive medication, or had a standard BP close to target or treatment threshold underwent 24-hour ABPM. ABPM was recorded half hourly during the day and hourly at night with a SpaceLabs 92017a-1. Wake, sleep and drug ingestion times were self-reported. RESULTS: Of the 19 women examined 15 had essential hypertension, 9 had uncomplicated pregnancy outcomes, 9 developed PE and 1 pregnancy was complicated by fetal growth restriction (FGR).",

INTRODUCTION: Intrauterine hypoxia is one of most challenging conditions during pregnancy and fetal development. Placental hypoxia can alter extravillous trophoblast (EVT) invasion, disrupt normal spiral artery remodeling, reduce perfusion, and contribute to fetal growth restriction. Since the pregnant guinea pig (GP) placenta closely mimics human placental morphology and EVT invasion, we propose to develop a pregnant GP model to study the underlying mechanisms associated with the placental response to in utero hypoxia. METHODS: Pregnant GPs were maintained in either normoxia (NMX; N=10) or placed in a hypoxic chamber of differing O 2 levels (HPX; 16%, N=4; 12%, N=5; 10.5%O 2 , N=10) at 30d gestation (after implantation and before EVT invasion) until term. At 64d gestation (term=65d), pregnant GPs were anesthetized, mean brachial artery blood pressures (MAP) measured, placentas and fetuses excised, and fetal organs (heart, brain, liver, kidney) weighed. Placentas were fixed for histology and Placental Growth Factor (PGF) mRNA levels measured by qPCR. RESULTS: At near term(64 d), maternal MAP (mmHg; mean\u00b1SE) of NMX GPs was 40.4\u00b12.4. MAPs were increased (P<0.001) with HPX at 10.5% O 2 (57.9\u00b12.4) but not at 16% (45.8\u00b12.4) or 12%O 2 (44.2\u00b12.1) compared to NMX controls. Fetal body weight (FBW, g) progressively decreased with HPX severity (85.5\u00b12.0 vs 85.5\u00b13.7 vs 78.6\u00b13.8 vs 71.7\u00b11.9; NMX vs 16% vs 12% vs 10.5%O 2 ; respectively, P<0.05 vs 10.5% only). Asymmetric growth restriction was indicated by a HPXinduced increase (P<0.05) in fetal heart/FBW ratios by 13% (at 12% and 10.5%O 2 ) and brain/FBW ratios by 11.2% (at 10.5%O 2 ) and no change in relative liver or kidney weight. HPX at 10.5%O 2 increased (P<0.05) placenta wt by 10.1%, relative placenta wt by 31.8%, PGF mRNA levels by 2.2 fold (0.005\u00b10.001 vs 0.011\u00b10.002 expression ratio; NMX vs HPX), and exhibited compaction of the placental labyrinth compared to NMX. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic intrauterine hypoxia stimulates placenta growth as a compensatory response to the reduced oxygenation although may negatively impact spiral artery remodeling. The placental growth is insufficient to prevent growth restriction of the fetus and may contribute to maternal hypertension. We conclude that intrauterine hypoxia generates placental insufficiency in the pregnant GP, making it a useful model for investigating altered EVT invasion.

Ancizar Betancourt, Madhu Chauhan, Yuanlin Dong, Meena Balakrishnan, Mathew Anderson, Michael Belfort, Chandra Yallampalli. OB/GYN, Baylor College of Medicine/Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, USA. INTRODUCTION: Calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) and its family members adrenomedullin (AM) and intermedin (IMD) play important roles in maintaining vascular adaptation during pregnancy, but their effect on human omental arteries (OA), are unknown. The aim of this study was to determine if vasodilatory responses of OA to CGRP family peptides and the expression of their receptor components in OA are elevated during pregnancy.METHODS:Omental arteries, were collected from non-pregnant(NP) women (n=8) during laporatomy and term pregnant (P) women (n=9) at caesarian section. The OA were cleaned, cut into rings and mounted on a wire myograph. Rings were pre-contracted with U46619 (1\u00b5M), and relaxation responses to CGRP AM and IMD (0.1nM -100nM), and bradykinin (BK, 0.1nM -1\u00b5M), as percent inhibition of U46619 induced contraction were assessed.

Elizabeth Cottrell, 1 Ainslie Garrod, 1 Sarah Finn-Sell, 1 Mark Wareing, 1 Elizabeth Cowley, 1 Susan Greenwood, 1 Philip N Baker, 2 Colin Sibley. 1 1 Maternal and Fetal Health Research Centre, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom; 2 Liggins Institute, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand. INTRODUCTION:Epidemiological studies show that consumption of a diet high in fruits and vegetables during pregnancy is beneficial. However, the specific factors underlying these associations are not well understood. Diets high in vegetables provide both anti-oxidants and significant amounts of inorganic nitrate. Dietary nitrate is an important modulator of cardiovascular function in non-pregnant humans and animals, providing an exogenous source of nitric oxide (NO) that can improve blood flow and reduce damage caused by ischemia-reperfusion injury. In FGR pregnancies, reduced NO production and/or bioavailability is reported.Here we tested the hypothesis that maternal nitrate supplementation during pregnancy would increase NO bioavailability and action, and improve vascular function and fetal growth in a mouse model of FGR, the endothelial nitric oxide synthase knockout (eNOS -/-) mouse. METHODS: Pregnant C57Bl/6J (wildtype) and eNOS -/mice were supplemented with nitrate-containing beetroot juice (BR+) in the drinking water from embryonic day (E)12.5, to deliver ~1mmol/kg/day inorganic nitrate. Control mice received an isocaloric dose of apple juice (AJ) or an equivalent dose of nitrate-depleted beetroot juice (BR-). At E18.5, fetal and placental weights were measured and maternal uterine arteries (UtA) isolated. UtA contraction (phenylephrine [PE]; 0.1-10000nM) and endothelium-dependent relaxation (acetylcholine [Ach]; 0.1-10000nM) were assessed by wire myography. RESULTS: Supplementation of pregnant eNOS -/mice with BR+ improved maternal UtA vascular function. UtA of BR+ mice exhibited reduced contraction to PE (p<0.05) and increased relaxation to Ach (p<0.01) compared with those from AJ control mice. Contraction and relaxation responses of UtA from BR-mice were not different from AJ controls, indicating the nitrate-dependence of BR+ effects. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary nitrate supplementation improves uteroplacental vascular function in a mouse model of FGR. Ongoing studies aim to determine the mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects.Mechanisms Underlying CGRP Family Peptides-InducedVasorelaxation of Human Omental Arteries During Pregnancy.

Statistical analyses were performed using paired, across group techniques with p<.05 accepted for significance. RESULTS: HELLP and PRE were not significantly different with respect to age, BMI, interval since last delivery or cycle day studied (p=.27-.96). Prior affected pregnancies were delivered at similar gestational ages with similar incidences of IUGR (50% per group). In HELLP we observed a decrease in cerebral blood flow in the thalamus over the course of subsequent pregnancies (-27.96\u00b125.5 mL/100g tissue/min, p=.025), with all other lobes showing trends toward decreased cerebral blood flow (temporal -13.77\u00b111.5, p=.06; frontal -9.4\u00b111.9, p=0.12; occipital -18.95\u00b114.2, p=.14; parietal -12.5\u00b111.3, p=.11). In contrast, cerebral blood flow in PRE remained relatively unchanged over pregnancy in all regions interrogated (temporal -0.68\u00b110.1; frontal 0.39\u00b17.2; occipital -4.37\u00b117.1; parietal -1.56\u00b110.3). Among all subjects, there was a positive correlation between frontal lobe blood flow changes and percent plasma volume expansion as a function of lean body mass (r=.593, p=.038). CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral perfusion studies demonstrate significant posterior circulation changes, evident by thalamic blood flow variation, between women with a history of HELLP and PRE. Changes in plasma volume over pregnancy appear to be associated with changes in cerebral blood flow, specifically in the frontal lobe. These unique hemodynamic features identified in pregnancy in women with a history of HELLP compared with prior PRE, if present in other vascular beds, may help explain unique clinical features associated with HELLP syndrome.Elucidation of the Role of the DDAH/ADMA/NO Axis in Pregnancy-Related Haemodynamic Adaptation.

INTRODUCTION:Obesity is associated with cardiovascular complications including preeclampsia, hypertension, and CVD. We sought to determine the association of obesity and fat distribution (determined by DEXA) on hemodynamic variables linked to an increased risk for preeclampsia when observed prior to pregnancy. METHODS: We evaluated 79 healthy nulliparous woman, aged 30\u00b14 years. Obesity was indexed as both BMI and body composition (both total percent body fat, (%BF) and central android % fat (%ABF) determined by DEXA). Spearman correlation coefficients were used to assess relationships between BMI, %BF, and %ABF with blood pressure (BP), pulse (P), pulse wave velocity (PWV), cardiac output (CO), and uterine blood flow (UBF). T-tests were used to compare morbidly obese subjects (MO > 40% body fat) with normal-weight subjects (NW <30% body fat). P< .05 was accepted for significance. RESULTS: BMI was moderately correlated with DEXA derived indices of fat (%BF r=.78 p<.001, %ABF r=.74 p<0.001). %ABF and %BF were strongly associated (r=.95, p<.001) BMI was associated with increased P (r=.31, p<.01), diastolic BP (r=.22, p<.05) andCO (r=.31, p=.005). %ABF was associated with increased P (r=.40, p<.001), PWV (r=.31, p<.01) and CO (r=.25, p<.05) %BF and %ABF had similar associations.

INTRODUCTION:Uterine artery hemodynamic abnormalities in early pregnancy are associated with fetal growth restriction and preeclampsia. The factors that influence early pregnancy uterine artery blood flow (UBF) and resistance index (RI) are not well understood. METHODS: We evaluated 40 healthy, nulliparous young women (age 30\u00b14 years, BMI 24\u00b16 kg/m 2) ) both prepregnancy (PP) and again at 12-14 weeks of pregnancy (EP). Subjects were evaluated PP in the follicular phase (cycle day 9\u00b13), subsequently conceived singletons, and were re-evaluated in EP at mean gestational age (GA) 91\u00b15 days. Evaluations followed overnight fasts. Volumetric UBF and RI were measured bilaterally using transvaginal Doppler ultrasound. DEXA scans were used to evaluate body composition. Additional PP physiologic variables included pulse wave velocity (PWV), plasma volume corrected for lean body mass (PV/LBM) and measures of obesity. Prior early pregnancy loss was ascertained from clinical histories. Stepwise regression models examined EP UBF and RI, and the change in UBF and RI from PP to EP as dependent variables. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD with p<0.10 accepted for significance for model contributors. RESULTS: Increased EP UBF was associated with prior early pregnancy loss (R 2 =0.15, p=.02), higher PP PV/LBM (R 2 =0.13, p=.02), and higher GA at observation (R 2 =0.08, p=.06). Surprisingly, PP UBF was not a significant contributor to EP UBF. The same factors contributed similarly to changes in UBF from PP to EP. RI in EP was highest in women with >40% body fat (R 2 =0.09, p=.07), and change in RI was associated with PP RI (R 2 =0.36, p<.0001) and fat mass (R 2 =0.07, p=.05) CONCLUSIONS: Increased EP UBF is observed in women who have experienced prior early pregnancy loss, despite no observable difference in PP UBF. Increased EP UBF is also associated with increased PP PV/ LBM. Uterine artery RI is higher in obese women this association with obesity is observed both PP and EP. Lower RI in EP is inversely associated with PP RI and obesity. For women in their first ongoing pregnancy, prior pregnancy, regardless of length, appears to result in enhanced uterine artery vascular remodeling. Additionally obesity appears to contribute to early uterine hemodynamic adaptations and may contribute to adverse pregnancy outcome.Prepregnancy Blood Pressure and History of First Trimester LossContribute To Birth Weight and Placental Weight. Erin A Morris, 1 Carole A McBride, 1 Gary J Badger, 2 Ira M Bernstein. 1 1 Obstetrics, Gynecology & Reproductive Sciences, UVM College of Medicine, Burlington, VT, USA; 2 Medical Biostatistics, UVM, Burlington, VT, USA. INTRODUCTION: Evidence suggests maternal cardiovascular fitness is an important component of successful pregnancy outcome.Our aim was to determine the association of prepregnancy cardiovascular physiology on outcomes of birthweight (BW) and placental weight. METHODS: 34 healthy nulliparous women were enrolled in a longitudinal study prior to planned pregnancy. A detailed cardiovascular assessment was performed during the follicular phase. Blood pressure was measured in the seated position with continuous non-invasive tonometric radial artery monitoring. Cardiac output (CO), uterine blood flow (UBF), plasma volume (PV) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were also examined. Univariate and stepwise multivariate regressions were used to determine associations of cardiovascular variables with BW and placental weight. Data are expressed as mean\u00b1sd, with significance at p<.05. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 30\u00b14 years, with mean BMI of 24.3\u00b15.7. 11 women had histories of prior first trimester loss. Mean gestational age (GA) at delivery was 278\u00b110 days with mean BW of 3476\u00b1506g and mean placental weight of 482\u00b189g. Significant independent contributors to BW included: GA at delivery (r 2 0.34, p=.0003), infant sex (r 2 0.16, p=.004), maternal height (r 2 .09, p=.015), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (r 2 .06, p=.034) and history of first trimester pregnancy loss (r 2 .05, p=.036). Male infants had higher BW than female infants (3673\u00b1470g, 3159\u00b1399g, p=.002). This regression model accounted for 70% of variation in BW. Prior first trimester pregnancy loss and DBP were also significant independent contributors to placental weight (r 2 .141, .174, p=.041, .014), contributing to 32% of variation in placental weight. DBP had a negative correlation with both BW and placental weight such that lower prepregnancy DBP was associated with higher BW and placental weight. Prepregnancy CO, UBF, PV and PWV were not found to be independent contributors to BW or placental weight. CONCLUSIONS: Prepregnancy DBP and prior first trimester pregnancy loss are significant independent contributors to BW and placental weight. These findings may highlight the importance of low systemic vascular resistance for optimal placentation and fetal growth. Our findings suggest that a previous pregnancy, even if it ends in the first trimester, may have a lasting favorable effect on the uterine environment.Persistence of Pregnancy-Induced Maternal Uterine VascularRemodeling in Rodents. Erin A Morris, George Osol. Obstetrics, Gynecology & Reproductive Sciences, UVM College of Medicine, Burlington, VT, USA. INTRODUCTION:There is growing evidence that maternal cardiovascular adaptation to pregnancy has long-lasting consequences for cardiovascular health, with a paucity of information on postpartum changes. We aimed to evaluate patterns of pregnancy-induced uterine vascular changes postpartum in a rat model.METHODS:The uterine vasculature of adult Sprague Dawley rats (n=24) was examined 1 and 4 weeks postpartum (1PP, 4PP) and compared to late-pregnant (day 21, LP) and age-matched non-pregnant (NP) animals. Parameters of interest were: unstressed axial length, lumen diameter and wall thickness of the main uterine artery and vein (MUA, MUV) and proximal radial arteries (RA). Segmental artery (SA) length was also measured. Passive distensibility of RA was determined as a function of transmural pressure with pressure myography. Cross-sections of MUA stained to highlight collagen and elastin were imaged under light microscopy. Groups were compared by one-way ANOVA with tests for multiple comparisons, with significance at p<.05. Data are expressed as mean\u00b1 SE. RESULTS: MUA and SA length were significantly increased in LP, with vessels remaining significantly elongated at 1PP and 4PP. MUA diameter was increased in LP and remained enlarged at 1PP (p=.002), but regressed toward NP size at 4PP. There were no changes in wall thickness during or after pregnancy. The diameter of the MUV increased significantly in LP (p<.001), but regressed to NP size by 1PP. Passive distensibility decreased progressively during pregnancy and postpartum, with significant differences between NP and 4PP at all intraluminal pressures. The collagen:elastin ratio in MUA remained unchanged from NP through LP and 1PP, but increased significantly at 4PP. CONCLUSIONS: Some vascular adaptations incurred during pregnancy persist; even amplify, while others regress. Arterial compliance, as measured by distensibility, appears to increase postpartum through mechanisms that are not known. These lingering vascular changes warrant additional investigation.Sexually Dimorphic Expression of AM and IMD in PlacentalVilli and Effect of GDM on Their Expression.

INTRODUCTION: The objective for this study was to evaluate the utility of postpartum placental review for infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) unexpectedly in the immediate postpartum period. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study examined all infants admitted to the NICU from a postpartum floor at a single academic hospital over five years. An experienced pathologist and maternal-fetal medicine specialist reviewed the pathology reports to determine if the findings 1) were sufficient to be related to the admission and 2) would have implications on future pregnancy management. RESULTS: There were 219 infants were admitted to the NICU. Placental pathology review was performed on 68 infants (31%). Only 5 placentas (7%) were unremarkable. The most common pathologic findings were signs of infection (chorioamnionitis or villitis, 37%), meconium (19%), infarction (18%), and thrombus (18%). The findings in 15 placentas (22%) were sufficient to account for the \"rapid response\" trigger indication; an additional 12 cases had findings that are typically associated with poor outcomes but could not be considered causal. On clinical review, 28 (42%) had findings that may have implications on counseling and management for future pregnancies, including ultrasounds for monitoring fetal growth (25%), thrombophiliawork-up (19%), and viral infection evaluation (6%). Postpartum placenta review for infants admitted to the NICU during the immediate postpartum period provides clinically useful information. Nearly 25% of placental findings could potentially be related to the neonatal postpartum distress, and 42% of the results may impact the management of future pregnancies.Digital Pathology Analysis Reveals an Increased Trophoblast Apoptotic Burden in Normotensive andHypertensive Fetal Growth Restriction.

Toluwalope Junaid, 1 Robert Bradley, 2 John Aplin, 1 Edward Johnstone. 1 1 Maternal and Fetal Health Research Centre, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom; 2 Henry Mosley X-ray Imaging Facility, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom. INTRODUCTION:In human pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction (FGR), the placenta exhibits vascular defects 1 . We have shown size-related branching differences in chorionic arteries and extreme hypovascularity in the periphery of FGR placentas 2 ; we hypothesize these differences involve all vascular levels. Extraction of holistic information on the placental vascular network is therefore crucial, but has been limited by inadequate methods for demonstrating placental vascular connectivity and topology. To address this, we have devised a technique to achieve a detailed account of placental vascular morphology ex vivo, and have compared placentas from normal and FGR (individualised birth ratio (IBR) \u22645 th centile) complicated pregnancies. METHODS: 3D casts of the vessel networks of normal (n=12; 6 arterial, 6 venous) and FGR (n=12; 6 arterial, 6 venous) human placentas were prepared by corrosion casting. Each cast was X-rayed in a high resolution micro-CT scanner to generate 2000 slices which were reconstructed into a single volume 3D virtual object. Vessel segmentation and measurements were done by thresholding and spatial measure protocols in Avizo\u00ae computer-aided scientific visualisation software. Data (Mean\u00b1SEM) were compared by Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: The technique reproducibly defined vessel anatomy to 60\u00b5m resolution. As expected, placental area (PA) and weight (PW) differed significantly between the normal and FGR groups (35480\u00b13474mm 2 vs 22861\u00b12396mm 2 ; p=0.004 and 575.9\u00b133.75g vs 368.7\u00b127.36g; p=0.0006 respectively). Total vessel length was significantly shorter in FGR arterial casts (0.3\u00b10.04mm/mm 2 vs 0.5\u00b10.1mm/mm 2 ; p=0.03 and 15.6\u00b11.3mm/g vs 29.9\u00b14.6mm/g; p=0.009; adjusted for PA and PW respectively) but longer in the venous casts (1.4\u00b10.7mm/mm 2 vs 0.3\u00b10.05mm/mm 2 ; p=0.04 and 92\u00b147mm/g vs 20\u00b13mm/g; p=0.04). No significant differences were demonstrable in arterial or venous tortuosity or diameter. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the validity of micro-CT as an effective technique for ex vivo examination of human placental vessel morphology. Our findings show impoverished vascularity in the arterial but not the venous network of FGR placentas. The effect on placental blood flow, and hence nutrient supply to the fetus, is yet unknown.1 Krebs et al 1996, AJOG 175(6):1534-42. 2 Junaid et al 2014, Placenta 35(10):808-15.

The human SDF2 is similar to Arabidopsis thaliana SDF2-like protein, which is involved in ER stress response. Adverse environmental conditions lead to disruption of endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis causing accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins in ER and activating the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). UPR restores ER homeostasis, but if fails, cells go into apoptosis. In this study we investigated the SDF2 role in UPR in human placenta. METHODS: Primary cell culture of villous cytotrophoblast and BeWo cells were induced to ER stress with tunicamycin. Protein concentrations of SDF2 and GRP78/BiP were evaluated by Western Blot. Gene expression of SDF2, sXBP1 and CHOP were investigated through qPCR in SDF2silenced or not BeWo cells. Apoptosis and cell survival were evaluated by caspase-3 and ATP production luminescence assay. RESULTS: SDF2 is downregulated in CTBs after 3h and 24h of tunicamycin exposure. In BeWo cells it is downregulated after 6h of treatment and it is restored after 24h. GRP78/BiP is upregulated after 3h in CTBs, while in BeWo cells it is upregulated only after 24h. sXBP1 and CHOP mRNA confirmed ER stress condition. SDF2 mRNA did not change during tunicamycin treatment. In siRNA assays, CHOP was downregulated, GRP78/BiP activation was antecipated and the relation Caspase 3/ATP production was lower in the group SDF2-/-and treated for 3 and 6h with tunicamycin.CONCLUSIONS: Downregulation of CHOP, antecipation of GRP78/BiP and lower Caspase 3/ATP production in siRNA treated cells, indicate a role of SDF2 in the control of survival/apoptosis in trophoblast ER stress response. The placenta faces several changes in environmental conditions during development which could onset the UPR. Identifying new factors and key targets of this response could open a new field of investigation for gestation diseases. *Supported by FAPESP and CNPqThe Human Placenta at 41 Weeks of Gestation Shows Evidence of Aging With Shortened Telomeres, DNA Oxidation and Changes in IGFR2, Autophagy and the mTOR.

INTRODUCTION:Ex-vivo uterine environment (EVE) therapy uses an artificial placenta to provide extracorporeal gas exchange and nutrient delivery to a fetus submerged in an artificial uterus. Development of EVE therapy may allow us to treat very premature neonates without mechanical ventilation. In the present study, we analysed the efficacy and safety of our system, based on a parallelised umbilical circuit system with a low priming volume, using premature lamb model. METHODS: Ewes underwent surgical delivery at 115 d of gestation (GA; term is 148 d) to connect fetal extracorporeal life support to the umbilical vasculature in a parallel orientation (Treatment Group; n=5). Fetuses were transferred to an artificial uterus. Physiological parameters were continuously monitored; arterial blood gas and biochemistry values were serially obtained to assess wellbeing and targeted to reference range values for 2 d. Control Group animals (n=6) were surgically delivered at 117 d of GA. Fetal inflammation and surfactant proteins were analysed and compared between Treatment and Control Group using ELISA and qPCR. RESULTS: Fetal survival time in Treatment Group was 27.0 \u00b1 15.5 h (mean \u00b1 SD), whilst physiological parameters, arterial blood gas, and blood chemistry values were mainly kept within reference range. Fetal death in the Treatment Group prior to 45 h (3/5 animals) was unpredictable. There was no significant difference (p>0.05) in white blood cell count or surfactant mRNA expression between Treatment and Control Group. No significant elevation (p>0.05) in fetal plasma TNF-\u03b1 or MCP-1 protein was shown from 8 h after birth on. Significant elevation (p<0.01) in fetal lung mRNA expression of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-2 were demonstrated in Treatment Group compared to Control Group, whereas no significant difference (p>0.05) was observed in IL-1\u03b2 or TNF-\u03b1. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, limited survival of the fetus was achieved. However, EVE therapy induced limited fetal inflammation and did not promote lung maturation. These data suggest that further development of EVE therapy for extremely preterm infants is warranted.Comparison of Morbidities Associated With Previa Versus Non-Previa Placentation in Women WithPlacenta Accreta.

This correlated with signifiant variation in metabolic gene pathways (panel B). In validation analysis, PER1 is significantly upregulated only among GDMA1 (2.13-fold, p=0.01). Similarly, SOGA1 is significantly increased only among GDMA2 subjects (1.71-fold, p<0.01), while DOCK5 was found to be upregulated both in women with GDMA1 (1.58-fold, p=0.01) and GDMA2 (1.44-fold, p<0.01; panel C). *Figure(s) will be available online.

Carlos Salomon, 1 Miharu Kobayashi, 1 Sonia DaSilva-Arnold, 2 Greg E Rice, 1 Murray D Mitchell, 1 Nicholas P Illsley, 2 Abdulla Al-Khan, 2 Stacy Zamudio. 2 1 Centre for Clinical Diagnostics, University of Queensland Centre for Clinical Research, Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Queensland, Australia; 2 Center for Abnormal Placentation, Dept of Ob/Gyn, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ, USA.INTRODUCTION: AIP occurs when there is excessive trophoblast invasion into the maternal uterus, deep into the myometrial blood vessels, and even through the uterine serosa. The primary risk factor is placenta previa in conjunction with a uterine scar. AIP is associated with major hemorrhage, often necessitates hysterectomy and there can be invasion and damage to the bladder, bowel and other structures in the abdominal cavity. The generation of placental exosomes is altered in pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia. Given the excessive invasion and therefore increased contact with maternal blood, we hypothesized that placental exosomes might be increased in AIP vs. controls (placenta previa, PP). METHODS: Plasma was obtained from women diagnosed with PP and AIP (all percreta) at 30-34 weeks of gestation (n=4/group). Exosomes were isolated by differentialand buoyant density centrifugation. Exosomal markers (CD63 and TSG101) and a placenta-specific marker (placental alkaline phosphatase; PLAP) were measured by immunoblotting. PLAP content was normalized to total exosomal protein for the placental exosome fraction. Morphology was examined using EM and size distribution by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NanoSight\u2122). Exosomal protein content was established by mass spectrometry. The identified protein function and canonical pathways were determinedusing PANTHER and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, respectively. RESULTS: Exosomes were identified by EM as spherical vesicles with diameters around 100 nm which were positive for the exosome markers CD63 and TSG101. Plasma exosomal protein concentration in AIP was greater than that observed in PP (0.85\u00b10.17 vs. 0.66\u00b10.13 mg protein/ ml; p<0.05). There was a trend towards greater total exosome number in AIP (p=0.12) and a greater fraction being of placental origin (as measured by PLAP) in AIP (1.77\u00b10.26) vs. PP (1.00\u00b10.34; p=0.10). MS analysis identified common and unique exosomal proteins between AIP and PP involved in cytoskeleton organization, development, immunomodulatory and cell-to-cell communication. CONCLUSIONS: Exosome concentration and content appears to differ between women with AIP and PP.

INTRODUCTION:Interleukin-11 (IL-11) and IL-6 compete for binding to the gp130 receptor to mediate signaling in target cells. Although IL-11 maintains pregnancy, increased plasma and/or decidual cell IL-6 expression is associated with preeclampsia (PE) and chorioamnionitis (CAM). Expression of gp130, IL-6R and IL-11R by interstitial trophoblast suggest that decidual cell secreted IL-11/IL-6 act as paracrine factors on neighboring trophoblasts. Using whole genome analysis, this study investigated individual and combined effects of IL-11 and IL-6 on cytotrophoblast (CTB) gene expression. METHODS: Human CTBs were isolated from placenta after cesarean delivery (n=3). Microarray analysis was performed on RNA extracts from cultured CTB treated with control, or 1ng/ml of IL-11 or IL-6 or IL-11+IL-6 for 4 h using an Illumina Global Human Microarray kit. Statistical analysis focused on genes expressed at 1.5-fold over threshold. Relevant genes were confirmed by qRT-PCR and immunostaining of placental sections obtained from normal (n=6), PE (n=6) and CAM (n=7) associated pregnancies. RESULTS: In IL11-treated CTBs vs. controls, 142 genes are differentially expressed (18 up-and 124 down-regulated). In IL6-treated CTBs vs. controls, 243 genes are differentially expressed (120 up-and 123 downregulated). After incubation of CTBs with IL11+IL6 vs. IL11, 7 genes are differentially expressed (4 up-and 3 down-regulated). Among 3 downregulated genes, ISG15 was confirmed by qRT-PCR. HSCORE analysis of immunostaining revealed that compared to normal placenta, interstitial CTBs in preeclamptic placenta, but not in CAM associated placenta, express significantly lower ISG15 immunoreactivity (Mean \u00b1 SEM 139.7\u00b111.4, 59.0\u00b114.2 and 86.6\u00b122.4, respectively; p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that differential regulation of IL11-mediated gene expression by IL6 in CTBs promote decidual autoinflammation by inhibiting ISG15, which in turn elicits the development of inflammatory milieu in PE. Thus, compounds increasing ISG15 expression may exert therapeutic benefits by preventing inflammation in PE.Supported by McKern Award to UAKEpigenetic Regulation of Placental HSD11B2 Identifies Class-Specific HDAC and DNMT Inhibitors as Novel Protective Pharmacotherapy for the Human Placenta. Katie L Togher, 1,2 Jason Radford, 2 Louise C Kenny, 1 Gerard W O'Keeffe. 1,2 1 Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research (INFANT), Cork University Maternity Hospital, Cork, Munster, Ireland; 2 Department of Anatomy & Neuroscience, University College Cork, Cork, Munster, Ireland. INTRODUCTION:Fetal overexposure to maternal cortisol has been proposed to increase the risk of low birth weight and later disease risk. Placental 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 (HSD11B2) protects the fetus by inactivating cortisol. Environmental stress and infection during pregnancy is correlated with reduced HSD11B2 expression, potentially resulting in fetal overexposure to cortisol. However, this has not been directly shown and there is no preventative pharmacotherapy. METHODS: Single cell densitometry was used to quantify HSD11B2 expression in JEG-3 cells post exposure to cortisol(0-2mM), IL-1\u03b2(1-100ng/ml), DNA methyltransferase(DNMT) inhibitor Decitabine and Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors SAHA, MC1568, MS275 and PCI (all 1-10mM). For in vivo analyses, pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats received each inhibitor (0.1-1mg/kg) intraperitoneally on E16 and placental HSD11B2 expression and fetal characteristics were examined on E18. RESULTS: Exposure to cortisol and IL-1\u03b2 resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in HSD11B2 expression in JEG-3 cells. Pan and Class-specific HDAC and DNMT inhibitors resulted in a dose-dependent increase in HSD11B2 expression in vitro and protected JEG3 cells against the detrimental effects of Cortisol and IL-1\u03b2 on HSD11B2 expression, and we also extended these analyses in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: We show that cortisol and IL-1\u03b2 directly affect placental HSD11B2 expression, and that class-specific inhibitors of HDAC and DNMTs have potential as protective pharmacotherapy against the effects on stress and infection on the developing fetus.Oxidative Stress and Compensatory Anti-Inflammatory Mechanismsin the Placentas of Gravid Marijuana Smokers. Michelle C Tsai, Matthew Loichinger, Tricia Wright. Department of OB/GYN, University of Hawaii John A. Burns School of Medicine, Honolulu, HI, USA.INTRODUCTION: \u03b1-Klotho is a membrane-associated protein expressed in placental syncytiotrophoblast. It regulates phosphatemediated oxidative stress and may affect the function and lifespan of the placenta. Human sirtuin-1 (SIRT-1) down-regulates cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases, and prostaglandins. SIRT-1 has been well-studied in the human placenta and has been shown to confer a protective effect against oxidative stress. The aim of the study was to determine the effects of marijuana on fetal growth and investigate placental \u03b1-Klotho and SIRT-1 in gravid marijuana smokers compared to normal gestational age matched controls. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study. The control group (N=10) included women with uncomplicated term pregnancies. Marijuana users (N=9) included term women with documented marijuana use during pregnancy without any other substance abuse, including alcohol or tobacco. Placental samples were collected immediately after delivery, formalin fixed, placed in paraffin blocks and sectioned. \u03b1-Klotho polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) and Vectorstain ELITE kit (Vector Labs) were used for immunocytochemistry and quantitation performed with a CRI Nuance spectral analyzer. Student's T-test was used with significance set at p<0.05.RESULTS:Patient demographics were similar between groups. Placental \u03b1-Klotho expression was not significantly different between groups (p=0.41). There was no significant difference in SIRT-1 expression in the placental vascular endothelium (p=0.3) or syncytiotrophoblast (p=0.42) between groups. Neonates born to mothers who smoked marijuana weighed significantly less (477g; 1.05lbs) than babies born to normal controls (p=0.01). *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking marijuana in pregnancy did not have an effect on placental \u03b1-Klotho or SIRT-1 expression in this small cohort of patients. However, birth weights of term infants born to mothers who smoked marijuana during pregnancy were significantly less than those born to normal control mothers.Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Is Induced in the HumanPlacenta During Labour.

Using clinically established cutoff values for postpartum cardiovascular markers, we show significantly more patients with a low HDL (20.7% vs. 48.3% p=0.026) and high homocysteine (17.2% vs. 65.5% p=<0.001) in the PE group. CONCLUSIONS: Preeclampsia is associated with lower T cell numbers and other characteristic inflammatory and vascular changes to the spiral arteries of the placental bed, resembling several features of early atherosclerosis. We hypothesize that lower T-cell presence may cause increased innate immunity activity with subsequent decreased EVT migration and abnormal SA remodelling in early stages of pregnancies destined to be complicated by PE.Increased Prohibitin-1 Expression Contributes To IncreasedOxidative Stress in Preeclamptic Placentas. Yuping Wang, Yang Gu, Lynn J Groome. Obstetrics & Gynecology, LSU Health Sciences Center, Shreveport, LA, USA. INTRODUCTION: Prohibitins (PHB1 and PHB2) are mitochondria proteins located at the inner mitochondria membrane. Although PHBs are required for optimal mitochondrial morphology and function, the precise molecular function of PHBs in the placenta is unknown. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been reported in placental trophoblasts in preeclampsia (PE). However, placental PHB expression and their function associated with oxidative stress have never been studied in PE. We hypothesis that increased PHB expression may contribute to deregulation of anti-oxidative activity in placental trophoblast cells (TCs) in PE. METHODS: PHB1 and PHB2 expression was determined by Western blot using total tissue protein and by immunostaining of paraffin embedded tissue sections in 14 placentas, 7 normal and 7 PE. To specifically study effects of PHB1 associated with oxidative stress, PHB1 siRNA was transfected into primary isolated TCs from normal placentas. TC MnSOD and CuZnSOD expression was determined by Western blot and TC oxidative stress was determined by measuring 8-isoprostane production. A probability level <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Relative expression of PHB1 and PHB2 was significantly increased in PE placentas compared to normal term placentas, PHB1: 1.61\u00b10.16 vs. 0.88\u00b10.05, p<0.05; PHB2: 1.29\u00b10.10 vs. 0.85\u00b10.06, p<0.05.",

INTRODUCTION: Fetal growth restriction(FGR), which causes perinatal morbidity and mortality, is characterized by birth weight and body mass being below 10th percentile for gestational age. FGR babies are prone to develop cardiovascular diseases later in life. Inadequate placental transfer of nutrients from mother to fetus due to placental insufficiency is considered the underlying cause of FGR. Recently, we demonstrated that blockade of cystathionine-\u03b3-lyase (CSE) activity induces preeclampsia-like condition in pregnant mice. We hypothesized that defect in cystathionine-b-synthase (CBS) / H 2 S pathway may promote FGR. METHODS: Placental CBS expressions were determined in women with FGR (n=9) and normal controls",

Pt survey included women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who had been pregnant in the past 2 years. RESULTS: 22 OBGYN and 50 DS completed the doctor survey. 57 RA and 56 IBD pts completed the pt survey. When planning pregnancy 50% of pts consulted their OBGYN and 43% their DS. On learning of pregnancy 66% of pts consulted their OBGYN and 34% their DS. For OBGYN 40% of initial visits were prior to pregnancy, with 35% in 1st trimester. For DS 68% of initial visits were prior to pregnancy. During pregnancy OBGYN saw 69% of pts once a month or more, 28% every trimester and 3% only once during pregnancy. 88% and 83% of pts reported that OBGYNs and DS respectively were very influential on how they managed their pregnancy. A treatment plan related to management of RA/IBD or pregnancy was initiated by OBGYN for 55% of pts. This was 56% for DS. 34% of OBGYNs made treatment changes in anticipation of or during pregnancy. This was 60% for rheumatologists and 27% for gastroenterologists. 82% of OBGYN collaborated with other physicians when managing pts, with disease progression and pregnancy monitoring key discussion topics. CONCLUSIONS: Although patients had a high level of interaction with both their DS and OBGYN throughout pregnancy, only about half had a treatment plan in place.

The purpose of these analyses is to use data from an ongoing study to assess whether maternal stress during pregnancy is associated with neonate inflammation regulation in cord blood. METHODS: Pregnant women are recruited during their 1st trimester. Maternal stress during pregnancy is associated with less neonate regulatory control of inflammation, as manifest by IL6:IL10 ratio at delivery. These analyses suggest that maternal stress experienced during pregnancy may affect neonate inflammatory activity. Future studies should further investigate this relationship and determine links with adverse pregnancy and child health outcomes. The presence of TLRs within AMC suggests a role in infection surveillance within the FM. AMC are shown to be capable of activating the proinflammatory NF-\u03baB pathway in the presence of an infectious stimulus, MALP-2, providing further evidence that TLRs could exacerbate FM weakening and result in PPROM. Better understanding of the mechanisms involved in infection-induced PPROM will greatly benefit the obstetric field by preventing and refining treatments for women that experience PPROM, thus advancing neonatal outcomes.",

INTRODUCTION:Prior studies have demonstrated that the selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM), UPA, effectively controlled bleeding and reduced fibroid volume, with African American (AA) women having a greater reduction in fibroid size. An additional benefit of this therapy is therapeutic amenorrhea without hypoestrogenic symptoms. The objective of this study was to determine if race or other demographic factors are associated with amenorrhea in women taking UPA for treatment of leiomyoma. METHODS: This study was a subgroup analysis from two prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trials at a clinical research center. Information on dosage, age, pregnancy history, body mass index, race, bleeding, and time to amenorrhea was obtained from the medical records of women enrolled in a clinical trial of UPA. RESULTS: Fifty-one African American (AA) and thirteen non-AA premenopausal women underwent treatment with UPA at 10 mg, 20 mg, or placebo. After conclusion of treatment, no patients receiving placebo demonstrated amenorrhea compared to 73.9% receiving UPA (p<0.05). The factor that was most associated with amenorrhea was treatment with UPA (p <.0001). There was no difference in amenorrhea rates between AA and Caucasian women (p=0.75). Women with amenorrhea experienced fewer cycles with an LH surge (p=0.038). Prior to the development of amenorrhea, women who subsequently developed amenorrhea were likely to bleed for longer periods of time (p= 0.04). Demographic factors such as age, parity and BMI were not associated with amenorrhea. CONCLUSIONS: UPA treatment was the strongest predictor of amenorrhea. There were no racial differences in amenorrhea rates. All patients receiving UPA, at the study dosages, should be expected to have high rates of amenorrhea regardless of other demographic and reproductive health characteristics.Effect of GnRH Agonist on MED12 Wild Type and Mutated UterineFibroids.

INTRODUCTION: Uterine fibroids are characterized by growth dependence on sex steroids and medical treatment that reduces menstrual bleeding and fibroid size is classically based on sex steroid depletion, for example by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy. Recently exome sequencing revealed mutations in the MED12 gene in up to the 70% of uterine fibroids.

INTRODUCTION: Uterine Fibroids (UF) are a common benign tumor of reproductive age women. For women with symptomatic fibroids, there are paucity of therapeutic options, probably limited to myomectomy. However long term outcome of myomectomy is often hampered by high rate of recurrence (up to 60%).The role of stem cells in fibroid pathogenesis is being established by our group and others. Persistence of tumor-forming stem cells might be contributing to recurrence of fibroid.We have been developing adenovirus gene therapy as a potential non-surgical treatment of fibroids. In this work, we are aiming to examine the utility of Adenovirus serotype 5 to transduce human fibroid stem cells.Our central hypothesis is that efficient transduction and subsequent elimination of fibroid tumor forming stem cells is pivotal step for complete tumor eradication and decreasing recurrence. METHODS: Samples of human leiomyomas were dissected out and minced into small pieces and incubated overnight.Afterward, samples were digested with agitation by type II collagenase to obtain singlecell suspensions. These cells were analyzedand sorted using specific stem cell markers. Isolated stem cells were grown in culture.Then we used replication incompetent Adenovirus serotype 5 expressing the B-Galactosidase as a reporter gene to transfect these stem cells. The virus load used ranged from 1 plaque forming units (PFU) per cell which represents multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 and scaled upto 50pfu/cell. RESULTS: Human fibroid stem cells showed expression of B-Galactosidase at (MOI) of 1,10,and 50 at a percentages of 19%,62%,and 90% respectively.This rate of transduction is comparable to that of primary fibroid tumor cells that showed transduction rates of 28%,82%,and 98% at the same MOI respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Fibroid stem cells are susceptible to transduction by Adenovirus 5. These data are promising in that Adenovirus-based gene therapy could be a novel strategy to eradicate both differentiated fibroid cells as well as tumor-forming stem cells which might improve long term tumor ablation and decrease possible recurrence. Both first and second authors contributed equally.Inhibitory Effects of Curcumin and Nanocurcumin on Human UterineLeiomyoma Xenograft Model In Vivo.

INTRODUCTION: Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas) are benign tumors of the myometrium that occur in approximately 70% of reproductive-age women. Previously, we have shown that the AKT pathway is upregulated in leiomyoma compared to normal myometrium. In leiomyoma cells, inhibition of AKT promotes senescence and inhibits growth. However, it is unclear why AKT is overactive in leiomyomas. We hypothesize that oxidative stress caused by an intrinsic dysregulation of the redox system activates the AKT pathway and promotes survival in leiomyomas. METHODS: Primary leiomyoma (ULM) and myometrial (MM) cells isolated from tissues post surgery were used. Western Blotting, immunohistochemistry as well as biochemical and cell-based assay including WST-1, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH) quantification were performed. RESULTS: Pro-oxidative stimuli (H 2 O 2 ) increased pAKT levels in ULM cells but not in MM cells. Interestingly, while high doses of H 2 O 2 reduced ULM cell viability, viability of MM cells was not affected. MnSOD is the primary defense against oxidative stress in cells. Acetylation of MnSOD leads to accumulation of inactive MnSOD. Immunostaining of a tissue microarray containing over 100 matched leiomyoma/myometrial tissues showed that levels of acetylated MnSOD were higher in leiomyomas than in matched myometrium. Moreover, the MnSOD mimetic GC4419 reduced pAKT protein levels in ULM cells supporting our hypothesis. Inhibition of AKT with MK-2206 led to cell death in ULM cells at doses that increased superoxide levels and decreased GSH. The cytotoxic effects of MK-2206 were reversed by GC4419, suggesting that MK-2206 triggers oxidant-induced cell death of ULM cells by impairing the GSH/ ROS balance. CONCLUSIONS: Leiomyomas have an impaired oxidative system due to the aberrant acetylation of MnSOD. This oxidative environment, likely sustained by the hypoxic milieu of leiomyomas, upregulates the AKT pathway. Therefore, targeting the AKT pathway is a rational approach for fibroid therapy without affecting the myometrium.Vitamin D Elicits Anti-InflammatoryResponsein Human FemaleDetrusor Muscle Cells: Implication for Overactive Bladder Syndrome.

INTRODUCTION: Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) occurs when the pelvic floor no longer supports the pelvic organs, causing them to herniate. Our previous published work has shown the upregulation of TLR pathway in the Round (RL) and Uterosacral (USL) ligaments of women with POP. Therefore, our aims are 1) to develop viable ligament explant cultures for mechanistic experiments 2) to develop primary culture techniques to study receptor activation and 3) to characterize TLR expression. While we concentrated on control samples, we aim to compare POP and control ligament samples. METHODS: USL and RL were collected during hysterectomy with IRB approval. They were washed in 1x PBS and three 3 mm tissue punches were sampled: (1) placed in fixative for histology, placed into paraffin blocks, sectioned and immunohistochemistry was performed for TLR 2 (1:50 Abcam), 4 (1:50 Santa Cruz) and 6 (1:100 Santa Cruz) (2) weighed and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, (3) placed in culture with DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Pen/Strep. After 24 hrs the explant tissue (3) was transferred into new media and the old media frozen for LDH detection. After 5 days explants were fixed. Ligament remnants were chopped and placed into DMEM/F12 with trypsin (2mg/ml) and collagenase A (5mg/ml) at 37\u00b0C at 200 rpm for 1 hr. The samples were filtered, centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 mins and the cell pellet resuspended in media plus 10% FBS and 1% Pen/Strep. Cell linage was confirmed by vimentin (1:100, abcam) immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: We demonstrated ability to isolate and culture cells from ligaments using our novel isolation protocol. We passed these cells and demonstrated fibroblastic lineage by vimentin immunocytochemistry. We show that these cells are not robust enough to survive a freezing process, and need to be utilized for experiments upon isolation and culture. We characterized an explant model for uterine ligaments and were able to keep these in culture for five days to demonstrate their viability window by LDH activity, histological cytoarchitecture and apoptosis/necrosis analysis. Finally, we demonstrated the expression of TLR 2, 4 and 6 in both USL and RL by immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the ability to collect and develop new methods to culture human ligaments for downstream assays. Therefore receptor characterization assay and functional significance studies are ongoing.Vitamin D Inhibits Interleukin-1\u03b2 Induced Increase in Contractile Proteins in Primary Detrussor Smooth Muscle Cells of UrinaryBladder. Archana Laknaur, 1 Ahsen R Chaudhry, 2 Ayman Al-Hendy, 1 Chandrasekhar Thota. 2 1 Obstetrics and Gynecology, Georgia Regents University, Augusta, GA, USA; 2 Obstetrics and Gynecology, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, TN, USA. INTRODUCTION: African American (AA) women have lower levels of vitamin D. Similarly postmenopausal women, irrespective of the race were reported to exhibit hypovitaminosis D due to reduced synthesis of vitamin D. Both African American and postmenopausal women are known to be susceptible to infections and are reported to have a higher incidence of overactive bladder. Since Vitamin (vit)D has been reported to play an important role in innate and adaptive immunities, subclinical infection in women with low levels of vit D may increase inflammation and expression of contractile proteins in detrusor smooth muscle cells and thereby increase incidence of overactive bladder. The objective of the study is to assess if 1,25(OH)2 vit D (Vit D3) administration can decrease interleukin(IL)-1\u03b2 induced increase in contractile proteins in detrussor smooth muscle cells obtained from urinary bladder of an AA woman. METHODS: Primary detrussor smooth muscle cells isolated from an AA woman's urinary bladder were obtained from Lifeline Cell Technology and cultured as suggested by the supplier. At confluence, cells were incubated in medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum for 24 h and were treated in triplicates with different concentrations of Vit D3 (1.0, 10, 100 nM) for 24 and 48h. Detrussor muscle cells were also treated in triplicates with different concentrations of IL-1\u03b2 ( 0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 ng/ml). In a separate experiment cells were treated in triplicate with different concentrations of vit D3 (1.0, 10, 100 nM) in the presence of known concentration of IL-1\u03b2 (10ng/ml). RNA was isolated a using Qiagen kit after 24h and protein was extracted using RIPA buffer after 48h. Real time PCR and western analysis were performed to measure cytokines and contractile proteins using appropriate primers and antibodies. RESULTS: Vit D3 treatment caused a dose dependent decrease (p<0.05) in the mRNA expression of cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL6, IL8, TNF\u03b1, Connexin-43, cox2. Western analysis showed a decrease (P<0.05) in Connexin-43 and cox2 expression. Vit D3 decreased (p<0.05) IL-1\u03b2 induced increase (p<0.05) in connexin-43 and cox2 expression. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that vit D3 reduces proinflammatory cytokines and contractile proteins and inhibits IL-1\u03b2 induced increase in contractile proteins in detrussor smooth muscle cells of urinary bladder.Secondary Vestibulodynia Is Associated With IL-4 PromoterVariant in Caucasian Women. Joshua Miles, 1 Martha Monson, 2 Jessica Hebert, 1 Mayu Morita, 1 Terry Morgan. 1 1 Ob/Gyn and Pathology, OHSU, Portland, OR, USA; 2 Obstetrics & Gynecology, University of Utah, SLC, UT, USA. INTRODUCTION: Provoked localized vulvodynia(PLV, vestibulodynia)   affects approximately 10% of women. It is the leading cause of painful sex and the cause is unknown. We have shown there is significant neurogenic inflammation in vestibular biopsies from these patients compared with carefully matched unaffected controls. This tissue pathology is very similar to interstital cystitis (painful bladder), which occurs in about 20% of PLV patients. Although PLV is not currently considered to be a genetic disease, numerous studies suggest interstital cystitis has genetic risk factors, including an association with an IL-4 promoter variant that predisposes patients to hypersensitivity reactions. We hypothesized this IL-4 variant will be associated with PLV. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 512 DNA samples from 271 white unaffected negative controls (no history of PLV, or family history), 119 primary PLV cases, and 122 secondary cases diagnosed in our Program of Vulvar Health by gynecologists with more than 14 years of experience with this disease. Women with primary PLV had experienced pain at the first introital touch; whereas, women with secondary PLV experienced pain only after a prior period of pain-free intercourse. Clinical charts were reviewed to screen for a history of interstitial cystitis and allergies.",

INTRODUCTION: Bacterial vaginosis(BV)is the most common type of abnormal vaginal flora. Treatment of BV is performed with metronidazole and remains a challenge at clinical practice. Cervicovaginal fluid proteomic profile in BV has been evaluated in a few studies, however how it is related with the response to treatment of this condition has not been elucidated so far. Thus, we aimed to characterize the cervicovaginal proteome of women with BV in relation to normal flora and to compare the proteomic profile between those women who were successfully treated with women who failed to reestablish lactobacillar flora after 7-days metronidazole regimen METHODS: We cross-sectionally enrolled 150 women, but 15 had to be excluded because they tested positive for Chlamydia trachomatis and/or Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Vaginal flora was classified according to Nugent's criteria and showed that 38 women had bacterial vaginosis, 15 intermediate and 82 normal flora. Cervicovaginal samples of the 38 women with BV and 38 randomly selected women with normal flora were evaluated by shotgun LC-MS/MS (Q-Tof Ultima, MicroMass/Waters).",

INTRODUCTION: The vaginal pH is 3.8-4.5 due to lactic acidproducing bacteria, primarily Lactobacilli. Vaginal glycogen is degraded by host-derived alpha amylase and converted to lactic acid by bacteria. In women with bacterial vaginosis (BV) Lactobacilli are replaced by anaerobic and facultative microbes and the vaginal pH is elevated. Conversely, the vaginal microbiota and vaginal pH remains unaltered in women with vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). Since alpha amylase is the substrate for Lactobacilli we evaluated whether its concentration was altered in vaginal fluid from women with BV and VVC and its associations with vaginal lactic acid and host mediators.Underutilization of Metabolic Screening Studies in Patients WithPolycystic Ovary Syndrome.

INTRODUCTION: Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have an increased risk for metabolic abnormalities including glucose intolerance, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. In 2002, the American College of Obstetrics & Gynecology (ACOG) published recommendationsthat all patients with PCOS should undergo a 2-hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) and lipid profile. Our primary objective was to identify the number of patients with a diagnosis of PCOS that have undergone this screening by their referring physician. METHODS: An IRB-approved retrospective chart review was performed on 157 patients (age 18-50 years) referred to our university-affiliated reproductive endocrinology and infertility practice between January 2010 and December 2012 with a diagnosis of PCOS based on Rotterdam criteria. Data collected comprised of age at time of initial consultation, criteria for diagnosis of PCOS, referring physician specialty, medical history, physical exam findings, and laboratory values including 2-hour GTT and fasting lipid profile. Chi-square analysis and logistic regression were performed using SigmaPlot 11.0, Systat Software, Inc, San Jose, CA; p<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Patients were referred by general gynecologists (n=105), outside reproductive endocrinologists (n=25), primary care physicians (n=19), medical endocrinologists (n=7), and unknown providers (n=23). Prior to initial consultation in our clinic, only 9.3% of patients had a 2-hour GTT and 23.6% had a lipid profile performed. Among those who had the above testing done prior to or after initial consultation, we found that patients were more likely to be tested for dyslipidemia based on higher body mass index (BMI) [p=0.02] and based on race/ethnicity, particularly in Hispanic women [p=0.003]. BMI, race/ethnicity, and family history of diabetes did not appear to contribute to likelihood of testing for glucose intolerance [p>0.05]. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate that the vast majority of patients diagnosed with PCOS are not undergoing the appropriate screening tests for glucose intolerance and dyslipidemia, despite current ACOG recommendations. Routine practices of providers caring for PCOS patients must be explored to determine the obstacles in obtaining appropriate metabolic screening in this high risk population.",

Obstetrics and Gynecology and 2 Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA. INTRODUCTION: In PCOS, MNC exhibit increased sensitivity to saturated fat ingestion. This triggers inflammation potentiated in obese individuals by a concomitant rise in circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS).We evaluated the status of plasma LPS and TLR-2, TLR-4 and SOC-3 protein content from MNC in the fasting state in women with PCOS compared with ovulatory controls; and their relation to insulin sensitivity and the ovarian androgen response to HCG administration. METHODS: We studied 16 women with PCOS (8 lean, 8 obese) between ages 18-40, diagnosed on the basis of oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenemia, and 16 ovulatory controls (8 lean, 8 obese) of similar age. Plasma LPS was measured by fluorescence and TLR-2, TLR-4 and SOC-3 protein content were quantified by Western blotting in MNC isolated from fasting blood samples within 5-8 days of menses. Insulin sensitivity was derived by IS OGTT . Androgens were measured from blood samples drawn at 0, 24, 48 and 96 hours after administration of a 5000 IU IM HCG injection. RESULTS: Fasting LPS was similar in all 4 groups. Compared with lean controls, lean and obese women with PCOS and obese controls exhibited greater TLR-2 (4.1\u00b10.7 vs. 7.8\u00b11.4, 8.8\u00b10.8, 6.7\u00b11.1, p<0.02), TLR-4 (6.7\u00b10.7 vs. 8.7\u00b10.7, 9.6\u00b10.5, 8.8\u00b10.9, p<0.05) and SOCS-3 (4.2\u00b10.5 vs. 7.5\u00b10.8, 7.6\u00b10.9, 6.4\u00b11.0, p<0.02). Compared with weight-matched controls, women with PCOS exhibited greater area under the curve (AUC) following HCG administration for testosterone (T) (lean: 6351\u00b1849 vs. 4010\u00b1340, p<0.05; obese: 7076\u00b11236 vs. 3728\u00b1226, p<0.006), and androstenedione (A) (lean: 472\u00b126 vs. 317\u00b126, p<0.0008; obese: 511\u00b115 vs. 315\u00b142, p<0.0001). IS OGTT was negatively correlated with TLR-2 In PCOS, TLR-2, TLR-4 and SOCS-3 are increased in the fasting state independent of obesity, and may account for increased MNC sensitivity to saturated fat ingestion. This phenomenon may promote insulin resistance and atherogenesis, the latter of which may be perpetuated by hyperandrogenism.Increased Rate of Oocyte Loss in PCOS Patients Corresponds ToDiminished Fecundity Compared To Non-PCOS Patients. Creighton E Likes III, Rebecca C Crowe, Bruce A Lessey, David A Forstein, Paul B Miller, William E Roudebush. Obstetrics & Gynecology, Greenville Health System, Greenville, SC, USA. INTRODUCTION:Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) production by ovarian granulosa cells during the reproductive years are representative of the ovarian reserve. AMH is significantly higher in women with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). The study objective examined the association between AMH, age, and pregnancy potential in women with and without PCOS. METHODS: AMH levels, diagnoses, and demographics was analyzed between groups of low (<1), normal (1-4), and high (>4) AMH levels, groups of women ages 20-29, 30-34, and over 35 years of age, as well as groups of women with and without PCOS (Rotterdam criteria). Monitored cycles were compared between groups with the primary outcome being successful pregnancy. RESULTS: A total of 173 patients were included: 64, PCOS and 109, controls. AMH over time confirms higher levels in PCOS patients as compared to controls. *Figure(s) will be available online. Linear regression showed a faster rate of AMH decline, and thus ovarian reserve, in women with PCOS compared to controls. Overall pregnancy rate was 42% for both PCOS and control, and was broken down to examine rates within different age groups For ages 20-29, 54.8% of PCOS patients had successful outcomes compared to controls (48.6%). For ages 30-34, 39.1% of PCOS patients had successful outcomes compared to controls (52.5%). For women over 35, 10.0% of PCOS patients had successful outcomes compared to controls (23.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Higher AMH levels in women with PCOS contribute to a greater pregnancy potential in younger patients. However, as the PCOS patient ages, the rate of egg loss, measured by decreasing AMH, is greater than that of patients without PCOS. This increased rate of egg loss results in decreased fecundity in the older PCOS group when compared to older non-PCOS patients.Differential MicroRNA Regulation in PCOS ThecaCells. Bhavi Modi, 1 Kellie Archer, 2 Jan McAllister, 3 Jerome Strauss. 1,4 1 Human & Molecular Genetics, Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), Richmond, VA, USA; 2 Biostatistics, VCU, Richmond, VA, USA; 3 Pathology, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA; 4 Obstetrics & Gynecology, VCU, Richmond, VA, USA. INTRODUCTION: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a multisystem disorder with a complex pathophysiology. Hyperandrogenemia of ovarian theca cell origin is a consistent feature of PCOS. MicroRNAs (miRs) are small, non-coding RNA molecules involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation. There is evidence for differential miR expression in the ovarian stroma, follicular fluid and granulosa cells of normal cycling andSaturday Posterswomen with PCOS. However, miR expression and target gene analyses in normal and PCOS theca cells is lacking. PCOS theca cells display differentially expressed mRNAs, which could be explained, in part by miR regulation. Understanding gene expression and its regulation in theca cells may represent a key to understanding the hyperandrogenemia associated with PCOS. METHODS: MicroRNA deep sequencing studies (Study 1: n=16; Study 2: n=8 samples) were performed on total RNA isolated from cultured normal (C: Control) and PCOS (D: Diseased) theca cells treated with (T) and without (U) 20 \u00b5M forskolin. To identify miRs differentially expressed across several group comparisons an ANOVA model was fit to the log 2 normalized expression levels, for each study and each miR. Meta-analysis was used to obtain a combined p-value of both studies. Identification of target mRNAs and pathway analysis was performed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool. RESULTS: A total of 5,936 miRs were identified in theca cells. The numbers of miRs differentially expressed for each comparison (metaanalysis FDR < 0.05) are T vs U (44); CU vs CT (31); DU vs DT (11); CT vs DT (39) and CU vs DU (79). Ten differentially expressed miRs were identified to be common between CT vs DT and CU vs DU groups (hsa-miRs: -100, -125a,",

Gihan M Bareh, RandalRobinson, Ethan Jacoby, Peter Binkley, Peter Nathanielsz, Robert Schenken. Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX, USA. INTRODUCTION: Since the advent of intracytoplasmic sperm injection in 1992, sperm retrieval procedures have been routinely employed to treat male infertility. The anatomical location of harvested sperm (testicle or epididymis) might influence sperm DNA integrity and reproductive outcomes. Our objective was to compare sperm DNA damage in epidydimal sperm with testicular sperm METHODS: Prospective cohort animal study. This was an IRB and IACUC exempt protocol. Testicular and epidydimal tissues of 6 baboons were collected at time of necropsy. Testicular tissue was fixed and embedded in paraffin blocks sectioned for further evaluation. Epididymal flushing was used to collect epidydimal spermatozoa and smears were prepared and fixed. DNA fragmentation of the sperm from both tissue sources was assessed with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). Slides were analyzed with confocal microscopy. The percentage of DNA damage was calculated using computerized software and results are expressed as mean +/-standard deviation. P value was considered significant when <0.05. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference in age was noted among all baboons (P>0.5).Testicular sperm was observed to have significantly lower rates of DNA damage compared to epididymal sperm (RR 0.26; CI 0.076-0.60; P< 0.001). *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Testicular spermatozoa have less DNA damage compared to epididymal sperm collected on the same day. Thus the anatomical location of sperm extraction may affect reproductive outcome and should be discussed when counseling patients.Obese Men With Asthenozoospermia Have Increased Sperm MotilityWith Neutral Endopeptidase (NEP) Inhibition. Jayme S Bosler, 1,4 Shibo Fu, 2 Ilir Agalliu, 3,2 Sangita Jindal, 4 Kelvin P Davies, 2 Genevieve S Neal-Perry.1,4 1 Obstetrics, Gynecology and Women's Health, Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA; 2 Urology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA; 3 Epidemiology and Population Health, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA; 4 Obstetrics and Gynecology, Montefiore's Institute for Reproductive Medicine and Health, Hartsdale, NY, USA. INTRODUCTION:Neutral endopeptidase (NEP) is hypothesized to reduce human sperm motility through mechanisms that affect proteolysis of seminal peptides. Synthetic NEP inhibitors increase sperm motility when added to semen. We have shown both NEP and opiorphin, a potent endogenous NEP inhibitor, are abundant in seminal plasma. Although opiorphin is found in semen, it's relevance in seminal plasma and sperm, is unknown. Interestingly, blood plasma NEP activity increases with metabolic syndrome and increased BMI. We hypothesize that obese men with idiopathic asthenozoospermia have increased NEP activity and exogenous opiorphin will increase their sperm motility compared to non-obese men. METHODS: Semen samples from 55 men presenting to the Montefiore's Institute of Reproductive Medicine and Health for routine semen analysis were assessed for motility before and after the addition of 200\u00b5M of opiorphin. Men with azoospermia were excluded from the analysis. Samples were incubated at 37 o C for at least 30 minutes prior to analysis for liquefaction. Motility and forward progression were immediately assessed in triplicate and per World Health Organization (WHO) 2010 guidelines.",

INTRODUCTION: Fanconi anemia (FA), dyskeratosis congenita (DC) and Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) are inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS) associated with high risks of bone marrow failure, leukemia and solid tumors. Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) levels are significantly reduced in reproductive-aged females with FA and DC. AMH levels may also be reduced in males with IBMFS. METHODS: Serum AMH levels were measured in post-pubertal males with FA (n=9; age 16-37 yr), DC (n=21; 15-46 yr), and DBA (n=14; 16-58 yr) within the well-characterized NCI cohort of IBMFS and two age-matched male control groups: unaffected relatives (FA=14, 14-38 yr; DC=18, 16-48 yr; DBA=11, 31-62 yr) and healthy, unrelated volunteers (n=20, 18-47 yr). AMH levels were compared between case and control groups using Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests; p<0.05 was significant. RESULTS: Males with FA had lower AMH levels (median=5 ng/ml, BMT) 7 to 13 years prior to AMH measurement, and 1 had head/neck cancer at study. There was no difference in AMH levels in FA patients with or without hypogonadism, or with or without BMT. Males with DC had lower AMH levels (3.9, 0-8.9) compared with relatives (5.3, 1.2-17.8, p<0.04) or unrelated controls (p<0.001). All 6 married DC patients had children, 1 with hypogonadism had AMH of 0 ng/ml, and 2 patients who previously had cancer were cancer-free at study. Eight DC patients had 1 or more manifestations of severe clinical disease (mucocutaneous triad of nail dystrophy/oral leukoplakia/reticulated skin pigmentation (n=8), severe bone marrow failure",

Jennifer L Marino, 1 Christobel M Saunders, 2,3 Laura I Emery, 2 Helena Green, 3 Dorota A Doherty, 4 Martha Hickey. 1 1 Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Univ. Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia; 2 Surgery, Univ. Western Australia, Perth, Australia; 3 Menopause Symptoms after Cancer Clinic, King Edward Memorial Hosp., Perth, Australia; 4 Women's and Infants' Health, Univ. Western Australia, Perth, Australia. INTRODUCTION: Most breast cancer patients are treated with adjuvant systemic therapy, often including chemotherapy.In younger women, chemotherapy for breast cancer may induce temporary amenorrhoea or permanent ovarian failure. For those making treatment decisions more information is needed about the potential impact of chemotherapy on vasomotor symptoms, sexual function and quality of life. The aim of this study was to compare these outcomes using validated instruments in a large clinic population of breast cancer survivors treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, compared to breast cancer survivors who had not received chemotherapy and also with women with no cancer history, controlled for current age, age at menopause, and current endocrine therapy. METHODS: Menopause clinic with dedicated service for breast cancer survivors based at a large tertiary women's hospital. Details of cancer treatment including adjuvant chemotherapy were recorded from medical records. Menopause symptoms were recorded with the Greene Climacteric Scale and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) -Breast Cancer (BC) and Endocrine Symptom (ES) Scales. Sexual symptoms were recorded using Fallowfield's Sexual Activity Questionnaire. Quality of life was measured with the FACT-BC, FACT-ES and FACT Social/Family Well-Being, Physical Well-Being, and Functional Well-Being subscales. RESULTS: The severity of vasomotor, psychological or sexual symptoms did not differ between breast cancer survivors who had received adjuvant chemotherapy (n=339) and other breast cancer survivors (n=465). However, severe pain with sexual intercourse was twice as common after chemotherapy (aOR 2.18, 95% CI 1.25-3.79) as among other breast cancer survivors. Vasomotor symptoms were more frequent (aOR 4.17, 95% CI 1.71-10.14) and severe (aOR 2.35, 95% CI 1.29-4.27) in breast cancer survivors compared to women without a cancer history. CONCLUSIONS: In this large study chemotherapy did not impact on nature or severity of vasomotor or psychological symptoms or quality of life. Pain with intercourse was more common in those treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Vasomotor symptoms were more severe in breast cancer patients compared to the non-cancer clinic population.Menopausal Symptoms in Younger Women (\u226440 Years) WithBreast Cancer. Michelle Peate, 1 Bettina Meiser, 2 Michael Friedlander, 2 Australian Fertility Decision Aid Collaborative Group, 2 Martha Hickey. 1 1 Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia; 2 Prince of Wales Clinical School, University of NSW, Kensington, NSW, Australia. INTRODUCTION:With 5 year survival at >89% in young women diagnosed with early breast cancer (BC), the impact of treatment on quality of life (QoL) is of growing importance. Around 80% of patients experience menopausal symptoms, and these may have substantial negative impact on their QoL. Little is known about the nature and severity of menopausal symptoms in BC patients diagnosed \u226440 years. Understanding the experience of this group is crucial for appropriate health care and followup. We report the nature and severity of menopausal symptoms and sexual function in a community based sample of 93 women \u226440 years diagnosed with early BC one year post-diagnosis following definitive BC treatment. METHODS: Recruited through 19 Australian oncology clinics, the Greene Climacteric Scale (psychological, somatic, vasomotor, and sexual interest domains) was used to measure menopausal symptoms.Higher scores indicate of more symptoms. Mean (m) domain scores were compared to women in the general population (various age groups), women attending a menopause clinic and women diagnosed with BC aged \u226464years, reported in the literature. Predictors of menopausal symptoms were explored. RESULTS: Compared to premenopausal women (m age =48.2), young BC patients (m age =33) had significantly more psychological (m=8.9 vs 5.7,p<.05) and vasomotor (m=1.8 vs 1.2,p<.05) and less sexual interest (m=1.2 vs 0.7,p<.05) symptoms. Sexual interest was also lower in young BC patients compared with women in the menopause transition (m age =50 years, <12 irregular menstruations in a year;m=1.2 vs 0.8,p<.05). Compared to women aged 40-50 years, young BC patients described more severe psychological symptoms (m=8.9 vs 7.4,p<.05), similar to those in women aged 50-64 years (m=8.9 vs 7.8,p<.05). In young BC patients, receiving combined adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy and endocrine therapy) was significantly associated with less interest in sex (F(1,91)=7.819,p=.0006). CONCLUSIONS: Young women with BC continue to experience vasomotor symptoms 12 months post-diagnosis, similar to women in spontaneous menopause transition but sexual interest is lower, particularly in those who have had both chemotherapy and endocrine therapy. Sexual dysfunction is a priority area for young BC patients and impacts negatively on QoL. This area should be addressed routinely in clinical follow-up.Comparison of Vitrified VersusFresh Donor Oocytes.

INTRODUCTION:Controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) traditionally has been started in the early follicular phase. COS initiated in the luteal phase has been proposed as a mechanism to expedite fertility preservation for women with cancer. Unfortunately, existing studies comparing outcomes of COS cycles initiated in the luteal phase to those of cycles initiated in the follicular phase are small and underpowered.

Brianna MW Lyttle, 1 Angela K Lawson, 2 Susan Klock, 3 Kristin Smith, 2 Ralph Kazer, 2 Jennifer Hirshfeld-Cytron, 2 Mary Ellen Pavone. 2 1 Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA, Canada; 2 Obstetrics and Gynecology, Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA; 3 Fertility Centers of Illinois, , Chicago, IL, USA. INTRODUCTION:Sleep disturbance is linked to stress and negative outcomes in chronic illnesses. Infertile patients are under significant stress and report sleep disturbances, but effects of sleep problems on IVF outcomes have not yet been studied. This is a pilot study to assess sleep patterns and medical outcomes in infertile compared to fertility preservation (FP) patients with a concurrent cancer diagnosis undergoing IVF. METHODS: 55 IVF and 32 FP patients completed a pre-IVF treatment sleep questionnaire(T1) of which 50 IVF and 32 FP patients also completed a post-treatment questionnaire at the time of retrieval(T2). Medical and stimulation information were collected. Sleep disturbance, medical diagnoses and IVF stimulation results were analyzed using Spearman correlations. RESULTS: At T1, FP patients had more sleep disturbance than IVF patients (p.<001). Between T1 and T2, IVF patients' sleep disturbance significantly increased (p<.009) but FP patients' sleep disturbance did not (p=.206). For both IVF and FP patients, no correlations were found between sleep disturbance and AMH at T1. At T2, no correlations were found between sleep disturbance and peak estradiol, total medication received, number of oocytes retrieved and number of oocytes frozen. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep scores for IVF patients significantly increased between T1 and T2, often reaching values equivalent to national levels cited for chronic illnesses. However, sleep disturbance did not correlate with total medication received, peak estradiol, or treatment-related outcomes. This suggests medications leading to alterations in hormone levels do not increase sleep disturbance. The increase in sleep disturbance between T1 and T2 in IVF patients may reflect the stress ART has on patients undergoing treatment.Reproductive Health DecisionsFollowing Breast Cancer Diagnosis. Kimberly K Ma, 1 Vijayakrishna K Gadi, 2 Courtney J Preusse, 2 Christopher I Li, 2 Jean A McDougall, 2 David Mahoney, 2 Hilary S Gammill. 1 1 Obstetrics and Gynecology, Univ. of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA; 2 Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.INTRODUCTION: Young women with breast cancer are often faced with opposing choices regarding preserving fertility and fulfilling childbearing desires when treating their malignancies. Decisions regarding reproductive choices vary considerably. We sought to ascertain utilization rates of oncofertility treatment in this population and hypothesized that parity at the time of cancer diagnosis would predict reproductive choices.RESULTS:Expression of both Ang II receptor was significantly high in dominant follicle and the distinction degree was larger in Ang II R-I compared to those of Ang II R-II between dominant and atresia in vitro matured mouse follicles. CONCLUSIONS: During in vitro maturation of mouse follicle, expression of Ang II receptor was related with selection of dominant follicle. This finding suggest that Ang II might be related to mechanism of dominant follicle selection during folliculogenesis (2013R1A1A2064077).Advanced Glycation End-Products and Vitamin D: Link BetweenDiet and PCOS? Zaher Merhi, 1 Frederick Naftolin, 1 Ahmed Fadiel, 1 Kendall Krebs, 2 Marilyn Cipolla. 2 1 Obstetrics and Gynecology, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; 2 Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington, VT, USA. INTRODUCTION:Women with PCOS commonly have elevated levels of the pro-inflammatory advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and low levels of vitamin D (VD). AGEs are highly reactive molecules that form when lipids or proteins become glycated after exposure to glucose. AGEs accumulate in the serum and ovaries of women with PCOS potentially altering ovarian function. Additionally, a high-AGE diet (like today's fast food) fed to animals induces metabolic and hormonal disturbances similar to those observed in PCOS. We have recently shown that VD induces a state of luteinization in human cumulus granulosa cells (GCs). We thus hypothesized that AGEs induce abnormal steroidogenesis and follicular development and that VD attenuates the AGE-induced ovarian dysfunction. METHODS: Experiment #1: Six women who underwent oocyte retrieval for IVF were enrolled. GCs were cultured in media (control) \u00b1 human glycated albumin (HGA) as a source of AGEs (0.2-0.4 mg/mL) \u00b1 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3; 50-100 nM) for 48 h after which mRNA was compared using RT-PCR for LHR, AMH and its receptor (AMHR-II), RAGE (pro-inflammatory membranous receptor for AGEs), and VD receptor (VDR). Experiment #2: The effect of AGEs in the presence or absence of VD3 on RAGE protein was assessed by immunofluorescence. GCs from 4 participants were treated with media (control) or HGA (0.4 mg/mL) \u00b1 VD3 (100 nM) for 48 h. Data were expressed as % change or median (range). RESULTS: Compared to controls, HGA significantly increased LHR (59%) and AMHR-II (52%) mRNA levels (p<0.05) but did not alter AMH or VDR mRNA levels. The addition of VD3 inhibited the HGA-induced upregulation in LHR and AMHR-II mRNA, and downregulated RAGE mRNA levels by 49% (p<0.05). Immunofluorescence showed that HGA increased RAGE protein levels by 20% and that the addition of VD3 significantly suppressed RAGE protein levels by 44% (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that AGEs alter genes involved in steroidogenesis (LHR) and follicular development (AMHR-II) in human GCs in a pattern similar to that observed in PCOS, where LHR and AMHR-II are known to be upregulated. VD3 suppressed RAGE levels and some of the actions of AGEs on GCs. These data provide a crucial missing piece in our understanding of the relationship between diet and ovulatory dysfunction in PCOS.A Novel Method for Detection of Prostaglandins in Human FollicularFluid. Bruce Pier, 1 Jonathon W Edmonds, 1 Ray Moore, 3 Jeevan Prasain, 3 Gordon W Bates, 1 Michael A Miller. 2 1 Div of REI, Dpt of OB/GYN, UABMC, Birmingham, AL, USA; 2 Dpt of Cell, Developmental and Integrative Biology, UAB, Birmingham, AL, USA; 3 Dpt of Pharm and Tox, UAB, Birmingham, AL, USA. INTRODUCTION: Prostaglandins (PG), vital for human ovulation and embryo implantation, have previously been measured in human follicular fluid (HFF) by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) is a sensitive and specific method for identifying PG, and may provide an opportunity to present a thorough understanding of the HFF PG content. Our group has used this method to detect novel PGs in C. elegans, which produces PGs independent of a cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme, and demonstrated a role for PGs in reproduction in C. elegans. Our primary aim was to detect PGs in HFF, and secondarily to detect if peaks consistent with COX-independent PG was present in HFF. METHODS: HFF was obtained from patients undergoing oocyte retrieval. Fluid from the first follicle entered on each side was separately collected from each patient. PG extraction was performed on 12 HFF samples. A dueterated standard was added to each sample prior to PG extraction. For PG extraction, a modified liquid-liquid extraction method was used. Extraction efficiency was 70%. LC-MS/MS operated in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode provided PG detection and quantification. PG's were quantified using known concentrations of standard PGs. RESULTS: Varying levels of PGF-2\u03b1, PGF-1\u03b1, and PGE2 were detected in all samples. Detection of PGE1 and 6-keto PGF-1\u03b1 did not occur in all samples. PG concentrations are shown inTable 1. The stereoisomers 8-epi-PGF-2\u03b1 and/or co-eluting 8-epi-15(R) are also commonly detected in our samples. Varying expression of peaks consistent with COX-independent PG were detected as well.CONCLUSIONS: LC-MS/MS provides a novel method for detecting PG. Operated in MRM, LC-MS/MS has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting known PG, and all isomers for the PG in question. We have detected peaks consistent with known PG, as well as COX-independent PG, in HFF. Further research is needed to understand the importance of these findings, to establish a normal PG profile in a fertile population, and to compare a normal profile to subfertile groups to gain insight for the etiology of these subtypes.The Interleukin 11 Gene in OvarianFailure Associated Region 19q13.42 Is Highly Conserved in Women With Premature Ovarian Failure (POF). Robert T Rydze, Ekrem M Bilgin, William E Gibbons, Ertug Kovanci. Obstetrics and Gynecology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA. INTRODUCTION: Genome-wide association studies have identified genetic loci in 19q13.42 region associated with age at natural menopause (ANM) and POF. IL-11 is located in this region of interest and plays a role in immune regulation, specifically in T-cell-dependent development of immunoglobulin-producing B cells.Previous studies have demonstrated that alterations in auto-immune pathways may play a role in ANM and POF. We hypothesized that variations in SNPs within IL-11 may be present in different frequencies in women with POF as compared to the general population. METHODS: We collected genomic DNA from predominantly North American Caucasian women with POF defined as amenorrhea prior to age 40 with elevated FSH >20 IU/L. Primer sets specific for all 5 exons of IL-11 were designed for polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR products were then sequenced using a commercial ABI3730XL Sanger sequencing platform and systematically compared to the human genome database sequence (Ensembl 2014) using Sequencher v5.1 (Gene Codes Corp, Ann Arbor, MI). Electropherograms were manually examined to identify sequence variants. We used 'Sorting Tolerant From Intolerant' (SIFT) and PolyPhen2 software to predict the effect of non-synonymous variants on protein function. RESULTS: In 70 women with POF, we detected one single nucleotide variant (c.98G>A rs4252548) that was predicted to be potentially damaging based on both computational protein function models. However, only one woman with POF demonstrated this variant and the minor allele frequency (MAF) in our cohort was similar to that previously reported in the 1000 Genomes project. No other novel SNPs were identified in any of the exons of IL-11. CONCLUSIONS: All 5 exons of IL-11 are highly conserved in our study population. Therefore, IL-11 mutations are not a common cause of sporadic POF in Caucasians. Our study eliminates another gene in 19q13.42 as a candidate for POF.High Fat Diet Is Associated With Decreased Ovarian ReserveIrrespective of Obese Phenotype. Malgorzata E Skaznik-Wikiel, Jennifer Monks, Elise S Bales, Alex J Polotsky, James L McManaman. Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO, USA. INTRODUCTION: Obesity is associated with decreased ovarian reserve and impaired reproduction. However, it is unclear if these effects are due to adiposity per se or to high dietary fats. We sought to determine the relative effects of high fat feeding versus obesity on ovarian reserve in mice. METHODS: Sexually mature 9 wk old C57BL/6 mice were assigned to receive different dietary interventions for 8 weeks. Group I (n=3) received low fat diet (LFD) including 10% of calories coming from fat resulting in lean phenotype (LF-Ln). Group II (n=3) was fed high fat diet (HFD) with 60% of calories coming from fat resulting in obesity (HF-Ob). Group III (n=4) was fed HFD resulting in lean phenotype (HF-Ln). Ovaries were collected after 8 weeks of dietary exposure for assessment of resting (primordial) and growing (primary, secondary, antral) follicle numbers. Animal weights were recorded and percentage of body fat was measured using whole-body MRI at the time of ovary collection. Student t-test and one-way ANOVA were used as appropriate (GraphPad Prism 6).RESULTS:The average weights of the animals in LF-Ln, HF-Ob, and HF-Ln groups were 20.5\u00b10.5g, 27.3\u00b11.5g, and 21.7\u00b11.2g, respectively. Respective mean fat mass values for each group were 14.2\u00b13.1%, 26.2\u00b12.6%, and 16.7\u00b15.4%. While HF-Ob group had significantly higher adiposity, the mean body weight and fat mass were not statistically different between LF-Ln and HF-Ln group (p=0.13). Based on dietary intervention, primordial follicle numbers were 928\u00b139 in LFD mice and 445\u00b178 in HFD mice (p=0.005). Exposure to HFD resulted in decreased ovarian reserve (depleted primordial follicles) irrespective of obese phenotype. Primordial follicle numbers were 577\u00b1114 in HF-Ob and 346\u00b184 in HF-Ln animals compared to 928\u00b139 in LF-Ln mice (p=0.006). *Figure(s) will be available online. Numbers of primary, secondary, and antral follicles did not differ significantly between the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: HFD results in decreased ovarian reserve, irrespective of obesity. Our findings support the notion that high fat diet could play a role in the causal link between obesity and impaired reproduction.NKT-Activation Alters the Maternal T-Cell Repertoire and CausesPreterm Birth.

IVF Unit and Laboratory for ReproductiveImmunology, Hillel Yaffe  Medical Center, Technion -Israel Institute of Technology, Hadera, NA,  Israel.   INTRODUCTION: Myeloid cell populations have been shown to play role in angiogenesis. For example, immature myeloid cells (IMCs) that differentiate into granulocytes, monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), promote angiogenesis in malignancies but also in the placenta. We tested whether placental development is accompanied by alterations in myeloid cell populations and whether preeclampsia is associated with aberrations in their presence. METHODS: Mouse experiments: placentas were harvested from pregnancies of C57Bl/6 and Cx3CR1 GFP/+ mice. Human experiments: placentas were obtained from normal vaginal deliveries (NVD) and from elective cesarean-sections (CS) or from pregnancies with preeclampsia. Placentas were immunostained and analysed using flow cytometry. Immunohistochemistry was performed on frozen sections. RESULTS: The percentage of CD11b high CX3CR1GFPneutrophils of total CD45 + cells in mouse placentas peaked before labor (28.3\u00b17.9%, 17.6\u00b19.3%, 30.4\u00b12.3% on days 12,15,19 ;n=25, p=0.006). Conversely, both CD11b + CX3CR1GFP int monocytes and CD11b + CX3CR1GFP high macrophages decreased throughout pregnancy (21.5\u00b15.3%, 16.7\u00b13.6%, 10.6\u00b13.4% and 6.4\u00b12.4%, 4.4 \u00b12.9 % 1.8\u00b10.4%;n=25, p=0.001, p=0.035). CD11b + Gr1 + IMCs decreased throughout the latter part of pregnancy (29\u00b19.1%, 30\u00b19.9% ,21\u00b18.1%; n=63, P=0.004) while CD11c + MHCII + DCs increased before labor (0.87\u00b10.3% ,0.7\u00b10.3%, 1.81\u00b11.3%; n=63, P=0.001). In placenta tissue sections IMCs and not DCs located adjacent to CD31 + endothelial cells lining blood vessels. Similarly, the CD11c + HLADR + DC population was higher in human placentas from NVD compared to CS (6.7\u00b13.36% vs. 4.7\u00b11.98%, n=41, P=0.03). The CD45 + lin2 -CD33 + HLADR -IMC population in placentas from patients with preeclampsia was higher compared to those obtained from healthy controls (17.7\u00b17.35% vs. 9.4\u00b13.8%, n=14, P=0.018). CONCLUSIONS: In mouse placentas monocytes, macrophages and IMCs decrease throughout pregnancy paralleling a reciprocal increase in neutrophils and DCs. This accords with proangiogenic properties of the former-and proinflammatory properties of the latter populations. In line with mouse data, human placental DCs increased in labor (NVD) as compared with the absence of labor (CS). In preeclampsia the increase in IMCs may result from placental hypoxia and the need for increased angiogenesis.Prenatal Stress Over Generations Disrupts the T-Cell Repertoire inMothers and Neonates. Amy-Eunice Furcron, 1 Tara N Mial, 1 Marcia Arenas-Hernandez, 1 Roberto Romero, 2 Sonia S Hassan, 1,2 Nardhy Gomez-Lopez. 1,2 1 OB/GYN, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA;  2 Perinatology Research Branch, NICHD/NIH, Detroit/Bethesda, MI/  MD, USA.   INTRODUCTION: Prenatal stress is associated with maternal and neonatal adverse events. Our preliminary data demonstrate that prenatal stress over 2-3 generations shortens gestational length, reduces neonatal weight, and increases the rate of neonatal and infant mortality(Furcron  et al, unpublished data). A breakdown of the maternal and neonatal immune systems may be associated with these events. We hypothesized that prenatal stress over 2-3 generations disrupts the T-cell repertoire in mothers and their neonates. METHODS: B6 dams were stressed over 3 generations: F0S, F1SS, and F2SSS. F1SS, F2SSS, and control (non-stressed) dams (n=5-7)",

INTRODUCTION: Spontaneous abortion (SA) complicates 5 -10% of pregnancies. Previous results suggest that macrophages (MFs) play a pivotal role during the pathogenesis of SA by polarizing to an M1 subtype under the influence of first trimester decidual cells (FTDCs). Mf polarization is regulated by histone modification at the promoter of marker genes. Interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) is suggested to play a role in M\u03a6 differentiation via epigenetic mechanisms. Like histone lysine methylation, methylation of histone arginine residues can also regulate transcription with protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) playing a crucial role in this process. However, the role of PRMT5 and IRF7 in M\u03a6 polarization has not been demonstrated. Thus, we hypothesize that FTDCs direct M\u03a6 polarization via PRMT5 and IRF-associated epigenetic regulation. METHODS: FTDCs were primed with estradiol (10 -8 M) + medroxyprogesterone acetate (10 -7 M) for 7d followed by adding 1 ng/ml of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) or tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). Peripheral monocytes (MOs) were then incubated with conditioned media (CM) from FTDC cultures for 5d. IRF7 expression by MFs was assessed by qRT-PCR and by Western blotting. In parallel experiments, MOs were also treated with M1 stimuli using recombinant human granulocyte M\u03a6-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF; 50 ng/mL) for 5d followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 ng/mL) and interferon-\u03b3(IFN-\u03b3; 20 ng/mL) \u00b1 a PRMT5 inhibitor, compound 5 (CMP5) for 24h. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay examined the presence of PRMT5 in IRF7 promoter. The expression of PRMT5 and IRF7 in MFs was evaluated using qRT-PCR and Western blotting. RESULTS: qRT-PCR and Western blot consistently showed an increase of IRF7 in MOs cultured with CM from IL-1\u03b2-or TNF-\u03b1-treated FTDCs. M1 stimuli increased PRMT5 recruitment to IRF7 promoter by 3.45-fold. PRMT5 and IRF7 expression was induced by M1 stimuli by 4.16-and 10.43-fold, respectively. The induction of IRF7 expression in MFs was inhibited by CMP5. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that PRMT5 is involved in the regulation of IRF7 which is associated with FTDC-induced M1 M\u03a6 polarization.Longitudinal Changes in Dendritic Cells Response To Toll-Like Receptor Stimulation in Uncomplicated Pregnancy andPostpartum.

INTRODUCTION: Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles released by cells, which contain microRNAs(miRNAs). During gestation, the placenta releases large quantities of exosomes into the maternal circulation. We hypothesized that placentally-derived exosomes aid establishment of maternal-fetal tolerance and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) amelioration in pregnancy via miRNA transfer to immune cells. To facilitate mechanistic studies in mice, the first goal was to determine the miRNA profiles of trophoblast and pregnancy-associated exosomes. METHODS: Next-generation RNA-sequencing was used to identify miRNAs contained in exosomes derived from undifferentiated murine trophoblast stem cells (TSC), TSC cells differentiated to syncytium (SynT), as well as nonpregnant (NP) and 14.5 day pregnant (GD14.5) B6 mice, n=3 per group. Selected miRNAs were further investigated by qRT-PCR from TSC and SynT (n=5) and NP and GD14.5 (n=8) exosomes. RESULTS: Four miRNAs were differentially abundant (increased: miR-322, miR-450a; decreased: miR-5099, miR-1198) in SynT compared to TSC exosomes (p<0.05). qRT-PCR revealed miR-322 enrichment in both pregnancy (322-3p, p=0.0004; 322-5p, p=0.001) and SynT differentiation (322-3p, p=0.0093; 322-5p, p=0.0004). Interestingly, three additional microRNAs (503-5p, 542-3p, 450a-5p) that cluster with miRNA-322 were also increased with SynT differentiation (p=0.0485, p=0.0012, and p<0.0001); 503-5p also increased with pregnancy (p=0.0014). Exosomal miR-292-3p was detected by RNA-sequencing in GD14.5 but not in NP exosomes, and by qRT-PCR miRNA-292-3p increased with pregnancy (p=0.0035). CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy-associated and trophoblast exosomes contain a cluster of miRNAs around miR-322, which is known to be abundant in mouse placenta. The human ortholog of miR-322, hsa-miR-424, is known to increase with primary human trophoblast syncytialization. Gene targets of hsa-miR-424 (FGFR1, CUL2), hsa-miR-503 (FGF2) and mmu-miR-292 (DKK1) have been implicated in immune modulation and RA. Future studies will address functional and immunologic consequences of these syncytial and pregnancy-associated exosomal miRNAs.Funding: ACR (LLD), CTSA TL1 TR000155 (ALS), T32 HD07186 (AH), UC SOM (VDW, LLD) Effect of Heme Oxygenase-1 on the immunosuppressive Function of DecIdual Myeloid Cells. Hui Zhao, Flora Kalish, Ronald J Wong, David K Stevenson. Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA. INTRODUCTION: Myeloid cells, such as macrophages (M\u03a6), dendritic cells (DCs) and neutrophils, infiltrate into the decidua in early pregnancy and promote immunotolerance to support placental and fetal development. Myeloid subtypes with suppressive properties [alternatively-activated M\u03a6 (M2s), tolerogenic DCs (tDCs), and myeloid derived suppressive cells (MDSCs)], have been identified in human and mouse deciduae. The stress-response protein, heme oxygenase-1(HO-1), has anti-inflammatory functions, can facilitate immunotolerance in organ transplantation, and is highly expressed in the decidua. A deficiency in HO-1 is associated with spontaneous abortions. Since HO-1 is involved in the polarization of M2s and tolerogenicity of DCs, we hypothesize that HO-1 may also regulate immunosuppressive functions of decidual myeloid cells. METHODS: Deciduae were collected at E8.5, 9.5, and 10.5 from timed pregnancies of wild-type (WT) FVB or HO-1 deficient (HO-1 +/-, Het) breeding pairs. Gene expression profiles of ~17 cytokines/chemokines were measured by PCR arrays and compared between WT and Het deciduae. Single cell suspensions from deciduae were stained with antibodies for surface or intracellular markers. Flow cytometry was used to analyse myeloid cell types: infiltrating M\u03a6 (CD11b hi Ly6C hi ), DCs (CD11b hi CD11c + ), neutrophils (CD11b hi Ly6-G hi ), residential M\u03a6 (CD11b mid F4/80 + ), uterine natural killer (uNK) cells (DBA + ), etc. M2s or tDCs were also characterized. HO-1 levels were assessed by intracellular staining. RESULTS: At E10.5, mRNA levels of chemokines (Ccl1, Ccl6, Ccl11, Ccl12, Cxcl4, Cxcl9, Cxcl12), interleukins (Il-6, Il15, Il-16 and Il-17b), receptors (Ccr1, Ccr2, Ccr3, Ccr5, Il1r1), and myeloid pan-marker CD11b were significantly reduced in HO-1 Het deciduae. HO-1 was primarily expressed in infiltrating myeloid cells and low in uNK cells and residential M\u03a6. In WT deciduae, 50% of CD11b mid F4/80 + M\u03a6 were CD206 + M2s; while the majority of CD11C + DCs were CD80 -CD86 -MHCii -tDCs. Compared to WT deciduae, uNK cells and neutrophils/MDSCs were significantly less in HO-1 Het deciduae at E9.5. Also, without any change in the total DC population, the percentage of tDCs was significantly reduced in Het deciduae at E9.5 and E10.5. CONCLUSIONS: A deficiency in maternal HO-1 expression results in significant alterations in cytokines/chemokines production and composition of immunosuppressive myeloid subtypes in deciduae and, therefore may affect immunotolerance during early pregnancy.B Cell Autorreactivity Potential Is Repressed During HumanPregnancy.Katharina Ziegler, Damian Muzzio, Imke Bommer, Franziska  Matzner, Kristin Malinowsky, Marek Zygmunt, Federico Jensen. Research  Laboratory: Obstetrics and Gynecology, Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Greifswald,  Greifswald, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany.   INTRODUCTION: B lymphocytes are pleiotropic cells belonging to the adaptive arm of the immune system. Although B cells were classically regarded for their capacity to produce antibodies, in the recent years, several other functions were attributed to these cells. Two major B cell subpopulations B1 and B2 have been described. The human B2 cells develop postnatally from hematopoietic precursor cells in the bone marrow to pro-B cells, pre-B cells to immature B cells, which can egress into the blood circulation. Unlike B2, the B1 cells develop in the fetal liver and are maintained in the adult life by self-replenishment. Whereas B1 CD11bcells subpopulation is a major source antibodies, CD11b + B1 B cells secrete significant amounts of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10, involved in the process of pregnancy tolerance. In this study the expression of different populations of B cells was examined in pregnant and non-pregnant women. METHODS: 124 women were included in our cross-sectional study. They were assigned to five groups: non-pregnant, 1st, 2nd, 3rd trimester and postpartum. Isolated PBMCs were stained for extra-and intracellular markers and analyzed by flow cytometry. FlowJo software was used for analysis. Statistical significance was assessed by the nonparametric Oneway ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis Test. RESULTS: Our data shows an accumulation of early pro-pre B cells (CD24 bright CD38 bright CD10 + IgM -)in peripheral blood of pregnant women in first trimester as compared to non-pregnant age-matched control women. Further analysis depicted a statistical significant decrease of the higher differentiated immature B cells (CD24 bright CD38 bright CD10 low IgM + ) in pregnant women in second trimester compared to non-pregnant women.",

Liping Feng, 1 Terrence K Allen, 2 Amy P Murtha. 1 1 OB-GYN, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA;  2 Anesthesiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.   INTRODUCTION: The chorioamnion is vulnerable to oxidative stress (OS). OS mediated telomere shortening (cell aging or cellular senescence marker) in the fetal membranes is a normal physiologic process leading to term delivery, but is activated prematurely in preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). We also demonstrated that chorion cell death and extracellular matrix degradation resulted in chorion layer thinning in PPROM. Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) and Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) deacetylate several proteins that promote resistance to OS and DNA damage. Progestins protect cytotrophoblast cells (lack of nuclear progesterone receptors) from cell death likely mediated through progesterone membrane component 1 (PGRMC1) (our published data). Therefore, we aim to investigate the role of progesterone and PGRMC1 in the regulation of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in chorion cells in the setting of OS (H 2 O 2 exposure). METHODS: Primary chorion cells were treated with H 2 O 2 at 100, 300, 500\u00b5M for 4h and 24h with or without pretreatment with P4 or Ethanol (vehicle) at a dose of 10 -7 M for 1h. Cell lysates were harvested for Western blotting to determine SIRT1 and SIRT3 expressions. To examine the role of PGRMC1, primary chorion cells were treated the same way mentioned above after knock down PGRMC1 using specific siRNA. Cell lysates were harvested for Western blotting to determine knockdown of PGRMC1 expression and SIRT1 and SIRT3 expressions. GAPDH was used as internal control. Experiments are replicated using fetal membrane tissues from 7 subjects. RESULTS: H 2 O 2 significantly down-regulated SIRT3 protein expression (but not SIRT1) in a dose and time dependent manner. The downregulation of SIRT3 by H 2 O 2 was inhibited by P4 pretreatment. The down-regulation of SIRT1 and SIRT3 by H 2 O 2 was significantly increased in PGRMC1 knock down cells compared to wild type control cells. However, the inhibition of SIRT down-regulation by P4 pretreatment was not significantly different in PGRMC1 knock down cells and control cells. Thus the P4 effect in this process does not solely depend on PGRMC1. CONCLUSIONS: SIRTs are important in the physiologic process of cell aging. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of P4 and PGRMC1 in SIRT regulation in chorion cells under OS. In a broader view, the involvement of PGRMC1 in SIRT regulation is novel and can be critical for other OS and aging related disease conditions.Biomechanical Simulations of Pregnancy: The Effects of Collagen Stiffness and Membrane Adhesion on Cervical Deformation andShortening.

INTRODUCTION: The biomechanical factors leading to a short cervix cannot be accurately studied in pregnant patients. Mechanical simulations such as the finite element (FE) method are well suited to study these factors. We hypothesized that three factors have an important impact on cervical shortening: cervical collagen properties, fetal membrane adhesion, and intrauterine pressure (IUP). We built a FE model to test this hypothesis by varying one model parameter at a time and simulating mechanical loads from IUP. METHODS: Two patients were recruited: 32 y/o P0 at 28 weeks with normal cervical length and 25 y/o P2 at 22 weeks with a short cervix.",

Department ofObstetrics and  Gynecology, Univ Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA.   INTRODUCTION: The molecular mechanisms by which PGE2 induces cervical ripening are not known. Previously, we have shown that, in human cervical stromal cells (hCSCs), PGE2 acts through EP2 receptors to downregulate its own inactivating enzyme, 15-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH). Further, in a positive feedback mechanism, PGE2 induced COX-2 and prostaglandin-E synthase (PGES). Here, we sought to decipher molecular mechanisms of PGE2-mediated gene regulation of signature molecules involved in cervical ripening and possible interventions for premature cervical ripening and dilation. METHODS: Next Generation RNA sequencing, microarray analysis, qPCR and immunoblotting and were conducted in human cervical tissues and stromal cells in culture. RESULTS: EP2 antagonists (2 \u00b5M, PF-04418948, TG4-155 and TG8-4) blocked PGE2-mediated downregulation of 15-PGDH in hCSC. Although cAMP-independent, PGE 2 increased [Ca 2+ ] i and its repressive effects on 15-PGDH were rescued by the Ca 2+ chelating agent BAPTA-AM in the absence of extracellular Ca 2+ . The serine/threonine protein phosphatase inhibitor (okadaic acid, 100 nM) blocked PGE2-mediated effects whereas a phosphatase activator C2-ceramide (50 \u00b5M) and Ca 2+ /Calmodulin Kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitors (KN-62 and KN-93, 5 \u00b5M) mimicked PGE2 effects. HDAC inhibitors not only induced basal levels of 15-PGDH and repressed basal COX-2 and IL-8, HDACi also antagonized PGE2-mediated effects. Importantly, HDACi blocked PGE2-mediated induction of AP1 (c-jun and c-fos), a primary activator of COX-2 and IL-8 gene expression. A comparison of gene expression data generated by RNAseq from hCSC treated with PGE2 for 1 or 24 h with microarray data from human cervical stromal tissues (not ripe vs ripe/dilated) revealed 253 genes as potential PGE2 targets involved in cervical ripening. Transcripts encoding dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) increased >30-fold. Inhibition of DUSP1/2 completely blocked PGE2-induced downregulation of PGDH. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data suggest that PGE2-mediated activation of cervical EP2 receptor leads to increases in [Ca 2+ ] i which then activate a Ca 2+ -dependent phosphatase (DUSP1) to dephosphorylate inactive cytoplasmic HDACs for transport to the nucleus and recruited to target genes for repression (including 15-PGDH and cfos/cjun). Our results clearly suggest that pharmacological agents with EP2 antagonistic and HDAC inhibitory activity may be lead molecules to prevent premature cervical ripening and preterm birth.Development of an Immortalized Human Cervical Stromal FibroblastCell Line (hTERT CX Cells) and Characterization of Steroid Hormone Receptor Expression.

INTRODUCTION:There is no known animal model of human fetal membrane (FM) weakening. Inflammation/infection and abruption/ thrombin are leading causes of pPROM related preterm birth. Utilizing our enhanced in-vitro model of human FM weakening process, we have recently demonstrated that Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a critical overlapping mediator of both tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and thrombin induced FM weakening. GM-CSF may act like a paracrine effector on monocyte/macrophages to generate proteases that remodel and weaken the FM. The amnion in particular must be weakened in order for FM to rupture. METHODS: We initially co-localized GM-CSF activity and macrophages to weaker areas of the FM. FM from patients (n=3) with term uncomplicated pregnancies were obtained following elective scheduled cesarean and strength tested according to our published methodology. Expression of GM-CSF receptor (GM-CSFR\u03b1) and macrophage marker (Integrin aX) using western blots were compared in strong versus relatively much weaker FM areas. Separately we examined the ability of activated monocytes/macrophages to weaken the amnion. Amnion tissue alone (instead of full thickness FM) was mounted on our model system. Immortalized THP-1 monocytes obtained from the ATCC with and without preincubation with Phobol ester (to transform them into activated macrophages) were incubated (3 d) with the amnion. Strength testing was then accomplished. RESULTS: GM-CSFR\u03b1 and Integrin aX expression are co-localized and concurrently increased in weak versus strong FM areas. *Figure(s) will be available online. Compared to undifferentiated monocytes (controls) differentiated monocytes (PMA-pretreated THP-1 cells-ATCC) induced significant amnion weakening (11.3\u00b10.96 Newtons versus 4.17\u00b11.82 respectively; p=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: GM-CSF receptor and macrophage marker are upregulated in weaker areas of FM. Activated monocytes weaken FM in-vitro presumably through protease production.

YoshimitsuKuwabara, 1 Akira Katayama, 2 Yosuke Sugita, 1 Yuka Shirai, 1 Kimihiko Nakao, 1 Mirei Yonezawa, 1 Nozomi Ouchi, 1 Rintaro Sawa, 1 Toshiyuki Takeshita. 1 1 Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan; 2 Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan. INTRODUCTION: Recently, progesterone supplementation has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of preterm birth, especially when administered via a vaginal suppository. However, the direct effect of progesterone on uterine cervical remodeling has yet to be clarified. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of P4 on the gene expression profile of molecules associated with the pathophysiology of preterm labor, using human uterine cervical fibroblasts (UCFs) treated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS). METHODS: Human uterine cervical tissue was obtained at term, prior to the onset of labor, during a scheduled cesarean section. Primary UCF cultures were established. UCFs were incubated, with or without lipopolysaccharides (LPS; 2.0 mg/mL), in the presence or absence of P4 (1.0 \u00b5M), for 12 h (n=3). Cellular mRNA was extracted and subjected to real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses, to assess the gene expression pattern of molecules known to be associated with the pathophysiology of preterm labor. These molecules included the cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1\u03b2; the enzyme prostaglandinendoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2); and several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). RESULTS: According to the real-time RT-PCR analyses, LPS stimulation induced a significant increase in the transcription level of all molecules assessed (IL-1\u03b2, p<0.0005; PTGS2, p<0.0005; IL6, p<0.005; IL8, p<0.001; MMP-1, p<0.005; MMP-2, p<0.05; MMP-3, p<0.001; MMP-9, p<0.05; MMP-10, p<0.005). With the exception of IL6 and IL8, P4 treatment attenuated the LPS-induced increase in transcription level of all molecules assessed; this attenuation was significant (IL-1\u03b2, p<0.05; PTGS2, p<0.005; MMP-1, p<0.05; MMP-2, p<0.005; MMP-3, p<0.05; MMP-9, p<0.05; MMP-10, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results suggest that an elevation of the local concentration of P4 by use of a vaginal suppository might prevent spontaneous preterm labor by inhibiting cervical remodeling, particularly through the attenuation of ECM degradation by inhibition of MMPs production. Because P4 treatment does not suppress the LPSinduced expression of IL-8 and IL-6, any anti-inflammatory effect of P4 seems to be limited.Oestradiol Modulates Expression Levels of Toll-Like Receptor 2 and 4 in Human EctocervicalEpithelial Cells. Behnia S Lashkari, Dilly OC Anumba. Academic Unit of Reproductive and Developmental Medicine, Department of Human Metabolism, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, South Yorkshire, United Kingdom. INTRODUCTION:Having demonstrated that cervical toll-like receptors (TLR) 2&4 are upregulated during pregnancy, we sought to determine whether oestradiol (E 2 ) alters the TLR 2&4 expression levels in cultured primary human ecto-cervical epithelial cells (HECECs). Primary cells offer better insight into cell physiology than tumour-derived immortalised cell lines but are difficult to culture. METHODS: Fresh ectocervical tissues were collected following hysterectomy from women of child-bearing age with dysfunctional uterine bleeding. The epithelia were isolated and cultured after digestion by collagenase and trypsin. The purity of the cultured HECECs was validated by immunofluorescence. The expression of TLR2, TLR4 and oestrogen receptors (ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2) proteins and genes were demonstrated by flow cytometry and RT-PCR. HECECs were co-incubated with varying E 2 concentrations (0.1, 1, 10, 100 nM) for 10 minutes, two and 18 hours. TLR2 and TLR4 expression were assessed in the HECECs after the incubation period using flow cytometry. The percentage of parent gate was applied for detection of TLR 2&4 signals. GraphPad Prism v6.0f was used for statistical evaluations while ANOVA model and Bartlett's test was used for the statistical comparisons. The P-value < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: In response to incubation with variant E 2 concentrations, TLR2 and TLR4 expression levels in the cultured HECECs decreased significantly at 10 minutes time duration compared to the absence of E 2 . No significant alterations were detected in the TLR2 and TLR4 expression levels in the HECECs co-incubated with different concentrations of E 2 at two and 18 hour time durations. However TLR4 expression level declined only with E 2 100nM at 2-hour incubation of HECECs.",

Manuel E Rivera-Alsina, Jessica Prussa Flores, Leora Cavazos. Division of Maternal Fetal Medicine, Methodist Health System, Dallas, TX, USA. INTRODUCTION: Fetal Ultrasound(FU)  has been with us since 1960. From a small biometry beginnings to new high tech studies, FU has changed the way we provide care to our pregnant patient. Pre term birth is the leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Cervical Length Measurement (CLM) has been used to assign risk of preterm labor & delivery. There is controversy around the routine assessment of CLM as the mean of defining risk in low risk women. There is also solid data that CLM will help with therapeutic interventions that will reduce the prevalence of preterm labor & delivery. Utilizing CLEAR Criteria we compared CLM referred from our General Obstetricians to our Center for Maternal Fetal Medicine. The objective of this study was to compare the concordance of measurements in the referring physician office versus measurements in the Center for Maternal Fetal Medicine.Cervical length is most accurately measured by Trans Vaginal ultrasound examination. In our center we use the CLEAR Criteria (Cervical Length Education and Review) to measure cervical length. Based on training provided by the Perinatal Quality Foundation it gives specific guidelines for the measurements, and has been approved by AIUM, SMFM, ACOG and SDMS. These guidelines include: Image Criteria-Trans vaginal image, Cervix occupies 75% of image, Anterior width equals Posterior width. In addition: Maternal bladder should be empty, Internal os seen, External os seen, Cervical canal visible throughout, Caliper placement correct, and Cervical mobility considered METHODS: All referrals for short cervix (CLM) were reviewed and measured utilizing CLEAR Criteria for the last 12 months. In addition to CLM we collected clinical data related to demographics and prior obstetrical history. RESULTS: A total of 34 patients (n=34) were included in the pilot study. Nine (9) referred patient met the CLEAR Criteria (26.5%). Twenty five (25) patients did not meet CLEAR Criteria (73.5%). CONCLUSIONS: 73.5% of all referrals did not meet CLEAR Criteria for short CLM. 26.5% of patient met CLEAR Criteria for short CLM. Careful review and examination of all referred cases is warranted in order to avoid classifying low risk women in the high risk group with the possible use of therapeutic actions not needed.Outcomes of Transabdominal Cerclage in Twin PregnanciesCompared To Singleton Pregnancies. Gahyun Son, Keunyoung Lee, Jieun Song, Kyliehaejin Chang. Obstetrics and Gynecology, Hallym University College of Medicine, Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital, Seoul, NA, Korea. INTRODUCTION:To compare outcomes of transabdominal cervicoisthmic cerclage in women with twin gestaions to those with singleton gestations and to identify whether risk factors for extremely preterm birth (< 28 weeks) differ between these two groups. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of women who underwent a transabdominal cervicoisthmic cerclage from Feb 2007 to Apr 2013. We performed transabdominal cervicoisthmic cerclage on patients with prior failed transvaginal cerclage history or with short and severely deformative cervix during first trimester. Differences in characteristics and outcomes were compared between women with twin and singleton gestations. A multivariable analysis was performed to examine whether twin gestation was independently associated with delivery before 28 weeks. RESULTS: Of the 142 women who underwent a cerclage, twenty one (14.8%) had twin pregnancies. Mean gestational age and ultrasonographic cervical length at placement did not differ. Although twins were more likely to deliver at a earlier median gestation than singletons (35.3 weeks; interquartile range, 33.1-37.6 vs 37.5 weeks ; interquartile rane, 35.2-39.4 ; p=0.015), the frequency of delivery before 28 weeks did not differ between these two groups (14.3% vs 11.8%, p=0.69). Shorter cervical length and prior preterm birth history were identified as risk factors for birth < 28 weeks in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Transabdominal cervicoisthmic cerclage can be also accomplished safely in patients with twin gestation having risk factors of preterm birth. Women with a twin pregnancy who received a transabdominal cerclage had similar risk factors for extreme preterm birth as women with singleton gestations.Assessing the Risk of Spontaneous Premature Birth By ElectricalImpedance Spectroscopy of the Cervix: The ECCLIPPx Study. Victoria Stern, 1 Jamie Healey, 2 Brian Brown, 3 Dilly Anumba. 1 1 AUDRM, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom; 2 Dept of Clinical Engineering, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, United Kingdom; 3 Dept of Cardiovascular Science, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom. INTRODUCTION: Existing tests for the prediction of preterm birth (PTB) are suboptimal. Electrical impedance spectroscopy(EIS)provides objective information about the composition of the cervix. A prospective cohort study, funded by the MRC DPFS scheme has commenced in Sheffield to assess its potential predictive utility for PTB. METHODS: Employing an optimised prototype, 250 women at high risk of PTB will undergo EIS readings at 20-22 and 26-28 weeks; 250 low risk women once at 20-22 weeks; and 100 symptomatic women on admission to hospital. To determine whether cervical impedance (CI) could prove a platform technique for other tests/treatments within existing PTB care pathways, we will also assess fetal fibronectin (FFN), cervical length (CL) and vaginal pH. RESULTS: 49 participants have delivered to date, with 12 preterm and 37 term births. A significant difference in CL between term and preterm groups is evident (mean CL 35.8 vs 28.6mm, p=0.029), but as yet no differences in FFN (12 vs 9 ng/ml, p=0.22) or pH (4.0 vs 4.1, p=0.07) have been observed. *Figure(s) will be available online.",

INTRODUCTION:The endocervix has both anatomical and biological functions that participate in the delicate balance between tolerance necessary for conception and protection from pathogens. Our goal was to develop a robust three-dimensional (3D) endocervix model that was a reliable representation of the in vivo tissues and to identify the physiological responses to changing levels of steroid hormones during a 28-day time period. METHODS: Human endocervical cells were grown on polystyrene scaffolds and the morphologic and hormonal responses of cultured cells were assessed in response to fluctuating levels of estradiol (E2) or progesterone (P4). RESULTS: Morphologically, the 3D cultures were composed of a mixed population of cells including epithelial and stromal cells. Treatment with E2 and P4 (day-28) increased cell growth and proliferation as compared to no treatment control. Cells expressed estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) and produced both neutral and acidic mucins, including MUC16. In addition, a 45-plex Luminex assay identified numerous factors secreted and regulated by hormones. Specifically, Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) and Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) significantly decreased in the presence of E2 and P4 as compared to the no hormone control at day-26. Co-treatment with RU486 attenuated the progesterone-driven inhibition of IL-1\u03b2 and LIF secretion. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, a robust, novel 3D endocervical culture was developed and physiologic responses to the menstrual cycle mimic of estradiol and progesterone levels for a period of 28 days were identified.Re-Examining the Importance of Vasopressin Receptors inMyometrial Contraction. Sarah Arrowsmith, 1 Susan Wray, 1 Markus Muttenthaler. 2 1 Dept. of Cellular and Molecular Physiology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom; 2 Dept. of Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, The Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Barcelona, Spain. INTRODUCTION: Oxytocin receptor(OTR)antagonists have been proposed as tocolytic agents for preterm labor (PTL). However, OT can also activate the three vasopressin receptor (AVPR) subtypes including V1aR, which is expressed in myometrium and remains highly expressed throughout gestation. Atosiban (AT) possesses high affinity for both V1aR and OTRs and it is not clear if its tocolytic activity is also mediated via vasopressin antagonism, whilst the OTR-selective antagonist barusiban was not effective in delaying delivery in women with PTL. Using newly developed human OTR-and AVPR subtype-selective agonists and antagonists, we re-visited this long-standing question to investigate the role of the individual AVPR subtypes in human myometrial contraction. METHODS: Peptides were synthesized by manual Boc-SPPS, folded and purified by RP-HPLC. Ligand selectivity was established by measuring the Ca (OTR, V1aR, V1bR) and cAMP (V2R) response in CHO cell lines heterologously expressing the different human receptor subtypes. Isometric tension recordings were performed on strips of myometrium obtained from women delivering by pre-labor, elective Caesarean section with informed consent (n=\u22655/ligand). Contractile activity [integral, contraction frequency, duration and amplitude] was measured and the effect of rising molar concentrations (1nM-1\u00b5M) of OT, human OTR and V1aR/V1bR-specific peptides were compared and examined in the presence of the hOTR-selective antagonist Antag III (provided by Ferring) or AT (100nM). RESULTS: All ligands dose-dependently increased all contraction parameters except frequency. OT and the OTR-specific ligand, [Se-Se]-OT-OH induced the greatest increase in activity and [Se-Se]-OT-OH was as efficacious as OT. In the presence of Antag III the response to OT and [Se-Se]-OT-OH was completely inhibited, the response to AVP or to FE 201874 (hV1a/V1bR agonist, Ferring) however was not, indicating some involvement of the AVPRs. AT only inhibited the response to ligands at \u00a3100nM confirming its competitive mechanism CONCLUSIONS: Data suggests that contraction in the human myometrium is mainly driven by the hOTR. The observed involvement of hV1a/V1bR-selective ligands however warrants further investigation since this might be crucial for the much needed development of better and safer tocolytic agents for PTL.Role of S-NitrosatedMyosin Regulatory Light Polypeptide 9 in Uterine Smooth Muscle Contraction.

We included singleton births between 32-42 weeks gestation. Exclusion criteria were gestational age outside of 32-42 weeks, congenital anomalies and multiples. Our primary outcomes were stillbirth, neonatal death, or adverse composite neonatal outcome. RESULTS: There were 2.4 million singleton deliveries .Stillbirth was correlated with low birth weight.Adverse neonatal outcome was demonstrated in all deliveries at lower birthweights. Larger neonates (>95%) had increased stillbirth but decreased composite neonatal outcome between 32-36 weeks with increased adverse outcome at term.*Figure(s) will be available online.

Ziad Haidar, Oscar Viteri Molina, Baha Sibai, Suneet Chauhan, Janice Whitty. Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of TX, Houston, TX, USA. INTRODUCTION: Maternal obesity is a predictor of the large for gestational age newborns with paucity of publications on small for gestational age (SGA; birthweight <10% for GA). Our goal was to compare composite morbidities among deliveries with SGA vs appropriate for gestational age (AGA; birthweight 10-89%) among obese vs non-obese women undergoing repeat cesarean delivery (CD). METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a prospective observational study. Women who had elective CD at \u00b337weeks were studied. We excluded multiple gestations, fetal anomalies, more than one prior CD, diabetes, seizures, renal, thyroid, and hypertensive diseases. Cases were patients with body mass index (BMI)\u00b330 kg/m 2 and controls, BMI<30 kg/m 2 . CMM included transfusion, hysterectomy, operative injury, coagulopathy, thromboembolism, pulmonary edema, or death; CNM, respiratory distress syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis, severe intraventricular hemorrhage, seizure, or death. Multivariate logistic regression was used to control for maternal age, ethnicity, level of education, smoking, marital status, and neonatal sex. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence interval were calculated. RESULTS: Of 7561 women included in this study, 65% were cases and 35% controls. The rates of SGA differed significantly: 8 vs 12% (P<0.001). CMM of SGA-Case compared to SGA-Cont was statistically different (aOR 0.11, 95% CI 0.02-0.68). Overall, CNM was significantly higher in patients with SGA vs AGA (aOR 2.04, 95% CI 1.19-3.49). A significance was also noted when SGA-Cas was compared to AGA-Cas (aOR 2.1, 95% CI 0.53-3.95).CONCLUSIONS: SGA occurred in 8% of low risk obese women with prior CD. Paradoxically, CMM was lower in obese cases, possibly reflecting the caution that obese patients receive. CNM of SGA babies in obese vs non-obese women were similar. Our findings may assist in counseling patients and designing trials.Does a Massive Transfusion Protocol Improve Maternal Outcomes inObstetric Hemorrhage?

INTRODUCTION: Extremely preterm infants have high morbidity rates.Severe early morbidity is linked with long-term disability and neurodevelopmental delays. The association between maternal hypertension and severe early morbidity is unclear. We sought to evaluate the effect of maternal hypertension (HTN) on morbidity risk prior to discharge in infants 22+0 to 29+6 weeks gestational age (GA). METHODS: 72,016 infants born 22+0 to 29+6 weeks GA, in North American Vermont Oxford Network centers 2008-2011, and surviving to NICU discharge were analyzed for development of severe morbidity during NICU stay. Morbidities included chronic lung disease (CLD), intraventricular hemorrhage grades 3-4 (IVH), cystic periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), retinopathy of prematurity grades 3-5 (ROP), necrotizing entercolitis grades >2 (NEC), and infection. Fisher's exact test compared rates in HTN and -HTN within 2-week cohorts. Logistic regression was used to adjust, within cohorts, for birth weight, antenatal steroid exposure, infant sex, maternal race, location, prenatal care and birth year. Odds ratios are reported with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Infants born at lower GAs had higher rates of all morbidities. Rates of HTN increased with GA. HTN infants were smaller (mean 863\u00b1271 vs. 949\u00b1308 grams; p<.01), yet older (mean 27.0\u00b11.8 vs. 26.2\u00b12.1 wks GA; p<.01). After adjustment, HTN infants exhibited less serious morbidity than -HTN infants. Infants with HTN mothers had lower rates of serious morbidity than other infants at all GAs.Saturday PostersRESULTS: Black women with EGWG had increased risk for developing GDM compared to non-Hispanic whites with EGWG (aOR 1.26, p=0.026). Asian women had a decreased baseline risk for preeclampsia (aOR 0.62, p<0.001), Abut Asians with EGWG had increased risk for preeclampsia than non-Hispanic whites with EGWG (aOR 1.40, p=0.004). Negative interactions were found between Hispanic ethnicity and EGWG for macrosomia (aOR 0.79, p=0.012) and shoulder dystocia (aOR 0.82, p=0.014) compared to non-Hispanic whites with EGWG. No other significant interactions were seen.Odds ratios and P-value significance for race and EGWG interaction term\u015d p<0.05 *p<0.001 CONCLUSIONS: Maternal race/ethnicity and EGWG interact for several perinatal outcomes. Clinicians and populations researchers should consider this in clinical counseling and research design.Epidemiology and Predictors of Cesarean Delivery Complications inthe United States.

Evidence from nonobstetric surgery suggests that transfusion may be associated with wound healing complications. Our objective was to evaluate the risk for wound healing complications among patients transfused for a postpartum Hgb \u22657 to <10mg/dL. METHODS: Women undergoing cesarean delivery (CD) who participated in a study based on their history of a prior uterine scar were identified. Those with a postpartum Hgb \u22657 and <10mg/dL were included in the analysis. Rates of wound complications were compared in the transfused and not transfused groups. We used a multivariable regression model to identify factors which modified wound complications including AMA, race, multiple prior CD, baseline maternal disease, preeclampsia, and chorioamnionitis. RESULTS: 19,808 women had a postpartum Hgb \u22657 and <10mg/ dL. 2.2% (n=441) were transfused. Wound complications occurred in 23.8% (n=105) of the transfused group versus 9.1% (n=1759) of the not transfused group. In the unadjusted model, transfused patients had 3.13 times the risk of a wound complication than those not transfused (95%CI 2.77-3.53).

INTRODUCTION:The aim was to investigate the association between interpregnancy interval (IPI) and subsequent perinatal outcomes in a large population-based cohort. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of multiparous women with singleton gestations giving birth in the U.S. in 2011-2012. IPI was defined as the time between last live birth and current live birth. Women with Saturday Posters missing information regarding time interval since last live birth were excluded. IPI was categorized as 4-17 months, 18-36 months, 37-60 months, and >60 months. Statistical comparisons were made using chisquare tests and multivariable logistic regression models to control for confounding. Covariates included maternal age, prior preterm birth, prior cesarean, and medical comorbidities. Women with an 18-36 month IPI were designated as the referent. RESULTS: Of the 3,713,333 women meeting study criteria, 10.1% had an IPI of 4-17 months, 38.2% were 18-36 months, 26.0% were 37-60 months, and 25.8% were >60 months. Women with a longer IPI were more likely to be diagnosed with preeclampsia/gestational hypertension (2.9% at 4-17 months vs 4.5% >60 months, p<0.001), undergo induction of labor (IOL; 17.5% vs 21.8%, p<0.001) and cesarean delivery (CD; 29.2% vs 35.9%, p<0.001). Shorter IPI was associated with preterm delivery (<37 weeks; 15.8% vs 12.4%, p<0.001). On multivariable logistic regression, women with a shorter IPI were more likely to deliver preterm, yet less likely to undergo IOL. Their neonates had a higher risk of low 5-minute Apgar, small for gestational age (SGA), and NICU admission. Women with longer IPI had higher risk of multiple adverse perinatal outcomes, including cesarean delivery, SGA status, maternal ICU admission, 5-minute Apgar score <4, NICU admission, and preterm delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to women with 18-36 month IPIs, women with both shorter and longer IPIs are at increased risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Postpartum patient education should include counseling about increased risks associated with very short and long intervals.Do 2% Chlorhexidine (CHX) Wipes Reduce the Overall SurfaceBacterial Colonization of the External Perineum?

INTRODUCTION: MRI allows in vivo estimation of placental function and may improve antenatal identification of placental disease. We have previously shown, using R1, as biomarker of pO2, in Oxygen-Enhanced MRI (OE-MRI) and R2*, for oxygen saturation, in Blood Oxygen Level Dependent MRI (BOLD) that placental oxygen usage changes with gestation in normal pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the maternal oxygen challenge required for these techniques significantly changes placental perfusion, thus confounding our published placental oxygen usage finding. METHODS: Ten antenatal subjects were recruited at St. Mary's Hospital, Manchester. MR imaging (1.5T Philips scanner) took place at gestational ages 159-244 days, using the body coil for all sequences. T2 weighted localiser images identified a central placental slice in which Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) data was acquired. A FAIR-HASTE sequence was performed under medical air, then repeated after 8 minutes of 100% O 2 , both delivered at 15l/min.

INTRODUCTION: Magnesium sulphate (MgSO 4) is commonly administered for the treatment and prevention of eclampsia and for fetal neuroprotection before preterm birth. Despite this, the mechanisms of action of MgSO 4 are poorly understood, partly due to the lack of good cellular models. We are using an in vitro model of the placenta to examine the effects of MgSO 4 on the differentiation of cytotrophoblasts in the placenta, and determining the molecular mechanisms that mediate these effects in a model of placental inflammation.gestation and UTAD and PMA evaluated. FGR was pragmatically defined as <3rd centile birthweight. UTAD classified as abnormal if PI>1.4/notch present. PMA was classified as abnormal if length <10cm. Fishers's exact test was used for analysis. RESULTS: The prevalence of FGR/SGA age infants in this high risk cohort was 14.8% <3rd centile & 31% <10th centile. Of these babies, 23.3% had FGR requiring delivery <36 weeks. Using UTAD assessment at 22-24 weeks the PPV and NPV for FGR was 27.1%(CI 20.0-35.3) & 89.1%(CI 85.9-91.9).

Uterine tissues express efflux transporters, P-glycoprotein (P-gp, encoded by the ABCB1 gene) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, encoded by ABCG2 gene), but their role in pregnancy is unexplored. We hypothesize that P-gp and BCRP are involved in the differentiation of pregnant uterine muscle (myometrium) and that mechanical and hormonal stimuli regulate myometrial expression of ABCB1/P-gp and ABCG2/BCRP during gestation. METHODS: To test this hypothesis we measured the expression of P-gp and BCRP in the rat myometrium across gestation. Myometrial samples was collected from pregnant, laboring and post-partum (PP) Wistar rats (n=4-6/gestational day, GD), total RNA and protein was isolated for gene/ protein expression analysis using real-time PCR or Western blotting and localized with immunohistochemistry. To examine the effects of elevated progesterone (P4) during late gestation, rats were injected with P4 (16mg/ kg) or vehicle starting from GD20. The myometrial tissue from control and P4-treated rats were collected on GD21, 22, 23 (L), GD24 (only P4treated) and P-gp and BCRP expression was studied. The influence of early hormone withdrawal on P-gp and BCRP expression was examined by treatment of pregnant rats with P4 receptor antagonist RU486. We also used unilaterally pregnant rats to study ABCB1 and ABCG2 gene induction by static mechanical stretch. Pre-pregnancy and pre-delivery weights were used to calculate weight gain within or above IOM recommendations by BMI category. Racial categories were non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and Asian-American.

Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom. INTRODUCTION : Chronic fetal hypoxia is one of the most common problems in high-risk pregnancy. We have reported that chronic hypoxia triggers a fetal origin of cardiovascular dysfunction secondary to the generation of oxidative stress. Accordingly, hypoxic pregnancy in rats induced oxidative stress in the fetal heart and vessels and maternal treatment with the antioxidant vitamin C during hypoxic pregnancy prevented these effects (Giussani et al. PLoS ONE 7 (2): e31017, 2012). However, the source of fetal oxidative stress in hypoxic pregnancy is unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that xanthine oxidase (XO)derived reactive oxygen species trigger a fetal origin of cardiovascular dysfunction during hypoxic development using the chick embryo. METHODS: Fertilized eggs were randomly divided and incubated under normoxia or hypoxia (14% O 2 ) from day 0 (term is 21 days). From day 13 of incubation, the XO inhibitor allopurinol (5 mg/kg -1 ) or vehicle (4M NaOH, 0.2ml) was injected daily into the air cell for six consecutive days. At day 19, the embryos were euthanised, weighed and measured and blood was obtained for haematocrit. Second order femoral arteries were isolated for in vitro wire myography and tested with acetylcholine (Ach) \u00b1 LNAME. Basal cardiac function was assessed in isolated hearts under Langendorff preparation. Comparison were assessed by Two-way ANOVA+Tukey test. INTRODUCTION: Mean birth weight increased from the 1950s until the 1990s. However a recent large, American study utilizing birth certificate data and a study of over 68,000 term singleton births at our institution showed a reversal of this trend over the last decade. We sought to determine if ultrasound estimates of fetal growth followed the same trend in this cohort. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of women that had a full term singleton delivery between 2003 and 2013 who underwent a routine mid-trimester ultrasound between 16 and 24 weeks at Magee-Women's Hospital (MWH) were identified. Data were accrued from the Magee Obstetric Medical and Infant Database. Linear regression was utilized to evaluate the mean change per calendar year in head circumference(HC), biparietal diameter(BPD), abdominal circumference(AC)and femur length(FL). Models were then adjusted for maternal age, race, BMI, smoking, parity, fetal sex and gestational age at ultrasound. RESULTS: There were 102,259 deliveries at MWH from 2003-2013 and 46,028 ultrasounds from this cohort that met inclusion criteria. Mean gestational age at the time of ultrasound was 19.2\u00b11.2 weeks. Although mean birth weight decreased over time(3458 g to 3395 g, P< .001) fetal growth measures assessed at the mid-trimester increased. There were statistically significant increases in mean HC (adjusted \u03b2=0.047 mm/yr, P<.001), AC (adjusted \u03b2=0.044 mm/yr,P<.001) and FL (adjusted \u03b2=0.016 mm/yr, P<.001) per calendar year. FL and AC showed the greatest yearly increase in mean ultrasound measure in the adjusted models. *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a significant reduction in birth weight,fetal biometric measurements in the mid-trimester have increased over the past decade. This discrepancy suggests that the decline in birth weight is rooted in diminished intrauterine growth in the third trimester. Given the developmental origins of disease evidence that reduced growth in the second half of pregnancy is linked to offspring disease risk, the long-term health consequences of this finding warrants further study.",

INTRODUCTION: To determine if isolated single umbilical artery (SUA) singleton pregnancy is associated with fetal growth restriction (FGR) and congenital cardiac abnormalities. METHODS: This is an IRB-approved, retrospective cohort study of pregnant women identified with isolated SUA during routine anatomy survey at Mount Sinai Roosevelt and Mount Sinai St. Luke's between January 2003 and December 2013. We collected ultrasound biometric values, serial EFWs from sonograms performed every two to four weeks, fetal echocardiography results, and actual birth weights. Fetal growth restriction was defined as EFW \u2264 tenth percentile. RESULTS: Of 59,032 deliveries occurring during this time period, 376 (0.64%) were diagnosed with SUA at anatomy survey; of these, 332 (88.29%) were isolated SUA. Prior to delivery, 10 cases out of 332 (3%) were identified with FGR; 9 (90%) of these were small for gestational age (SGA) at time of birth. Two out of 332 (0.6%) had an abnormal fetal echocardiogram. CONCLUSIONS: Fetuses with isolated SUA are at increased risk of fetal growth restriction. At our institution, antenatal ultrasounds were able to identify as growth-restricted 90% of isolated-SUA fetuses that were SGA at birth. A very small percentage of these fetuses had cardiac abnormalities. Increased surveillance for fetuses with isolated SUA is recommended.",

INTRODUCTION: Metformin(MET) mitigates hepatic lipid accumulation and improves lipid metabolism in the setting of diabetes/ metabolic syndrome. Because MET crosses the placenta, we examined the effect of maternal MET on fetal liver and brain fatty acid(FA) metabolism using a rat model of gestational metabolic syndrome. METHODS: Female Wistar rats (6wks old) were fed normal(NORM) or high fat/high sugar(HCAL) diets for 5wks. After mating with NORM males, half of HCAL dams received MET(300mg/kg,PO,daily); dams (6-8/group) continued their diets through euthanasia on gestation day 19. Fetal livers and brains were analyzed for triglyceride(TG) FAs and phospholipid(PL) FAs, respectively. Fetal livers were analyzed for FA metabolism-related gene expression. Data were analyzed using ANOVA/ Bonferroni. RESULTS: Prenatal HCAL exposure significantly decreased polyunsaturated FAs(PUFAs: 20:4 {arachidonic acid/AA}, 22:4n6, and 22:5n6) in fetal brains (p<0.05). Fetal livers showed significantly increased saturated FA(18:0) and monounsaturated FAs(MUFAs: 18:1n9, 18:1n7) and decreased PUFAs(18:2, 20:4{AA}, 22:6n3 {docosahexaenoic acid/ DHA}); exposure to MET significantly attenuated HCAL-induced MUFAs METHODS: Vaginal fluid was obtained from 43 women with BV, 52 with VVC and 77 with no vulvovaginal disorders. Diagnosis was based on microscopy, Nugent score, culture for Candida and clinical signs. Vaginal fluid concentrations of D-and L-lactic acid, alpha amylase, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8 and hyaluronidase were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: Vaginal fluid alpha amylase was correlated with the vaginal concentration of D-(p=0.0020) but not with L-lactic acid (p=0.2746). Correlations were observed between alpha amylase and SLPI (p<0.0001), hyaluronidase (p=0.0003), NGAL (p=0.0020) and MMP-8 (p = 0.0049). The median vaginal fluid alpha amylase level was 1.94 mU/ml in control woman, 1.45 in women with VVC and 1.07 in women with BV (p=0.1704). CONCLUSIONS: Since D-lactic acid is produced primarily by Lactobacilli while L-lactic acid is produced by bacteria and host epithelial cells, the results suggest that the more alpha amylase is present the higher is the concentration of vaginal Lactobacilli. NGAL and SLPI have anti-bacterial properties while hyaluronidase and MMP-8, by promoting degradation of the extracellular matrix, increase glycogen availability. Their association with alpha amylase levels suggests that they are inducible in the vaginal epithelia by Lactobacilli or by products of glycogen metabolism. Exogenous alpha amylase supplementation may be a useful adjunct to promote growth of lactobacilli in women with BV.",

INTRODUCTION: Vaginal predominance of Lactobacillus sp. represents a healthy state, in part by local immune induction. The shift to anaerobic bacteria predominance characterizes an abnormal vaginal flora, which triggers a local immune response imbalance. Natural antimicrobials, as beta defensins (HBDs), are involved in vaginal primary defense. We evaluated HBD1, 2, 3 and 4 according to bacterial community in the vagina based on the microbiome characterization METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, specimens of vaginal swab and lavage fluid were collected from 93 reproductive-age and nonpregnant women at primary medical care units in Jo\u00e3o Pessoa, PB, Brazil. The studied groups were defined according to the type of vaginal bacterial communities defined by high throughput sequencing of V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA gene. HBD 1-4 concentrations were measured in vaginal lavage fluid by enzyme-linked immunoassay, and compared by Kruskal-Wallis test, p < 0.05 significance. RESULTS: Eighteen samples were classified into bacteria community I (Lactobacillus crispatus predominance) and constituted the studied group 1. Groups 2 and 3 were established by 45 and 24 women presenting communities III (L. iners predominance) and IV (not dominated by Lactobacillus sp.), respectively. Only 2 and 1 samples represented communities II (predominance of L.gasseri) and V (predominance of L. jensenii), respectively. HBDs were evaluated in 87 samples. HBD1, 2 and 4 levels were not statistically different among the three studied groups, while HBD3 concentration was statistically lower in the group 3 compared to the group 2 (p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The studied population showed diversity in bacteria communities that had no effect on HBD1, 2 and 4 vaginal levels. The no Lactobacilli-dominated flora can trigger an anaerobic environment, which inhibits the HBD3 activity. As HBD3 is the most responsive defensin to microbial, the lower expression of HBD3 impairs the immune defense, enabling anaerobic bacteria proliferation. Identifying such mechanisms will contribute to the understanding of immune response deficiency according to diverse vaginal microbiota",

INTRODUCTION : Clinical dogma has held that the endometrium is a sterile environment, with infections occurring only in the pathologic setting. The advent of microbiome sequencing has revolutionized our ability to detect unidentified microorganisms. Our objective was to characterize the endometrial microbiome in healthy reproductive aged women using DNA sequencing. METHODS: In a prospective observational study, standard endometrial sampling via biopsy pipelle was performed on eleven healthy, reproductive aged volunteers who denied a history of infertility or gynecologic disease. Each sample was processed using a commercially available total DNA preparation kit (MoBio Inc. PowerSOIL TM max). 16s Illumina-compatible ribosomal RNA amplicons were generated from a hypervariable region of the 16s gene from each sample, in triplicate, using standard PCR cycling conditions. Each amplicon was quantitated via gel electrophoresis and Picogreen TM fluorometry prior to pooling at equimolar concentrations for paired-end (PE) 300bp Illumina sequencing. RESULTS: Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) was used to perform phylogenetic analyses including beta-diversity and rarefaction analysis which revealed that the endometrium contains a core, conserved microbiome that is distinct from matched vaginal environments as well as from published vaginal microbiome profiles. At a phylum level, three dominant contributors to endometrial microbiome were identified: Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria. Unweighted UniFrac TM analysis demonstrated that taxonomic composition was consistent between samples and did not vary by menstrual cycle phase. Most interestingly, the primary driver of endometrial composition was a previously uncharacterized Actinobacterium. CONCLUSIONS: Here we demonstrate for the first time that healthy endometrium is not a sterile environment, and report a straight-forward method to sample the endometrium without vaginal micriobiome contamination. We have identified a novel bacterium, which has never before been found that is the primary driver of microbial diversity in the endometrium. Ongoing studies are underway to sequence endometrium in the setting of infertility, which could become an important part of clinical testing in the future. NICHD, NIH",

INTRODUCTION: Components of the IGF system, IGF-1, IGF-2 and IGF binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), enhance in vitro embryo quality and implantation rates in both animal models and in human IVF. We evaluated whether differences in serum levels of these components in women prior to initiation of an IVF cycle would be predictive of subsequent IVF outcome. METHODS: In this retrospective study sera from women obtained at day 2 of their IVF cycle (at baseline before stimulation) were assayed for IGF-1, IGF-2 and IGFBP-1 by ELISA. Samples from 54 women with a live birth, 38 with a transient biochemical pregnancy, 45 with a spontaneous abortion, 54 who did not become pregnant and 35 who had an ectopic pregnancy were available for analysis. Associations between the assays and outcome were evaluated by the Kruskall Wallis test. RESULTS: Median concentrations of IGF-1 were 29.1 ng/ml in women with a live birth, 25.1 in women with a biochemical pregnancy, 21.2 in spontaneous abortion, 18.7 when not pregnant and 4.2 in those with an ectopic pregnancy. Conversely, median levels of IGF-2 were reduced in women with a live birth (0.30 ng/ml) as opposed to 0.36, 0.41, 0.43 and 0.39 ng/ml in women with a biochemical pregnancy, spontaneous Saturday Posters abortion, not pregnant or having an ectopic pregnancy, respectively. Median IGFBP-1 concentrations were markedly elevated in women with a live birth (23.6 ng/ml) compared to 0.5, 14.1, 14.0 and 9.5 ng/ ml in women with a biochemical pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, not pregnant or with an ectopic pregnancy. Differences between groups on each test were highly significant (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal serum levels of IGF-1, IGF-2 and IGFBP-1 at the start of an IVF cycle and prior to embryo transfer are correlated with the likelihood of a live birth vs. other outcomes. While there were no differences in the number of oocytes retrieved, oocyte quality or fertilization rates between groups it remains uncertain whether alterations in maternal IGF system components caused subtle changes in oocyte quality or early post-fertilization events. The role of maternal IGF system components in promoting optimal embryo implantation is another possible explanation for our observations. (VDR) . Polymorphisms in the VDR gene were correlated with cell proliferation and immune function but to date few studies have investigated the presence or absence of correlation between the VDR polymorphisms and fertility. Since female VDR knockout mice exhibit defects in follicular maturation we sought to investigate VDR polymorphisms frequency (BsmI, FokI and TaqI) in normal (fertilityproven) and in women undergoing fertility treatments.",

The Qui-square and Odds ratio (GraphPAD, Prism) were used to compute the statistical difference between groups (p<0.05). RESULTS: The genotipic distribution for TaqI and FokI SNPs did not differ significantly between fertile and infertile subjects (p=0.6 and p=0,32 respesctively). The frequency of BsmI SNP, BB, Bb and bb were 19%, 33% and 48% in fertile patients and 23%, 34%, 43% in infertile patients respectively (p= 0,91), however the alleles frequency B and b were 36%, 64% in fertile patients and 61%, 39% in infertile patients respectively (p= 0,007). CONCLUSIONS: We aim to complete the study with a total of 300 women, however, our preliminary results detected an association between BsmI polymorphism and female fertility in the VDR gene. INTRODUCTION: AMH correlates with ovarian reserve and response to controlled ovarian stimulation. Accumulating data suggests that serum AMH level may also predict ART outcomes. However, AMH is elevated in PCOS women and it is unknown whether it may predict ART outcomes in this population. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 129 PCOS women (Rotterdam criteria) undergoing their first fresh IVF/ICSI cycle. Women were divided into 3 groups according to <25 th (low), 25 to 75 th (average), or >75 th (high) percentile of serum AMH concentration. Cycle stimulation parameters and reproductive outcomes were compared between groups. RESULTS: Women in the low AMH group were older than those in the average or high AMH (p<0.05), and required greater gonadotropin dose for stimulation compared to the high AMH group (p<0.05). Women with high AMH had greater testosterone level compared to women in the low or average AMH groups. No differences were noted between groups in terms of maximal E2, oocytes retrieved and fertilization rate. However, low AMH women had significantly greater live birth rates (p<0.05) and showed a trend towards greater clinical pregnancy rates compared to women in the average and high AMH groups (p=0.09). IR strongly correlates with BMI in a population of non-hispanic caucasian women; specifically a BMI less than 29 kg/m 2 is highly predictive of non-IR. They would likely not benefit from insulin sensitizers, and have a very low risk of gestational diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Thus the etiology of PCOS in the \"lean PCOS\" patient appears very different from the hyperinsulinemic, hyperandrogenism of Stein-Leventhal PCOS. INTRODUCTION: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common reproductive disorders in women. PCOS is generally diagnosed by anovulation, hyper-androgenism, and/or the presence of multiple cysts within the ovaries. The etiology of this condition is poorly understood with its highly variable phenotypic presentation likely secondary to variations in genotypic expression. Long term risks of PCOS include insulin resistance and endometrial hyperplasia or cancer. Through this is a pilot study, we compared miRNA expression, small non-coding RNAs (19 -25 nucleotides) involved in gene expression, in patients with PCOS and healthy controls. METHODS: 12 adult women diagnosed with PCOS and managed without the use of any hormone modulating medications (>6 months) were recruited along with 12 aged-matched healthy controls. Patients had no other known medical co-morbidities that would confound the results obtained. Serum miRNA was isolated and miRNA PCR arrays (Nanostring nCounter Analysis System), and analyzed for changes in 800 commonly studied miRNAs. Background was designated as the mean of the negative controls plus 1 standard deviation and only significant data (p<0.05) was considered. Confirmatory tests performed using real-time PCR. RESULTS: After correcting for multiple testing using False Discovery Rate (FDR), two miRNAs survived (miR-16 and miR-181a). miR-181a had an elevated level in the healthy controls versus PCOS patients with a fold change of 1.8 (p-value = 3.5 x 10 -4 ) and miR-16 was elevated in PCOS patients versus controls (fold change = 1.6; p-value = 9.1 x 10 -4 ). If we did not use an FDR, 12 different miRNAs had a p-value < 0.05. Four of the miRNAs showed a lower value in PCOS patients versus controls and nine showed an elevated value in PCOS patients versus controls. CONCLUSIONS: These two miRNAs may serve as potential biomarkers for PCOS and may present targets for molecular therapy. miR-181a is known for its tumor suppressive properties which may explain the increased susceptibility of PCOS patients to endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. Similarly miR-16 is involved with glucose metabolism, with its up-regulation involved in insulin resistance in PCOS patients. We plan to validate these biomarkers in additional patients with analysis of endometrial expression.",

Elisa Scarinci, Anna Tropea, Francesca Moro, Federica Romani, Ornella Alesiani, Antonio Lanzone, Rosanna Apa. Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy. INTRODUCTION: Fibulin-1 is an extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein that interacts with several ECM proteins including elastic fibers and basement membranes. Its specific function is unknown, but in the last years fibulin1 is emerging as a new factor in the development or progression of cardiovascular diseases. In particular, high plasma levels of fibulin-1 have been detected in patients with type 2 diabetes (DM2) and correlate with hypertension and other cardiovascular risk markers, such as plasma N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide and arterial stiffness. Several studies also reported a correlation with atherosclerosis and systemic inflammation, being fibulin-1 able to bind fibrinogen. Based on these findings, the purpose of our study was to investigate a possible relation between fibulin-1 and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a heterogeneous condition characterized by several symptoms and clinical signs related to reproductive and cardiometabolic disorders. Interestingly, it is often associated with insulin resistance, DM2, obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, oxidative stress and inflammation, well-known cardiovascular risk factors. To this aim we investigated fibulin-1 plasma levels in euglycemic women with PCOS and in healthy age-and body mass index-matched controls who attended to Unit of human reproductive pathophysiology, Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome. METHODS: Plasma was collected using EDTA, or heparin as an anticoagulant, and quantitative determination of human fibulin-1 was assayed by ELISA Kit.",

A subset of women (n=458) from the original cohort was recontacted and reinterviewed, collecting detailed data related to oncofertility treatment and reproductive history. Statistical analysis was completed using Wilcoxon, Fisher's exact, or chi square. RESULTS: Of the original cohort who provided oncofertility information, 4.9% (22/454) sought oncofertility treatment or counseling. 18.2% had gonadotropin injections, 22.7% had oocyte cryopreservation, 27.3% had embryo cryopreservation, and 13.6% had an oncofertility consultation but did not pursue treatment. There were 366 women with complete information regarding parity at cancer diagnosis; of these, 47 were nulliparous and 319 parous. The nulliparous and parous groups were similarly aged (median 40.9 and 41.4 years, p=0.24) and did not differ for racial (p=0.40) or ethnic (p=0.64) distribution. More women in the nulliparous group tended to have Stage I disease, however this was not statistically significant (74.5% vs 53.3%, p=0.06). Triple negative receptor tumor type did not differ between the groups (29.8% vs. 20.8%, p=0.19) . Oncofertility treatment was pursued more often by nulliparous women than parous women, 17% (8/47) versus 1% (3/317), respectively, p<0.001. More nulliparous women became pregnant following a breast cancer diagnosis than parous women, 15% (7/47) versus 2% (6/319), respectively, p<0.001. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the number of women who sought oncofertility treatment or counseling in this cohort was low, and the underlying reasons for this warrant further investigation. Parity status at the time of breast cancer diagnosis significantly influenced pursuit of oncofertility treatment and subsequent pregnancy attainment in young women with breast cancer. INTRODUCTION: Fertility preservation is being offered clinically for many women with cancer. In treating these women, many clinicians adjust traditional ART protocols to meet time restrictions the patient and her treating oncologist may be working with or to avoid estrogen elevations in estrogen-sensitive cancers. While innovative, the published data on the outcomes of such practices are lacking. Our objective was to address this knowledge gap through evaluation of our own center's experience. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of fertility preservation cycles for women with cancer performed in our center between '01 and '13. We included cases involving either oocyte or embryo cryopreservation. Our exposures of interest included controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) starting in the luteal phase and use of letrozole. Our primary outcome was number of mature oocytes retrieved. Secondary outcomes included duration of COS (days) and peak estradiol (E2) levels (pg/ml). Analyses were performed using appropriate bivariate statistics in SPSS. RESULTS: 46 women were identified. 10 of these women took letrozole during stimulation and 5 of the women started their stimulation in the luteal phase. 6 women had both adjuvants. Women receiving letrozole had significantly lower peak E2 levels compared to women who did not (549.0 \u00b1 292.5 vs. 2246.4 \u00b1 1052.3, p<0.001) while number of mature oocytes and days of COS were no different (11.3 \u00b1 6 vs. 12.1 \u00b1 6.3, p=0.7; 10.5 \u00b1 2.5 vs. 9.6 \u00b1 2.4, p=0.2). Outcomes for women who initiated stimulation in the luteal phase of their cycle were no different than women who started stimulation in the follicular phase per routine. (mature oocytes: 11.2 \u00b1 6.3 vs. 12.5 \u00b1 5.7 p=0.6; Duration of COS: 10.2 \u00b1 2.6 vs. 9.9 \u00b1 2.3, p=0.7; peak E2: 1765.7 \u00b1 0.2 vs. 1263.4 \u00b1 1482.1, p=0.3 ). CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvants including letrozole during COS and initiation of COS in the luteal phase yield excellent results for women with cancer undergoing fertility preservation. ",

The present study extends our previous findings from first pregnancy after referral to cumulative outcome. In addition to the confirmation of HLA-DRB1*15 and HLA-DQB1*05:01/02 as prognostically negative for SRPL after the birth of a boy, we report the same for HLA-DRB1*07. Our findings support the hypothesis that an aberrant immune response to the semi-allogenic fetus by the mother's immune system may play an important role in SRPL following the birth of a boy.

Control mice were injected with \u03b1-GalCer, rosiglitazone, or DMSO (n=10-20 each). Following injection, mice were monitored via video camera to determine gestational length and stillbirth rate. Additionally, pregnant mice were euthanized 4h (n=6-10 each) and 22h (n=8-10 each) post-injection of rosiglitazone, including the corresponding controls. Activation of T cells, neutrophils, DCs, and M1 and M2 macrophages were determined by flow cytometry in the liver, uterine, and decidual tissues.

CONCLUSIONS: Rosiglitazone rescues NKT activation-induced PTB by rapidly reducing the activation of T cells, M1 and M2 macrophages, and neutrophils at the maternal-fetal interface and by suppressing the local and systemic pro-inflammatory response in the mother. These findings demonstrate that the PPAR-\u03b3 pathway is a new molecular target for future preventative methods for PTB. (CD4+IFN\u03b3+), Th2 (CD4+IL10+), Th9 (CD4+IL9+), Th17 (CD4+IL17+), and Tc17 (CD8+IL7+) cells were determined by flow cytometry. Plasma progesterone, estradiol, and cytokine concentrations were determined using ELISA or multiplex assay. RESULTS: 1) Administration of hCG increased the number of M2-like macrophages (p=0.035) and reduced the number of M1-like macrophages (p=0.043) in the decidual tissues; 2) administration of hCG increased the proportion, but not the number, of decidual Th17 cells (p=0.015); 3) administration of hCG diminished the number of Th9 (p=0.043) and Tc17 (p=0.05) cells; 4) plasma IL1\u03b2 concentrations were higher in mice injected with hCG than in controls (p=0.043); and 5) no differences were observed in plasma progesterone and estradiol concentrations between mice injected with hCG or PBS. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of hCG in pregnant mice creates an anti-inflammatory micro-environment at the maternal-fetal interface by reducing M1-like macrophages and increasing M2-like macrophagesan M1-M2 polarization. Administration of hCG in pregnant mice also prompts an anti-inflammatory response in the maternal circulation by reducing pro-inflammatory Th9 and Tc17 cells. These events were not associated with plasma progesterone and estradiol concentrations. These results provide further information regarding the immune mechanism whereby hCG maintains pregnancy and prevents preterm birth. hypothesised that the fetal skin would produce LL-37 in response to inflammatory stimuli, and that this might contribute to intrauterine and fetal inflammation. The aim of this project was to determine if fetal skin expressed LL-37 and to explore the response to the inflammatory stimulus lipopolysaccharide (LPS). METHODS: Skin samples were collected from the torsos of 16 human fetuses after medical termination of pregnancy between 13 and 20 weeks gestation, and frozen for immunohistochemistry. Human fetal keratinocytes were cultured using an explant outgrowth technique, and treated with LPS 1 mg/ml or untreated as control. Cells were harvested at 3 and 24 hours. Fetal ovine skin was obtained from date-mated Australian Merino ewes (term = 148+/-2 days) bred to have singleton pregnancies. Animals were injected with 10 mg intra-amniotic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or control 5, 12, 24 or 48 hours before delivery at 124 days. RNA was extracted from cultured human keratinocytes and ovine skin, and cathelicidin gene (CAMP) expression analysed by Taqman PCR. RESULTS: hCAP/LL-37 was immunolocalised in the epidermis of human fetal skin at all gestations examined. LPS stimulation of human fetal keratinocytes resulted in downregulation of CAMP (p<0.05) despite increasing other inflammatory chemokines such as IL-8. SMAP-29 (sheep cathelicidin orthologue) transcription was also decreased after 24 hours of intrauterine LPS treatment (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The unexpected reduction in cathelicidin transcription by fetal skin in response to LPS may contribute to preterm babies' vulnerability to skin infections. Further study could help identify whether cathelicidin could be a useful therapy to prevent newborn skin infections.",

            "text": "Labor: An Influx of CD8 T EM Cells at the Maternal-Fetal Interface. Yi Xu, 1 Roberto Romero, 1 Tippi C Mackenzie, 2 Nardhy Gomez-Lopez. T cells reside at the maternal-fetal interface (decidua basalis and decidua parietalis) throughout pregnancy. An influx of memory-like CD45RO+CD4+ T cells at the maternal-fetal interface is associated with the process of spontaneous labor at term (Gomez-Lopez, et al., Am J Reprod Immunol 2013) . However, it is unknown whether these T cells express markers of central or effector memory, and whether this T-cell repertoire is altered at the maternal-fetal interface of women who undergo spontaneous preterm labor/birth. METHODS: Decidual basalis and decidua parietalis were isolated from women who delivered at term with (sTL, n=23) and without (TNL, n=13) spontaneous labor, and preterm with (sPTL, n=21) and without (PTNL, n=10) spontaneous labor. Leukocytes were isolated by enzymatic dissociation from decidual tissues. Na\u00efve (CD45RA+CCR7+), central memory (CD45RA-CCR7+, T CM ), effector memory (CD45RA-CCR7-, T EM ) and CD45RA+ effector (CD45RA+CCR7-) T-cell populations were determined by flow cytometry, within the CD3+CD4+ or CD3+CD8+ gate. A p-value of 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: 1) A differential T-cell distribution was observed in the decidua basalis compared to the decidua parietalis; (2) the proportion of CD4 T EM cells in the decidua basalis was higher in the sTL than in the TNL group, while the proportion of na\u00efve CD4 T cells was lower; (3) the proportion of CD8 T EM cells in the decidua basalis was higher in women with sPTL than in those in sTL, while the proportion of na\u00efve CD4 and CD8 T cells was lower; and (4) the proportion of CD8 T EM cells in the decidua parietalis was lower in women with sPTL than in the PTNL group. CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous term labor is characterized by an influx of CD4 T EM cells, whereas spontaneous preterm labor is characterized by an influx ofCD8 T EM cells at the maternal-fetal interface. These results suggest that spontaneous preterm labor is associated with the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells that previously encountered and responded to a specific antigen (i.e., the paternal-fetal antigen). Our findings provide further evidence that maternal-fetal rejection is one of the mechanisms of disease in the pathogenesis of spontaneous preterm labor. Preterm neonates are at an increased risk for shortterm complications due to the immaturity of multiple organ systems, and are highly susceptible to infection. It was recently shown that the neonatal host defense against infection is maintained by a temporal presence of immunosuppressive CD71+ erythroid cells (Shokrollah et al., Nature 2013) . The aims of this study were to investigate (1) whether there are fewer CD71+ erythroid cells in the cord blood of premature newborns than in term newborns, and (2) whether these cells are present in the maternal periphery and reduced in women who undergo preterm labor/birth. METHODS: Maternal peripheral blood and umbilical cord blood were collected from women who delivered: 1) preterm with labor (PTL, n=19), 2) preterm without labor (PTNL, n=11), 3) at term with labor (TL, n=45), and 4) at term without labor (TNL, n=21). Mononuclear cells were isolated from these samples by density gradient centrifugation using the Ficoll Paque Plus medium. CD71+ erythroid cells were identified as CD235a+CD71+ within the CD3-gate by flow cytometry as proportions and numbers. Acquisitions and analyses were performed on a BD LSRII flow cytometer system, using FACSDiva\u2122 v6.0 software. A p-value of \u00a30.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: 1) The proportion of CD71+ erythroid cells was 100-fold higher in cord blood than in maternal blood; 2) fewer CD71+ erythroid cells were found in cord blood from women who underwent PTL than from women who delivered PTNL; 3) fewer CD71+ erythroid cells were seen in cord blood from women who underwent TL than from women who delivered TNL; 4) no differences were seen in cord blood CD71+ erythroid cells between women who underwent PTL and women who delivered TL; and 5) fewer CD71+ erythroid cells were seen in maternal blood from women who underwent PTL than from women who delivered PTNL. CONCLUSIONS: Term and preterm labor are characterized by a reduction of CD71+ erythroid cells in umbilical cord blood. Preterm labor is also characterized by a reduction of CD71+ erythroid cells in the maternal circulation. These novel findings suggest that a premature reduction of CD71+ erythroid cells in the cord blood and maternal blood may contribute to the process of preterm labor. Cervical insufficiency is a risk factor for preterm birth characterized by premature dilation of the cervix in the absence of uterine contractions. Organization of fibrillar collagen in the extracellular matrix determines the biomechanical properties of the cervix. Collagen fibrillogenisis (synthesis, processing and assembly) is a complex process that is regulated in part by proteoglycans such as decorin. The focus of this study was to determine if decorin regulates collagen fibrillogenisis and ultimately cervical function during pregnancy. METHODS: Decorin transcripts and protein were analyzed. Decorin null mice were assessed. The ultrastructure of collagen was analyzed through transmission electron microscopy. Biomechanical testing was conducted to assess stiffness and strength. RESULTS: Decorin mRNA and protein expression were constant in nonpregnant (NP) and pregnant cervix. Protein expression was restricted to stroma. Decorin null females had normal parturition and cervical collagen fibril ultrastructure appeared similar to wild type cervix before (gestation day 15) and during (day 18) cervical ripening. Unexpectedly and in contrast to the decorin null late pregnant cervix, the collagen ultrastructure in the NP and gestation day 6 decorin null cervices was abnormal with irregular shaped fibrils of variable size interspersed between normal fibrils. Consistent with the timing of defects in collagen ultrastructure, the NP and early pregnant (day 6) decorin null cervices were mechanically compromised with reduced strength and stiffness. Consistent with normal collagen ultrastructure in late pregnancy, biomechanical parameters were normal in decorin null cervices on gestation day 15 and 18. CONCLUSIONS: Decorin regulates cervical collagen architecture and consequently its biomechanical properties differently during different stages of reproduction. Specifically, this study demonstrates a role for decorin in guiding collagen fibrillogenesis in the NP and early pregnant cervix. This timing corresponds with the activity of the collagen cross-link forming enzyme, lysyl oxidase (LOX). Ongoing experiments will address the interaction of decorin with LOX in regulating collagen fibrillogenesis and test the hypothesis that lack of decorin in early pregnancy may be a risk factor for cervical insufficiency.",

Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, USA. INTRODUCTION: There is minimal data regarding pregnancy outcomes in primigravida or nulliparous women with a shortened cervix who have undergone cerclage placement. Many previous studies evaluated cerclage efficacy in women with a shortened cervix and a history of preterm birth. Although some of the investigations evaluated all women with a shortened cervix, none exclusively evaluated the outcomes of those women who were defined as primigravida or nulliparous without a pregnancy lasting beyond 14 weeks. We sought to determine if these subsets of women would benefit from cerclage placement in the presence of a shortened cervix. METHODS: This investigation is a retrospective cohort study involving data collected between 01/01/2008-06/01/2014 in women whose cervical length measured < 25 mm prior to 24 weeks gestation. Additional inclusion criteria involved any pregnant, primigravida women and/or nulliparous women who had never carried a pregnancy beyond 14 weeks gestational age. Our primary outcome involved comparison of those women who received cerclage vs. expectant management, and the length of time from diagnosis of short cervix < 25 mm and delivery between the two groups. Secondary outcomes include evaluation of preterm delivery rates at certain GAs and outcomes based on a range of cervical lengths. We also compared outcomes in women receiving vaginal or IM progesterone to women who had a cerclage or those who were being expectantly managed.",

These same subsets of women had a higher risk for delivery prior to 32 weeks if a cerclage was placed compared to those who were expectantly managed (R.R 6.7 [1.45-30.6]) and when compared to those women who had vaginal or IM progesterone intervention (R.R. 3.7 [1.0 to 13.4]). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates no benefit of cerclage placement in primigravida women or nulliparous women who have never carried a pregnancy beyond 14 weeks gestational age. Until further investigations can be performed with a larger sample size, our data would indicate that cerclage placement should be discouraged in these subsets of women. Recently, the role of inflammatory cells that migrate into the amniochorion environment has been proposed as a mechanisms of induction of connective tissue degradation of these structures, leading to rupture. Objective. The aim of the present study was to develop an in vitro model of the ACM rupture event that emulates the actual rupture sequence. METHODS: Full-thickness human ACMs were obtained after delivery by elective C/S from women at 37-40 weeks of gestation, with no evidence of active labor. The membranes were cultured in a two compartment experimental model in which amnion was facing the upper compartment and chorion to the lower chamber. The ACMs were subjected to a mechanical stress of 5.1 g/cm 2 along all incubation period. Membranes were treated with bacterial collagenase to develop a reference model of the kinetics of rupture of the membranes. Other tissues were coincubated with preparations of leukocytes isolated from the choriodecidual compartment of ACM obtained from women with labor, and without labor. The ACMs were observed during 48 hours after the stimulus until they were broken. We quantified active matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-9) in every experiment. RESULTS: Ten different experiments in duplicates revealed that all membranes were ruptured after 6 h in the presence of bacterial collagenase. Treatment with leukocytes isolated from women in labor using concentrations from 1 to 5 million cells per well resulted in the rupture of the membranes in a range from 24 to 48 h (n=18). Cells obtained from non-laboring tissues failed to induce rupture of the membranes after 48 h of incubation. Higher concentration of active MMP-9 was associated to tissues in which rupture was observed. CONCLUSIONS: It was possible to develop an in vitro model of the rupture of the membranes using co-incubation with leukocytes isolated from membranes obtained from women with active spontaneous labor. This is the first model of rupture of the membranes including a potential mediator of the degradation of the connective tissue. This model will allow the analysis of the sequential events leading to the rupture of the membranes. Gilner, Stephanie Pierce, Thomas Price, Chad Grotegut. Obstetrics & Gynecology, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA. INTRODUCTION: We encountered a patient with a non-contractile uterus. She had a germ line mutation of a T-type calcium (Ca 2+ ) channel protein (Cav3.1), but no other evident clinical/genetic abnormalities. We hypothesized that a T-type Ca 2+ channel plays a critical role in uterine contractility, which may be useful in development of a uterine-specific tocolytic therapy. We used a preferential T-type Ca 2+ channel antagonist to assess the role of these channels in murine uterine contractility. METHODS: Mibefradil (Mib) is a Ca 2+ channel antagonist with high affinity/specificity for low-voltage-activated T-type Ca 2+ channels. Uterine tissue from non-pregnant and term pregnant wild-type C57BL/6J mice was suspended in a tissue bath to measure contraction force. The effect of Mib on spontaneous and oxytocin-induced uterine contractility was expressed as percentage of baseline contractility. Dose response curves were constructed using nonlinear regression and the best-fit curves compared between treatment groups (4 mice/group). Figure( s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Mibefradil, a preferential T-type Ca 2+ channel antagonist, decreases spontaneous uterine contractility in a non-pregnant and pregnant murine model. Furthermore, Mibefradil markedly decreases oxytocin-induced contractility in pregnant tissue. In vivo work is needed to determine the effect of Mibefradil on preterm labor.",

Treatment with the P4 receptor antagonist RU486 significantly decreased ABCB1 and ABCG2 mRNA levels, whereas artificial maintenance of elevated P4 prevented the fall of ABCB1 and ABCG2 genes. Moreover, both genes were up-regulated only in gravid but not in the empty horns of unilaterally pregnant rats. Protein expression levels of BCRP but not P-gp paralleled the transcript levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate significant changes of P-gp and BCRP in rat myometrium through pregnancy; their exact role in the myometrial differentiation is still under investigation. Our lab has defined the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and it related unfolded protein response (UPR) to be a critical players in regulating gestational length. An integrated ER stress response maintains uterine quiescence by disabling the contractile architecture in a caspase-3 (CASP3)-dependent manner 1,2 . In contrast at term the induction of the unfolded protein response blocks both ER stress and CASP3 activation allowing the pregnant uterus to regain its contractile potential. More recently the ER stress and the UPR have been implicated in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Therefore the goal of this study was to assess if the markers of ER stress and the UPR are present in the circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells, (PBMCs) across gestation. As in co-operation with endocrine factors, circulating PBMCs maintain a functional cross-talk with the maternal-embryo interface, therefore we speculated the PBMCs may recapitulate the ER stress-UPR profile observed in the pregnant uterus. METHODS: Blood and uterine tissues were obtained from timed pregnant CD-1 mice on gestation day (E)6-19. PBMCs were isolated from heparinized blood by Histopaque-Ficoll density gradient separation. Uterine cytosol and nuclear protein extracts were prepared as described previously 1 . The markers of ERSR were evaluated by immunoblot analysis. RESULTS: Immunoblot analyses revealed that DDIT3, a marker of ER stress response and CASP3 activation maintained a similar gestationally regulated profile in the PBMCs as that observed in the pregnant uterus with dramatic increases found between E6-E13 which declined towards term (E19). Similarly the chaperone protein GRP78 a marker of adaptive UPR was found to increase later in gestation at E12 -E18 in both the pregnant mouse uterus and the circulating PBMC's. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, we have identified a conserved stressresponse in both the isolated PBMC's and gravid uterus across gestation in pregnant mice. We believe that a gestational profile of PBMC-ERSR across gestation might serve as a readout of normal progression of pregnancy and has the potential to act as a potential predictive marker of preterm labor. Acute cAMP elevation has previously been shown to promote relaxation in contracting human myometrium tissue strips in vitro, prompting interest in the use of cAMP agonists in preventing preterm labour. However, we have previously shown cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP) can promote spontaneous contractions after 24 h exposure. We hypothesised 8-Br-cAMP-mediated cAMP elevation promoted contractions due to the absence of P4. METHODS: Myometrial tissue obtained from non-labouring women undergoing caesarean section at term with written consent (n=16) were incubated in serum-free DMEM under tension for 24 h with 1 mM 8-Br-cAMP or H 2 O vehicle and either 10 \u00b5M P4 or ethanol vehicle. Contractile activity (spontaneous and oxytocin-induced, 1 nM), expressed as mean integral tension (MIT), was measured in an isometric organ bath. PKA activity was determined using a Peptag PKA activity assay kit. Western blot determined differences in labour-associated and cAMP signalling protein levels. All data presented represent n=8. Mean \u00b1 SEM data were analysed using Wilcoxon test or paired t-test (significance at P<0.05). RESULTS: 24 h exposure to 8-bromo-cAMP alone increased spontaneous contractions (+850.6 \u00b1 410.7 % vs vehicle, P<0.01) and PKA activity (+102.7 \u00b1 37.8 % vs vehicle, P<0.01). This effect of 8-Br-cAMP on spontaneous contractions was reduced by P4 when it was present both during the 24 h pre-treatment period and in the organ bath (-47.6 \u00b1 12.9 % vs 8-Br-cAMP alone, P<0.05); co-treatment for 24 h alone was not sufficient to block contractions promoted by 8-Br-cAMP. P4 exposure did not alter PKA activity. COX-2 protein abundance was reduced by P4 treatment alone (-24.2 \u00b1 18.2 % vs vehicle) and in co-treatment with 8-Br-cAMP (-36.1 \u00b1 14.2 % vs vehicle), but to only borderline significance (P=0.106 and P=0.055, respectively) in tissues where P4 was present beyond the 24 h incubation period. CONCLUSIONS: P4 reduces 8-Br-cAMP-associated increase in spontaneous contractions but only when constantly present in the extracellular environment and without altering PKA activity. Further studies into the effect of P4 concentration and duration of exposure, as well as its effects on sub-cellular cAMP changes, are needed to determine if P4 and cAMP signalling interact to create the balance between myometrial quiescence and labour onset.",

            "text": "HoxA13 Is a Master Regulator of Regional Gene Expression and Contractile Function in the Pregnant Human Myometrium. INTRODUCTION: Bipedalism, a key evolutionary step that separates humans from most other animal species, results in significant physiologic challenges, particularly with respect to the maintenance of pregnancy and induction of parturition. Thus it was necessary to establish a contracted lower uterine segment (LUS) and a relaxed fundus (FUN) during pregnancy in order to prevent pressure on the cervix from the fetal head, due to gravity. With the onset of labor, this regionalization of myometrial function needed to be reversed, with the FUN becoming contractile and the LUS relaxing to allow descent of the fetus, dilation of the cervix and expulsion of the fetus through the birth canal. We propose that this regionalization of myometrium phenotype requires differential regulation of gene expression in the LUS and FUN. METHODS: RNA sequencing, real-time PCR and immunoblotting, chromatin immunoprecipitation, RNA run-on and in vitro contraction assays were performed. RESULTS: Myometrial cells from LUS and FUN of 6 patients undergoing elective Caesarean section before the onset of labour were cultured for <3 passages. HoxA13, PTGIS and POSTN genes were detected by RNA sequencing to be more highly expressed in LUS than FUN cells. Realtime PCR and immunoblotting assays confirmed LUS cells expressed 5-, 4-and 2-fold HoxA13, PTGIS and POSTN mRNA levels, and 15-, 9-and 4-fold protein levels over FUN cells. HoxA13, PTGIS and POSTN mRNA levels were detected at statistically higher levels in LUS than in FUN of paired term-non-laboring myometrium. HoxA13 induced 8-30 fold increases in PTGIS and POSTN mRNA and protein levels,",

            "text": "while HoxA13 knockdown resulted in 60-70% suppression of PTGIS and POSTN expression in myometrial cells. HoxA13 induced 50-200% increases in Histone3 acetylation in PTGIS and POSTN promoters and thereby induced ~5-fold increases in transcription initiation rates of these genes. Cell contraction assays showed that pre-labor LUS myocytes or HoxA13-overexpressed cells exhibited stronger contraction. CONCLUSIONS: In term-non-labor myometrium, LUS is more contractile and expresses higher levels of PTGIS and POSTN than FUN. This pregnancy-maintaining regionalization of myometrium is medicated by HoxA13. Voltage gated potassium channels play an important role in regulating the transmembrane potential of smooth muscle cells. We have previously report the presence of voltage gated potassium channel family K V 7 in myometrial smooth muscle from pregnant women at term. The aim of this study is to demonstrate functional channels in freshly isolated myometrial smooth muscle cells and to study the effect of channel modulation on the transmembrane potential. METHODS: We obtained, with written consent, myometrial tissue from pregnant women (>37 weeks', n=28) undergoing elective caesarean section. The tissue was enzymatically digested and the cells dislodged by trituration. Conventional whole cell patch clamp was used to study currents. Briefly, a holding potential of -70 mV was applied and the current responses to -70 to +40 mV command potential (1 s) were recorded in the presence and absence of the K V 7 activators retigabine and ML-213 and the K V 7 blocker XE911. For the study of transmembrane potential, whole cell current clamp was employed. Vm was recorded in physiological salt solution and after addition of XE911. RESULTS: Native K V currents were present in 93% of the cells studied. Retigabine (5 \u00b5M) enhanced the voltage activated current amplitude in 21% of cells at +40 mV (614\u00b193 pA retigabine vs 452\u00b181pA control, n=6), whereas addition of the K V 7 channel inhibitor XE911 (10 \u00b5M) partially depressed the current amplitude in 88% of cells tested (239+/-44pA, n=7). Moreover, the K V 7.2 and K V 7.4 activator, ML-213, elicited a current at 510 nM (n=3). The native membrane potential in myometrial smooth muscle cells was -43\u00b11mV. Addition of XE911 (10 \u00b5M) depolarised the membrane to -33\u00b14mV (n=3). CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the presence of functional native K V 7 currents in human myometrial smooth muscle cells. K V 7 activators increase the current amplitudes in some cells, whereas the K V 7 blocker XE911 attenuates them. We speculate that K V 7 currents are basally active and that this could explain the absence of further current activation by retigabine in 79% of all cells. The cell membrane depolarised in response to XE911, in tissue this response would lead to smooth muscle contraction, supporting our hypothesis that K V 7 channels are potential tocolytic targets. Human uterus undergoes distinct molecular and functional changes during pregnancy and parturition. Our previous study has shown that human myometrium expresses cystathionine-\u03b3-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine-\u03b2-synthetase (CBS), the principal enzymes responsible for hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) generation, and therefore produces H 2 S. The expression levels of CSE and CBS in pregnant myometrium are down-regulated after onset of labour. We hypothesized that H 2 S might be involved in the transformation of uterus from quiescent state to contractile state during pregnancy. METHODS: The myometrial tissues were obtained from pregnant women who were in labor (TL) or not in labor (TNL) at term. The output of cytokines was determined by ELISA. Western blot analysis was used to determine the levels of uterine activation proteins (UAPs). Uterine smooth muscle cells (USMCs) were isolated from TNL myomtrium tissues and cultured in vitro.",

H 2 S donor NaHS and H 2 S precursor L-cysteine inhibited the expression of CX43, OTR, PTGS2 and PTGFR in cultured USMCs in dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. H 2 S also dose-dependently suppressed IL1, IL6 and TNFa output, while IL1, IL6 and TNFa increased the expression of UAPs including CX43, OTR, PTGS2 and PTGFR. The effects of L-cysteine were not occurred in the cells transfected with CSE and CBS siRNA. Glibenclamide, an inhibitor of ATP-sensitive potassium (K ATP ) channels, reversed the effects of H 2 S on UAPs and cytokines. H 2 S activated PI3K and ERK1/2 signaling whereas inhibited NF-\u03baB signaling via K ATP channels pathway. Blockage of PI3K and ERK1/2 signaling reversed the effects of H 2 S. CONCLUSIONS: H 2 S generated via CSE and CBS suppresses inflammation and expression UAPs in human pregnant myometrium. The effects of H 2 S is mediated by K ATP channels and dependent on NF-\u03baB, PI3K and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. H 2 S produced within myometrium contributes to maintenance of quiescent state of uterus during pregnancy.",

            "text": "INTRODUCTION: Proper regulation of uterine contractility is essential for a successful pregnancy. Uterine contractions are directly controlled by the membrane potential of myometrial smooth muscle cells (MSMCs). Depolarization of the MSMC resting membrane potential (RMP) induces activation of Ca 2+ channels, action potential generation, and influx of Ca 2+ resulting in the activation of contractile machinery. Throughout pregnancy the RMP of MSMCs becomes more depolarized as the uterus transitions to a more contractile state. MSMC RMP is modulated by the pregnancy hormones estrogen and progesterone. However, the mechanism by which these pregnancy hormones modulate RMP is unknown. Previously, we have identified expression and activity of a Na + leak channel (NALCN) in human MSMCs. NALCN is known to reduce the RMP in other tissue types. We hypothesized that estrogen and progesterone may modulate MSMC RMP by regulating NALCN expression throughout pregnancy. METHODS: NALCN expression was measured in the mouse uterus by immunoblot, and in the human uterus by qRT-PCR. Additionally, the effects of estrogen and progesterone on NALCN expression was assessed by treating cultured human MSMCs with these hormones, and assaying NALCN expression by immunoblot. RESULTS: In the mouse uterus, NALCN protein expression decreased mid-pregnancy (days 14 -18) and increased near parturition (day 19). Furthermore, NALCN mRNA expression in human uterine tissue was higher in laboring samples compared to non-laboring samples, correlating with the previously described decrease in the RMP. Additionally, treatment of cultured human MSMCs with pregnancy hormones showed a modulation of NALCN expression. CONCLUSIONS: NALCN expression is regulated by pregnancy through the effects of estrogen and progesterone, and may serve as the mechanism by which these hormones affect myometrial membrane potential.",

            "text": "Oksana Shynlova, 1,2 Anna Dorogin, 1 Xuesen Dong, 3 Stephen Lye. The molecular mechanisms regulating preparation of the uterus for labor are not fully understood. We have previously reported that mechanical stretch of the uterine wall by the growing fetus plays a direct role in the regulation of major components of the extracellular matrix in late pregnant rat myometrium. As was shown by others, periostin (POSTN), a matricellular protein involved in the process of fibrosis and myofibroblast differentiation, is expressed in tissues subjected to mechanical stress. However, the expression of POSTN in human or animal myometrium during gestation and its response to uterine stretch has not yet been investigated. METHODS: Using (1) primary human myometrial cells (HMCs) derived from the lower uterine segment (LUS) and fundus (F), (2) human myometrium collected before and during labour from LUS and (3) a unilaterally tubal-ligated rat model in combination with Real-time PCR, immunoblot and immunohistochemical staining, we examined gestational variations and the effect of mechanical stretch on POSTN expression. RESULTS: Using HMCs, we found that under control conditions POSTN mRNA and protein levels in cells derived from LUS were higher as compared to cells from F of the same term non-laboring patient. When cells from LUS were subjected to static mechanical stretch for 24 hs, POSTN transcript levels were significantly up-regulated but only in HMCs also expressing high levels of desmin, a marker of muscle cell terminal differentiation. Cells derived from F did not react to mechanical stretch. In rat myometrium expression of the POSTN gene was significantly upregulated at late gestation (day 17-21) and during term labour (day 23) as compared to early gestation. Importantly, most changes in POSTN gene expression occurred specifically in the gravid horn but not in the empty horn of unilaterally pregnant rats, indicating the effect of gravidity. Immunostaining for POSTN was highly elevated in both muscle layers of late pregnant rat myometrium compared to early gestation and was more pronounced in the gravid uterine horn. CONCLUSIONS: We identified the differential expression of POSTN by HMCs in the uterine F vs LUS and established its spatiotemporal expression patterns in the pregnant rat myometrium, but its function during gestation is largely unknown. Additional studies are in progress to examine the role of POSTN in myometrial differentiation. The association between antenatal infection and preterm labor is widely accepted. However, little is known about the intracellular calcium regulation in uterine smooth muscle which is a key component of contractility. Here, we hypothesize that bacterial endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1, alter calcium homeostatic mechanisms and may, in turn, augment myometrial contractility. METHODS: Primary uterine smooth muscle cells (UtSMCs; prepared by nonezymatic dispersion from a nonpregnant donor) were obtained from Lonza (USA). Cells were grown to 80% confluence and then serum starved for 24 hours prior to exposure. UtSMCs were then treated with LPS (1 mcg/ml), IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) for 48 hours. Intracellular Ca 2+ ([Ca 2+ ] i ) responses to oxytocin (500 nM), was measured in UtSMCs loaded with the Ca 2+ indicator fura-2 and perfused with Hank's balanced salt solution containing 2 mM extracellular Ca 2+ . Additionally, expression of calcium regulatory proteins in cytokine exposed UtSMCs was assessed by western blot analysis.",

            "text": "In untreated UtSMCs, oxytocin acutely elevates peak [Ca 2+ ] i response and is followed by decay. Cells exposed to pro-inflammatory cytokines had a significantly increased peak [Ca 2+ ] i response to oxytocin when compared to untreated cells. Additionally, pro-inflammatory cytokines appeared to slow decay of the [Ca 2+ ] i response to baseline, indicating reduced sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA2) function. Western blot analysis showed increased expression of calcium regulatory proteins such as transient receptor potential cation channel 3 (TRPC3), stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), SERCA2 and phospholamban in UtSMCs treated with cytokines. Notably, SERCA2/ phospholamban ratio is decreased, reflecting decreased SERCA2 function. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the altered intracellular calcium regulation in UtSMCs in response to inflammation. This is an important mechanism in the cascade of events leading to dysfunctional contractility in antenatal infection-related preterm labor. The switch from a quiescent phenotype to a contractile state during pregnancy likely involves the integration of multiple signaling networks generated from both hormonal and mechanical signals. Identifying how these networks change and interact is crucial to understanding the biochemical processes involved in the induction of labor. We have conducted global phosphoproteomic studies to identify and quantitate the specific phosphorylation changes that occur in pregnant human myometrial cells in response to acute progesterone and/ or mechanical stretch. METHODS: 18% biaxial stretch experiment were performed in the presence or absence of 600 nM acute progesterone treatment to elucidate signaling pathways activated by hormonal and mechanical distention in pregnant human uterine smooth muscle cells. Protein samples were extracted and prepared for mass spectrometry based analysis. Samples were digested with a trypsin/Lys-C mixture and phosphopeptides were enriched using immobilized metal affinity columns. Enriched samples were differentially TMT labeled and quantitated using reverse phase liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Biaxial stretch of human uterine smooth muscle cells confirmed an increase in phosphorylation of ERK2, as well as revealed changes in the upstream signaling molecules MEK, and the ERK scaffolding protein AHNAK. We observed a statistically significant increase in phosphorylation of AHNAK at Serine 4890 and Serine 5752. These sites have been shown in other smooth muscle models to be regulated by CDK5 and involved in shifts of phenotype and cell cycle regulation. CONCLUSIONS: Identifying the global signaling changes and interactions that occur in response to myometrial stretch will improve our understanding the biochemical processes involved in the induction of term and preterm labor. Future work will focus on confirming the stretched induced phosphorylation changes in ERK and AHNAK signaling networks. We have shown that H 2 S is a potent channel-independent uterine tocolytic. To define its mechanism further, we hypothesized that H 2 S reduces intracellular Ca 2+ and P-MLC. We performed pharmacologic studies to discern H 2 S signaling in primary myometrial cells (PMCs) in vitro and uterine smooth muscle (USM) strips in physiologic organ bath.",

Obstetrics and Gynecology, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA. INTRODUCTION: Hemorrhage is the second leading cause of maternal mortality in the United States and is most often due to atony. Cesarean section increases the risk of hemorrhage and introduces the possibility of occult intra-abdominal bleeding. Focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) scans are used in the trauma setting to assess for intraabdominal bleeding to triage patients for immediate surgical intervention. But unlike trauma patients, stable post-operative patients have been noted to have intra-abdominal fluid on CT studies. If seen on ultrasound (US), there is no known baseline for how much fluid is normal. The purpose of this study is to evaluate how much fluid can be seen on a FAST scan in a stable patient after a non-emergent c-section. METHODS: This prospective observational study was approved by the Institutional Review Board. Patients were approached while waiting for non-emergent c-sections. In recovery, a modified FAST scan was performed by 1 of 3 trained providers. The scan included a right upper quadrant (RUQ) view of the liver and kidney, a left upper quadrant (LUQ) view of the spleen and kidney, and a pelvic view from above the surgical bandage. A scan was considered positive if any echolucent fluid was visualized, and each view was noted separately. Patient demographic, operative and post-operative information were gathered from electronic medical records. RESULTS: One hundred patients underwent the modified FAST scan. Sixty-five patients (65%) were scheduled repeat cesareans, 22 (22%) were breech, and 13 (13%) had another indication for c-section (5 elective, 3 prior myomectomy, 2 macrosomia, 2 placenta previa and 1 obstructing fibroids). Average operative estimated blood loss was 787 mL \u00b1 328. The mean time of the scan was 73 \u00b1 36 minutes after the end of surgery. Ninety-eight (98%) of the RUQ scans were negative, 1 (1%) positive and 1 (1%) inconclusive. Ninety-six (96%) of LUQ scans were negative and 4 (4%) were inconclusive. All suprapubic scans were inconclusive due to the enlarged postpartum uterus. CONCLUSIONS: In our series of stable patients after c-section, US was feasible in 97.5% of upper quadrant scans and overwhelmingly negative. Upper abdominal fluid seen on US in a patient with signs of bleeding cannot be dismissed as normal post-operative fluid, and intra-abdominal bleeding must be seriously considered. . Whether melatonin has protective effects on the fetus independent of placental effects in risky development is unknown. Here, we isolated the direct effects of melatonin on fetal cardiac structure and function during chronic hypoxia in the chick embryo, the only model that permits direct investigation of the fetus independent of effects on the maternal and placental physiology. METHODS: Fertilised eggs incubated under normoxia or hypoxia (14% O 2 ) from day 0 were treated with melatonin (1 mg.kg -1 ) or saline vehicle +/-luzindole (non-selective melatonin receptor antagonist, 10 uM) from day 13 of incubation (equivalent to ca. 25 wks of human pregnancy). At day 19, the embryo was euthanised by spinal transection. Cardiac function was assessed in a Langendorff preparation. A separate cohort of animals was perfusion fixed (4% paraformaldehyde at 2.66kPa). The presence of significant omphaloceles is considered by some as a contraindication to vaginal delivery. We sought to evaluate the impact of the delivery method in cases of known fetal omphaloceles at our institution and to evaluate the effect of delivery method on neonatal outcomes. METHODS: We reviewed all cases at a single academic institution from 2002-2014 of sonographically diagnosed fetal omphaloceles that ended in delivery of a viable neonate with omphalocele confirmed at time of delivery. We evaluated route of delivery, as well as neonatal outcomes including omphalocele repair, associated fetal anomalies, and NICU course. RESULTS: A total of 34 cases are included in our analysis. Of these 34 cases, 16 underwent a trial of labor and 10 delivered vaginally. Of the 10 delivered vaginally, 4 were reported giant omphaloceles wth a significant portion of fetal liver outside of the fetal abdomen. Indications for cesarean delivery in those that labored included non-reassuring fetal status (3) and arrest of labor (3). Scheduled cesarean delivery was performed in the other 18 cases. Of these, 12 of these were for routine obstetric indications including repeat elective cesarean delivery, malpresentaton, and placenta previa. Notably, 6 cases were cesarean deliveries with the specified indication being the presence of a fetal omphalocele, including one classical cesarean delivery. Associated genetic and fetal anomalies were seen in a number of cases. There was no evidence of neonatal CONCLUSIONS: Many extremely preterm infants develop severe morbidity. Understanding how maternal hypertension influences outcome can aid in counseling families of extremely preterm infants. We started the fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring network system in our region. We have 7 primary and 2 secondarylevel institutions where 3000 women deliver every year. This system enables the attending physicians at secondary institutions to evaluate multiple intrapartum FHR monitorings simultaneously from the primary institutions. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of this system on perinatal outcome. METHODS: The FHR monitoring network system started in July 2012. We collected data from January 2011 to June 2012 (period 1) and from July 2012 to December 2013 (period 2) in all the 9 institutions. We compared the incidence of low umbilical blood pH (<7.10) or intrapartum fetal death (FD), and of cesarean section due to non-reassuring FHR between 2 periods. Fetal asphyxia not preventable with FHR were excluded. RESULTS: We had 4250 deliveries in period 1 and 4886 in period 2. Incidence of low pH or FD was 13 and 11, and of cesarean section was 260(6.1%) and 265(5.4%), which did not reach statistically significant. However, in 3 primary institutions that use the network more frequently (>15%), incidence of low pH or FD decreased from 9 to 2 (p<0.03), while the cesarean section rate did not change. CONCLUSIONS: FHR monitoring network system could reduce the incidence of fetal acidemia without increasing cesarean section rate. Although neonatal encephalopathy (NE) due to perinatal asphyxia accounts for a notable proportion of brain injury and poor neurodevelopmental outcome (NDO), the causal pathway remains largely unexplained, and the contribution of the placenta and its associated histopathology is unclear. We sought to examine the histologic changes that occur in the placenta of neonates with NE and relate this to NDO METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of neonates \u00b336wks gestation born at Parkland Hospital from 01/2006-11/2011 with NE. Umbilical artery blood gases were examined and placental histology reviewed and validated by a Pediatric pathologist blinded to clinical outcomes (Placenta. Apr 2005;26:S114-S117). Abnormal NDO was defined as death or Bayley III score <85 at 18-24 mon of age. RESULTS: 120 of 86,274 neonates (1.4/1000 LB) \u00b336wks gestation had perinatal acidosis and NE as determined by standardized neurological examination. 47 had mild NE and received no treatment, while 73 had moderate (n=70, 96%) or severe (n=3, 4%) NE and received systemic hypothermia therapy. 9 (12%) neonates died. All survivors receiving hypothermia had a Bayley III assessment at 22\u00b17(SD) mon of age. The presence of \"significant\" placental pathology, chorioamnionitis with or without fetal response, and patchy/diffuse chronic villitis were independently associated with the severity of NE (P<0.001). Univariate logistic regression revealed that only \"significant\" placental pathology (OR 3.5, 95% CI:1.1-11.4), and specifically, patchy/diffuse chronic villitis (OR 9.29, 95% CI:1.11, 77.73), predicted abnormal NDO. CONCLUSIONS: 'Significant' placental pathology is associated with the severity of NE and abnormal NDO in neonates receiving systemic hypothermia, suggesting the placenta might contribute to the inflammatory response seen with NE, modify placental perfusion or mirror the inflammatory changes in the brain, resulting in abnormal NDO.",

INTRODUCTION: There are few reports regarding the impact of obesity on outcomes of trial of labor after cesarean section (TOLAC). Most of the available reports took place, when prostaglandins were still routinely used to induce women attempting TOLAC. Therefore, we provide an updated evaluation on the outcomes of TOLAC among obese women using a more recent database. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort analysis using the Texas vital records database from 2006 -2011. We categorized pre-pregnancy BMI according to WHO guidelines. Analysis was limited to obese women (BMI\u00b330) with non-anomalous pregnancies that delivered between 24 and 42 weeks gestation who had reported one or two prior cesarean deliveries. We compared social-demographic information between women who attempted TOLAC versus elective cesarean delivery (ECD). Logistic regression was used to estimate the risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes between the two comparison groups stratified by obesity class. The results were corrected for possible confounding variables. RESULTS: A total of 91,376 deliveries were included in the analysis. The overall rate of TOLAC was 10%. The mean age at delivery was similar between TOLAC and ECD group at 38 weeks. Minority women and women with lower education are more likely to attempt TOLAC. Among women in the TOLAC group, the cesarean delivery rate was higher for women with severe obesity. However, there are no significant differences in adverse maternal outcomes between TOLAC and ECD groups for all BMI categories, including risk for transfusion, ICU admission, unplanned operations or hysterectomy. TOLAC increases the risk of low 5 and 10 minute APGAR scores among all neonates, except those born to class III obese women. The risk of neonatal death is 2.6 times higher among class II obese women in the TOLAC group compared to ECD group. However this effect was not appreciated for class I or class III group and may be due to random variation. The overall neonatal composite score was not different between the two groups for all obesity classes. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity does not appear to increase the risks associated with TOLAC compared to ECD except for low 5 and 10 minute APGARs. In the 10 years since Hibbard et al published their findings of the risks of TOLAC among obese women using data collected prior to 2002, new management guidelines may have improved maternal and neonatal outcomes among this group of women. This is a study using a population based database, further studies are required to confirm these findings.",

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of all patients who presented with twin gestations between 2005-2013 to a single obstetrical practice was performed. Patients who were diagnosed with hypothyroidism prior to pregnancy were identified. Patients were followed with serial thyroid function tests and treated appropriately. The rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes were compared between patients with and without hypothyroidism with p<0.05 used for significance.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional analysis of an observational cohort study of 141 pregnant women enrolled between August 2013 and July 2014 from an urban obstetrics practice with a large immigrant population. Women with a history of a positive TST result were excluded. Demographic and clinical risk factors for tuberculosis were assessed. Enrolled women underwent a T-SPOT.TB test (Marlborough; Oxford Immunotec) and placement of TST (Toronto; Sanofi Pasteur). Participants were instructed to return in 48-72 hours for TST interpretation. We calculated the completion rate and frequency of a positive result for each test, as well as the concordance between the T-SPOT.TB and TST using the kappa statistic.

RESULTS: Both the neonatal mice and the stillborn baby showed pulmonary hemorrhage and filamentous bacteria in the airway. Infant mice exposed to F. nucleatum in utero demonstrated lung inflammation and impaired lung development. The lung inflammation was characterized by patchy distributions of thickened alveolar septa, which were 43% thicker than those of the saline-control mice, and accompanied by increased cell infiltrates, which were positive for leukocyte common antigen. Furthermore, 29% of infant mice exposed to F. nucleatum showed impaired lung development, with alveolar numbers decreased by 39% and pulmonary vascular density decreased by 30% as compared to the saline control. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that transplacental F. nucleatum infection causes neonatal lung injury and results in chronic lung disease during infancy in our murine model.These results suggest transplacental F. nucleatum infection may be a previously unrecognized but potentially treatable cause of chronic lung disease in preterm infants. Augmentation of labor was associated with bacteremia (aOR 2.11, CI 1.11-4.03, p=0.02) while amniotomy appeared to be protective (aOR 0.57, CI 0.35-0.92, p=0.02). Hospitalization for more than 1 day prior to delivery also predicted bacteremia (aOR 2.05, CI 1.07-3.95) *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: When considering a variety of demographic and clinical variables, fever during labor and hospitalization for greater than one day are associated with an increased risk of bacteremia. Ensuring blood cultures are obtained on women with fevers during labor or those admitted more than 24 hours prior to delivery could maximize identification of mothers at risk for sepsis and potentially severe morbidity due to bacteremia. RESULTS: HCMV infection triggered a rapid immune activation in the decidua, significantly affecting decidual cytokine -chemokine expression pattern, with predominant induction of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and IP-10. Decidual tissue innate response was induced early upon virustissue contact by a conserved structural virion component, and was not affected by neutralizing HCMV antibodies. Of note, IFN-\u03b3 induction was distinctive to the decidual tissue, and was not observed in concomitantlyinfected placental villi. Importantly, functional analysis of conditioned media recovered from infected tissues revealed the direct effect of the viral-induced decidual environment on antiviral protection along with leukocyte attraction and induction of apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: These studies, in a clinically-relevant surrogate human model, provide a novel insight into the first-line tissue response, mediating both protection and damage in the maternal-fetal interface, which could determine the outcome of infection.",

Two male and two female WT offspring were kept from each mother and half of these offspring were placed on a high fat diet (HFD) at 20 weeks of age. Offspring were weighed weekly and sacrificed at 6.5 months of age. Glucose tolerance, heart lipid accumulation, fibrosis and cardiac gene expression were evaluated in all offspring. Blood pressure, vascular function, and pancreatic vascularization were evaluated in male offspring from WT and db/+ mothers. RESULTS: Offspring from db/+ mothers weighed less (p<0.05) than WT offspring on both a normal and HFD. This effect continued in offspring from leptin treated mothers compared to saline treated mothers but was less pronounced. Offspring from db/+ mothers had better (p<0.05) glucose tolerance than WT offspring on a normal diet, though this difference was completely lost on a HFD. There were no differences in heart lipid accumulation or fibrosis. Cardiac gene expression was not altered forGlut4, Fabp3, Pgc1\u03b1 and Insr. No differences were found in blood pressure or vascular vasoconstriction. There was no significant difference in vasodilation on a normal diet, though male offspring from db/+ mothers, were if anything, more responsive (p= 0.08) to insulin. Analysis of pancreatic vascularization is ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that a high maternal leptin environment does not cause the obesity and CVD observed in offspring of GDM pregnancies, and may even protect offspring from damaging effects of a GDM environment.

(PCBs) are environmental contaminants which impart detrimental metabolic health consequences on exposed individuals. Further, PCBs are lipophilic and stable, which permits placental transfer to fetuses of exposed mothers. The liver is the main site of detoxification of PCBs so we set out to measure hepatic gene expression in pregnant ICR(CD1) mice exposed to PCBs, as well as their offspring. METHODS: Female mice were gavaged once every other week with 1 \u00b5mole/kg PCB 126 or vehicle beginning at mating. In one cohort, mice were sacrificed and fetuses removed on embryonic day 18. In the second cohort offspring were aged to 4 months prior to tissue collection. Livers were extracted from dams, fetuses, and offspring and snap frozen. RNA was isolated and analyzed via Nanostring Technology for cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (Cyp1a1) and cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily B, polypeptide 1 (Cyp1b1) (metabolize PCBs and upstream markers of oxidative stress production), NAD(P) H dehydrogenase [quinone] 1 (NQO1) and nuclear factor (erythroidderived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) (antioxidant response), and autophagy-related protein 7 (Atg7) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) (markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress). Student's t-test was used to analyze data between maternal PCB exposure and control mice. RESULTS: Dams and cesarean pups exposed to PCBs displayed increased Cyp1a1, Cyp1b1, NQO1, and Nrf2 (p<0.05) compared to those exposed to vehicle. Interestingly, 4 month old offspring had no measurable PCBs in liver; however these mice displayed increased expression of CYP1a1, Atg7, and CHOP (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence for early deleterious effects of maternal PCB exposure on fetus and offspring hepatic gene expression. Further, persistent elevation of Cyp1a1 in 4 month offspring is suggestive of epigenetic changes to PCB exposure in utero and future studies will be aimed at examining these alterations. ",

To test associations between fetal gender and fetal circulation measurements linear regression models were used adjusting for fetal weight, gestational age and fetal heart rate. RESULTS: A higher pulsatility index of the ductus venosus was observed in male fetuses compared to female fetuses with a lower E/A ratio of the tricuspid and bicuspid valves. This was mainly determined by significant differences in the E wave of the tricuspid and bicuspid valves. A lower peak systolic velocity was seen of the pulmonary artery with a similar trend regarding peak systolic velocity of the aorta ascendens when comparing male fetuses to female fetuses. CONCLUSIONS: Male fetuses exhibit a higher afterload and higher enddiastolic preload compared to female fetuses. This is in agreement with a higher systemic blood pressure. Both cardiac and arterial compliance are reduced in male fetuses, consistent with a stiffer arterial vasculature and less elastic heart. These results might be related to gender specific differences in CVD in adulthood.

Contrary to the situation in RPTC from males, there was no effect of Beta exposure on the slopes of the Na + uptake lines in RPTC from females after SNP or cGMP stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that there are sex differences in in the effects of prenatal steroid exposure on responses to SNP and cGMP-induced inhibition of Na + uptakeby RPTC. The inhibition of Na + uptake is suppressed to an equal degree in cells from female beta exposed animals but inhibition of uptake is greatly reduced in cells from Beta exposed males.

Here, we aimt to study in mice the interactions between obesity in pregnant dams, and MET treatment on placental expression of selected inflammatory genes important in the placental response to lipids. METHODS: Female C57/BL6J mice were fed control diet (C, 7% kcal fat) or high-fat diet (HF, 45% kcal fat) 6 weeks prior to mating through pregnancy. A subset of pregnant C and HF dams were given MET in drinking water (250mg/kg bodyweight/day) throughout pregnancy, generating 4 dam groups: C diet without treatment (C), C diet with metformin (C+MET), HF diet without treatment (HF) and HF diet with metformin (HF+MET). Dams were killed on day 16 of pregnancy and the placentas were collected. RNA was extracted from the placentas and converted to cDNA. Expression of inflammatory genes interleukin-1 beta (IL-1b), tumour necrosis factor (TNF), chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL-2) and Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 (TLR-2 and TLR-4) was measured using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Mean differences between groups were assessed by one-way ANOVA. RESULTS: Feeding a HF diet 6 weeks preconception resulted in dams that were heavier and fatter at the time of pregnancy vs C-fed animals. The obese condition resulted in increased mRNA expression of CCL-2 in the HF dams vs C dams irrespective of MET treatment (P=0.004). Further, MET treatment was associated with increased IL-1b expression (P=0.043) in the HF+MET and C+MET dams vs corresponding HF and C dams. Likewise, TNF-a mRNA expression (P=0.034) increased in the HF+MET vs HF but not in the C-fed dams. No effects of both the HF diet and MET were found on placental expression of TLR-2 and TLR-4. CONCLUSIONS: Both HF diet induced obesity in pregnant mouse dams and MET treatment modulate the expression of certain inflammatory genes in the placenta, indicating interactions between the maternal environment and the placental inflammatory response.",

Impaired Titin function causes diastolic dysfunction associated with preserved ejection fraction a common cause of heart failure. We hypothesized that IUGR results in development of hearts with less contractile power due to decrease in the N2B isoform. We determined the effect of IUGR on the isoform mRNA ratio and mRNA and protein for RBM20. IUGR decreased the percentage N2B and RBM 20 mRNA and protein (Fig 1) CONCLUSIONS: The N2B titin isoform decreases associated with decreased RBM20 in IUGR left atria. N2B is expressed less in the systolic failing heart and recent studies have shown less RBM20 in patients with end-stage heart failure. We hypothesize that decreased contractile strength in the hearts of IUGR offspring would predispose to cardiac dysfunction. We propose to examine abundance of N2B, N2BA and RBM20 in all four heart chambers at different stages of gestation. NICHD HD21350 We have shown that maternal low protein in P and/or lactation (L) affect adult male rat risk assessment behavior (1) potentially related to increased maternal reactive oxygen species (ROS). We hypothesized that maternal treatment with the antioxidant Res in P and L improves OFF anxiety behavior. METHODS: Pregnant Wistar rats, were assigned to Control (C-20% casein) or a restricted (R-10% casein) isocaloric diet in P and L. Half C and R mothers received 20 mg/kg Res orally in P and L (Cres and Rres). Litters were adjusted to 12 pups. From postnatal day (PND) 21 male pups were fed with C diet until the end of the experiment. At PND 106 -107, eight male OFF were tested in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and Open Field and activity recorded by video analysis. At PND 110 serum corticosterone and ACTH were determined and amygdala obtained to quantify Malondialdehyde (MDA-spectrophotometry). Analysis by ANOVA. RESULTS: R male OFF made fewer open arm and center zone entries vs C and, both entries increased in Rres (Fig 1A and B) . Serum corticosterone and ACTH were higher in R vs C, and decreased in Rres (Fig 1C and D) . MDA amygdala was similar among groups ( Fig 1E) . (MLP) in P and L impairs OFF associative learning and motivation. Increased OS may play a key role in these negative outcomes. We hypothesized that maternal anti-oxidant treatment with res in P and L improves OFF spacial learning and memory. METHODS: Pregnant Wistar rats, ate Control (C-20% casein) or restricted (R-10% casein) isocaloric diet in P and L. Half C and R mother received 20 mg/kg Res orally in P and L (Cres and Rres). At 19 days gestation (dG), half of mothers were euthanized to obtain fetal brain and determine fetal brain malondialdehyde (MDA). Remaining rats delivered at term. From postnatal day (PND) 21 male pups were fed C diet until the end of the experiment. At PND 108, eight male OFF were tested in the Morris water maze (MWM). RESULTS: At 19dG, male fetal brain MDA was higher in R and lower in Cres and Rres vs C. After 24 h of learning (spatial memory) the escape latency to locate the target platform was higher in R vs C; however the latency decreased in Rres. Number of entries, time spent and distance recovered into target zone were lower in R OFF (Fig 1C, D, E) ; Rres increased entries and target area time spent. Total distance was similar among groups. *Figure(s) will be available online. Fig1. A) Fetal brain MDA at 19dG; MWM test: B) Latency (sec) to locate platform area, C) number of entries, D) time spent and E) distance recovered into target zone during 24h retention test. M \u00b1 SEM, n=8 from different litters; p<0.05 * vs C, different letter for R vs Rres and C vs Cres. CONCLUSIONS: Res improved markers of learning and spatial memory, as well as oxidative damage indicating a correlation between MLP induced adverse outcomes behavior and brain ROS. As the prevalence of obesity among pregnant women continues to rise, an increasing number of children are exposed to an 'obese intrauterine environment'. Maternal obesity increases the risk of offspring obesity, due in part to altered development of appetite regulatory neurons in hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC). The ARC contains two populations of neurons, derived from neural stem cell (NSC) progenitors, which have opposing actions on food intake: orexigenic (AgRP; agouti-related protein) and anorexigenic (POMC; proopiomelanocortin). The development of these neurons from is regulated by bHLH neuroproliferative factor (Hes1) which promotes NSC proliferation and inhibits downstream bHLH neurodifferentiation factors (Mash1, Ngn3). Ngn3 further promotes the development of anorexigenic POMC neurons, while inhibiting AgRP expression. We hypothesized that (1) maternal obesity impacts fetal hypothalamic ARC development, increasing expression of appetite (AgRP) versus satiety (POMC) neurons, and (2) these changes are mediated by Hes1 and Mash1/Ngn3. METHODS: Female mice were fed either control (10% k/cal) or high fat (45% k/cal) diet to create maternal obesity (MO) prior to mating. Diets continued throughout pregnancy and lactation. Newborns were delivered spontaneously, males sacrificed at day one of life, and brains collected. Hypothalamus was dissected and protein expression analyzed (Western Blot) for Hes1 (neuroproliferation), Mash1 and Ngn3 (neurodifferentiation), and AgRP and POMC expression. RESULTS: At 1 day of age, MO males were heavier (1.55\u00b10.09 vs 1.31\u00b10.01 g; P<0.05) than Controls. MO males had decreased hypothalamic expression of Hes1 (0.6-fold; P<0.05) and Ngn3 (0.8-fold; P<0.05) with increased expression of Mash1 (2.8-fold; P<0.05). Consistent with these changes, expression of AgRP was increased (1.5-fold; P<0.05) and POMC was reduced (0.7-fold; P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MO offspring appetite regulation is biased toward orexigenic, and away from anorexigenic neurons, resulting in excess appetite, reduced satiety and development of obesity. The putative underlying mechanism involves reduced Hes1, which promotes premature neuronal differentiation as evident by increased Mash1. Reduced Ngn3 expression impairs anorexigenic POMC neuronal development, resulting in increased AgRP expression. Early modifications of the maternal nutrient environment may prevent altered development of appetite regulation. Among them, stress has been linked to increased risk of emotional and behavioral disorders such as depression in offspring, which was likely mediated by glucocorticoids (GCs).",

            "text": "Pregnant rats were exposed to dexamethasone (DEX) (0.1 mg/kg/day) in the last week of pregnancy. The behavior of offspring was assessed at 9 weeks after birth. Some offspring was mated to produce a second generation. Hippocampus of offspring was collected for determining the expression of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), CRH receptors (CRHRs) and methylation status of CRH and CRHR1. The effects of GCs on CRH and CRHR1 were confirmed in the model of cultured hippocampal slices in vitro. RESULTS: Prenatal DEX exposure induced depression-like behavior and increased the expression of CRH and CRHR1 but not CRHR2 in hippocampus. Intrahippocampal administration of CRHR1 antagonist antalarmin alleviated depression-like behavior in offspring upon prenatal DEX exposure. Intrahippocampal injection of lentiviral vectors expressing CRHR1 in adult rats resulted in depression-like behavior, confirming that increased CRHR1 expression would lead to depressionlike behavior. Prenatal DEX exposure decreased global methylation and caused demethylation at several CpG sites of CRHR1 promoter, but did not affect the methylation status of CRH promoter in hippocampus. In the model of cultured hippocampal slices, either DEX or corticosterone treatment caused an increase in CRH and CRHR1 expression. The stimulatory effects of GCs on CRHR1 expression was reversed by DNA methyltransferase agonist and DNA methyltransferase agonist decreased CRHR1 expression in cultured hippocampal slices. Furthermore, we found that increased depression-like behavior and expression of hippocampal CRH and CRHR1 as well as DNA global demethylation were also evident in the second generation offsping who was delivered by prenatal DEXexposed female offspring. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal DEX exposure results in persistent changes in both depression-like behavior and hippocampal CRH and CRHR1 expression, which can be transmitted to the next generation mainly through maternal line. The depression-like behavior induced by prenatal DEX exposure is at least in part mediated by increased CRH and CRHR1 expression in hippocampus and epigenetic mechanism is involved in CRHR1 expression.",

            "text": "Expression and Characterization of TRPV1 in Healthy Versus Diseased Fallopian Tubes. Lindsey Borgia, 1 Deborah Tinnemore, 2 Richard Burney, 1,2 Avedis Kazanjian. The complex molecular landscape of this microenvironment is not well understood. Transient Receptor Protein Subfamily V Member 1 (TRPV1) is a cation channel activated by a wide variety of stimuli and implicated in numerous biological processes throughout the body. Our objective was to characterize expression of TRPV1 in healthy and diseased fallopian tube. METHODS: Mid-isthmic oviductal segments were obtained at the time of laparoscopic tubal sterilization from twenty-two women. Tubal segments were processed for quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to measure gene expression and localize protein expression. Archival smaples from patients with hydrosalpinx were utilized for protein expression with IHC. RESULTS: TRPV1 mRNA expression was unchanged between the different phases of the menstural cycle in healthy fallopian tubes. IHC analysis of protein expression in the tubal epithelium demonstrated similar levels in both secretory and ciliated cells. Intrestingly, a marked increased in protein expression was observed in tubal peg cells. Protein expression was maintained in hydrosalpinx with loss of distinct expression patterns compared to healthy epithelium. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of the expression pattern of TRPV1 in the fallopian tube and provides a basis for the study of dysregulation in pathologic conditions such as hydrosalpinx. The hormone independent expression of TRPV1 in the luminal epithelium with increased expression in peg cells suggests a potential role in secretory activity and anterograde transport. Further studies are needed to examine the significance surrounding the loss of marked expression of TRPV1 in peg cells in the setting of hydrosalpinx. , and intermedin (IMD), play significant roles in facilitating pregnancy-associated vascular adaptation. CGRP, AM, and IMD share common receptor components-calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) and receptor activity modifying protein (RAMP) 1, 2 and 3 in different combination in exerting their biological functions: CRLR-RAMP1 for CGRP, RAMP2 and 3 for AM, and all three for IMD. The present study was designed to determine the proximity association of CRLR with RAMPs and the influence of CGRP family peptides on the interactions of the receptor components on the cell surface of rat mesenteric artery smooth muscle cells (RMASMCs). METHODS: RMASMCs were grown on Lab Tek chamber slides, and treated (2 minutes) with CGRP, AM, and IMD at the concentration of 10nM. Proximity ligation assay (PLA) was performed by using a DuolinkII Fluoresence kit (Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fixed cells were incubated with primary antibodies to CRLR in combination with RAMP1, 2, or 3, PLA probes, followed by ligation and amplification of the PLA probe. The images were observed under fluorescence microscope and the red spots were counted using Cellsense Digital Imaging software in 3 -5 randomly selected fields. RESULTS: (1) Using PLA technology, we demonstrated that RAMP1, 2, and 3 are each closely associated with CRLR on the cell surface of RMASM cells; and no significant differences were noted in their basal association.(2) CGRP treatment stimulates the complex formation of CRLR with RAMP1 (p=0.0052) and RAMP2 but not with RAMP3 when compared to controls; AM increases the complex formation of CRLR with RAMP3 (p=0.0045) but not with RAMP1 or 2, when compared with controls; and IMD enhances the complex formation of CRLR with RAMP1 and 3 (p=0.006) but not with RAMP2. CONCLUSIONS: Cell surface association of CRLR with all three RAMPs exists with similar degree of associations in resting RMASM cells. CGRP family peptides deferentially enhance proximal association of CRLR with RAMPs on cell surface. These findings suggest the potential use of PLA technology for monitoring the functional CRLR/RAMP dimerization and receptor/peptide interaction in the reproductive and vascular actions of CGRP family peptides. Animal studies indicate that several reproductive disorders are influenced by adverse factors during fetal and neonatal development 1 . We have shown that MPR during P and L reduces sperm concentration 2 . It is suggested that early life nutritional adversity is associated with increased OS 3 . OS damages spermatogenic cells, the spermatogenic process and sperm function 4 . We therefore investigated MPR effects MPR in P and L on sperm OS, function fertility. METHODS: We studied male rat OFF whose mothers ate control (CC) (20% casein) or restricted (RR) (10% casein) isocaloric diet in P and L. After birth all rats ate C diet. At postnatal day (PND) 110 were rats were euthanized and epidiymal and vas deferens sperm obtained to measure: 1) OS by quantifying reactive oxygen species (ROS -by fluorescence), malonaldialdehyde (MDA -by spectrophotometry) and superoxide dismutase (SOD -by xanthinoxidase assay) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx -chemical colorimetry) activity. 2) sperm quality (concentration, viability and motility). Reproductive capacity was evaluated by fertility rate. Data are M \u00b1 SEM; analysis by t-test; n=6 per group, p<0.05. RESULTS: At PND 110, RR sperm had higher ROS levels and decreased GPx activity and sperm concentration vs C without changes in MDA ( Figure 1A-D) . Sperm viability and motility were similar. Fertility rate was unaffected in RR ( Figure 1E ). *Figure(s) will be available online. (Dodic, Clin Sci 1999) influence development of the ANS with negative implications for stress susceptibility and cardiovascular health in later life. We hypothesized that prenatal stress (PS) alters development of the fetal ANS determined by fetal heart rate variability (FHRV) and baroreceptor reflex (BR) responses. METHODS: Seven pregnant ewes underwent isolation stress twice weekly for 3h between 0.2 and 0.67 gestation (g). Eight non-stressed pregnant ewes were used as controls. After chronic fetal instrumentation, electrocardiogram was recorded and FHRV calculated in the time (SDNN/ RMSSD) and frequency domain (LF/HF) at 0.75 and 0.87g, i.e. 12 and 30 days after PS. BR sensitivity was derived from blood pressure (BP) responses to phenylephrine (PE) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP). RESULTS: Baseline fetal BP was lower in previously stressed fetuses (SF) at 0.75 (40\u00b11 vs. 35\u00b12 mmHg, mean\u00b1SEM) and 0.87g (51\u00b1 2 vs.43\u00b11 mmHg) and fetal heart rate (HR) was lower at 0.87g (178\u00b15 vs. 164\u00b14 bpm) (p<0.05). SDNN was higher in SF at 0.75g reflecting higher autonomic tone (p<0.05). RMSSD and HF which reflect parasympathetic activity were lower in SF at 0.87g (p<0.05). Since LF which reflects sympathetic activity was also reduced at 0.87g (p<0.05), LF/HF ratio as a marker of sympathovagal balance was lower in SF (p<0.05) implicating a shift towards parasympathetic activity. PS did not affect BR sensitivity. However, range of BR regulation in response to PE was lower in SF at 0.75 and 0.87g (p<0.05, Fig. 1) . PS resets the BR as shown by a left shift of the BR response curve meaning that HR was lower for any given pressure (p<0.05, Fig. 1 ). CONCLUSIONS: Higher autonomic tone after PS implicates early maturation of ANS. Sympathovagal balance and range of BP regulation were still altered 30 days after PS suggesting prolonged effects on fetal autonomic HR and BP regulation. *Figure(s) will be available online. (GDM) is associated with longterm cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in offspring. However, the mechanisms are not well understood. We explored whether fetal exposure to a diabetic environment is associated with endothelial progenitor cell dysfunction, and whether vitamin D can reverse the impairment. METHODS: This was a nested case-control study. Nineteen women with uncomplicated pregnancies and 18 women with GDM were recruited. Time to first appearance of endothelial colony forming cell (ECFCs) colonies and number of colonies formed were determined. Angiogenesisrelated functions of ECFCs in vitro were tested in the presence or absence of vitamin D. RESULTS: Fetal ECFCs from GDM pregnancies formed fewer colonies in culture (GDM: 2.94 \u00b1 1.66, uncomplicated pregnancies: 5.83 \u00b1 3.41, P=0.04) and displayed increased population-doubling times (GDM: 4.17 \u00b1 1.23 days, uncomplicated pregnancies: 2.31 \u00b1 0.43 days, P=0.02) compared to uncomplicated pregnancies. Fetal ECFCs exposed to GDM in pregnancy or to hyperglycemia in vitro exhibited less migration (GDM: 54.72% \u00b1 9.25%, uncomplicated pregnancies: 64.6% \u00b1 7.63%, P=0.04; control (5.5 mM)= 1 vs. 7 mM glucose: 0.94 \u00b1 0.06, P=0.04; 11 mM glucose: 0.88 \u00b1 0.07, P=0.006; 15 mM glucose: 0.87 \u00b1 0.09, P=0.009) and less tubule formation (GDM: 3.28E+07 mm \u00b1 7.75E+06 mm, n=15; uncomplicated pregnancies: 3.95E+07 mm \u00b1 9.63E+06 mm, P=0.03; control (5.5 mM) =1, 7 mM glucose: 0.79 \u00b1 0.16, P=0.045; 11 mM glucose: 0.77 \u00b1 0.06, P=0.001; 15 mM glucose: 0.69 \u00b1 0.22, P=0.03) than control. Vitamin D significantly improved the dysfunction of fetal ECFCs from pregnancies complicated by GDM or after exposure of healthy ECFCs to hyperglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: Fetal ECFCs from GDM pregnancies or ECFCs exposed to hyperglycemia in vitro exhibit impaired quantity and",

            "text": "We performed a retrospective cohort study of all neonates with clinically suspected HIE admitted to the Johns Hopkins NICU from January 2007 to September 2014 for whole body cooling. The cohort was stratified based on presence of clinically diagnosed chorioamnionitis at delivery. MRI imaging, performed between 2-23 days of life, was evaluated for evidence of brain inflammation or edema. RESULTS: During this time period, 155 neonates were admitted to our NICU for whole body cooling with suspected HIE. Of these, 137 had brain MRIs performed near delivery. Results regarding presence of clinical or histologic chorioamnionitis and presence of abnormality as noted on MRI are noted in Table 1 There is increasing evidence of cerebral side effects such as delayed myelination but knowledge of impact on functional brain development is sparse. We examined the influence of GC on maturation of cerebral processing of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) in fetal sheep, the animal model in which antenatal GC therapy has been developed. Cortical SEP reflect information processing in the cortical network. Additionally, early components are influenced by afferent and subcortical transmission of the stimuli. METHODS: Chronically instrumented pregnant sheep received 2x110\u00b5g/ kg BM i.m. 24h apart (n=12) or saline (n=9) at 105, 112 and 119 days gestation (dG, term 150 dG). This dose is equivalent to the clinically used 2x8mg BM administered to a 70kg woman. Trigeminal SEP were evoked prior to, 4h and 24h after each injection and 7d after the last treatment course. RESULTS: SEP peaks were already detectable at 0.7 gestation. The early and late cortical responses N20 and N200 were the most reproducible peaks (Fig. 1) . Latencies of these peaks decreased over the examination period (p<0.05, Fig. 1 ). BM did not have an acute effect on SEP amplitudes and latencies 4h and 24h following administration. Chronically, BM delayed the latency decrease of the N200 but not of the N20 by two weeks (p<0.05, Fig. 1 ). CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral processing of sensory stimuli is present in the third trimester. BM delays maturation of late but not early cortical SEP responses suggesting that BM affects maturation of sensory processing in the cortical network rather than maturation of afferent pathways. *Figure(s) will be available online.

We hypothesized that vagotomy (Vx) will result in hyperglycemia and this will be correlated to a higher degree of neuroinflammation. METHODS: Near-term fetal sheep were surgically prepared with vascular catheters and bilateral Vx without (n=11) or with vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) electrodes (n=3). At 72h post-operative recovery, n=11 animals served as controls; n=13 received lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (LPS group) to induce inflammation; Vx and Vx+VNS animals also received LPS (Vx+LPS and Vx+VNS+LPS groups). Fetal arterial blood was sampled during surgery before and after Vx, on each post-operative day, baseline (0 hours) and seven selected time points (3-48h) to profile inflammation (ELISA IL-6, pg/mL), insulin (ELISA, ng/mL) and glucose levels (mg/ dL). 54h post LPS, necropsy was performed and neuroinflammation quantified as Iba1+ brain microglia immunofluorescence. Results are reported for p<0.05. RESULTS: Surgery, Vx and post-operative period had no effects on glucose averaging 17\u00b15 (mean\u00b1SEM). Overall, glucose levels in Vx+LPS were higher vs. control and LPS groups at all time points and VNS normalized them; LPS alone had no effect on glucose or insulin levels, so we report mean values for control and LPS groups. At baseline, Vx+LPS glucose levels were 21\u00b15 vs. 16\u00b13; insulin values were similar. At 3h post LPS, IL-6 peaked 481\u00b1310 vs. 1\u00b11 at baseline and Vx+LPS glucose was 20\u00b14 vs. 15\u00b13. Vx+LPS insulin levels increased at 0.6\u00b10.4 vs. 0.2\u00b10.1. At 48h post LPS, Vx+LPS glucose was 22\u00b16 vs. 17\u00b13, while insulin values returned to baseline. In Vx+LPS, higher glucose levels at 54h correlated to higher degree of neuroinflammation in hippocampal regions CA23 and dentate gyrus as well as thalamus (r=0.92, r=0.95, r=0.84 (p=0.07)). CONCLUSIONS: Complete withdrawal of vagal innervation results in a 72h delayed onset of sustained hyperglycemia for at least 54h. Under conditions of moderate fetal inflammation, this is related to a transient hyperinsulinemia and higher levels of brain inflammation. This suggests an important role of vagus nerve in both glusosensing and neuroinflammation and warrants further investigation to help prevent perinatal brain injury. We developed an in vivo -in vitro animal model to study the mechanisms of the developmental programming of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced neuroinflammation with focus on microglia phenotype. Near-term fetal sheep were exposed in vivo to low dose LPS (second hit control, SHC) to mimic subclinical FN; na\u00efve microglia were exposed in vivo to NaCl (na\u00efve control, NC) and then to LPS in vitro (na\u00efve LPS, NL). SHC were then exposed to LPS in vitro (second hit LPS, SHL). We reported that in such paradigm LPS second hit results in amplification of microglial cytokine (IL-1\u03b2) production in vitro (Cao et al., IJDN, in press) .",

RESULTS: Up regulation of inflammatory pathways NFKB, PIK3-Akt and JAK-Stat in NL microglia was accompanied by a down regulation of metabolic pathways. FBP was up regulated in SH microglia and was unique to these samples (log 2 = 4.057 and padj = 9.40 x 10 -2 ) confirming recent observations in neonatal murine microglia that FBP may regulate We performed whole transcriptome sequencing at high throughput of microglia primary cultures (Figure 2 ). We then performed 3 differential analyses: we compared (1) NL versus NC;(2) NC to SHC and (3) the difference in response between NL and SHL. For downstream analysis see Figure 2 . RESULTS: Our method allowed a fast screening of the complete fetal sheep transcriptome at low cost. A poorly covered reference genome limited our approach, however, this will improve with time. Our 3 differential analyses allowed discovering significant genes, such as HMOX1 and FBP and pathways involved in FN. Clustering genes by hierarchical clustering, by functionality and by ontology allowed to filter out candidate genes having an effect on FN. Notably, our comparative approach permits inferences even with a single replicate. This allowed us to quantify the genomic response of SH compared to NL. CONCLUSIONS: Fetal sheep microglial transcriptome approach allows studying mechanisms of FN to identify mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. Future research should aim to perform bisulfite sequencing to complete our analysis of the transcriptome by epigenetic studies.",

RNA libraries were prepared for directional RNAsequencing. 100bp single end reads of 6 samples (2 \u03b1-mannosidosis, 2 Sandhoff disease, 2 healthy controls cat brain cortical tissue) were sequenced in one multiplexed lane using an Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. RESULTS: Because the UCSC reference genome database for domestic cat has relatively low depth coverage (12x), we aligned sequenced reads with human genome and identified several differently expressed genes, including those related to growth factors and the tyrosine kinase system, GM2 ganglioside synthesis/degradation enzymes, GM2 activator protein, iron metabolism proteins (transferrin and lactotransferrin), and dendrite spine development proteins (semaphorin3A, TAOK2, intersectins, septin7) and their signal transduction elements. To assess the robustness of our human/cat homology, we validated 17 differentially expressed genes by q-PCR.

Response to IR, P53 which showed a significant increase on binding to promoter site of various genes. Vaginal LPS administration increases phosphorylation of JNK-p53 in the fetal brain response to IR. The vulnerability of brain hemorrhage in response to IR was increased in the V plus IR group. Moreover, a known p53 inhibitor, PFT-alpha, blocked P53-dependent various protein phosphorylation. Thus, pretreatment with PFT-\u03b1 may serve to rescue fetuses from cerebral hemorrhage response to IR with vaginal LPS. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal inflammation increased the vulnerability of fetal brain hemorrhage may be via a P53-dependent protein phosphorylation. One effect of DHA is the up-regulation of galanin via the induction of leptin, a hormone that modulates food intake. To assess the involvement of galanin in neurogenesis, we evaluated concentrations of galanin and factors affecting neural development in amniotic fluid. METHODS: Amniotic fluid was obtained from 523 women undergoing an amniocentesis at 15 to 19 weeks gestation. Aliquots were assayed by ELISA for concentrations of galanin, neurotrophin (NT)-3 and -4, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), leptin, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) and the 70kDa heat shock protein (hsp70). Intraamniotic levels of fatty acids were determined by gas chromatography. Correlations between assays were analyzed by the Spearman rank correlation test. RESULTS: Positive correlations were observed between galanin and arachidonic acid (r=0.3930, p=0.0027), DHA (r=0.3644, p=0.0058), oleic acid (r=0.3341, p=0.01), leptin (r=0.7205, p<0.0001), and neurotrophin 4 (r=0.2811, p=0.0375). Conversely, negative correlations were seen between galanin and gestational age at delivery (r=-0.2280, p=0.0002), EMMPRIN (r=-0.3107, p=0.0187), NT-3 (r=-0.3003,p=0.0381) and birthweight (r=-0.1310, P=0.0378). No associations were found between galanin and maternal age, body mass index, gestational age at time of amniocentesis, gravidity, parity, meconium at delivery, palmitic acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid, MMP-8, NGF, BDNF, IL-6, IL-8 and Hsp70. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that good nutrition (high intake of DHA and arachidonic acid) induces leptin (promotes fat intake) which then induces galanin to enhance neural cell survival and neurogenesis. In addition, galanin inhibits production of EMMPRIN which disrupts the blood-brain barrier and causes inflammation, and NT-3 which induces apoptosis of neural cells. The findings support the importance of a diet high in DHA and AA supplementation during pregnancy. However, whether brain weights are similarly reduced, or preserved by \"brain sparing\" mechanisms, and whether energy levels are depleted leading to membrane failure and overt injury, remain unknown.

Animals were necropsied near-term for fetal growth measures, and fetal brains were immersion-fixed for later assessment of necrotic cell injury using standard H&E criteria and apoptotic cell injury using the TUNEL assay method. Significance was assumed for p<0.05. RESULTS: Nine control (31 fetuses) and twelve MNR (42 fetuses) sows were necropsied with MNR fetal weights decreased 28%. Select AGAcontrol (n=18) and FGR-MNR (n=18) fetuses underwent full necropsy with FGR-MNR weights decreased 37%, brain weights decreased 12% and brain to liver weight ratios increased 48%. Overall, low levels of necrotic cells were observed, with no differences between groups. While low levels of apoptotic cells were also observed, averaging 0.75/HPF and 1.18/HPF (40x) for AGA-control and FGR-MNR animals, respectively, FGR-MNR levels were higher in the periventricular white matter (2x), the hippocampus CA1 (3x), CA4 (1.7x) and dentate gyrus (3x) CONCLUSIONS: MNR in guinea pigs results in FGR with small livers relative to brain weights, likely indicating blood flow redistribution, characteristic of asymmetrical FGR. These fetuses have reduced brain weights, but with substantial \"brain sparing\", and with no increased necrotic cell injury indicating that the threshold for membrane failure with energy depletion has likely not been reached.

We aimed to characterize periventricular white matter inflammation and neuronal injury after experimental CDI and contrast this with Ureaplasma intra-amniotic infection (IAI), which has been associated with cerebral white matter damage. METHODS: Chronically instrumented rhesus macaques received intra-amniotic inoculation with U.parvum (serovar 1; 10 7 cfu/mL) at 127\u00b11dGA (term=167d; n=5). Age matched controls received vehicle only (n=6). Three animals with catheters placed between the maternalfetal membranes received repeated choriodecidual inoculation (10 7 -10 9 cfu/mL). Fetal brains collected after cesarean section at 153\u00b14dGA were processed for histopathological assessment of inflammatory cell activation (GFAP, Iba1) and cell death (Casp-3). Levels of inflammatory mediators and Ureaplasma colony counts were determined in serial samples of amniotic fluid. RESULTS: CDI resulted in negative AF bacterial cultures and absence of labor-like contractions. In contrast, IAI resulted in a robust fetal inflammatory response and onset of contractions. Fetal brains from IAI animals showed a significant increase in periventricular microglial activation (Iba1 positive) compared to control (p=0.001). Despite the lack of microbial invasion into the amniotic cavity, CDI fetal brains showed a further marked increase in periventricular Iba1 staining compared to IAI animals.

CONCLUSIONS: In neonatal HI encephalopathy, it is possible that SDF-1\u03b1 might be influential on the spatial perception ability without physical improvement of the brain injury.

Maternal absence of IL-1 attenuates the fetal response and blunts the inflammatory downstream effects. Processing of acoustic stimuli in the auditory cortex was determined in 6 fetuses. Cortical auditory evoked potentials (cAEP) were induced at 105\u00b11, 112\u00b11, 119\u00b11 and 126\u00b11 days gestation (dG, term 150 dG) using a tone of 500Hz, 100dB SPL and 50ms duration with inter-stimuli intervals of 0.8-1.2sec applied at the maternal abdominal wall for 5min. To induce a fetal arousal, VAS were applied to 9 sheep at 120\u00b12, 127\u00b12 and 130\u00b11dG using an electronic artificial larynx (12 stimuli for 30sec with a peak frequency of 250-750Hz producing an intrauterine sound pressure of 125-35dB). The cochlea was ablated in 3 fetuses to discriminate the role of the peripheral auditory and proprioceptive system in perception of VAS. Fetal arousal was detected by spectral analysis of the EEG. RESULTS: cAEP were already detectable in 5/6 fetuses at 110dG. Latency of cAEP peaks decreased continuously until 125dG and amplitudes started to increase at 125dG reflecting cortical maturation (p<0.05). During NREM sleep, cortical arousal in response to VAS was firstly detectable at 127dG revealed by fast activation of the EEG within 32ms. At 131dG, arousal prolonged or induced a sleep state change. At this age, unspecific changes of cortical activity without a fast arousal response developed during REM sleep. Bilateral cochlea ablation prevented fetal arousal. CONCLUSIONS: Cortical processing of acoustic stimuli begins in the early third trimester and precedes arousability of the fetus which starts in the middle of the third trimester. The fetus is especially sensitive to acoustic but not vibratory stimuli. (n=104). GSEA identified greater enrichment of neuroinflammatory processes in the LPS-MgSO 4 cohort than the LPS-PBS cohort, most prominently in the Tnfr1 network. The LPS-PBS cohort was significantly enriched in extracellular matrix genes. In this group, the network downstream of Tgfb1 was most enriched (z-score, 5.6, p<0.05). Tgfb1-regulated genes were also enriched after MgSO 4 (z-score, 6.2). qPCR for genes in the networks for Tnfr1 or Tgfb1 confirmed the pathway analysis in pilot studies comparing PBS-PBS and LPS-PBS (Tlr4 and Il6, p<0.05).",

Protective effects of sex steroids such as progesterone and estrogen have not been well studied in the perinatal brain. In this study we looked specifically at the deleterious effects of inflammation on neurogenesis, and the possible protective effects of progesterone. METHODS: Timed pregnant mice (n = 8) were given intraperitoneal (IP) injections of 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine, a thymidine analog (Brdu) (20mg/kg) and progesterone (42mg/kg) or vehicle on embryonic day 17. Two hours later, mice were given IP LPS (100ug/kg) or vehicle. C-section was performed on embryonic day 18. Two-color immunofluorescence was performed with primary antibodies Tbr2 and Iba1. Cells counts were obtained from images spanning cortex from the ventricular to pial surface. Statistical analysis was determined using Anova and Tukey-Kramer. RESULTS: Microglia were abundant in progenitor zones of the developing cortex and contacted intermediate neural progenitor (INP) cells. After LPS exposure, microglia displayed a more activated phenotype and cell density was increased compared to sham or progesterone only controls (p < 0.0001). Tbr2+ INP cell density decreased after LPS exposure compared to control (p=0.0022). However, progesterone pretreatment prior to LPS, statistically increased Tbr2+ INPs compared to progesterone treatment alone (p=0.0022) and was not different from control INPs *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: LPS induced systemic inflammation reduces prenatal neurogenesis. Progesterone treatment prior to inducing systemic inflammation is associated with increased neurogenesis compared to progesterone alone and was equal to controls. Progesterone may protect the preterm brain from defects of neurogenesis induced by inflammation.",

The current study included non-anomalous singleton gestations for which there was complete information on CP and chorioamnionitis (COA). We excluded multiples and those with missing outcome data. Our primary exposure was COA, defined by clinical diagnosis of COA and a maternal fever >100F; our secondary exposure was culture-proven sepsis (CPS). Our primary outcome was diagnosis of CP and our secondary outcome either CP or death (CP+death). CP was defined as two of the following: delay in motor milestones, abnormalities on neuromotor exam, aberrations in primitive reflexes or diagnosis of spastic hemiplegia or diplegia. We conducted bivariate analyses on the exposures and outcomes and fit a log-linear regression model, adjusting for possible confounders to assess factors related to CP. RESULTS: 1858 patients were included; 218 (11.73%) had COA, and 312(16.79%) had CPS. Only 21.1% of infants of women diagnosed with COA had CPS. Gestational age (GA) at delivery was significantly lower in infants born to mothers with COA (28+5/7 wks vs 29+6/7 wks, p<0.001) compared with those without COA. Women with COA were more likely to deliver via cesarean and deliver infants with a 5-min Apgar score less than 7. There were no significant differences in CP (13.58% vs 11.65% p=0.5973) or CP+death (11.45% vs 11.76% p=0.9041) for infants born to mothers with or without COA. After adjusting for confounders there remained no difference in CP in either group. However, infants diagnosed with CPS were more likely to develop CP (33.33% vs 16.04% p=<0.001) as well as CP+death (41.57% vs 14.36%, p=<0.0001). After adjusting for confounders, CPS was still associated with a higher risk of CP+death (table 1) . *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to COA did not influence rates of development of CP, however a diagnosis of CPS was associated with moderate to severe CP or death. Neonatal sepsis, rather than chorioamnionitis, should warrant close surveillance for neurologic sequelae. Our objectives were to quantify mRNA and protein levels of 5 AQPs (AQP1, AQP3, AQP8, AQP9 and AQP11) in ovine amnion during control conditions, determine changes in AQP expression profile when AFV and IMA rate were experimentally altered, and analyze the relationships of AQP expression levels with IMA rate and AFV.

            "text": "Obesity in pregnancy is associated with increased fetal growth and adiposity and is linked to the development of metabolic syndrome in the adult offspring. Fetal growth is dependent on nutrient supply, hence related to placental transport of nutrients. Placental fatty acid transport proteins (FATPs) and fatty acid translocase (FAT) are integral transmembrane proteins responsible for cellular uptake of fatty acids. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-\u03b3) is a lipid sensor that regulates the expression of FAT/FATPs. We hypothesized that maternal obesity in mice is associated with an increased placental expression of FAT/FATPs and lipid accumulation in the fetal liver. METHODS: C57/BL6J female mice were fed either a control (C; n=10) or an obesogenic (OB; n=10) high fat-high sugar diet for 4-weeks before mating and throughout pregnancy. At E18.5 animals were sacrificed, fetal and placental tissues collected. Trophoblast plasma membranes (TPM) were isolated from pooled placental homogenates (H) for each litter. TPM purity was determined by alkaline phosphatase enrichment. Protein expression of FAT/FATPs (TPM) and PPAR-\u03b3 (H) was determined by immunoblotting. Sections of fetal livers were stained for Red Oil O and lipid droplets were quantified using ImageJ software. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t-test. RESULTS: TPM alkaline phosphatase enrichment was similar between C and OB groups (10-fold vs. 11-fold). TPM protein expression of FAT and FATP2 was not different between C and OB groups. In contrast, TPM FATP6 expression increased 36% (p<0.05) in OB compared to C placentas. PPAR-\u03b3 expression was unchanged between groups. Preliminary data indicated a ~10-fold increase in lipid droplets in the livers of fetuses from OB compared to C group (n=3/group; p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that FAT, FATP2 and 6 proteins are expressed in TPM from mouse placentas. TPM FATP6 expression was increased in obese dams and was associated with increased lipid deposition in the fetal liver. Up-regulation of placental FATP6 in maternal obesity may contribute to increased delivery of fatty acids to the fetus and accumulation of lipids in the fetal liver. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) affects approximately 8% of pregnancies and is associated with peri-and postnatal adverse health outcomes including metabolic syndromes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. The most frequent cause of IUGR is placental dysfunction, making this tissue a prime candidate for further investigation of molecular level alterations that may be linked to fetal growth restriction.",

Obese women (OB) have increased risk for gestational problems and impaired fetal growth, with programming effects on intrauterine growth and future health. Indeed, we recently showed abnormal placental (P) biometry in OB, leading to decreased P efficiency. Chronic mild inflammation and mitochondrial (mt) dysfunction have been reported in many tissues, but little is known about the obesity effect on P mt. Here, we studied P mtDNA levels, accounting for the cell mt content, in OB and normal weight (NW) women METHODS: P collection at elective cesarean section from 10 NW (BMI 18-25) and 13 OB (BMI\u00b330) with no diabetes or other maternal diseases.Maternal decidua was discarded, villi quickly frozen. mtDNA measured by RealTimePCR relative quantification (CytB/RNAseP) RESULTS: In our study population mtDNA was significantly increased in P villi from OB placentas vs NW (331\u00b1104 vs 170\u00b151; p=0.000) *Figure(s) will be available online. mtDNA levels were significantly related to BMI (R 2 =0.54, p=0.000) OB weight gain was significantly lower vs NW (7.8\u00b13.4 vs 11.5\u00b13.3; p=0.03) while maternal-gestational age, P and fetal weight, maternal Hb were not significantly different. No mtDNA differences depending on fetal sex CONCLUSIONS: We previously reported altered mt levels in pregnancies characterized by P insufficiency, presenting increased inflammation/oxidative stress (OxS). Here we found increased mt content in our study population of OB-non diabetic women, suggesting a P functional impairment depending on maternal BMI. This might account for increased OxS, related to inflammation, due to the lipotoxic effect of high intracellular fatty acids in OB. Higher mtDNA may reflect a P compensatory response to obesity, which in several tissues have been associated with impairment of mt function. Further data are needed to confirm our results",

A high maternal dietary fat and salt intake can affect placental function, thereby increasing the incidence of fetal growth restriction (FGR). FGR is associated with increased perinatal morbidity as well as increased incidence of cardiovascular disease, hypertension and diabetes in adult life. Metabolomic profiling has the potential to reveal altered maternal and fetal metabolic pathways in a diet-induced FGR rat model. The present study therefore examined the effects of maternal high fat and/or salt on placental metabolism. METHODS: Virgin Sprague Dawley rats were assigned to one of 4 dietary groups: control (CD; n=8; fat 10% kcals); high salt (SD; n=6; salt 4%, fat 10%); high fat (HF; n=8; fat 45%) and HF and salt (HFSD; n=6; salt 4%, fat 45%) 21 days prior to mating. At gestational day 18, dams were culled, and fetus and placenta weighed. Tissues were snap-frozen for metabolic profiling of placentas using gas-and liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry. RESULTS: A maternal HF intake significantly reduced fetal (HF 3.68\u00b10.04 vs. CD 3.99\u00b10.07 g; p<0.05) and placental weight (HF 0.50\u00b10.1 vs. CD 0.64\u00b10.02 g; p<0.05). There was no effect of high salt on fetal weight when compared to controls (p>0.05), but placental weight was significantly reduced in males only (SD 0.61\u00b10.01 vs. CD 0.67\u00b10.03 g; p<0.05). A significant decrease in the abundance of palmitoleic acid (p<0.001) and an increase in the levels of longer-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; p<0.001) were observed in HF and HFSD placentas. A non-significant trend in pentadecanoic acid and 4-aminobutyric acid metabolism alteration due to high salt intake was observed. CONCLUSIONS: A maternal HF diet altered placental metabolic profiles, with increased amounts of longer-chain PUFA observed. It was not determined, however, whether changes in essential fatty acid metabolism took place in maternal or placental tissues. Further studies are required to fully elucidate the impact of a maternal HF diet on the availability of PUFAs to the placenta and/or fetus. This, and future studies, are important in providing a better understanding of maternal obesity and its impact on fetal growth.",

Lung development is also influenced by essential fatty acids. We demonstrated that circulating fetal essential fatty acids were altered by placental insufficiency in a sex-specific manner. Essential fatty acid transfer across the placenta is regulated by fatty acid transport proteins 1 (SLC27A1), 2 (SLC27A2) and 4 (SLC27A4), as well as endothelial lipase (LIPG). We hypothesize that in utero MTS exposure sex-specifically alters mRNA transcript levels of SLC27A1, SLC27A2, SLC27A4 and LIPG in the rat placenta. METHODS: Pregnant rats were exposed to tobacco smoke (MTS) or room air (Control) from embryonic day 11 to term. Placentas from male and female MTS and control pups were collected at delivery. Real-time RT-PCR was used to measure mRNA transcript levels of SLC27A1, SLC27A2, SLC27A4 and LIPG. RESULTS: Male placental mRNA levels of SLC27A1 and SLC27A2 were 55\u00b116%* and 38\u00b145%*, respectively, of the female placental levels. Basal SLC27A4 and LIPG mRNA levels were similar between male and female placenta. In male placenta, MTS decreased LIPG mRNA to 52\u00b127%* relative to male control placenta. In female placenta, MTS increased SLC27A1 to 211\u00b188%* and SLC27A4 to 155\u00b141%* mRNA relative to female control placenta. (*p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Basal mRNA levels of fatty acid transporters differs between placenta of male and female pups. In addition to basal differences in expression, MTS also alters mRNA levels of fatty acid transporters in a sex-dependent manner in rat placenta. We speculate that MTSinduced sex-specific differences in lung development may be a function of differences in maternal-fetal transport of essential fatty acids in male and female offspring.",

Because mTORC2 is a positive regulator of trophoblast amino acid transport, mTORC2 inhibition may contribute to decreased placental amino acid transfer in IUGR. INTRODUCTION: Triclosan (TCS) is a potential endocrine disruptor, which is widely used in personal care products and can be detected in human body fluids. It has been shown that triclosan can interfere with steroid biosynthesis and metabolism. 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11\u03b2-HSD2) is a high-affinity cortisol-inactivating enzyme which is highly expressed in human placental syncytiotrophoblasts, thus ensuring the normal development of fetus in the presence of high levels of maternal cortisol in pregnancy. However, effect of triclosan on 11\u03b2-HSD2 and apoptosis and whether these two events are correlated in human placental syncytiotrophoblasts remains unexplored. METHODS: Primary human placenta syncytiotrophoblasts were isolated from placenta collected at c section without labor at term. After syncytialization, the level of 11\u03b2-HSD2 was examined after treatment with triclosan from 0.001\u00b5M to 10\u00b5M for 24h. We also examined the levels of proteins associated with apoptosis, including caspase3, Bcl-2 and Bax. In order to explain the relationship between inhibition of 11\u03b2-HSD2 and apoptosis induced by triclosan, pre-incubation (1 h) of the cells with apoptosis inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (30\u00b5M) followed by co-incubation (24 h) with Z-VAD-FMK (30\u00b5M) and triclosan (0.1\u00b5M) was carried out. RESULTS: Triclosan inhibited 11\u03b2-HSD2 mRNA, protein and activity levels in a concentration-dependent manner from 0.001\u00b5M to 10\u00b5M. Triclosan reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis in human placenta syncytiotrophoblasts as demonstrated by observations ofincreased DNA fragmentation and apoptosis-associated proteins such as Bax and cleaved-caspase3, and decreased pro-caspase3 and Bcl-2. Blocking the apoptosis induced by triclosan using pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, the inhibition by 11\u03b2-HSD2 was significantly attenuated. CONCLUSIONS: Triclosan may induce apoptosis in human placental syncytiotrophoblasts thereby reducing the level of 11\u03b2-HSD2. These findings raise the possibility that over-exposure to triclosan could impair the placenta glucocorticoid barrier in pregnancy thus influencing the development of the fetus.",

Since successful placental development is crucial for optimal health of the embryo/fetus into adulthood, we tested whether elevated maternal T induce sex-specific alterations in genetic pathways involved in angiogenesis and vascular development in the placentas. METHODS: Pregnant SD rats were injected with vehicle or T propionate (0.5 mg/kg/day from gestation day 15-19 to increase plasma T levels twofold, similar to that observed in preeclampsia. Global gene expression in placentas from T-exposed rats was compared with controls at 20 days of gestation using the Affimetrix Rat 1.0 microarray chip, and results confirmed with real-time PCR. RESULTS: Elevated T levels induced significant differences in 675 genes with 429 being up-regulated and 246 down-regulated in male T placentas compared to male control placentas ( \u00b31.2-fold; P<0.05). The web based gene set enrichment analysis (WebGestalt) analysis revealed that in male T placentas key genes involved in the vasculature development (46 genes), blood vessel morphogenesis (40 genes), and angiogenesis (36 genes) were dysregulated. Elevated T levels in the female placentas, differently expressed 419 genes with 272 being up-regulated and 147 down-regulated compared to female control placentas (\u00b31.2-fold; P<0.05). WebGestalt analysis revealed a small set of genes related to angiogenesis (20 genes) and fat cell differentiation (12 genes) were differentially expressed in female T placentas compared to controls. Interestingly, T dysregulates unique sets of angiogenesis genes in male (7 genes) and female (23 genes) placentas. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a novel role for T in dysregulating genes involved in vascular development and angiogenesis in placenta in a sex-specific manner, which may contribute for fetal growth restriction and long term gender-specific cardiovascular dysfunction. We sought to characterize the initiation of placental hormonal production in singleton and multifetal pregnancies as defined by the production of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4). METHODS: Oocyte donation charts from 1/04 to 4/13 were reviewed to identify programmed recipient cycles with live birth. Patients were treated with E2 (monitored step-wise program) and P4 50mg daily. Outcome measures were serial E2 and P4 with mean values calculated for cycle days 28 (baseline) through 60. Singleton (single gestational sac w/single live birth) vs twins (two gestational sacs w/two live births) data were evaluated. Baseline mean value was compared to each daily mean cycle day value using an unpaired t-test (p<0.05 was considered statistically significant). RESULTS: 622 cycles met inclusion criteria. E2 and P4 remained low but continued to increase daily. E2 was significantly elevated on Day 36 in both groups when compared to Day 28 baseline. P4 was significantly elevated on Day 47 in singletons and Day 45 for twins. When comparing the two groups, E2 significantly differed on Day 45 while P4 was not consistently different. * Figure( s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Endogenous placental E2 production occurs on day 36 in singleton and twin gestations while twin placental P4 production occurs earlier (day 45 vs 47). This study demonstrates that the luteoplacental shift occurs earlier than previously reported and also suggests that increased placental mass (ie twin pregnancies) results in increased placental steroidogenesis.",

However, the effects of hGH-V administration on outcomes related to maternal and fetal growth and metabolic outcomes have yet to be investigated. We examined the dose response relationship for hGH-V administration in a mouse model of normal pregnancy.

If indicated, future studies will investigate the effect of hGH-V in a model of fetal growth restriction. Imbalances in the intrauterine cytokine milieu around the time of implantation and invasion may play a causative role in disorders associated with early pregnancy failure, and are also associated with the abnormal trophoblast development seen in gestational trophoblastic disease. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of glucocorticoids on the placenta level of cytokines of the interleukin system and correlate this with the pregnancy and placenta outcome. METHODS: Dexamethasone acetate (DEX) was administered via drinking water at two doses 0.25 and 1 mg/ml. Control rats had access to dexamethasone-free drinking water. Whole placenta were snapfrozen in liguid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00baC. They were thawed and homogenized and the supernatant was used for ELISA to evaluate amounts of rat placental TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10 using EbioScience kits; statistical analysis was done using SPSS software. RESULTS: DEX ingestion was associated with a significant reduction of mean maternal and placental weights in the experimental groups with no change in placental efficiency and fetal body weights. No significant differences were detected in TNF\u03b1 between the control and experimental groups. IL-1\u03b1 levels were higher in the experimental group compared to control at 21 dg using the high DEX dose. IL-1\u03b2 levels were lower at 16 and higher at 19 dg in the experimental group with high DEX dose. With IL-2, the levels increased at 19 dg in the experimental group using low DEX dose. IL-4 and IL-10 levels were significantly higher at 16 dg in the experimental group using the high DEX dose. IL-6 levels were lower at 19 and 21 dg in the experimental group of the high dexamethasone dose compared to control. CONCLUSIONS: Dexamethasone administration is associated with induction of intrauterine growth restriction. In this experiment dexamethasone affected placenta growth and altered the expression of the pro-inflammatory and ant-inflammatory cytokines. is an enigmatic inflammatory condition of the placenta associated with fetal growth restriction (FGR) and stillbirth. It occurs in 5-15% of third trimester pregnancies. The cellular profile of VUE has been documented in live births, but has not been quantified or described in stillbirths. Moreover, little is known about the cytokine profile of the lesions thus full characterisation remains to be described. We hypothesised that the immune cells present in VUE lesions in stillbirth would be similar to live birth. We also proposed that the cytokines being produced by the cells in VUE lesions would indicate a cell-mediated immune response.",

METHODS: Villous explants and primary cytotrophoblast cells were isolated from elective terminations of normal pregnancies (1 st /2 nd trimester).

Antiviral responses were analysed by qRT-PCR after stimulation with an HCV-specific pathogen-associated molecular pattern. Cytokine/chemokine production was detected by ELISA. Apoptosis and NK chemotaxis was assessed by Flow cytometry. RESULTS: Our data suggest that trophoblast cells express many receptors involved in HCV-binding/entry and that trophoblast cells uptake HCV and respond to HCV-RNA sensing with production of Type I/III interferons. We also demonstrate that HCV-RNA sensing affects of trophoblast cells viability and induce secretion of chemokines that recruit and alter the phenotype of decidual NK cells.

Interferon-gamma (IFN-g) is a proinflammatory cytokine expressed at the human maternal-fetal interface, but its role(s) in normal pregnancy are currently unclear. IFN-g signal transduction is mediated through the JAK-STAT1 pathway. To identify the cells within the human placenta that respond to IFN-g, we developed placental whole mount immunofluorescence (WMIF) to examine JAK-STAT1 signaling. METHODS: Human placental explants from 1 st trimester (7-12 weeks) and term (39 weeks) placentas were cultured in vitro +/-IFN-g, and subjected to WMIF in conjunction with confocal microscopy. Cellular responsiveness to IFN-g was determined by examining expression of activated, phosphorylated STAT1 (pSTAT1). Furthermore, placentas were enzymatically dissociated to generate single cell suspensions, which were treated in vitro with IFN-g and subsequently analyzed for pSTAT1 expression by multicolor flow cytometry. RESULTS: All of the major cell populations within the human placenta could be distinguished by WMIF. Staining for pSTAT1 was not detected in untreated placentas, with the exception of sporadic expression in extravillous trophoblast (EVT). Differential pSTAT1 expression in response to IFN-g was observed in 1 st trimester placental explants: staining for pSTAT1 was detected in immune cells, fibroblasts and EVTs, but not in syncytiotrophoblast, villous cytotrophoblast or blood vessel endothelial cells. Similar results were observed by flow cytometry. Furthermore, comparable patterns of pSTAT1 staining were observed in term explants exposed to IFN-g.",

Additionally, ERAP2 and HLA-C expression profiling of untreated versus gamma-interferon (IFN-\u03b3, 20 ng/ml)-treated cells was performed. Lastly, to determine if there is a relationship between the ERAP2 variant and HLA-C expression level on immune response, a cellular immune activation assay was developed using cord blood (CB) lymphocyte response assessed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: BeWo and JEG-3 cells are homozygous for the major T allele of SNP rs2549782 and for the major G allele of SNP rs2248374 that causes non-sense mediated decay of the ERAP2 mRNA, thus lack ERAP2 protein expression. In these cells post-IFN-\u03b3 treatment, HLA-C was elevated 2-fold (p=0.0037) and 3-fold (p=0.0446) respectively but ERAP2 remained undetectable. On the other hand, JAr and T3M-3 are heterozygous for both SNPs allowing potential expression of the ERAP2 and ERAP2-v. The difference between these cells is T3M-3 up-regulated both ERAP2 and HLA-C by IFN-\u03b3. However, JAr cells had increased only ERAP2 expression by 2-fold (p=0.003) post-IFN-\u03b3 treatment but HLA-C expression remained untraceable. Interestingly, preliminary observation of the cellular immune activation assay revealed that only T3M-3 cells with ERAP2 expression and HLA-C caused immune activation of CD3-CD69+ cells by 3-folds compared to the other choriocarcinoma cell lines. The data suggests the presence of ERAP2-v and HLA-C in T3M-3 have contributed to the activation of immune response. The low level of immune activation in BeWo, JEG-3, and JAr may be due to lacking either ERAP2-v or HLA-C. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations suggest a possible immune mechanism for PE related to ERAP2-v and HLA-C expression, both of which are required for the activation of an immune response to trophoblast cells. Recently it has become apparent that, under certain circumstances, B cells are also able to produce a range of cytokines, which in turn influence activation or tolerance of other immune cells.

CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the expression of both, pro as well as anti-inflammatory cytokines by murine B cells is reduced in normal pregnancy, indicating a possible involvement of B cell originated cytokines in the pathology of early pregnancy losses.

Products of conception of 34 women with three or more unexplained consecutive miscarriages within 20 weeks of gestation with the same partner (case group) and two control groups, in the first group 21 women with one spontaneous miscarriage and no history of complicated pregnancy(ies) were included (sporadic miscarriage group), and the second control group consisted of 34 women who underwent an elective abortion for psychosocial reasons (elective abortion group). Immunohistochemical staining for C4d was performed on products of conception embedded in paraffin. Two experienced observers, blinded to the patients' clinical data, independently evaluated the slides. Positivity for C4d was scored semi-quantitatively. RESULTS: C4d deposition was present in products of conception of 18 out of 34 women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage (51.4%), compared to 7 out of 21 women with a sporadic miscarriage (33.3%), and 7 out of 34 women with an elective abortion (20.6%) (p=0.020). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that C4d, a classical complement activation marker, is increased at the fetal-maternal interface in women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage, this is indicative for anti-fetal immunity in these women. Further knowledge of this pathogenic mechanism may lead to the development of new treatment strategies for this group of patients. . This study aimed to expand this strategy by using a much wider-based screening approach to the same end. METHODS: Plasma miRNAs (n=752) from pregnant women (5 with PET, 5 with PET and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) foetuses, and 10 gestation-matched controls) were profiled using locked nucleic acid qPCR. MiRNA expression levels were normalised to mean total miRNA expression levels. Data normality was assessed using Shapiro-Wilk tests and unpaired t-tests were used to compare miRNA profiles between groups. In silico miRNA target pathway predictions were performed using Mirpath. RESULTS: Comparison between complicated vs. uncomplicated pregnancies revealed 38 miRNAs whose levels differed significantly between PET/PET+SGA cases and controls; 23 of these were elevated in PET and 15 were reduced (P<0.05). Of the former, 9 belonged to the placenta-specific chromosome 19 miRNA cluster (C19MC). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering and principal components analysis of miRNA profiles showed that PET samples partially segregated according to whether the pregnancies were normal or complicated by PET (PET+SGA and pure PET samples did not segregate). However, miR-1 was specifically lower in PET+SGA samples relative to pure PET and controls. In silico pathway analysis of C19MC miRNAs showed partial pathway convergence, particularly in those associated with cell signal transduction and immunomodulation (e.g. TGF-\u03b2 signalling). By contrast, limited convergence was observed with non-placental-specific miRNAs of these, the vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption pathway was the most significant predicted target. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the largest study profiling patient-specific circulatory miRNA signatures in PET. Our preliminary screen's identification of discriminatory miRNAs (additional to CM19C species) highlights the potential of circulatory miRNA signatures as noninvasive biomarkers for the prediction of PET. with clinic blood pressure (CBP) during pregnancy to determine if these measurements are inversely related to infant birth weight. The aim of this study was to clarify this issue. METHODS: 605 Japanese women were included in this prospective cohort study. Exposures were initial CBP, made before 20 weeks' gestation, and HBP made within 1 week of CBP. Outcome was infant's birth weight, categorized and ranked as follows: \u00b33500 g, 3000-3499 g, 2500-2999 g, and <2500 g. First, CBP and HBP were included into the proportional odds model separately. Second, both CBP and HBP were included in the model simultaneously to compare the effect size among CBP and HBP. RESULTS: Associations between diastolic blood pressure (DBP) measured in the clinic and at home and infant birth weight when each DBPs were included separately were described in figure1. When both clinic and home DBP were included simultaneously, the adjusted ORs per 1 standard deviation(SD) increase in each DBPs were 1.09 (95%CI: 0.89-1.34) and 1.27 (95%CI: 1.03-1.57), respectively. Neither systolic BP measurement was associated with infant birth weight. CONCLUSIONS: HBP before 20 weeks' gestation was more strongly associated with infant birth weight than CBP. HBP may be worth measuring during pregnancy. *Figure(s) will be available online. Undetected fetal growth restriction (FGR) is strongly associated with stillbirth. Serial ultrasound assessment of growth has been suggested to increase detection, but is resource intensive with each woman requiring 3-4 3 rd trimester ultrasound assessments. Uterine artery Doppler (UTAD) and placental morphometric assessment (PMA) have been suggested as adjuncts to fetal growth measurement, but do not have adequate individual specificity as primary screening tools for FGR. In this study we examine whether combining these tools in high-risk populations can reduce scan frequency with accurate detection of early onset FGR. METHODS: Data was obtained from a prospective cohort attending a high-risk antenatal clinic (Manchester Placenta Clinic). 582 women at high risk of FGR (previous small gestational age (SGA) delivery (266) or extreme placental serum markers (316)) were assessed at 22-24 weeks 5 5 The absence or presence of GCH was not associated with the recurrence of preeclampsia on subsequent pregnancy (p=0.267). And gestation-specific uric acid z-score as a continuous variable did not show any association with the prediction of preeclampsia on subsequent pregnancy (p=0.427). GCH was associated with the small for gestational age (p=0.010).",

However, interventions to prevent these pregnancy complications cannot be applied because we are not able to identify which nulliparous women are at risk. We aimed to identify women at risk for these four complications in the Adelaide and Auckland cohorts of the SCOPE study using clinical, lifestyle and genetic markers. METHODS: Detailed clinical and lifestyle variables were recorded at 15 and 20 weeks gestation and DNA was extracted from peripheral blood from mother, father, baby trios and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped. SNPs were selected on the basis of identified roles of the genes in which they occur in fundamental processes in placentation and maternal adaptation to pregnancy. Pregnancy outcomes were recorded after delivery. A three tier model for each complication was developed using logistic regression with the first tier aimed at high sensitivity and the second aimed at high specificity after which the two models were integrated. Correction for FDR was undertaken. At the first tier women were deemed to be at risk or at low risk. At risk pregnancies were assessed in the second tier to stratify participants into high or moderate risk. Figure( s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Home BP was immediately elevated just after the earthquake and gradually decreased over a month as we previously reported among hypertensive patients. Because we only analyzed BP who could keep their equipment, the BP change just after the earthquake might be underestimated.",

INTRODUCTION: In the previous studies, various subtypes of preeclampsia (PE) have been defined on the basis of the clinical features of patients. In addition, varied pathological backgrounds and symptoms have been observed in each of these subtypes. Thus, an intrinsic subtype classification (ISC) of PE that is based on these different backgrounds is required.

The third group contained women with mild PE and those with severe PE. We applied ISC using the following steps: (1) Selection of \"intrinsic\" genes that varied significantly from the arrays of the other groups but had relatively less variation among arrays within the same group. (2) Class prediction, which was performed using prediction analysis for microarrays (PAM), for drawing dendrograms with expression profiles of the selected intrinsic genes. The dendrograms represented the distances of the predicted classes. RESULTS: ISC could differentiate women without PE from those with severe PE in the first group. Similar results were observed in the second group. In addition, ISC could clearly differentiate women with mild PE from those with severe PE in the third group. Moreover, at least two subtypes were predicted in both the mild and severe PE groups by drawing a dendrogram of the intrinsic gene expression patterns. *Figure(s) will be available online.

Dopplers of the MCA and UA were carried out between 19-38 weeks. After delivery the placenta was histologically examined for various abnormalities including DV. RESULTS: Compared to the population mean, the MCA-PI was lower, the UA-PI was higher and CPR was lower across all subgroups, especially in PE+IUGR and between 24-28 weeks. IUGR CPR followed the trend for the population mean, while in PE and PE+IUGR CPR showed a reversed trend across gestational age. *Figure(s) will be available online. Compared to IUGR, CPR was lower in PE (p=0.004) and PE+IUGR (p<0.001). Similarly, compared to IUGR gestational age at delivery was lower in PE (30w5d, p=0.008) and PE + IUGR (30w4d, p=0.006) and there was higher prevalence of DV in PE (62%, p=0.005) and PE+IUGR (62%, p=0.005) compared to IUGR (22%). CONCLUSIONS: PE and PE+IUGR have reversed CPR trend and more decidual vasculopathy compared to IUGR, suggesting that preeclampsia and IUGR have different pathophysiology. Moreover, CPR assessment at 24-28 weeks may play a role in identifying women who may benefit from individualized surveillance and interventions to reduce their high a priori risk of perinatal complications. . PS is a characterized by placental insufficiency and abnormal release of trophoblast products into maternal circulation, such as PAPP-A and \u03b2-hCG. These markers, used in first trimester screening for Down syndrome, have also been used in various models to predict PS later in pregnancy.

RESULTS: MoM PAPP-A was significantly lower in PE, IUGR and PE+IUGR groups (0.73, 0.69 and 0.57, resp.), but not in the GH and HELLP groups (0.92 and 1.17, resp.), compared to controls (0.99).

Using multivariate regression, MoM PAPP-A correlated negatively to mean BP, systolic BP, diastolic BP, and positively to neonatal weight, but not to proteinuria, platelet count or liver enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: A lower first trimester PAPP-A, but not b-hCG, is related to the later development of placental syndrome (PE and/or IUGR). GH and HELLP syndrome are not likely to be caused by placental dysfunction and should not be considered as placental syndromes. The prediction and management of preeclampsia should take into consideration the heterogeneous nature of the disease and stratify for placental function tests, such as PAPP-A. and we have reported that severe ICP and twin pregnancy are major risk factors for PET (Annual meeting of SGI 2014, abstract # 662).The mechanism by which ICP leads to PET is still unknown but it has been suggested that elevated serum total bile acid (TBA) plays a major role in the pathophysiology of PET. Since early onset ICP is considered to be associated with increased incidence of maternal and fetal complications, we hypothesized that early onset ICP (<32 weeks) may also result in an increased incidence of PET.

RESULTS: Twenty six women developed early onset ICP and 52 had late ICP. There were no significant differences in the age, gravity, ICP severity and TBA level.

The incidence of PET and severe PET among women with early and late onset ICP, both for singleton and twins, was similar ( CONCLUSIONS: Although our sample size is relatively small, the data suggest that once TBA accumulates in the serum it may result in PET later in pregnancy unrelated to onset time of ICP.

We examined MOD among women in our cohort, comparing pregnancies with IUGR to those without. IUGR was defined as estimated fetal weight less than the 10 th %. Exclusion criteria included multiple gestation, intrauterine fetal demise, placenta previa, non-cephalic presentation, and history of cesarean delivery (CD). The chi square test was used to compare proportions and p <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Our cohort of women with severe pre-e at 25-34 weeks gestation who underwent IOL included 137 women. Among this cohort, 24 women (17.5%) had IUGR. There was no difference in rates of VD with or without IUGR (57.5% vs 54.2%, p=0.76). There was also no difference in rates of VD among nulliparous women with and without IUGR (50.0% vs 48.7%, p=0.93). There were no statistically significant differences in MOD by presence or absence of IUGR when stratified by GA at delivery (Tabe 1). There were no observed differences in key neonatal outcomes (Apgars, cord pH, discharge status, birth weight) or maternal events (PPH, atony, abruption, seizure, length of stay, readmission, mortality) by ultimate MOD and presence or absence of IUGR. Most common indications for CD were fetal intolerance 28% and failed induction 7.1%. Worsening pre-e was an indication for CD in only 2.1% of cases. *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of women induced for severe pre-e before 34 weeks who ultimately deliver vaginally does not vary significantly by the presence or absence of IUGR. Our data suggests that IUGR is not associated with a decreased chance of successful VD or worse neonatal or maternal outcomes in preterm women with severe pre-e.",

Sonia Teoh, 1,2 Yao Wang, 1,2 Ying Li, 1,2 Qi Chen, 3 Guiying Nie. proteases are a family of serine proteases conserved from bacteria to mammals, and are known to have important functions in protecting cells from stress conditions. There are four mammalian HtrA paralogs (HtrA1-4). HtrA1 is involved in apoptosis and anoikis, and is proposed to function as a tumour suppressor. It has also been implicated in the development of other diseases such as arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, age-related macular degeneration, and cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy. We have previously shown that HtrA1 is highly enriched in the placenta compared to other tissues, and that in women HtrA1 is expressed in placental and endometrial cells at the placental-maternal interface during the first trimester of pregnancy. HtrA1 has recently been reported to be upregulated in preeclampsia (PE), a pregnancy-specific systemic disorder primarily involving hypertension and proteinuria, typically occurring after 20 weeks of gestation in previously normotensive women. However, it is unclear whether HtrA1 is secreted into the maternal circulation and if serum HtrA1 is altered in preeclamptic pregnancies.",

RESULTS: Using this assay, we discovered that serum HtrA1 levels increase progressively throughout gestation in normal pregnancies. However, this trend was perturbed in women with PE. Compared to gestation-age matched normal pregnancies, HtrA1 serum levels are significantly increased in early-onset PE, which occurs before 34 weeks of gestation, but significantly reduced in late-onset PE, which occurs after 34 weeks of gestation. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to show a clear increase of HtrA1 in the maternal circulation during normal pregnancy, consistent with HtrA1 being highly expressed in the placenta. This study also highlights the complex regulation of HtrA1 in different subsets of PE. TEG measures the viscoelasticity of clot formation and allows global assessment of hemostatic function. Therefore TEG is a standard test for diagnosis management and treatment of acute bleeding and coagulopathies. The aim of this study is to describe the coagulopathy of patients with AFE and PPH by using TEG. METHODS: This is multicenter retrospective study. We compared blood clot formation analysis by TEG in women with a diagnosis of AFE and compared it to women with PPH. All women in both groups had clinical or laboratory findings of Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC). TEG parameters were compared between AFE and PPH groups by using Mann-whitney U nonparametric test, p<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: A cohort of 5 women with AFE and 7 women with PPH were included in the analysis. No significant demographical and obstetrical",
