This is the first report of the presence of A. caninum eggs in human feces, which may have a direct implication for the epidemiology of hookworm infection caused by this species.

This is especially common for plant nematodes that are commonly ingested during human feeding, such as a parasite of the genus Meloidogyne 41 , causing infected patients to present with eggs in their feces without completion of the parasite cycle. However, hookworm eggs have a single and very thin membrane that would most likely be destroyed during passage through the stomach of humans 42 . Thus, the morphological characteristics of A. caninum eggs make this hypothesis strongly untenable. In addition, by observing the stage of egg development under optical microscopy, there was an absence of embryonated eggs in the feces.

In fact, many studies report the presence of hookworm eggs in food 43, 44 and also in water 45 .

In fact, migration of the hookworm larvae into skeletal muscles has also been reported in an individual with a large cutaneous exposure, with recovery of third-stage larvae within a muscle fiber 50 . Normally, infection with this nematode occurs by the ingestion of filarioid larvae or penetration of these larvae into the skin of animals 3, 4 . To complete their development, larvae need to be able to produce various enzymes involved in connective tissue degradation, such as hyaluronidases, which are often species specific 5, 51, 52 . Could this indicate the adaptation of the larvae of this species, which in recent times have been able to infect humans?
