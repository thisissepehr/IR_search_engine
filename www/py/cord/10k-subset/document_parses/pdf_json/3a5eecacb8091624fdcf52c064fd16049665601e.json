Determining an association between the clinical factors at the time of hospital admission and prognosis may be useful for timely and adequate consultation and treatment. It has been difficult to obtain these clinical factors adjusted with other confounding factors, such as age and sex, as published studies of H5N1 virus infection usually reported only a few cases. So, we performed a pooled analysis of the reported cases. Methods Five case reports (36 patients \\18 years of age) of H5N1 infection from four countries published between 2004 and 2009 were assessed based on available individual clinical data. Using the pooled data for all patients, we investigated the associations between patients' prognosis and available laboratory findings, such as white blood cell (WBC) counts, platelet (PLT) counts, and serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) by adjusting for age and/or sex. Results The linear regression analysis revealed that mortality was negatively associated with WBC and PLT counts adjusted with age and sex. Increased log AST tended to be associated with a poor prognosis (p = 0.054), but there was no significant association between survival and log ALT level.

The median time from onset to admission was 6 days in the pooled data.

Significant variations in patterns that may reflect differences in exposure related to social behavior, cultural and religious practices, access to care, and treatment or virulence of the viruses among countries have been pointed out in previous reports [4] . With respect to the virulence of viruses, viruses capable of infecting humans have been divided into groups from clades and subclades 0, 1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 7 from the phylogenetic tree for the hemagglutinin gene of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses. Clade 1 viruses were found to predominate in Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia in the early phase of the outbreak (2004) (2005) , and clade 2.1 viruses are endemic in Indonesia (2005) (2006) . Clade 2.2 viruses were associated with the outbreak of avian infection in Central and South Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Africa and with human infection in western Asia, the Middle East, and Africa (including the Turkish outbreak from 2005 to 2006). The median time from onset to hospitalization were found to be unchanged among clades [11] .
