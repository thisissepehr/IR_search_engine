            "text": "Acute kidney injury continued to be hot topic in 2011. Early diagnosis remains an issue of increasing importance, with the aim being to install early preventive measures in critically ill patients. Several very promising biomarkers turned out to have serious limitations in specific disease states, e.g. NGAL in septic shock [1, 2] . Cystatin C is another biomarker that is presumed to allow the early detection of small declines in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), but may also reflect tubular damage if measured in the urine. Royakkers et al. [3] investigated both urine and serum cystatin c in a multicentre prospective observational trial including 151 patients, and could not detect any diagnostic value for urinary cystatin c, only a very moderate performance of serum cystatin c for the prediction of AKI (AUC 0.72), and a very poor one for predicting the requirement for renal replacement therapy RRT (renal replacement therapy) (AUC B0. 66) . Serum cystatin C may also be futile as a biomarker for AKI (acute kidney injury) in the setting of renal obstruction [4] .",

They found that a RI [0.795 predicted persistent AKI with an OR of 1.85 (95% CI 1.2-2.85) upon applying logistic regression analysis. Considering the large influence of interobserver variability on this method, larger multicentre trials are required to prove the utility of this method in daily clinical practice.",

Increasing the target mean arterial pressure (MAP) from 60 to 75 mmHg resulted in significantly improved GFR (27%) and urinary output associated with increased oxygen delivery (13%) and reduced renal oxygen consumption. A further increase of MAP to 90 mmHg was ineffective or even detrimental for these parameters. The results indicate severely disturbed autoregulation of the kidney in vasodilatory shock and possible benefits from targeting a higher MAP of around 75 mmHg.",

[7] examined the incidence of contrast-media induced AKI (CI-AKI) in 787 predominantly surgical (*75%) patients. As opposed to data obtained from non-critically ill patients, the authors found a near-threefold increased incidence, with rates of between 16 and 23% depending on the definition used. Contrast-induced AKI was associated with a significantly increased length of stay, higher requirements for renal replacement therapy and mortality (1-year mortality 55.5 vs. 24% in patients without CI-AKI). Decreased renal function at the time of intervention, lower mean arterial pressure, vasoactive therapy, and administration of diuretics were found to be major risk factors for CI-AKI. This study, currently the largest of its kind, underlines the importance of nephrotoxic medication in this specifically vulnerable group of patients, and sets the stage for future randomised trials investigating effective preventive measures against CI-AKI.",

They found incidence rates of AKI of between 34 and 51%, demonstrating the high frequency of this complication in patients suffering from H1N1 infection. The occurrence of AKI was associated with a significantly increased risk of hospital mortality. Nin et al. specifically addressed the question of early AKI versus late AKI (after ICU day 2), and found a worse outcome for the latter, indicating that a large proportion of early AKI occurring in the context of H1N1 infection is presumably due to pre-renal factors like dehydration or hypotension, which can be easily corrected, resulting in rapid renal recovery. However, as demonstrated in accompanying correspondence by Nin et al. [10] , viral particles could also be found within renal tissue obtained from a few biopsies, which possibly contributed to AKI. These studies provide further insight into the pathophysiology of AKI in the setting of severe viral infections; it is most probably a mixture of pre-renal causes combined with endothelial damage and severe disturbance of the coagulation system caused by exaggerated inflammatory response and finally complicated by secondary bacterial infections. Direct renal effects of viral infiltration of the kidney, however, appear to be a very rare mechanism for AKI [11] .",

In the ICU, clinical assessment by bedside evaluation is of limited usefulness due to sedation or clinical severity. Transcranial Doppler is a useful screening tool for middle cerebral artery vasospasm, with less utility in evaluating other intracranial vessels, and computed tomographic perfusion may help predict vasospasm when used early during the clinical course [46] . Due to the difficulties involved in identifying SCV, several early markers that could be used to provide therapies focused on early brain damage signs have been search for, with the aims being to prevent but also reduce the intensity of later developing neurological complications [47] .

In this context, Zanier [49] investigated the concentrations of PTX3 and its relation with SCV in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 38 aSAH patients. PTX3 was elevated in all SAH patients in both plasma and CSF. Early, acute peak CSF PTX3 was significantly higher in patients who later developed vasospasm [median 13.6 (range 2.3-51.9) ng/ml] compared to those who did not [3.2 (0.1-50.5) ng/ml, p = 0.03]. The temporal pattern of CSF PTX3 in patients with vasospasm was triphasic, with a peak during the first 48 h after SAH, a subsequent decrease in the following 48-96 h, and a secondary significant increase with the occurrence of vasospasm. The measurement of CSF PTX3 can improve early diagnosis of this complication, and will be evaluated as a potential early biomarker in further researches. Even if we are improving in the identification of potential biomarkers to use as an early warning for CVS, this search is not yet concluded, and in the future we will probably ameliorate our comprehension in this exciting field.",

The physiological idea behind cerebral oxygen monitoring is that the PbrO 2 value accurately represents the balance between oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption in brain cells, and that changes in PbrO 2 will therefore reflect pathophysiological alterations. These changes could then be used to guide treatments to prevent or mitigate hypoxic injury [56] . PbrO 2 has been frequently monitored using a Licox system (LX, Integra Neuroscience, Biot, France), the only available device until a couple of years ago. Recently, a different manufacturer (Raumedic, M\u00fcnchberg, Germany) introduced a new probe, the Neurovent-PTO (NV). Dengler [57] compared the performance of the two systems in 11 comatose traumatic brain injury (TBI) or aSAH patients during dynamic changes in inspirational oxygen fraction and mean arterial pressure. PbrO 2 was recorded continuously in patients using the two probes which were placed side-by-side in the same cerebrovascular region. Once a steady baseline value was reached, FiO 2 was increased by 20% for 10 min. Once the baseline was again achieved, MAP was increased by 20 mmHg for 10 min. The PbrO 2 values of both probes differed significantly at all times. The LX probe reacted significantly faster to changes in FiO 2 and MAP. Limits of agreement ranged between -32.1 and 20.0 mmHg. Mean LX values were 6.1 mmHg lower than NV values. Even if the examined patient cohort was rather small, the data suggest that LX and NV probes measure different PbrO 2 values in routine monitoring as well as during phases of dynamic changes in FiO 2 and MAP. These data therefore do not support the view that both probes can be used interchangeably. The practical advice for the clinician is to be aware of the performance of the system they are using and to adapt treatment thresholds accordingly.",

The decrease in brain temperature assessed by MR was -1.7\u00b0C by spectroscopic imaging and -1.8\u00b0C by phase mapping at the end of 1 h of nasal cooling. The rectal temperature fell by 0.5\u00b0C. Thus, the simple nasal cooling technique had a substantial effect on brain temperature.",

The Italian Supreme Court granted the woman's father his wish to discontinue nutrition and hydration. The authors of this paper emailed a questionnaire to 70,000 physicians working for the Italian Public Health System and University Medical Hospitals. 22,219 doctors responded, representing a response rate of 32%. Approximately three-quarters had experience in treating patients in a persistent vegetative state. Approximately 60% of them considered tube feeding to be a medical therapy, and 66% believed that withdrawing artificial nutrition and hydration could be appropriate if based on the patient's wishes. There was broad consensus among Italian physicians that a clear legislative position regarding the withdrawal of artificial nutrition and hydration is needed.",

This study found that family members wanted a more active role in decision-making, in order to be able to communicate the values and preferences of the patient.

The vast majority of decisions to forego life support were discussed by clinicians and families during a formal family meeting, after which the medical staff generally made the final decision. The decision was almost always documented in the medical record. The majority of parents were informed of the final decision and were at the bedside during their child's death. Decisions were made to forego life-sustaining treatment in 41% of children who died, which was higher than the 33% seen in Eurydice I conducted in 2002, 6-7 years earlier. Eurydice II found that a higher percentage of parents were now informed about the meeting and its conclusion as compared with the earlier Eurydice I.

The authors used different modes of mechanical ventilation in rabbits, and demonstrated that mechanical ventilation using high volume and high pressure led to detrimental changes in the large proximal airway mucociliary system compared with lower tidal volume ventilation. Although a significant decrease in tracheal mucus secretion was noted across all ventilated groups, only animals ventilated with high pressures showed a significant reduction in ciliary beating frequency. The authors speculated that the mucociliary alterations occurred as a result of tissue hypoperfusion caused by mechanical ventilation with high pressures and high airway flows. An editorial [70] pointed out that the relevance of the observation is yet to be investigated in patients under mechanical ventilation. It is nevertheless important to understand the effects of changes in mucociliary clearance in the context of ventilator-induced lung injury that may alter host susceptibility to infections or prolonged intubations due to secretion retention.",

            "text": "It has been suggested that the airway pressure used in the mechanical ventilation of patients with ALI/ARDS should be in-between the low and upper inflection points of the pressure-volume (P-V) curve. During constant inspiratory flow, analysis of the airway pressure-time profile (P-t) can replace the static P-V curve [87] . From the mathematical point of view, the airway pressure can be described as a function of inspiratory time by the following equation: airway pressure = at b ? c, where the coefficient b, called the stress index, describes the shape of the P-t curve during a tidal breath. If b \\ 1, it means that the compliance increases, suggesting tidal recruitment; if b = 1, it suggests that the compliance does not change, while if b [ 1, it indicates compliance decreases, suggesting tidal overinflation [88] . Formenti et al. [89] tested the predictive ability of the stress index compared with quantitative lung CT scan in paralysed, mechanically ventilated pigs. The tests were conducted at PEEP values of 1 and 10 cm H 2 O in the absence and presence of pleural effusion by fluid instillation in pleural space. The investigators demonstrated a dissociation between the stress index, which suggested lung overinflation, and the CT scan, which showed lung recruitment. This observation suggests that the ability of the stress index to predict lung recruitment and overdistension was significantly reduced in the pathophysiological conditions. However, the authors did not measure the transpulmonary pressure in their study. An editorial [90] suggests that computation of the stress index as usually obtained from the airway pressure curve should be replaced by analysis of the transpulmonary pressure curve profile. In the heterogeneous airspace environment of ALI/ARDS, a reliable tool at the bedside to set desirable PEEP and VT is critical [91] . Traditional methods of monitoring lung mechanics using the pressure-volume curve, static compliance and the stress index have shown drawbacks, especially when the compliance of the chest wall is altered. Computed tomography (CT) scan is a powerful tool for mapping the distribution of the gas volume, but it is yet to be a part of bedside technology. The forced oscillation technique (FOT) may offer several potential advantages over traditional methods because it applies very small volume displacement, it minimises artifacts resulting from nonlinearity of the respiratory system, and it does not require deep sedation and muscle paralysis. Using FOT in a surfactant depletion model of ALI, Dellaca and colleagues [92] performed incremental and decremental PEEP trials, and measured both conventional and FOTderived respiratory system compliance at each step of PEEP changes. CT scan analysis was performed as a gold standard for monitoring lung compartments at end expiration. FOT was able to detect the minimal PEEP value needed to keep the lung open, and this was in good agreement with CT scan analysis with respect to sensitivity and specificity, suggesting that FOT may have potential value in defining adequate levels of PEEP to prevent/reduce the occurrence of de-recruitment. However, the validation of FOT to detect the extent of recruitment/de-recruitment and hyperinflation remains to be determined in more complicated clinical situations [93] . Variable ventilation is a new mode delivering volume-controlled ventilation with variation of the tidal volume around an average value. Pillow et al. [94] found that variable ventilation increased dynamic compliance but not static compliance or oxygenation in preterm lambs. They also found decreased PaCO 2 and concluded that variable ventilation was more efficient than conventional ventilation. The authors speculated that the lack of improvement in oxygenation between the groups was due to right to left shunt. However, one may argue that the pulmonary vascular resistance might have decreased with the observed improvement in compliance and reduced CO 2 levels, thus resulting in better pulmonary blood flow and oxygenation. Further investigations are needed to address the effects of variable ventilation in physiological and pathological conditions.",

Based on the aforementioned, Fierstra et al. [96] investigated whether this method would reduce the PET-aCO 2 gradient in a ventilated animal model. This technique led to a reduction in the PET-aCO 2 gradient, while the precision of PETCO 2 as a surrogate for PaCO 2 was independent of the PaCO 2 , PaO 2 , and SaO 2 as well as the extent of lung disease. Therefore, the end-inspiratory rebreathing technique may allow precise, noninvasive monitoring of PaCO 2 in ventilated patients, but further studies are required to identify the limitations of the method.",

            "text": "Bohr's dead space (VD Bohr ) measurement is commonly calculated using end-tidal CO 2 instead of the true alveolar partial pressure of CO 2 (PACO 2 ). Tusman et al. [97] compared the measurement of VD Bohr using PACO 2 derived from either volumetric capnography or the standard alveolar air formula. The authors concluded that VD Bohr can be calculated with accuracy using volumetric capnography. In a correspondence letter, Graf [98] expressed concerns about using Bohr's formula for measuring physiological dead space. The measurement may refer to airway (VD aw ) but not alveolar (VD alv ) fraction. The letter also argued that using CO 2 as a tracer of overall ventilatory efficiency still requires the measurement of VCO 2 , expired minute ventilation and PaCO 2 . The value of PaCO 2 may be increased by shunt and/or V/Q inequalities, leading to physiological dead space overestimation. This is an interesting topic, and more studies and discussion are encouraged to clarify this issue. Despite all of the technical advances of recent years, auscultation provides both useful physiological information and close patient-physician interaction. Today, there are automated systems that are available to detect, analyse, and interpret lung sounds. Image-based techniques of lung sound analysis such as vibration response imaging have been introduced and tested clinically. However, studies are warranted to determine their potential role in clinical practice. Vena et al. [99] report an analysis of the spectral characteristics of lung sounds. They observed significant correlation between intratidal recruitment measured with dynamic CT and the degree of crackles in the sound analysis, suggesting that air passage through atelectasis as well as poorly aerated areas is crucial for generating lung crackle sounds. They concluded that the computer-based analysis of crackle sounds is more sensitive for differentiating between small differences in healthy and injured conditions, especially at higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels, compared to conventional clinical auscultation. This simple and noninvasive technique of computer-based lung sound analysis may help intensivists monitor mechanical ventilation and diagnostic or therapeutic procedures such as recruitment manoeuvres in real time at the bedside. Yet the validation of the technique, and the variation of frequent measurements and interpretation of complex respiratory signals to optimise ventilator settings or to detect alveolar recruitment, especially in injured lungs, remain to be further investigated at the bedside [100] . Endotracheal tubes at high volume and low-pressure cuffs may fail to protect the lower airway from leakage of potentially contaminated secretions below the longitudinal folds. Ouanes et al. [101] studied the effects of PEEP levels, inspiratory effort intensity, peak pressures, tracheal tube cuff materials and sizes on the leakage of fluids past the cuff in an in vitro model of tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. The authors observed that leakage occurred more frequently at lower levels of PEEP, higher inspiratory efforts were associated with higher leakage, and polyurethane cuffs performed better than polyvinylchloride cuffs. In theory, most aspiration during mechanical ventilation occurs when tracheal pressure falls below hydrostatic pressure. Thus, the most important dependent variables are PEEP, inspiratory efforts and duty cycles. More studies are required to examine the effects of mechanical ventilation on leakage across the cuff.",

Severe neurological injury is associated with concurrent lung injury in clinical settings. Recent studies have shown that acute lung injury may be responsible for brain injury and poor neurocognitive outcomes. However, the underlying biological mechanisms are yet to be elucidated. Heuer et al. [103] evaluated the independent and combined effects of sustained acute intracranial hypertension (AICH) and ARDS on lung injury and brain damage in a porcine model. They observed that markers of lung injury were augmented with AICH and rose further with concurrent AICH/ARDS. These observations shed valuable light on the complex process of signaling, involving neural, inflammatory, immunological, and neuroendocrine pathways. The fundamental physiological mechanisms still need to be addressed in future studies investigating whether the brain injury was due to increased capillary permeability, and whether the brain edema was vasogenic or cytotoxic. Given the significant epidemiologic and mechanistic overlap between sepsis and ALI/ARDS, it seems plausible that some of the known effects of sepsis on the brain may be relevant to brain dysfunction encountered in ALI/ARDS [102] .",

[109] conducted a study in rats where lung tissue, lung lavage fluids and serum samples were profiled from caecal ligation and punctureinduced sepsis and control groups using NMR and highresolution magic angle spinning detection. Predictive PLS-DA models were constructed based on the NMR spectra of the three types of biological samples and employed to diagnose sepsis in other samples. The authors further reported that the predictive power obtained by combining the three types of samples was 100%. An advantage of employing metabolomics for potential diagnosis is the utilisation of biofluids and/or easily accessible tissues. Because lung tissue collection is invasive, while sepsis often appears in critically ill patients, the use of lung tissue for metabolomic analysis is not practical at the bedside. Moreover, bacteria play a key role in sepsis, particularly in conditions like peritonitis-associated sepsis. However, bacterium-related information was absent from their study. Therefore, the diagnostic value of the clinical treatment provided by this study is limited. Future studies may need to include urine samples for metabolomic analysis in order to understand bacterium-specific metabolites.",

            "text": "In the search for treatments for critical illnesses, levosimendan has been found to be interesting candidate, as it is a potent stimulator of vascular ATP-dependent potassium channels (K ? -ATP channels), inducing systemic vasodilation and reducing afterload. Schwarte et al. [114] examined the effect of levosimendan on cardiac output and tissue perfusion in the presence of hypoxia in a canine model. They found that when levosimendan was infused before hypoxia was induced, myocardial contractility, stroke volume and cardiac output were preserved in spite of the hypoxic insult. The novelty of this study is the examination of the antagonising effect of glibenclamide on the action of levosimendan. When given alone, glibenclamide caused a rise in systemic vascular resistance, suggesting that glibenclamide was acting to block K ? -ATP channels. When levosimendan was administered in the presence of glibenclamide, levosimendan caused a significant rise in cardiac output by improving myocardial contractility. This is indicative of levosimendan acting through a calcium-sensitising effect rather than on K ? -ATP channels. In a separate study, Revermann et al. [115] reported that the administration of levosimendan and nicorandil (a K ? -channel opener) attenuated the increased pulmonary vascular medial wall thickness in a model of pulmonary hypertension induced by monocrotaline challenge. Levosimendan significantly diminished the proliferation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells, and this effect was attenuated by glibenclamide. In cell culture, levosimendan had a direct inhibitory effect on the platelet-derived growth factor induced proliferation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells. These findings of levosimendan exerting inotropic, vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory properties under experimental conditions are exciting, but the real promise for levosimendan as a therapeutic candidate to support critical illness remains to be elucidated. Further in vitro and animal studies are required to understand the vasodilatory action of levosimendan, and the consequent effects-positive or negative-on end-organ perfusion [116] . Acute kidney injury is a common complication in patients with sepsis.",

            "text": "The primary resuscitation strategy for these patients is fluid resuscitation to improve organ perfusion and oxygenation and thereby prevent distal organ failure. Legrand et al. [117] examined the effects of fluid resuscitation on renal perfusion in relation to renal microcirculatory function in endotoxemic rats. The authors observed that infusion of endotoxin resulted in altered microvascular perfusion and oxygenation distributions. Early fluid resuscitation greatly improved renal perfusion compared to late resuscitation, but it did not influence oxygenation distribution. Serum cytokine levels decreased in the resuscitated groups, no matter whether early or late resuscitation was involved. Although the results are interesting, one has to keep in mind that the study was conducted at 300 min after endotoxin administration, and it is unknown whether this time frame is long enough to fully assess the therapeutic value of immediate versus delayed resuscitation in clinical situations. There are several issues that need to be addressed in future studies. For example, the volume and rate of fluid administration could simply have altered the disposition of endotoxin in the kidney. It is unclear how dramatic differences in aortic and renal artery flow and microvascular flow between endotoxin alone and endotoxin with fluid resuscitation had no impact on microvascular oxygen tension. Since the human erythropoietin fusion protein (EPO) gene was cloned over 25 years ago, several variants of the EPO molecule have been developed to improve its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics and to separate its haemopoietic and neuroprotective properties [118] . For example, carbamylated erythropoietin fusion protein (cEPO-FC) contains two recombinant human EPO (rhEPO) molecules connected by the Fc region of human IgG 1 , and is thought to improve the cytoprotective effects while reducing side effects including hypertension and thrombosis. Simon et al. [119] report that pretreatment with a cEPO-FC is as effective as rhEPO in ameliorating spinal cord injury in a porcine model of acute spinal cord ischaemia and reperfusion. This study assessed short-term outcomes, including motor-evoked potentials and histological damage. Future studies will need to focus on the longer-term neurological outcomes and demonstrate an absence of systemic toxicity, including thrombosis. It is noteworthy that clinical studies raised the possibility that rhEPO could improve some clinical outcomes, including neuronal recovery, but rhEPO failed to show any clinical benefit with respect to the Barthel index, modified Rankin scale and mortality rate in patients with stroke [120, 121] . Thus, further experimental and clinical research is needed to determine if derivatives of rhEPO such as cEPO-FC can improve long-term neurological outcome without having potential adverse effects such as hypertension, thrombosis and mortality. Reactive oxygen species are produced by activated neutrophils during the inflammatory response to stimuli such as endotoxins, can directly or indirectly injure host cells, and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS. Hassett et al. [122] described the result of pulmonary overexpression of superoxide dismutase in the response to endotoxin administration in animals. Endotoxin produced a severe lung injury compared to a sham injury. Their results support the conclusion that superoxide dismutase plays an important role in lung injury in terms of neutrophil infiltration, cytokine responses, lung edema and histology. However, the delivery technique for the superoxide dismutase transgene-using adeno-associated virusremains controversial. The conclusion that gene therapy may be appropriate for ALI is a bit premature and need further studies.",

Zymosan-induced generalised inflammation reproduces the characteristics of human MODS, and has been used to evaluate new therapies [140] . Rinaldi et al. investigated the effects of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) exposure on the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLR) 2 and 4, on their signal transduction, and on organ dysfunction during zymosan-induced MODS. They reported that the anti-inflammatory effect of HBO is associated with the inhibition of TLR signaling, and suggest that HBO therapy is effective at reducing systemic inflammation and associated organ dysfunction in this model [141] .",

However, so far, no in vivo study has evaluated whether ascorbic acid administration benefits defibrillation and resuscitation. Therefore, Tsai et al. [144] , in a rat model of ventricular fibrillation and electrical shock, observed that the intravenous administration of ascorbic acid at the start of cardiopulmonary resuscitation reduced lipid peroxidation and myocardial necrosis, diminished mitochondrial damage, facilitated resuscitation, and improved outcome.
