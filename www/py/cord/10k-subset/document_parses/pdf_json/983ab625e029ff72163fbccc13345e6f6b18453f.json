Based on findings from the 2009 A H1N1 pandemic in the National Capital Region (NCR), this paper presents a recovery analysis for workforce disruptions using economic input-output modeling. The model formulation takes into consideration the dynamic interdependencies across sectors in an economic system in addition to the inherent characteristics of the economic sectors. From a macroeconomic perspective, the risk of the influenza disaster can be modeled using two risk metrics. First, there is the level of inoperability, which represents the percentage difference between the ideal production level and the degraded production level. Second, the economic loss metric represents the financial value associated with the reduced output. The contribution of this work revolves around the modeling of uncertainties triggered by new perturbations to interdependent economic sectors within an influenza pandemic timeline. We model the level of inoperability of economic sectors throughout their recovery horizon from the initial outbreak of the disaster using a dynamic model. Moreover, we use the level of inoperability values to quantify the cumulative economic losses incurred by the sectors within the recovery horizon. Finally, we revisit the 2009 NCR pandemic scenario to demonstrate the use of uncertainty analysis in modeling the inoperability and economic loss behaviors due to time-varying perturbations and their associated ripple effects to interdependent economic sectors.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Disasters can have devastating effects on physical and economic systems. Specifically, infectious biological disasters, whether they are natural (e.g., SARS, influenza pandemics, and other recent disease outbreaks) or man-made (e.g., bioterrorism), can have devastating consequences if not managed properly (Hawryluck et al. 2005; Bartlett 2006 ). Seasonal disease outbreaks are considered natural hazards that occur periodically based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC 2014) . In more severe cases, an influenza pandemic disaster may render significant damage to the sectors of a given regional economic network. In the wake of an influenza pandemic, workforce productivity is highly impacted since employees are unable to come to work and opt to stay at home either because they are sick or because they take care of other family members. Such situation creates a state of dysfunctionality of economic systems since workforce is a critical component to the creation of output for practically all economic sectors. The extent of the impact of workforce disruption depends on the level of availability on the workforce. Moreover, the inherent interdependencies may generate ripple effects across the economic sectors. In an interdependent economic setting, some sectors rely on the output of other sectors for ideal production. Therefore, a given sector in a dysfunctional state means that it cannot meet its ideal production level and will fail to provide the necessary resources for other sectors to meet their ideal production. Thus, the cascading effect of the influenza pandemic will reduce the production of goods and services within the general economy. Pandemic disaster risk analysis has gained increasing attention lately especially with the recent outbreaks of infectious diseases, which resulted in significant disruptions and considerable economic losses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 307, "end": 330, "text": "(Hawryluck et al. 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 331, "end": 344, "text": "Bartlett 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 473, "end": 506, "text": "Control and Prevention (CDC 2014)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction and background"}, {"text": "This research traces the impacts of influenza pandemic on economic sector workforce by modeling and quantifying the level of dysfunctionality of workforce and associated economic consequences.

Several policies related to disaster risk management and emergency response have been adopted to help avoid the devastating consequences from extreme events (Department of Homeland Security 2008 , 2009 President of the United States 2003 . A disaster such as influenza pandemic may have devastating effects on interdependent workforce sectors. Therefore, it is important to understand the scope of the effects of pandemic on critical economic systems. Influenza pandemics can be characterized using two parameters: attack rate and basic reproduction number R 0 . The attack rate measures the proportion of people who have contracted the virus in a given population. The basic reproduction number R 0 measures the expected number of new individuals who contract the virus given their contact with one infected individual (Germann et al. 2006 ). An influenza pandemic could cause substantial reductions in the availability of workforce sectors due to their illness or the necessity of providing care for other family members. Such scenario may lead to economic disruptions across many regions and economic sectors. The extent of disruptions depends on factors such as the percentage dependence of a sector on the workforce, as well as the resilience of that sector. Also, sectors may be ranked differently in light of the two risk metrics to be explored in subsequent sections of this paper, namely the level of inoperability and economic loss. It is also possible to encounter unexpected perturbations throughout the recovery trajectory of the economic sectors. Therefore, it is essential to model the adverse effects of pandemics given the significant losses that may be incurred by such disasters.

It turned out to be more aggressive than the typical seasonal influenza and caused hospitalizations of children and adults as well as people with chronic conditions (World Health Organization 2010; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2010; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2012). Halder et al. (2010) estimate that the H1N1 influenza had an attack rate between 27 and 37 % with an average of 32.5 %. Also, the influenza pandemic reached its peak within 45 days and caused an illness rate of 6.6 % of the total population. The 2009 H1N1 was estimated to have a value of R 0 ranging from 1.4 to 1.6 (Fraser et al. 2009 ). As far as the estimated consequences of the 2009 H1N1 influenza on the workforce, the Canadian Labor Statistics Center reported in November 2009, 9 % of total national workforce lost almost 20 work hours for the month of November (Statistics Canada 2013). Many researchers have studied the difference between H1N1 pandemic and seasonal influenza in terms of the number of workdays lost and absenteeism rates. The number of workdays lost varies with age and susceptibility to the infection. Specifically, a person who is younger and more illness prone will have a higher likelihood of contracting the virus. It has been estimated that the absenteeism rate and the total workdays missed due to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic are significantly higher than due to seasonal influenza. This suggests that influenza pandemics pose higher risks to the workforce and economic systems. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic resulted in 0.2 % of total workdays lost per year, compared to the seasonal influenza that usually causes a loss of 0.08 % of total annual workdays (Schanzer et al. 2011 ). On the average, the H1N1 pandemic caused a loss of 25 work hours, whereas the seasonal influenza work hours lost are about 14. Moreover, the absenteeism rate due to the H1N1 pandemic was estimated to be around 13 % of total workers, while the seasonal influenza absenteeism rate is around 12 % (Schanzer et al. 2011) . The most impacted sector in the aftermath of the H1N1 pandemic was the medical and nursing services. Specifically, 56.6 % of the medical staff estimated having lost more than 1 day of work.

The study used two metrics to assess the consequences associated with influenza pandemic, namely the level of inoperability and economic loss. Inoperability is a dimensionless metric ranging from 0 (ideal scenario) to 1 (total failure), which measures the extent to which an economic sector is underperforming relative to the ideal scenario. In contrast, economic loss evaluates the actual financial consequence associated with the degraded production level of the sector. The findings show that values of the inoperability level for the peak time period range from 0.3 to 12.66 %, while the cumulative economic loss for all sectors ranges from $5.2b to $9.4b. These results have been found to be compatible with independent estimates made by the World Health Organization (2003). Germann et al. (2006) studied influenza propagation in the USA through modeling simulation based on several values of R 0 , the basic reproductive number, measuring the expected number of individuals who contract the virus by getting in contact with an infected individual. The simulation was carried for different levels and combinations of mitigation strategies such as vaccines, antivirals, and social restrictions. Results show that for relatively mild pandemics, large implementation of vaccination can decrease the number of ill people to \\10 %.

To quantify the magnitude of the reduction in productivity of the economic sectors, we use the inoperability level and economic loss metrics.

The level of inoperability is assumed to diminish as time progresses due to the economic resilience of the sectors.
