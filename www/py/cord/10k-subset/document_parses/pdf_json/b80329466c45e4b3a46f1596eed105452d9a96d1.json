Episodes of acute asthma in schoolchildren were associated with a respiratory virus infection in 80\u00b185% of cases and of viruses detected, 50% were rhinoviruses (RV) [1] . In adult asthma 44% of asthma exacerbations were associated with virus infections \u00b1 again the majority were rhinoviruses [2] . In addition to these two studies which were both carried out in the community, timeseries analysis was used to investigate more severe asthma exacerbations leading to hospital admissions. Virus infection was again strongly implicated in all age groups [3] . Further studies using sensitive methods of virus detection (PCR) for all the common respiratory virus types are underway in adults both in the community and admitted to hospital \u00b1 preliminary results suggest that virus infection is associated with the majority of asthma exacerbations in both settings.",

Peaks of allergen exposure can clearly cause exacerbations if the levels of allergen are high enough, as in the cat-allergic subject entering a home with cats, and in the well-publicized epidemics associated with soya bean exposure, or thunderstorm asthma. However, in most exacerbations where no virus is identified, the cause of the exacerbation is not clear. Some clues may have emerged from our recent studies on hospital admissions and asthma mortality. In the mortality study we observed a summer peak in asthma mortality in the 5\u00b144 years age group that was unexplained [5] . We hypothesized that this may be related to exposure to fungal allergens, as this has been reported previously in association with near asthma deaths [7] . Interestingly, we observed a similar peak in summer for hospital admissions for asthma in adults aged 16\u00b145 years [8] , and are currently in the process of analysing the possible role of fungal allergens in this population.",

            "text": "Although high-dose oral steroids are partially effective at treating asthma exacerbations, it is at the expense of major side-effects. Their use in children is undesirable for this reason, and many adults become relatively steroid-resistant as their disease progresses. The use of regular low-dose inhaled steroids for prevention is unfortunately ineffective [9] . There is therefore an urgent need for the development of an effective treatment for virus-induced asthma. Antiviral therapy has been disappointing, as there are major obstacles to the development of effective antiviral therapy, not least, the rapid emergence of resistant strains [10] . An alternative approach to the therapy of virus-induced asthma is to define the factors that lead to the development of an asthma exacerbation in an asthmatic subject in terms of host responses to the viral infection. A non-asthmatic subject undergoing a viral infection will develop principally upper respiratory symptoms, frequently a cough, but little else in the way of lower respiratory symptoms. If the factors leading to the development of lower airways inflammation can be identified, these factors would represent targets for the development of specific therapy aimed at reducing the impact of virus-induced asthma exacerbations. A clear understanding of the mechanisms of virus-induced asthma exacerbations, and the differences from the response of a normal subject to the same infection, will lead to the identification of such targets. Our understanding of both responses is at present very limited.",

The warmer temperatures (37 8C) of the lower respiratory tract are considered less conducive to virus replication; it has therefore been argued that RV does not replicate in the lung. However, there is increasing evidence that RV is capable of infecting the lower respiratory tract. We and others have demonstrated replication of RV in human alveolar and bronchial epithelial cell lines in vitro at 37 8C [11\u00b113], suggesting that the temperature conditions and cell types present in the lower respiratory tract permit RV replication under laboratory conditions. Observations made in our department during bronchoscopy of human volunteers experimentally infected with RV-16 revealed marked redness of the throat and trachea with patchy erythema around and beyond the carina, suggesting lower airways infection was likely.",

However, there was no difference between normal or asthmatic subjects in the lymphocyte response, suggesting that if lymphocytes are important in differentiating normal from asthmatic responses, then the difference is not likely to be in the number of infiltrating cells, but in the phenotype of the cells. Respiratory virus infections normally promote CD4 + Th1 and CD8 + Tc1 responses with production of IFN-g and IL-2 which have antiviral activities via proliferation of natural killer cells. Th2 or Tc2 responses are thought to be important in asthma pathogenesis, acting via production of IL-4 promoting isotype switching to IgE production, and IL-5 production and the promotion of eosinophilic inflammation. There are clear data to demonstrate that such responses can be produced by viral infections in certain conditions in animal models [22] , and that CD8 + T cells may be important in regulating this response [23] . However, there is little data to corroborate these findings in human virus infections\u00b1in atopic subjects during RV infections, there is some evidence that a Th2-like response may occur with production of IL-5 [24] .

We have carried out in vitro studies to demonstrate that RV infection of respiratory epithelial cells induces its own receptor, ICAM-1 [25] . ICAM-1 is important in the pathogenesis of asthma, and its increased expression by RV infection may play a role in the retention and activation of intraepithelial lymphocytes, and eosinophils. Furthermore, the same studies demonstrated epithelial cell expression of VCAM-1, and its upregulation by RV infection via increased activity of members of the GATA transcription factor family [25] . VCAM-1 is specifically important in eosinophil infiltration by interacting with its ligand VLA-4, and factors regulating its expression may therefore represent targets for therapeutic intervention, however, before firm conclusions about its importance in virus-induced asthma can be drawn, in vivo studies are required to confirm the findings of the in vitro studies.",

For example, RANTES is a potent eosinophil chemoattractant and activator, and its levels are increased in nasal aspirates from children with virus-induced exacerbations of asthma [26] . RANTES production is increased in RV-infected bronchial epithelial cells in vitro [27] , and chemokine receptor expression, and the response of the epithelial cells to chemokine stimulation are also both increased [28] . Local autocrine/paracrine activation of epithelial cells by RV infection, mediated by chemokines, may therefore play a prominent role in virus-induced asthma exacerbations. Once again however, these findings need to be confirmed in vivo, and their relative importance in asthmatic and normal subjects investigated, before chemokines can be put forward as candidate targets for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, the above findings relate to a single chemokine, while there are other new chemokines with potent effects on eosinophil chemoattraction and activation, such as eotaxin and MCP-4 [29] .",

Little is known in this regard, however, we have recently assayed several cytokines in nasal lavage from normal and atopic subjects during wild type viral infections, and have found significantly reduced induction of IL-10 in the atopic subjects compared with the normal subjects (J. Corne, P. H. Howarth and S. L. Johnston, unpublished data).

Recent studies suggest that levels of NO are increased in relation to bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), in response to allergen challenge and are reduced by steroid therapy, suggesting (but not proving) a harmful role for NO in asthma. Recent studies, however, suggest that NO may have a protective role in virusinduced airway hyperresponsiveness. De Gouw et al. [30] have found a relationship between rhinovirus-induced increases in NO levels and protection from increased BHR in experimental rhinovirus infections. Folkerts et al. [31] previously showed the same during parainfluenza virus type 3 infections in guinea-pigs, and that infusion of a NO donor protected against virus-induced BHR. Finally, Sanders et al. [13] have shown that NO donors reduced rhinovirus-induced cytokine release from a bronchial epithelial cell line, and that NO has antirhinoviral activity in vitro. These data suggest that NO donors may represent a new therapeutic approach in virus-induced asthma.",

We have therefore started to examine the mechanisms of rhinovirus induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules, in order to determine if there is a common mechanism such as transcription factor activation. We have demonstrated that rhinovirus-induction of IL-8 occurs via activation of the transcription factors AP-1 and NFkB [32] , as does RS virus-induction of IL-8 [33] , while that of ICAM-1 occurs via NFkB alone and that of VCAM-1 via NFkB and GATA [25] . Other workers have demonstrated that rhinovirus-induction of IL-6 also occurs via induction of NFkB [34] . These in vitro data suggest that inhibition of NFkB might suppress rhinovirus induction of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines and therefore reduce the severity of rhinovirus induced asthma exacerbations. Once again, the potential roles of these transcription factors has been suggested by in vitro studies, but in vivo confirmation is required.",

Identification of the important differences between asthmatic and normal subjects responses is of fundamental importance in the search for targets for therapeutic intervention. Studies are urgently required to investigate the potential mechanisms by localizing virus infection in the lower airway in conjunction with implicated biological molecule detection and cell influx using in-situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, PCR and ELISA in bronchial lavage and biopsies from experimentally infected subjects.

Most studies carried out so far have studied the effects of rhinovirus. However, our clinical studies suggest that there is very little difference in the capacity of each of the different virus types to induce asthma exacerbations [1] . It is therefore important to determine whether mechanisms identified as being important for rhinovirus virusinduced asthma exacerbations are also important in exacerbations induced by other viruses such as those listed above. This will have major implications in determining the percentage of asthma exacerbations that could potentially be treated by any therapy stemming from the studies carried out with rhinovirus.",
