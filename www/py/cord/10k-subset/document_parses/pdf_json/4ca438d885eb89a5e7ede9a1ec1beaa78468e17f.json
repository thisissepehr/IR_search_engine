We therefore set out to quantify, in a population-based adult general population cohort, the possible protection against acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) conferred by a person's self-perceived hand-washing frequency. Methods: During the pandemic influenza season from September 2009 through May 2010, a cohort of 4365 adult residents of Stockholm County, Sweden, reported respiratory illnesses in real-time. A questionnaire about typical contact and hand-washing behaviour was administered at the end of the period (response rate 70%). Results: There was no significant decrease in ARI rates among adults with increased daily hand-washing frequency: Compared to 2-4 times/day, 5-9 times was associated with an adjusted ARI rate ratio (RR) of 1.08 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87-1.33), 10-19 times with RR = 1.22 (CI 0.97-1.53), and \u226520 times with RR = 1.03 (CI 0.81-1.32).

Cluster-randomized non-blinded intervention trials, sometimes combining hand hygiene with wearing of face masks, in households with newly infected index cases generally failed to statistically confirm protective effects on primary outcomes [3] [4] [5] , but some found significant protection in subgroups that started intervention early [5, 6] . Public health intervention trials with clusterrandomization in more or less confined population segments have yielded a similar overall pattern of results with a mix of positive studies [3, [7] [8] [9] and studies with non-significant effects on the primary outcome but some positive findings in subgroup analyses [3, [10] [11] [12] [13] . Almost unavoidable limitations, including Hawthorne effects and outcome information bias, make the results unpersuasive.

Hospital-based case-control studies of SARS and severe influenza, limited by their inherent uncertainty as to the controls' representativity of the population strata that generated the cases, and the possibility of recall bias, provide the most consistent support for a protective effect of frequent hand-washing [3, 14] .

Another is that frequent hand-washing is more efficient on the population level when it is practiced by those who are already sick, and less efficient when practiced by healthy individuals.

It is reasonable to assume that members of the surveillance cohort were, on average, more health conscious than the average individual in the population. The high vaccination coverage might signal such health consciousness. If they zealously engaged in other preventive measures, e.g. avoiding contacts with sick people, the scope for an effect of hand-washing might have been limited. On the other hand, this selected group probably also conscientiously reports ARI symptoms and thus strengthens the internal validity of the study. Additionally, since the group with no, or next to no, handwashing was too small to serve as a separate category, let alone as reference in our analyses, we could not shed light on whether hand-washing had an effect on ARI risk compared to no hand-washing. The possibility of threshold effects in the lowest range of hand-washing activity must be entertained as must the possibility of effects on specific infectious agents as opposed to the syndromes measured in this study. Another important limitation is in the predictably substantial underreporting of the infectious outcomes [17] . Underreporting that is non-differential vis-\u00e0-vis the explanatory variables will not bias the risk-ratio estimate if the proportion with false positive reports is negligible [27] . A previous validation study confirmed that the false positive reporting is indeed insignificant [17] , but we cannot exclude the possibility that the underreporting was differential, i.e. that participants who washed their hands frequently were more prone to report disease to the surveillance system. The study could also be affected by social desirability bias, i.e. those who infrequently washed their hands exaggerated their hand-washing frequency more than those who frequently washed their hands, and this could have obscured the effect of hand-washing.
