            "text": "Background Influenza is an acute viral respiratory illness that causes high morbidity and mortality globally. Therapeutic actions are limited to vaccines and a few anti-viral drugs. Polygala (P.) japonica herba is rich in Polygalasaponin F (PSF, C 53 H 86 O 23 ), used for acute bronchitis, pharyngitis, pneumonia, amygdalitis, and respiratory tract infections treatment in China. Hypercytokinemia is often correlated with severe pneumonia caused by several influenza viruses. PSF was reported to have anti-inflammatory effects and its mechanism is associated with the nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB signaling pathway. The action of PSF to alleviate pulmonary inflammation caused by influenza A virus (IAV) infection requires careful assessment. In the present study, we evaluated the effect and mechanism of PSF on mice with pneumonia caused by influenza H1N1 (A/ FM/1/47). Methods Mice were infected intranasally with fifteen 50% mouse lethal challenge doses (MLD 50 ) of influenza virus. BALB/c mice were treated with PSF or oseltamivir (oral administration) for 2 h post-infection and received concomitant treatment for 5 days after infection. On day 6 post-infection, 10 mice per group were killed to collect related samples, measure body weight and lung wet weight, and detect the viral load, cytokine, prostaglandins, pathological changes, and cell pathway protein expression in the lungs. In addition, the survival experiments were carried out to investigate the survival of mice. The expression profile of cell pathway proteins was detected and analyzed using a broad pathway antibody array and confirmed the findings from the array by western blotting. Results Polygalasaponin F and oseltamivir can protect against influenza viral infection in mice. PSF and oseltamivir significantly relieved the signs and symptoms, reduced body weight loss, and improved the survival rate of H1N1-infected mice. Moreover, PSF efficiently decreased the level of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, IL-4, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2 ), and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) in lung tissues of mice infected with influenza virus (p < 0.05-0.01). Oseltamivir had a similar effect to lung cytokine of PSF, but did not decrease the levels of TXA 2 and PGE 2 . There was a twofold or greater increase in four cell pathway protein, namely NF-\u03baB p65 (2.68-fold), I-kappa-B-alpha (I\u03baB\u03b1) (2.56-fold), and MAPK/ERK kinase 1 (MEK1) (7.15-fold) assessed in the array induced by influenza virus. Western blotting showed that the expression of these proteins was significantly decreased in lung after influenza virus challenge in PSF and oseltamivirtreated mice (p < 0.05-0.01).",

            "text": "Polygala (P.) japonica herba, a traditional Chinese herb, has been used as an expectorant, antitussive, antibacterial, and ataractic agent (Zhang et al. 1996) . It is widely used in China to treat acute bronchitis, pharyngitis, pneumonia, amygdalitis, and respiratory tract infections in children (Zhou et al. 2015) . The compounds isolated from P. japonica so far mainly include saponins, flavonoids, xanthones, polysaccharides, etc. Saponins are one of the key components of P. japonica (Fu et al., 2008) . These activities may be due to the presence of various saponins in P. japonica, since studies have showed that the saponins found in P. japonica have antipsychotic, anti-inflammatory, and expectorant effects (Chung et al. 2002; Wang et al. 2008) . Polygalasaponin F (PSF, C 53 H 86 O 23 , Fig. 1 ) is a triterpenoid saponin and is also one of the major active constituents of P. japonica used for the quality control of the medicine (Zhou et al. 2015) . Previous research has reported that PSF has anti-inflammatory effects and its mechanism is associated with the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway (Wei et al. 2014; Yan et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2008) . Inflammation is associated with influenza. Importantly, hypercytokinemia is often correlated with severe pneumonia caused by several influenza viruses. When infected by influenza virus, the cytokines will be duplicated with the support of various cell-signaling pathways such as the changes in Raf/MEK/ERK, nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) induced by IAV (Ehrhardt et al. 2006) . Therefore, a reduction in cytokine expression and viral replications by interfering the signaling events is considered as a beneficial method to treat IAV infections. PSF has an important role in antiinflammatory activity and inhibition of (NF)-\u03baB Wei et al. 2014) . PSF may also have the potential to treat pneumonia induced by IAV. This study was designed to investigate whether PSF could provide protection against pneumonia caused by influenza virus. The mechanisms of PSF anti-influenza virus using high-throughput proteome array and western blotting were also discussed.",

This study assessed the effect of PSF on the mice infected by IAV.

These results indicated that PSF could effectively protect mice from IAV infection.",

            "text": "This study found that influenza virus induce viral pneumonia in mice characterized by interstitial congestion, edema, infiltration of inflammatory cells, pulmonary hemorrhage, and alveolar edema. The lung index and pulmonary vascular permeability appeared to progressively increase, suggesting that the increase of pulmonary vascular permeability is one of the early lesions. In the IAV-C group and the PSF treatment group, lung TXA 2 and PGE 2 levels showed a synchronous change trend with pulmonary vascular permeability, lung index, and lung pathological changes, suggesting that lung damage caused by IAV was closely related to the production of TXA 2 and PGE 2 . Prostaglandins [PGs, including prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ), PGD 2 , PGF 2\u03b1 , PGI 2 , TXA 2 ] are bioactive lipid mediators generated from arachidonic acid via the enzymatic activity of cyclooxygenases (COXs) and participate in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disease (Park et al. 2006; Davies et al. 1984) . TXA 2 is by far the strongest platelet aggregator and vasoconstrictor of vascular and bronchial smooth muscle (van Ooijen et al. 1990 ). TXA 2 constricts pulmonary vascular and bronchial smooth muscle, promotes platelet aggregation and secretion, and aggravates lung injury. In addition, TXA 2 can mediate the adhesion and aggregation of neutrophils, release harmful factors such as oxygen free radicals, leukotrienes, and platelet activating factors, thus aggravating lung damage (Westphal et al. 2005) . PGE 2 is the most abundant prostanoid in the mammalian body and plays a role in regulation of immune responses, blood pressure, gastrointestinal integrity, and inflammation (Coulombe and Divangahi 2014). PGE 2 acts as a mediator of pain and fever in inflammatory response and participates in the pathophysiological process of inflammation. All the classic signs of inflammation (swelling, redness, heat, and pain) can be attributed to PGE 2 (Funk 2001) . IAV hyper induces the COX-2 and PGE 2 production (Liu et al. 2012) . In this study, PSF can inhibit the release of TXA 2 and PGE 2 to a certain extent, thereby effectively alleviate the inflammatory response, which may be one of the mechanisms of anti-influenza effect of PSF. Our study showed that even if the viral replication have been suppressed in the mice treated with oseltamivir, levels of TXA 2 and PGE 2 were still similar to the IAV-C mice, which were significantly higher than those in the mice receiving PSF therapy. This finding suggests that once the viral infection has triggered the cytokine storm, Fig. 5 Effects of polygalasaponin F on lung TXA 2 and PGE 2 in mice infected with IAV (n = 10). The levels of TXA 2 and PGE 2 were analyzed in lung homogenates of mice on day 6 after infection by ELISA. Data were presented as mean \u00b1 SD. Asterisks denote the significance levels: *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001, compared with IAV-C group. a The level of PGE 2 in lung homogenate; b the level of TXA 2 in lung homogenate Values are mean \u00b1 SD. Asterisks denote the significance levels: *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001, compared with IAV-C group inflammatory cytokines will continue to drive the immunopathologic progression (Zheng et al. 2008 ) and antiviral therapy cannot completely inhibit this process. Influenza virus infection would activate intracellular signaling pathways to support efficient replications and Raf/MEK/ERK-cascade and NF-\u03baB would be activated by the influenza virus during the replications (Haasbach et al. 2013) . As the main regulator of influenza cytokines and chemokines production (e.g. TNF-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b2, IL-1 \u03b2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3), the activation of NF-\u03baB is a hallmark of host cells responding to influenza virus infection (Barnes and Karin 1997) . Overexpression of IAV-induced cytokines and chemokines is subjected to the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway (Barnes and Karin 1997) . The activation and inactivation of NF-\u03baB could directly regulate the transcription of inflammatory cytokines and adhesion factors such as interferon (IFN)-\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) (Chu et al. 1999) . These cytokines and adhesion factors are considered to have connection with acute lung injury (ALI) (Lee et al. 2005) . As previously studied, the nuclear translocation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB -dependent transcriptional activity can be inhibited by treating with PSF Wei et al., 2014) . The expression of NF-\u03baB p65 (major component of NF-\u03baB) and MEK1 had a significant decrease in the lung of IAV-infected mice after treated with PSF. PSF could inhibit signaling by Raf/MEK/ERK and NF-KappaB, which would interfere with the events and suppress virus production and inflammatory responses.",

Influenza virus infection triggers the cytokine storm and includes following hallmarks: excessive proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and inflammatory cells recruitment into lungs (La Gruta et al. 2007 ). Drugs with anti-inflammatory actions have controlled excessive inflammation from severe influenza in animal models such as the COX-2 inhibitor, naproxen (Lejal et al. 2013) .
