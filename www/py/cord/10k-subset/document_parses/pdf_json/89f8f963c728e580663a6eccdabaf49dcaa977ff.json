As a result, several very different time scales are simultaneously present in the model; this makes its analytical study an extremely difficult task. However, the significant difference of the time scales implies the existence of a possibility of the model order reduction through a process of time separation. In this paper we conduct the procedure of model order reduction for a reasonably simple model of RNA virus evolution reducing the original system of three integro-partial derivative equations to a single equation. Computations confirm that there is a good fit between the results for the original and reduced models.",

In order to be useful in biological research, a mathematical model should be based on explicitly stated basic principles, postulates and hypotheses and allow a transparent interpretation of both results and parameters. In other words, a useful model should be essentially mechanistic. This implies that in evolutionary biology such a model must include a combination of factors responsible for natural selection (which drives evolution) and a mechanism for describing evolution. However, the factors generating the selection pressure act on a time scale comparable with an average generation time, or a life span of a single entity, whereas evolution is a comparatively slow process of accumulation of small changes that progresses through many generations to be evident. As a result, the model unavoidably includes multiple time scales which differ by several orders of magnitude. Computational or analytical handling of such models usually is a highly non-trivial task. In the case of viral evolution this discrepancy is further complicated by the fact that a typical generation times of virus and the hosts differ by orders of magnitude as well.",

This mechanistic model is an extension of Nowak-May HIV model [6] , where viral phenotypes (strains) are assumed to be distributed in a continuous phenotype space, and random mutations are described by dispersion. For the sake of simplicity, Korobeinikov and Dempsey formulated the model on a basis of the 2-dimensional Wodarz-Christensen-Thomsen, or Wodarz, model [7] . The latter is a reduction of the original 3dimensional Nowak-May model under an assumption that the population of free virus particles is proportional to the infected cells population.

Thus, the original Nowak-May model combines three processes and three time scales, namely (i) the proliferation of the uninfected target cells, (ii) the infectious process and infected cells' life cycle, and, finally, (iii) free virus life cycle. In the Wodarz model, which was used as a basis for model in [5] , one of these processes, namely the free virus life cycle, is omitted and replaced by the assumption that the free virus population is proportional to the infected cells population. The latter makes the model slightly simpler. However, model in [5] includes evolution which occurs on a comparatively slow timescale. Accordingly, the model is a slow-fast system. The considerable differences of the timescales, which make the model difficult for both computer simulation and analysis, at the same time, indicate that the model can be simplified using the process known as time scales separation (for instance, see [8, 9, 10] ). In this paper we carry out such a scale separation. As a result, the model RNA virus evolution in [5] is reduced to a single equation. Simulations demonstrate that apart from a comparatively short transition period there is a good fit of results for both, the full and the reduced models.",

Let us assume now that multiple viral strains are possible and are distributed in a continuous phenotype space. For model (1) a viral variant is characterized by parameters \u03b1, k, c and m, and hence it could be assumed that the phenotype space is 4-dimensional. However, it is known (and we will demonstrate this further) that for the Nowak-May model (1) these parameters are not independent: as we mentioned, for this model the viral dynamics is completely characterized by the basic reproduction number R 0 which usually serves as a measure of the Darwinian fitness of the virus. In other words, in the framework of the Nowak-May model a viral phenotype is uniquely characterized by the single number R 0 , and, therefore, it suffices to consider a 1dimensional phenotype space M = {s \u2208 (0, \u221e)}. Then fitness R 0 is a function of variable s. (The graph of this function is usually referred to as a \"fitness landscape\" . In the Nowak-May model coefficients \u03b1, m, k and c are attributed to a phenotype, and hence these are function of s. We assume that \u03b1 = \u03b1(s) = \u03b1 0 \u03b1 0 (s), m = m(s) = m 0 m 0 (s), k = k(s) = k 0 k 0 (s) and c = c(s) = c 0 c 0 (s), where \u03b1 0 ,m 0 , k 0 and c 0 are coefficients of a wild strain (or a phenotype at the beginning of evolution), \u03b1 0 (s), m 0 (s), k 0 (s) and c 0 (s) are nondimensional functions and m 0 (s), k 0 (s), c 0 (s) = 1 for this wild phenotype.

This procedure corresponds to assumptions that (i) there is a stable slow manifold such that all solutions converge to this manifold, and hence (ii) the values of fast variables u(t) and x(t, s) converge to quasi-equilibrium values which slowly vary as the system progresses along the slow manifold [9] . Let \u03bd = 0, then equalityk (s)v =c(s)x holds. Substituting this equality into (3) and (4), we obtain equations",

To some extent this assumption is justified by the fact that for the Nowak-May model genotypes fitness is defined by a single number R 0 = \u03b1bk cmq . Under this hypothesis, and taking into consideration that R 0 is a function of all six parameters, it should make no difference which of these six parameters is varying in the phenotype space.

However, a combination of several time scales within a model suggests that such a model can be significantly simplified using the scale separation techniques. For ODE such technique is based on the famous Tikhonov's theorem. The mathematical models in evolutionary biology are usually formulated as integro-differential equations and PDE. However, with some reservations the same concepts can be applied to these equations as well (for instance, see [10, 16, 17] ). In this paper we execute the scale separation for a RNA virus evolution model which is based on the 3-dimensional Nowak-May model. As a result of this procedure, the original system of three integro-partial differential equations is reduced to a single integro-partial differential equation, describing the dynamics of infected target cells v(t, s). The other variables, namely the uninfected cells u(t) and free virus particles x(t, s), are expressed as explicit functions of variable v(t, s). Numerical simulations show an acceptable fit of the solution of the original and the reduced models.",
