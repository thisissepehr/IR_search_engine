            "text": "Backgroud: Organizing pneumonia (OP) is a rare complication of influenza infection that has substantial morbidity. We report the first case of OP associated with avian influenza H7N9 infection that had significant improvement with corticosteroid treatment. Case presentation: A 35-year-old male admitted to intensive care unit because of respiratory failure. He was diagnosed as severe pneumonia caused by avian influenza H7N9 viral infection. After initial clinical improvement supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), the patient's condition worsened with persistent fever, refractory hypoxemia. Chest x-rays and computed tomographies showed areas of consolidation and ground glass opacification. Although OP was suspected and 1 mg/kg methylprednisolone was used, the patient's condition didn't improved considerably. An open lung biopsy was performed, and histopathological examination of the specimen was compatible with OP. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg for 5 days. ECMO was weaned on day 15, and he was discharged on day 71 with good lung recovery. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this was the first case of successful management of refractory severe respiratory failure caused by avian influenza H7N9 infection complicated with OP. Refractory hypoxia with clinical manifestation and radiological findings compatible with OP, a differential diagnosis should be considered among patients at the second or third week of influenza H7N9 infection, especially in patients with clinical condition deteriorated after the primary influenza pneumonia was controlled. And a steroid dose of methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg may be suggested for treatment of OP associated with avian influenza H7N9 infection.",

Physical examination showed bilateral moist crackles. Laboratory tests showed white blood cell count (WBC) was 5.75 \u00d7 10 9 /L (and it became to 1.35 \u00d7 10 9 /L two days later), C reactive protein (CRP) was 13.3 mg/L, and procalcitonin (PCT) was<0.1 ng/ml. Chest x-ray and chest computed tomography (CT) showed bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGO) and consolidation (Fig. 1) . Moxifloxacin 400 mg daily was administered for two days. And his condition deteriorated with dyspnea and severe respiratory failure, and the blood gas analysis showed PaO 2 was 58 mmHg under oxygen mask with a FiO2 of 0.8. He was transferred to our intensive care unit (ICU) supported with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and intubated 3 h later. Mechanical ventilation with peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 32 cm H 2 O, positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 20 cm H 2 O and FiO 2 of 1.0 could not maintain the oxygenation. As his PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio less than 50 mmHg lasted for 3 h, the venovenous-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) was established. The microscopic examination, culture and galactomannan detection from serum and bronchial-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) for virus PCR, fungal, and the culture for bacteria and the microscopic examination for bacteria and tuberculosis were done at ICU admission. The nucleic acid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for influenza H7N9 virus of sputum specimen turned out to be positive and oseltamivir phosphate was initiated (150 mg twice daily for 2 weeks after the PCR of the virus were negative for two consecutive tests.). As the PCT rose to 4.84 ng/ml, and the galactomannan detection was positive (2.52 from serum sample and 1.21 from BALF sample), vancomycin, imipenem cilastatin and caspofungin were applied. Hydrocortisone 300 mg daily for 3 days was also used for septic shock.",

Considering no underlying cause of OP existed other than virus infection, therefore, OP associated with H7N9 influenza virus infection was suspected. Methylprednisolone 80 mg (1 mg/kg) daily was applied on day 17 for 5 days with tapering. With clinical improvement, the patient was extubated on day 21, and supported with NIV with a FiO 2 of 0.6.

Fever (27%, 3/11), dyspnea (36%, 4/11), cough (27%, 3/11) were the most common symptoms reported.

Steroid was the main treatment, varying from prednisolone 30 mg/day to methylprednisolone 500 mg/day pulse therapy, with or without tapering.

Now, for avoiding confusion with bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), the term organizing pneumonia (OP) is preferred [15] . In fact, OP is an nonspecific inflammatory response from human body towards acute lung injuries. It can be with idiopathic Considering symptomatology, physical signs, laboratory and pulmonary function tests, radiologic or histomorphological findings, there is no obvious difference between COP and secondary OP, excepting the latter may have higher mortality [16] . OP has been linked to multiple influenza viral infections including influenza A and B, but this is the first report of avian influenza H7N9-associated OP with relapse occurrence and severe respiratory failure. The main clinical features of our avian influenza H7N9-associated OP is similar to the cases of influenza A cases. In these cases reported, OP onset mostly at the second to third week in the course of influenza, and occurred after the releasing of primary virus infection; And the OP is complicated with respiratory failure, and no evidence of other pathogen was found; And the main findings on HRCT for this kind of OP were GGO and consolidation. Biopsy were done via TBLB or OLB at the third week. In cases with influenza associated OP, other than common findings of OP, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), alveolar hemorrhage and edema and bronchiolitis can also be found, showing the lung injury of primary virus infection. However, in our case, the patient present with high fever as a main manifestation of OP, and had a relapse of respiratory failure associated with OP. A differential diagnosis of OP should be considered at the second to third week after the primary infection among patients with influenza H7N9 infection. Furthermore, there was no clear evidence of bacterial and fungus infection during the beginning of hospitalization. However, the levels of PCT and galactomannan showed significant increase after the patient was established with ECMO. The OP may also be caused by the nosocomial infection which was frequently complicated with severe influenza pneumonia.",

However, up to one-third patients may relapse in tapering period. For the current patient with avian influenza H7N9associated OP, methylprednisolone 80 mg (1 mg/kg) daily was applied for 5 days with tapering in the beginning of suspicion of OP. The patient showed rapid clinical and radiological improvement and was extubated on the fifth day of steroids applying. However, the patient deteriorated with high fever and refractory hypoxemia 10 days later. With the confirmation of histological examination, steroid dose was increased to methylprednisolone 120 mg (1.5 mg/kg) daily for 5 days. And OP was finally controlled without relapsing in follow-ups. Insufficient initial dose of steroid may contributed to the relapsing of OP before final diagnosis. Therefore, Post avian influenza H7N9 infection OP may responsive to a brief course (weeks) of moderate-to-high dose prednisone therapy.",
