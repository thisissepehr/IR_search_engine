Although the incidence of HAIs in this study was lower than most previous publications, the trend was consistent. HAIs accounts for 3.5-9% of all infections in developed and developing countries [13] . Extensive studies in the USA and Europe showed that HAI incidence density ranged from 13.0 to 20.3 episodes per 1000 patient-days [14] . Incidence rates are higher in ICUs, affecting~30% of patients [15] .

Furthermore, elderly inpatients with HAIs have poor prognosis and increased economic burden [18] . One study evaluated elderly patients who had an HAI in the ICU and found that clinical outcomes of the elderly who acquired an infection in the ICU were influenced by sociodemographic and clinical variables that increase mortality rates [19] . Another study of HAI in elderly patients identified the following risk factors: advanced age; comorbid neurological and chronic noncommunicable diseases such as cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, brain neoplasms, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, malignant tumor and malignant hematonosis; hospital days before HAI; ICU admission; and device use [9] . The participants of that study were elderly \u226560 years with or without HAIs. To control for confounders and identify novel risk factors of HAI in this population, we investigated comorbidities and special medical procedures in elderly and non-elderly groups. The percentages of male patients, patients with comorbidities (e.g., cerebrovascular disease, brain neoplasms, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, COPD, malignant tumor, malignant hematonosis, and osteoarthropathy), and ICU admissions were significantly higher in the elderly group. Conversely, fewer elderly patients underwent surgery lower. These results suggest that the higher incidence of HAI in elderly may be attributable to the higher rates of comorbidities and special medical procedures in elderly inpatients. One of the primary concerns of the current investigation was identifying common HAIs sites in elderly inpatients. Most HAIs were found in the lower respiratory tract, urinary system, and bloodstream. These findings are consistent with other available studies of both elderly and non-elderly inpatients [11, 20] . With recent improvements in implants, it is important to focus on device-associated infections (DAIs [21] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 340, "end": 344, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 584, "end": 588, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 954, "end": 957, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2078, "end": 2082, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2083, "end": 2086, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2190, "end": 2194, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "For elderly inpatients with lower respiratory tract, urinary system, and bloodstream infections, the percentages of VAP, CAUTI, and CLABSI were 7.1% (57/802), 61.4% (170/277), and 33.3% (90/270), respectively. Ventilator and central line use rates in the elderly group were significantly higher than in the non-elderly, but the elderly had a lower urinary catheter use rate. The incidence density of VAP in elderly was lower than in non-elderly, but CAUTIs were significantly higher, and CLABSI rates were similar. These results suggest that the incidence densities of VAP, CLABSI, and CAUTI in elderly inpatients did not increase with the ventilator, central line, and urinary catheter use rates. The lower incidence density of VAP in the elderly group was probably because the admitting diagnosis often included lower respiratory tract infections, and it was difficult to find evidence of VAP in these patients. The high incidence density of CAUTI in elderly inpatients is consistent with other reports. A study concerned with risk factors for CAUTI in Italian elderly found that increasing age and duration of hospital stay before catheter insertion were associated with CAUTIs [22] . The high percentage of CAUTI may be related to specific issues of elderly inpatients, but also due to failures in catheter insertion as we observed here and which may be our next study. The low similar incidence density of CLABSI in both the elderly and non-elderly groups may be related to effective interventions to prevent CLABSI. Hallam and colleagues collected data over a 5-year period and found a significant and sustained reduction in the CLABSI rate from 5 per 1000 catheter days to 0.23 per 1000 catheter days [23] . The other notable finding of the current investigation was the pathogens detected in elderly HAI patients. The five most common were Candida albicans, Klebsiella pneumonia, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but they varied by infection site. Extensive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in elderly could account for the high positive detection rate of Candida albicans. The main pathogens of lower respiratory tract, urinary system, and bloodstream infections detected in elderly HAI patients could serve as reference evidence for empirical use of antibiotics to treat HAIs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1181, "end": 1185, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1708, "end": 1712, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "First, this was a single-center study, so our findings cannot be generalized to all elderly patients in China.
