However, these systemic infections are presumed to be a \"dead-end\" for P. aeruginosa and to have no impact on transmission. Here, we use a mouse infection model to show that P. aeruginosa can spread from the bloodstream to the gallbladder, where it replicates to extremely high numbers. Bacteria in the gallbladder can then seed the intestines and feces, leading to transmission to uninfected cage-mate mice. Our work shows that the gallbladder is crucial for spread of P. aeruginosa from the bloodstream to the feces during bacteremia, a process that promotes transmission in this experimental system. Further research is needed to test to what extent these findings are relevant to infections in patients.",

While progress has been made in minimizing patient-to-patient spread of HAI bacteria, much remains unknown regarding how these pathogens are transmitted between patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is a common cause of HAIs, and in a head-to-head comparison of bloodstream infections (bacteremias), PA was associated with higher mortality than other bacteria 2 . The reasons for this are poorly understood and this, coupled with the rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant PA, make prevention of PA transmission critical 3, 4 . However, such prevention has been hampered by an incomplete understanding of in-host PA infection dynamics and their relationship to transmission among hospitalized patients.",

Once bacteria reach the bloodstream, they are either cleared by the host with the help of antibiotics or die with the host if the infection is fatal. In either case, genetic adaptations in PA that confer an enhanced ability to disseminate to the bloodstream are subsequently eliminated from the gene pool. In this regard, PA is thought to differ from gastrointestinal (GI) pathogens, such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi [5] [6] [7] and Listeria monocytogenes [8] [9] [10] , which have evolved complex lifecycles that include trafficking from the blood to the gallbladder (GB) and subsequently to the intestines, from which they are excreted in feces to facilitate transmission to new hosts. In contrast, PA bloodstream infections would appear to be accidents from which the bacteria gain no benefit. Thus, the fitness pressures responsible for the evolution of virulence factors that facilitate dissemination of PA to the bloodstream are poorly understood.",

STAMP utilizes barcoded wild-type strains in combination with deep sequencing to track populations of bacteria, assess infection bottlenecks, and allow for assessment of relatedness of pathogen populations at different sampling sites. We demonstrated that bloodstream PA bacteria seeded the liver and subsequently the GB, where they unexpectedly replicated to extremely high numbers. The bacterial population from the GB seeded the intestines and was excreted in the feces in a manner that facilitated transmission to cage-mate mice. Mice lacking a GB (cholecystectomized) excreted dramatically fewer PA bacteria in their intestinal tracks than wildtype mice, highlighting a critical role for this organ in excretion and environmental contamination. The liver-GB-intestinal excretion pathway may therefore facilitate spread of PA from the bloodstream to the intestines and simultaneously allow amplification of PA. In this way, PA from systemic infections are returned to the environment in high numbers in order to enhance transmission between mice.",

At 4 hpi, PA was detected in the liver, lungs, and a minor proportion of GBs, but no bacteria were detected in the intestinal tract (Fig. 1j ). This was followed by a drastic six-logarithm expansion of bacteria in the GB by 14 hpi and similar four-to six-logarithm expansion in the intestinal tract (Fig. 1k) . In contrast, total bacterial counts in the lung and liver rose by only one-to twologarithms over the same period, demonstrating that high levels of PA replication was not a universal phenomenon. Bacterial recovery in the GB reached higher numbers than were originally in the inoculum, suggesting that the GB may be a hospitable niche for PA replication. In support of this, we also observed that PA growth in ex vivo bile preparations approached that of enriched medium (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). By 24 hpi, this dramatic expansion of bacteria had plateaued with only slight additional increases in all organs (Fig. 1l ). Lumenal contents of the intestinal tract contained similar bacterial CFU as observed in whole intestine homogenates (Supplementary Fig. 2g ; compare to Fig. 1l ), indicating that most of the PA bacteria were in the lumen rather than in the bowel wall. These findings indicate that bacteremia is followed by a dramatic expansion of the bacterial population in the GB and intestines, which is accompanied by PA excretion in the feces.",

The above data indicated that significant PA replication occurs in the GB, but questions remained as to how systemic PA gained access to the GB and if any population bottlenecks existed during this process. To investigate these questions, we utilized a technique to genetically track bacterial populations referred to as STAMP 11 . We first generated a library of barcoded but otherwise isogenic PABL012 (PABL012 pool ) containing~4000 unique short (~30 bp) sequence tags inserted into a neutral site on the chromosome. Our goal was to use this library to mathematically estimate the founding population size (N b ) at a given sampling site by measuring barcode frequencies from bacterial populations at that site. The N b value estimates population diversity and reflects how host barriers may shape bacterial populations during systemic infection. Next, we performed in vitro experiments to optimize STAMP. Control experiments demonstrated that barcodes did not influence growth rate ( Supplementary Fig. 4a ) and were stable in the absence of antibiotic selection ( Supplementary Fig. 4b ).",

            "text": "To accomplish this, we artificially simulated in vitro bottlenecks by sampling serial tenfold dilutions of the PABL012 pool and measured the N b of these samples using both bacterial enumeration and STAMP ( Supplementary Fig. 4c ). The calculated founding population size underestimated the actual founding population size in vitro, so a calibration curve was generated to aeruginosa disseminates to the gallbladder and intestines following bacteremia and pneumonia. Mice (n = 3, representative replicate) were intravenously injected with~2 \u00d7 10 6 CFU of a luciferase expressing strain of P. aeruginosa, PABL012 lux . Ventral (a) and dorsal (b) views of live mice at 24 hour post infection (hpi) were obtained using IVIS. Mice were subsequently euthanized, the abdominal wall dissected away and internal organs visualized (c). The heart and lung (d), spleen (e), liver (f), gallbladder (g), stomach (h), and remaining intestinal tract (i) of a single mouse were separately removed and imaged to visualize bacterial localization. (Since bioluminescence is dependent on oxygen, the signal present in the anaerobic portions of the intestinal tract may underestimate bacterial numbers.) The scale (red = high, blue = low) for all images represents radiance (photons per sec per cm 2 per steradian) with minimum and maximum values normalized to 1 \u00d7 10 4 and 1 \u00d7 10 5 , respectively. Intravenously infected mice housed on standard bedding were euthanized at 4 hpi (j, n = 5), 14 hpi (k, n = 5), or 24 hpi (l, n = 3 \u00d7 3 replicates). Bacteria were enumerated from several anatomical sites by plating serial dilutions of organ homogenates. m BALB/c mice (n = 3, representative replicate) were infected with PABL012 lux by intranasal inoculation of~2 \u00d7 10 6 CFU and imaged at 24 hpi using IVIS. n Mice (n = 4 \u00d7 2 replicates) were subsequently euthanized and bacteria were enumerated from several anatomical sites. 11 . We applied the optimized STAMP approach to mice with PA bacteremia. Mice (n = 10) were injected with PABL012 pool ; perorgan total CFU counts recovered were consistent with those observed in prior experiments (Fig. 2a , c compared to Fig. 1k, l) . that PA experiences a severe bottleneck in moving from the bloodstream to these organs. This low diversity (N b \u02b9) coupled with a high bacterial density (CFU), suggests that the few PA cells that traverse this narrow bottleneck are able to replicate to high levels upon arrival in the GB. Interestingly, the founding population sizes for PA isolated from the liver, GB, intestines and feces were all quite similar, suggesting that these bacterial populations may be related to one another. We hypothesized that the liver may be imposing the tight bottleneck observed in our N b \u02b9 calculations. Because of the anatomic link between the liver, GB, and intestines, PA bacteria may migrate from the liver to the GB, where they undergo unimpeded replication and subsequent escape from the host via the intestinal tract. To address this hypothesis, specific barcode frequencies (allelic frequencies) of the bacterial populations from pairs of organs taken from individual mice were compared to determine their genetic relatedness (GR) according to the method of Cavalli and Sforza 12 (Fig. 2b, d) . The PA populations within the GB, small intestine, cecum, colon, and feces of each mouse increased in relatedness from 14 hpi (Fig. 2b ) to virtually identical populations by 24 hpi (GR values approaching 1, Fig. 2d ). In silico simulations revealed that the high levels of GR observed in our animal experiments were not secondary to chance or influenced by the skewed distribution of barcodes in PABL012 pool (Supplemental Figs. 5b, 6b), but suggested that the populations were linked to each other ( Supplementary Fig. 7 , see Methods section for details). Moreover, at both 14 and 24 hpi, these populations were dominated by the same relatively few sequence barcodes (Fig. 2e , f, Supplementary Figs. 5a and 6a), indicating that a relatively small number of bacteria founded this population and subsequently replicated to high levels. These dominant sequence tags were consistently the dominant sequence tags from the liver (Supplementary Figs. 5a and 6a), suggesting that the population in the GB arose from a subpopulation of cells that migrated from the liver. Taken together, these data suggest that during bacteremia a small subpopulation of PA replicated in the liver and seeded the GB. Once in the GB this population then expanded dramatically, disseminated to the intestines and was excreted in the feces. The lack of high levels of GR between the populations in the lung, spleen and liver suggests that these organs were seeded independently by unique founding populations and that the dynamics of population control within each organ were different (Fig. 2b, d) .",

Mice were infected with a sublethal infectious dose (~8 \u00d7 10 5 CFU) of PABL012 lux . By 2 days post infection, the feces of 100% of infected mice contained between 10 4 and 10 8 CFU per gram of feces of PABL012 lux , and excretion was sustained over 5 days (Fig. 3a) . Beginning at day 6 and continuing through the remainder of the experiment, the number of infected mice shedding this concentration of PABL012 lux dramatically declined until all infected mice cleared PA from their stools by day 10 (Fig. 3a) . The levels of PA in the feces of infected mice were not influenced by the coprophagic behavior of mice, as infected mice housed on raised wire floors (whereby fecal pellets are inaccessible for ingestion) showed no difference in the fecal bacterial load at 24 hpi compared to infected mice housed on normal bedding (Fig. 3c) . To further verify that the observed fecal shedding of bacteremic mice was not a consequence of coprophagia, we tested whether orogastrically delivered PA contributed to the PA load in the feces of bacteremic mice. A PA strain marked with a chromosomal gentamicin resistance cassette (PABL012 GM ) was administered by oral gavage to mice systemically infected either 4 or 10 h prior with PABL012 lux (Fig. 3d ). The orally administered strain could only be detected in the feces of two mice when administered 10 h after initial injection of PABL012 lux (Fig. 3d) . Furthermore, this recovered population of PABL012 GM was 1000 times smaller than the fecal population of systemically delivered bacteria (PABL012 lux ) and had a minimal contribution to the overall bacterial counts in the feces. Together, these experiments indicate that bacteremic mice shed substantial amounts of PA into their environment regardless of mouse coprophagic behaviors.",

Although no uninfected mice displayed any outward signs of PA infection, approximately 60% of the uninfected mice began to excrete PABL012 lux (10 3 -10 4 CFU per gram feces) by day 4, with peak fecal excretion by uninfected mice on day 6 ( Fig. 3b ). This was followed by a steady decline in bacterial counts in the feces over the remaining 4 days.

This observation was somewhat surprising, given our previous results demonstrating the negligible impact of coprophagia on PA in the feces (Fig. 3c, d) . Likewise, previous work in mouse models demonstrated that PA cannot access the GI tract through orogastric routes unless extremely high doses of bacteria (>10 7 CFU per mL drinking water) were administered to antibiotic treated animals depleted of GI microbiota [13] [14] [15] . To further explore this phenomenon, Fig. 2 Diversity and relatedness P. aeruginosa populations following bloodstream infection. BALB/c mice were intravenously injected with~2 \u00d7 10 6 CFU of PABL012 pool . a Bacterial loads (total CFU per organ, black circles) and N b \u2032 sizes (red squares) in different tissues were determined at 14 (a) and 24 hpi (c). CFU values are expressed per organ for the lung, spleen, liver, gallbladder (GB), stomach (Stom.), small intestine (Sm. Int.), cecum, colon, and feces. Each black circle and red square represent an organ from one mouse (14 hpi n = 9, 24 hpi n = 10). Geometric means (horizontal lines) are shown.

To test whether the material and microbes present in feces were necessary to facilitate PA carriage, we homogenized PABL012 lux -contaminated fecal pellets into a slurry and orally inoculated the slurry (2 \u00d7 10 5 CFU, maximum obtainable dose from pellets of \u224825 shedding mice) into mice. No bacteria could be detected in the feces of these mice at 24-hours post-gavage (Fig. 3h) , indicating that the presence of contaminated fecal material is not sufficient to allow orally administered PA to result in carriage. We, therefore, hypothesized that the nature of the intact fecal pellet in some way facilitates this process. For example, the deeper portions of the pellet may enhance the survival of anaerobic bacteria that promote PA carriage in the GI tract or the pellet architecture might enable PA survival during passage through the acidic environment of the stomach. To address this, we collected all fecal pellets excreted daily from mice infected intravenously with PABL012 lux and transferred only the contaminated fecal pellets to the cages of uninfected mice simultaneously with daily cage and water changes. Although the numbers of fecal PA ingested by the uninfected mice could not be determined, it was estimated to be significantly less than the orogastric doses used in the preceding experiments. One uninfected mouse began to excrete PABL012 lux by day 4 and additional mice by day 6 (10 3 -10 4 CFU per gram feces, Fig. 3e, f) . These findings confirm that exposure to PA contained within fecal pellets is sufficient to facilitate transmission to uninfected The gallbladder promotes prolonged intestinal shedding of P. aeruginosa following bacteremia.

GBs from mock-infected animals, having no visible bacteria in the lumen, had a typical mucosal layer consisting of columnar epithelial cells with basal nuclei, extended microvilli, and an intact lamina propria (Fig. 4a,  b) . In contrast, the mucosa of GBs from infected mice displayed a general distortion of the cellular architecture characterized by large nuclei, widened tight junctions, increased vacuoles, and disrupted lamina propria (Fig. 4a, b) . Disrupted microvillus architecture, characterized by blunted, disordered, or absent microvilli, was observed at the epithelial surface, especially in areas of close association with PA (Fig. 4b) . In mice infected with PABL012 lux , we also noted intermittent focal bacterial aggregates at the epithelial surface overlying damaged columnar epithelial cells (Fig. 4a, Pa) . Neutrophils were observed at both the basolateral surface (arrows) of the epithelial layer and extravasating through it toward visible lumenal bacteria (arrowhead) (Fig. 4c) . The type III secretion system (T3SS) is a major driver of virulence in PA and is known to damage epithelial surfaces 16, 17 through direct injection of cytotoxic effector proteins. To assess the role of the T3SS in expansion within the GB and intestines, mice were infected with a T3SS mutant (PABL012\u0394pscJ lux ) and monitored for disease progression. The T3SS mutant was absent from the liver, GB, and feces when infected at the standard wildtype dose (Fig. 5a, b) . In addition, the PABL012\u0394pscJ lux mutant phenotype could not be rescued by coinfection with wild-type PABL012 lux (Fig. 5c) , suggesting that any in vivo bottlenecks act directly on the bacteria. The attenuation of the T3SS mutant could be overcome by increasing the infectious dose 100-fold (Fig. 5a, b) . However, in contrast to the mucosal damage observed with wild-type infection, no damage to the GB epithelium was observed at this higher dose (Fig. 5d) . Thus, an intact T3SS is important for PA dissemination to the GB and subsequent fecal shedding, and results in damage to the GB epithelium.",

To determine whether GB expansion and fecal excretion were observed following PA pneumonia, 6-to 8-week-old BALB/c mice were infected by intranasal inoculation with PABL012 lux (standard dose, 2 \u00d7 10 6 CFU) and monitored for 24 hpi. Infected mice displayed a largely disseminated pattern of infection (Fig. 1m) and contained high numbers of bacteria in the liver, GB, and feces (Fig. 1n) .

For example, PA bloodstream infections are associated with mortality rates between 25 and 50% 2,20,21 . By applying in vivo imaging of bioluminescent bacteria and STAMP analysis to a mouse model of bacteremia, we have identified an unexpected pathway through which PA experiences a narrow bottleneck as it traffics from the bloodstream to the GB and ultimately the intestines. The GB serves as protected expansion niche for PA that facilitates excretion into the environment (Fig. 6) . In epidemiologic studies in humans and mice, the GB has been shown to be an important replication niche for a variety of enteric pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes (Lm), Escherichia coli, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi 7,22,23 , and replication in the GB has been shown to fuel transmission through GI excretion. STAMP was previously applied to Lm bloodstream infection revealing that Lm experiences a similarly narrow bottleneck in the GB and intestines 9 and identifying the GB as the main driver of fecal excretion. Here, we show that a similar phenomenon occurs with the nonenteric and healthcare-associated pathogen PA. PA migrates through a narrow bottleneck to reach the GB, and removal of this organ dramatically reduces the levels of PA excreted into the environment. Thus, GB expansion of a small population of bacteria following bloodstream infection is a strategy more universally employed by bacteria than previously appreciated.",

The mechanisms of bile resistance in PA are unknown; however, a role for multidrug efflux pumps such as MexAB-OprM has been suggested 25, 26 . Thus, bile exposure may promote antibiotic resistance by inducing expression of efflux pumps, and transit through the GB may enhance excretion of drug-resistant PA. Hardy and colleagues suggested that Lm uses the lumen of the GB to escape immune surveillance 22 , and it is possible that the immune privileged nature of this organ provides an ideal environment for PA replication as well. PA plays an active role in promoting trafficking to and expansion in the GB as these do not occur in the absence of a functional T3SS. These findings suggest that, in addition to enhancing virulence, the PA T3SS functions to promote GI carriage and transmission.",

Once in the bloodstream, PA enacts a virulence strategy whereby it exploits the GB as a protected replication niche and facilitates its own exit back into the environment via high levels of intestinal excretion.

            "text": "Our results were obtained using a murine model, but it is intriguing to speculate whether they apply to humans. A number of observations indicate that PA can access the GBs of patients. PA is one of the five pathogens most commonly isolated from the bile of individuals with cholecystitis 27 and has been associated with secondary sclerosing cholangitis, a dreaded complication of critical illness that involves the biliary system of the liver 28 . Likewise, PA is a leading cause of acalculous cholecystitis (inflammation of the GB in the absence of gallstones), a common complication of serious medical illness 29 . In these contexts, it has been suggested that PA gains access to the biliary tree by ascending from the duodenum via the common bile duct. However, it is conceivable that some of these infections are secondary to occult or intermittent PA bacteremia and arrive in the GB via the liver. Likewise, the GI tract is recognized as an important reservoir for PA in hospitalized patients [30] [31] [32] , and it is appreciated that PA GI carriage is a precursor to both invasive infections 33, 34 and environmental contamination. Could this environmental contamination lead to transmission of PA between patients? Transmission of PA via the hands of health care workers [35] [36] [37] [38] or indirectly through contamination of environmental objects such as bedrails, sinks, drains, and endoscopes 39, 40 has been repeatedly documented and postulated to explain the geographic spread of global epidemic strains, such as sequence type (ST) 111, ST175, and ST235 41, 42 . With regard to transmission via fecal excretion, an obvious difference between mice and people is that the latter are not coprophagic. Yet, fecal-oral spread of other bacterial pathogens such as Clostridioides difficile and vancomycinresistant enterococci, is clearly common among patients in intensive care units and the cause of considerable infection control efforts. Ample opportunities may therefore exist for PA-contaminated fecal material to also spread from patient-topatient. However, whether such transferred material contains sufficient numbers of PA and whether it is in a form that facilitates transmission (Fig. 3) is unclear. Additional studies are necessary to examine the role of the GB and intestinal tract in transmission of PA among patients.",

Nair was used to remove abdominal hair, and the mouse was positioned on its dorsal surface under an operating microscope. A 1-in. skin incision was made in the abdominal skin followed by a similar incision in the peritoneum. The peritoneum was reflected and the sternum retracted. Bowels were covered in sterile gauze infused with warm saline. The ligament attaching the murine GB to the base of the diaphragm was severed with electrocautery. The GB was then tied off at the base with an absorbable 7-0 silk suture, excised in total with electrocautery. The abdominal cavity was irrigated with warm saline and the peritoneum closed with a 5-0 absorbable suture.

As described by Abel et al. 11 , the diversity of barcodes present in a subculture of tagged bacteria can be used to calculate the size of the founding population of that subculture. We compared the mathematically determined founding population sizes to those induced experimentally (N b ). Briefly, we diluted three frozen aliquots of the PABL012 pool library (A-C) (50 \u03bcL) 1:100 in MINS and grew with shaking overnight at 37\u00b0C. In the morning, cultures were diluted into fresh MINS medium and grown at 37\u00b0C for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (13,000\u00d7g, room temperature, 2 min) and resuspended in PBS. A small portion of each serial dilution of each replicate was used to enumerate total CFU, and the remainder was plated at 37\u00b0C overnight. Following growth, all bacterial colonies were scraped off using Falcon cell scrapers into 5 mL of PBS. Samples were concentrated by centrifugation at 8000\u00d7g for 10 min and resuspended in 1 mL of PBS. Genomic DNA was harvested from each sample using the Promega Maxwell 16 Instrument \u00ae and the Cell DNA Purification Kit. The tagged region that harbored the 30-bp barcode was amplified in triplicate from genomic DNA using primer P47 and primers P48, P51-73 (Supplementary Table 4 ). The PCR products were run on a 1.5% agarose gel, pooled, extracted from the gel using Qiagen QIAquick \u00ae gel extraction kit and quantified (Invitrogen Quant-iT \u2122 dsDNA Assay Kit, High Sensitivity). The purified PCR products were combined in equimolar concentrations and sequenced on an Illumina Miseq instrument (Miseq Reagent Kit v2, 50-cycle, Illumina) using custom sequencing primer P49 11 (Supplementary Table 4 ) with a mean cluster density of 8.6 \u00d7 10 5 \u00b1 2.5 \u00d7 10 5 . Reaper-15-065 was used to discard sequence reads with low quality (\u2264Q30) and to trim the sequence following the barcode 56 . The trimmed sequences were clustered with QIIME (version 1.9.1) using pick_otus.py with a sequence similarity threshold of 0.9 57,58 . The resulting estimated N b was mathematically calculated from the frequency of each barcode as described by Abel et al. 11 using the method of Krimbas and Tsakas 59 . These N b values were then compared to experimentally determined founding population sizes (CFU) to generate a calibration curve (Supplementary Fig. 4c ). As mathematically derived N b values underestimated the actual N b value based on the calibration curve, this curve was used to adjust N b values obtained from organs harvested from infected mice yielding corrected founding population sizes (N b \u2032). For each N b \u2032 value calculated for every organ in each mouse, 95% confidence intervals are presented (Supplementary Figs. 5d and 6d) .",

At 14 and 24 hpi, mice were euthanized and the lungs, liver, spleen, GB, stomach, small intestine, cecum, colon, and feces were harvested, weighed, homogenized in 1 mL of PBS, and plated for CFU counts. For N b \u2032 analysis, 500 \u00b5L of samples from the lung, spleen, liver, GB, stomach, small intestine, cecum, colon, feces, and 250 \u00b5L of inoculum \u00d7 30 were independently spread on 100 \u00d7 15 mm Petri dishes containing LB with 5 \u00b5g per mL irgasan. Plates were grown at 37\u00b0C overnight and bacteria sequenced for barcode diversity as above. N b values were calculated as described in the previous section and adjusted using the calibration curve with an R script 11 to estimate in vivo founding population sizes (N b \u2032). When the number of recovered CFUs was below 100, N b \u2032 determination was not performed. \"Genetic distance\" between the bacterial populations in two different organs was estimated by comparing the barcode allelic frequencies of the two populations using the Cavalli-Sforza chord distance method 12 as described by Abel et al. 11 . GR was calculated as (1 \u2212 genetic distance).",

            "text": "Simulated bottlenecks and their impact on GR. The Cavalli-Sforza chord distance method of determining GR is sensitive to narrow population bottlenecks especially when the input population has a disproportionate skew in barcode frequencies (as in PABL012 pool, Supplementary Figs. 5b and 6b ). Thus, it is possible that the experimental PA populations in the liver, GB and intestinal tract appear to be linked because of their high GR, but actually originated as separate, independent events that stochastically share the same dominant barcodes from the inoculum. To address whether the input barcode distribution from our experimental inoculum (PABL012 pool ) could produce high-GR populations after independently experiencing the narrowest experimental bottleneck observed in our study (M1-10 GB), we performed in silico bottleneck simulations and compared the GR of those simulated populations. First, to model the input population skew, we distributed reads (totaling the average inoculum read count, n = 652,410) to create a simulated inoculum population (INOC_Sim) according to the average frequency of each barcode present in PABL012 pool (average of INOC 1-30). Next, we determined the median number of unique barcodes present in our experimental bottleneck (M1-10 GB, n = 475). We then randomly chose 475 barcodes from our INOC_Sim population where the odds of choosing any one barcode were proportional to its relative frequency in INOC_Sim. Unique read counts (n = 644,750 total) as determined by the average barcode frequency distribution in the GBs were assigned to each selected barcode (e.g., the highest read count was assigned to the first selected barcode and the second highest read count was assigned to the second selected barcode, etc.). Barcodes were only assigned a read count value once and all unselected barcodes were given a read count of zero. In this fashion, 500 unique simulated populations were generated, each having experienced the same bottleneck. The N b \u2032 values (n = 500) for each simulated population were determined to ensure a similar distribution of founding population sizes as observed experimentally. GR values were then calculated for each pairwise comparison of the 500 simulated populations (n = 124,750 comparisons, Supplementary Fig. 7b-e) as described above. Simulated N b \u2032 values ranged from 1 to 209 and GR values ranged from 0.13 to 0.34 (Moderately Low). Simulations never produced the high-GR values we observed in our animal experiments (Supplementary Fig. 7) .",

Given that the 30 inoculum samples were from the same original stock of PABL012 pool and therefore technically identical with the maximum possible experimentally determined GR, we averaged the GR between inoculum samples (\u22122 standard deviations) at 14 and 24 hpi to set the threshold for \"High\" levels of GR at \u22650.88. Given that barcode loss is stochastic and that the dominant barcodes found in individual organs are unique to each mouse, we determined inter-mouse (between mice) GR between organs at 14 and 24 hpi (Supplementary Fig. 4d ). We defined \"Moderately High\" GR by averaging both the inter-mouse (between mice) and intramouse (within a single mouse) GR values which yielded a value of 0.41 (Mod. High, values \u22650.41 and \u22640.88). The populations of PA in organs between mice (inter-mouse) were the least likely to be related (the lowest GR values) so we averaged these least-related organs (intermouse LG, LV, ST, GB, IN, CM, CO, FE at 14 and 24 hpi) to define the \"Low\" GR threshold as \u22640.17. The inter-mouse spleen GR values were specifically excluded from this calculation because they displayed Moderately High (14 hpi) and Moderately Mow (24 hpi) GR, respectively, likely secondary to the presence of large numbers of diverse barcodes in this organ ( Supplementary Fig. 4d ).",
