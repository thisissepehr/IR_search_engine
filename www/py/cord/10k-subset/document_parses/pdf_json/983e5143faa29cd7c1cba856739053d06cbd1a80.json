            "text": "In past decades, interdisciplinary research has been of great interest for scholars. Thiazolidine motifs behave as a bridge between organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry and compel researchers to explore new drug candidates. Thiazolidine motifs are very intriguing heterocyclic five-membered moieties present in diverse natural and bioactive compounds having sulfur at the first position and nitrogen at the third position. The presence of sulfur enhances their pharmacological properties, and, therefore, they are used as vehicles in the synthesis of valuable organic combinations. They show varied biological properties viz. anticancer, anticonvulsant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, antioxidant activity and so on. This diversity in the biological response makes it a highly prized moiety. Based on literature studies, various synthetic approaches like multicomponent reaction, click reaction, nano-catalysis and green chemistry have been employed to improve their selectivity, purity, product yield and pharmacokinetic activity. In this review article, we have summarized systematic approaches for the synthesis of thiazolidine and its derivatives, along with their pharmacological activity, including advantages of green synthesis, atom economy, cleaner reaction profile and catalyst recovery which will help scientists to probe and stimulate the study of these scaffolds.",

            "text": "Heterocyclic composites are an important class of organic compounds possessing broad applications in various fields of science [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . One of the most eminent heterocyclic motifs, thiazolidine, is a five-membered heterocycle system having the formula C 3 H 7 NS containing one nitrogen and one sulfur atom, and which exhibits notable medicinal and pharmaceutical properties. In the thiazolidine nucleus, a large number of substitutions are possible on 2, 4 and 5 positions responsible for enhancing the compound's pharmaceutical importance. Thiazolidine and its composites are key components of many natural products and drugs (Fig. 1) , and are also present in many synthetic compounds such as anticancer [8] [9] [10] [11] , antimicrobial [12] [13] [14] , antitumor [15, 16] , antidiabetic [17] , antiparasitic [18, 19] , anti-inflammatory [20] [21] [22] , antitubercular [23] , antifungal [24] , antiviral [25, 26] , anti-HIV [27] [28] [29] , cytotoxicity [30] , antitrypanosomal [31] , antinociceptive and anti-hypernociceptive compounds [32] . In addition, the use of thiazolidines as an inhibitor of tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase I [33] and influenza neuraminidase [34] , pro-drugs for the treatment of cystinosis [35] , radioprotective against \u03b3-irradiation [36] and as S1P1 receptor agonists [37, 38] has also been reported. They are also used in peptide and protein modification [39] , protein chemical synthesis [40] , as activators to innate immunity [41] and also act as immunostimulating agents [42] . These derivatives are also involved in various syntheses as synthetic precursors, potential biomarkers for oxidative stress and formaldehyde exposure [43] , heterogeneous catalysts [44, 45] , free radicals, superoxide anion radical and hydroxyl radical scavengers [46] [47] [48] , inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitors [49] , to construct non-fullerene small molecules [50] and on and on. Green chemistry was formulated in the 1990s and includes 12 principles. The green processes diminish the adverse effects of any chemical reaction by following certain criteria viz. catalystand solvent-free synthesis and designing of biodegradable and less toxic products with high efficiency. In this review article, we have compiled researches which step ahead toward green chemistry. In the past few years, divergent synthetic strategies [51] have been introduced aimed at efficient and green synthesis using inexpensive reactants, nontoxic solvents, reusable catalysts, nanoparticle-catalyzed synthesis and solvent-free synthesis with high yields using different techniques such as microwave irradiation (MWI), sonochemistry, surface chemistry and others (Fig. 2) . Multicomponent reactions (MCRs) (Strecker, Ugi, Bucherer-Bergs, Biginelli) are excellent pathways for the synthesis of heterocycles [52] as they have all the features for ideal synthesis like simple procedure for generating complex hybrid molecules in fewer steps which possess excellent pharmaceutical activity with high atom economy and eco-friendliness [53, 54] . The notable features of thiazolidine scaffolds compel us to study the literature and outline the current status of thiazolidine, its derivatives and also their biological significance. Recently, Jain et al. [55] reviewed the biological activity of thiazolidinone derivatives from 2000 to 2011. In 2013, Jain and coauthors [56] reviewed the multifarious applications of various thiazolidine-2,4-dione derivatives. Nanjan et al. [57] reviewed the antidiabetic activity of thiazolidinone. But there is no detailed review of the synthesis and biological activity of Comparative study of various synthetic protocols [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] Fig. 5 Comparative study of various synthetic protocols [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] hoping to inspire new and even more creative approaches for researchers (Fig. 3) .",

Recently, magnetic nanoparticles have received great attention because of their enormous benefits such as cost-efficiency, good stability, easy separation and high surface area [72] . Coating of nanoparticles with various materials like copper [73] , chitosan [74] and l-proline [75] improves their activity [76] . Safaei-Ghomi and his group [77] developed a novel, efficient, pseudo-five-component preparation of bis-thiazolidinones 31(a-j) from substituted benzaldehyde, ethylenediamine and TGA (3) with nano-CdZr 4 (PO 4 ) 6 as a retrievable and robust catalyst (Scheme 15). The 0.6 mol% catalyst loading was sufficient for the good yield of products. It was observed that the best results were obtained with aromatic aldehydes with electron-withdrawing groups (EWG) as compared to electron-donating groups (EDG). The catalyst CdZr 4 (PO 4 ) 6 provided the surface to carry out the reaction. Primarily imine formed as an intermediate by the reaction of benzaldehyde and ethylene diamine on the surface of the catalyst, which activated the C=O, C=N and S-H groups. Then, attack by the sulfur atom on the activated imine group occurred, followed by intramolecular cyclization to give thiazolidinones (Scheme 16).",

These are used as an ecofriendly and reusable solvents or catalysts due to many characteristics like lower melting point as compared to individual components because of delocalization of charge on the whole mixture, high viscosity and inadequate density, so they can be liquid at the broad range of atmospheric conditions and incombustible. The mechanism of the reaction showed that DES firstly interacted with the oxygen of the carbonyl compound, and, simultaneously, the nitrogen atom of aniline attacked the carbon atom; then, imine was formed as an intermediate, which further reacted with TGA to form the product. At last, DES was removed and reused at least five times continuously without any damage. ",

An ecologically benign process containing inactive aziridine and aroyl isothiocyanates under the solventfree conditions at room temperature produced 2-iminothiazolidines. Here, aroyl isothiocyanates played a role either as an ambient nucleophile (-SCN or -NCS) or electrophile. When this reaction was accomplished with solvent, the yield was comparatively low. This process was examined with substituted aziridine and aroyl isothiocyanates, and the authors demonstrated that the synthesis was facile when aziridine bearing electron-donating groups and aroyl isothiocyanates having electron-withdrawing substituents were taken. The mechanism of the reaction showed that this methodology involved [3+2] cycloaddition reaction which occurred by the S N 2 pathway. This was confirmed by the reaction of optically active aziridine and aryl isothiocyanate, and it gave optically active product. The lone pair on the nitrogen of aziridine made it a nucleophile, and its attack on the sp hybrid carbon of heterocumulene NCS formed a thiourea intermediate, whose sulfur atom attacked the benzylic site of aziridine, and ring opening occurred (Scheme 31).",

Mahmoodi et al. [87] reported an appropriate, one-pot, threecomponent reaction for the preparation of thiazolidinones using KSF@Ni as a heterogeneous catalyst by the reaction of aldehydes, thiosemicarbazide and maleic anhydride under MWI (Scheme 32). Microwave MCRs have several advantages such as shorter reaction time, high product yields, cleaner reaction profile, minimal byproducts, and greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Heterogeneous catalyst has special features such as a long life span, easy removal and recovery, an innoxious nature, and is safe for storage. When the reaction was performed in the polar solvent, e.g. EtOH, DMF and MeOH, the reaction proceeded slowly. This method worked successfully under MWI at 70 \u00b0C and 50 psi in the mixture of DMF:toluene (1:1) in short reaction time (5 min) to give high yield (60%). The catalyst was recyclable for seven runs and gave almost the same yield of products. These products showed in vitro antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and M. luteus. Sangeetha and coworkers [88] disclosed microwave-assisted, solvent-free synthesis of thiazolidine derivatives (42) using Amberlite IR-120H resin as a greener and reusable catalyst. 3/5-Alkyl-2,6-diarylpiperidin-4-ones were condensed with thiosemicarbazide and ethyl-2-bromopropionate under 250 W MWI, which afforded high yield of 2,6-diarylpiperidin-4-ylidene thiazolidin-4-one derivatives within 3-6 min. In contrast, in the conventional method, it took more time and gave comparatively low yields (Scheme 33). All the synthesized compounds were evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity against five different bacterial strains S. aureus, S. pyogenes, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and E. coli and antitubercular activity against M. tuberculosis H37Rv, using streptomycin and isoniazid (INH) as standard drugs, respectively. Among all compounds, most displayed good antibacterial potency, and 42c and 42d showed high antitubercular activity. ",

The structure of compounds 72a and 72b were determined with X-ray single-crystal diffraction, Hirshfeld surface analysis and DFT studies at the B3LYP/6-311G (d,p) level of theory. The 3D structures of both compounds were different, due to presence of diverse substituents at the phenyl ring and co-crystallization with solvent molecules. Compound 72a docked with hydrophobic-hydrophobic interaction, but compound 72b docked with both hydrophobic-hydrophobic and H-bonding interactions. Aminoglycoside phosphotransferase and lanosterol 14 \u03b1-demethylase were selected as target proteins for antibacterial and antifungal activity, respectively.

The synthesis was carried out by both conventional and microwave heating. The compounds were further screened for antimicrobial activity (Scheme 64), and microwave-assisted synthesis afforded a high yield of the products. According to the mechanism, initially 2-amino-5-chlorophenol and benzaldehyde reacted to give imine intermediate. The imine reacted with mercaptoacetic acid and underwent intramolecular cyclization to form thiazolidinones (Scheme 65). All compounds were studied for in vitro antimicrobial activity against two Gram-positive bacteria (B. subtilis and S. aureus), two Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli and S. typhimurium) and four fungal strains (C. albicans, A. flavus, A. niger and C. neoformans) using a serial macrodilution method. Ciprofloxacin and ampicillin were used as reference antibacterial drugs, and fluconazole and miconazole were used as reference antifungal drugs. Among all the tested derivatives, 82f, 82g, 82l and 82m exhibited broad-spectrum activity, i.e. growth inhibitor against reference drug excluding fungus A. niger. Compounds 82g and 82m were more potent than the reference antifungal drug. All compounds also showed cytotoxicity on two cell lines, HeLa and MCF-7, using sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. The SAR study revealed that structural variation and molecular strain affected the activity of the products. The activity of the compounds was controlled by substituents, i.e. an EDG on the phenyl ring enhanced the activity, whereas an EWG decreased activity. The remarkable features of this protocol were high yields with shorter reaction time, a unique, rapid and convenient synthesis, and all the compounds were non-cytotoxic.",

The 4-thiazolidinones 83(a-d) were synthesized from thiosemicarbazones and ethyl 2-bromopropionate by refluxing in acetonitrile in high yields.

The modification in subunit A was carried out by the reaction of substituted sulfonyl chlorides and 4-aminoacetophenone, and they formed intermediates which further reacted with phenyltrimethylammonium tribromide, pyridin-3-ylmethenamine and carbon disulfide (Scheme 74).

The SARs study using fluorescent PK-LDH coupled assay showed that the electronic and steric effect of substituents at the benzene ring affected activation activity of PKM2. Compounds 91t and 91y (AC50 value 0.52 \u00b5M, 0.74 \u00b5M respectively) showed higher potency than other derivatives (AC50 = 2.96 \u00b5M). The EWG (91h-91m), multi-substituents (91d and 91e) and large groups which showed steric hindrance (91n-91p) on the benzene ring deactivated PKM2, and when the ring was substituted with -CH 3 and -OCH 3 groups at the meta and para positions, the activity was decreased, whereas a methyl group at the ortho position at nanomolar concentration increased the activity.

Enterovirus, Yellow fever virus, Murine norovirus and Chikungunya virus strains were used for screening of antiviral potency. 4-Thiazolidinone derivatives were obtained in two different ways; firstly, cyclization of chloroacetamide with NH 4 SCN, and secondly, cyclization of thiourea and ethyl bromoacetate with sodium acetate. In this method, five tautomeric forms were obtained (Scheme 75). All synthesized compounds have EC50 value higher than 0.3 \u00b5M. The anticancer activity was evaluated against K562, MCF-7, A549, PC-3, HT-29, HeLa and SJSA1 cell lines at a dose of 10 \u00b5M. Compounds 92 and 93 showed significant inhibition effect, i.e. 32.29% inhibition in HT29 and 35.82% inhibition in HeLa cell lines, respectively. Compound 94 was identified as the most active substance (38.92% inhibition vs. HT-29 and 35.96% inhibition vs. SJSA1) and has a high survival rate of 92.01% from NIH3T3 cell lines (Table 5) . Bataille and coworkers [127] synthesized novel 4-thiazolidinone derivatives and evaluated their anticancer activity for cancer in blood and lymph tissue via inhibition of the PIM kinase family by differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF). The in vitro antiproliferative activity was evaluated in two cancer cell lines (MV4-11 and K562) against selected inhibitors. They used mainly two approaches; Firstly, they synthesized fused tricyclic series through hydrolysis followed by conjugate addition, which showed significant improvement in both solubility and metabolic stability. Another approach showed improvement in metabolic activity by addition of pseudothiohydantoin in place of the rhodanine head group. A compound of series 96 was formed by Knoevenagel condensation of carbonyl compounds and rhodanine using piperidine in EtOH (Scheme 76).

The compounds were divided into 11 classes on the basis of their structure. These series possessed better selectivity for pan-PIM kinases than other kinases. All tested compounds displayed good activity, and derivative 98b exhibited high activity against the K562 cell line, with an IC50 value of 0.75lM. Compound 97a has a phenyl group, and displayed a 90-fold increase in activity, with an IC50 value of 6.7 \u00b1 3.1 nM, and the in silico study revealed that their rhodanine head group showed H-bonding interaction with water which was connected with the Lys67 residue, and this interaction was found to be sandwich-like interaction between the products and the lipophilic area of the PIM binding pocket. The SAR study indicated that an electronic effect did not play a significant role in inhibition activity. Compound 98a containing a sulfonamide group showed excellent PIM1 inhibitor activity (IC50 25 \u00b1 4 nM) and also provided better kinetic solubility than other compounds.",

The pathway of the reaction is outlined in Scheme 77. All compounds have good growth inhibition against the tested cancer cell lines. Compounds 99j, 99p and 99r showed good antitumor effects with IC50 \u2264 15 \u03bcM against A549 cell lines and were safe to MCF10A ( Table 6 ). The contact of compound 99p with the A549 cell showed arrest of the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, inhibited in vitro cell migration (using wound-healing assay) via disruption of F-actin assembly and decreased F-actin extension, and apoptotic activity such as cell contraction, cell wall distortion and decreased viable cell numbers. For induction of apoptosis acridine orange-ethidium bromide (AO-EB), annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide staining, DAPI, MitoSOX and rhodamine-123 assays were used in A549 cells for compound 99p. According to SAR studies, the substitution on the head position gave high bioactive compounds as compared to tail substitution. Kumar and coworkers [129] developed a simple and direct synthesis of 4-thiazolidinone derivatives in the presence of propylphosphonic anhydride (T3P)-DMSO media as a cyclodehydrating agent and evaluated their cytotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo against leukemic cell lines (Reh and Nalm6). 4-Thiazolidine derivatives 100(a-j) were produced from primary and secondary alcohols and aryl amines using T3P-DMSO via one-pot synthesis at high yields (Scheme 78). The relative study displayed that the compounds exhibited better activity on Reh cell lines than Nalm6 cell lines. Among all tested compounds, 3-(4-bromophenyl)-2-(4-(dimethylamino) phenyl)thiazolidin-4-one (100e) showed potent activity against Reh cells and Nalm6 cells with IC50 values of 11.9 \u03bcM and 13.5 \u03bcM, respectively. The cell cycle analysis showed that 100e was able to aggregate cells in cell cycle subG1 phase, and also decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential and increased cell death in tested cell lines via apoptotic cell death.

The thiazolidine nucleus contains essential pharmacophoric elements like a benzene ring, a nitrogen atom, substitution at C-2 and N-3, lipophilic characters and a biophoric space of various heterocycles around the N-3 position, which is necessary for HIV inhibition. A series of allophenylnorstatine-based peptidomimetics with various P 1 , P 2 , P 3 and P 2 \u2032 moieties ( Fig. 9 ) was synthesized and screened as HIV-1 protease inhibitors by Hidaka et al. [139] . All compounds with P 2 tetrahydrofuranylglycine (Thfg) exhibited significant activity against wild-type HIV-1 protease and the virus against lopinavir/ritonavir-or darunavir-resistant strains. Among all derivatives, compound 116d (KNI-1657) displayed strong activity against the reference strain. Compound 116a including P 2 (2S, 3\u2032R)-Thfg showed 96% inhibition against HIV-1 protease at 1-nM concentration. Compound 116b showed 98% inhibition at 60 nM, and 116c in human serum displayed the most potent inhibition among the series. The derivatives with P3 modifications including chromonylcarbonyl, benzofurancarbonyl and 7-methoxybenzofurancarbonyl were found to be highly active against HIV protease, whereas selected P 2 \u2032 derivatives displayed inhibition activity in a 93-97% range at 1 nM.",

The treatment of 2-(chloromethyl) isoindoline-1,3-dione with diverse hydroxyl-substituted aromatic aldehydes using anhydrous K 2 CO 3 in dry acetone provided an adduct, which further underwent Knoevenagel condensation with rhodanine or thiazolidine-2,4-dione using \u03b2-alanine. It was previously observed that in the final compounds, a high yield of Z-stereoisomer was obtained (Scheme 87). Among all the synthesized derivatives, most compounds were potent inhibitors as compared to the reference drug. Compounds 117k, 118a, 118b, 118e, 118h and 118k have IC50 values of 20.95 \u00b1 0.21, 16.11 \u00b1 0.19, 7.72 \u00b1 0.16, 7.91 \u00b1 0.17, 6.59 \u00b1 0.15 and 5.44 \u00b1 0.13 \u03bcM, respectively, which represent their high inhibition activity .

It was also observed that EWGs chloro (117k, 118k) and nitro (117h, 118h) at the ortho-position of the phenyl ring increased inhibition against the reference drug than electron-donating substituents (-OCH 3 ). The binding interaction between the most active compounds and the active site of \u03b1-glucosidase was confirmed by molecular docking studies. In the binding place of \u03b1-glucosidase, compounds changed in \"L-shaped\" conformation, showed hydrogen bond interaction and displayed CH-\u03c0 interactions with the residue of Phe-157, Phe-177 and Phe-300.",

Other thiazolidine-2,4-dione derivatives were prepared through ring-opening reaction of (Z)-3-benzyl-5-(4-(oxiran-2-ylmethoxy)benzylidene)thiazolidine-2,4-dione with substituted benzylamines and picolylamines, respectively, in isopropanol under different conditions. Among all the synthesized compounds, 129 was the potent inhibitor of adipocyte differentiation, which stopped adipogenesis and lipidosis in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells by blocking of the S-phase of the cell cycle, prevented mitotic clonal development and decreased two vital transcription factors, PPARg and C/EBPa, and correlated genes like aP2 and FAS of adipocyte differentiation. The authors concluded that the final compounds effectively worked on obesity and related metabolic disorders (Fig. 10) .",

The concentration of inhibitor and temperature affected their efficiency of reaction: with increase in concentration, efficiency increased, but increased temperature decreased their efficiency. The weight loss measurement revealed that MBTMT (97.5%) showed higher efficiency than CBTMT (95.8%) at 303 K. This inhibition process was based mainly on adsorption, with both inhibitors obeying the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, and it was concluded that their inhibition depended on the covered surface area and number of active sites, i.e. N and S atoms.

            "text": "Green chemistry is a fascinating area in the field of sustainable synthesis. Green solvents and catalysts play a significant role in synthetic organic chemistry. Today's chemistry researchers need to explore new avenues of synthetic methodologies and biological applications of heterocyclic scaffolds. Though various developments have occurred in the synthetic and biological study of thiazolidine and its derivatives, there is a need for further development of the chemistry to enhance discoveries in this field. During the extensive review of the literature review on thiazolidine and its derivatives, several strengths and weaknesses were noted. For example, solvents used in the process of synthesis are hazardous to the environment, and therefore solvent-free synthesis has proven to be a boon for the environment and society, as it reduces waste and energy consumption. Solvents also serve as a heat transfer medium, and thus detailed study of their thermodynamics is required. A major drawback regarding the purification procedures (column chromatography) is that they require a large amount of solvents for purification, so extensive research is needed to avoid flaws. Ionic liquids are used as green solvents due to their recyclability, low volatility and so forth, but their high cost, safety issues and lack of generalization limit their use. In the recent scenario, crucial improvements in issues such as energy efficiency, by-product generation, impurity removal procedures, release of toxic products, whole life-cycle study and following common basic procedures with some modifications are necessary in the context of cost, population, environment, energy, health and resources. For industrial-level applications, synthesis methods could fulfill parameters including atom economy, environmental factor (e-factor), ecoscale, process profile, life-cycle analysis, environmental quotient and effective mass yield. Regarding pharmacological significance, thiazolidine-containing drugs show a variety of biological activity due to interactions such as hydrogen bonding, ion-dipole interaction, hydrophobic action, \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction, Van der Waal forces and bonding with various enzymes and pharmacophores.",

Therefore, critical study is needed with special emphasis on SAR and the role of PPARs in molecular mechanisms and biological activity. A better understanding of the structure of ligands and receptors and their interaction needs to be achieved. Keeping all these facts in view, thiazolidine motifs will prove to be valuable candidates for designing more effective and potent drugs by reducing their side effects. This review article includes a detailed study of thiazolidine and its derivatives, and their varied synthesis and pharmaceutical applications, and will pave a better pathway for future directions and challenges.",

The application of MW-, nanoparticle-and ionic liquid-mediated synthesis in such processes has opened a new avenue for thiazolidine formation. It is likely that in the future, many more powerful and benign methodologies will emerge in this field. Furthermore, attention should be paid to modification and substitution in thiazolidine nuclei and also toward SAR and docking studies for improving the design strategies for drug targets. On a global scale, the opportunity in the field of thiazolidine is broad for synthetic and medical discovery, and this knowledge has been applied in the synthesis of multi-target hybrid drugs, which control diseases such as diabetes, cancer, multiple sclerosis and lupus. We trust that this review will serve as an update for researchers focused on the synthesis of thiazolidine derivatives and will encourage further growth in this field.",

The possible reaction pathway of the reaction indicated that aldehyde along with amine produced an imine intermediate which combined with thioglycolic acid to form another intermediate. Silica gel activated the carbonyl group by increasing their electrophilicity, and, consequently, intramolecular addition took place, and a new intermediate was obtained. On further removal of H 2 O molecule, the cyclized product of substituted 4-thiazolidinone was obtained. The authors investigated this reaction in various solvents like THF, Et 2 O, acetonitrile, dichloromethane and 1,2-dichloroethene, but dichloromethane was found to be the most suitable. The products were obtained without any workup procedure.
