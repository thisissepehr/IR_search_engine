FP7 selectively blocked TLR4 stimulation, but not TLR1/2, TLR2/6, or TLR3 activation. TLR4 stimulation of human DCs resulted in increased glycolytic activity that was also antagonized by FP7. FP7 protected mice from influenza virus-induced lethality and reduced both proinflammatory cytokine gene expression in the lungs and acute lung injury (ALI). Therefore, FP7 can antagonize TLR4 activation in vitro and protect mice from severe influenza infection, most likely by reducing TLR4-dependent cytokine storm mediated by damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) like HMGB1.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Among the first receptors activated during host-pathogen interactions are members of the Toll-like Receptor (TLR) family, which can detect microbial products and induce innate and adaptive immune responses 1 . TLRs are pattern recognition receptors (PRR) that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Among them, TLR4 is the sensor of the Gram-negative bacteria endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). TLR4 is mainly expressed on monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), and macrophages (M\u03a6 s). LPS sensing and TLR4 activation are sequential processes, initiated by transfer of LPS monomers from aggregates in solution to LPS-binding protein (LBP), and subsequently to cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14, GPI-linked or soluble), and finally, to myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD-2) that associates with TLR4 noncovalently 2,3 . Appropriate ligand binding to MD-2 results in dimerization of two TLR4.MD-2 complexes, thus forming the activated heterodimer (LPS.MD-2. TLR4) 2 on the plasma membrane 4 . The involvement of the two co-receptors, CD14 and MD-2, in the process of ligand binding to MD-2 leading to receptor activation is unique to TLR4 and ensures a high degree sensitivity to endotoxin (detected at pM concentration). TLR4 is also the only TLR that activates both the MyD88-dependent pathway resulting in NF-\u03ba B and AP-1 activation and the MyD88-independent pathway involving the adaptors TRAM and TRIF, triggering IRF3 activation. The co-receptor CD14 has also been shown to be essential for initiating endocytosis of (TLR4.MD-2.LPS) 2 heterodimers and the subsequent activation of TRAM-TRIF pathway leading to the production of type I IFN 5 . Many other microbial ligands of TLR4 have been described such as the Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus envelope protein, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Fusion (F) protein, the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein, and Ebola virus GP 6-9 . TLR4 can be also activated by damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) derived from damaged, necrotic, or infected tissues. While different LPS types with inflammatory activities share a conserved lipid A moiety with chemical determinants that ensure optimal interaction with CD14 and MD-2 (5 or 6 lipophilic fatty acid chains attached to a disaccharide backbone, and one or two phosphate groups), DAMPs are chemically diverse and range from proteins (e.g., high-mobility group box 1, HMGB1) to oxidized phospholipids (oxPL) 10 . The molecular mechanism of TLR4 activation by DAMPs and the role of CD14 and MD-2 in the sensing of these molecules are not entirely understood; however, a more general role for CD14 and MD-2 as PAMP and DAMP co-receptors has begun to emerge 11 . DAMPs have been implicated in a large array of pathologies caused by TLR4 activation including atherosclerosis 12 , rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 13 , neuroinflammation, neuropathic pain 14 , and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 15 , ischemia/reperfusion, trauma 16 , and haemorrhage 17 .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "While TLR4 is the specific signalling receptor for bacterial LPS, recent data suggest a central role for TLR4 signalling in the pathology associated with viral infections.

In vitro, DCs can be differentiated from blood monocytes by incubation with GM-CSF and IL-4 for 6 days 44 . Both monocytes and monocyte-derived DCs express TLR4 and stimulation of TLR4 by LPS induces the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, although the nature of the cytokine response varies according to the cell type (Fig. 2) . TLR4 stimulation of DCs induces their phenotypic and functional maturation 19 . The inhibitory action of FP7 was thus tested on these primary cells. Cells were pre-treated with FP7 15 minutes prior to LPS stimulation for 24 h. FP7 almost completely blocked induction of IL-8, IL-6, and MIP-1\u03b2 , 3 of the major cytokines secreted by monocytes stimulated with LPS ( Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. S1a ). DCs stimulated by LPS showed a classic phenotype of human mature DC (mDC) with a strong induction of CD86 and CD40 expression and increased expression of HLA-DR, CD80, CD83 and CD54 (Fig. 2b) . LPS-stimulated DCs secrete high levels of IL-8, IL-6, MIP-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 , as well as IL-12 and IL-10 that are important indicators of their function ( Supplementary Fig. S1b ). FP7 abrogated the enhanced expression of all these phenotypic markers triggered by LPS. After DC differentiation, FP7 treatment also prevented LPS-induced secretion of IL-8, IL-6, MIP-1\u03b2 , TNF-\u03b1 , IL-12 p40, and IL-10 up to 100 ng/ml of LPS and inhibited cytokine secretion induced by 1000 ng/ml (Fig. 2c,d) . Thus, FP7 prevents LPS-induced maturation of DCs. Dose-dependent inhibition of TLR4 signalling by FP7. Previous results have shown that FP7 antagonized LPS signalling in HEK-Blue \u2122 -hTLR4 cells stably co-expressing TLR4, MD-2, and CD14 with an IC 50 of 0.46 \u03bc M for 10 ng/ml of LPS 40 . To evaluate the IC 50 of FP7 on primary cells, monocytes and DCs were pre-treated with increasing doses of FP7 for 15 minutes before stimulation with 10 ng/ml of LPS. IL-6, IL-8, and MIP-1\u03b2 secretion was then assayed in supernatants collected 24 h post-stimulation. The results indicate that FP7 inhibits the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines both in monocytes and DCs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3) . For monocytes, FP7 IC 50 was 0.06 \u03bc M for IL-6, 0.13 \u03bc M for IL-8, and 0.07 \u03bc M for MIP-1\u03b2 secretion. For DCs, FP7 IC 50 was 0.22 \u03bc M for IL-6, 0.44 \u03bc M for IL-8, and 0.32 \u03bc M for MIP-1\u03b2 secretion. These results correlate with the previous data obtained with HEK-Blue \u2122 -hTLR4 cells 40 . Monocyte and DC viability measurements showed that FP7 was not toxic at the maximal concentration of 10 \u03bc M ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). This concentration of FP7 was thus used in further experiments. FP7 selectively antagonizes TLR4 and has no effect on TLR1/2, TLR2/6, and TLR3 signalling. TLR4 and TLR2 receptors share the capacity to be activated by lipid ligands. The selectivity of FP7 for TLR4 had not been investigated previously 40 . TLR2 forms a heterodimer with TLR1 to bind triacylated lipopeptides 45 and with TLR6 to recognize diacylated lipopeptides 46 . HEK293 cells co-expressing human TLR4 with MD2 and CD14 (HEK293/hTLR4-MD2-CD14), or TLR1 and TLR2 (HEK293/hTLR1-TLR2), or TLR2 and TLR6 (HEK293/hTLR2-TLR6) were used to verify that ultrapure LPS could activate TLR4 only and not TLR1/2-or TLR2/6-expressing cells (Fig. 4a-c) . Endotoxin-free TLR1/2 ligand Pam 3 CSK 4 (Pam3), TLR2/6 ligand peptidoglycan (PGN), and TLR3 ligand double-stranded RNA poly(I:C) (pIC) failed to stimulate TLR4-expressing cells (data not shown). The effect of DC pre-treatment with 10 \u03bc M FP7 prior to activation by LPS, Pam3, PGN, and pIC was analysed. Secretion of IL-6, IL-8, and MIP-1\u03b2 was measured in the supernatants at 24 h post-stimulation. FP7 strongly antagonized the stimulation of DCs by TLR4 ligand, whereas it did not affect the stimulation by TLR1/2, TLR2/6, or TLR3 ligands (Fig. 4d) . FP7 antagonizes TLR4-induced metabolic reprogramming in DCs. Previous studies found that LPS stimulation of murine bone marrow-derived DCs induced a glycolytic burst required for DC maturation [27] [28] [29] . We investigated whether this metabolic regulation could be observed in monocyte-derived human DCs. Differentiated DCs were seeded in fresh medium prior to LPS stimulation for 24 h. Glucose consumption and lactate production were monitored to assess the input and output rates of glycolysis. We found that LPS stimulation increased both the glucose consumption and the lactate production by DCs, indicative of an enhanced glycolytic flux (Fig. 5a,b) . Treatment of cells with FP7 prior to LPS stimulation inhibited these metabolic changes induced by LPS up to 100 ng/ml. At the highest LPS concentration, FP7 could not completely block the increase of the glycolytic flux, consistent with cytokine secretion data (Fig. 2) . TLR4-specific blocking antibody also prevented the increase of glucose consumption induced by LPS (Fig. 5c) . These results indicate that TLR4 stimulation induced an increased glycolytic flux in monocyte-derived human DCs that can be inhibited by FP7.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 263, "end": 267, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 268, "end": 272, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 273, "end": 277, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 383, "end": 385, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 689, "end": 691, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1977, "end": 1979, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2677, "end": 2679, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2972, "end": 2976, "text": "TLR4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3118, "end": 3120, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 3191, "end": 3193, "text": "45", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 3245, "end": 3247, "text": "46", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 4271, "end": 4275, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 4276, "end": 4280, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 4281, "end": 4285, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 603, "end": 611, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 978, "end": 985, "text": "Fig. 2a", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 990, "end": 1012, "text": "Supplementary Fig. S1a", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}, {"start": 1198, "end": 1207, "text": "(Fig. 2b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1359, "end": 1381, "text": "Supplementary Fig. S1b", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}, {"start": 1681, "end": 1692, "text": "(Fig. 2c,d)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2383, "end": 2391, "text": "(Fig. 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 2792, "end": 2813, "text": "Supplementary Fig. S2", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 3512, "end": 3523, "text": "(Fig. 4a-c)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 4066, "end": 4075, "text": "(Fig. 4d)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 4725, "end": 4736, "text": "(Fig. 5a,b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 5000, "end": 5008, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 5109, "end": 5118, "text": "(Fig. 5c)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Inhibition of LPS-induced activation of human monocytes and maturation of DCs by FP7."}, {"text": "Metabolic reprogramming is necessary for DC maturation.

We found in this study that TLR4 stimulation of human monocyte-derived DCs increased both glucose consumption and lactate production that are indicators of an increased glycolytic activity. Preventing the glycolytic burst using an hexokinase inhibitor strongly reduced the TLR4-dependent induction of the costimulatory molecule CD86 and the secretion of cytokines, indicating that upregulation of glycolysis is required for proper DC maturation. These results are in agreement with previous studies showing that TLR4 signalling induced in murine bone marrow-derived DCs a transition of cellular metabolism to aerobic glycolysis, similar to the Warburg effect described in cancer cells [27] [28] [29] . A similar metabolic switch was also described for murine M\u03a6 s stimulated by LPS and resulting in a proinflammatory \"M1\" phenotype, again consistent with the effect of 2DG on M\u03a6 cytokine secretion induced by LPS [51] [52] [53] [54] . More generally, glycolysis is important to support DC activation through various PRR to initiate the synthesis of molecules that are critical for cellular functions. In culture, less than 10% of DC can be infected by influenza virus so that glucose consumption and lactate production does not vary at the population level (data not shown). However, DC can still detect the virus through various PRR and react by secreting cytokines. Glycolysis inhibition of DCs by 2-DG reduced cytokine secretion triggered by influenza virus detection (Supplementary Table 1 ). Glycolysis was also found to be essential for anti-viral response triggered by human plasmacytoid DCs 55 . These observations raised the question of whether pathogens that interfere with TLR4 activation could perturb the regulation of glucose metabolism of innate immune cells. Although there is accumulating evidence indicating that cell metabolic profile is crucial for immune cell function, the molecular mechanisms involved in this functional fine-tuning have not been described so far for human monocyte-derived DCs. In murine DCs derived in vitro from bone marrow, two different molecular pathways have been depicted for glycolytic reprogramming. TLR4 signalling involving the activation of TBK1-IKK\u03b5 and AKT kinases was found to control the early increase in glycolysis 27 . The late increase in glycolytic metabolism upon TLR4 stimulation was found to be a survival response of murine inflammatory DCs to maintain their ATP production despite the inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation by NO . production 28 . Although we cannot exclude a contribution of NO . in the metabolic regulation of DCs by TLR4, we were unable to measure significant NO .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 122, "end": 124, "text": "50", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 812, "end": 816, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 817, "end": 821, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 822, "end": 826, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1040, "end": 1044, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1045, "end": 1049, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1050, "end": 1054, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1055, "end": 1059, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2401, "end": 2403, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2638, "end": 2640, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1613, "end": 1620, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "production by monocyte-derived DCs (data not shown) and this is in agreement with previous results obtained for human M\u03a6 s 56 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 123, "end": 125, "text": "56", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Recent studies suggest that influenza-induced lethality and ALI are due to the TLR4-stimulating effects of DAMPs such as OxPAPC and HMGB1, which are both TLR4 agonists. In vitro, HMGB1 can stimulate monocyte-derived DCs, inducing proinflammatory cytokine secretion and FP7 prevented DC activation by HMGB1 (Supplementary Fig. S4 ). In vivo, FP7 not only strongly reduced influenza infection-induced lethality, but also significantly improved the histopathology scores of infected lungs. FP7 prevented excessive inflammation and lung tissue damage and improved the survival rate in this model. FP7 administration also strongly reduced cytokine mRNA and protein production and HMGB1 levels ( Table 1) induced by influenza infection. In this model, influenza infection induces a cytokine storm and the accumulation of oxidized products of phospholipids in infected lungs or circulating HMGB1, both of which are inhibited by Eritoran therapy 38, 39 . Given the inhibitory effect of FP7 on the level of cytokines and HMGB1 induced by PR8 infection, it can be reasonably assumed that the benefit of FP7 treatment of influenza virus-infected mice is linked to its ability to inhibit TLR4 signalling by DAMPs like HMGB1 and the subsequent TLR4-dependent cytokine storm.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 938, "end": 941, "text": "38,", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 942, "end": 944, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 306, "end": 328, "text": "(Supplementary Fig. S4", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 690, "end": 698, "text": "Table 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The mechanism of action of FP7 has been studied by dissecting its physical interactions with CD14 and TLR4.MD-2 40 . FP7 was designed as a mimetic of lipid X, a biosynthetic precursor of lipid A, and docks well into MD-2 binding cavity 40 . This molecule revealed an unexpectedly high affinity for CD14 and it induces in bone marrow-derived M\u03a6 s selective endocytosis of CD14, but not of the TLR4.MD-2 complex 40 . That could impact TLR4 signalling in monocytes and M\u03a6 s which express membrane-bound CD14. It was previously shown in murine cells that CD14 promoted LPS-induced TLR4 endocytosis, favouring TRIF-dependent signalling that required internalization of TLR4 5 . These conditions are expected to antagonize TLR4 signalling more effectively than simply competing with LPS for CD14, and TLR4.MD2 binding. Monocyte-derived human DCs do not express membrane-bound CD14 and although soluble CD14 present in the serum can serve as a co-factor for LPS binding on TLR4, enhancing both MyD88-and TRIF-dependent signalling 57 , this soluble receptor cannot trigger internalization. This difference with monocytes may explain why the IC 50 of FP7 is slightly higher for DCs than for monocytes. Synthesis of FP7 which is a diacylated monosaccharide requires a short procedure giving high yield that is suitable for scale-up. The good bioavailability, high water solubility, lack of toxicity, and selective TLR4 activity make FP7 an ideal compound to be developed as a new drug that targets TLR4-related microbial and sterile inflammatory diseases.
