In this research study, long-range all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were engaged for the bound and the unbound proteins to enhance the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the Hsp90 dimerization and inhibition. Results evidently showed that coumermycin A1 (C-A1), a recently discovered Hsp90 inhibitor, binds at the dimer's active site of the Hsp90 protein and leads to a substantial parting between dimeric opposed residues, which include Arg591.B, Lys594.A, Ser663.A, Thr653.B, Ala665.A, Thr649.B, Leu646.B and Asn669.A. Significant differences in magnitudes were observed in radius of gyration, root-mean-square deviation and root-meansquare fluctuation, which confirms a reasonably more flexible state in the apo conformation associated with it dimerization. In contrast, the bound conformer of Hsp90 showed less flexibility. This visibly highpoints the inhibition process resulting from the binding of the ligand. These findings were further validated by principal component analysis. We believe that the detailed dynamic analyses of Hsp90 presented in this study, would give an imperative insight and better understanding to the function and mechanisms of inhibition.

Amongst other proteins, Hsp90 is one of the most profuse proteins in the cytoplasm, where it makes up approximately 1-2 % of the total protein levels (Anon n.d.). It is responsible for the controls of activities, such as the maturation, localization of a selected large number of substrates called ''client proteins'' in the cytoplasm. These clients proteins are part of several processes including transcription, translation, mitochondrial function, kinetochore assembly, inflammation, immunology, cellular antiviral defense pathways, apoptosis, centrosome function and cell cycle [18, 30, 39] . Studies have demonstrated that the replication of viruses to be sensitive to Hsp90 inhibitors at very low concentrations without affecting cellular viability, due to their dependence in Hsp90 for their survival.

Micro-molecule inhibitors such as C-A1 prevent the dimerization process of by targeting the dimer of Hsp90. We believe a more conformational rigid system was due a dimerization process being mired. This was indicated after the analysis of the RMSF and R g proving a more conformational supple nature of unbound Hsp90, whereas the C-A1-bound conformation of Hsp90 was found to be more stable with a declined dimerization throughout the MD simulation. The binding of C-A1 to the Hsp90 dimer subunits inhibits the process of dimerization. Observing the distance between the residues that are involved in the dimerization process further validates this.
