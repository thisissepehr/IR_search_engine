A black lemur group was habituated and observed during the day and night for all months of the year (total 1272 h). When fruits were eaten, the plant species was identified, the maturity of the fruit and treatment of the seeds noted, and the fruit described in terms of ripe fruit color, husk thickness, fruit length, and seed length and width. Black lemur feces were searched for seeds; these were identified and signs of damage noted. Other potential dispersers feeding on the fruits of species eaten by the black lemur were also noted. The black lemurs were seen eating the fruits of 70 species. Of these, 51 species were defined as closely associated with black lemur dispersal and 16 species had seeds that were either often preyed upon or wasted by the black lemur, or were seen being eaten by other potential seed dispersers. Fruits of species in the former group were often dull colored (94% of species); rarely less than 1 cm long (6%); rarely had seeds less than 0.1 cm long or less than 0.1 cm wide (2 and 4%, respectively); never had seeds more than 4 cm long or greater than 2 cm wide; and quite often had either thick husks (49%) or thin husks (51%). In contrast, the h i t s of the latter group were often brightly colored (75% of species) and nearly always had a thin husk (94%). Also, this latter group included more small and very large fruits and seeds than the former group. Fruit characteristics significantly associated with the former group were: dull color, thick husk, fruit length greater than 2 cm, seed length 1-4 cm, and seed width 1-2 cm.

Birkinshaw (1995) tested the viability of visibly undamaged seed samples defecated by the black lemur for 29 plant species.

Some seeds from all species germinated and the mean percent germination was 73.1. In addition, Birkinshaw (1995) estimated (for 16 plant species) the percentage of seeds swallowed by the black lemur during the day that were deposited below the parent plant and fruiting conspecifics.

These attributes were chosen because previous studies have shown that they are important in determining the class of frugivore that exploits a fruit (e.g., van der Pijl 1957 van der Pijl , 1969 Snow 1971; McKey 1975; Janzen & Martin 1982; Marshall 1983; Gautier-Hion et al. 1985; Pratt & Stiles 1985) . For this study, \"fruits\" were defined ecologically as \"the smallest independent seed-containing structure at the time when exploited by the frugivore.\" As such, \"fruits\" also included arillate seeds and aggregate fruits developing from several separate carpels within a single flower, and multiple fruits formed by maturation of many individual flowers in one inflorescence.

First, as a prosimian, the black lemur lacks acute color vision (Blakeslee &Jacobs 1985 , Bowmaker 1991 , Jacobs & Deegan 1993 ; therefore, brightly colored fruits would not be expected to be more attractive than dull colored fruits. Second, for a relatively large frugivore like the black lemur to feed on small fruits would represent sub-optimal foraging, unless these fruits occurred at high densities, had a highly nutritious pulp, or were available at a time of fruit scarcity. Some of the small fruits exploited by the black lemur were indeed produced at high densities; e.&, the 0.9 cm long and 0.8 cm wide fruits of Dypsis pinnatzpons were found on a large, many-branched infructescence such that there were several thousand fruits within a volume of ca 1 m3. Third, the black lemur ingests seeds and thus there is a physical limit to the maximum size of seeds that can be swallowed and thereby dispersed. The longest seeds recorded as dispersed by the black lemur were those of Cordyla madagacariensis (2 = 3.6 cm, SD = 0.2, N = 10) and the widest are those of Diospyros clusizj2ia (2 = 1.8 cm, SD = 0.1, N = 10).

The extent to which these lemurs have evolved to exploit fruits with the characteristics described above and/or the extent to which these fruit characteristics have evolved to promote seed dispersal by lemurs is unclear. Fischer and Chapman (1993) and Jordano (1995) have provided evidence that suggests, in general, fruit characterisitics are not closely coevolved with (i.~., they are exapted to) their recent disperser guilds; rather, many fruit characteristics can be explained largely by ancestry and are relatively persistent over time (i.e., similar fruits encounter a succession of different frugivore guilds). Jordano (1 995) has suggested that the evolutionary inertia of fruit characteristics is due to constraints imposed by development and integration with predispersal repro-ductive structures. Nevertheless, given the long period that the Malagasy flora has been isolated and the importance of lemurs in Madagascar's frugivore fauna during this time (Richard & Dewar 1991), the coevolution of at least some fruit characterisitcs (cg., fruit size; Jordan0 1995) with lemurs remains a possiblity.
