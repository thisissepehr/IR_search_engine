However, the UK study examined all patients admitted to an ICU whereas LUNG SAFE and our study examined the subset of patients who received mechanical ventilation. The overall 90-day mortality in our cohort of mechanically ventilated patients was high (49%). Similar mortality rates have been reported in other studies in LMICs [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . 90-day mortality was higher in those with ARDS at mechanical ventilation onset and those with ARDS after mechanical ventilation onset when compared to those who never developed ARDS. We also observed that the majority of study participants were ventilated with > 6 mL/kg PBW. Indeed, the mean tidal volume for patients with ARDS at mechanical ventilation onset was 8.7 mL/kg PBW. This is not in compliance with the ARDS Network trial recommendations of lungprotective ventilation with a tidal volume of \u2264 6 mL/kg predicted body weight and a plateau pressure of 30 cm of H 2 O [37] and highlights an area for improvement. In routine clinical practice, however, non-compliance with ARDS Network ventilation protocols has also been commonly reported in studies conducted in the USA. For example, an observational study conducted in 57 ICUs in the USA found a compliance of 50% with tidal volumes \u2264 6.5 mL/kg PBW in patients with ARDS [38] . In another observational study conducted in Maryland, USA, only 41% of ventilator settings in patients with ARDS were adherent to ARDS network goals [39] .

While average peak and plateau pressures were < 30 cm H 2 O, average driving pressures were > 15 cm H 2 O. This can be due to less than optimal lung recruitment, i.e., inadequate application of PEEP. The average set PEEP in this cohort of mechanically ventilated patients was 7.7 cm H 2 O. Although PEEP was higher in those with ARDS on presentation, higher levels of PEEP may actually be needed given high driving pressures. Lower driving pressure, irrespective of tidal volume, is associated with lower mortality in ARDS [40] . Therefore, individualized titration of PEEP through measurement of driving pressure and plateau pressure may improve clinical outcomes [41] . This along with low tidal volume ventilation can facilitate achieving lower driving pressures. While driving pressure at the initiation of mechanical ventilation was not associated with the development of ARDS after mechanical ventilation onset in our study, it is a known predictor of mortality in ARDS [29, 42] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 573, "end": 577, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 715, "end": 719, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1026, "end": 1030, "text": "[29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1031, "end": 1034, "text": "42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We identified potential factors at the initiation of mechanical ventilation which were associated with the development of ARDS after mechanical ventilation onset. Among the ventilator-related risk factors, higher mean airway pressures, higher peak airway pressures, and higher set PEEP at the initiation of mechanical ventilation were all associated with a higher incidence of ARDS after mechanical ventilation onset in adjusted analyses. The association between higher airway pressures (peak, mean airway, and PEEP) and ARDS development could reflect lung injury, but it could also reflect lesscompliant lungs that are sicker and more prone to ARDS development. Indeed, high airway pressures have been linked with early barotrauma and higher mortality [43] . In fact, peak inspiratory airway pressure was also identified to be a potential target to lower mortality in an ancillary analysis from the LUNG SAFE study [43] . High inspiratory flow, for a given plateau pressure or strain, may contribute to ventilator-induced lung injury likely by locally intensified concentration of stress [44, 45] . Higher mean airway pressures may also reflect patients with higher airway resistance, lower compliance, and more elevated respiratory rates which could reflect a greater dead space, all of which can identify a group of sicker patients who are more likely to get ARDS. Mean airway pressure reflects mean alveolar pressure throughout an entire respiratory cycle, which may better reflect the power applied to the lung and risk for injury throughout tidal breathing. Targeting peak or mean airway pressures, therefore, may play a role in preventing ARDS after mechanical ventilation onset.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 753, "end": 757, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 916, "end": 920, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1089, "end": 1093, "text": "[44,", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1094, "end": 1097, "text": "45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In contrast, we did not find an association between the development of ARDS after mechanical ventilation onset and either plateau pressures or driving pressures at the initiation of mechanical ventilation, two well-described predictors of ARDS mortality. Nonetheless, both plateau pressure and driving pressure at the initiation of mechanical ventilation were higher in patients with ARDS at the start of mechanical when compared to those who developed ARDS after mechanical ventilation onset or never developed ARDS. There are a couple of possibilities that may explain why we did not find an association between the development of ARDS after mechanical ventilation onset and either plateau of driving pressures at the initiation of mechanical ventilation. First, plateau or driving pressure may take longer to rise in relation to the time of onset of ARDS compared to peak or mean airway pressure. Therefore, plateau or driving pressures measured at the initiation of mechanical ventilation may not capture this relationship. Mean or peak airway pressures may be elevated earlier than plateau or driving pressures in patients who go on to develop ARDS later in the course of mechanical ventilation because physicians may set a higher inspiratory flow rate in response to compensatory tachypnea commonly observed in mechanically ventilated patients with metabolic acidosis resulting from sepsis or septic shock, pancreatitis, or trauma, all of which are well-known risk factors for ARDS. A set higher inspiratory flow rate will result in higher peak airway pressures whereas plateau or driving pressures are minimally affected [46] . Patients with sepsis may also have circulatory inflammatory mediators which causes bronchoconstriction and consequently higher airway resistance [47] [48] [49] . This also results in higher peak airway pressures whereas plateau or driving pressures are minimally affected. Patients may also have pulmonary edema that precedes radiographic changes before it causes flooding of alveoli, but which affects conducting airways and increases airway resistance [50] . Second, we had fewer measurements of plateau or driving pressures when compared to peak or mean airway pressure which could have affected our ability to measure a statistically significant difference. We may have had fewer measurements of plateau pressure or driving pressure because they can be cumbersome or difficult to achieve, as it requires a half second inspiratory hold on a ventilator to calculate driving pressure. In our study, nearly 30% (480) of the patients were missing a plateau pressure recording at the initiation of mechanical ventilation. Similarly, in the multinational LUNG SAFE study, plateau pressure was available in only 40% of patients with ARDS, again showing a deficiency of measurement of plateau pressure worldwide in the management of ARDS [29] . It is well established from clinical and animal studies that presumptive application of protective ventilation with low tidal volume to keep plateau pressure < 30 cm H 2 O can reduce the incidence of ARDS [51, 52] . Among patient-related risk factors, higher BMI in participants who did not have ARDS on presentation was significantly associated with the development of ARDS after mechanical ventilation onset. The association between BMI and development of ARDS after mechanical ventilation onset was not to differences in tidal volume. However, it was associated with a statistically significant difference between actual and predicted body weight. This suggests that excess adipose tissue in obese individuals may predispose them to an elevated risk for developing ARDS. Several mechanisms have been proposed for this association in previously published studies like obesity-induced adipokine imbalance [53] , obesityinduced endoplasmic reticulum stress-causing endothelium dysfunction [54] , chronic inflammatory state of obesity, and elevated neutrophils and cytokines that induce upregulation of adhesion molecules on lung epithelium and enhanced susceptibility to injury [55] . This association has previously been demonstrated in both animal and human studies and is not explained by initial ventilator settings in these individuals.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1628, "end": 1632, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1780, "end": 1784, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1785, "end": 1789, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1790, "end": 1794, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 2089, "end": 2093, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 2868, "end": 2872, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3080, "end": 3084, "text": "[51,", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 3085, "end": 3088, "text": "52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 3781, "end": 3785, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 3864, "end": 3868, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 4053, "end": 4057, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our study has some potential shortcomings. First, both higher airway pressure at mechanical ventilation onset and subsequent development of ARDS after mechanical ventilation onset could reflect an underlying severe lung injury rather than a causal effect. Regardless, they serve as an indicator of the development of ARDS in the future, in a cohort of patients who initially do not meet the criterion for ARDS and hence provide an opportunity for early intervention. In addition, the association was adjusted for baseline severity of illness score APACHE III accounting for some of the disease severity at presentation. Second, our study was designed before the publication of the Berlin definition, but the collection of necessary information allowed for the addition of parameters like PEEP to the existing definition to make the criteria more aligned with the Berlin definition. Third, we did not have information about the potential etiology of injury that could have led to the development of ARDS. This precluded us from calculating a Lung Injury Prevention Score (LIPS) at baseline which has been studied to identify those at risk for acute lung injury [56] . Choosing mechanically ventilated participants helped us to enrich our cohort with individuals who are at the highest risk of developing ARDS and enabled us to isolate iatrogenic risk factors in mechanically ventilated individuals. Overall, the observational design allowed us to study current practices and incidence of disease and identify gaps and areas of improvement. Fourth, because this is an observational study, we did not dictate how frequently physicians obtained chest X-rays or arterial blood gases while on mechanical ventilation. This may result in an underestimation of the ARDS incidence after mechanical ventilation onset.
