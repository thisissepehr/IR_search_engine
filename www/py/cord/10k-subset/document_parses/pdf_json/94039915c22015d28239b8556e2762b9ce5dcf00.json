Indeed, cell lines of neural origin 1, 2 and human primary cultures from the central nervous system (CNS) 3 are susceptible to infection by HCoV-OC43, and RNA was found to persist in human brain. 4 HCoV-OC43 can also cause a vacuolating encephalitis in mice 5 and RNA can persist for up to 1 year. 5a HCoV-OC43 uses the neural route via the olfactory bulb to gain access to the CNS, 6 but no such pathway has been described for HCoV-229E as it does not infect mice, probably because of lack of an adequate receptor. A possible alternative neuroinvasive pathway would consist in passage through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) by infection or passage through brain endothelial cells and/or transport by infected leukocytes. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a good case in point, where brain infiltration of infected T lymphocytes 7 or monocytes 8, 9 is crucial in initiating the neuropathology known as AIDS-dementia. It was previously reported that both OC43 and 229E could productively infect primary human monocytes/macrophages. 10 However, the results presented here rather suggest that only HCoV-229E productively infects human monocytic cells, while HCoV-OC43 infection is highly restricted. Moreover, the result obtained with the THP-1 cell line, which represents an excellent model to study the interaction between HCoV-229E and human monocytic cells, suggested that monocytes could be activated by infection and could serve as a reservoir and vector into the CNS for neuroinvasive HCoV-229E in vivo.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 136, "end": 138, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 139, "end": 140, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 206, "end": 207, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 296, "end": 297, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 358, "end": 359, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 398, "end": 400, "text": "5a", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 483, "end": 484, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 956, "end": 958, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 959, "end": 960, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1143, "end": 1145, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "with 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM pyruvate sodium, MEM non essential amino acids, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 \u00b5g/mL streptomycin, 2-mercaptoethanol 2 x 10 -5 M (Invitrogen), and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Wysent).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Leukocytes were isolated through Ficoll-Hypaque (Amersham) and PBMC were prepared at 2.5 x 10 6 /mL.
