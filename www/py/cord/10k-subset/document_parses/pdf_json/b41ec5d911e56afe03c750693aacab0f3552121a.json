It is an enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus with a genome consisting of more than 152,000 base pairs and a GC content of 68% [37] . HSV-1 causes a number of acute and reactivated infections that are usually limited to the oropharynx [57] . The nuclei of the sensory ganglia innervating the site of initial infection become sites of latency in which the virus exists in a non-replicating state for various periods of time [9, 43, 55] . Reactivation occurs in response to a variety of unrelated stimuli including emotional stress, fever, menstruation, immune suppression, surgery, and exposure to UV light [18, 19, 32, 42, 43] , although the frequency of reactivated lesions in infected individuals varies widely. In most cases, acute and reactivated infections are mild and self-limiting although, on rare occasions, HSV-1 can infect the central nervous system (CNS) and cause life-threatening encephalitis [57] . An explanation of what triggers these rare events is unknown. Given the close proximity of latent virus to the CNS and its propensity for reactivation, it is fortunate that the incidence of serious CNS disease is not more frequent. Unlike latent HSV-1 within the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which causes reactivated lesions at or near the site of the original infection, reactivation of latent HSV-1 within the CNS [2, 22, 23] can lead to herpes simplex encephalitis with such symptoms as confusion and behavioral changes, olfactory or gustatory hallucinations, as well as hemorrhagic or necrotic lesions within the cere-bral cortex [44] .

The seizures induced by the Vero cell-grown virus and the single seizure induced by the BHK-21 cell-grown virus were the same, consisting of bilateral facial tonic-clonic movements, with the rabbits assuming an unnatural sitting position with turning of the head to one side. Many of these seizures appeared to be of the Jacksonian type previously described for HSV-1 strain +GC-infected rabbits [47] . The rabbits also developed a patterned constellation of signs including wetness about the mouth, chin, forepaws as well as grinding of teeth and/or lethargy at time of sacrifice. There was no evidence that any animal became comatose. In addition, we observed one rabbit infected with 17syn+ grown in Vero cells that developed hindlimb paralysis.

As shown in Fig. 2 , shedding of virus over this time period was similar, regardless of the cell type used to propagate the virus. These results suggest that the lack of progression to a diseased state using BHK-21 cell-grown virus was not due to slower growth in corneal epithelial cells in vivo as compared to Vero cell-grown virus. Additionally, one-step growth curves on Vero cells (using 17syn+ grown in Vero cells) or on BHK-21 cells (using 17syn+ grown in BHK-21 cells) (Fig. 3 ) also demonstrated that virus grown in BHK-21 cells was able to replicate to high titers. As a final check on the ability of the virus to replicate, we repeated our one-step growth curves on rabbit corneal epithelial cells, again using 17syn+ grown in Vero or BHK-21 cells. The results from the growth curve on rabbit corneal epithelial cells are presented in Fig. 4 and, again, show that 17syn+ from BHK-21 cells was able to replicate to high titers. Indeed, the one-step growth curves demonstrated that 17syn+ in either BHK-21 or rabbit corneal epithelial cells replicated to higher titers than in Vero cells at many points during these assays (Figs. 3, 4) . These results suggest that the attenuation observed in vivo is not due to a growth defect of the virus, but rather is due to a feature(s) unique to BHK-21 cells. Use of 17syn+ grown in Vero or BHK-21 cells to determine the LD 50 following intracranial (ic) and ocular infection of BALB/c mice yielded identical LD 50 values (LD 50 \u22641 by ic inoculation and 10 5.9 by ocular inoculation), thus providing additional support for the idea that the observed attenuation was not due to an inability of the virus to replicate (data not shown). These latter results also imply that the attenuation observed in vivo is, in addition to being cell-type specific, animal species-specific. During the course of the one-step assay in rabbit corneal epithelial cells (Fig. 4) , we observed that the BHK-21 cell-derived virus grew more slowly than the Vero cell-derived virus between the 10-and 30-h time points. One possibility is that this slower growth might result in an attenuated infection in vivo, perhaps by giving the host immune system a chance to respond before the virus can replicate widely within the CNS. However, based upon our data the slower growth does not provide an adequate explanation for the attenuation observed in vivo for the following reasons. The first is that the time of appearance and severity of eye lesions observed in both groups of rabbits was not significantly different (Tables 1  and 2 ). In vivo, it appears that the BHK-21 cell-grown virus was able to replicate similarly over the same time frame as the Vero cell-grown virus (see Fig. 2 ).

Our in vivo results raise some very intriguing questions, particularly about the differences between BHK-21 cells and Vero cells that are responsible for such a significant decrease in virulence. One obvious possibility could be glycosylation differences on one or more of the surface proteins that are involved in early interactions with cell surface components which, in turn, affect the infectious process. Two possible candidates are glycoproteins B and D (gB and gD), both of which are major viral membrane glycoproteins that play important roles in fusion, interactions with specific cell surface molecules, and rate of entry [29, 30] . Alterations of the glycosylation pattern on these or other viral membrane proteins could have profound effects on infectivity. Poss et al. [35, 36] demonstrated cell-type specific glycosylation of the surface glycoproteins of feline immunodeficiency virus to be responsible for a virus able to form syncytia and cause cell death in primary feline astrocytes versus a virus only able to cause an avirulent, persistent infection of Crandell feline kidney cells. Similarly, cell-specific differences in protein processing and/or glycosylation were shown to affect pathogenicity of Friend spleen focus-forming virus [16] and to alter host range of HIV [6] .

H particles are complete infectious virus particles, while L particles lack the viral capsid and DNA and are noninfectious [51] . In subsequent experiments, Yang and Courtney [58] demonstrated that the formation of L particles was cell-type specific as nearly equal numbers of H and L particles were produced in BHK-21 cells, while in Vero cells the predominant particle formed were H particles; either no L particles were formed or they were formed in such small quantities as to prevent purification for analyses [58] . These results demonstrate a cell-specific effect on HSV-1, in vitro, that was observed with BHK-21 cells but not Vero cells. It is noteworthy that we also observed a cell-specific effect in vivo with the same cells. Support for a cell-specific effect came from our use of virus from BHK-21 cells that was passaged a single round back through Vero cells. While we had predicted that the virus would be as neurovirulent as when grown in Vero cells, the intermediate results that we obtained (Table 3) suggested that growth in BHK-21 cells prevented 17syn+ from re-gaining full virulence.

In other words, H and L particles would continue to be formed in equivalent amounts throughout the course of infection in the rabbit brain. L particles would, therefore, be able to bind to the same cellular receptors utilized by the infectious H particles since L particles apparently contain similar glycoproteins in their envelope as complete virions [51] . Thus, L particles would be able to \"compete\" with H particles for receptor binding and prevent infectious virus from initiating successful rounds of replication. High numbers of L particles have recently been shown to interfere with infectious virus binding to cellular receptors in vitro [10] . Fewer infectious particles able to replicate in cells of the CNS could, conceivably, result in an attenuated infection. This idea also implies that L particles are as immunogenic as infectious H particles, which is consistent with our histological analyses (Fig. 5) where we found no differences in the severity or location of brain lesions between the two sets of rabbits. Likewise, our in vivo results using Vero cell-grown virus are also consistent with this idea in that lack of L particle formation in Vero cells yielded a virus that was not attenuated initially in the original inoculum nor subsequently as the virus replicated in the CNS.

These results suggest some effect on virulence as a result of having been grown in BHK-21 cells that was not completely overcome by the single passage back through Vero cells and that resulted in intermediate neurovirulence.
