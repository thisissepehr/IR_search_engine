To evaluate possible effects of ABHR applications on glove integrity, thirteen brands of nitrile and latex medical exam gloves from five manufacturers and two different ABHRs were included in this study. A pair of gloves were worn by a test operator and the outside surfaces of the gloves were separately treated with an ABHR for 1-6 applications. Tensile strength and ultimate elongation of the gloves without any ABHR treatments (control gloves) and gloves after 1-6 ABHR applications were measured based on the ASTM D412 standard method. In general, tensile strength decreased with each ABHR application. ABHRs had more effect on the tensile strength of the tested nitrile than latex gloves, while ethanol-based ABHR (EBHR) resulted in lesser changes in tensile strength compared to isopropanol-based ABHR (IBHR). The results show that multiple EBHR applications on the latex gloves and some of the nitrile gloves tested should be safe for Ebola PPE doffing based on the CDC guidance. Appropriate hospital staff practice using ABHR treatment and doffing gloves is recommended to become more familiar with changes in glove properties.",

            "text": "The 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa was the largest in history, and occupationally acquired infections became a significant component of the epidemic in healthcare settings. [1] In the most affected country Sierra Leone, the confirmed Ebola incidence was 103-fold higher in healthcare workers (HCWs) than that in the general population. [2] The disease is most commonly spread through direct contact with blood or bodily fluids. To prevent transfer of Ebola virus from the patient to HCWs and vice versa, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a detailed guidance on the types of personal protective equipment (PPE) to be used and on the processes for donning and doffing PPE for all HCWs entering the room of a patient hospitalized with Ebola virus disease, first in October 2014 and then revised in August 2015. [3] The guidance for use in the United States recommends that the HCWs wear full body coverage PPE during patient care. After care is completed, the PPE items are removed by the HCW with double gloving to increase the safety margin, and alcohol based hand rub (ABHR) is recommended for disinfecting the gloves at multiple times during the PPE doffing in health care settings.",

            "text": "ABHRs contain one or more alcohols, including ethanol, isopropanol, n-propanol, aminomethylpropanol, benzylalcohol, and phenoxyethanol. However, commercially available ABHRs are predominantly either ethanol or isopropanol. [4] Although the doffing process can be completed within 3-5 min, concerns were raised that multiple applications of the ABHR may cause chemical degradation of the gloves, thus putting HCWs at high risk. Degradation is defined as a deleterious change in one or more physical properties due to processes that are induced under the influence of chemicals brought in contact with the gloves. Several test methods have been developed for evaluating material degradation. [5] [6] [7] Of them, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 1999 on Protective Clothing for Emergency Medical Operations [6] is a pass/fail test that specifies requirements for emergency medical operations' protective clothing, including emergency medical examination gloves and emergency medical work gloves, to protect personnel performing patient care during emergency medical operations from contact with blood and body fluid-borne pathogens. Although there are additional performance requirements in the NFPA1999 that are related to firefighter performance, tensile property is believed to be more relevant to CDC-recommended PPE doffing process for Ebola. [3] Tensile strength and ultimate elongation are sensitive mechanical properties that are widely used as industry standard measures of glove quality and polymer performance, and serve as indicators in evaluating glove degradation. [8, 9] Tensile strength is the maximum tensile stress applied in stretching a specimen to rupture, while ultimate elongation is the elongation at which rupture occurs in the application of continued tensile stress. [10] They are designed to simulate the failure mode that occurs from glove donning which can lead to breaking and tearing. [11] This study evaluated the effect of multiple ABHR applications on the tensile properties of thirteen brands of medical exam nitrile and latex gloves. Previous studies found that nitrile and latex medical examination gloves are comparable during in-use performance. [12, 13] The primary aims of this study were to provide HCWs with useful information in selection of medical exam gloves and to understand the effect of ABHR during doffing of PPE used for protection against Ebola virus.",

It was found that this brand is the only latex among the five brands in this study that was sent to Underwriters Laboratory [15] by its manufacturer for certification and met NFPA Standard on Protective Clothing for Emergency Medical Operations. [6] Although certification of gloves to NFPA 1999 by the glove manufacturers is voluntary and the standard does not test gloves with ABHR, the gloves that meet this standard may be superior performing when subjected to ABHR. On the other hand, the thinnest glove (Brand B) had the smallest elongation and the second lowest tensile strength that was, however, not statistically different with the lowest tensile strength of Brand E. However, linear regressions of tensile properties against thickness indicated correlations with tensile strength was better than elongation (linear correlation coefficients (r) of 0.53 and 0.37, respectively). As shown in Table 3 , minor decreases of the tensile strengths between 0.3 and 3.3% were observed for four out of the five brands after six EBHR applications, and the changes were not statistically different compared to their control gloves (p > 0.05). The other (Brand E) that had the lowest tensile strength experienced the largest decrease of the tensile strength after each additional application, and the changes were statistically different. Overall, mean tensile strength decreased 4.3% (p > 0.05) for all the latex gloves. However, EBHR was able to enhance tensile strength for three brands (A, B, and D) after four applications. On the other hand, the latex gloves exhibited slight increases of elongations, excluding the thickest Brand C that had minor decreases after each application. The largest increase of the elongation was observed for the thinnest Brand B (p < 0.05). It is noted that, for tensile strength, Brand E with the lowest value experienced the largest amount of decrease after each application. For elongation, all of the brands increased after each application from the beginning, except for the thickest latex glove, which decreased with each application. However, the changes were relatively small and, in general, not statistically significant (p > 0.05).",

Brand H, the second thinnest brand but not statistically different with the thinnest Brand L, had the lowest tensile properties. Brand H also exhibited the lowest elongation after each application-up to six times. Unlike the latex gloves, tensile properties of the control nitrile gloves were not the same when comparing Figure 4 and Figure 5 . As with the latex gloves, this may be due to the variability between nitrile gloves from different purchases/lots, as well as experimental uncertainties.",

            "text": "Generally, our study shows that latex gloves had superior tensile strength properties compared to the nitrile gloves. This is consistent with another study showing that latex gloves were less stiff than nitrile gloves following stretching. [18] Similarly, another study found that NFPA 1999 certified emergency medical exam gloves made of nitrile (650%) had lower elongation compared to latex (850%). [11] Thickness of the gloves were similar with this study. Furthermore, EBHR had a smaller effect than IBHR. The different effects could be somewhat explained by polymer solubility, i.e., polar chemicals will tend to dissolve polar polymers and nonpolar solvents will tend to dissolve nonpolar polymers. [19] Higher solubility of the ABHRs would result in a larger effect on the gloves. According to the polarizability, [20] both ABHRs are polar but ethanol is slightly more polar than isopropanol. For the gloves, nitrile is more polar than latex. Therefore, both ABHRs would have a smaller effect on latex than nitrile gloves. In addition, EBHR containing 70% ethanol would have a smaller effect (less solubility) on latex gloves among the four glove/ABHR combinations (i.e., latex-EBHR, latex-IBHR, nitrile-EBHR, and nitrile-IBHR). These were well supported by the results. For the nitrile gloves, however, the results cannot be merely explained by the solubility, probably due to the small difference of the polarizability between the two ABHRs. Moreover, other factors might also play a role on the changes in tensile properties differently. These include other ingredients existing in the ABHRs (as much as 30-37%), the way the gloves were made including different constituents, chemicals, and plasticizers added during manufacturing, etc. Applications of the ABHR could remove certain additives such as plasticizers. [7] No two gloves are identical though they may be the same generic type. [21] While changes in tensile properties were not practically significant for most of the glove/ABHR combinations, application of IBHR did cause all the tested gloves to become sticky after three or four applications. It is likely that the stickiness is caused when the isopropanol (a known solvent) in IBHR removes plasticizers or other additives in the glove material. Changes in the way the gloves feel may be alarming to end users, so we recommend that hospital safety professionals conduct training and encourage practice of PPE doffing techniques periodically with the specific models of gloves and ABHR used in their hospital. This will help to reduce the chances that unexpected changes in glove properties would be surprising to the HCW during an actual event. Switching the type of glove or the type of ABHR product used may be necessary if decreased glove integrity (e.g., they start to tear or rip) or unusual changes (e.g., excessive stickiness, shrinking, or hardening) that would affect work-related tasks are observed during training and practice.",

The ABHRs decreased tensile strength while increasing ultimate elongation to a much lesser extent. Generally, the effect was greater on the nitrile than on the latex gloves. In addition, EBHR resulted in less changes in tensile strength compared to IBHR. There was a trend that changes in the tensile strength increased when increasing the number of ABHR applications. The smallest effect was observed for latex gloves treated with EBHR, while the largest effect was found for nitrile gloves treated with IBHR. Overall, EBHR has little to no effect on elongation of most tested gloves but with notably decreased tensile strength for nitrile gloves after up to six applications. Nevertheless, all tested gloves still met NFPA 1999 glove requirements in tension strength and elongation, except for two brands of relatively thin nitrile gloves (Brands H and M).
