As the philosophy and practice of advanced care for tiny infants becomes more acceptable and affordable in the country, a steady increase in survival of such infants is predictable. However there is growing concern in India that NEC could become a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality in the future. NEC is currently regarded as the most common acquired gastrointestinal emergency in the newborn period, and the outcome of this disease is universally poor. Improved understanding of the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of this condition is required for formulating optimal principles of prevention and management.

The first case with signs and symptoms similar to NEC was described by Genersich in 1891 in a 45 hour old premature infant who died within 24 hours. Since then there have been several case reports. However, it was recognised as a syndrome and described by Mizrahi et al. in 1965 in what is referred to as the landmark report. = As most of the studies published early on NEC were retrospective in nature, Ryder et al conducted a multicentre prospective case control study which was published in 1980. 2 The results of this study showed that incidence of NEC was 2% of all admissions to the neonatal intensive care units and several factors were found on multivariate analysis to be significantly associated with NEC. Low 5 minute apgar score, patent ductus arteriosus, maternal receipt of anaesthesia during delivery, enteral feeding on 10% dextrose, early gavage feeds and premature rupture of membranes were factors considered significant. Since then several studies have attempted to define the contribution of various aetiological factors precisely and they shall be referred to and discussed later.",

The particular properties of breast milk that account for its protective nature are immunological defence factors and non-immunological defence factors. In addition to IgA immune protection is believed to be provided by anti-inflammatory components, namely PAF acetylhydrolase, Vitamin E, B-carotene and ascorbic acid. Human milk lipids may be less toxic to the intestinal epithelium. Nutrients such as glutamine and nucleotides enhance gastrointestinal cell metabolism and function. Also breast milk contains many growth factors and hormones that may improve function and maturity. It is also understood that the cysts of pneumatosis contain methane + CO2 + hydrogen and bacterial fermentation is the only known source of hydrogen gas.
