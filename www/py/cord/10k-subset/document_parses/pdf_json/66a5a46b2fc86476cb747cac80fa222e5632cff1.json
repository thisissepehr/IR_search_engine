Blood transfusion in trauma patients has been demonstrated to be an independent predictor of mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, length of hospital stay, and infection regardless of degree of shock [3, 4] . Allogeneic blood transfusion also is associated with numerous additional side-effects to include febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), viral transmission (cytomegalovirus [CMV] , human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] , hepatitis), and transfusion-related immunomodulation [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Donor leukocytes present in the allogeneic blood have been implicated as a potential cause of these complications. Proposed mechanisms include induction of T-cell anergy in the recipient, decreased natural killer cell function, altered ratio of T helper to T suppressor cells, and soluble proinflammatory cytokines produced by leukocytes during storage [13] [14] [15] . Together, these effects can suppress the recipient immune system and promote a worse proinflammatory state leading to increased infection and complications [16] . This has led many investigators to suggest that the use of pre-storage leukoreduced (LR) blood may mitigate some of the immunomodulatory effects of allogeneic blood transfusion and reduce associated morbidity and mortality [6, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 187, "end": 190, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 191, "end": 193, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 406, "end": 409, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 410, "end": 412, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 639, "end": 644, "text": "[CMV]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 676, "end": 681, "text": "[HIV]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 737, "end": 740, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 741, "end": 744, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 745, "end": 748, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 749, "end": 752, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 753, "end": 756, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 757, "end": 761, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 762, "end": 766, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 767, "end": 771, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1127, "end": 1131, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1132, "end": 1136, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1137, "end": 1141, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1300, "end": 1304, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1530, "end": 1533, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1534, "end": 1538, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1539, "end": 1543, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1544, "end": 1548, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1549, "end": 1553, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1554, "end": 1558, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Numerous randomized controlled trials and several observational studies in medical and surgical patients have compared rates of infection, organ failure, and mortality in patients receiving either LR or standard, non-leukoreduced (NLR) blood [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] .

Patients in the mixed group received more blood overall and were more likely to require a massive transfusion despite having ISS similar to patients in the other groups. Greater than 50% of the mixed group received massive transfusions compared to less than 20% in the other groups. In most cases, it is likely that the patients in the mixed group received both LR and NLR blood because their transfusion needs exceeded the blood bank supply of either type of blood. It is because they received both types of blood that the mixed group had more ICU days, more hospital days, more ventilator days, and higher MODS scores. Massively transfused patients had similar baseline characteristics and outcomes between all three groups. Based on these findings, we conclude that patients received both LR and NLR blood because the blood bank was acutely overwhelmed and did not have enough of either type of blood to meet the patients' requirements with one type alone. This introduces an obvious bias in that while the ISS was similar, the need for a massive transfusion predicts a more severely injured patient.

To limit heterogeneous data interpretation, research individuals were assigned a given outcome measure to evaluate rather than a series of patients and charts.
