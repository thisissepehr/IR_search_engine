Bleomycin-induced lung injury or BILI is from release of cytokines and free radicals, related to low levels of bleomycin hydrolase (BLMH) in the lung. BLMH deactivates bleomycin. It is believed that in the presence of higher inspired oxygen concentrations, free radical formation increases, accelerating lung injury. This leads to an immunologically mediated inflammatory response causing a pneumonitis, eventually culminating in pulmonary fibrosis [2] . Bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicity is seen in about 40-45% of patients with a mortality reaching 3%. Risk factors include age, smoking, cumulative drug dose, poor renal function, concomitant use of oxygen, and radiation therapy.",

The purpose of this assessment among other things is to clarify patient and surgical specific risks and recognize when such a risk can be optimized in a patients favor. Cancer-related fatigue and treatmentinduced physiological derangements make it difficult to identify where the source of physiological dysfunction lies. It may be impossible to assess the integrity of the cardiovascular system based on physical activity (a key determinant of cardiac integrity in ACC/AHA guidelines). When on top of this, a patient has undergone therapies that are cardio toxic, the picture becomes fuzzier. One then has to rely on investigations like serial troponins, echocardiograms, and their interpretations to determine as true a cardiac status as possible. If cardiac injury is found, then one must determine the necessity vs risk of surgery and the effects of delaying cancer therapy. If we do need to \"cancel\" a case, we must ensure that the time gained by this delay is primarily used to reduce the assessed risk that has resulted in the delay. These decisions have to be made in conjunction with the patient, surgeon, and oncologists involved in patient care. The dialog should be transparent with clearly established goals.
