Such information, particularly when integrated with geospatial data, can have translational applications for a variety of fields, including public health. Estimated effective migration surfaces (EEMS) is an approach that allows visualization of the spatial patterns in genomic data to understand population structure and migration. In this study, we developed a workflow to optimize the resolution of spatial grids used to generate EEMS migration maps and applied this optimized workflow to estimate migration of Plasmodium falciparum in Cambodia and bordering regions of Thailand and Vietnam.",

Topological skeletons were used to capture the spatial distribution for each genomic cluster and to determine the EEMS grid density; i.e., both genomic and spatial clustering were used to guide the optimization of EEMS grids. Model accuracy for migration estimates using the optimized workflow was tested and compared to grid resolutions selected without the optimized workflow. As a test case, the optimized workflow was applied to genomic data generated from P. falciparum sampled in Cambodia and bordering regions, and migration maps were compared to estimates of malaria endemicity, as well as geographic properties of the study area, as a means of validating observed migration patterns.",

            "text": "Often estimates of population structure are made without regard to the geographic coordinates of sampling locations and then later interpreted in the context of the geographic information. However, approaches have been developed that model both the spatial and genomic data. One such approach, called estimated effective migration surfaces (EEMS) [9, 10] , uses genomic data for a species to visualize the spatial contours of migration and diversity for this species for a given study area. The model broadly assumes isolation-by-distance, whereby genetic similarity and geographic distance are negatively correlated, and identifies areas where genetic similarity decays faster than expected for a given geographic distance (low effective migration) and areas where genetic similarity decays more slowly than expected for a given geographic distance (high effective migration). The model output is a map of areas of high and low effective migration or diversity for the study region. An assumption underlying EEMS is that the population structure is consistent with isolation-by-distance and as such, EEMS results represent effective (i.e., relative) rather than absolute migration rates and are likely to capture patterns associated with more historic timescales. It should be noted that the EEMS toolkit has also been expanded to support identity-by-descent approaches and estimations of migration and population-size surfaces for more recent time scales with the MAPS toolkit [11] . For a historic understanding of migration patterns in a region, EEMS is a useful tool and has been used, for example, to understand the population structure of human populations in southern [12] and eastern [13] Africa and in Europe [14] , and to visualize barriers and corridors of gene flow associated with human migration in Scandinavia [15] and Peru [16] . EEMS has also been applied to simulate historical gene flow patterns for the gray wolf (Canis lupus) [17] and the blunt-nosed leopard lizard Gambelia sila [18] , and to investigate the genetic diversity of Atlantic Bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean Sea [19] . In this paper, we use EEMS to estimate migration surfaces for Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest human malaria species.",

EEMS maps are visuallyintuitive and may be useful to malaria elimination programs by identifying defined geographic areas that can be targeted with interventions. However, to be useful for this purpose, it will be important to reduce spatial uncertainty in the EEMS contours that can arise from userdefined parameters, such as the resolution of the spatial grid used in the model. The spatial grid is a grid of regular triangles that covers the study area. Each vertex in the grid represents a deme, and EEMS uses the number of demes selected by a user to generate the spatial resolution of its spatial grids. The random selection of the number of demes can result in a high standard deviation among posterior distributions estimated using EEMS and in turn, higher levels of spatial uncertainty in the migration contours generated by EEMS. For example, if the grid is too sparse (i.e., relatively fewer demes), then many sampling locations may be assigned to a single deme, reducing model accuracy through excessive smoothing of genomic differences. On the other hand, if the grid is too dense (i.e. relatively high numbers of demes) spatial uncertainty may result from estimation of parameters for many demes lacking genomic data [20] . In addition, the number of demes included in the analysis has a substantial impact on computing time, with computing time scaling cubically with the number of demes. Researchers typically employ either an average of the results obtained from running multiple MCMC iterations using different numbers of demes to infer migration patterns [9, 17, 22, 23] , or apply maximum likelihood values to guide selection of the number of demes [20] . In both cases, users must run EEMS at multiple grid resolutions, which can be time-consuming.",

The grid is created using two user-defined parameters, a bounding box that defines the geographic area where gene flow will be modeled, and the number of demes, where a deme represents a vertex in the grid. The EEMS toolkit allows the number of demes to vary up to a maximum value of 1000, allowing for different grid resolutions. Genomic data from a given sampling location is assigned to the nearest deme, and the model uses the deme locations to estimate and map effective migration surfaces. EEMS assumes individuals migrate locally between subpopulations (at demes) and that migration rates vary by location. The model also assumes that each subpopulation exchanges migrants only with its neighbors (i.e., a stepping-stone model). For every triangle in the grid, EEMS assigns diversity estimates to demes and migration estimates to triangle edges. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are employed to estimate both migration and diversity parameters by sampling from their posterior distributions given observed genetic dissimilarities. The matrix of average pairwise genetic dissimilarities is computed using bed2diffs, and EEMS is then run using runeems_snps: a C ++ implementation of EEMS for SNP data. For each iteration, two sets of Voronoi tessellations are generated, representing spatial patterns of migration and diversity respectively. These tessellations are generated based on a user-defined value nseeds that represents the number of Voronoi cells and that is also assigned to the grids. The two Voronoi tessellations are independent of each other and are updated with a birth/death process since the number of Voronoi cells is initially unknown. A maximum likelihood method is commonly used to adjust estimates of diversity and migration so that simulated genetic dissimilarity rates fit observed genetic dissimilarity in both cases.",

For each cluster, a kernel density map was generated based on sample sizes and locations. A natural breaks classification was used to group each kernel density map into binary categories of high and low sample density, respectively. This classification method minimized the average deviation from the class mean and maximized the deviation from the means of the other groups. It also reduced the variance within classes while maximizing the variance between classes. The category representing the highest sample density was selected to determine the spatial distribution of boundaries that represent each cluster and from which triangle lengths could be established. Since the cluster polygons were often irregularly shaped, the topological skeletons of polygons were used to capture polygon shapes. To represent the spatial distance between clusters, the nearest distance between each pair of topological skeletons was computed. Finally, the shortest distance between each pair of clusters was determined and selected to represent the maximum length of a triangle edge in the grid. To determine the number of demes that optimizes the grid, this optimized triangle edge length was used as input in an inverse function to the EEMS grid generation function with the result that the edge length of the generated EEMS grid is shorter than the optimized triangle edge length. In this way, both genomic and spatial clustering were used to guide the optimization of triangle sizes and the density of demes, i.e., grid resolution, used for generating P. falciparum parasite migration maps.

To evaluate our optimization strategy, we used EEMS to generate migration surfaces for a range of grid resolutions from 200 to 750 demes, and compared the model accuracy and computing times for these grids with the optimized grid (Fig. 5) . Using a grid of 200 demes had the poorest performance with R 2 = 0.38 (Fig. 5a) . A grid of 400 demes also had a slightly lower R 2 value of 0.748 compared to the optimized grid (R2 = 0.757). And while R 2 values appeared to increase for grids with more than 550 demes, these cases were associated with excessive computing times (Fig. 5b) . The computing time for the 350-demes case (approximately 13 h) was much less than for 400 demes (28 h), 500 demes (39 h), 600 demes (73 h) and 700 demes (112 h).

EEMS migration contours can vary-sometimes substantially-based on the selected number of demes. Therefore, having a systematic, rational approach to determine grid density will likely be helpful to EEMS users. We were able to test and show that optimized grids displayed both high model accuracy and reduced processing time compared to grid densities selected in an unguided manner. In addition, when we utilized an optimized grid to generate EEMS migration maps for P. falciparum, we found that migration contours reflecting the parasite population structure corresponded to estimates of malaria endemicity and geographic properties of the study region (e.g., landcover and large waterbodies) that might be expected to impact malaria parasite migration. The results of our genomic clustering approach indicated the presence of multiple genomic clusters based on malaria parasite genomic data generated from isolates collected in provinces in western, northwestern, and southwestern Cambodia. This finding is consistent with previous analyses of subsets of these data that found multiple sympatric genetic subpopulations of parasites that were hypothesized to have originated as founder populations resulting from the emergence of artemisinin resistance [40] [41] [42] . The congruence of these findings suggests that the density clustering approach applied in our optimization framework is accurately capturing known patterns of parasite genetic diversity in the study area.",

However, use of the optimized grid allowed detection of a migration barrier in Pailin Province that was not identified in our previous analysis that is consistent with malaria elimination efforts in this area that have contributed to a dramatic decline in clinical malaria incidence [51] [52] [53] . P. falciparum migration barriers in northern Cambodia may have been due to higher urbanization (lower vegetation coverage) north of Tonle Sap Lake as well as Tonle Sap Lake itself, which is a large enough waterbody that it may have served as a barrier to P. falciparum migration. Deforestation of cardamom forests and large-scale land acquisitions in the area corresponded to the southern part of the ring-like contour of low migration and may also have been a contributor to this migration barrier [54, 55] . The Mekong River running through southeastern Cambodia as well as the urbanized area of Phnom Penh, may both have contributed to reduced parasite migration in this part of Cambodia. The fact that detected migration hotspots and barriers were geographically related with landcover and hydrologic features underscores the role that geography plays in shaping parasite population structure, which is consistent with findings from other studies, for example, a major migration barrier was detected around the Andes Mountains in Peru [56] .",

Improving local geographical granularity may aid in detecting more detailed migration patterns. Further investigation is also required to improve our understanding of any boundary effects in EEMS analyses, as well as the impact of the assumption of geographic uniformity across a study area implied by use of a uniform grid, since geographic uniformity is not assumed for all studies [57] , and is an assumption that is likely violated in many settings, including in studies of the malaria parasite as presented here.",

Computing the analyses using different grid resolutions indicated that optimizing the number of demes offered the best performance for producing migration estimates with a significantly reduced computing time, an important consideration if maps are to be used to guide intervention strategies. We tested the optimized EEMS workflow on data generated from parasite isolates collected in Cambodia and bordering regions of Thailand and Vietnam, and found that migration contours corresponded to estimates of malaria endemicity and geographic features in the region that might be expected to impact malaria parasite migration (e.g., landcover, large waterbodies), supporting the validity of EEMS migration estimates. While in this study, our optimization framework was applied to malaria parasites, we believe this workflow is generalizable for other study areas and pathogens and can be used to guide the generation of migration maps based on available genomic sample distributions.
