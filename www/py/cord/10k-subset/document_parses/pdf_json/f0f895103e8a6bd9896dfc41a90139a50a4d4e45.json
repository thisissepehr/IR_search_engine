Design: Single case report and a review of the ECLS database. Setting: Tertiary referral hospital paediatric intensive care unit. Patients and participants: A single case report of an infant with B. pertussis infection is described. Despite receiving ECLS, this infant died from overwhelming cardiac and cerebral insults. Outcome for children receiving ECLS registered on the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization database is reviewed. Measurements and results: The mortality of infants receiving ECLS for B. pertussis infection is high, with only 5 survivors reported among 22 registered cases. The majority of nonsurvivors had evidence of circulatory collapse in addition to severe respiratory failure, and these patients commonly died of hypoxicischaemic cerebral insult. These data suggest the existence of a subgroup of patients with respiratory failure only, who may benefit from ECLS, and a larger subgroup who suffer ischaemic cardiac and cerebral insults which are unlikely to be improved by ECLS. Conclusions: The value of ECLS in patients with B. pertussis infection who present with major cardiac dysfunction is questionable. Such patients almost invariably have a poor outcome despite maximal therapy. rate of 160 beats/min and had a percutaneous arterial oxygen saturation of 95 % in room air. Chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates with consolidation of the right middle and upper lobes. Full blood count showed haemoglobin 11.1 g %, total white cell count 9200 10 6 /l and platelet count 298 000 10 6 /l. A clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis was made although respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) immunofluorescence of a nasopharyngeal aspirate was negative, as was immunofluorescence for chlamydia. Bordetella pertussis serology and nasopharyngeal swab were collected.",

Pulmonary pressures were estimated to be suprasystemic. Inhaled nitric oxide was administered (commenced at 8 parts/million and increased to 80 parts/million).

Both groups were placed on ECLS (usually for \u00aafailure to respond to maximum treatment\u00ba) after a relatively short period of ventilation (survivors: mean 4.0 days; nonsurvivors: mean 3.5 days). The periods of ECLS were similar (survivors: mean 222 h; nonsurvivors: mean 289 h). The two groups showed a similar degree of respiratory compromise as demonstrated by ventilation index and alveolar-arterial oxygen difference immediately prior to ECLS.",

It seems, however, that colonisation of the respiratory epithelium is important in the development of serious disease, as mice infected intraperitoneally with chambers containing B. pertussis remained healthy despite developing antibody responses [11] . It has been suggested that damaged epithelium would compromise mucociliary clearance and so promote further B. pertussis proliferation and enhance local delivery of toxins. Whether the ensuing pulmonary hypertension results from a haemodynamic effect of such a locally delivered toxin or results from associated hypoxia, hypercapnia, acidosis, tissue injury or even iatrogenically from vasoactive drugs (or any combination of the above) is not clear. The rapidity and severity with which severe pulmonary hypertension evolved in our patient was impressive. Increase of pulmonary vascular resistance is known to occur in infants and children with pneumonia of multiple aetiologies [12]; however, this case clearly represented the most severe end of a spectrum of such changes. Hyperventilation and alkalinisation were not able to ameliorate this pulmonary hypertension. Inhaled nitric oxide as a selective pulmonary vasodilator was also unsuccessful. The possible aetiological significance of the pulmonary venous leucocyte thrombi in the genesis of this pulmonary hypertension must remain speculative at this time. The leucocytoclastic bronchopneumonia we found at autopsy is characteristic of fatal pertussis as is a pulmonary leukaemoid reaction [13] .",
