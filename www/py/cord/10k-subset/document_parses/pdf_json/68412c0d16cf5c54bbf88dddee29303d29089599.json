Bacterial pneumonia can induce uncontrolled and massive neutrophil recruitment ultimately leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and epithelium damage. Interleukin-22 plays a central role in the protection of the epithelium. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the role of interleukin-22 and its soluble receptor IL-22BP in an acute Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia model in mice. In this model, we noted a transient increase of IL-22 during Pseudomonas aeruginosa challenge. Using an antibody-based approach, we demonstrated that IL-22 neutralisation led to increased susceptibility to infection and to lung damage correlated with an increase in neutrophil accumulation in the lungs. On the contrary, rIL-22 administration or IL-22BP neutralisation led to a decrease in mouse susceptibility and lung damage associated with a decrease in neutrophil accumulation. This study demonstrated that the IL-22/IL-22BP system plays a major role during Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia by moderating neutrophil accumulation in the lungs that ultimately leads to epithelium protection.",

During infection, the host must activate a robust but adapted immune response against the pathogen while protecting the integrity and the functionality of the lungs.

This duality of IL-22 functions during inflammation probably reflects the significance of tissue context in determining the balance of IL-22 protective vs. deleterious actions on epithelial cells. In support of this idea, Sonnenberg et al. previously showed that during bleomycin-induced acute lung injury, the tissue-protective effects of IL-22 are overwhelmed by pro-inflammatory properties owing to the synergistic actions with IL-17 to recruit PMNs 20 . Therefore, it is not surprising that IL-22 possesses a specific system of regulation that is an IL-22 Binding Protein (IL-22BP), a secreted, soluble and specific inhibitor 21 which we previously showed to be produced by a specific subset of immature dendritic cells in rodent gut that negatively regulates the protective actions of IL-22 during DSS-induced acute colitis 22, 23 .",

We addressed the impact of the in vivo administration of recombinant IL-22 before infection on lung damage after infection. As shown in Fig. 5a , intra-tracheal administration of 100ng of rIL-22 18 hours before the induction of pneumonia greatly decreased epithelial cell damage and lung oedema. In particular, rIL-22 administration significantly attenuated shrinking of the alveolar space during infection at 6 and 24 hours (Fig. 5b , p < 0.05 and p < 0.001 respectively). Since rIL-22 administration did not have an impact on bacteria load during pneumonia (Fig. 5c) , we suspected an effect of rIL-22 on the host response. rIL-22 administration led to a moderate but significant decrease in PMN recruitment during infection as shown by Ly6-G IHC (Fig. 5d, right panel) and Ly6G surface staining quantification (Fig. 5e, p = 0.03) . Interestingly, rIL-22 administration prior to infection tended to decrease MIP-2 expression in the lungs of infected mice compared with PBS-treated mice (p = 0.17) in contrast with IL-22 neutralisation which led to an increase of CXCL2 expression (Fig. 5f ). IL-22 action is restricted to epithelial cells owing to the specific expression of the IL22RA1 receptor chain in these cells. Since IL-22 neutralisation impacted CXCL2 levels in the lungs and PMN recruitment, we explored the ability of rIL-22 to directly modulate IL-8 production on human epithelial A549 cell lines.

However, in contrast to S.J. Aujla et al. in a K. pneumonia pneumonia model 10 , pulmonary IL-22 level modulation by exogenous administration or antibody neutralisation did not affect pulmonary bacterial loads compared with the untreated animals. The absence of bacterial burden modification suggests that the protective action IL-22 is not mediated by its direct anti-bacterial properties but rather through the ability of IL-22 to modulate host inflammatory response and susceptibility. To the best of our knowledge, the role of AMP in mucosal immunity in lungs has been poorly studied. It may be hypothesized that like in the gut, RegIII-\u03b3 regulates bacterial virulence by maintaining a zone of physical separation between the mucosal surface and bacteria without the need to decrease bacterial burden 28 . RegIII-\u03b3 could also interfere with the lung microbiome and decrease the virulence of PA.",

In our model, IL-22 acted as an anti-inflammatory molecule since it was correlated with PMN recruitment in the lungs. Tuning appropriate host response, especially PMN recruitment in response to pathogen aggression, is critical for host survival. PMN recruitment and activation during bacterial infection is a double-edged sword 30 . Neutropenic mice display exacerbated susceptibility of PA pneumonia 31 and neutrophil depletion (by i.v. administration of Ly6-G neutralisation antibody) which led to a fatal lung infection in our model within 12 hours (data not shown). Failure to properly control PMN accumulation following pulmonary infection will contribute to tissue damage and ARDS 26, 30, 32 . In the context of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Guillon et al. showed that PMN proteases may alter IL-22 pathways leading to an increase in tissue damage 33 . The current results confirm that PA may alter the outcome of pneumonia through a massive recruitment of PMN in the lungs, thereby enhancing pulmonary lesions. Confirming these data, prophylactic administration of IL-22 correlated with a decrease in CXCL2 levels and PMN accumulation during infection. Although intra-tracheal administration of rIL-22 in the lung suggests a local effect, we cannot exclude systemic spreading of rIL-22 especially to the liver, an organ known to highly express IL22RA1. For example, in a model of pneumococcal pneumonia, G. Trevero-Nunez et al. demonstrated that liver-specific IL22RA1 deletion resulted in an increase of bacterial burden in the lungs 34 .",

In our model, IL-22 could act as an immune-modulatory cytokine with anti-inflammatory properties. It is consistent with the role of this cytokine in the VILI model of Hoegl et al. where the authors found, aside from CXCL2 modulation, an increase of the immune-modulatory protein SOCS3 expression after IL-22 stimulation 37 .

            "text": "-22 is transient during PA pneumonia. In this context of epithelium damage, we assessed the expression of the interleukin (IL)-22 during PA pneumonia (Fig. 2). PAO1 infection induces a tremendous and transient IL-22 mRNA increase at 6 hours of infection (Fig. 2a). This is correlated with the transient increase of IL-22 protein levels in the lungs of infected mice 6 and 24 hours after the onset of pneumonia (p < 0.01) followed by a drop back to IL-22 basal levels at 48 hours (ns; p = 0.4 compared with the sham group) (Fig. 2b). IL-22 detection on paraffin-embedded lung sections confirmed this transient IL-22 increase (Fig. 2c). IL-22 positive pixel surface quantification revealed that after an initial increase, IL-22 positive staining in the 48-hour infected lungs was significantly decreased compared with the sham group (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2d).IL-22 in vivo neutralisation increases mice susceptibility to infection.In order to assess the relevance of IL-22 in the context of PA pneumonia, IL-22 and IL-22BP neutralising antibody-based approaches were conducted. Intravenous administration of neutralising IL-22 antibody 18 hours before the induction of pneumonia led to the abolition of the IL-22 protein increase in the lungs of the 24-hour infected mice(Fig. 3a)whereas a slight IL-22 increase, although not significant (p = 0.08), was observed in IL-22BP neutralised mice at 6 hours of infection. To confirm the relevance of IL-22 neutralisation in vivo, antimicrobial peptide REGIII\u03b3 mRNA was monitored while IL-22 regulated REGIII\u03b3 expression 11 . IL-22 neutralisation is correlated to a decrease in REGIII\u03b3 mRNA expression in the lungs of infected mice(Fig. 3b). It is of interest to note that IL-22 neutralisation led to enhanced mouse susceptibility to infection(Fig. 3c, left panel. p = 0.04) whereas IL-22BP neutralisation decreased it(Fig. 3c, right panel. p = 0.03). This increased susceptibility in IL-22 neutralised animals was correlated with an increase in lung damage and oedema (Fig. 3dand e. p = 0.03), thereby demonstrating the protective role of IL-22 during PA acute pneumonia.",
