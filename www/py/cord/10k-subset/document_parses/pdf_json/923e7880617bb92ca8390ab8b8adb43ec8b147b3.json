Knowledge of the spatial and temporal characteristics of influenza is important in evaluating and developing disease control programs. This study aims to describe an accurate spatiotemporal pattern of influenza at the prefecture level and explore the risk factors associated with influenza incidence risk in mainland China from 2005 to 2018. The incidence data of influenza were obtained from the Chinese Notifiable Infectious Disease Reporting System (CNIDRS). The Besag York Molli\u00e9 (BYM) model was extended to include temporal and space-time interaction terms. The parameters for this extended Bayesian spatiotemporal model were estimated through integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) using the package R-INLA in R. A total of 702,226 influenza cases were reported in mainland China in CNIDRS from 2005-2018. The yearly reported incidence rate of influenza increased 15.6 times over the study period, from 3.51 in 2005 to 55.09 in 2008 per 100,000 populations. The temporal term in the spatiotemporal model showed that much of the increase occurred during the last 3 years of the study period. The risk factor analysis showed that the decreased number of influenza vaccines for sale, the new update of the influenza surveillance protocol, the increase in the rate of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 among all processed specimens from influenza-like illness (ILI) patients, and the increase in the latitude and longitude of geographic location were associated with an increase in the influenza incidence risk. After the adjusting for fixed covariate effects and time random effects, the map of the spatial structured term shows that high-risk areas clustered in the central part of China and the lowest-risk areas in the east and west. Large space-time variations in influenza have been found since 2009. In conclusion, an increasing trend of influenza was observed from 2005 to 2018. The insufficient flu vaccine supplements, the newly emerging influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 and expansion of influenza surveillance efforts might be the major causes of the dramatic changes in outbreak and spatio-temporal epidemic patterns. Clusters of prefectures with high relative risks of influenza were identified in the central part of China.

Correspondently, we found more areas with high relative risk in these 4 years in the space-time term. This implies that the more sporadic the activities are, the larger the variations in the spatiotemporal distribution of the risk of influenza. In contrast, the large outbreaks account for most ILI activities in the years 2009, 2010, 2017 and 2018. Few prefectures were observed to have a relative risk greater than 2 or 3 during that period.

This work adds to the existing research on influenza epidemiology in the following ways. First, the study initially presents the spatiotemporal distributions with higher-resolution spatial data than has been reported in China for the last 14 years, which allows more opportunity for focused investigations and interventions. Next, we used the exceedance probabilities instead of the observed risk estimates to identify those areas for which the increased risk was highly unlikely to be due to chance.

Clusters of prefectures with high relative risk values concerning influenza incidence were identified in the central part of China. The identification of high-risk areas is especially a priority in China because the limited resources available for disease control need to be focused on the places most in need. We hypothesize that the insufficient flu vaccine supplements, low vaccine uptake, the newly emerging influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 and expansion of influenza surveillance efforts might be the major causes of the dramatic changes in outbreak and spatiotemporal epidemic patterns.

In order to account for the changing spatiotemporal patterns of influenza in China, we defined or collected covariates that may be associated with the risk of influenza at the national level.
