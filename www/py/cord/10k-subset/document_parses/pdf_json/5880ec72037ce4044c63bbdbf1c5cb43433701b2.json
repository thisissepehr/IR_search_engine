A 6-week-old male, second twin, with a history of prematurity (36 weeks of gestation), with no respiratory pathology in the neonatal period, was admitted to our pediatric intensive care unit because of bronchiolitis (direct immunofluorescence test positive for RSV is nasopharyngeal smear), manifested by respiratory distress and apneic spells. Two days after admission to the PICU, atelectasis of the left lung developed and the patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient developed left pneumothorax requiring pleural drainage, and over the next 48 h there was progressive respiratory deterioration with increasing hypoxemia. A chest X-ray revealed generalized bilateral alveolar infiltration and severe hypoxemia (PaO2) 56 mmHg), despite increased respiratory support with pressure-controlled ventilation and continuous flow, with pressures 40/7 cm H20, respiratory rate 42 breaths/rain, FIO z 1, and inspiratory:expiratory ratio 1 : 1.0. As there was no response to elevations of PEEP (maximum PEEP of 12 cm H20), treatment with nitric oxide in concentrations up to 20 ppm was performed 5 days after intubation with no improvement in oxygenation. 24 h later, treatment with porcine surfactant (Curosurf) instilled through the intratracheal tube at 50 mg -1 kg -1 dose was administered. Four doses were administered over a 36-h period. After the second administration of surfactant, a fast improvement in oxygenation occur- Table 1 Ventilatory settings and oxygenation indices before and after treatment with NO and four doses of surfactant (A -DO 2, Alveolar -atertial oxygen gradient; a/A 02, Arterial alveolar oxygen ratio; Oxygenation index, Mean airway pressure \u2022 FIO2/PaO2;",
