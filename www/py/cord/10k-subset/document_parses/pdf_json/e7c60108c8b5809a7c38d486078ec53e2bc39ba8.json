Judging by their apparent molecular weight, the 140 K polypeptide is probably a dimer of gIV (71 K). The dimer was not reduced to a monomer by boiling in 2-mercaptoethanol, indicating that it is not linked by disulfide bonds. However, following purification of gIV, the dimer is more prevalent than after immunoprecipitation of [3SS]methionine-labelled BHV-t infected cells. Since during immunoaffinity purification of gIV the NP 40 concentration is decreased [17] , the 140 K species is probably a noncovalently linked dimer of 71 K-gIV.

None of these monoclonal antibodies mediated immune lysis of virusinfected cells to any extent, whereas some monoclonal antibodies against BHV-1 glycoproteins gI and gIII showed lysis activity at dilutions greater than 1 : 10,000 [19] .

This suggests that this antigenic domain is a separate, independent epitope. Furthermore, it can be implied from the monoclonal antibody characterization data that this epitope is a discontinuous epitope containing amino acid residues from different parts of the glycoprotein. This was suggested by the inability of the antibody to recognize denatured antigen in ELISA or detect gIV on a Western blot. It is also important to note that 3 E 7, when acting as a competitor, showed some interaction with other antigenic domains. There appeared to be intermediate, non-reciprocal competition with 3 C 1, a member of antigenic domain 3. It also appeared to enhance the binding of 2C8 of domain 3 and 136 of domain 1, in a nonreciprocal manner. Interestingly, neither of these monoclonal antibodies recognised denatured antigen in ELISA and therefore probably recognise discontinuous epitopes. A possible mechanism for this process is that 3 E 7 binds to domain 2, causing distortion of gIV in the envelope resulting in alterations in other unrelated epitopes, seen as enhancement of binding. Coronavirus studies also indicate enhancement of up to 100% in the binding of specific monoclonal antibody pairs [7] , and this was also shown with BHV-1 gIII [15] .",

The differences in their levels of reactivity may be due to differences in avidity when competing for an identical site, or they may represent overlapping sites. The latter is probably the case when taken with the monoclonal antibody characterization data. The two clones reacted similarly in all tests with the exception of recognition of denatured antigen in ELISA; 9 D 6 was positive in this test and 136 was negative. Data from the post-adsorption neutralization assays strongly suggest that this domain is responsible for the penetration of the virus into the cell after viral attachment. Both monoclonal antibodies exhibited post-adsorption neutralizing ability although 136 was more efficient than 9 D 6. None of the other monoclonal antibodies showed any trace of post-adsorption neutralization. This confirms the observation that gIV is responsible for penetration of BHV-1 and indicates that antigenic domain 1 is the same as the antigenic domain II a on gIV reported earlier [ 15] . Evidence from gD of HSV-1 suggesting that gD is not involved in attachment of the virion but in its uptake into the cell [3, 8] also strengthens this hypothesis. Monoclone 136 showed enhanced binding following incubation with competing monoclonal antibodies 3 E 7 from domain 2 and 10C2 from domain 3, which suggests that binding to these epitopes caused distortion of the glycoprotein permitting easier access for monoclonal antibody 136 to its discontinuous epitope. However, no or very slight enhancement of binding of monoclone 9 D 6 was observed, which is consistent with the observation that the epitope recognized by this antibody is probably continuous, since it reacted in Western blotting and it showed an ability to recognize gIV after denaturation in an ELISA ( Table 2) .",

            "text": "The final antigenic domain, domain 3, is recognized by a group of monoclonal antibodies which recognized either exactly the same epitope or overlapping epitopes on gIV. The situation in domain 3 is probably similar to that of domain 1 in that the different monoclonal antibodies represent overlapping epitopes rather than avidity differences for the same epitope. This was indicated by the antibody characterization data shown in Table 2 . Each clone showed a different pattern of behaviour in Western blotting and ability to recognize denatured antigen. Clone 10 C 2 competed most strongly with the other members of this group. This may be due to high avidity or it may overlap with each of the other 3 epitopes. This clone also shows the maximum range of detection ability. Epitopes 3b and 3d probably overlap with each other and with 3a because they share similar characteristics, whereas epitope 3c probably only overlaps with 3a. The proposed interrelationship between these epitopes is shown in Fig. 5 . Domain 3 is probably discontinuous, at least in part, as has been indicated earlier in the discussion of domains 1 and 2. This domain was involved in non-reciprocal enhancement and competition by other domains. Furthermore, the antigen recognition data suggest that different parts of the glycoprotein brought together by secondary and/or tertiary structure contribute to the epitopes.",
