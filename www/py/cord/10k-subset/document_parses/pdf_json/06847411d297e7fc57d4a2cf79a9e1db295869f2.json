There were also bilateral mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, metastatic nodules, ground glass densities and consolidation in dependent regions with left pleural effusion. Another bronchoscopy was performed, confirming left upper bronchus extrinsic compression. Bronchial biopsy demonstrated carcinomatous lymphangitis with a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.

Several procedures have been proposed, but there is no preferred procedure of choice between CT scan or bronchoscopy with either BAL, bronchial or transbronchial lung biopsy [16, 17, 18, 19] . In one study of chronic diffuse infiltrative lung disease, a CT scan associated with clinical and radiological findings could make a correct diagnosis of lymphangitic carcinoma in 92% of cases [19] . In a recent study, transbronchial lung biopsy and BAL were proposed to determine the etiology of pulmonary infiltrates in mechanically ventilated patients because of thei safety and diagnosis yield. However, lymphangitic carcinoma was not present [20] . An analysis of 530 cases revealed that multiple transbronchial lung biopsy (more than five) had a diagnosis yield in LC of 68% of cases [18] .",
