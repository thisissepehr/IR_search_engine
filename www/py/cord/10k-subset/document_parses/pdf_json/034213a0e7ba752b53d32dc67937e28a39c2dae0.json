            "text": "The mortality rate in JDM has fallen to less than 5% with contemporary treatment [5] . In recent years, ILD has been reported as the major cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with polymyositis-dermatomyositis with a rate of 5-30%, depending on the method used to assess lung involvement [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Four main types of ILD have been reported in patients with polymyositisdermatomyositis: type (I): acute presentation where fever, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates appear in less than 2 weeks; type (II): insidious disease with dyspnea, cough and pulmonary infiltrate; type (III): asymptomatic pulmonary infiltrates without respiratory symptoms; type (IV): normal HRCT and chest X-ray findings with abnormal respiratory function tests [10] . For the first case, acute ILD (type I) with symptoms of dyspnea, fever and respiratory failure appeared after 2-3 weeks of the disease. However, the second patient had no lung involvement at the beginning and he had normal chest CT. The insidious ILD (type II) occurred 14 months after the onset of JDM. Pulmonary involvement was documented with HRCT.",

[9] reported a group of dermatomyositis patients who had slight muscular symptoms, slightly elevated serum creatine kinase levels, negative anti-Jo-1 but rapidly progressive ILD. Our patients had negative anti-Jo-1 antibodies. Shibuya et al. [14] reported 'Mechanic's Hands' in three patients complicated with ILD and mild muscular involvement without myositis. They proposed that 'Mechanic's Hands' can occur in association with foot lesions and interstitial pneumonia even if it is not accompanied by myositis. 'Mechanic's Hands' developed in our first case who had fulminant course complicated with ILD.",

They concluded that fatty change seen in more than 50% of patients with collagen tissue disease may be due to steroid treatments. Hepatic biopsy of the second patient revealed nonspecific reactive hepatitis and fatty liver changes prior to steroid treatment. We thought that the coexistence of hepatic and pulmonary involvement might have caused the unfavorable outcome in the second case.",
