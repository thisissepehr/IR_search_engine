Experimental models have long been used to mimic features of ARDS pathophysiology, but the presence of distinct subphenotypes among preclinical ARDS remains unknown. This review will investigate whether: 1) subphenotypes can be identified among preclinical ARDS models; 2) such subphenotypes can identify some responsive traits. Methods: We will include comparative preclinical (in vivo and ex vivo) ARDS studies published between 2009 and 2019 in which pre-specified therapies were assessed (interleukin (IL)-10, IL-2, stem cells, beta-agonists, corticosteroids, fibroblast growth factors, modulators of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products pathway, anticoagulants, and halogenated agents) and outcomes compared to a control condition. The primary outcome will be a composite of the four key features of preclinical ARDS as per the American Thoracic Society consensus conference (histologic evidence of lung injury, altered alveolar-capillary barrier, lung inflammatory response, and physiological dysfunction). Secondary outcomes will include the single components of the primary composite outcome, net alveolar fluid clearance, and death. MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases will be searched electronically and data from eligible studies will be extracted, pooled, and analyzed using random-effects models.

Despite decades of research, mortality due to ARDS remains high, with significant long-term comorbidity and reduced quality of life in survivors [2] . Various pharmacotherapeutic agents have failed to improve ARDS outcomes and current treatment strategy is largely supportive, based on optimized ventilatory settings [1] .

These two phenotypes are sometimes referred to as \"endotypes\" because they seem defined by distinct degrees of inflammation, but their underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. However, these subphenotypes were stable over the first 3 days of enrolment in both RCTs, suggesting that they are linked to true biological processes. The hyper-inflammatory subphenotype demonstrated significantly worse outcomes when compared to the hypo-inflammatory subphenotype, with higher mortality and lesser ventilator-free and organ failure-free days. The analysis of plasma biomarkers in patients with ARDS previously enrolled in the MARS prospective cohort also identified two biological subphenotypes, which were very similar to those found earlier and were again associated with distinct mortality rates [10] . In the AL-VEOLI trial, where a lower positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) strategy was compared to a higher PEEP strategy, the two subphenotypes demonstrated a distinct response in terms of major outcomes, suggesting the potential for using this subphenotypic classification to identify therapy responsive traits. This hypothesis was further confirmed through secondary analysis of the fluids and catheters treatment trial (FACTT) in which the two inflammatory subphenotypes had distinct effects of the randomly assigned fluid management strategy on 90-day mortality [11] . The potential for the inflammation-based subphenotypic classification was again demonstrated in a secondary analysis of the hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibition with simvastatin in acute lung injury to reduce pulmonary dysfunction-2 (HARP-2) trial, a multicenter trial investigating the potential of simvastatin as an anti-inflammatory therapy for ARDS.

Such data will be crucial to confirm the potential of personalized ARDS medicine [6, 8, 46] , i.e. the promise to deliver the right -targeted-treatment to the right subject. These data will also inform on the potential value of testing candidate therapies (including therapies that have already been tested in previous studies) that target distinct functional and/or pathobiological processes (such as lung epithelial injury and alveolar inflammation [9, 47] ) in select experimental models that might best mimic ARDS subphenotypes described in patients to date [6] . For example, although it seems plausible that tracheal instillation with hydrochloric acid causes prominent injury to the alveolar epithelium and live bacteria (such as Streptococcus pneumoniae) causes major alveolar inflammation profiles, it remains unknown whether these models might have reliable value to represent clinical subphenotypes of higher inflammation and of higher degree of lung epithelial injury, respectively [6] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 348, "end": 351, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 352, "end": 354, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 355, "end": 358, "text": "46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 718, "end": 721, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 722, "end": 725, "text": "47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 829, "end": 832, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1261, "end": 1264, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our review is timely since there is an increasing amount of research dedicated to the identification of ARDS subphenotypes, their underlying mechanisms, and their potential responsive treats [4, 7, [9] [10] [11] [12] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] . The results from this study should therefore be useful in order to generate hypotheses on whether some therapies (see Table 2 ) might differentially benefit to some preclinical subphenotypes, as compared to others. In case of positive results, this might open new perspectives on preclinical precision therapies, with the ultimate goal of future clinical translation. However, the predefined, limited number of therapies investigated through our review (see Table 2 ) is a limitation that should be acknowledged; this limited number reflects both our specific research topics of interest and a balance between scientific validity and feasibility. Our results will inform on whether the nature of the lung injurious hit used in published experimental models of ARDS could identify subphenotypes with distinct degrees of severity and treatment effects. Yet, we might not be able to distinguish such subphenotypes using individual subject data analysis in a given experimental model, such as recently reported in a secondary analysis of a murine cecal ligation and puncture sepsis model, with one subphenotype characterized by faster deterioration and more severe inflammation than the other and distinct responses to some interventions (immediate versus delayed antibiotics and fluids) [53] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 191, "end": 194, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 195, "end": 197, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 198, "end": 201, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 202, "end": 206, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 207, "end": 211, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 212, "end": 216, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 217, "end": 221, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 222, "end": 226, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 227, "end": 231, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 232, "end": 236, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 237, "end": 241, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1528, "end": 1532, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 362, "end": 369, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 702, "end": 709, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In a broader perspective, we also hope this review will increase our knowledge on, and identify challenges and barriers related to, the conduct of preclinical ARDS studies.
