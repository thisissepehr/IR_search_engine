For example, after the 2003 SARS coronavirus outbreak in Toronto, a postmortem tissue examination of 20 patients documented a diffuse alveolar damage pattern associated with lung injury, as well as signs of an aspergillosis fungal infection in the lungs of 2 patients. 1 Likewise, Dr. Auger says, the sudden appearance of rare pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) infections shortly after the emergence of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune defi ciency syndrome (AIDS) in the 1980s became a key cytopathology signpost pointing toward a virus-mediated immunodefi ciency. When researchers realized the PCP pathology was linked to HIV in many cases, she says, they reviewed other PCP-related cases and found signs of the virus. \"So, those cases of PCP helped resolve other unexplained events in the past,\" Dr. Auger says.",

Dr. Koenig has developed some of these protocols for frontline responders and hospital personnel, including a triage screening approach she calls \"vital sign zero.\" 2 Before assessing a patient's traditional vital signs, she says, the approach asks providers to pause and ask whether the scene has been secured from the threat of passing on an infectious disease. Beyond asking symptomatic patients to use specifi c entrances, the preparations could involve donning personal protective equipment and establishing isolation zones around patients believed to be contagious.",

If you're seeing something unusual, then law enforcement would need to be alerted too. For example, we should never see a smallpox patient.\" An effective vaccine can bring an outbreak to a dramatic halt. However, vaccine development takes time and money, and requires a more sustainable investment than typically is available. \"We have funding at the federal level that can be activated after certain types of disasters, such as hurricanes or earthquakes. But we don't really have a good pot of money that's set aside for the emerging infectious disease scenario,\" Dr. Koenig says. Being more prepared, she says, may mean adopting an \"all-hazard\" approach that promotes education, training, and consistent funding to help the medical community respond to next big threat, whatever it is and wherever it emerges.",
