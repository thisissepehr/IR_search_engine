The main task of protecting the population against influenza pandemics requires state of the art approaches to the construction of influenza vaccines to be based on reassortment and genetic engi neering techniques, including the analysis of primary structures of influenza viral genes, synthesis and cloning of the main viral genes, reverse genetics techniques, and banks of plasmids bearing basic viral genes. Reassor tant technologies are now giving way to new approaches for objective reasons. The state of the art technol ogies provide safety not only at the laboratories where vaccine viruses are constructed but also make the pro duction process wholly safe. We are using the following approaches to the development of industrial produc tion: use of nanoparticles and nanoemulsions as functional adjuvants, construction of totally safe strains for live attenuated influenza vaccines with deletions of molecular determinants of pathogenicity, application of protein and chemical chaperones to provide self assembly of haemagglutinin molecules of the H1N1v 2009 virus, and impregnation of whole virion preparations with nanoparticles to enhance antigenicity.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The level of protection against the avian flu epi zootic and the influenza pandemic caused by the swine lineage H1N1v virus can be characterized as insufficient for Russia's population.

The PB1 F2 protein belongs to the amphiphilic proteins causing, similar to bacterial tox ins, depolarization of membranes. It is probable that the main toxic effect of influenza infection is associ ated with hyperproduction of this protein. The PB1 F2 reading frame is completely preserved in the PB1 gene of the LAIV attenuation donors. Its deletion by the reverse genetics techniques leads to essential changes in the phenotypic properties of the virus [12]. Thus, deletion of the key determinants of pathogenic ity from vaccine viruses is a reliable strategy for raising the safety and harmlessness of LAIV.Table 4presents the improvement strategies for the current vaccines for the next 3-4 years. Subunit vaccines with adjuvants, including on nanocarriers, are becoming obvious leaders among vaccine preparations. Serious compet itors for LAIV are replicatively deficient \u0394NS1 vac cines.
