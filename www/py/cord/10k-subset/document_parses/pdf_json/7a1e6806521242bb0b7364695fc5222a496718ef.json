Subjects and methods Historical and present-day examples of attitudes towards immunisation and specific vaccines, both on the part of the public and of health-care workers, are reviewed. Results Decision-making with regard to vaccine policy implementation has been and is still most often driven by fear: fear of disease (when perceived as rampant and/or dangerous), but also fear of vaccine-associated adverse events (when the disease is less or no longer \"visible\"). However, methodology for introducing evidence-based immunisation policies exists and can be used by public health authorities, while vaccination information systems (such as the Swiss InfoVac) have proven their usefulness in providing trustworthy, peer-based knowledge to health-care workers. Conclusion Only information based on clear, evidencebased data gathered and analysed according to solid methodological criteria coupled with adequate information of health-care workers (and thus patients) can ensure in future the implementation of scientifically coherent, publicly acceptable, and equitable immunisation policies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Keywords Evidence-based medicine .

When a disease is perceived as dangerous, people are eager to be protected, even if a varying degree of opposition to immunisation as such has always existed. Many historical examples illustrate this fact. For instance, the ravages wrought by poliomyelitis was the main incentive for over 400,000 American children to take part in what was then (1955) the largest clinical trial of a vaccine (Salk's inactivated polio vaccine, IPV) (Blume and Geesink 2000) . Shortly before (1948) (1949) (1950) (1951) nearly 14 million people were inoculated with BCG within the International Tuberculosis Campaign, despite debate surrounding the efficacy and safety of the vaccine. However, the willingness to use BCG cannot be separated from the dread of tuberculosis, particularly in the aftermath of the Second World War (Comstock 1994; Bryder 1999) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 526, "end": 550, "text": "(Blume and Geesink 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 568, "end": 574, "text": "(1948)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 575, "end": 581, "text": "(1949)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 582, "end": 588, "text": "(1950)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 589, "end": 595, "text": "(1951)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 903, "end": 918, "text": "(Comstock 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 919, "end": 931, "text": "Bryder 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Fear, however, like all emotions, is a subjective and fickle feeling that may not (and indeed often does not) focus on the right target.

Nor is science the answer to all: how many of us would jump out of an airplane without a parachute, despite the fact that no randomised controlled trial has \"scientifically\" proven the protection conferred by parachutes when falling through space (Gordon et al 2003) !

And yet if one considers the World Heath Organisation (WHO) European objectives regarding vaccine-preventable diseases, even a country like Switzerland has reached only three goals out of eight (see Table 1 ).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 548, "end": 555, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Research has shown for instance that 4 months after 11 September 2001 over 65% of Canadian adults would have readily agreed to be immunised against anthrax and more than 50% against smallpox, regardless of the fact that their exposure to such diseases was nil. In contrast, only a little over 37% would have agreed to be vaccinated against HIV (Ritvo et al 2003) , probably because they considered themselves as not exposed and/or because of treatments being available (regardless of their severe side effects, often underestimated or unknown to the larger public), HIV Aids is increasingly regarded as a chronic, non-fatal disease. Another variation on this theme can be seen in France where parents whose children were vaccinated against hepatitis B virus (HBV) during the 1994-1998 campaign as well as parents whose children were over 18 years of age in 2003 had a more favourable attitude towards the HBV vaccine than other parents. This can be attributed at least in part to the fact that they were not confronted with the dilemma of vaccinating or not their offspring following a nationwide scare that HBV vaccine caused multiple sclerosis and a variety of autoimmune diseases (Balinska and L\u00e9on 2007) . This again shows just how fickle fear is. In addition, our memory is short: need we remind ourselves that fear of bioterrorism (anthrax, smallpox...) following \"9/11\" was soon replaced by fear of SARS in 2003 and of pandemic influenza in 2005.

As a result, Hib incidence was brought down by 80% in less than 3 years (M\u00fchlemann et al. 1996) . But the same fear is associated with meningococcal C disease, whereas its extremely low incidence (only 0.5/ 100,000) hardly justifies the introduction of a full-fledged vaccination programme. Yet how can we not develop recommendations for this much demanded vaccine and how can a physician refuse its administration to the child of anxious parents, especially if the main reason is that the vaccine is \"too expensive\"?

Although rotavirus constitutes an important disease burden throughout the world (with high mortality in developing countries), the actual number of ensuing deaths is negligible in privileged countries where access to medical care is as rapid as in Switzerland. (Gabutti et al. 2007 ). It goes without saying that decisions based on fear are not always wise. In spring 2003, an outbreak of measles in Switzerland resulted in 671 cases, leading to 15% of complications, including 4 cases of encephalitis. In 2007, more than 1,000 measles cases were again reported in an outbreak that lasted for more than a year (Richard and Spicher 2007) and is still ongoing with more than 2,300 reported cases by March 2008. Switzerland is hardly an exception: measles outbreaks have been reported in the Netherlands (1999-2000, 3,292 reported cases in which 94% of the patients had not been vaccinated) ( Van den Hof et al 2002 ), in Campania, southern Italy, (2002 , some 20,000 cases with more than 5,000 associated hospitalisations) (Filia 2007) , France (2003, 89 cases in Marseilles with a shift to older persons) (Zandotti et al. 2004), and Germany (2003: 246 reported cases in the western part of the country with 52 hospitalisations) (Eurosurveillance Editorial Team 2006) . Reasons for insufficient coverage may range from fear of adverse events (such as in the UK) to problems of accessibility (such as in southern Italy) or to a preference for \"natural\" medicine (the Netherlands, northeastern Switzerland, and southeastern France). And once again, we face not only an epidemiological problem, but an ethical dilemma, for as one author rightly put it: \"unvaccinated clusters pose a risk to themselves and to surrounding vaccine-accepting individuals\" (Van den Hof et al 2002).

This means groups of individuals at greater risk of complications owing to their age or underlying conditions (immunodeficiency, certain chronic diseases, etc.) and consequently more likely to develop complications due, for example, to influenza. But there are also groups who are more exposed to diseases than others: for example, health-care workers (here again one can cite the examples of hepatitis B and influenza viruses), occupational risks (teachers, social workers, and tuberculosis), or people travelling from a specific diseasefree country to a country where that disease is prevalent (for example, yellow fever).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The need for evidence-based public health decisions"}, {"text": "Finally, in the third scenario, the individual benefit is greater or equal to the public health benefit. Such a scenario concerns severe diseases with low incidence (for example, meningococcal C disease), less severe diseases in that they very rarely cause permanent sequelae but occur at a high incidence in individuals without defined or controllable risk factors (for example, rotavirus gastroenteritis), and less severe diseases lacking alternative methods of prevention and/or treatment (for example, varicella in young children). This third scenario raises important ethical issues: if no official recommendations exist for these vaccines, parents will have at best partial information and, more likely, none. It follows that all effective and safe vaccines should benefit from specific evidence-based recommendations in order to ensure the right to information even in the absence of public health benefit -and even if the recommendation is that a vaccine is not \"worth\" administering to every one. Efforts should equally be made to ensure equitable access to prevention (principally through reimbursement schemes). However, simply to add such vaccines to routinely recommended vaccines that confer both public health and individual benefit carries the risk of seeing parents select vaccines based on the perceived risks of disease.
