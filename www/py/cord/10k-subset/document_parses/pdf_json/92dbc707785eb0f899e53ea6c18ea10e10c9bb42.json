Clinical changes were assessed every 2-3 weeks by the 21-item Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAMD) (total, single, and combined scores). BDV-1 activity was determined accordingly in blood plasma by enzyme immune assays for antigens (PAG), antibodies (AB) and circulating immune complexes (CIC). Results: Primary outcomes (\u226525% HAMD reduction, week 7) were 81.3% amantadine vs. 35.3% placebo responder (p = 0.003), a large clinical effect size (ES; Cohen's d) of 1.046, and excellent drug tolerance. Amantadine was safe reducing suicidal behaviour in the first 2 weeks. Pre-treatment maximum infection levels were predictive of clinical improvement (AB, p = 0.001; PAG, p = 0.026; HAMD week 7). Respective PAG and CIC levels correlated with AB reduction (p = 0,001 and p = 0.034, respectively). Follow-up benefits (12 months) correlated with dropped cumulative infection measures over time (p < 0.001). In vitro, amantadine concentrations as low as 2.4-10 ng/mL (50% infection-inhibitory dose) prevented infection with human BDV Hu-H1, while closely related memantine failed up to 100,000-fold higher concentration (200 \u03bcg/mL).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Bornaviruses are unique in that they are evolutionary ancient non-segmented negative-strand ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses (order Mononegavirales; family Bornaviridae) with nuclear replication [9] , covering a host spectrum from reptiles to mammals (> 25% genetic divergence).

Two provocative hypotheses contested since two decades were combined, namely whether depression could be linked to infection with a putatively moodmodulating virus (BDV-1) [14] [15] [16] [17] , and whether antiviral capacity of a well-known drug (amantadine) with yet ambiguous modes of action [5] could work as safe and well-tolerated antidepressant in infected patients. Testing an infectious contribution of BDV-1 to mental health, particularly depression, meant to be on a rocky path from the start, because human infection was doubted [25] , despite evidence at different levels [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] .

This could be addressed in future studies using other antivirals with known anti-BDV-1 but lacking antidepressant effects, such as the nucleoside analogues ribavirin and favipiravir (T-705). Early ribavirin in vitro studies had used human OL cells and rat glia cells (C6) persistently infected with laboratory strains V and He/80, respectively. They found a > 90% titre decline in both cell/virus systems within 3 days, applying 20 \u03bcM ribavirin up to 13 days, but a rapid virus recovery within 2 days after drug removal [70] . Recently, favipiravir, a new potent antiviral drug against a wide spectrum of viruses, was shown to be more effective than ribavirin against BDV-1. Favipiravir rapidly reduced BDV-1 infection at 200-400 \u03bcM to almost undetectable levels by 21 days using a recombinant virus system in Vero cells, and natural virus in OL cells persistently infected with He/80 at 400 \u03bcM by 28 days [71] . Equivalent in vivo plasma levels of favipiravir (446 \u03bcM; 70 \u03bcg/mL) have been successfully applied in a lethal non-human primate model against Ebola virus disease, reducing the median viral load at day 7 by 2-3 logs [72] . In contrast to amantadine, however, the clinical application of both these drugs is associated with the risk of significant adverse effects.

Alike amantadine, memantine came into focus as low affinity non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist with neuroprotective activity, but failed to show antidepressant effects in double-blind placebo-controlled RCTs [73, 74] . Here, we could show in vitro that amantadine was able to prevent infection (ID 50 ) of rabbit cells with human BDV strain Hu-H1 [20] at concentrations as low as 2.4 to 10 ng/mL (0.005 to 0.025 \u03bcM), while memantine failed up to a 100,000 fold higher concentration (200 \u03bcg/mL; 500 \u03bcM). Interestingly, the in vitro medium dose of amantadine which abrogated replication of the same human strain by 4 weeks (0.4 \u03bcg/mL; 1 \u03bcM), corresponded exactly to the in vivo blood level achieved through the dose of 200 mg amantadine orally daily applied in patients of our trial. In contrast, laboratory-adapted str. V [14] was insensitive to amantadine treatment up to the highest dose of 1.2 \u03bcg/ mL (3 \u03bcM), consistent with largely different biological properties of natural and non-natural strains [22, 23] . It should be noted that the remarkable insensitivity of BDV-1 laboratory strains observed earlier by different researchers [75] [76] [77] , had quite a while led to a general questioning of amantadine's anti-BDV efficacy. Here, we could finally dispel anybody's doubts by demonstrating the fundamental differences between a natural human isolate and a highly adapted laboratory strain in parallel in vitro experiments.

It therefore appears plausible that amantadine's contrasting bipartite capacity may be part of a common chief mode of action, unrelated to that of memantine. Notably, experimental animal evidence suggested a key impact of BDV-1 infection on the glutamate system, targeting non-NMDA receptors of the kainate-type (KARs), specifically KA1 [78] . KARs were thought to be involved in neuronal plasticity, indispensable for memory functioning and learning [79, 80] .
