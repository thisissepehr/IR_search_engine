Functional prediction analysis showed that the differentially expressed mRNAs were enriched in angiogenesis-related processes, which were highly correlated with miR-21a-3p. Culture medium from TCs with miR-21a-3p inhibition failed to promote angiogenesis in mouse models of LPS-induced ARDS. In cultured TCs, LPS stimulation upregulated the expression of miR-21a-3p, which further targeted the transcription factor E2F8 and decreased Notch2 protein expression. TCs culture medium enhanced hemangioendothelioma endothelial cells (EOMA cells) proliferation, which was blocked by the miR-21a-3p inhibitor. The PI3K p110\u03b1 inhibitor decreased vascular endothelial growth factor levels in LPS-stimulated TCs and reversed the enhancing effect of TCs culture medium on EOMA cells proliferation.",

According to an international multicentre research, the prevalence of ARDS was 10.4% of ICU admissions [1] . Inflammatory responses destroy underlying vascular endothelial cells and respiratory epithelial cells and impair the lungs' ability to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide [2] . Therefore, decreasing inflammation and accelerating blood vessel repair are two key factors in the prevention and treatment of ARDS. Since its severity and lack of effective pharmacologic treatments [3] , it is of great significance to explore novel therapeutic strategies for ARDS. Recently, cell therapy have been shown to have promising therapeutic potential. Mesenchymal stem cells ameliorated ARDS due to paracrine mechanism [4] .",

The catalytic subunits bind to p85 regulatory subunits, activate receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), and transmit a variety of cell surface receptor signals, such as those from the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), to promote cell growth [12] . The PI3K subunits p110\u03b1 and p110\u03b4 were demonstrated to be associated with tissue repair; however, this function is mediated by different mechanisms. The activity of PI3K p110\u03b1 can be enhanced by tyrosine kinase ligands, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) A, and can induce angiogenesis and vascular remodelling [13] . Moreover, p110\u03b1 regulates endothelial cell migration through the small GTPase RhoA, mediated by PI3KCG, a gene encoding a p110\u03b3 subunit, which has a protective effect on hypoxic-reoxygenated cardiomyocytes mediated by activation of the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway and inhibition of apoptosis [14] . PI3K (p110\u03b4)/ AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway mediates interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) induced airway epithelial cell growth and proliferation through interaction with CEACAM1 [15] .",

Bioinformatics approaches were applied to analyse gene expression profiles in TCs challenged with LPS. Particular attention was devoted to the angiogenesis-related process. The protective mechanisms mediated by the PI3K subunit in TCs were further examined in hemangioendothelioma endothelial cells (EOMA cells) in vitro. The current study presents the theoretical bases of an alternative new potential therapeutic strategy for ARDS.",

For further analysis, the DEGs were enriched in the STRING database. According to the STRING database, the DEGs were enriched in 9 angiogenesis-related processes: angiogenesis, blood vessel morphogenesis, vasculature development, blood vessel remodelling, sprouting angiogenesis, venous blood vessel sprouting, venous blood vessel morphogenesis, regulation of angiogenesis, and positive regulation of angiogenesis (Fig. 3d) . As most genes participated in at least 3 biological processes, those involved in more than three processes-i.e. E2F8, Notch1, EPAS1, Rbpj, Flt1, ACVRL1, EFNB2 and Thbs1-were selected for further research.

Given that miRNAs usually negatively regulate downstream genes, E2F8, EFNB2, and EPAS1 were further studied. LPS stimulation significantly increased miR-21a-3p and miR-221-5p expression in TCs compared with that in cells under control conditions. To clarify the relationship between miRNAs and mRNAs, miRNA inhibitors were applied. MiR-221-5p inhibition restored the expression of EPAS1 but not EFNB2, and miR-21a-3p inhibition restored the expression of E2F8 but not EPAS1. MiR-21 had been reported to increase proliferation, migration and tube formation of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) and induce angiogenesis by directly targeting PTEN [30, 31] . Moreover, miR-21a-3p and its downstream target E2F8 were further studied. After 24 h, the protein expression of E2F8 was decreased in TCs challenged with LPS and was restored by inhibition of miR-21a-3p.

MiR-221-5p [38] , miR-146a-5p [39] , and miR-21a-3p [40] [41] [42] are reported to be associated with the angiogenesis process. MiR-21a-3p and miR-221-5p were demonstrated to be involved in the promotion of angiogenesis in TCs. As miR-21a-3p was more frequently reported on angiogenesis, it was further studied. MiR-21a-3p knockdown Fig. 7 MiR-21a-3p and p110\u03b1 mediated the promotion of TCs on EOMA proliferation induced by LPS. a Cells proliferation rate of EOMA treated with LPS and/or TCs and miR-21a-3p inhibitor measured by CCK8 assay. *P < 0.05 vs Control, # P < 0.05 vs LPS/TC. b, d Cell proliferation of EOMA treated with LPS and/or TCs and miR-21a-3p inhibitor or p110\u03b1 inhibitor measured by Cell-IQ. *P < 0.05 vs Control, # P < 0.05 vs LPS, **P < 0.05 vs LPS/ TC, n = 6. c, e Cell movement of EOMA treated with LPS and/or TCs and miR-21a-3p inhibitor or p110\u03b1 inhibitor measured by Cell-IQ. f VEGFA levels secreted by TCs treated with LPS and/or miR-21a-3p inhibitor or p110\u03b1 inhibitor measured by ELISA. *P < 0.05 vs Control, # P < 0.05 vs LPS, n = 6 17:427 in TCs reduced CD31 and eNOS expression in the lungs of ARDS mice in vivo. MiR-21a-3p exerts its protective effects on injury repair by inducing angiogenesis-associated signalling pathways. For instance, miR-21a-3p activates the AKT pathway and increases matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expression to reduce the extent of the infarcted region in heart ischaemia/reperfusion injury [41] , inhibits PTEN and sprouty homolog 1 (SPRY1) to heal soft tissue wounds [40] , and upregulates VEGF and activates the Ang-1/Tie-2 axis in traumatic brain injury [42] . In the current study, the p110\u03b1 isoform in PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway was demonstrated to be involved in miR-21a-3p-mediated angiogenic factor induction in TCs. However, the alteration of other protein levels and HIF-1\u03b1 in TCs treated with LPS and the miR-21a-3p inhibitor indicated that more complex signalling pathways were involved in regulating the angiogenic function of TCs. Culture medium from LPS-induced TCs promoted EOMA cells proliferation in vitro, accompanied by elevated levels of VEGF mRNA and secretion, which further demonstrated that the functional miR-21a-3p was generated by TCs. These data support the hypothesis that miR-21a-3p plays a role in angiogenesis and profoundly demonstrate the mechanisms mediated by PI3K p110\u03b1. The E2F family was first reported to induce cell proliferation [43] , and E2F family members are essential transcriptional regulators of cell cycle progression [44] , as well as apoptosis, metabolism and angiogenesis [45] . E2F8 is an atypical transcriptional repressor in the E2F family since it contains domains that differ from the canonical domains [46] . By forming homodimers or heterodimers with E2F7, E2F8 reduces the excessive and destructive activation of E2F1 [47] . However, reports of E2F8 in angiogenesis in the literature are controversial. E2F7/8 has been reported to positively regulate the formation of blood vessels during embryonic development via HIF-1\u03b1/VEGFA signalling [33] . On the other hand, E2F7/8 suppresses tumour angiogenesis via the induction of DLL4 [32] . In the present study, E2F8 expression was reduced after LPS stimulation in TCs and restored with miR-21a-3p inhibition, indicating that E2F8 plays a negative role in angiogenesis under inflammatory conditions. The Notch family, which contains several receptors and ligands, is fundamental in the regulation of blood vessel branching [48] . DLL4, a Notch ligand, has an inhibitory function in blood vessel branching [49] that is compromised by Jagged 1 activation [50] . Notch1 positively regulates angiogenesis [51] , while Notch2 negatively regulates cell proliferation [52] and angiogenesis [53] . In the initial stage of angiogenesis, inhibition of Notch 2 promotes vascular endothelial cell proliferation, while activation of Notch 2 reduces endothelial cell responses to VEGF [54, 55] . In the present study, Notch2 expression was mediated by miR-21a-3p. However, the relationship between the transcription factor E2F8 and Notch2 was not illustrated. Further experiments should be conducted to confirm the signalling pathway of E2F8/Notch2 in angiogenesis. ",

Via mouse models, bioinformatics approaches and molecular biological methods, the present study shows that activated TCs promote endothelial regeneration and angiogenesis through miR-21a-3p-PI3K (p110\u03b1)/AKT/mTOR signalling and further demonstrates the key roles of VEGF in TCs. The E2F8/Notch2 signalling might also participates in this process. These findings shed light on miR-21a-3p in TCs as a new therapeutic target for vessel protection.",
