Conclusion: When performing the molecular detection of HPV DNA, it is essential that the diagnostic procedures employed are highly sensitive, specific and reliable. Because of the limited availability of antibodies against specific types of HPV or the low applicability in clinical routine and because HPV positive OSCCs are characterized by CDKN2a overexpression, p16 was considered a surrogate marker of HPV infection. It is well known that p16 is the most imbalanced tumor suppressor in oral carcinogenesis (deletion, promoter methylation, allelic imbalance and loss of heterozygosity). Two subgroups of OSCCs may be identified. The big one (89.5%) showed negative or low level of p16 expression, corresponding to HPV negative cases and with epigenetic or genetic suppression of gene expression. The second group (10.5%) is characterized by p16 overexpression ([50%) and HPV infection. This study also demonstrated that an epigenetic mechanism was associated to tobacco/alcohol consumption.

The aim of the retrospective study was to evaluate the data from patients older than 70 years who suffered from head and neck cancer. Patients and materials: From 376 patients suffering from head and neck cancer that were treated between 1999 and 2008, 103 (27.4%) were older than 70 years and were evaluated retrospectively. Results: The male-female ratio was 50:53, mean age 70 years . From 95 patients with a squamous cell carcinoma, four patients had a verrucous form. Five patients revealed a malignoma of the small salivary glands, two patients a malignant melanoma and one metastasis of a prostate carcinoma. Special attention was paid to comorbidities and therapy strategies. Conclusion: Decisions in cancer therapy for elderly patients are challenging. Patients suffering from operable head and neck cancer should be treated with curative intend with regard to quality of life, if a careful assessment of co-morbidities is performed preoperatively. Introduction: The prolongation of life expectancy results in an increasing number of malignant neoplasms occurring in the elderly population.

In this retrospective study, effect of age on survival and locoregional control (LRC) will be studied among patients treated by CRT or radiotherapy. Methods: All advanced stages treated by CRT from 1999 CRT from to 2007 or by XRT from 1989 XRT from to 1999 pts [70 years old) were included. Chemotherapy was either DPP 100 mg/m 2 X3 or weekly DDP 40 mg/m 2 . Results: Survival was lower if [70 YO: hazard ratio (HR) for [70/ B70 YO were: 2.25, p = 0.0003 and 1.5, p = 0.03 for CRT and XRT. For pts [ 70 YO, 3-year survival was 57 and 27%, p = 0.005 and 3-year LRC was 82 and 42%, p \\ 0.01 for CRT and XRT. Among pts [ 70 years treated by CRT, survival and LCR were idem for patients treated by DDP 100 or 40 mg/m 2 although early deaths were a bit higher with DDP 100 mg, p = 0.1. For pts treated by CRT, hospitalization rates were 47 and 50% for pts \\70 and C70 YO. Only KPS \\ 80 was prognostic for survival in pts [ 70 YO treated by CRT. Conclusions: Effect of age was stronger for patients treated by CRT, indicating that this is a more lethal treatment than XRT in pts 70 YO. Despite of that, survival and LCR remain much better with CRT than XRT. CRT should be considered in older pts with KPS C 80. Introduction: There is a debate in the literature in the approach to manage cancer in the elderly. Although age has not been found to be an independent negative prognostic factor in head and neck cancer patients, morbidity and mortality are increased with the higher incidence of co-morbidity. Purpose: (1) To determine the complication rate of different treatment modalities in elderly laryngeal cancer patients. (2) To explore relation between severity of pre-treatment co-morbidities and post-treatment complications in elderly laryngeal cancer patients. Materials: Patients 75 years old or older (elderly group; n = 139) at the time of diagnosis with laryngeal cancer were diagnosed in our department between 1998 and 2008. Patients under 65 with the diagnosis of laryngeal cancer diagnosed in our department as a control group (n = 289). Methods: Retrospective, case-controlled medical chart analysis. Pretreatment co-morbidity (ACE-27), initial staging, tumor localization, treatment intention and modality, recurrence, post-treatment complications data have been analyzed. Results: There is no correlation between age and complication rate. Significant difference has been found in the incidence of co-morbidities according to age. The higher the incidence of co-morbidity is, the higher the chance of treatment-related complications. Endolaryngeal laser treatment has the lowest and radiotherapy has the highest complication rate in both groups (no significant difference according to age). The severity and rate of complications after a total laryngectomy are significantly more in the elderly group. Conclusions: Elderly laryngeal cancer patients should be treated according to protocols as other patients, although careful pretreatment evaluation is essential because of the higher incidence of co-morbidities in this patient group. Introduction: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is primarily disease of older men with a long history of tobacco and/or alcohol use. Uncommonly, similar tumors affect young adults, with age from 18 to 45 years, with different features and debatable behavior. Purpose: This study aimed to review the profile of young patients with a diagnosis of OSCC in National Cancer Institute from 2001 to 2004 and to evaluate clinicopathological factors. Materials and methods: The sample was selected from the files of the hospital and clinicopathological informations of each case were obtained from medical records and tumor registries. In this study were included only patients aged between 18 and 45 years, with SCC of tongue and/or floor of mouth, which treatment had been surgery and had performed neck dissection. SPSS statistical program was used for the analysis. Differences were considered significant for p value B0.05. Results: Decades of life were statistically associated with sex (p = 0.012), with history of tobacco and alcohol (p = 0.011) and treatment (p = 0.037). Recurrence and lymph nodes involvement showed a significant association with overall survival (p = 0.0005 and 0.032). Conclusion: The OSCC in young patients with B40 years showed different clinicopathological features to compare with patients [40 years, like significant number of women affected, and a little influence of tobacco-alcohol use as etiologic factors.

So, there has been a suggestion that it has different clinical characteristics and disease progression from that of old group. Purpose: The aim of this study was to analyze clinical characteristics of tongue cancer in this group, and to compare with that of old group. Materials and methods: A retrospective review was made of 85 patients who diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma of oral tongue, and divided into two age groups, over 45 years of age and under 45 years. The following data were recorded from the patients file: age, sex, tobacco and alcohol consumption, staging, pathology, treatment modality, hospital day, and clinical outcome. To compare the prognosis of similar staged patients in both group, each age group was divided into early (stages I and II) and advanced stage group (stages III and IV), and compared individually. Results: There were 23 patients in the young age group, and 62 patients in the old age group. According to early stage group, clinical prognosis of patients in both the age groups was good, and there was no significant difference. But, according to advanced stage group, the recurrence rate was 47.8% in young age group and 25.8% in old age group. It was significantly higher in young age group (p = 0.019*). The disease-specific survival rate of patients in young age group was significantly lower than that of patients in old age group (p = 0.025*).

The chance, given from microsurgery, for wide and complex reconstruction enlarged oncological guidelines for more wide resections. Before making reconstructive planning consideration about patient's clinical conditions and his age most be made. Purpose: The paper's purpose is to present authors' clinical series of young and old oncological patients who underwent maxillary reconstruction after malignancy ablation. Materials: More than 10 years experience of Maxillo-facial Surgery Department of Rome is presented; clinical data of the patients and surgical procedures are presented. Methods: Authors present their experience in maxillary reconstruction on oncological patients. They deal with reconstructive problems and different reconstructive techniques. In particular, they focus attention on matters concerning relationships between patients' age and reconstructive options. Discussion: Resection of maxillary malignancy can give considerable aesthetic and functional problems. Clinical assessment of these patients can show altered occlusion; difficulty in chewing, speaking, swallowing; labial incompetence; and drooling associated with aesthetic impairment. Surgeon's goals are aesthetic recovery (support of the nasal pyramid, lips, cheek, orbital cavity, and restoration of the projection of middle thirds of the face) and functional rehabilitation (labial competence, chewing, speaking, swallowing, and breathing). Conclusions: We believe that before reconstructive considerations, one must carefully evaluate some other important factors such as: patient age, local and general conditions of the patient: previous radiotherapic treatments, dysmetabolic pathologies, systemic vascular pathologies and compliance.

The oral cavity can also be affected by salivary gland tumours (SGT) that respond poorly to radio-and chemotherapy and similarly lack distinctive markers. Purpose: The study aims at exploiting a multidisciplinary approach that combines retrospective and prospective analyses to identify molecular markers predicting the clinical behaviour of OSCC and SGT. In particular, the project attempts to disclose prognostic markers capable of defining the clinical course of three discrete classes of patients: those with early stage T1-T2 OSCC with unexpected aggressive behaviour; young patients (\\40 years) affected by OSCC and lacking overt risk factors; and patients affected by metastatic SGT. Methods: In selected primary and metastatic lesions of OSCC, we examined, at both mRNA and protein level, the expression pattern of an apparently OSCC-enriched p63 variant and the 12 currently known cell surface-associated proteoglycans (NG2, syndecans-1-4 and glypicans-1-6). We evaluated these previously identified putative biomarkers both qualitatively and quantitatively and correlate their expression patterns with the clinical course of the patients. In parallel, we performed whole-genome comparative genetic screenings on primary lesions from metastatic and non-metastatic patients and secondary lesions of post-surgical patients. Both intact tumour samples and laser microdissected specimens were examined. These experimental approaches have been combined with hierarchical agglomerative clustering of previously identified gene markers through current bioinformatic algorithms and dedicated software tools. Results: We foresee to reveal novel prognostic markers capable of predicting the unfavourable clinical course of early stage (T1-T2) OSCC patients, young (\\40 years) OSCC patients lacking risk factors and individuals developing SGT.

As such there is a paucity of information about its incidence, presentation, management and treatment outcomes. A systematic review and analysis of all reported cases have been carried out. Purpose: To review and evaluate the literature and to perform a metaanalysis on all pharyngeal pouch carcinoma cases published in the English literature over the last 112 years. Materials and methods: A comprehensive literature search for pharyngeal pouch carcinoma was performed on PUBMED/MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Science Citation Index from 1896 to 2008. The keywords used were pharyngeal pouch carcinoma, Zenker's diverticulum carcinoma, hypopharyngeal pouch carcinoma and oesophageal pouch carcinoma. The citations from the selected articles were cross-referenced and relevant publications (including the first pharyngeal pouch carcinoma case reported by Pitt GN, in 1886) were added to the final review and meta-analysis. Articles published in languages other than English were excluded. Results: Forty-one articles reporting 60 cases satisfied the inclusion criteria. Their findings were tabulated, analysed and evaluated for survival rates depending on treatment modality, duration of pouch/ symptoms and age at the presentation. The mean age at presentation was 68.8 years (SD 9.8) with M:F ratio of 3.8:1. The mean duration of symptoms was 12 years (SD 9.8), with duration [10 years confounding poor outcome. Thirty-one patients underwent excision alone, 9 excisions with post-operative radiotherapy (PORT) and 11 radiotherapy alone, while 7 patients did not receive any treatment for carcinoma. Excision alone gave the best outcomes with 1-, 3-and 5-zyear survival rates of 64, 39 and 18%, respectively.

Even in multimodality treatment current clinical trials face dramatically increasing early and late toxicities, which require more robust pre-treatment criteria to select responders. Materials and methods: For HNSCC, assay-based individual testing is hindered by a series of technical problems and principal questions like micro-heterogeneity, flavin-induced cell toxicity, lack of differentiation between tumor and stromal cells, differences in chemosensitivity of tumor and stromal cells, structural needs for specific handling of the testing, lack of specific dose-related sensitivity towards single and combined substances etc. To address this needs, we developed the ''short-time ex vivo colony-forming assay-flavin-protecting conditions'' (FLAVINO-Assay) in last 15 years which is now evaluated for clinical research.

Purpose: The aim of the study is to determine the safety, effectiveness, and burden of bleomycin-EPT for patients with head-neck or skin cancer. Materials and methods: A total of 24 tumors in 14 patients with head and neck mucosa (n = 6) or skin (n = 8) cancer, which could no longer be treated by surgery or radiotherapy, or for which conventional treatment would be very extensive, were treated by bleomycin-EPT.

All 24 tumors have responded to treatment. Three out of 24 tumors showed residual disease within 6 months. Two patients died with local control before 6 months. One patient was tube feeding dependent after treatment and one other patient had a carotid blow out due to wound healing problems. In all other cases functions were preserved successfully.

This disadvantage is caused by the application-to-tumor-dose-ratio due to the insufficient drug dose in the respective tumor region. Purpose: With magnetic drug targeting (MDT), chemotherapeutic agents bound to magnetic nanoparticles can be directed to desired body compartments using an external magnetic field. Materials and methods: Superparamagnetic Fe 3 O 4 -nanoparticles (diameter 11 nm) bound to the antineoplastic agent mitoxantrone were injected into the tumor supplying vascular system in rabbits focused by an external magnetic field. The biodistribution of the nanoparticles and mitoxantrone was detected by histology, chromatography, radiology and the alteration of the tumor morphology was observed by individual measurement of the tumor and by imaging methods (DYNA-CT, MRI). Results: All methods described above evidenced enrichment of the drug-loaded nanoparticles in the defined tumor region. The outcome of the therapy could be documented due to the complete tumor reduction and the imaging methods. This could be achieved with only 10% of the regular systemic mitoxantrone dose and negative side effects have not been detected, so far.

Methods: The antigen peptides of Tca8113 cells were obtained by acid eluted technique and repetitive freeze thaw method, separating T cell and inducing dendritic cells from human peripheral blood monocyte. It is divided into three groups: weak acid elution method antigen group, anti-freeze-thaw method antigen group, the control group (without tumor antigen). T cells and DCs were mixed by different effector-target ratio. Using MTT assay, the quantities of absorbance were measured and stimulation index was calculated. Dendritic cells pulsed with antigen was mixed with T cells by different effector-target ratio. Using MTT assay the quantities of absorbance were measured and killing rate was calculated, and compared among three groups. Results: DCs vaccine was constructed successfully. DCs vaccine can induce T lymphocytes to kill Tca8113 cells and displayed the doseeffect relationship. There was significant difference among the three groups. The acid eluted and repetitive freeze thaw groups were superior than the control group; The acid eluted group is better than repetitive freeze thaw group. Conclusion: DCs vaccine can induce T lymphocytes to kill Tca8113 cells. The antigen peptides obtained by acid eluted technique is better than repetitive freeze thaw method in immunotherapy of tongue cancer. Conclusions: This is the first examination of MTBP expression in human tissues and provides evidence for a p53-dependent role for MTBP in suppressing disease progression. Combining this with in vitro data demonstrating that MTBP suppresses cell motility suggests that loss of MTBP leads to increased cell motility (a major determinant of metastatic potential) and may provide a link between the observed loss of MTBP expression and lower survival. MTBP has potential for both prognostication and may also provide a novel therapeutic opportunity. Conclusions: These data are invaluable for anyone using CO 2 lasers in this setting.

Metastatic retropharyngeal nodes may occur in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) and in well-differentiated thyroid cancer. Surgical management of disease in this location can be problematic due to the proximity of the internal carotid and jugular vessels. Traditional extirpative procedure to retropharyngeal nodes involves a transcervical approach. In HNSC it can be performed by a superior extension of neck dissection. However, in well-differentiated thyroid cancer a transcervical approach would add considerable morbidity. Here, we discuss here two cases of metastatic retropharyngeal nodes, one from a recurrent oro-pharynx carcinoma and one from a well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma. The latest was managed by a transoral approach using an ultrasound lead in the operation room. Our approach required an incision in the soft palate to facilitate the exposition field. The nodes were removed easily within 30 min. The patient was allowed to eat a mixed diet the day after surgery. The patient with recurrent oropharyngeal carcinoma after radiation therapy had local as well as regional recurrences. Transcervical approach with mandibulotomy was performed, giving exposition to allow control of internal carotid, which proved to be mandatory to remove the adherent node. The patient return to a normal diet after day 15, this delay was ascribable to the removal of the primitive tumour. The technical choice remains patient's dependant and must be carefully examined before surgery, in all case with preoperative MRI.

We supposed that different positive resection sites could demonstrate variant risk of local recurrence and treatment failure. Thus, it could be worthy to concern about anatomical differences of positive resection margin, which possibly related to overall outcomes of tongue cancer patients. Materials and methods: Eventually, five anatomic locations of surgical margin were classified, such as four superficial surface margins (anterior, posterior, medial, and lateral) and deep soft tissue margin. Of 265 patients with tongue cancer, 39 patients with positive margin or distance of free margin less than 3 mm were reviewed. Among them, 20 patients (51.3%) were found superficial margins involved and 19 patients (48.7%) showed deep surgical margin involved. Result: There was significant worse impact to 5-year overall survival rate on patients who was cut margins involved compared to patients with margin free (46 vs. 69%, P = 0.0002). However, it was no difference between anatomic locations of positive margin in survival rate and risk of local recurrence (local recurrence rate was 69.2 and 61.5%). Average survival duration in patients with those two groups was 3.07 and 2.62 years. Conclusion: Surgical positive margin has been shown to be one of the most important factor in treatment outcomes, whether involved superficially or deep soft margin. Among two groups of patient, local recurrence was the common cause of treatment failure. Introduction: In tumours of oral tongue and floor of mouth (FOM), the incidence of occult cervical metastasis is relatively high. This is the most important prognostic factor, which can lead to a reduction in the probability of disease control. No evidence-based data about the management of the neck in these early disease stages exist. Objectives: Comparison of results of observation and elective neck dissection (END) in stages I and II disease of oral tongue and FOM. Calculation of recurrence and survival rates of these different treatment modalities. Materials and methods: A retrospective review on patients treated in our service with a SCC of FOM or oral tongue between 1988 and 2008 was carried out. Clinical data included location and dimensions of tumour, nodal status, staging, treatment, tumour recurrence and metastasis. Disease-free interval (DFI), overall (OS) and diseasespecific (DSS) survival rates were calculated. Results: 84 patients with early stage SCC were treated in our department. 61 patients with complete files were included in this review. Small tumours (T1) were usually treated without END, while patients with larger tumours (T2) usually received an END. Only 3 patients (9%) had an occult neck metastasis (N1). The 5-year DSS rate was 91% and the 5-year OS rate was 75%; the 5-year DFI was 77%. Conclusion: Because of the inhomogenous groups, no conclusion could be drawn regarding neck management. Elective neck dissection is an effective method of locoregional tumour control in early stage SCC, with good survival rates. Background: The objective of this study was to report the incidence of postoperative complications in primary surgery for oral cavity carcinoma in our centre and to correlate patient's systemic, tumour and surgical related factors in predicting the postoperative complications. Methods: A total of 6 patients who underwent primary surgical resection of oral cavity carcinoma, neck dissection with or without flap reconstruction treated between August and October 2009 were included in the study. We record both local and systemic postoperative complications during their hospital stay. Surgical procedures, patients and tumour characteristic were also recorded. Their correlations were analysed by univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: No mortality and flap loss was recorded. There were seven local and two systemic complications were recorded. Local complications of wound infection and dehiscence were the most common complications, occurred in 3 (50%) patients, followed by haematoma and fistula formation. Most common systemic complications included episodes of pneumonia and atelectasis. Increase hospital stays and patient with existing medical morbidity showed higher local and systemic postoperative complications. Types of neck dissection and extent of tumour and surgery, somewhat were not a predictive factor for local complications. Conclusion: The length of hospital stay and medical morbidity are correlated to postoperative complications. Types of neck dissection and extent of tumour and surgery were not predictive factors for local complications. Introduction: Selective neck dissection is generally accepted as an elective neck treatment method for the N0 patients. But, sometimes, conversion from selective neck dissection to comprehensive neck dissection is needed, especially when we find the suspicious neck node in the operative field. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare the therapeutic results between the selective neck dissection (SND) and the conversion comprehensive neck dissections (CCND) for the clinically N0 but pathologically N positive cases. Materials: We reviewed the medical records of 562 newly diagnosed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients from 2000 to 2008. Methods: We used Kaplan-Meyer's method to compare the therapeutic results between selective neck dissection group and conversion comprehensive neck dissection group. Results: Among 18 cases who got the selective neck dissection, 12 cases were NED (no evidence of disease) state. One case died with local recurrence and 3 cases were alive with lung metastasis. Two cases died with other cause. Among 10 cases who got the conversion comprehensive neck dissection, 7 cases were NED state and two cases died with local recurrence and lung metastasis, respectively. One case died with other cause. When we used Kaplan-Meyer's survival curve, there was no statistic significance between the selective neck dissection group and the conversion selective neck dissection group (p = 0.2886). Conclusion: In conclusion, even in clinically N0 but pathologically N positive cases, selective neck dissection had the same disease control rate as the conversion comprehensive neck dissection. Background: Management of head and neck cancer has evolved, with therapies becoming increasingly targeted and tailored, allowing preservation of function and cosmesis without impairing oncological effectiveness. We have retrospectively analyzed the prevalence and distribution of histologic cervical node metastases in hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma to determine the most appropriate form of neck dissection. Materials and methods: We have examined specimens from 83 patients in whom neck dissection was part of primary treatment of hypopharyngeal carcinoma. Thirteen patients were treated by unilateral or bilateral selective dissection of levels II-IV \u00b1 VI for N0 disease and 70 by comprehensive dissection for N+ disease.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PP004"}, {"text": "Assessment was by separation of the specimens into node levels at the time of surgery and embedding all the resected material for histologic analysis. Results: Nodal metastases were found in 53.8% of ipsilateral and 9.1% of contralateral dissections in the N0 cases. The corresponding prevalence in N+ cases was 91.4 and 30.6%. The majority of metastases in N0 and N1 disease were confined to levels II, III, and IV. Metastases to levels I (7.1%) and V (7.1%) were infrequent even in N+ disease. The tumors invading pyriform sinus apex (15.4 vs. 8.6%) and having multiple metastatic nodes (p = 0.001) had a higher likelihood of level VI metastases. Conclusions: Our results support the use of elective dissection of node levels II-IV for N0 hypopharyngeal carcinoma. We suggest the inclusion of level VI node for tumor invading pyriform sinus apex, and multiple lateral neck metastases. The prevalence of bilateral metastases was great in multiple nodal metastases, multi-subsite involvement, and postcricoid region. Background: Though the association between nodal status and survival in oral cavity carcinomas has been proposed, there are no studies which agree with this proposal. Objective: To determine, using institutional database of oral squamous cell carcinoma, whether nodal status impacts survival in node positive tumors. Results: 128 patients between 1996 and 2006 with N1 and N2 nodal status with oral squamous cell carcinoma were included in the study. The mean number of nodes identified was 39.2 and mean nodal ratio was 8%. Nodal ratio was strongly statistically associated with survival in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients could be stratified into low (0-6%), moderate (6-12%), and high risk ([12%) groups based on nodal ratio.

Materials and methods: Retrospective review of 28 patients treated with organ preservation therapy for locally advanced HNSCC that have undergone PND after CRT or RT, between September 2003 and to date. Data on the type of surgery, pre-operative and post-operative complications has been collected and analyzed. Results: 25 patients have undergone CRT and 3 RT. Two patients underwent selective ND, 22 patients had a modified radical ND, 2 had a radical ND and 2 extended RND. The mean time between ending CRT or RT and undergoing surgery was 42 days. Fourteen patients underwent PND via a MEHAI. Surgical complications were seen in 15 (53%) patients, being seroma the most common one. No tissue breakdown was observed in patients who underwent MEHAI as opposed to other incisions. Conclusions: Planned ND following chemo-radiation treatment for carcinoma of the upper aero-digestive tract is increasingly used but remains controversial for patients with a complete clinical response. PND is associated with significant morbidity and potential tissue breakdown. The use of a MEHAI allows adequate access to all levels of the neck and minimizes the risk tissue breakdown. Introduction: Nearly all types of neck dissections for head and neck cancers entail surgical removal of the submandibular gland. Tumor metastases to this gland are infrequent. Purpose: To assess the incidence and factors associated of secondary metastases to the submandibular salivary gland(s) in the patients undergoing neck dissections for head and neck cancers. To identify subgroup(s) of patients in whom this gland may be spared during neck dissections. Materials: A retrospective study was done to review the hospital records of 284 patients that underwent neck dissections for head and neck cancers excluding thyroid malignancies between September 2003 and August 2009. Methods: Clinicopathologic correlation between the primary tumor, nodal involvement and stage of the disease were studied with respect to the metastatic involvement of the submandibular gland. Standard statistical tests of significance were done using SPSS 11.0.1. p value of \\0.05 was considered significant. Results: Two hundred and eighty-four patients underwent 308 neck dissections. Submandibular salivary gland was found to contain metastatic tumor deposits in 13 (4.6%) of these patients. The association between the advanced stage and the involvement of the submandibular gland by the tumor was statistically significant (p = 0.001). The incidence of involvement of the submandibular gland by the tumor was significantly greater when level 1b nodes were clinically palpable or histopathologically found to harbor metastatic disease (p = 0.003; p \\ \\ \\, respectively). There was a significant correlation between clinically palpable and pathologically involved level 1b nodes (p \\\\ \\).

Skip metastases in neck nodes usually occur in tongue cancer but not common to carcinoma of the buccal mucosa. An attempt has been made to study this rare event in carcinoma of the buccal mucosa. Materials and methods: Though a total of 192 patients were treated for carcinoma of the buccal mucosa, only 52 patients were diagnosed to have skip metastases and were included in the study. Special attention was paid to treatment modalities and survival. Results: Of the 52 patients, 6 had bilateral nodes, which were found to be positive on FNAC. All the 52 patients underwent neck dissections. 32 require adjuvant therapy (chemoradiation). All patients have been followed up and remain symptom free till date. Conclusion: Carcinoma of buccal mucosa rarely spreads to bilateral cervical nodes and skip metastasizes but should be sought for when patient presents with bilateral neck nodes and skip metastases, as the approach to treatment changes drastically.

The biggest difficulty to create a microsurgical team in small medical centers is the absence of a surgeon with specific training, often a plastic surgeon. Purpose: To demonstrate the feasibility to do microsurgical reconstructions also by medical teams without a plastic surgeon or a surgeon with specific training, achieving good results comparable as that presented by traditional worldwide microsurgery departments. Materials: Are presented 15 patients undergone to head and neck oncologic resections, in a general hospital in a 5-month period. In all cases were used 3.5 magnifying glass during the anastomose, prolene 7.0 and/or nylon 8-0. Methods: Prospective analysis of tumor localization, the kind of free flap, the kind of anastomose, the surgical time, and complicacies. Patients who should be undergone to myocutaneous or fasciocutaneous flap reconstructions were studied with pre-operative Doppler. All free flaps were done by the H&N surgeon and all the microanastomoses were done by a vascular surgeon without previous microsurgery training. Results: Were done 7 lateral thigh flaps, 4 jejunal and 4 antebrachial flaps. There was only 1 total loss (antebrachial flap) reaching a 93.3% success rate. Conclusions: Our success rates are comparable with other reports. We believe that microsurgical reconstruction in head neck cancer can be done for inexperienced surgical teams with good results, given the opportunity to propagate this technique also to small medical centers. Introduction: Porcine dermal collagen has successfully been used as an alloplastic material in diverse surgical fields. Use of Permacol in the Head and Neck area surgery has a limited experience, since there are only a few reports in the literature and mainly for aesthetical reasons. Permacol is a strong biological, non-absorbable implant with natural properties that make it suitable for use in the maxillofacial region. Materials and methods: We describe our experience over a time period of 3 years, from 2006 to 2008, in a retrospective analysis of selective cases in which porcine dermal collagen had been used in the surgery of bisphosphonate-induced osteonecrosis of the jaws. Results: 26 patients with osteonecrosis of the jaws were surgically treated and necrotic bone was removed. Permacol was used with the hope that the alloplastic material would act as a barrier between bone and the overlying mucosa. Discussion: Permacol Surgical Implant (Tissue Science Laboratories, UK) is a sterile, off-white, moist, tough and flexible fibrous flat sheet of acellular porcine dermal collagen and its constituent elastin fibres. It is biocompatible and not allergenic. It is intended for permanent implantation in humans and is indicated for the reconstruction, recontouring and reformation of human soft connective tissue, particularly where loss of dermis has occurred, and as a supporting tissue in various surgical procedures. It is the first time that Permacol has been used in surgery of bisphosphonate-induced osteonecrosis of the jaws. All our patients had malignancies. Most of them had multiple myeloma (42.3%), followed by breast cancer (30.7%) and 27% of the patients had some other form of malignancy with bone metastasis, which were treated by bisphosphonates. In all patients that we intervened surgically, we observed no improvement in clinical signs with conservative treatment for more than 6 months preoperatively. In the last 4 years of use of this alloplastic material, we had the opportunity to have a follow up from 11 to 39 months (mean 26 months). In four patients, we observed a postoperative break down of the surgical trauma, but in 3 of them there was no bone exposure. Five patients underwent hyperbaric oxygen therapy mainly because of the size of the lesions. No allergic reaction, extrusion, migration or other potential complications for implants or alloplastic or heterologous materials were observed.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PP046"}, {"text": "Recurrent oral squamous cell carcinoma after resection and mandibular implant rehabilitation: a preliminary report of 8 cases", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PP048"}, {"text": "Clinic of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria Introduction: Restoration of function by dental implants following complete tumor removal has high priority in tumor surgery. Recurrent squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) after this procedure led us to search for possible causes. Methods: 16 patients with primary oral SCC had undergone resection, postop. radiotherapy, various reconstructive procedures and functional rehabilitation by endosseous mandibular implants. In 8 patients a recurrence was observed. The charts of these patients were examined for possible causal factors. Results: The primary SCC had always been located in the floor of the mouth and/or the mandibular alveolar process, and had been removed with sound margins. The time interval between primary resection and the placement of implants was 18-118 months (mean 43 months). The recurrent SCC occurred in a similar area 1-69 months (mean 34 months) after implantation. This area was again resected in 7 patients 23-95 months after the first resection (mean 65 months). Three patients died within 2-17 months (mean 7 months) due to tumor progression. One patient died after 4 months because of pulmonary embolism. The follow-up period of the other 4 patients (3 tumor-free, 1 alive with disease) was 6-38 months (mean 26 months). Discussion: In our opinion, the following factors may play a role: close resection margins with remaining epithelial dysplasia, field cancerization, chronic inflammation due to poor oral hygiene, passive smoking, loss of sensitivity in the mandible after continuity resection, clinical misinterpretation of SCC as ''granulation tissue'', HPV infection, etc. The low number of patients does not allow unequivocal conclusions. We recommend a small mucosal biopsy at the time of implant placement. Symptoms of periimplantitis in former tumor patients should be considered as a serious sign.

Method application PEG excludes development of these complications. PEG is carried out faster, than surgical gastrostoma, and does not demand deep anesthesia. Methods: In our clinic experience, more than 40 gastrostomies at patients with the oropharyngeal tumors of oncological treatment are stored. For 20 and 20 patients, surgical gastrostomy and PEG are performed, respectively. The PEG techniques consisted of following stages: (1) a choice of the best place of a puncture: after introduction, endoscope in a stomach and sufficient introduction air with the help of diaphanoscopical illumination, the suitable place for a puncture is defined. The control of correctness of a choice of a place of a puncture is made by means of pressing by a finger outside, thus endoscopically the place of this pressing is clearly visible; (2) a stomach puncture: after processing of the chosen place of a puncture and local anaesthesia the skin cut, width 4-5 mm is made.

It usually occurs in males after decades of exposure to smoking and alcohol abuse. The incidence of SCC of the oral cavity in adults less than 40 years of age ranges between 0.4 and 3.6%. Materials and methods: A 23-year-old man, presented with an exophytic lesion of the left lateral tongue, 2 9 2 cm in size, classified as T1, with a clinical and CT nodal status N0. The tumor extension was close to the midline, and for that reason a bilateral selective neck dissection was planned. The medical history of the patient was insignificant, but he mentioned smoking from the age of 12 years and the casual use of heroin. Biopsy confirmed the malignant nature of the lesion, Results: We performed an extensive resection of the squamous cell carcinoma with free margins of 1.5 cm, simultaneously performed bilateral selective neck dissection.

The patient was previously diagnosed with unilateral, left-sided nasal polyposis and sinusitis and received medical treatment without any improvement. The clinical evaluation revealed a mass originating from the left inferior turbinate obstructing the left nasal cavity and protruding from the nasal vestibule. No palpable cervical lymph nodes were identified. MRI of head and neck confirmed the presence of a solid mass in the left nasal cavity with inflammation of the left-sided paranasal sinuses.

After 20 months disease-free interval, osteoradionecrosis of the mandibula was diagnosed and a pelvigingivomandibulectomy with immediate reconstruction (free osteocutaneous fibula flap) was performed. In the days that followed, he contracted two consecutive bronchopneumonias, MRSA septicaemia and ARDS, followed by bilateral pneumothorax and acute renal insufficiency requiring dialysis. Imaging showed pulmonary fibrosis. Mechanical ventilation was stopped at day 69 after surgery. Chest-tubes were removed and the patient recovered very gradually with a small relapse due to an aspiration pneumonia after removal of his laryngeal canula. The patient was finally discharged at day 170. At 18 months, the patient is in good condition, his flap is viable.

Chimona, Debora Kiagiadaki, George Perogamvrakis, Chariton E. Papadakis ENT Department, Chania General Hospital, Chania, Crete, Greece Introduction: Oral cancer represents about 3% of all cancers. More than 90% of cancers of the oral cavity and oropharynx are squamous cell carcinomas. The incidence of tongue cancer varies among countries from 2.5 to 9 cases per 100,000 per year. The two highest risk factors for tongue malignancies are use of tobacco products and alcohol consumption. Case report: A 78-year-old man presented with a tumor on the right side of the mobile tongue anterior to the circumvallate papilla. Biopsy showed a low-to-median-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The extent of spread of the disease was evaluated with CT, MRI scans and ultrasound of upper abdomen (T2N0M1-bone metastasis). The patient finally underwent a total body PET/CT scan in order to be restaged (down-staged to T2N0M0). A laser partial anterior glossectomy was performed and the patient was discharged the 9th day of his hospitalization in good health. Conclusion: Treatments for tongue cancer are based on the location extent and stage of the disease and may involve surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Laser partial anterior glossectomy is a reliable surgical approach that prevents the intraoperative spread of the disease, controls bleeding and reduces postoperative pain and edema because of minimal damage to adjacent tissues. Introduction: Schwannomas are neurogenic tumors that arise from the Schwann cells of the nerve sheath. They are benign, usually solitary, and encapsulated neoplasms. The most common intraoral site of occurrence is the tongue, followed by the palate and the buccal mucosa, with the lip being an extremely rare site. Case report: We report such a case of a 16-year-old male patient with schwannoma of the lower lip. Complete excision of the tumour and reconstruction with local advancement mucosa flap led to cure without any aesthetic deficit. Histological examination and immunohistochemical staining are used for the diagnosis. Conclusions: Even though, based on the literature review, schwannoma of the lip is a clinical rarity, it should be taken into consideration in the differential diagnosis of a lower lip mass.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PP068"}, {"text": "Massive bleeding due to maxillary artery aneurysm treated with endovascular coils in a terminal patient with head and neck cancer. case report A.

Both patients had progressive, not controlled after surgery and radiotherapy, ulcerative face cancer infested with larvae. Materials and methods: The larvae of the flies were collected directly from the infested areas, washed with sterile saline and placed into vials containing 90\u00b0alcohol in order to preserve them. Results: The larvae were identified morphologically, according to taxonomic keys, in both cases to be Wohlfahrtia magnifica. They were of 2nd and 3rd larval stages. The spinules on the body were strong, well pigmented and numerous. The posterior peritremes were characteristic. Conclusions: W. magnifica is widely distributed over the warmer parts of the Palaearctic region, being the most common agent of animal traumatic myiasis in Greece. Adult flies are most active during summer and they are diurnal, favouring the hot hours of the day. They give birth to very mobile larvae of the first stage near skin lesions, which grow rapidly into the trauma. It is recommended first to remove the larvae mechanically and then to wash it with a mixture of saline and insecticide before covering the wound with paraffin cream.

Conclusions: Breast cancer remains the commonest primary tumour giving rise to orbital metastases and has an overall poor prognosis. Commonly patients present with ocular motility restriction, while periorbital oedema and acute visual deterioration are not frequently reported clinical features. Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a relatively uncommon malignant tumour derived from smooth muscle cells that rapidly metastasizes to distant regions. It rarely reaches oral tissues in which smooth muscle tissues are absent. We report the case of a 56-year-old woman who presented with LMS in the maxilla that had metastasized from a primary tumour in her uterus, received a total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingooophorectomy 9 months earlier. To reveal the poor prognosis of metastatic LMS, a total of 26 antibodies against different factors related to the proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, and angiogenesis were simultaneously applied on the immunohistochemistry and immunoblot detection in order to screen for expression of different proteins in the metastatic LMS. Compared with the immunoreactions of primary uterine LMS, the different antibodies for cellular proliferation, i.e., PCNA, MPN-2, Max, p21, CDK4, p53, Rb-1, Bad, Bcl-2, EGF-R, HGF, C-erbb2, Maspin, and DMBT-1, and those for angiogenesis, i.e., vWF, CD31, and angiogenin, were more intensely expressed, while Bax, p16, Wnt-1, E-cadherin, and APC were relatively weakly expressed. Beta-catenin was densely localized to the nuclei of tumour cells. These data suggest that rapid proliferation of the tumour cells is related to over-expression of different oncogenes, and that the infiltrative growth and early distant metastasis of these tumour cells are related to over-expression of angiogenesis factors. A total of seven cases of metastatic LMS to the oral cavity that had been published in the English literature were reviewed, and the reason for the poor prognosis in the metastatic LMS is suggested. Introduction: The surgical treatment of the head and neck cancer is a challenging procedure concerning not only a radical excision, but foremost the achievement of a satisfactory functional and aesthetic result. Purpose: We present two patients with squamous cell carcinoma at the preauricular area and on the temple. Materials: We analyse their surgical treatment using radical excision and appropriate flap/graft for reconstruction. The first patient had extensive parotid tissue malignancy secondary to a scalp carcinoma and the second one a large tumor of the skin on the temple. The physical findings of the first patient included facial nerve paralysis, fixation to surrounding tissue and associated cervical lymphadenopathy. Methods: A radical en bloc resection of the parotid gland was decided to be the appropriate treatment for the first patient. Modified neck dissection was considered essential in this case because of the cervical lymphadenopathy and the high-grade malignancy and was performed at the same setting as the parotidectomy. The second patient underwent a radical resection of the skin to the scalp and face area where the tumor extended. The soft tissue defects were covered with regional flap (a large rotation flap from scalp skin). The secondary defect created during rotation of this large flap was covered by a splitthickness skin graft. Results: We had no postoperative complications, such as surgical site infections, hematoma, necrosis of flaps and grafts or an open wound. Bleeding was minimized by intraoperative hemostasis and a wellplaced dressing that applied pressure over the wound and undermined areas. Conclusion: Even though squamous cell carcinoma is associated with a significant risk for metastases, the goal of surgery is still complete removal with negative surgical margins. Each defect is unique and each has its own challenges. Full rotation flaps provide good results and can be managed successfully by an experienced otolaryngologist.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PP074"}, {"text": "Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol (2010) 267 (Suppl 1):S1-S117 Introduction: The ameloblastoma is a benign odontogenic tumour that is locally aggressive and tends to recur following treatment.

During surgery, an extensive carcinoma of the parathyroid gland was found. Therefore, the tumor was resected together with the regional lymph nodes, the ipsilateral portion of the thyroid gland and parts of the muscle layer of the upper esophagus. Immediately after surgery, serum values dropped to normal. Healing of the osteolytic lesion in the mandible was uneventful. Laboratory values of calcium and parathyroid hormone were determined at regular intervals. Rising levels of both parameters indicated a recurrence. 29 months after the first operation, a more extensive local resection and a neck dissection, including the infiltrated N. laryngeus recurrens, was performed. 42 months later, a second recurrence was found and again locally resected. Discussion and conclusion: Parathyroid hormone stimulates the activity of osteoclasts, accelerates bone turnover and-when produced in excessive amounts-may give rise to so-called ''brown tumors of hyperparathyroidism''. Frequently, symptoms such as nausea, pain, kidney stones or gastric ulcers are due to hypercalcemia. As central giant cell granuloma (CGCG) is both clinically and histopathologically indistinguishable from the brown tumor, determination of the serum levels of calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) in every patient with CGCG is mandatory. Our case emphasizes the importance to investigate the underlying disease for possibly increased serum levels of calcium and PTH once the diagnosis of a CGCG has been firmly established. Moderately elevated serum levels usually hint at a benign adenoma whereas very high levels are more indicative of a carcinoma of the parathyroid gland. Therapy consists of surgical resection with healthy margins. In our case radiotherapy was deferred as recurrence was expected and indeed occurred. For early detection of a recurrence, long-term monitoring of the laboratory levels (calcium and PTH) is strongly recommended.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PP078"}, {"text": "Introduction: Carcinoma cuniculatum is a rare, distinct clinico-pathological variant of squamous cell carcinoma that is characterised histologically by a defining infiltrative pattern of deep, broad and complex proliferation of stratified squamous epithelium with keratin cores and keratin-filled crypts.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PP078"}, {"text": "Purpose, materials and methods: We briefly review the world literature and present a case report of carcinoma cuniculatum of the oral tongue.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PP078"}, {"text": "Results: A 61-year-old male presented with a biopsy-proven cT4N0M0 carcinoma cuniculatum of the oral tongue.

The tumor was expanding, multinodular, not that hard, measuring about 16 mm in diameter. According to the woman's medical history, there was an injury in the site of the tumor 8 years ago. In the site of the injury a rather hard scar had remained. This scar had turned into the above-described tumor through the last 3 months.

Purpose: We present a rare case of ACC of the nasopharynx diagnosed in our department. Materials and methods: The patient was a 52-year-old man who was referred to us because of mild respiratory distress and diplopia. The clinical examination (direct nasopharyngoscopy) revealed a cauliflower, exophytic tumor in the nasopharynx and a paresis of the VIth cranial nerve ipsilateraly.

Introduction: The retropharyngeal space is a distinct space located at midline of posterior pharyngeal wall. Bounded by the buccopharyngeal fascia anteriorly and the alar fascia posteriorly, this space is limited above by the base of the skull, and below where the alar fascia fuses with the buccopharyngeal fascia at about the level of T4 and the carina. Normally, lymph nodes and fat are found. In literature rarely are mentioned pseudotumors of retropharyngeal space such as anatomical variants of the carotid artery or internal jugular vein and degenerative alterations or anatomical variations of regional bone structures and damages of muscle such as hypertrophy of the levator scapulae muscle and fibrosis of sternocleidomastoeid muscle. Materials and methods: We report two cases of elderly patients of ENT department with pseudotumor of retropharyngeal space that caused dysphagia for solid foods.

Materials: A male patient presented with a painless, hard consistent, fixated to the deep structures mass, 3 9 2 cm, at the left parotid area free of the overlying skin. 10 years ago, he was treated with radiotherapy (70 Gy) for stage T2N0M0 nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Methods: In the patient endoscopy of the nasal cavity and the nasopharynx and also CT scan of the splachnic scull, neck, chest and abdomen were performed. Secondly a total lateral lobectomy of the left parotid gland was performed. Results: Biopsy of the mass revealed undifferentiated sarcoma of the parotid. Conclusions: Radiation-induced neoplasms are rare, but patients irradiated for NPC receive a dose that is sufficient to cause these tumours. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most frequent histological type. Radiation-induced sarcomas tend to occur 10-20 years after treatment. Published reports on postirradiation sarcomas have indicated a cumulative incidence of 0.03 to 0.08%. Postirradiation sarcomas of the parotid gland after radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma are very rare and there was no previously reported case. Introduction: Burkitt's lymphoma is an aggressive non-Hodgkin large B cell lymphoma which can be classified into endemic, sporadic, and immunodeficiency variants. Burkitt's lymphoma was first discovered in Africa, where it is the most common type of childhood cancer.

Results: CT, MR imaging and intraoperative exploration revealed the well-defined margined tumors without infiltration in compartment of muscles. Case 4 was the only one diagnosed as DF preoperatively, according to the CT and MR imaging which may represent the areas of low cellularity and abundant collagen content. In all cases, the tumors were removed by conservative excision. After a mean followup of 49.5 months, all patients were alive with no evidence of recurrence. Conclusions: DF is a benign fibroblastic neoplasm with distinctive clinical, CT or MR imaging and pathological characteristics. CT and MR imaging might help to diagnose preoperatively.

Materials and methods: A patient requiring a pharyngoplasty procedure was seen in the plastics surgery clinic for the assessment of free flap surgical reconstruction for subglottic stenosis. A stand alone DINAMAP pulse oximeter with plethysmography was used to assess hand circulation. The probe was attached to her index finger and a baseline waveform and saturation was established. Then firm compression was applied to the radial artery with two fingers whilst observing the waveform and saturation. Within 1-2 min, the saturation began to fall steadily reaching 49% in 2 min and became undetectable in 3 min with the waveform flat lining. Release of compression resulted in the wave form and saturation being restored to pre-procedure levels in 1-2 min.

Introduction: Metastatic tumors to the oral region are uncommon and most are located in the mandible, with only a few in the soft oral tissues. Oral metastases are located in the mandible 80-90% on average, the maxilla location being rarer. The prevalent primary sites are the liver, the colon, the stomach and the esophagus. In all cases the diseases had disseminated when the gingival metastases were diagnosed. Metastatic disease of the jaws is unusual and accounts for 1-4% of oral cavity malignancies.

Materials: This study included patients suffering from lateral pharyngeal space tumors surgically treated. The majority of these tumors were benign and the most frequent was pleomorphic adenoma. The following surgical approaches were used: intraoral, transcervical and transmandibular, with different types and numbers of mandible osteotomies. Methods: The type of surgical approach was dictated by the type of the lesion (malignant or benign), the exact location, the size, the vascularity and the relationship of the tumor to the neck neurovascular bundle. Results: In all cases the selected surgical approach allowed the complete excision of the tumor, obtaining clear margins in cases of malignancy. The choice of the approach type was also made in order to remove the lesion safely without adding to the patient's preoperative morbidity. Conclusions: It was concluded that the surgical approach of the lateral pharyngeal space tumors must be adjusted to the tumor characteristics and must be as wide as is necessary to achieve its complete removal with safety. Permacol is a strong biological, non-absorbable implant with natural properties that make it suitable for use in the maxillofacial region.

Intraoperative monitoring of neurophysiological function has gradually evolved as an integral adjunct during parotid surgery to reduce the incidence of neurological deficits. The goals of facial nerve monitoring are early identification of the nerve, warning the surgeon of any unexpected stimulation, mapping the course of the nerve, reducing trauma to the nerve during dissection, and evaluation and prognosis of facial nerve function at the conclusion of surgery. Purpose: To assess the reliability of continuous intraoperative facial nerve monitoring during primary surgery for superficial parotid lesions. Materials and methods: Over the last 3 years, the facial nerve of 35 consecutive patients undergoing parotid surgery was stimulated intraoperatively using an electromyograph-based intraoperative facial nerve monitoring. Facial nerve paralysis was estimated using the House-Brackmann grading scale. Immediate post-operative facial paralysis was documented in 11 patients. None of them had permanent paralysis after 6 months of follow-up. Results: Intraoperative facial nerve monitoring failed to timely identify and confirm the facial nerve trunk in six operations despite anatomical and visual confirmation by the surgeon. The facial nerve probe was therefore replaced and in five cases this resulted in electromyograph-based confirmation. However, in one case despite replacing all connections as well as the probe, the operation was completed without monitoring. Purpose: To define effectiveness of cryotherapy for primary and recurrence nose skin cancer; to clarify the possibility of cryotherapy for elderly patients; to assess cosmetic effect and long-term results. Patients and methods: A total of 131 patients with nose skin neoplasm were analyzed. Cryotherapy was performed in 84 patients with basal cell carcinoma and in 47 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of nose skin between 1973 and 2001 years. Histopathologic examination of tumor was performed for all patients. Of all patients, 82.7% were elder than 50 years old. Of all patients, 66% were suffered from concomitant diseases of different severity. Allocation of patients according to TNM classification was: T1N0M0 (n = 38), T1N1M0 (n = 2), T2N0M0 (n = 8), T2N1M0 (n = 1), T3N0M0 (n = 5), T4N0M0 (n = 11), T4N1M0 (n = 4), T4N0M1 (n = 1). Local and advanced recurrences were appeared in 22 and 40 patients, respectively. Results: Recurrences of skin carcinoma was obtained in 2 (3%) of 71 followed up patients with stage T1-2N0M0 and local recurrences after different initial therapy. Deformation external nose was avoided due to cryotherapy in patient with restricted primary and recurrence tumors. Recurrence rate was 46% in patients with advanced recurrences and T3-4N0-1M0-1. Death rate was 32%. Unfavorable prognostic factors were associated with distant metastases, 8 of 11 patients died for metastases at 1 year. Different external nose defects were formed after cryotherapy for vast tumors. Plastic reconstruction and prosthetics were needed in 11 patients. Patients with concomitant diseases tolerate cryotherapy very good. Conclusion: Cryotherapy for skin carcinoma was effective in patients with early stages and restricted recurrences of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of nose skin. It allows keeping integrity of skin and achieved excellent cosmetic effect and long-term results in most cases. Cryotherapy does not deteriorate general condition in elderly patients with concomitant diseases. (78) and squamous cell carcinoma (34) of the skin in head and neck region were treated. The majority of the tumors involved many structures of the face, metastases in regional lymphatic glands were detected in 7 (20.6%) patients with squamous cell carcinoma. We used surgery (26), combined treatment (8), cryosurgery (20) and cryo-radiotherapy (58) for treatment of the patients. Cryosurgery was used in cases without deep cancer infiltration of tissue. Cryosurgery technique included 3 cycles of tumors freezing-thawing to achieve necrosis in all tumors tissue and in tissue around the tumor. Cryo-radiotherapy was used in cases with deep cancer infiltration. We perform tumors freezing without damage of normal tissue every time a few minutes before radiotherapy in dose 2-3 Gy till complete tumors regression. The total dose was 60-70 Gy. Surgical operation was performed in cases, when the tumor size and location makes it possible to perform wide surgical removal of the tumor with effective reconstruction of the site of surgery. Results: Follow-up ranged from 2 to 11 years. No mortality rate due to treatment complications was noted. Recurrence rate was 14.3% (16 patients). Using cryosurgery and cryo-radiotherapy, the individual anatomy and functions of the face structures were saved with good rehabilitation. Conclusion: Cryosurgery and cryo-radiotherapy are effective methods of skin cancer treatment with good aesthetic and functional results. The development of principles of skin cancer treatment with the use of cryogen techniques can help to improve the results of treatment of patients with advanced skin cancer of the head and neck. Purpose: Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common benign salivary gland tumor. The essential components of the tumor are the epithelial and stromal elements. Because the malignacy is correlated with the duration of pleomorphic adenoma, the risk of developing malignancy is only about 1.5% for a duration of\\5 years, but increases to 9.5% for a duration of[15 years. Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma is believed to evolve from a pre-existing benign adenoma. It accounts for 3.6% (range 0.9-14%) of all salivary neoplasms and for 11.7% (range 2.8-42.4%) of salivary malignancies. The increase of tumor vascularisation plays an important role in tumor malignant transformation. Aim: To evaluate the vasculogenesis in the stromal and epithelial component of salivary gland tumors and compare it with the clinical data. Materials and methods: Patients with salivary gland tumors were operated and clinically analyzed in Riga East University Hospital department of head and neck surgery. Immunohistochemistry was applied for primary pleomorphic adenoma, recurrent tumors and malignant parotid tumors in order to determine vasculogenesis and compare with the normal salivary gland tissue. Results: The actin expression was different in stromal and epithelial components of salivary gland tumors and normal salivary gland tissue. In cases of pleomorphic adenoma, the differences of actin expression were determined in primary and recurrent tumors especially in stromal part of the tumors. Introduction: Preoperative embolization has been widely used to reduce intraoperative blood loss during excision of the carotid body tumors. Different materials are used as embolic agents. Purpose: To report our experience with preoperative embolization in the management of patients with carotid body tumors. Materials and methods: Ten patients (9 women, 1 man) aged 37-60 years with carotid body tumors underwent selective ascending pharyngeal artery embolization to decrease operative blood loss. PVA microspheres (BeadBlock TM , Biocompatibles) size ranges 100-300, 300-500 and 500-700 lm were used. The mean amount of introduced microspheres was 2.14 ml. Microcatheter was applied in 3 cases. Subadventitial tumor resection was performed in 3-15 days after embolization. Results: The embolization was successful in all cases. One patient underwent two embolizations. Subtotal tumor devascularisation on completion angiogram was achieved in 6 cases and total in 1 case. The delivery of microspheres through microcatheter was easy and no clogging occurred. No complications of embolization were encountered. The mean operative blood loss was 138.6 \u00b1 14 ml. Deep penetration of particles into the tumor vasculature was noticed on microscopy in all resected specimens. Conclusion: Preoperative embolization utilizing Bead Block microspheres is safe and efficacious for decreasing operative blood loss in patients with carotid body tumors. Introduction: Although standard superficial or total parotidectomy is used as a common surgery for benign tumor of parotid, there are many complications which are facial paresis or facial nerve injure, Frey's syndrome and sensory deficit of ear lobule. Modification techniques including subtotal parotidectomy, partial superficial parotidectomy, extracapsular lumpectomy, or extracapsular excision have been introduced. We suggest a modified parotidectomy to prevent the complications. Purpose: In recent decades the treatment of benign tumor of parotid has shifted from superficial or total parotidectomy to partial parotidectomy. This study examined whether the modified parotidectomy reduces the complications after surgery for benign tumor of parotid. Methods: One hundred and ten patients were assigned to the modified parotidectomy (group 1 n = 55) or the standard superficial or total parotidectomy (group 2, n = 55). The modified parotidectomy consisted of greater auricular nerve preservation, partial parotidectomy and coverage with the parotid fascia. Results: The mean volume of hemorrhage was significantly smaller (P \\ 0.01), and mean operation time was significantly shorter (P \\ 0.001) than that in group 2. In group 1, the auricular nerve sensory recovery rate was high, and transient facial paralysis and Frey's syndrome were infrequent (12 and 6%, respectively) than that in group 2. There was no significant difference in tumor recurrence, comparing two groups during a mean follow-up of 4 years. Conclusion: Compared with the standard superficial and total protidectomy, the modified parotidectomy for benign parotid tumors improved cosmetic, sensory and reduced the duration of surgery and Frey's syndrome.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PP107"}, {"text": "Methods: The data were analyzed retrospectively for 55 patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma of HN, to evaluate the clinical characters, diagnostic and therapeutical aspects and the contribution of every factor influencing the survival.

Results: There were 38 patients in stages III and IV. Most of them received surgical operation combined with radiotherapy. 45.5% received surgery and radiotherapy, 18% received radiotherapy and 16.3% received surgery. 14% of patients had metastases and were treated by chemotherapy, and 14% of patients were not treated. The 5year survival rates were 31%. Patients who received surgery combined with radiotherapy had higher survival than those how received surgery or radiotherapy alone. Conclusions: Surgery is preferable for primary and recurrent adenoid cystic carcinoma of the head and neck.

All patients were treated with curative intent, with surgery followed by postoperative high dose external beam radiotherapy. Results: With a median follow up of 75 months (range 48-112 months), the locoregional control rate was 91%, cancer-specific survival was 74% and overall survival 54% at 5 years. Conclusions: We conclude that surgery plus radiotherapy achieves excellent locoregional control, but deaths from metastatic disease remain a problem. Better systemic therapies are required to address this problem. Introduction: Chondrosarcoma is a malignant mesenchymal tumor characterized by the formation of cartilage, but not bone, by tumor cells. Only 5-10% of chondrosarcomas occur in the head and neck, representing 0.1% of all head and neck neoplasms, with the larynx and the maxillo-nasal region being the most common sites. Chondrosarcomas are slow-growing tumours with low malignancy rate and unclear histopathogenesis. They arise from cartilaginous remnants in the petro-clival, spheno-occipital and fronto-nasal synchondroses. Purpose, materials and methods: In this study, we reviewed chondrosarcoma cases experienced during the last 30 years to investigate its clinical characteristics and treatment outcome. Results: Histologic types included conventional, myxoid and mesenchymal. The mesenchymal and myxoid subtypes were rare among white patients and more common among African-American and Hispanic patients. Treatment was most commonly surgery alone and surgery with irradiation. Disease-specific survival was 87.2% at 5 years and 70.6% at 10 years. Worse 5-year survival was associated with higher grade, regional or distant spread and the myxoid or mesenchymal subtypes. Grade was the most important prognostic factor. Tumor size and completeness of surgical resection were also important prognostic factors. The primary sites were sinus, mastoid, jugular foramen and thyroid cartilage. Specific sites included the larynx, trachea, petrous apex, skull base, cervical spine, clivus and cavernous sinus region. Conclusions: Early diagnosis and adequate surgical resection are important to get better survival rates. Treatment should be aimed at complete surgical resection with the option of postoperative radiotherapy. Treatment with partial excision is preferable due to intracranial involvement of the internal carotid artery. High-grade lesions should be treated aggressively. The most common cause of death was uncontrollable local disease. Introduction: Orofacial tumors are the sixth most common malignancy in the world, and there is a recent trend of rising incidence of these tumors in young patients. Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the head and neck is a rare malignancy of salivary gland origin. Purpose: Few epidemiologic studies exist assessing the incidence of this tumour. The aim of this study was to compare demographic and etiologic data from young and old patients with orofacial ACC. Materials and methods: Data were obtained by retrospective analysis of files of patients with malignant orofacial ACC. Results: Patients were categorized into 2 groups: the young group (B40 years old) and the older group ([60 years old). There was no predilection of sex in both younger and older groups (malefemale ratio was 0.98). Consumption of tobacco and alcohol was reported by 10% of young patients and by 25% of older patients. Palate was the most common site for older group (29%), whereas that for the younger group was the parotid (12.7%). We found that these tumors can occur in patients who report no tobacco or alcohol use.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Nedlands, Australia"}, {"text": "Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol (2010) 267 (Suppl 1):S1-S117 ", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "S58"}, {"text": "Imaging diagnosis of acoustic neurinoma-some aspects: a radiological study", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PP119"}, {"text": "Neurosurgical Unit-CT Unit, Venizeleio General Hospital, Heraklion, Crete, Greece", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Nikolaos Syrmos, George Gavridakis"}, {"text": "Acoustic neurinoma is a benign tumor that may develop on the hearing and balance nerves near the inner ear. The tumor results from an overproduction of Schwann cells-small, sheet-like cells that normally wrap around nerve fibers like onion skin and help support the nerves. When growth is abnormally excessive, Schwann cells bunch together, pressing against the hearing and balance nerves, often causing gradual hearing loss, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and dizziness. If the tumor becomes large, it can interfere with the facial nerve, causing partial paralysis, and eventually pressing against brain structures, becoming life-threatening. There are two types of acoustic neurinomas: unilateral and bilateral. Unilateral neurinomas affect only one ear and account for approximately 8% of tumors inside the skull. Symptoms may develop at any age, but usually occur between the ages of 30 and 60 years. Bilateral acoustic neurinomas, which affect both ears, are hereditary. Inherited from one's parents, this tumor results from a genetic disorder known as neurofibromatosis-2 (NF2). Affected individuals have a 50% chance of passing this disorder on to their children. Unlike those with a unilateral acoustic neurinoma, individuals with NF2 usually develop symptoms in their teens or early adulthood. Because NF2 patients usually have multiple tumors, the surgical procedure is more complicated than the removal of a unilateral acoustic neurinoma. Scientists believe that both types of acoustic neurinoma form following a loss of the function of a gene on chromosome 22. Early diagnosis of an acoustic neurinoma is a key to prevent its serious consequences. Unfortunately, early detection of the tumor is sometimes difficult, because the symptoms may be subtle and may not appear in the beginning stages of growth. Also, hearing loss, dizziness, and tinnitus are common symptoms of any middle and inner ear problems. Therefore, once the symptoms appear, a thorough ear examination and hearing test are essential for proper diagnosis. CT and MRI are helpful in determining the location and size of a tumor and also in planning its removal. MRI examinations were performed in 10 patients with 11 acoustic neuromas, and the results were compared with conventional tomography of the internal auditory canals, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), and air CT cisternography. All tumors were identified with MRI. The 5 largest tumors looked similar to the tumors seen on CT scans, although the extent of the tumor was better seen with MRI in 2 cases. The 6 small cerebellopontine angle and intracanalicular tumors were well seen with MRI, with appearances corresponding to those seen with air CT cisternography. Side effects were encountered with the MRI examinations. MRI is an accurate, noninvasive alternative to contrast-enhanced CT and air CT cisternography in the diagnosis of acoustic neuromas. Measurements of the maximal tumour diameter along the pyramid showed good concordance. We conclude that measurement of the size of acoustic neuromas is reproducible with MRI and the measurement of the maximal tumour diameter is in practice, a better parameter for comparison than calculation of real volume.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Nikolaos Syrmos, George Gavridakis"}, {"text": "The natural history of globus pharyngeus (2010) 267 (Suppl 1):S1-S117 analysis was performed to evaluate the surgical margins, the histological grade and the clinical stage as prognostic factors for the disease.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PP120"}, {"text": "Results: A total of 51 patients with head and neck sarcomas were admitted at the INCan, The most frequent location sites were: scalp and face.

All these patients were treated in the Department of Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery in Lodz between 1997 and 2007 and they possessed full medical records (at the time of diagnosis). A total of 39 cases were identified and of these, 22 occurred in women and 17 occurred in men between age from 19 to 79. The degree (level) of clinical advancement of disease was valued on the basis of TNM (was staged according to the TNM) at the moment of starting the treatment. In a series of 39 cases, 30 were recognized (diagnosis) as oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), in five cases malignant tumours arising from the salivary glands were identified, in two mucosal malignant melanoma and in two malignant no epithelial tumors (mesenchymal). The majority of these tumors were high grade according to the World Health Organization. Results: The obtained ratio of 5-year survival for patients being observed at least 5 years after operation was 72%. Two persons with diagnosed sarcoma disease died within 6 months counting from a moment of diagnosis and treatment start. It turned out that the most effective practice was to radical surgical treatment complemented with post-operative radiotherapy and/or sometimes chemical therapy. The factor that mostly influenced the effectiveness of therapy was advancement of disease at the time of diagnosis as well as the state of regional lymph nodes. Conclusions: The unfavourable results of treatment of malignant tumours of the jaw and maxillary sinus are mainly caused by a fact that patients consult practitioner too late what results in their diseases being highly advanced.

The aim of this study is an attempt to determine the influence of environmental and demographic factors on the development of tumors of head and neck. The study has also undertaken an effort to answer questions concerning the reasons for delays in the diagnosis of the tumors of head and neck. Materials and methods: The material of the study is consisting of a group of 527 ill persons aged between 7 and 93 (average age 59.9) who were diagnosed with the tumor of the head and neck region for the first time. The information has been gathered from the medical documentation of patients treated at The ENT Department of The District Hospital in Radom during years 2002-2006. The analysis of this group of patients has included social-demographic data such as: age, sex, place of residence, occupation, presence of addictions (tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking), presence of coexisting diseases, and the fact of suffering from any disease in the past. In addition, the following information concerning the tumorous disease has been gathered: location of the change, notified complaints, time duration of the disease with a division into stages-from the appearance of the first disease symptoms until the first visit to the family doctor, from the first visit to the family doctor until the first visit to the specialist, from the first visit to the specialist to the first stay at the hospital the setting of the clinical diagnosis and the initiation of a proper treatment. The advancement of the tumorous process is defined in the study according to the TNM system. The data received have been recorded in a form of self-made questionnaire. Results: The analyzed material constitutes mostly of males (71.9%) in the fifth and seventh life-decade (30.5 and 24.3%, respectively). Changes concerning non-malignant tumors were most often located in salivary glands (23.1%) and changes related to malignant tumors were located in larynx and lower throat (50.4%). Among malignant tumors, the squamous cell carcinoma predominated in majority of cases (84.9%). The research results have shown a significant influence of tobacco smoking and alcohol overuse in the occurrence of malignant tumors of head and neck. The analysis of all stages of the patient diagnosis has demonstrated the fact that students and persons with a university educations, living in a large town, were the quickest to visit a medical practitioner after the occurrence of the first disease symptoms. Furthermore, the study has demonstrated the substantial deficiency in health awareness of patients, who reported themselves to the medical practitioner too late after noticing the first symptoms of the tumorous disease (105.3 days on average). The study has also revealed the inappropriate treatment of the ill by medical practitioners of the elementary medical care, who often waited too long before sending patients to a specialized laryngologist. The consequence of these decisions was too long a time span for setting the proper diagnosis confirmed by the histopathological examination-144.7 days on average.

Introduction: Oral cancer is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. Surgery is the most well-established mode of initial definitive treatment for a majority of oral cancers. Management should be planned according to the tumor's characteristics, patient factors and expertise of the medical team. Objective: The aim of this article is to report the recurrence and survival of a group of patients with epidermoide oral carcinoma that were treated surgically, by local resection, neck dissection and with adjuvant post-operative radiotherapy. Materials and methods: The study included a group of patients with the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma in the oral cavity. These patients were treated in our hospital (CHUAC, Spain) from 1998 to 2008. All the patients were treated surgically by local resection and neck dissection. In advanced stages use post-operative radiotherapy. We studied age, sex, clinical stage, surgical treatment, recurrence and survival. Results: Early stages (stages I and II) were managed with a single modality, and advanced tumours (stages III and IV) with multimodality therapy. The greater percentage was male patients, advanced age, and stages III and IV. The survival of the patients who integrate our study is 60%. Discussion: Over the course of the past 30 years, there has been improvement in the overall survival of patients with oral carcinoma largely due to the improved understanding of the biology of local progression, early identification and treatment of metastatic lymph nodes in the neck, and employment of adjuvant post-operative radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy.

Local recurrence and second primary tumors account for the majority of deaths. ''Field cancerization'' and ''second field tumor'' were coined in an effort to explain these calamities. However, the establishment of tumor-driven immunosuppressive network during malignant progression is now appreciated. Developing tumors do not need to create tolerance systematically local immune privilege will suffice. The key first step, however, is local suppression of tumor-specific immune responses. Materials and methods: Interplay between an early lesion (premalignant or even a chronic inflammation) and its draining lymph node(s) results in the foundation of a local tolerance state both in the primary site and the DLNs, prior to node metastasis. It is also known that suppression is encountered in metastasized nodes as well as in adjacent nodes. In addition, recent SLNB studies in oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas revealed that: (a) tumors (especially midline, even T1) drain bilaterally, and (b) some tumors drain outside the ''traditional'' basin. It seems that factors such as chemokines and VEGF-C play a significant role in lympagiogenesis apart from the mechanistic model of lymph flow. Also, HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer, while metastasizing early, have better prognosis, and even if multiple primaries occur, there is lack of field cancerization. These properties may be due to specific genetic alterations and tropism seen in this particular group, but robust immune response against this virally induced tumor has a major contribution. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that DLNs immunosuppression renders areas in continuity to primary tumor or seemingly distant, but with shared DLNs, unable to relay ''danger'' signals and generate immune response. These locales are more vulnerable to a local recurrence or second tumor and thus appear to be immune-privileged. Neo adjuvant chemotherapy in 37.9% and adjuvant chemotherapy in 62.1% were done.

NBI (Narrow Band Imaging) endoscopy system is reported that it has efficacy in diagnosis of early stage of SCCs such as superficial carcinoma. We evaluated the efficacy of NBI system for diagnosis of the primary lesions in cases of PUCM. Patients: In this presentation, after elaborate examination of head and neck more than 3 times with transnasal endoscopy and naked eye by more than two ENT doctors, 11 cases were diagnosed as PUCM. In all of them, primary lesions could not be detected with gastrointestinal endoscopy, CT scanning of head, neck, and lung, and Ga scintigram or PET. Result: In 7 cases out of 11, SCCs that seemed to be primary lesions were detected. In 5 cases out of the 7, the primary lesions were detected with NBI endoscopy. In 2 cases out of the 5, the primary lesions were recognized as increase of abnormal vessels. In the rest of 3 cases, the lesions were recognized as sub-epithelial tumors. Conclusion: In PUCM of SCCs, findings of sub-epithelial tumors must not be overlooked. NBI endoscopy seems to be effective to detect primary lesions in cases of PUCM.

This was followed by nasopharyngeal forceps biopsy for haematoxylin-eosin staining and histology examination. The method was used in 217 high risk patients 2004-2008. Meantime, all patients were interviewed personally for factors of late NPC presentation and results were qualitatively analyzed. Results: 97.4% of the patients had the swabbing and biopsy done without local anaesthesia and the cytology's sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 77.3, 100, 100, and 65.7%, respectively. These are comparable with those of EBV EA IgA serology of HK. All patients tolerated the swabbing and biopsy with minimal discomfort or pain. The patients' interviews identified many factors of late diagnosis, including patients' unawareness of NPC seriousness and painless nature, initially time wasted traditional medicine treatment, patients' financial burden and traveling distance seeking specialists. Conclusions: This study shows relative effectiveness of nasopharyngeal cytology method in NPC screening and, by public awareness education of the factors of late NPC presentation, the method is further enhanced for patients to seek early NPC detection. Purpose: 18 FDG BTV delineation methods in SCCHN have no agreed consensus. We assessed the impact of SUV Cut Off (SUVCO), percentage threshold of the SUVMax (PTSUVmax) and individualised adaptive threshold (IAT) before and during radiotherapy on BTV delineation. Materials and methods: Ten patients were recruited (SCCHN-primary radical RT or CRT by conventional fractionation) and underwent 18 FDG PET/CT (in thermoplastic shell) 72 h prior to RT (0 Gy), and then at 10, 44, and 66 Gy. The BTV was automatically contoured (PETVCAR) on the PET/CT at 0 Gy (SUVCO of: 2.5, 3.0, 3.5 and 4.0 bwg/ml; PTSUVmax of: 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50%, and an IAT). This was automatically co-registered with PET/CT at 10, 44, or 66 Gy and BTV delineated. Results: Eight patients (8 primary and 20 lymph node BTVs) were evaluated (mean age 61.9 years). The primary and lymph node volume reduced (p = 0.01-0.0002) at each threshold level compared to the 2.5 bwg/ml SUVCO (shown in Fig. 1 ) or 30% PTSUVmax at each imaging point. This was only significant at 36-50 Gy (p = 0.01), and 66 Gy (p = 0.01-0.004) for the SUVCO thresholds. The BTV delineated by PTSUVmax increased with RT dose (35.73-133.49% greater at 66 Gy compared to baseline). IAT BTV was not significantly different between imaging points. SUVmax negatively correlated (primary and LN) with radiation dose. The background SUV (1.16-1.45bwg/ml) did not vary with radiation dose. Conclusion: PTSUVmax is susceptible to the background SUV during RT. The method of 18 FDG BTV delineation will influence IMRT as smaller volumes give the greatest possibility of dose escalation to improve local control. Introduction: Targeting of receptor tyrosine-kinases by lapatinib is introduced into multimodal therapy concepts for advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Purpose: To analyze whether lapatinib combined with cisplatin exerts synergistic suppressive effects on colony formation of HNSCC ex vivo in a short-time ex vivo colony-forming assay-flavin-protecting conditions (FLAVINO). Methods: Biopsies of 72 HNSCC were taken, minced, collagenasedigested and added into microtiterplates containing serial dilutions of lapatinib or medium plus solvent (DMSO) as control. Same lapatinib concentrations were tested also in combination with cisplatin (1.67, 3.33, or 6.67 lM, corresponding to , , or exactly its tolerable plasma level). After 72-h incubation, wells were washed and cultures ethanol-fixed. Following pan-cytokeratin staining of epithelial cells using a fluorescent-labeled antibody, fluorescent colonies were counted. Results: 33 (64.7%) of 51 in vitro growing HNSCC showed sufficient colony formation allowing for cut-off detection. Cut-off (complete chemotherapeutical-suppressed colony formation) was reached either by 3.33 lM cisplatin or 6.25 lM lapatinib alone only in one (3.0%), and three HNSCC (9.1%), respectively. In combination with 6.25 lM lapatinib and 3.33 lM cisplatin, the doubled number (eight HNSCC = 24.2%) reached cut-off. This synergistic inhibited colony formation is also reflected by the slope of dose-response curves and decreasing IC 50 concentrations (50%-inhibition of colony-formation). For 20 HNSCC with at least four epithelial colonies in controls, the IC 50 medians of lapatinib were 3.17, 3.21, 0.83, and 0.19 lM in the presence of 0.00, 1.67, 3.33, and 6.67 lM cisplatin. Conclusions: Lapatinib in synergism with cisplatin suppresses colony formation of HNSCC ex vivo.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2797, "end": 2803, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "S.

Recent trials and meta-analyses highlight the need to associate chemotherapy with radiotherapy (RT): concomitant chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) appears to be now the standard treatment for locally advanced (T2B and more) and/or node positive (N+) patients. No phase II trials have investigated a two-drug combination during conventional, non-splitted, radiotherapy after a full course of induction chemotherapy. Purpose: Aim of this study was the clinical evaluation of carboplatintaxol combination in a neoadjuvant and concomitant setting with conventional radiotherapy in locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (A-NPC). Materials and methods: Thirty patients having histological confirmed NPC, stages III-IVB according to 2002 AJCC stage classification and who had received no previous CHT and/or RT were treated with three cycles of carboplatin (AUC6) plus taxol (175 mg/m 2 ) on day 1 every 3 weeks, followed by weekly carboplatin (AUC1) plus Taxol (60 mg/m 2 ) and concomitant radiotherapy (70 Gy). Results: The objective complete response rate was 33% (after chemotherapy) and 87% (after chemo-radiotherapy). Treatment tolerability and toxicity were controllable. Three and five years progression-free survival were 80 and 75%, respectively, and 3 and 5 years overall survival were 85 and 80% (follow-up 49.5 months). Five years loco-regional control was 90.3% and 5 years distant metastases free survival was 85%. Conclusions: Neoadjuvant-chemotherapy with such protocol represents a feasible, efficient treatment for patients with A-NPC, ensuring excellent locoregional disease control and overall survival with low incidence of distant metastases. Purpose: ALDH + cells in HNSCC were evaluated using radiotherapy and chemotherapy in combination with a novel SHH inhibitor. Materials and methods: Flow cytometric isolation of cancer cells based on enzymatic activity of ALDH was performed, cells were treated with chemotherapeutic agents, subjected to radiotherapy and treated with a novel inhibitor of the SHH pathway. Results: In evaluating CSC-like properties of ALDH + cells in HNSCC, sorted ALDH + cells demonstrated enhanced colony formation compared to ALDH -cells. HNSCC treated with carboplatin, paclitaxel and cisplatin exhibited a two-to threefold increase in the fraction of ALDH + cells compared to untreated cells. Similarly, these cells displayed enhanced radioresistance with radiotherapy alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. The SHH signaling pathway is modulated by a small molecule inhibitor of smoothened (SMO). Studies examining mechanism of radiosensitizing effects by modulation of DNA repair pathways and synergism of the inhibitor in combination with chemotherapeutic agents are currently undergoing. Conclusions: The stem-cell like population in HNSCC is not directly targeted by standard chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic approaches; however, the identification and effective targeting of this tumorigenic population may contribute significantly to the development of effective therapies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PP162"}, {"text": "Carcinoma of the tongue. the choice of the treatment Ilya Romanov, Liliya Iakovleva, Sevil Alieva Blohin's Cancer Research Center, Moscow, Russia Aim: Cancer of tongue is the mostly repeated form in the oral cancer.

Phase 3 studies evaluating induction chemotherapy (IC) with TPF verses PF prior to radiotherapy have shown improved outcomes. Purpose: To assess the toxicity, tolerability and response of induction TPF chemotherapy prior to radical concurrent chemoradiation. Materials and methods: Data were collected on all head and neck patients at Charing Cross Hospital treated with TPF IC from January to December 2008. Patients were ECOG performance status 0/1 and had stage III/IV disease. Planned treatment consisted of 2-4, threeweekly cycles of TPF (Docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 day 1, cisplatin 75 mg/ m 2 day 1 and 5 fluorouracil 750 mg/m 2 days 1-5 continuous infusion). Objective radiological response was measured following 2 cycles. 60% of patients (20/32) received prohphylactic pegylated growth colony stimulating factor and all received 500 mg ciprofloxacin bd days 5-15.

It is of great important to overcome drug resistance by developing effective reversals. The purpose of this study is to examine whether cisplatin (DDP) can reverse taxol-resistant phenotype of NPC cells and evaluate the rule of TXR1/TSP1 pathway in the reversal of taxol resistance. A drug (taxol)-resistant cell line, CNE-1/Taxol, was established from a human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line, CNE-1. The sensitivity of both CNE-1 and CNE-1/ Taxol to cisplatin or pacliatxel was detected by colony formation assay, and the effect of combination of two drugs was also analyzed. The apoptotic death was measured by flow cytometry. The expression of taxol resistant gene (TXR1) and thrombospondin (TSP1) was determined by RT-PCR and Western blot. The growth inhibition rate in CNE-1/Taxol cells in response to taxol was significantly increased when pre-treated with low-dose cisplatin. However, no change was observed in CNE-1 cells. CNE-1/Taxol cells were more sensitive to cisplatin than CNE-1 cells when exposed to 300-1,500 nM of cisplatin. The combination of cisplatin and pacliatxel exibited a synergistic effect in CNE-1/Taxol cells. An approximate sevenfold increase of RNA expression of TXR1 was observed in taxol-resistant cells compared to their parental cells. Expression level of TSP1 mRNA expression and protein in CNE-1/Taxol cells was 8.9 and 5.6-fold, respectively, lower than in CNE-1. A 8.7-fold increase in TSP1 mRNA expression was observed in CNE-1/Taxol cells exposed to 591.1 nM DDP for 24 h. An increase in TSP1 protein expression was obtained in a dose-dependent manner after CNE-1/Taxol cells exposed to cisplatin ranging from 300 to 1,500 nM. However, there was no change in TXR1 mRNA expression after both CNE-1 and CNE-1/Taxol cells were exposed to DDP.

A novel epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted cytotoxic drug comprising of EGF coupled to bacterial toxin SubA (EGF-SubA) is able to cleave and inactivate GRP78 thus providing a means to target EGFR positive tumour cells. Purpose: Our long-term goal is to evaluate topical application of EGF-SubA upon residual tumour cells, peri-and/or post-operatively with the aim of reducing need for post-operative adjuvant chemo-/ radio-therapy. EGF-SubA is potentially toxic and we therefore investigated the potential of cetuximab to protect cells. Materials: A panel of 7 squamous cell carcinoma cells lines of laryngeal origin was analysed. EGF-SubA was provided by SibTech Inc. Methods: Laryngeal squamous carcinoma cells (LSCCs) were treated in vitro with EGF-SubA to evaluate drug toxicity \u00b1 cetuximab. Cells were monitored for proliferation and cell cycle profile and apoptosis were monitored by flow cytometry. Results: EGF-SubA inhibited growth of LSCCs at low concentrations (IC50 5-100 pM) and induced apoptosis. The application of cetuximab prior to the addition of EGF-SubA significantly improved cell survival (P \\ 0.05) completely rescuing cells from the effects of EGF-SubA. Conclusions: In vitro EGF-SubA is highly cytotoxic to laryngeal squamous cells at picomolar concentrations.

Patients received cisplatin (100 mg/m 2 i.v. day 1), 5-FU (1,000 mg/m 2 /day continuous i.v. days 1-4) every 3 weeks, and cetuximab once weekly (first dose 400 mg/m 2 , subsequent doses 250 mg/m 2 ). Cilengitide was administered by 60 min i.v. infusion on days 1 and 4 each week; cohort 1: 500 mg; cohort 2: 1,000 mg; and cohort 3: 2,000 mg. Results: In phase I, 10 patients were included: cohorts 1 and 2 (each n = 3), cohort 3 (n = 4). Six patients (60%) experienced an adverse event (AE) related to cilengitide: the most common AEs were nausea (n = 4), vomiting (n = 3), asthenia (n = 3), and mucosal inflammation (n = 3). There were no NCI-CTC grade 4 cilengitide-related AEs. Two patients (20%) in cohort 2 experienced four NCI-CTC grade 3 cilengitide-related AEs (mucosal inflammation, asthenia, nausea, and vomiting). There were no relevant differences in AE frequency/severity across the dose levels and no dose-limiting toxicities. A confirmed partial response (PR) was reported in three patients (30%) and stable disease in seven patients (70%), three of whom had an unconfirmed PR. Conclusions: Cilengitide plus cisplatin, 5-FU, and cetuximab was well tolerated.

But head and neck caner patients under CRT often suffer from oropharyngeal mucositis and eating disorders. Therefore the patients cause about 10% of weight loss during hospitalization. Basal energy expenditure (BEE) calculated from Harris-Benedict equation is often multiplied by activity and stress indexes to estimate heat requirement. There are few reports about stress index of the CRT for head and neck cancer patients. So, it is difficult to estimate proper nutrition for these patients. The purpose of this study is to estimate a stress index of the chemoradiation therapy for patients with head and neck cancer. Materials and methods: We examined ten head and neck cancer patients who irradiated to oral cavity and pharynx. Four patients received weekly CDDP with radiotherapy (wCDDP group) and six patients received TPF/FP with radiotherapy (TPF/FP group).

IORT has been utilized for three decades in an effort to curb or prevent disease progression. IORT offers the following advantages: (1) increased normal tissue spare, (2) killing of residual cancer cells, (3) increased biological efficacy per unit dose, and (4) decreased overall treatment time reducing cell repopulation during treatment. Aims and methods: Reviewing all pertinent published articles and addressing issues such as efficacy, safety of IORT as therapeutic technique in conjunction with surgery, external RT (XRT) and chemotherapy. Moreover, parameters as overall survival (OS), locallocoregional failure rates, median dose of IORT, surgical margins, previous external RT, median follow-up are recorded. Conclusions: Patient selection criteria, heterogeneity with respect to disease features, but also imbalances in clinical parameters such as performance status and extensiveness of presalvage workup, could account for the wide variation in published rates of disease control. However, it is clear that IORT is able to control local disease, easier than neck disease, when there are close surgical margins (R0) or even microscopic disease (R1), whereas high failures rates are noticed when gross disease (R2) is present. In the latter group, pain alleviation seems to be the main goal. Second, the addition of postoperative XRT and chemotherapy in selected patients confers better local control rates, reduces the rate of distant metastasis and optimizes OS. Third, IORT is safe as its complication rates are acceptable, especially when dose \\20 Gy, allowing even for a free flap transfer.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PP175"}, {"text": "Oropharyngeal mucositis prophylaxis in combined radioimmunochemotherapy with cetuximab of head and neck cancer Wolf-Oliver Jordan 1 , Ingeborg Wildfang 2 , J\u00fcrgen Borghardt 3 , Sepideh Fanaei 1 , Hayssam Zakaria 1 , Barbara Tschechne 1 1 Praxis Tschechne, Luft, Jordan Onkologie, Lehrte, Germany, 2 Gemeinschaftspraxis fu\u00a8r Radioonkologie und Strahlentherapie, Hannover, Germany, 3 AWO GSD, Abt. Onkologie, Bad Mu\u00a8nder, Germany Introduction: Past experience with the treatment of head and neck cancer patients showed that nearly every patient displays strong oropharyngeal adverse reactions (grade 3/4) additional to the known skin reactions (rash) caused by cetuximab. In severe cases the mucositis leads to a therapy interruption or even to a discontinuation caused by secondary local or systemic infections with associated pain symptoms. Purpose: To prevent or reduce the mucositis, we treated 72 patients starting in 2007 additionally with a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and sodium hyaluronate containing oral gel (Gelclair \u00d2 ). Materials and methods: Beginning with radiotherapy the oral gel was applied 3 times daily as a mouth rinsing solution until 4 weeks after the end of the radiotherapy. Results: In consequence we observed in all 72 patients only mild cases of mucositis. There were no specific side effects of the oral gel observed and all patients were compliant. No therapy had to be interrupted or stopped because of a severe mucositis. 7 patients had therapy interruptions or discontinuation for other reasons (e.g. rash). Conclusion: A prophylactic treatment of head and neck cancer patients receiving a combined radioimmunochemotherapy with a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and sodium hyaluronate containing oral gel should therefore be considered. Introduction/purpose: To assess the treatment outcomes and complications in the patients with oropharyngeal and oral cavity cancer treated with IMRT. Materials: Nineteen patients treated with definitive IMRT between January 2002 and December 2007 were retrospectively analyzed. Among these patients, 7 patients were treated with tomotherapy. Fourteen patients received concurrent chemotherapy. The primary site was tonsil in 8, base of tongue in 8, floor of mouth in 2 and oral tongue in 1 patient. Seventeen patients were squamous cell carcinoma and 2 patients, undifferentiated carcinoma. Thirteen patients (68.4%) had stage IV, 3 patients (15.8%) had stage III, and 3 patients (15.8%) had stage II. Methods: The median prescription dose to gross target volume was 70 (65.7-76.3) Gy, and the median daily fractional dose was 2.12 (2.12-2.35) Gy. For patients with neck node metastasis, the median involved neck dose was 59.4 (54-70) Gy. The median elective neck dose was 56.1 (51-60) Gy. The median follow-up was 29 months. Results: Three locoregional failures and 1 distant metastasis were observed. Two patients died of disease and 2 patients died of intercurrent disease. Two-year overall survival rate was 73.7%, 2-year disease-free survival rate was 78.9% and 2-year locoregional control rate was 84.2%. Late toxicities were as follows: 7 patients with grade 1 xerostomia and 2 patients with grade 2 xerostomia and 3 patients had intolerance for spicy foods. Conclusion: IMRT is effective and feasible for the patients with advanced oropharyngeal and oral cavity cancer as a definitive treatment modality without serious complications. 24/49 patients received concomitant chemotherapy. The site of the primary was: oral cavity in 19 patients, hypopharynx-larynx in 17, and oropharynx in 13. Three patients were stage II, 12 were stage III, and 32 were stage IVA. We evaluated the following risk factors: regional node involvement (pN1 = 21%, pN2a = 4%, pN2b = 38%, pN2c = 15%), extracapsular extension (35%), surgical margin status (infiltration = 31%, close = 14%). During followup, we calculated survival and disease recurrence associated with risk factors. Results: Median follow-up was 21 months (range 3-50). Overall, 21 patients died, 6/21 from disease recurrence, 2/21 from radiationrelated toxicity, and 3/21 from other causes. To date, 24/49 patients were alive and without evidence of disease (NED) and 4/49 were alive with local-regional failure. Median DFS and OS were 21 months (range 3-50). We focused on the subgroup of patients who developed failure (20/49): 11/17 patients with extracapsular extension, 6/10 were pN1, 4/7 pN2c, 9/18 pN2b, 8/15 with positive margins, and 2/7 close margins. Patients who developed local or distant recurrence were stage IVA in 16/32 cases and stage III in 4/12 cases. Primary site: hypopharynx-larynx in 8/17 and oral cavity in 8/ 19.

To calculate normal tissue complication probability (NTCP). Materials: Eleven patients, both men and women, with advanced stage cancer of the base of tongue were chosen for the study. Age range was 44-87 years, mean age 61.2 years. Dose planning was performed for IMRT with photons and IMPT with protons, the latter derived from data from the experimental scanned beam. For each patient, 9 ports of coplanar fields with 6 MV IMRT with 140 segments, step-and-shoot technique and 3 coplanar fields for 202 MeV IMPT plans were prepared. To the PTV of adjuvant volume 50 Gy in 2-Gy fractions daily was prescribed. The PTV of tumour and engaged lymph nodes was planned with 2.4-60 Gy using a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB). Target coverage was between 95 and 110% of the prescribed dose. Tolerance dose to the parotid glands was 26 Gy and to the medulla 48 Gy. The dose to the oral cavity was minimized. Dose resolution was 3 9 3 mm in transversal slices; resolution in axial direction was the same as in the CT study for each patient. NTCP for the parotid glands was calculated using LKB-model with parameters m = 0.49, TD50 = 27.8, n = 1. Results: Preliminary data showed that target coverage with IMPT seemed to be more conformal than with IMRT. Conformity indexes were found to be for PTV tot (IMRT) = 1.97(range 1.64-2.52), PTV tot (IMPT) = 1.38 (range 1.24-1.71), PTV boost (IMR-T) = 1.48(range 1.34-1.84), PTV boost (IMPT) = 1.20 (range 1.11-1.34). Using IMPT, the prescribed doses could be kept within the planned interval in all patients, while using IMRT only in 10/11 patients. The volume of the oral cavity receiving more than 30 Gy was 17% smaller in IMPT than in IMRT plans. With IMPT, the median dose to medulla was 30.2 Gy, compared to 46.1 Gy using IMRT. NTCP for parotid glands was 11-14% lower for IMPT. Conclusion: Both the conformity and the uniformity of target coverage were better with IMPT. Moreover, all OAR received lower doses with IMPT, thereby NTCP could be decreased. Using IMPT for treatment of patients with advanced cancer of the base of tongue seems to be encouraging. The purpose of this study is to estimate the late radiation reaction chosen critical tissues (salivary glands, larynx, mucosal membrane, spinal cord and skin) in patients with squamous cell cancer irradiated by conventional (3D CRT) or accelerated method (CAIR or CB). Material and methods: In 43 patients with pharyngeal and laryngeal cancer irradiated to total dose in range 62.5-72 Gy the estimation of late radiation toxicity chosen critical tissues was provided. All patients were irradiated by conventional (3D CRT) or accelerated method (CAIR or CB). The late radiation reaction was estimated after 3, 6 and every 6 months after final treatment using two systems of classification: SOMA-LENT and CTC, version 3.0. The non-parametric Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon test was used for the estimation of relationships. Results: The incidence of the late radiation toxicity was generally low for both radiation methods in two scales except salivary glands, where toxicity was higher than in other tissues (but on the similar level according to CTC and SOMA-LENT scale). We have observed the middle level of xerostomia connecting with change of amount and consistency of saliva after irradiation. The radiation doses accumulated in submandibular glands were higher than in parotids independently on method of irradiation. Conclusions: The observed late toxicity in early post-radiation follow-up is relatively low with xerostomy as the most troublesome symptom. The radiation doses accumulated in submandibular glands much exceeded threshold dose of salivary tissue in the correlation to parotids. This prospective study is being continued. Background and purpose: In this study, the impact of changes in tumor volume with the use of FDG-PET images in target volume (TV) delineation on dose distribution of Head and Neck patient (H&N) has been investigated. Materials and methods: Fifteen patients with locally advanced (T2-T4) pharyngo-laryngeal tumor of H&N were considered for this study. The prescribed dose was 70 Gy to the tumor PTV and 50 Gy to the elective PTV in 2 Gy fractions. For each patient, two inverse IMRT plans were done using tomotherapy Hi-Art System. The first plan was prepared based on CT imaging and the second based on information about target volumes derived from FDG-PET imaging. Results: The study demonstrated reduction of 35% of GTV-PET, 26% of the CTV-PET and 25% of the PTV-PET compared to CT-based TV. The changes in TVs impacted the dose distribution. In high dose region, FDG-PET radiotherapy planning, allowed to decrease the volumes that were encompassed by 90 and 95% isodose (16.4 and 15.7%, respectively). However, in low dose region there was no statistical difference between different modalities. The FDG-PET treatment plan did not result in reduction of mean dose and NTCP for homolateral and heterolateral parotid. Conclusions: In spite of GTV decrease in PET-based treatment plan, the lymph node regions that require an elective dose remains similar. This explains lack of difference in mean dose and NTCP for parotids between treatment plans. The reduction of high isodose volumes in FDG-PET-based radiotherapy may potentially improve the tolerance of treatment.

Cancer development and progression requires inactivation of tumor suppressor genes and activation of protooncogenes. Expression of these genes is in part dependant on RNA and microRNA-based mechanisms. MicroRNAs are essential regulators of diverse cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, survival, motility, invasion and morphogenesis. Several microRNAs have been functionally classified as proto-oncogenes or tumor suppressors and are aberrantly expressed in various cancers. Purpose: To harness unique microRNA alterations associated with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). To attain microRNA candidates and through functional studies understand their roles in tumorigenesis of OSCC. Strategic integration of our observations at microRNA and mRNA levels will advance the overall understanding of this disease process at the system biology level. Materials and methods: Laser capture micro-dissection was used to isolate homogenous epithelial cells from fresh frozen OSCC cases and perform microarray-based genomic analysis according to GenoExplorer microRNA Full Kit protocol. The findings were compared to those obtained from normal controls. Results: Using these tools, we performed microRNA profiling on early stage oral tongue SCC cases and matching controls. A number of microRNAs were found to be differentially expressed between tumors and normal controls. Several of these microRNAs have already been implicated in oral cancer.

Results: A total of 43 patients were identified (male 25, female 18, age range 19-82 years). Most common sites involved in malignancy were larynx, oropharynx, tongue base and nasopharynx. Fourteen patients had T4, while 12, 9 and 8 patients had T3, T2 and T1 disease, respectively. The radiotherapy (DXT) was given over 20-22 fractions (55-60 Gy). Of the 43, 32 (75%) patients experienced RIM necessitating some treatment. Commonest symptoms were odynophagia, dysphagia and dysphonia. Fifty percent (16) required hospital admission where RIM was treated with analgesia, antibiotics, antifungals, steroids, and various mouth washes. Nasogastric tube feeding was required in 18 (42%) and PEG tube was inserted in 13 (30%). Based on smoking status, the incidence of RIM was; current smokers 15/18 = 83%, ex-smokers 9/17 = 53%, non-smokers 8/8 = 100%. Conclusions: There is a high incidence of RIM causing significant morbidity in our cohort. The unexpectedly high incidence of RIM in non-smokers needs further investigation. Introduction: Tongue squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) has an increasing incidence, a high morbidity rate and a 50% 5-year survival rate. The prognosis of tongue SCC is poor as compared to SCC originating at other sites of the oral cavity, because they represent different biological subentities. It has been found that multiple genetic alterations are involved in the tumorigenetic process of tongue SCC. Among these alterations are : (a) allelic loss of chromosomes 2q, 3p, 21q (b) expression of Bag-1 protein (c) expression of p14 ARP protein (d) deletion of p53 gene at tumor interface (e) recurrent chromosomal alterations, such as i(8)(q10), i(5)(p10), del(3)(p11p12), del(5)(p11), t(1;1)(p13;q25), der (14;15)(q10;q10), are involved in the tumorigenesis of tongue SCC. We are unaware on cytogenetic reports describing t(12;14) in tongue SCC. Purpose: Cytogenetic study of SCC of the tongue. Materials: Tongue biopsy tissue was minced and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium, supplemented with antibiotics and glutamine and with 10% autologous human plasma and incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. Cells were fixed after 5-11 days of culture and analyzed following standard procedures. Twenty-five metaphases were analyzed on G-banded slides and the karyotype was described for each culture, according to the ISCN guidelines. Results: We report here on clonal t(12;14) and other random numerical chromosomal changes in a case of tongue SCC. Conclusion: The significance of t(12;14) in diagnosis or prognosis is not clear yet and should be further examined. Karyotyping of more tongue SCC cases will expand the knowledge regarding chromosomal aberrations in SCC and thus might shed light on the significance of t(12;14), shown in this study.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1328, "end": 1341, "text": "1 year (2006)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Objectives and study design:"}, {"text": "Introduction and purpose: Oral cancer, the most common subgroup of HNSCC, is a prevalent cancer worldwide. Its 5-year survival rates seldom exceed 40%. Patients are often diagnosed at advanced stages where management requires morbid treatment, and over 20% of these develop metastases within a short time or years after the initial diagnosis. Currently, the lack of specific non-invasive biomarkers hampers identification of risk factors, early detection and treatment monitoring. This study aims to identify biomarkers of early oral cancer invasion. Materials and methods: We have used a clinically relevant oral cancer tissue and serum bank from patients treated at our hospital. We established an orthotopic mouse model where the growth of human oral cancer is sustained into the tongue of RAG-2/c(c) mice with histology similar to the original human oral cancer. Moreover, we established cancer cell lines from matched normal and cancer tongue tissues. We used microarray technology for transcriptional profiling of genetic changes associated with cancer progression, as well as proteomic study (using MudPIT and LC-MS/MS) on serums from mice bearing normal, non-invasive, and invasive human oral cancer and on conditioned medium from matched cancer cells. Biological relevance of selected markers was investigated in established oral cancer cells using RNA interference approach. Results and conclusion: We identified genetic abnormalities associated with oral cancer invasiveness, as well as secreted proteins contributed by cancer cells or by the cancer tissue microenvironment, which discriminate between cancer and non-cancer tissue, or between non-invasive and invasive cancers. Biological and clinical significance of relevant biomarkers to oral cancer progression will be presented. Introduction: Metastases formation depends on the ability of tumor cells to invade basement membranes and tissue barriers in a process involving enzymes capable of degrading extracellular matrix (ECM) components. One of these enzymes is heparanase, which degrades heparan sulfate. Purpose: Examine the expression of heparanase in oral carcinomas and establish whether its extent, intensity and cellular localization can be of prognostic value in predicting the outcome of oral cancer patients. Methods: Biopsy specimens from 50 oral carcinoma patients were immunohistochemically analyzed for the expression and cellular localization of heparanase, also fresh biopsy specimens of primary carcinomas were harvested and analyzed for heparanase mRNA expression using real time RT-PCR. Results: Nuclear localization of heparanase was observed in all oral verrucous carcinomas, a very well differentiated tumor that do not metastasize, as opposed to only 28% of nuclear localization detected in oral squamous cell carcinomas. Heparanase expression level also significantly correlated with the degree of tumor differentiation. Moreover, while cytoplasmic localization of heparanase was associated with high grade carcinomas, nuclear localization of the enzyme was found primarily in low grade, well differentiated tumors. Heparanase mRNA expression was higher in cancerous tumors compared with benign tumors of the oral cavity. Conclusion: In non-metastasizing verrucous carcinomas, heparanase was expressed in the cell nucleus, as opposed to metastasizing oral squamous cell carcinomas which exhibited mostly cytoplasmic localization of the enzyme. Expression level and cellular localization of heparanase could serve as reliable predictive indicators of oral carcinoma development, metastatic potential and patient prognosis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PP196"}, {"text": "A study of seven apoptosis-related molecules in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: their interrelationship and effect on recurrence and survival Paul Goodyear 1, 2 Introduction: Apoptosis is a crucial means of balancing cell loss with cell proliferation in stable tissues. In cancer it is generally thought that a raised apoptotic rate portends a good prognosis. Non surgical treatment strategies typically aim at enhancing this process. Purpose: The aim of this study was to correlate expression of known apoptosis related molecules with prognosis in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) in an attempt to identify potential prognostic biomarkers. Materials: 190 archived formalin fixed paraffin-embedded primary SCCHN tumours and lymph node metastasis samples, with matching adjacent normal tissue. The study population included 76 patients with laryngeal cancer, 47 with hypopharyngeal cancer, 26 with oropharyngeal and 41 with oral SCC. Methods: Expression of p53, MDM2, bcl-2, BAX, survivin, hTERT and caspase was studied using immunohistochemistry. The relationship of the categorized immunohistochemical scores for all markers to recurrence and survival were investigated. Results: The median follow-up of patients in the study was 9.7 years. There was a significant association for all head and neck tumour groups to have higher levels of all the molecules of interest than normal tissue (p = 0.001). Increased expression of hTERT (p = 0.0007) and MDM2 (p = 0.012) were independently associated with recurrence at the primary site. In addition, increased expression of Survivin (p = 0.006) and low expression of caspase (p = 0.0376) independently correlated with an increase risk of neck recurrence, and elevated nuclear expression of survivin, hTERT and MDM2 were all associated with a poor prognosis (p = 0.0132, p = 0.0433 and p = 0.0355, respectively).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 154, "end": 165, "text": "Goodyear 1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 166, "end": 167, "text": "2", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PP200"}, {"text": "Introduction and purposes: Standard treatment with concomitant chemotherapy (CT) and radiotherapy (RT) for nasopharyngeal cancer has shown rates of locoregional control of 80% and has improved the rate of 5-year survival to 67-84%.

Adding induction CT may control distant metastasis. Here, we compare the results of our protocol with induction CT followed by HFRT alone with the results obtained with concomitant treatments. Materials and methods: Between October 1994 and May 2002, 46 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma were treated with HFRT. The patients with N+ or T4 lesions also received cisplatin-based induction CT (55%). Results: The patients received a mean of 3 CT cycles (range 2-5). At 5 years, the rate of progression-free survival was 66% (range 51.3-82.1%), and the global survival rate was 75.7% (range 61.9-89.5%). Conclusions: The use of HFRT in association with induction CT in patients with the greatest risk of metastasis may be as effective as concomitant CT-RT for treatment of nasopharyngeal cancer. Efforts should now concentrate on minimizing the acute and chronic toxicities. Purpose: The aim of this study was to explore the expression of Fascin and Ki67 in OSCC by tissue array analysis. Methods: Paraffin sections using tissue microarrays of 84 patients with OSCC were investigated immunohistochemically, to determine the level of expression of Fascin and Ki-67 labelling index in tumor specimens. The role of Fascin in OSCC was evaluated by correlation with clinical-pathological parameters. Results: Overexpression of Fascin was significantly associated with regional lymph node metastases (P = 0.044), advanced T stage (T1 vs. T2-4, P = 0.046) advanced tumor stage (I/II vs. III/IV, P = 0.049), Histologic grade (well vs. moderately/poorly, P = 0.018) and Ki67 (P = 0.034). In 54 tongue carcinoma overexpression of Fascin was significantly associated with muscle invasion (P = 0.002). The expression of Ki-67 was higher (P = 0.017) in tumors with poor histologic grade of differentiation. Fascin and Ki67 overexpression were all significantly associated with a poor prognosis (P \\ 0.001). Introduction: Positron emission tomography (PET) is increasingly used to accurately define the tumour extent for radiotherapy planning in a number of cancer sites including head and neck cancer. Purpose: VORTIGERN is a phase I/II trial investigating the impact of PET-CT in target volume definition and doses received by organs at risk in patients with oropharyngeal cancer being treated with Tomo-Therapy. We report our initial experience of PET-CT in staging and volume definition. Materials: A Siemens Biograph PET-CT scanner, Prosoma (Medcom) and Masterplan (Nucletron) radiotherapy applications were used in this study. Methods: Nine patients underwent a planning IV contrast enhanced CT and PET scan immobilised in the treatment position. The GTV and CTV were initially defined on the CT images alone before being outlined on the PET-CT scan. Results: In 3 cases, the PET-CT defined GTV extended outside the CT based CTV indicating a possible geographical miss when planning on CT alone. The PET-CT scan did not change the TNM staging in any patient. The mean volume of the primary tumour and nodal GTV defined with CT was 44 ml (range 4.1-101.4 ml) and 30.8 ml (range 1.1-111.1 ml), respectively, compared with 22.4 mls (range 7.3-29.4 ) and 23.6 mls (1.1-74.6 mls) when defined with PET-CT.

Salvage partial laryngectomy (PL) is an effective option for patients in whom radiotherapy fails; however, total laryngectomy (TL) is usually indicated for recurrent tumor. Purpose: To evaluate the outcome of surgical salvage for T1 or T2 squamous cell carcinoma of the glottic larynx after failure of definitive radiotherapy. Materials and methods: Fifty patients who underwent salvage surgery following primary radiotherapy for T1N0 or T2N0 glottic larynx tumors were studied prospectively between October 2002 and September 2004. The mean radiation therapy dose was 65.3 Gy (56-70). Forty patients (80%) were suitable for PL, 36 for front-lateral resection, and 4 for cricohyoidoepiglottopexy; 10 (20%) required TL. Results: No postoperative death occurred following salvage surgery, although 38% of the patients developed complications. The incidence of complications was not significantly different between the PL group and the TL group. The 5-year postoperative overall survival rates for the PL and TL groups were 83 and 80%, respectively. Of 40 patients requiring PL, 6 developed local recurrence and 1 required tracheotomy.

Open partial surgery provides long rehabilitation period for swallowing and tracheotomy is often mandatory. Objectives: To evaluate functional and carcinologic results of endoscopic laser surgery (ELS) for selective T2 glottic carcinoma. Endoscopic procedure was complete vocal cord removal with anterior commissure. Materials and methods: 22 patients with T2 glottic carcinoma treated by ELS where prospectively evaluated. Inclusion criteria where no radiologic cartilage and no important paraglottic space involvement, no subglottis involvement more than 5 mm. Extension of the tumor ventricle in 6 cases, anterior commissure in 8 cases, false vocal cord in 6 cases. Results: Any patient needed tracheotomy. Swallowing began the day after surgery.

It is frequently found in the head and neck region, where the tongue is the most commonly affected site. Involvement of the hypopharynx is exceedingly rare because, to the best of our knowledge, only nine cases have been reported in the literature. Materials and methods: We describe a granular cell tumor of the hypopharynx, of a 59-year-old patient who admitted the ENT Outpatient Department of General Hospital of Volos complaining of difficulty in swallowing the last 1 year. He reported that this difficulty was gradually getting worse during this period of time. Results: Preoperative diagnostic examination including endoscopy and CT scan was suggestive of a benign lesion arising from the posterior wall of the hypopharynx, mainly on the right side, which due to its size, caused obstructive symptoms during swallowing and also a slight stenosis of the respiratory tract. Treatment included surgical excision of the lesion under microlaryngoscopy. The histopathologic study of the specimen, supported by immunohistochemical techniques, determined the lesion to be a GCT. Conclusion: GCT should be included in the differential diagnosis of submucosal hypopharyngeal lesions. Endoscopy and radiologic imaging do not display any typical findings suggestive of the diagnosis, which can be based only on histologic findings. Radical surgical resection of the tumor is the treatment of choice because of the tendency of recurrence. Introduction: Chondrosarcoma of the larynx is a rare tumor of the upper respiratory tract that originates from cartilaginous tissue and represents the most common sarcoma of this site. The diagnosis is not always easy, the aspecificity of the symptoms, and the low degree of malignancy often causes it to be mistaken for a chondroma. Purpose: We report a case of a patient with a large chondrosarcoma of the larynx, and we provide an updated review of the literature. Materials: A 55-year-old man was examined with an 18-month history of worsening dyspnea accompanied by dysphonia. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed fixation of the right vocal cord along with a large neoformation, about 3 cm in diameter, in the right subglottic region, partially obstructing the respiratory space. CT and MRI of the neck were almost superimposable and evidenced a mass of about 3 cm in diameter, with a marked reduction in the air space. Methods: After a very difficult intubation a biopsy was taken from the neoplasm and a tracheotomy was performed. Considering the grade and size of the tumor a total laryngectomy was performed. Results: The histological report revealed a grade II chondrosarcoma. After 6 months follow up the patient showed no sings of local recurrence or distal metastasis. Conclusions: Chondrosarcoma of the larynx is a very rare malignant neoplasm. It is in fact a disease that requires accurate knowledge of the differential diagnosis and of the most appropriate therapy. Results: Total operating room time was 2 h 12 min, interval between installation and the end of the procedure was 1 h 23 min, and the duration of the procedure (incision-hemostasis) was 45 min. We kept the patient hospitalized until the 7th post-operative day, under corticoid and antibiotic therapy. He did not present any complication during this period, and no enteral feeding tube was needed. Early swallowing/speech exercises were initiated on the 3rd postoperative day and hospital discharge was made after complete oral feeding reestablishment. Conclusion: Robotic systems are becoming great allies of the surgeons in treatment of benign and malignant diseases, including the carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract. The development of their integration in the surgical armamentarium is increasing fast.

Purpose: To determine the incidence of thyroid gland (TG) invasion in patients undergoing TL or TPL with TThy or HThy for advanced laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancer and to assess predicative factors. Materials and methods: Retrospective analysis of 35 patients from 2004 to 2008. Specimens were examined to determine the incidence of TG invasion and relevant predicative factors such as histological grade and subglottic extension. Pre-operative imaging was reviewed to assess for radiological evidence of TG invasion. Results: TL and TThy were performed in 19 patients, TL and HThy was performed in 3 patients and PL and TThy was performed in 13 patients. Surgery was performed for primary and recurrent cancer in 28 and 8 patients, respectively. Histological evidence of invasion of the TG was found in 3 patients (8.5%). No significant relationship was found between TG invasion and patient's sex, subsite of primary carcinoma, stage of primary disease at surgery, degree of differentiation and the presence of subglottic extension. A trend was found between the presence of TG invasion and surgery for recurrent disease. Definite evidence of radiological invasion of the TG was seen in only one patient. Conclusion: Invasion of the TG in patients undergoing a TL or TPL is a rare event and limits the need for a TThy in most cases.

Pearson correlation analysis was used to associate stomal size with these factors as well as independent t test, one-way analysis of variance and Spearman Rank Correlation was utilized to correlate stomal size with functional ability, quality of life and tumor stage. A p B 0.05 was considered significant. Results: No significance among the demographic characteristics like age and gender, anthropometic measurements, co-morbidities such as COPD, diabetes and goiter and clinical findings like pre-operative tumor site and stage, history of airway obstruction and tracheostomy, neck dissection, and pathologic resection.

Materials and methods: To 9 patients with malignant locally advanced laryngopharyngeal tumors (age 40-55). Tumors were located in laryngopharynx (8 pts), and neck soft tissues (1 pts). The predominant histological type was squamous-cell carcinoma. In the primary tumors group there were 7 patients with T4 and 1 patient with T2 (sarcoma neck soft tissues) tumors; 3 patients had N1disease. In all cases patients presented with significant cosmetic and functional defects of the upper digestive and respiratory tracts. Reconstruction pharynx was carried out with use of microsurgical flaps: gastro-omental (3), colon-omental (5) and radial flap (1). In 6 cases in one stage with pharyngolaryngectomy was performed trachea-esophageal shunting with establishing voice protez to rehabilitate the voice. The second step voice rehabilitation has been executed at 3 patients. Results: Necrosis of the flap was not. Good functional qualities of the transplant contributed to the complete healing of salivary fistulas in 2 patients. Natural food intake was restored in all patients. All patients were dacanulates within 3 weeks after surgery. In 8 cases a voice function was applied after trachea-esophageal shunting. One patient died in the postoperative period because of arrosive bleeding from mediastinal vessels. Discussion: Use of a method of microsurgical reconstruction after pharyngolaryngectomy at oncological patients promotes full restoration of a feed through a mouth and to restoration of voice function.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PP217"}, {"text": "Purpose: To raise awareness about this rare clinical entity, highlight the difficulty to diagnose this condition pre-operatively, discuss the management options and to investigate any association between patients' factors and occurrence of this complication. Materials: Case report with world literature review. Methods: Two Caucasian males completed DXT for their early stage squamous cell carcinoma of larynx. They had a good response and remained disease free, clinically and radiologically. The two case reports are described in detail and a review of the literature addressing various aspects of chondroradionecrosis of the larynx will be presented. Results: Within the first year of completing DXT, they developed painful throat, persistent dysphonia and dysphagia. Multiple laryngeal biopsies failed to reveal any malignancy but showed evidence of radionecrosis. They failed to improve with conservative treatment. Because of the severity of their symptomatology, non-functioning larynges and possibility of occult malignancy, they had salvage laryngectomy with good post-operative recovery. The final pathology did not reveal any residual/recurrent tumour but confirmed chondroradionecrosis. Conclusions: Chondroradionecrosis of the larynx is an extremely difficult condition to treat and every effort should be made to prevent this complication. This possible side effect should be thoroughly explained to the patients while counseling them for DXT to treat their laryngeal cancer. Introduction: Laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers are among the most frequent ENT malignancies. The hypothesis that reactive oxygen species play a role in carcinogenesis has gained support from a large number of studies. Purpose: To evaluate the oxidative stress parameters in patients with advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers. Materials and methods: The research was carried out on a group of 57 patients, and compared to a control group of 30 healthy subjects. Blood was harvested from the 57 patients, the day before, or the morning before surgery (test 1). The second blood test for the same patient was harvested two weeks after the surgery (test 2). From the serum tests 1 and 2, the following determinations were made: carbonilated protein (PC), hydrogen donor capacity (DH), free malone dialdehyde (MDA) and lipid peroxides (PL). Results: The values of the final lipid and protein peroxidation products are at significantly higher levels in the serum of patients as compared to the healthy controls. The total antioxidant capacity is significantly diminished in the serum of patients compared with healthy controls. The radical surgery determines a significant decrease of the final products of protein and lipid peroxidation, associated with a significant increase of the antioxidant capacity. Conclusions: The data obtained confirm a characteristic oxidative pattern in patients with laryngeal and hypopharyngeal carcinoma (high values of lipid and protein peroxidation products, associated with a decrease of total antioxidant capacity). Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is considered to progress from dysplasia to invasive cancer through well-defined clinical and histological stages. Numerous genetic alterations have been described in LSCC, but the molecular mechanisms contributing to its initiation and to the progression from a normal cell to invasive carcinoma are still poorly known. Genomic, transcriptomic and protein alterations in LSCC progression are key areas for the current research aiming at finding instruments for classification, prognostication and patient tailored treatment. High-resolution genome-wide technologies have revealed numerous genetic alterations (both gene amplifications and deletions) that still have an unestablished correlation with gene expression and molecular consequences. A review of the current literature on the use of novel array-based technologies in revealing the molecular portrait of laryngeal cancer will be presented. Methods: This is a retrospective and prospective study conducted at cases with laryngeal cancer. Results: Out of 404 laryngectomies, in 130 (31.17%) was performed partial laryngectomy. VPL was performed in 98/130 (75.38%) and in 32/130 (24.61%) HPL. Out of 130 VPL in 52 (53.06%) cases was performed Chordectomy, in 6/98 (6.12%) fronto-lateral laryngectomy, in 8/98 (8.16%) cases was applied hemilaryngectomy and 32/98 (32.65%) were treated with classic VPL. Only HPL was conducted in 29/32 (90.62%) cases and in 3/32 (9.37%) cases HPL mutually with partial pharyngectomy. In cases treated with Chordectomy, VPL and HPL laryngeal functions were reset at the end of the first week and in most cases laryngeal functions were satisfying. Conclusions: Larynx conservative surgery intends to preserve speaking and swallowing functions with no need of permanent tracheostoma. Open techniques result with a better rate of local control, but tracheotomy is requested.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PP217"}, {"text": "Laryngeal cancer: a 6-year experience in our clinic Maria Apostolidou, Eleftheria Gletsou, Evaggelos Theos, Constantinos Evaggelopoulos, Constantinos Gantas, Evdoxia Gerostergiou, Vasileios Lachanas, John Bizakis Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Department, University of Thessaly, School of Medicine, Larissa, Greece Introduction: Laryngeal cancer is the most common non-cutaneous head and neck malignancy. For classification purposes, it is divided into supraglottic, glottic and subglottic tumors. Symptoms and treatment vary according to the classification and the tumor stage. The early diagnosis is significant for the patient's prognosis. Purpore: To investigate the outcome of surgically managed laryngeal carcinoma patients attending an outpatient clinic over a 6-year period from 2003 until today. Materials: This was an analytical, retrospective, cross-sectional study. A total of 181 laryngeal carcinoma patients who were managed surgically with or without radiotherapy were analyzed. Methods: They were classified according to age, sex, risk factors, location, size and degree of invasion of the tumor, the histological type and the treatment. Results: They were 174 male and 7 female patients, who were divided into three groups according to their age: those who were younger than 45 years old, those who were between 45 and 65 years old and those who were older than 65 years old. Conclusions: Laryngeal cancer is mainly a disease of middle-aged and elderly men. Tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption have been established as the main risk factors for laryngeal cancer. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is by far the most common histological finding in laryngeal malignancy. Methods: This is a retrospective review over a period of 10 years from January 1998 to December 2007 at the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Center (UKMMC), Kuala Lumpur. Case records of patients who had carcinoma of larynx during this period were reviewed. For survival analysis, TNM classifications was used by creating alternative groupings; early-localized disease (ELD) (T1-2, N0, M0), advanced-localized disease (ALD) (T3-4, N0, M0), and regional metastasis (RM) (T1-4, N [ 0, M0). National registry department provided the survival status of the patients. Results: Fifty cases were reviewed, 46 males and 4 females with a ratio of 11.5:1, age between 33 and 81 years old with median age of 64.4. Main complaints were hoarseness, hoarseness with stridor and hoarseness with neck nodes. Mean duration of complaints was 9.6 months. Mean duration from presentation to diagnosis (HPE) was 30.3 days. Mean duration from diagnosis to radiotherapy was 47.1 days and for surgery was 25 days. Twelve patients had tracheostomy performed prior to laryngectomy. Median duration from tracheostomy to definitive surgery was 28.5 days. Out of the 12 patients, 1 patient had stomal recurrence. Mean duration of follow up was 3.9 years. Eighteen patients had undergone total laryngectomy: 2 patients had primary tracheo-esophageal prosthesis (TEP) insertion, 11 patients had secondary TEP insertion, 1 patient had acquired esophageal speech and 4 patients had no voice rehabilitation. Recurrence rate for ELD and ALD were similar at 25% and for RM at 28%. Mean duration to develop recurrence was 13.1 months. Overall 5 years survival rate was 48.9, 75% for ELD, 44.4% for ELD and 27.3% for RM. Conclusion: There was delay in starting the definitive treatment either by radiotherapy or surgery because of late presentation of patients. The duration of tracheostomy and the definitive surgery was far from ideal but the incidence of stomal recurrence was low. The survival rate for the ELD group was similar to other studies but for the ALD and RM, the survival rate in this review was lower. Introduction: Incidence rates of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) have been on the increase in several countries in recent decades, with contrasting trends observed in neighboring anatomical sites. Earlier epidemiological studies indicate that they share important risk factors, including tobacco and alcohol, while a subset of more recently diagnosed cancers may be associated with oncogenic HPV types. Purpose: To examine incidence trends in pharyngeal SCCs in Norway, and to study whether changes in disease classification systems, coding and registration practices, rather than real changes in incidence, may explain the observations. Materials: Incident cases of pharyngeal cancer were extracted from The Cancer Registry of Norway for the period 1981-2005 (n = 2,315), including base of tongue (n = 333), oropharynx (n = 999), nasopharynx (n = 263) and hypopharynx (n = 720). Methods: Clinical notifications for each case were abstracted and the primary site revised. Incidence counts and rates were examined before and after reabstraction, as were trends in the revised age-adjusted rates, as well as birth cohort trends, by subsite and sex. Results: Recoding had little impact on rates or the direction and magnitude of trends by subsite or sex. Oropharyngeal SCC incidence rates were three times higher in men, with rapid annual increases in both sexes from 1981 to 2005 of 5.0% (men) and 4.2% (women). Incidence rates of cancer of the base of tongue increased in both men and women, approaching 4 and 3% annual increases. Rates of hypopharyngeal cancer declined in men in recent years, but increased in women. Trends in oropharyngeal cancer paralleled lung cancer in women, but not in men. Conclusions: The observed increases in incidence in oropharyngeal SCCs appear to be real. Traditional risk factors are not likely to explain trend for males, as they differ temporally with those of hypopharyngeal and lung cancer incidence.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 52, "end": 212, "text": "Maria Apostolidou, Eleftheria Gletsou, Evaggelos Theos, Constantinos Evaggelopoulos, Constantinos Gantas, Evdoxia Gerostergiou, Vasileios Lachanas, John Bizakis", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PP223"}, {"text": "TNM staging of nasopharyngeal carcinoma as a prognostic factor: a single institution experience Claramae Chia, Gopalakrishna Iyer Department of General Surgery, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore Nasopharyngeal carcinoma has a high incidence in Southern China and Southeast Asia.

Result: Among 13 patients, vocal cord mobility was recovered in 8 patients (61.5%), but not recovered in 5 patients (38.5%). All patient with no recovery experienced local recur or progression of disease during treatment and died within 3 years after primary treatment. Age (over than 60 years old), T-stage 4, primary site (hypopharynx), positive neck node and cell differentiation (poorly) showed the trend of poor prognosis, but statistically not significant due to small number of patients. Return of mobility showed statistically significant good prognosis. Conclusion: Return of vocal cord mobility after chemoradiation may be highly predictive factor for good prognosis. And failure to return of vocal cord mobility means to requirement for early changing of the treatment modality. Introduction: Recent developments in endoscopic diagnosis have enabled gastrointestinal endoscopists to detect hypopharyngeal carcinoma in an early stage. Patients with such early lesions can be treated with endoscopic resection (ER) with minimal invasiveness. However, strict indication for ER in cases of hypopharyngeal carcinoma is unclear. In this study, we evaluated long-term outcome after ER in patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma invading the upper subepithelial layer. Methods: From June 2003 through March 2008, 17 patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma underwent ER at Hokkaido University Hospital. Nine of the patients had histologically confirmed shallow invasion of the subepithelium. None of those 9 patients wished to undergo open surgery or adjuvant chemoradiotherapy, and they were observed to assess the outcome. Lesion size ranged from 0.9 to 2.5 cm [mean (SD), 2.0 \u00b1 0.5 cm]. Depth of tumor invasion in the subepithelium ranged from 300 to 720 lm [mean (SD), 480 \u00b1 150 lm]. Results: As of March 2009, none of the 9 patients have died of recurrent hypopharyngeal carcinoma or intercurrent diseases. None of them have had local recurrence or metastasis. The median follow-up period after treatment in the 9 patients was 43 months (12-66 months). Kaplan-Meier estimates of relapse-free survival rates at 5 years in the 9 patients were 100%.

In most cases combine radiotherapy and chemotherapy enable to achieve complete response in primary tumor and perform surgery only in regional lymph nodes. Patients and methods: A total of 130 patients with T1-4 and N1-3 pharynx cancer were analyzed (nasopharynx cancer n = 28; oropharynx cancer n = 49; hypopharynx cancer n = 53). The patients with complete regression in primary tumor were included in analysis. T3-T4 and T2 stage was obtained in 88 patients (67.7%) and 42 patients (32.3%), respectively. N2-N3 and N1 stage was obtained in 103 patients (79.2%) and in 27 patients (20.8%), respectively. Initial chemoradiotherapy was consisted in two cycles of chemotherapy with 5-FU and cisplatin with concomitant radiation therapy to primary tumor and neck-supraclavicular lymph nodes on both sides with dose 40 Gy (2 Gy per fraction). Once clinical response assessed as shrinking of primary tumor more than 50%, and was acquired than radiotherapy was consecutive escalated to 70 Gy. Results: In all patients, complete response in primary tumor was achieved due to radical course of radiotherapy (70 Gy). Complete response in N1 and N2-3 stage was obtained in 23 patients (85.2%) and in 28 patients (27.2%), respectively. Partial response rate in N1 and N2-3 stage was 14.8% (n = 4) and 72.8% (n = 75), respectively. Of all patients in this group lymphodissection for regional nodes was performed.

Tonsillar carcinoma is the third most common, with an incidence of 18-47% of unknown primaries, and the likelihood of synchronous tonsillar tumour of about 5-10%. Current practice for investigating an unknown primary includes computed tomography (CT) with or without magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and then, if necessary, 18-fluouro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). This is followed by panendoscopy with biopsy from the potential primary sites including tonsillar biopsy or tonsillectomy.

Materials: All patients within a 5-year period presenting with metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with an unknown primary. Results: A 5-year retrospective review of our database of metastatic squamous cell carcinomas from unknown primary sites identified five patients with synchronous tonsillar tumours.

The most common invasion site is recurrent laryngeal nerve and larynx. Usually total thyroidectomy may be combined with radical procedure that includes laryngectomy, pharyngectomy or conservative procedure including tracheal shaving.

Introduction: Syndecan-1 (SDC-1) is a member of the transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which are involved in cell-cell adhesion and the interaction of cells with the extracellular matrix. Evidence suggests that loss of SDC-1 expression in several benign and malignant epithelial neoplasms is an unfavorable prognostic indicator, but its expression profile in thyroid gland neoplasms remains to be elucidated. Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate SDC-1 expression in thyroid papillary carcinomas (TPC) that were both larger and smaller than 10 mm with or without extracapsular extension (TPC-E and TPC-NE). Materials and methods: The expression of SDC-1 was studied in 62 cases of TPC-E and TPC-NE using a tissue microarrays technique (TMA). SDC-1 positivity was predominantly observed in the cytoplasm of neoplastic epithelial cells and in the stroma of the TPC. Results: SDC-1 is expressed in both neoplastic epithelial cells and the stroma. It is more frequently expressed in TPC-E than TPC-NE (p \\ 0.05) and the stromal expression of SDC-1 is more intense in TPC-E that are [10 mm (p \\ 0.05). Conclusions: The epithelial and stromal expression of SDC-1 observed in this series of TPC suggests that the expression of this protein may be related to extracapsular invasion. Background: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are known to control tissue remodeling and neoangiogenesis that is crucial to accelerated tumor growth, whereas plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE-1). Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess certain functional gene variants controlling production and activation of MMPs among the patients, searching for associations between certain gene variants and tumor growth and dissemination. Methods: The study included 109 patients with papillary thyroid cancer. Genomic DNA for molecular biology assays was extracted from blood leukocytes, using a sorbent method. Genotyping was performed for promoter alleles of MMP-1 (1G/2G -1607 ), MMP-3 (5A/6A -600 ), PAI-1 (4G/5G -675 ), using allele-specific PCR approach. A well-known I/D polymorphism of ACE-1 gene were assayed by a gene-specific PCR. Results: We found association between earlier age of disease, and 5A allele of gene, i.e., the mean age of PTC manifestation was 48 versus 59 years for the patients, resp., with and without MMP3 5A genotype (p \\ 0.01). Hyperactive variant 2G of MMP-1 gene is associated with decreased risk of metastases (59% among 2G-positive cases vs. 82% of 2G-negative patients) the patients of all ages.

Materials and methods: This is a prospective case series study done in National Cancer Institute from April 2000 to May 2009. During this period, we followed 45 cases of hyperparathyroidism (HPT) presented with main complaint of bone tumor whether primary, single or multiple osteolytic bone lesions, maxillary swelling, mandibular swelling or multiple vertebral body osteolytic lesions. We started by clinical evaluation, laboratory investigations and radiological investigations. For preoperative localization, neck ultrasound, Tc99m Sestamibi scan, CT or MRI neck and superior mediastinum were done. Intraoperative ultrasound was used in some cases. Postoperative bone densitometry and plain X-ray were done to follow-up bone mineral deposition Results: We had 39 females (86.6%) and 6 male patients (13.4%) with age range 18\u00e3 70\u00f4years with mean\u00f4=\u00f444. Preoperative diagnosis was 36/45 (80%) cases of primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT), 7/45 (15.5%) cases of secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT), and 2/45 (4.5%) tertiary hyperparathyroidism (tHPT). Single benign adenoma was found in 33/45 (73.3%), diffuse hyperplasia in 4/45 cases (8.8%) and one case parathyroid carcinoma (2.2%). Neck ultrasound could localize 29 adenoma (29/38) (sensitivity of 73.3%), Sestamibi could localize 23/38 including another two cases of diffuse hyperplasia not detected by ultrasound (sensitivity of 63.8%). Total preoperative localization was 32/38 (84.2%). Intra-operative ultrasound was useful in detection of two cases in the thyroid gland. Intra-operative parathormone after 15 min dropped in 100% of cases. Recurrence of the disease occurred in 2/38 cases during follow up (5.2%). Postoperative hypocalcaemia in severe form occurred in four cases that needed longer hospitalization and longer period of oral calcium. Healing in cortical bone was faster than cancellous bone. Conclusion: Diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism should be suspected in all cases with bone tumor-like presentation or even in earlier disease complaint of bony or muscle aches. Serum PTH and calcium (total and ionic), renal functions, 24 h urine calcium, neck ultrasonography, and Tc99m pertechnitate/Tc99m sestsmibi subtraction scan can establish the diagnosis and differentiate clinical entities. Surgical treatment with unilateral or bilateral neck exploration.

Since overexpression of EGFR and its ligand transforming growth factor alpha (TGFa) was detected in microscopically normal mucosa of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients, this alteration is believed to be an early event in multistep field cancerization. Presuming the overexpression of both proteins long before cancer diagnosis, our study evaluates the influence of EGFR-signalling on the process of chemical carcinogenesis. Materials and methods: Mini-organ cultures (MOC) of oropharyngeal mucosa close to negative resection margins were cultured. MOC were then stimulated with TGFa with and without prior EGFR-blockade by cetuximab, before DNA damage was induced using the metabollicaly activated carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE). DNA damage was quantified by the alkaline single cell microgel electrophoresis (Comet Assay). Results: In MOC of HNSCC patients, TGFa-stimulation led to a decrease of resulting DNA damage by 30.4% (n = 15; p \\ 0.001). Pretreatment with cetuximab abrogated this effect, whereas in controls no significant change of DNA damage was detected. Conclusion: Our results show a strong DNA stabilizing effect of EGFR-signalling in cases. As similar results were obtained using cisplatin in place of BPDE, our study confirms the usage of cetuximab in combination with cytotoxic drugs for the treatment of locally advanced HNSCC. Furthermore, overexpression of EGFR and TGFa in early stages of carcinogenesis might be seen as a physiological reaction on carcinogen impact.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 95, "end": 164, "text": "Philipp Baumeister, Christian Welz, Maximilian Reiter, Ulrich Harr\u00e9us", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PP244"}, {"text": "Detection of serum level of human epithelial growth factor receptor-2 in patient with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma Bijan Khademi, Abbas Ghadri, Seyyed Fakhroddin Hosseini Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz Institute for Cancer Research, Shiraz, Iran", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PP245"}, {"text": "Background: The role of HER-2 has been shown to be a prognostic factor in many kinds of cancers, but in HNSCC is not still defined.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PP245"}, {"text": "The purpose of the current study is the investigation of the role of HER-2 in HNSCC and it's correlations to various clinicopathologic parameters.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PP245"}, {"text": "Proteomic and transcriptomal identification of the mechanisms and consequences of P53 gain of function mutation in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma Anna Behrandt 1 , Bryony Lloyd 1 , D.

Boyd 1 1 School of Cancer Studies, The University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK, 2 Department of Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery, Aintree University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Liverpool, UK Introduction: Recent studies show that oncogenic gain-of-function (GOF) p53 mutations promote poorer prognosis and therapeutic response in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHN). GOF mutants likely act through altered transcriptional activity and/or novel protein-protein interactions. To characterise these, we have performed both proteomic and transcriptomic analyses of two GOF mutants representing two distinct mutational classes; structural (p53 R175H) and contact (p53 R273H). We have focused on the most common sub-type of SCCHNs: laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). Purpose: Identify the mechanism/s by which p53 GOF mutants promote disease progression. Materials: LSCC cell lines of defined p53 status engineered to express mutant p53. Methods: Tandem affinity chromatography, mass spectrometry and Affymetrix TM -exon-array analyses. Real-time motility assays of cells. Results: As expected, p53 GOF mutants display dominant-negative transcriptional activity. Mutant expressing cells also display increased motility-linking mutant expression with metastatic potential. Known p53-interacting proteins, such as MDM2 have been identified in the purified complexes containing mutant p53, thus validating the experimental system. Complexes have been subjected to mass spectrometry for identification. Exon array analyses have been performed on p53-null LSCC cells c.f. mutant p53 expressing cells and the transcriptomes of these cells are being analysed. These results will be presented. Conclusions: GOF mutant p53 promotes carcinogenesis through as yet poorly defined mechanisms. We have used proteomic and transcriptomic analyses to define the mechanism/s involved in this. Since p53 GOF mutants are typically linked with poor prognosis, identification of these mechanisms may reveal important new therapeutic targets. Introduction: The behavior of a small squamous cell carcinoma of oral tongue can be unpredictable. Histopathologically only the grading system seems to have any predictive diagnostic value but it is unreliable. It would be beneficial to find prognostic markers to better adjust the treatment and survey of this cancer. The oncogene c-Myc controls cell proliferation and apoptosis, and Snail regulates epithelial to mesenchyme transition and is involved in metastatic formation. The expression of these markers has been connected with prognosis in many cancer types. Purpose: C-Myc and Snail were studied in oral tongue carcinoma patients in order to reveal a possible prognostic value of these markers. Materials: Our material consisted of 73 oral tongue carcinoma patients (T1-2/N0/M0) treated at the Helsinki University Central Hospital between 1992 and 2002. Methods: Tissue array blocks were prepared from the tumor samples and immunopositivity of c-Myc and Snail were compared with clinical and histopathological parameters: degree of histological differentiation, tumor size, TNM stage, depth of invasion, and status of resection margins. In addition, survival analyses were performed comparing disease-free survival time with the registered protein expression of the markers mentioned above. Results: Snail expression correlated with histopathological grade (Fisher's exact test p = 0.007) and invasion depth of the tumors (v 2 -test, p = 0.037). Snail and c-Myc expressions did not correlate with prognosis. Conclusions: The high Snail expression seems to predict invasion pattern and histopathological status of oral tongue carcinoma and might help in classification of these tumors. Introduction: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide. Despite considerable advances in surgical and oncological treatment over the past two decades, overall disease outcome has improved only slightly. The main reason is late diagnosis of cancer. For better prognosis of patients, it is crucial to recognize the cancer in early stage. Purpose: The aim of our project is identification of potential biomarkers involved in the process of cancerogenesis of HNSCC based on cDNA microarray analysis. Materials and methods: Three snap-frozen samples were taken from 39 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas in different clinical stages. RNA was isolated from tumour tissue, adjacent tissue and normal contralateral mucous membrane. High quality RNA (RIN [ 8) was further amplified and hybridized at cDNA microarrays (Illumina WG 6 v3). Results: We detected 1,500 differentially expressed transcripts between tumours and matched normal tissues. In particular, we observed genes related to extracellular matrix (ECM) or its remodelling (collagens, keratins and matrix metalloproteinases), specific chemokines and cytokines and several already known HNSCC-associated transcripts (PLAU, CRNN, MAL, SPINK5). We detected the following KEGG pathways as over-represented: DNA replication, cell cycle, cytokine-cytokine interaction, p53, toll-like and Jak-STAT signalling pathways and ECM remodelling. The overall metabolism was down-regulated in the tumours. Conclusions: The presented data of large-cohort whole-genome transcription profiling of patient-matched samples reveal several marker genes distinguishing tumour and normal tissues. According to clustering analysis we further can distinguish keratinising and nonkeratinising tumours as two separate clusters.

Introduction: Endoglin (CD105) is a powerful marker of neovascularization and D2-40 is a new indicator for identifying of lymphatic vessels. The densities of blood and lymphatic vessels have been showed that are useful in prediction of behavior of malignant tumors. Aim: In this study, we evaluated the expression of CD105 and D2-40 in the squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the tongue and their correlation with lymph node metastasis and other clinicopathologic factors. Methods: 40 patients with primary tongue SCC were selected. Microvessel and lymphatic vessel densities were determined in all cases by CD105 and D2-40 immunostaining. The relation between micro vessel density and lymphatic vessel density with lymph node involvement and other clinicopathologic factors including age, sex and histologic grading were tested statistically. Results: In all cases, CD105 and D2-40 expression were significantly higher in neoplastic tissue than peripheral normal ones. Also, CD105 and D2-40 expression in invasive front and intratumoral areas of the tumors with lymph node metastasis were significantly higher (p \\ 0.05) than the tumors without lymph node involvement.

Purpose: In this study, we synthesized water-soluble and biocompatible QDs nanospheres and investigated its availability for in vivo imaging. Materials and methods: Luminescent Near-IR CdTe/CdSe QDs were synthesized and encapsulated in PLGA nanospheres to prepare watersoluble and biocompatible QDs nanospheres. QDs were encapsulated with PLGA nanospheres by a solid dispersion method and optimized to have high fluorescence intensity for in vivo imaging detection. The resultant PLGA nanospheres with QDs were characterized by various analytical techniques such as UV-vis measurement, light scattering, fluorescence spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic forced microscopy (AFM). Finally, we also evaluated toxicity and body distribution of QDs loaded in PLGA nanospheres in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Results: The QDs loaded in PLGA nanospheres were spherical and showed a diameter range of 100-150 nm in size. The QD nanospheres increased their stability against photooxidation and photobleaching, which have the high potential for applications in biomedical imaging and detection. We have also attained noninvasive in vivo imaging with light photons represents an intriguing avenue for obtaining biological information by the use of Near-IR light. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the potential applications of QDs loaded in PLGA nanospheres for the detection of disease including tumors using in vivo imaging method. Objective: To investigate the effect of celecoxib on adhesion, invasion, migration and MMP-2 expression of tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line Tca8113 cells. Methods: Following 24-h incubation with celecoxib, the Tca8113 cells were detected for cell adhesion and migration using cell adhesion assay and Boyden chamber invasion assay. The expression of Cox-2 protein in Tca8113 cells was detected with SP immunohistochemistry staining. The MMP-2 level in supernatant was detected with ELISA. Results: The adhesion and Boyden chamber invasion assays showed that, after treatment with celecoxib, the ability of adhesion and migration of Tca8113 cells was significantly inhibited (P \\ 0.01). Celecoxib could decrease the expression of Cox-2 protein in Tca8113 cell and decrease the MMP-2 level in supernatant (P \\ 0.01). Conclusion: Cox-2 inhibitor celecoxib significantly inhibit the adhesion and migration of Tca8113 cells. The inhibitory effect on adhesion and migration may be correlative with its effect on decrese of Cox-2 protein expression and secretion of MMP-2 in of Tca8113 cell. Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC); OPSCC is one of the most serious malignancies worldwide. Therefore, it attracts the attention of research institutes to develop different diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. However, the full image of this neoplasm is not yet completed. Based on studies on other tissues we assume that these epithelial tumor cells themselves not only influence the behavior of its surrounding stroma but also can actively synthesize their stroma; through which they could be able to develop their unique environment that can maintain their needs and hinder body immune mechanisms. Our aim is to elucidate that mechanism, and characterize the origin of OPSCC tumor induced stromata. Such specification of TIS can play a role in develop new strategy of SCC prognosis and treatment. To achieve our objective, our OPSCC archived cases (well, moderately, and poorly differentiating carcinomas, 30 cases for each) including primary and recurrent/metastatic lesions were subjected to immunohistochemical staining for extracellular molecules of interest [Tenascin and Heparan sulphate proteoglycan (HSPG)], endothelial cell markers (CD31 and CD34), and proliferative molecules (cyclin D1 and Ki 67).

We audited the consent given to the patients prior to ENT operations in Queen's Hospital 9UK). The consent procedure is carried out by junior staff in Pre-Admission clinics. Some of the staff are new to the field of ENT. Purpose: The consenting procedure in busy ENT departments are more frequently carried out by the most junior members of the team some of whom have no background knowledge of ENT. The purpose of the study was to evaluate how accurate where the consent procedure carried out by the junior staff. Materials: We analyzed the quality of the consents form completed by the senior house officers for 3 months retrospectively. The template used, was the adverse side effect mentioned by ENT UK. The most common procedures consented were analysed. We provided posters and guidelines in the pre-admission clinics and audited the quality of consent forms for 3 months. Results: We compared the most common procedures consented by the junior staff pre-and post-intervention. The difference was staggering. There was 99% compliance with the guidelines. Conclusion: Consenting is a crucial part of every procedure. The importance of informed consent cannot be overlooked as the patient Autonomy is at stake. As the demand on NHS is growing in terms of time and productivity, consenting is left to the juniors who are frequently not trained the field. Basic teaching and visual aid, in terms of posters in Admission office can greatly improve the quality of consents and reduce the possibility of future litigations. 14 patients had frontolateral partial laryngectomy, 3 patients had supracricoid partial laryngectomy with CHEP, 9 patients had horizotal laryngectomy according to Calearo.

Nutritional support via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube can be associated with significant complications such as local site infection, leakage and intra-abdominal sepsis. Purpose: To determine the rate of PEG tube dependence in our institution, as well as factors predictive of prolonged PEG tube usage.Conclusion: Age and BMI appear to be predictors of prolonged PEG use. This knowledge may aid clinicians and dieticians in the management of SCCHN patients requiring nutritional support via PEG tubes. Nutritional protocol was well tolerated. No significative weight changes were recorded. Post-operating recovery of late proteic synthesis indexes is related to persistence of inflammatory activation. A higher proteic production is associated with an earlier recovery with lower rate of local and systemic complications.Introduction: Refeeding Syndrome (RfS) may result following the reestablishment of feeding in malnourished individuals. RfS has multisystem consequences and an associated mortality rate. Head and neck cancer patients are at risk of RfS due to their often poor nutritional status and co-morbidities. Purpose: To identify the prevalence of RfS risk in patients being treated for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Blood samples were obtained prior to cancer treatment. S-25-OHD and plasma Ca and Pi were measured by standard methods. S-25-OHD \\50 nmol/L was defined as hypovitaminosis and values \\20 mmol/L as vitamin D deficiency. Results: The mean (SD) S-25-OHD was 41.9 (22) nmol/L. Vitamin D hypovitaminosis was found in 64% and deficiency in 16% of the patients. Two patients had extreme vitamin D deficiency with values \\10 nmol/L. No seasonal variation was observed. There were no statistically significant differences in vitamin D concentrations between the genders. Subnormal plasma Ca levels were found in 11% and low Pi levels in 9% of patients. Conclusions: Subnormal vitamin D levels were found in a significant proportion of the patients already prior to treatment. Since vitamin D deficiency may pose these patients to increased risk of therapy-related morbidity, special attention should be paid to correction of nutritional deficiencies. The aims of our study are to determine the incidence of clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism in those who have been treated solely with curative radiotherapy for early laryngeal cancer. Materials: All patients who underwent curative radiotherapy for T1/ T2 laryngeal cancer between 1998 and 2002 were identified. Methods: We performed a retrospective observational study. To evaluate the differences between the objective determination of postoperative speech and swallowing by a speech pathologist and a surgeon and the patient's subjective assessment for different reconstruction techniques after tumor surgery. Materials and methods: 40 patients at least 1 year after tumor surgery of the tongue and the lower jaw region were asked to fill in the EORTC QLQ C30 and H&N35 questionnaires. A surgeon determined speech and swallowing semiquantitatively and a speech pathologist used the Frenchay dysarthria examination. The reconstruction groups were divided in the following manner: laser-resection, myocutaneous flaps, fasciocutaneous, and osteomyocutaneous flaps.Results and conclusions: The best subjective and objective results were obtained for laser resections, the second best results for thin fasciocutaneous transplants. Pedicled myocutaneous transplants were partly better rated than osteomyocutaneous flaps. The assessment of the patient and the speech pathologist for speech were similar. Laserresections were rated too positive from the surgeons. Swallowing was significantly reduced for all reconstruction techniques. The discrepancies in the assessment of swallowing between patient and surgeon were remarkable. The neuromuscular coordination of swallowing cannot be improved-independent of the reconstruction techniques. The laser penetrates gloves, double gloves and endotracheal cuffs in less than 1 s at 2 W. Time to penetrate a size 6.0 endotracheal tube at 2 W continuous setting increased from\\1 s at 90\u00b0to 42 s at 45\u00b0.

This causes significant postoperative flap morbidities. Other variables such as age, smoking and previous radiotherapy had no impact on morbidity. Thus, hypothermia is an independent risk factor for the development of postoperative morbidity in patients undergoing flap reconstruction for head and neck cancers. Presentation of our experience in tracheostomy performed on various oncological patients in our hospital. Materials: In Theageneion Hospital, we perform about 50 tracheostomies per year, not only on ENT patients, but also on patients of maxillofacial surgery department, who suffer from tongue or maxillar cancer. Methods: Tracheostomy is classified to emergency, surgical and percutaneous tracheostomy. Emergency tracheostomy is performed under local anesthesia. A vertical incision is made, thyroid gland is recognised and its isthmus is either moved or cut. An incision is made to the anterior wall of trachea, and the tracheostomy tube is inserted so that the patient can be ventilated. Surgical tracheostomy is performed under general anesthesia. Incision may be horizontal or vertical. After recognition of thyroid gland and exposure of trachea, the 2nd-3rd tracheal ring is cut, a tracheostomy tube is inserted and airway is ensured. Percutaneous tracheostomy is performed in intensive care units, on the patient's bed, using a leading wire and dilators. It is not indicated for all patients, because there is danger for serious haemorrhage. Postoperative care for the first few days includes aspiration of secretions, humidity, physiotherapy, changing the tracheostomy tube and equipment that is kept by the bedside of the patient.Results: So what oncological patients are concerned, in ENT region, tracheostomy is used mostly in cases of laryngeal cancer when laryngectomy or radiotherapy is going to follow. Immunosuppression and complications are more frequent than in non-oncological patients. Conclusions: Management of oncological patients with tracheostomy has special demands. Because of cancer, the patient's general condition is affected. Many problems may be caused if management of the tracheostomy is not proper. Anesthetic management or sedation techniques used were recorded.

Approximately 25-48% of these tumors occur in the head and neck region, with only 1% occurring in the mouth. Case report: A 10-year-old girl presented with a slow-growing, painless swelling on the left side of the tongue for 6 months duration. It was associated with disturbance to mastication and phonation. Result: Examination revealed a 5 cm 9 4 cm, globular left tongue mass which is mobile with smooth surface. There was no neurological deficit and no neck nodes palpable. She underwent excision of the mass under general anaesthesia. Complete enucleation with primary closure was carried out. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery and histological evaluation was consistent with schwannoma. There was no recurrence noted following tumour extirpation. Conclusion: The diagnosis of schwannoma is usually made postoperatively by histological identification although modern imaging techniques can provide useful indications.

Choriocarcinomas disseminate rapidly through the hematogenous route whereby the lungs are most frequently affected. Although rare, metastases to the brain and skin have been reported but to date very few papers have reported metastasis to the gingiva. Case report: A 22-year-old female was referred to our department for persistent bleeding from the upper left gum for a few days. She is a known case of uterine choriocarcinoma treated with chemotherapy in 2008. She came to the Emergency Department in June 2009 with complaint of vomiting, headaches and abdominal pain. Further investigations revealed metastasis to the lungs, brain, liver and kidney. On intraoral examination, oral hygiene was poor with multiple decayed teeth. Area of complaint was left maxillary quadrant whereby a 1 cm 9 0.5 cm hyperplastic swelling which resembles pyogenic granuloma or peripheral giant cell lesions or fibrous epulis was noted around the buccal and palatal aspect of teeth 23, 24, 25 and 26 with moderate oozing. Blood investigations showed raised INR and APTT with low haemoglobin and platelet levels. Following transfusion, incisional biopsy with Biolase Waterlase dental laser was performed and HPE result came back as metastasic choriocarcinoma to the gingiva. Dental laser was used to minimize and arrest bleeding as adrenaline packing and tranexamic mouthwash failed to do so. Conclusion: This emphasizes the fact that suspicious gingival lesion should be investigated thoroughly for the presence of an underlying malignancy.Laboratory of Parasitology and Parasitic Diseases, Veterinary Faculty, Aristotle University, Thessaloniki, Greece, ENT Oncologic Department, ''Theageneio'' Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece, Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, ''Theageneio'' Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF23": {"text": "Reconstruction after surgical treatment of head and neck cancer Pavlos Maragoudakis, Panagiotis Gerbesiotis, Nikos Papadimitriou, Dimitrios Iosif, Thomais Mandrali, Thomas Nikolopoulos 2nd University Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Attikon Hospital, Athens, Greece", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF24": {"text": "PP077Ameloblastoma: report on a case and mandibular reconstruction using stereolithographic modelingF.

Although head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) may respond to radio and chemotherapy, the accuracy of the response remains uncontrolled. This is why it is of great importance that new molecular markers are identified in HNSCC in order to use them as possible targets in the treatment of cancer. Objectives: Study Wnt genes and Fz receptors as potential tumoral markers in HNSCC by gene expression in samples of pair-matched benign and cancer tissue obtained from the same HNSCC patient. Assess possible correlation between the levels of expression and the clinicopathologic outcome. Materials and methods: A total of 50 freezed samples obtained from 50 patients treated surgically for HNSCC were analyzed. This study examined the mRNA expression of five members of the Wnt family and two members of the Fz family in samples of HNSCC. Real time qPCR experiments were performed on a LightCycler 480. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 16.0 for Windows. Results: mRNA levels of expression of the different Wnt and Fz genes were compared with clinicopathological variables (TNM, tumor localization, grade of differentiation, sex, age) by non-parametric tests. Discussion: qPCR experiments confirmed that genes of the Wnt and Frizzled families are frequently expressed in HNSCC. Some of these genes could represent attractive targets for the treatment of these tumors.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "annex"}, {"text": "WNT/BETA catenin signalling pathway following rat tongue carcinogenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide Introduction: The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway plays important role in development, tissue homeostasis, and regeneration. Inappropriate activation of the Wnt pathway is linked to a wide range of human cancers. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to characterize the Wnt/betacatenin signaling pathway as depicted by the expression of Wnt1, Frizzled-1, Wnt5a, Frizzled-5 and b-catenin during 4NQO-induced rat tongue carcinogenesis by immunohistochemistry. Materials and methods: Male Wistar rats were distributed into three groups of 10 animals each and treated with 4NQO solution at 50 ppm through their drinking water for 4, 12, and 20 weeks. Ten animals were used as control group. Results: No histopathological abnormalities were induced in the epithelium after 4 weeks of carcinogen exposure; however, an over expression of Wnt5a was noticed when compared to control group (p \\ 0.05). Wnt1 also showed positive expression, without significant differences (p [ 0.05) in this period. The Wnt1 pointed out significant differences (p \\ 0.05) in pre-neoplastic lesions at 12 weeks following carcinogen exposure. In well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma induced after 20 weeks of treatment with 4NQO, Wnt1 was expressed in the majority of the dysplastic cells and tumor cells being statistically significant (p \\ 0.05). No significant differences (p [ 0.05) were found in expression of Frizzled-1, Frizzled-5 or \u00df-catenin following oral carcinogenesis. Conclusion: Taken together, our results support the belief that expression of Wnt1 and Wnt5a is related to malignant transformation and conversion of the oral mucosa.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PP252"}, {"text": "Expression profiling of cell cycle regulatory proteins in oropharyngeal carcinomas using tissue microarrays Introduction: While incidence of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, in general, has decreased progressively during the last two decades, an increased incidence of oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma has been reported worldwide.

Materials and methods: Paraffin blocks from 21 primary tumors were obtained from archives Department of Pathology, Paulista Medical School, Federal University of Sao Paulo, UNIFESP/EPM. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of p53, p16, p21, and Rb by means of tissue microarrays. Results: Expression of p53, p21, p16 and Rb was not correlated with the stage of disease, histopathological grading or recurrence in squamous cell carcinomas of the oropharynx.

The aim of this study was to determine the expression of E-cadherin in various grades of OSCC and to correlate changes in the expression between these various grades and metastatic lymph nodes. Methods: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect E-cadherin expression in normal oral mucosa, primary OSCC (n = 37) and metastatic lymph nodes (n = 10). E-cadherin immunoreactivity was correlated with grades of differentiation and with clinicopathological features.Results: E-cadherin immunoreactivity was found to inversely correlate with the loss of cell differentiation. The expression of E-cadherin decreased significantly in advanced cases of OSCC. However, increase in E-cadherin immunoreactivity was seen in early lesions, i.e., in well differentiated (n = 9) and moderately differentiated OSCC (n = 13). Furthermore, E-cadherin was negative in majority of metastatic lymph nodes (7/10). Conclusions: Loss of the cell adhesion and E-cadherin plays an important role in progression of OSCC, i.e., down regulation of its expression is associated with de-differentiation and metastasis. Introduction: Tissue biopsy and histopathologic examination remain a prerequisite for diagnosis of oral lesions. While RNA expression analysis of epithelium can be used to detect various diseases, such as oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), it also requires biopsy. Brush cytology currently allows for noninvasive acquisition of oral epithelial cells that can be used, to identify OSCC and other pathologic entities. Purpose: Our goal is to demonstrate that oral epithelial cells obtained noninvasively with brush cytology can be used to isolate RNA that is suitable for accurate gene expression analysis. In addition, analysis of brush cytology obtained RNA can be used to differentiate oral diseases with similar presentation. Materials and methods: Brush cytology samples collected in a standardized fashion from patients with biopsy proven OSCC, premalignant lesions and controls were used to isolate RNA. The cytology RNA was used to perform global gene expression analysis and determine gene expression patterns among the groups. Results: Consistent differential expression of 3 out of 4 housekeeping genes in brush cytology samples was found among the OSCC, premalignant lesions and controls. We have previously validated the reproducibility of this technique of using cytology RNA for identification of differential gene expression in our ''hamster OSCC model''.Conclusions: Consistent quality of cytology samples obtained and isolation of high quality RNA can be achieved. Analysis of high quality brush cytology RNA can be used to differentiate oral diseases such as OSCC and pre-malignant lesions that may have similar presentation while allows for gene expression profiling of these conditions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PP256"}, {"text": "Heterogeneity of p53 staining in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck Sankalap Tandon 1,2 , Nazia Munir 1,2 , Jeffery Lancaster 1 , Nicholas Roland 1 , Shaun Jackson 1 , Tim Helliwell 3 , Mark Boyd 2 , Terence Jones 1,2 1 Department of Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery, Aintree University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, UK, 2 Division of Surgery and Oncology, School of Cancer Studies, The University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK, 3 Department of Pathology, The University of Liverpool, The Duncan Building, Liverpool, UK Introduction: Mutation of the p53 tumour suppressor gene is important in the development of cancer. The p53 status of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) has been investigated extensively. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of cores of tumour samples, arranged in tissue microarrays (TMAs) is a commonly used technique. A common criticism of this approach is that the selected tissue cores may not be representative of the tumour as a whole. Purpose: To investigate the degree of heterogeneity of p53 staining across whole slides of SCCHN. Materials: Whole tissue sections from 48 resection specimens of primary SCCHN arising in the larynx, oropharynx, oral cavity and hypopharynx were studied after ethical approval was obtained. Methods: IHC staining was performed using a monoclonal antibody to p53 (DO-7) and the avidin-biotin-peroxidase detection system. Slides were analysed, by two independent observers, for overall p53 expression and the degree of heterogeneity of expression across the whole sample. A cut-off of 10% expression was used to differentiate p53 positive samples from negative samples. Results: 19 (40%) cases were p53 negative. 29 (60%) tumour samples were p53 positive of which 25 (86%) showed no heterogeneity. Conclusions: Overall, 92% of samples analysed in our series showed no heterogeneity in p53 expression across the whole tumour specimen. These results indicate that TMAs can be considered to provide a reliable representative sample of tumour for IHC analysis of p53 status. Introduction: Genetic studies have implicated p53 mutation as a significant risk factor for therapeutic failure in SCCHN. However, in a recent meta-analysis of p53 in SCCHNs from the major anatomical sub-sites we have demonstrated that associations between patient survival and p53 status in the literature are ambiguous. Mutant p53 status can potentially be inferred with a higher degree of specificity by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for p53 in combination with MDM2 (a transcriptional target of p53) rather than p53 status in isolation. This was investigated in our study. Purpose: To identify simple combinations of biomarkers as predictors of patient outcome and prognosis. Materials: Tissue microarray (TMA) of 198 SCCHN samples from patients collected by the Liverpool Tissue Bank. Methods: The TMA samples were analysed by immunohistochemistry for p53 and MDM2. Results: Whilst, neither p53 nor MDM2 are informative alone, the inferred mutant p53 phenotype (p53 +ve, MDM2-low) is significantly associated with reduced overall survival (P = 0.035). Conclusions: Loss of p53 function is a critical event in carcinogenesis. Nevertheless, despite many studies of p53 expression it remains unclear whether loss of p53 function in SCCHN is associated with adverse outcome. By combining IHC for p53 with a second p53 target gene (MDM2) as an indicator of wild-type p53 function, we find that patients with a ''mutant'' p53 phenotype display significantly reduced survival. Combining markers offers a simple approach to increase the specificity of IHC analysis of critical pathways in cancer samples.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PP262"}]}
