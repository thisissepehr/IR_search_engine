The rate of infection in patients treated for rejection was 48.8% as compared to 26.2% in patients without rejection (P< 0.01). Antirejection therapy was associated with culture-positive cases in 33 out of 43 patients as compared to 9 out of 16 patients who had CMV antibody titer elevations. Patients were treated with gancyclovir if they had simultaneous positive cultures from multiple sites and were seriously ill. Eighteen of the 19 patients thus treated had side effects, one of which was serious (bone marrow hypoplasia). Cultures became negative in 15 out of 17 (88%) of the surviving patients. Patient survival was similar to our overall survival rate of 87%.",

However, it did not prevent the formation of virus-induced intranuclear tubular structures [4] . Gancyclovir was also found to be effective in reducing CMV shedding in solid organ transplant recipients and was well tolerated. Relapses were infrequent in these patients in contrast to patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) [3, 7] .",

The age of the patients ranged from 4 to 65 years with a mean of 41.9 years. There were 68 males and 83 females. Donors were selected on the basis of body size and AB0 compatibility. Only three AB0-mismatched, compatible transplants were performed. Immunosuppression was based on cydosporin (CyA) and prednisolone (P). Patients with good preoperative renal function [glomerular filtration rate (GFR) greater than 40 ml/min] received 10 mg/kg CyA orally or 2 mg/kg IV along with 50 mg P orally or IV preoperatively. During surgery a single dose of 1000 mg hydrocortisone was given. If the patient was diuresing, CyA was given at a dose of 1-2 mg/kg IV every 12 h. Prior to November 1986, attempts were made to maintain CyA levels at 800-1200 ng/ml (whole blood RIA); administration was oral or IV, depending on how it was best tolerated. Since November 1986, CyA levels of 600-800 ng/ml have been the goal. In patients with poor renal function preoperatively (hepatorenal syndrome or GFR less than 40 ml/min), no CyA is given preoperatively; instead, patients re-ceive 3 mg/kg azathioprine (AZA) IV. CyA is withheld or used at greatly decreased levels and AZA is continued until renal function recovers.",

Weekly liver graft biopsies were obtained for pathological examination, and viral culture and liver biopsies were also obtained for suspected rejection. Biopsies and cultures from other sites, such as the gastrointestinal tract and lung, were done if necessary, according to the clinical presentation of the patients. The viral cultures were performed using standard cell culture tube methodology with rhesus monkey kidney A-549 and MRC-5 cell lines. In addition, since late 1985, early detection has been achieved using MRC-5 shell viral centrifugation enhancement with CMV early nuclear monoclonal antibody labelling for detection within 36-72 h [5, 6, 15, 19, 20] . Buffy coat cultures were done using the above-mentioned techniques after recovering WBCs from a heparinized blood specimen using mono-poly resolving medium.

For example, unexplained lower abdominal pain in two of our female liver transplant patients necessitated screening for CMV infection, and CMV endometritis was documented in these patients.

Forty-two of the 86 patients (48.8%) who experienced rejection during the study developed CMV infection. We noted that antecedent rejection was also more common in culture-proven cases than in patients having titer elevations only. Furthermore, 56.3% (9/16) of the patients with isolated titer elevations had antecedent rejection as compared to 76.7% (33/43) with positive cultures. A good number of patients with positive cultures had two rejection episodes, something which is expected with increased immunosuppression. A large number of patients (54.8%) who developed both rejection and infection received OKT3, but OKT3 per se did not seem to contribute significantly to development of the infection.",

The fact that other medications and antibiotics were administered concurrently with gancyclovir could partly explain the occurrence of these side effects in all but two patients who had seizure and rash while on gancyclovir alone. In comparison, a study of 17 transplant patients (5 kidney and 12 liver transplants) reported side effects to be mainly hematological abnormalities occurring in 4 out of 17 patients. These abnormalities ranged from thrombocytopenia to leukopenia to neutropenia. All reversed after discontinuation of treatment [8] . In spite of the side effects that our patients developed, gancyclovir demonstrated clinical, virological, and serological efficacy in the treated group. An excellent survival rate of 89.5%, with a follow-up of up to 1.5 years, was achieved in the treated group. The survival rate in the untreated group was also high (82.5%). The fact that the treated group had a more severe disease, as evidenced by clinical symptoms, positive CMV cultures from multiple sites simultaneously, multiple concomitant infections, and concurrent rise in CMV antibody titers demonstrates the efficacy of gancyclovir. The successful treatment of these severe symptomatic infections could be attributed to the combination of gancyclovir with other treatment modalities, in particular the administration of gamma globulin, which was administered to 14 out of 19 patients together with gancyclovir therapy. This combination therapy has been demonstrated to be highly efficacious in other settings as well [2, 17, 18 ]. Yet, the two patients who died in the treated group were patients who received combination therapy (see Table 1 ).",

The excellent results obtained in these patients can be attributed to a number of factors. First, more sensitive techniques allow early and rapid detection of CMV infection. Second, our protocol calls for lower doses of immunosuppression than those previously used. Third, a judicious decrease in immunosuppression leads to survival in most patients. Finally, the use of gancyclovir in the most severely infected patients with disseminated CMV disease, most of whom have concomitant bacterial infections, improves chances for survival, despite the fact that these immunosuppressed transplant recipients, in our series as well as in other series, have the least chance of survival.",
