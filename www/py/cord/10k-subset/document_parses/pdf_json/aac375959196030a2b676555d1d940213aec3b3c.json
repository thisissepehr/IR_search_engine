Within the immune system, T lymphocytes are crucial for adaptive immune responses, and are activated upon recognition of peptides displayed by human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) or class-II (HLA-II) molecules at the surfaces of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). T lymphocytes express the T cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes specifi c peptides, which have been processed and presented in combination with an HLA molecule. There are two major subtypes of T lymphocytes: CD8 + cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) and CD4 + helper T cells. CTLs recognize peptides in the context of HLA-I molecules, while CD4 + helper T cells recognize peptides associated with HLA-II molecules. The functional activity of these two subsets of T cells is said to be restricted by HLA-I and -II molecules, respectively.",

HLA-I antigens consist of three non-covalently associated components: a 45 kDa glycosylated amino acid (AA) heavy chain (HC), a 12 kDa light chain (beta 2 microglobulin, \u03b22m), and a short 8-10 AA self-peptide. The heavy chain of HLA-I consists of about 340 AA residues, including a cytoplasmic region (about 30 AA residues), a transmembrane region (about 40 AA residues), and an extracellular region composed of three immunoglobulin-like domains (\u03b11, \u03b12, and \u03b13), each consisting of approximately 90 AA. The \u03b11 and \u03b12 domains form a peptide-binding groove and contain the positions contributing to the binding pockets for the peptide and T cell receptors. The binding groove is divided into six distinct pockets (A-F) based on chemical and physical characteristics; the most important pockets for peptide binding are the B and the F pockets. The membrane-proximal \u03b13 domain of the HC contains a binding site for the co-stimulatory molecule CD8 [ 13 ] expressed by CTLs, which play an important enhancing role in killing virus-infected cells and cancer cells. The \u03b11 and \u03b12 domains consist of two segmented alpha helices forming the walls and eight antiparallel \u03b2 strands forming the fl oor-together forming a unique peptide-binding groove, which is the site where the self (or foreign antigen-derived) peptide (8-10 AA) binds to the polymorphic parts of the HC and is presented to peptide-specifi c CTL for scrutiny. \u03b22m is non-covalently associated with the extracellular region of the HLA-I heavy chain by non-covalent interactions with \u03b12 and \u03b13 domains [ 14 ] . \u03b22m is essential for the correct conformation of the peptide-binding groove of the heavy chain and stabilizes the HLA-I antigen peptide complex on the cell surface. Thus, \u03b22m indirectly participates in the antigen presentation to specifi c T-cell receptors of CTL [ 15 -17 ] .",

Initially, the HLA-I HC associates with the chaperone calnexin (CNX) initiating an early folding and a disulfi de bond formation within the HC. The newly synthesized HLA-I HC then associates with \u03b22m to form heterodimer. This heterodimer is rapidly recruited into the peptide-loading complex (PLC) consisting of a transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), and the chaperones tapasin, calreticulin (CRT), and ERp57. The HLA-I HC/\u03b22m heterodimer is now ready for peptide loading. Peptides, both self-and pathogen-derived, are predominantly generated in the cytosol by the proteasome to degrade cytosolic proteins into short peptides, although a proteasomeindependent peptide produced directly by insulin-degrading enzyme has been recently documented [ 18 ] . Thereafter, the peptides are transported into the ER by the TAP1 and TAP2. These peptides are further trimmed by aminopeptidase ERAAP1 and ERAAP2 to 8-10 AA, a length appropriate for HLA-I binding.",

Classical HLA-II molecules include HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP and are expressed mostly in the membrane of the professional antigen-presenting cells, where they present processed extracellular antigenic peptides to CD4 + T cells. In contrast to the antigen-binding groove of HLA-I molecule, which is closed at each end, the antigen-binding groove of HLA-II molecules is open at both ends and allows longer peptides (13-25 AA) to be loaded [ 21 , 22 ] . During synthesis of HLA-II molecules in the ER, the \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains are produced and associate with an invariant chain, which stabilizes the HLA-II molecule and prevents it from binding of intracellular peptides or peptides from the endogenous pathway. The invariant chain directs transportation of HLA-II from the ER to the Golgi complex, followed by fusion with late endosomes which contain peptides derived from endocytosed, degraded proteins (self or foreign). The invariant chain is then cleaved by cathepsins to form a small fragment known as CLIP, which occupies the peptide-binding groove of the HLA-II molecules. HLA-DM facilitates CLIP removal and makes the peptide-binding groove of HLA-II ready for peptide loading before the HLA-II-peptide complex migrates to the cell surfaces to be scrutinized by CD4 + T cells [ 23 ] .",

            "text": "The concept of supertypes was fi rstly introduced by Alessandro Sette's group in 1995 [ 24 , 25 ] . The defi nition of an HLA supertype is that HLA molecules with similar peptide binding features are grouped into one supertype; this means that if a peptide is able to bind to one allele within a supertype, it can also bind to all other alleles in this supertype. In practice, actually only a few peptides that are able to bind to one allele in a supertype can bind to all the other alleles within the supertype. To date, many methods have been used to defi ne HLA-I supertypes, including structural similarities, shared peptide-binding motifs, and identifi cation of crossreacting peptides [ 26 -29 ] . Based on motifs derived from binding data or sequencing of endogenously bound peptides, along with simple structural analyses, Sette and Sidney [ 30 ] defi ned nine supertypes (HLA-A1, -A2, -A3, -A24, -B7, -B27, -B44, -B58, -B62), which were reported to cover most of the HLA-A and -B polymorphisms. Subsequently, Ole Lund's group [ 26 ] constructed hidden Markov models (HMMs) [ 31 ] for HLA-I molecules using a Gibbs sampling procedure [ 32 ] and defi ned a similarity measure between these sequence motifs. By using this similarity to cluster alleles into supertypes, Ole Lund's group [ 26 ] further defi ned three new HLA-I supertypes (HLA-A26, -B8, and -B39), in addition to the nine supertypes described previously by Alessandro Sette's group [ 30 ] , which was based on about 100 HLA-I peptide interactions. In the past few years, a lot of binding data have been generated; MHC-binding motif information is readily accessible",

They provided updated supertype assignments, with new assignments for about 1,000 different HLA-I alleles, which is about a tenfold increase in the number of alleles compared to their original classifi cation done in 1999 [ 30 ] . In the updated HLA-I classifi cation, Alessandro Sette's group found that about 80 % of the 945 alleles examined were classifi ed into one of the nine supertypes identifi ed previously [ 30 ], and they did not suggest the existence of any other novel supertypes. However, they found that some alleles have specifi cities spanning two different supertypes, nine alleles share features of both the A01 and A03 supertypes, and another ten alleles have a specifi city overlapping the A01 and A24 supertypes [ 29 ] .

Seven different supertypes (main DR, DR4, DRB3, main DQ, DQ7, main DP, and DP2) were defi ned. Subsequently, according to motif-based supertype classifi cation [ 27 ] , seven different supertypes were defi ned after the analysis of 27 HLA II proteins described in a previous report [ 41 ] . All the molecules belonging to the DP genetic locus (DPB1*0101, DPB1*0201, DPB1*0401, DPB1*0402, DPB1*0501, and DPB1*1401) were grouped into a single supertype; DQ proteins were grouped into two different supertypes, each containing three HLAs: (DQB1*0301, DQB1*0302, DQB1*0401) and (DQB1*0201, DQB1*0501, DQB1*0602). The motif-based classifi cation of the DR proteins is less defi ned compared with the other loci. The HLA-DR can be grouped into four supertypes: (DRB1*0401, DRB1*0405, DRB1*0802, DRB1*1101), (DRB3*0101, DRB3*0202), (DRB1*0301, DRB1*1302), and the fourth containing the remaining DR proteins.

To increase population coverage, one might include defi ned epitopes for each HLA-I allele; however, this would lead to a vaccine comprising hundreds of peptides. As mentioned above, one way to reduce this complexity is to group HLA molecules into HLA supertypes; a classifi cation that as mentioned above refers to a group of HLA alleles with largely overlapping peptide binding specifi cities [ 24 , 25 , 30 ] . Ideally this means that a peptide, which binds to one allele within a supertype, has a high probability of binding to other allelic members of the same supertype. The concept of HLA supertypes has been successfully applied to characterize and identify T cell epitopes from a variety of different pathogens, including measles-mumps-rubella, SARS, EBV, HIV, HCV, HBV, HPV, infl uenza, LCMV, Lassa virus, F. tularensis , vaccinia, and cancer antigens as well [ 29 ] .",

The technology behind \"reverse immunology\" is developing rapidly in order to identify T cell epitopes from tumor antigens and infectious microorganisms [ 44 -51 ] . During the SARS epidemic back in 2003, the SARS genome was identifi ed in a matter of weeks, and a complete CTL epitope scanning-just barely possible at that time-was completed a few months later [ 43 ] . Therefore, \"reverse immunology\" as a powerful tool to identify T cell epitopes has now reached the stage where genome-, pathogen-, and HLA-wide scanning for HLA-binding antigenic epitopes become feasible at a scale and speed that makes it possible to exploit the genome information as fast as it can be generated. Importantly, a large-scale dataset of measured HLA-II-binding affi nities covering 26 allelic variants, including a total of 44541 affi nity measurements for HLA-DR alleles as well as 11 HLA-DP and DQ molecules [ 52 ] , are available to be used as training data for generating prediction tools utilizing several machine learning algorithms. To date, the computer-based algorithms for predicting peptides binding to HLA-I molecules are being developed for HLA-II-restricted peptide epitopes, a development, which is of pivotal importance for understanding the immune response and its effect on host-pathogen interactions [ 32 , 52 -55 ] . Those tools will defi nitely lead to fast identifi cation of novel peptides restricted by HLA-I and HLA-II supertypes for use in vaccines against infectious agents as well as tumors. In this respect, individual peptides harboring both HLA-I and HLA-II binding potentials [ 46 -48 , 56 ] might be of particular importance.",
