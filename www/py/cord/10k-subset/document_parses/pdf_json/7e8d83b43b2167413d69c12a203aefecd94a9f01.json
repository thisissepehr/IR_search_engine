Here, we utilized probes comprising headless, HA stabilized stem (SS) to determine the prevalence, binding and neutralization breadth of antibodies directed to HA stem-epitope in a crosssectional analysis of the general population. Five group-1 HA SS probes, representing five subtypes, were chosen for this analyses. Eighty-four percent of samples analyzed had specific reactivity to at least one probe, with approximately 60% of the samples reactive to H1 probes, and up to 45% reactive to each of the non-circulating subtypes. Thirty percent of analyzed sera had cross-reactivity to at least four of five probes and this reactivity could be blocked by competing with F10 bNAb. Binding cross-reactivity in sera samples significantly correlated with frequency of H1 + H5 + cross-reactive B cells. Interestingly, only 33% of the cross-reactive sera neutralized both H1N1 and H5N1 pseudoviruses. Cross-reactive and neutralizing antibodies were more prevalent in individuals >50 years of age. Our data demonstrate the need to use multiple HA-stem probes to assess for broadly reactive antibodies. Further, a universal vaccine could be designed to boost pre-existing B-cells expressing stem-directed bNAbs.

            "text": "The ability to elicit broadly cross-reactive antibodies against the conserved stem of HA could be the basis for an influenza vaccine capable of providing protection against various antigenically distinct or drifted influenza strains 2 . In principle, an HA stem-targeting, broad specificity influenza vaccine would not require annual updates, and would induce near universal immunity against diverse influenza viruses. For example, it has been shown that vaccination with H1-based HA-stabilized stem (SS) nanoparticles, that have the variable HA head region removed, elicit broadly cross-reactive antibodies and provides protection in mice and ferrets against lethal heterosubtypic H5N1 influenza virus challenge despite the absence of detectable H5N1 neutralizing activity in vitro. Further, passive transfer of immunoglobulin from H1 HA SS nanoparticles-immunized mice to naive mice resulted in full protection from lethal H5N1 challenge, indicating that HA stem-specific antibodies protect against diverse group 1 influenza subtypes in animal models 12 . Similar vaccination strategies have been reported against group 2 influenza A subtypes as well 13 . Accordingly, reliable methods to detect and assay for broadly reactive stem-specific antibodies will be needed to determine their prevalence in the human population, and also to assess the efficacy of next-generation influenza vaccines. Although previous studies have interrogated the prevalence of broadly-reactive stem-directed antibodies in humans using various methods including competition assays, chimeric HA, or phage display methods [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , none of these studies used structurally-defined stem-only probes to measure binding and stem-specific neutralizing activity in human sera. Here, we present a new set of structurally-defined 12 stabilized-stem probes (seasonal and pandemic H1, H2, H5, and H9) to determine the prevalence, frequency, breadth and specificity of broadly reactive antibodies in human sera. Analysis of 202 human sera samples revealed a wide prevalence of broadly-reactive antibodies to multiple group-1 HA subtypes.",

            "text": "Characterization of HA stabilized stem. FPLC purified HA SS proteins (Supplementary Fig. 1 ) were characterized by ELISA using human monoclonal Antibodies CR6261, CR8020 and FI6v3 6, 12, 24 . H1 HA NC99 and HIV gp120 proteins served as positive and negative controls, respectively. Ab binding was detected by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Rockland Immunochemicals Inc., PA, USA). Dose-response curve was plotted using absorbance reading at Y-axis and antibody dilutions on X-axis. Endpoint dilutions were determined from non-linear fit dose-response curves using a detection limit of four-fold (4 X) above background absorbance (washing buffer alone) 12 . The HA NC 99 SS was further characterized by ELISA and pseudotype neutralization competition assays. Presence or absence of the stem epitope bound by CR6261 on each of the various engineered proteins was measured by the ability of a given protein to compete the antibody CR6261 away from either substrate protein, in an ELISA, or pseudotyped virus, in a neutralization assay. Briefly, ELISA binding competition was performed by incubating CR6261 with the competitor protein (H1 NC 99, H1 NC 99 \u0394stem, H1 NC 99 SS, H1 NC 99 SS \u0394stem or gp120) at a concentration of 10 \u03bcg/ml prior to addition to plates pre-coated with H1 NC 99 (200 ng/well) and blocked with 5% skim milk 21, 22 . Neutralization competition was performed as previously described 21, 25 in which serially diluted CR6261 (starting from 10 \u00b5g/mL) was incubated in the presence of a constant amount of H1 NC 99, H1 NC 99 SS, their respective \u0394stem Ile45Arg/Thr49Arg probes, or gp120 control (10 \u00b5g/mL) for 1 hr at RT before addition to pseudotyped recombinant HA/NA lentiviruses. The virus/antibody/ competitor mixture was then applied to 293 A cells, which where incubated overnight; media was changed after 12-14 hours; and luciferase activity was measured 48 hours later as described 21,25 . Human Sera Collection. In this study, we used archived serum samples that were collected from healthy adult donors (United States residents) between 2004 and 2010 in six Phase I vaccine clinical trials evaluating influenza, Ebola or SARS DNA vaccines. The samples were collected after approval from relevant institutional research ethics committees and using informed consent signed by the enrolled patients. The studies were conducted at the NIH Clinical Center by the NIAID Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD) (Clinicaltrials.gov identifiers: NCT00973895, NCT00489931, NCT00776711, NCT00099463, NCT01086657, NCT00072605). Sera samples assessed in this study were collected at baseline, prior to administration of any vaccine. All protocols were approved by the NIAID Intramural Institutional Review Board and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services human experimental guidelines for conducting clinical research were followed. Samples with binding end-point titers to WT SS, six-fold or higher than that to \u0394stem probe were considered positive for the presence of antibodies targeting broadly neutralizing epitopes. Samples reactive to four out of five (4/5) probes were considered cross-reactive and were analyzed further by competition assay against F10-ScFv bNAb. Briefly, sera were diluted in blocking buffer (5% skim milk) containing constant amount (20 \u03bcg/ml) of competitor single-chain Fv (scFv) F10 or control anti-HIV scFv CH31 26 . Mixtures were then added to ELISA plates coated with H1 NC 99 SS (200 ng/well), incubated for 1 hr at RT, washed, and detected with anti-human Fc-specific secondary conjugated with HRP. Samples were considered positive for stem-epitope antibodies if they were competed by F10 but not by CH31 scFv with statistical significance at 95% confidence interval using a two-tailed t-test. Cross-reactive B cells flow cytometry analysis. In order to assess HA-directed B cell binding and cross-reactivity, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC's) from samples with different stem binding based on ELISA assay (n = 18) were further analyzed by flow cytometry. Three groups were selected for the analysis: negative for stem antibodies (n = 5), reactive to one stem only (n = 4), and samples with cross-reactive stem binding (n = 9). Cryopreserved PBMC's were thawed in R-10 media containing 50 U/mL of Universal Nuclease (ThermoFisher). Cells were washed and resuspended in PBS for staining with UV-Blue viability dye (ThermoFisher) for 20 minutes at room temperature. After washing, surface staining was performed using antibodies against IgM (G20-127, BD Biosciences), IgG (G18-145, BD Biosciences), CD8 (RPA-T8, BioLegend), CD3 (OKT3, BioLegend), CD56 (HCD56, BioLegend), CD14 (M5E2, BioLegend), CD19 (J3-119, Beckman Coulter), CD27 (O323, BioLegend), CD38 (HIT2, BioLegend), and HA probes [27] [28] [29] . H1 NC 99 and H5 INDO 05 HAs were expressed and biotinylated followed by fluorochrome labeling as previously described 29 . Stained cells were run on a BD LSRFortessa X-50 and data analysis was performed using FlowJo (TreeStar). The gating strategy is demonstrated in supplemental Fig. 2 . Statistical significance at 95% confidence interval was done using two-tailed t-test.",

The mean frequency of cross-reactive H1 + H5 + memory B cells was statistically higher in subjects whose sera reacted to at least four different HA SS probes in ELISA (average of 0.24%) than in subjects whose sera minimally reacted with only one (average of 0.084%) or zero (average of 0.083%) probes (p = 0.003, p = 0.001, respectively) (Fig. 3A) . Furthermore, the frequency of H1 + H5 + cross-reactive B cells was observed to correlate strongly with the relative magnitude of serum HA stem antibody binding (defined as the fold difference reactivity between WT and \u0394stem HA SS probes) (Fig. 3B) . Stem-Specific Neutralization of H1N1 and H5N1 Viruses. Next, we evaluated the neutralization breadth of the 60 broadly cross-reactive sera samples by measuring sera neutralization of H1N1 NC 99 and H5N1 IND 05 pseudoviruses. The pseudotyped-lentivirus system was chosen due to its sensitivity, enabling the detection of neutralizing antibodies even at low titers. Samples were considered positive for stem dependent neutralization if the difference in neutralization competition between HA and HA \u0394stem was \u226520%. (Supplementary  Fig. 3 ). With these criteria, 47 out of 60 samples (78%) were positive for stem-epitope dependent neutralization of H1N1 pseudovirus (Fig. 4A) . Thirty-three percent of cross-reactive samples had neutralizing activity to both subtypes, and only 5% were strictly H5N1 neutralizing (Fig. 4A) . In total, one third of the samples designated as cross-reactive by ELISA had significant neutralization breadth against both H1N1 and H5N1 pseudoviruses that was dependent on HA stem epitope-reactive antibodies (Fig. 4A) . H1N1 neutralization was independent of stem-directed antibody titers in the sera, as we saw no significant difference in ELISA endpoint titers between neutralizing and non-neutralizing samples (Fig. 4B) . However, H5N1 neutralization correlated to antibody ELISA endpoint titer against the H5 INDO 05 HA SS probe (Fig. 4B) . Determinants of Cross-Reactive Antibodies. Analysis of subjects' traits and the presence of cross-reactive stem antibodies revealed no association with gender or race. Remarkably, sera collected either prior to the 2009 pandemic or afterwards (after January 1, 2010 [30] [31] [32] showed no differences in cross-reactivity or the ability to neutralize either H1N1 or H5N1 pseudovirus (Table 1) . We also observed no difference in the profiles of cross-reactive sera from vaccinated and non-vaccinated samples collected after the H1N1 pandemic emergence (Table 1) . However, there was a statistically significant boost in specific stem antibody titers to H1 CA 09 HA SS probe in subjects that received pandemic H1N1 influenza vaccine compared to those that did not receive the vaccine within the same time period (Fig. 5) . We also noted a higher rate of cross-reactive antibodies in the older population, especially those born within or before the period of H2N2 pandemic 33 (Table 1) . While approximately 23% of the subjects less than 30 years of age were positive for cross-reactive antibodies, the percentage increased by 1.75-and 2.40-fold in subjects between the ages 40-49 and those over 50 years of age, respectively ( Table 1 ). The higher rate of cross-reactive antibodies in the older population was consistent with the higher neutralizing activity against of both H1N1 and H5N1 pseudoviruses. A 3-5-fold increase in H5N1 neutralization was noted in subjects between the ages 40-49 and those over 50, respectively, compared to those under the age of 30.",

Here we provide a new serological approach for assessing the frequency, magnitude, breadth and specificity of antibodies in human sera directed to broadly neutralizing HA stem-epitope. Our analyses improve upon other published papers 8,14-20 in that we analyzed higher number of samples, we used structurally defined stem-only HA SS probes to detect stem-directed antibodies paired with \u0394stem probes to confirm the epitope targeted, and we assayed antibody binding and neutralizing breadth on individual serum samples, rather than pooled sera. The HA SS probes allow definitive measurement of stem antibodies without the potential interference of anti-HA head antibodies, while \u0394stem probes measure and allow us to account for antibodies targeting the specific epitope encompassing the supersite for bNAbs. Furthermore, by utilizing HA SS probes for several HA subtypes (seasonal and pandemic H1, H2, H5, and H9) we were able to directly assess the breadth of sera reactivity to all four group 1 HA subtypes known to have infected humans. In addition, we demonstrated a correlation between HA stem-specific antibody binding and neutralization with the presence of cross-reactive HA-specific B cells that have been shown in other studies to express immunoglobulins that target the HA stem 27, 34 .",

As expected, reactivity to the H1 HA subtypes, both seasonal and pandemic, was commonly observed (~60%). However, 42%-45% of samples also reacted to the stem-epitope of the non-circulating subtypes (H2, H5, and H9). Furthermore, 30% (n = 60) of the samples harbored reactivity to at least 4 out of 5 probes. Our findings suggest a much higher prevalence of group 1 HA stem epitope directed antibodies in the general population (84%) than previously reported values of up to 30% in unvaccinated subjects 14 . BNAbs recognizing group 1 HA stem have been shown to arise predominantly (>60 %) from the IGHV1-69 v-gene 28, 29 . Moreover, antibodies containing the VH1-69 v-gene have been observed to be expressed at high levels of up to 11% 35 . Finally, germline-reverted, VH1-69-containing, HA stem-reactive bNAbs have been shown to recognize group 1 HA stem antigens and require minimal levels of somatic hypermutation for maturation 11 . Therefore, the human immune system has evolved the capacity to generate stem-directed influenza antibodies in the large majority of individuals. The difference in the reported seroprevalence rate of stem-directed antibodies in this study compared to others could be referred to the difference in the used methodology and type of analysis. Firstly, we used multiple subtypes to screen for stem antibodies, which enables better detection coverage, and secondly, we specifically screened for epitope-specific response by utilizing WT and \u0394stem probes, while defining a cutoff value of end-point-binding-titer fold difference between the two probes.",

We found that the incidence of cross-reactive antibodies, as well as their neutralizing activity of H1N1 and H5N1 pseudoviruses, was age dependent. This could be due to a more extensive exposure to diverse influenza strains via infection or vaccination. This includes the exposure to H2N2 subtype that circulated between 1957 and 1968 33 , as well as the swine H1N1 strain that emerged in the late 1970s 36 . Moreover, childhood imprinting by the first influenza strains encountered by a subject has been suggested to play a role in adult immune response to influenza 37 . The breadth of antibody binding in sera correlated with the frequency of cross-reactive memory B cells isolated from PBMCs.

Furthermore, although significant number of sera samples were broadly reactive in terms of stem binding as measured with ELISA, only a subset of these (30%) were able to neutralize a divergent non-circulating group 1 virus (H5N1). These observations suggest that subtle variations in the specificity of stem-directed antibodies or structures of HA stem surfaces between subtypes may result in varying degrees of breadth. Our resluts also indicate that these antibodies could be cross-reactive but not necessarily cross-neutralizing, partially depending on their titers in the sera. Whether such cross-reactivity translates into other effector mechanisms such as ADCC and CDC requires further investigations.

Interestingly, a meta-analysis of studies that evaluated the serological evidence of H5N1 infections in humans indicated a seropositivity up to 2% in high risk groups and concluded that H5N1 viruses can cause mild or subclinical infections in humans 41 . Our findings in animal models indicate that stem antibodies can protect against lethal H5N1 infection although they lack measurable neutralizing activity against the virus in vitro, which suggest the involvement of other mechanisms such as ADCC and CDC. This suggest that stem antibodies might provide better protection from LRTI rather than URTI.

Therefore, it may be feasible to design candidate vaccines that can effectively boost pre-existing responses with cross-protective capacity.
