Neverthless, it may result in severe complications, especially in particular age groups and clinical conditions. Down Syndrome represents a risk factor for developing complications, because of the frequent comorbidities and their immunodeficiency. Case presentation: A 2-year-old white Caucasian female affected by Down Syndrome was referred to our hospital for cardiac arrest in course of varicella disease. After cardiopulmonary resuscitation and stabilization, her clinical conditions didn't improve and she developed a massive pulmonary hemorrage, which led her to exitus. Conclusions: Mortality due to varicella infection is rare, but it is more common in subjects with immune deficit or chronic pathologies, and in particular age-groups. The importance of the vaccine for preventable infectious diseases is stressed in this paper, in which we present a case of death in an unvaccinated cardiopathic child with Down Syndrome affected by varicella.",

She had never been vaccinated up to the moment, that's why she contracted the disease from her sister. The night before her admission to the hospital, she began to manifest episodes of hypotonia associated to periods of crying. At 4 o'clock she began to show signs of a generalized hypotonia and she was taken to our hospital by her parents, where she arrived in cardiac arrest. After Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR-PALS) her spontaneous breathing was restored. The clinical course was characterized by complete areflexia, with bilateral mydriasis. Breathing pattern was characterized by ARDS that required high frequency mechanical ventilation and Nitric Oxide with transient improvement.",

As the burden of preventable infections in children diagnosed with chronic diseases is high in terms Fig. 2 Histological image that showed interstitial pneumonitis and diffuse necrosis and hemorrhage in the pulmonary parenchyma of incidence and severity, it is essential to protect these children with timely administration of vaccinations according to the current recommendations. Even among populations at risk, varicella vaccine is the less used. Although Italian Down children have the best vaccination coverage among all patients with chronic disease [21] , it is clear that it is desirable to improve vaccination coverage among risk groups and also among the healthy population.",
