Each year, influenza has spread around the world causing about 250,000-500,000 deaths and more than 5 million cases of severe illness. The objective is as follows: evaluating the outcomes of patients with influenza A (H1N1) virus in relation to certain TNF-308, IL6, and IL8 polymorphisms and identifying the associated factors with the severe outcome. Subject and methods: This is a case-control study. The cases were patients confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to be influenza A (H1N1) virus infected. The controls were healthy individuals. Medical history and outcome of the disease was registered. In all study participants, polymorphisms of TNF rs1800629, IL6 rs18138879, and IL8 rs4073; odds ratio (OR); and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated. Results: Infection with influenza A (H1N1) virus was associated more with the following genotypes: TNF-308 AA (OR = 4.041; 95% CI = 1.215-13.4) and IL8 AA (OR = 3.273; 95% CI = 1.372-7.805). According to our study results, HCV (OR = 3.2, 95% CI 1.2-8.5), renal disease (OR = 3.4, 95% CI 0.9-13.6), cancer (OR = 3.1, 95% CI 0.3-31.1), TB (OR = 8.4, 95% CI 1.8-39.7), ICU (OR = 2.9, 95%1.2-7.1), and mortality (OR = 7.9, 95% CI 0.9-67.4) are considered as risk factors for influenza A (H1N1)-infected patients.
