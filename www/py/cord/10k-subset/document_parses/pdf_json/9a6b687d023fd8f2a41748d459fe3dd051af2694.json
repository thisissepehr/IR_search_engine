The disorder is most frequently associated with adenocarcinomas of the ovaries, uterus, or adnexa, adenocarcinomas of the breast, and small cell carcinoma of the lung (SCLC) [1, 4, 5] (Table 1) . A smaller number of cases has been reported in association with Hodgkin's disease, and rare cases have been reported with other malignancies [1, 6] . Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration may have its onset up to 5 years prior to cancer detection. Disease progression typically leads to complete incapacitation, the patient often being unable to sit without assistance, speak clearly, or assist in any aspects of his or her care. In most instances, recovery of neurological function is limited.",

Published reports consist largely of retrospective individual cases, with only a few case series. In the majority of reported patients, immunomodulatory and/or immunosuppressive treatment is often combined with therapy directed at the underlying tumor, making it difficult to ascertain the role of either intervention. Most patients have been treated with corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin G, and/or cyclophosphamide, singly, or in combination. Although clinical improvement has been reported following treatment in individual patients, most patients fail to improve [23, 25, 26] . Stark et al reported limited clinical improvement in 2 women with anti-Yo antibody response treated with cyclophosphamide [27] . Uchuya et al treated 22 patients with paraneoplastic syndromes, 4 of whom had paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration associated with anti-Yo antibodies with between 1 and 11 courses of intravenous immunoglobulin G. [28] . Treatment was initiated 2-8 months following onset of symptoms. Functional status of these patients at initiation of treatment was not described. Improvement was not observed in any of the 4 patients [28] . Keime-Guibert et al treated 8 (7 with anti-Yo antibodies and 1 with anti-Hu) with 1-7 courses of combined intravenous immunoglobulin G (0.5 g/kg/day for 5 days) plus methylprednisolone (1 gram daily for 3 days) plus cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2 given on day 4 of IV IgG), with additional treatments administered according to patient status [19] . Interval between onset of symptoms and treatment ranged between 2 weeks and 3 months in patients with anti-Yo antibody and was 10 months in the patient with anti-Hu antibody. Clinical stabilization was observed in 3 patients; 5 patients continued to progress [19] . Prognosis may be better in patients with anti-Ri antibody response and ataxia, where improvement has been reported in individual patients in response to treatment with corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin G, or cyclophosphamide, along with treatment of the underlying tumor [29] [30] [31] [32] . An important question is whether initiation of therapy early in the clinical course might improve prognosis. One of the patients treated with cyclophosphamide by Stark et al gained almost complete functional recovery following initiation of treatment 24 days after onset of symptoms [27] . Moll et al reported a patient with atypical antineuronal antibody response in whom intravenous immunoglobulin G initiated 26 days after symptoms onset resulted in clinical improvement; in this patient plasma exchange initiated at day 10 had been unsuccessful [33] . Widdess-Walsh et al noted a good response to intravenous immunoglobulin G and prednisone in 3/4 patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration and anti-Yo antibodies syndromes in whom treatment was begun within 1 month of disease onset [29] . Vernino et al investigated 20 patients with central paraneoplastic syndromes associated with anti-Yo, anti-Hu, and anti-CV2 antibodies. Patients were excluded if bedridden or with symptoms of over 1 year in duration, weighting the study towards individuals earlier in the course of illness [22] . Eleven patients had paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, all associated with anti-Yo antibodies. Improvement by at least 1 point on the Rankin Score was seen in 2 of the 4 patients receiving plasma exchange plus cyclophosphamide and in 2/11 patients receiving plasma exchange plus antineoplastic chemotherapy; this degree of improvement was often of functional significance. However, only 1 patient demonstrated marked improvement. This patient, treated with plasma exchange and cyclophosphamide, began treatment 12 days after symptom onset [22] . Recently, partial clinical remission of paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration has been reported following treatment with tacrolimus plus prednisone [34\u2022\u2022] . In this uncontrolled trial minor improvement in neurological status was noted in 13 of 19 patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration and anti-Yo antibody following treatment with tacrolimus and prednisone [34\u2022\u2022] . However, none of the patients regained functional neurological independence. Partial remission of symptoms has also been described in 3 patients following treatment with rituximab [35, 36, 37\u2022] . Two of these patients were women positive for anti-Yo antibodies [35, 36] ; the third patient was a child with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration occurring in the setting of Hodgkin's disease and anti-Tr antibodies [37\u2022] . Clinical improvement has also been reported in one case of cerebellar degeneration associated with anti-mGluR1 antibodies following treatment with IVIgG plus ongoing mycophenolate mofetil [16] .",

In general, however, infusion should begin at a rate of 0.01-0.02 ml/kg body weight per minute for 30 minutes. If this is well-tolerated, then the rate may be gradually increased to a maximum of 0.08 ml/kg body weight per minute. If the patient reacts adversely to the infusion, then the rate should be reduced, or the infusion halted, until symptoms subside [18] . In patients with limited or compromised acid-base compensatory mechanisms and in patients in whom there is already an expanded fluid volume (eg, during pregnancy), consideration should be given to the effect of additional fluid or protein load.

These may be characterized by symptoms of flushing, anxiety, abdominal cramps, myalgias, arthralgias, dizziness, fever, chills, headache, nausea, chest tightness, and fluctuations in blood pressure, or heart rate. Some patients experience chronic malaise. Hypertension has been described during infusion. Intravenous immunoglobulin G has produced aseptic meningitis, with fever, headache, photophobia, nuchal rigidity [18] . Onset is usually within several hours to 2 days. CSF in these cases usually has a predominantly neutrophilic CSF pleocytosis with elevated protein and usually normal glucose. Recovery without sequelae usually occurs within several days after the infusions have been discontinued [40] . A study by Sekul et al suggests that patients with migraine may be at greater risk for this complication of the drug [40] . Work by Jayabose et al in children with immune thrombocytopenia suggests that pretreatment with corticosteroids may reduce the risk of meningitis [41] . Occasional patients may develop reversible renal insufficiency. Intravenous IgG increases blood viscosity, and thromboembolic events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and intracranial venous sinus thrombosis, have been reported in up to 3 % of patients [42] [43] [44] .",

CD20 is important in B-cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation [48] . Rituximab is currently approved for treatment of B cell (non-Hodgkin's) lymphoma and rheumatoid arthritis and has been found to be of value in treatment of multiple sclerosis [49] . The agent has reduced B cells in both blood and CSF, with B cell numbers remaining depressed for between 3 and 12 months [50, 51] . In studies of children with opsoclonus-myoclonus treated with rituximab, Prazatelli et al found that CSF B cell populations (including CD27+ memory, CD38+ activated, and CD5+ subsets) remained significantly depressed in CSF for 12-18 months despite repopulation of these cells in blood [52] . Although CD20 is not expressed on plasma cells, Petereit et al have reported depletion of plasma as well as B cells from both serum and cerebrospinal fluid of a patient treated with rituximab [51] . However, despite its effect on B lymphocytes, rituximab may fail to reduce titers of specific antibody in serum or CSF [36, 51] .

Infusion reactions may require Benadryl, intravenous fluids, glucocorticoids, epinephrine, bronchodilators, or oxygen. Infusion reaction can usually be managed by slowing the rate by at least 50 %.

MPA targets inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, a rate-limiting enzyme in de novo synthesis of guanosine nucleotides essential for DNA synthesis [45, 61] . The enzyme plays a particularly important role in T-and B-lymphocytes and is 5-fold more potent in inhibiting the isoform of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase found in activated lymphocytes compared with the isoform found in most other cells [61] . The agent induces apoptosis of activated lymphocytes and may also reduce lymphocyte recruitment by suppressing expression of adhesion molecules and suppressing production of inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS). MPA also suppresses primary (but not secondary) antibody responses [61] . Mycophenolate mofetil has received extensive use in myasthenia gravis [62, 63] and has been used, often in combination with prednisone, in treatment of limbic encephalitis associated with antibodies to neuronal surface antigens [64] [65] [66] [67] . Its use has not been reported in proven paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, but it has been used to induce disease stabilization in 1 patient with mGluR1associated cerebellitis in whom no tumor was found [16] .",

Candler et al in a study in which patients with paraneoplastic neurological syndromes were followed over time, found that treatment of the underlying tumor, with or without immunosuppressive therapy, was the only measure which was associated with stable or improved neurological condition [21] . Likelihood of improvement or stabilization of paraneoplastic neurological syndromes may depend the duration of paraneoplastic symptoms prior to tumor remission and on the specific autoantibody involved. Clinical outcome appears to be poorest in patients with anti-Yo, anti-Hu, anti-Tr, and anti-mGluR1antibodies but significantly better in patients with anti-Ri antibody [23] . Partial remission in cerebellar symptoms was reported in 3/3 patients undergoing successful treatment of Hodgkin's disease [84] .",
