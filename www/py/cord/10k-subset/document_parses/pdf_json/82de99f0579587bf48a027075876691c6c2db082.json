In recombinant models, LTD 4 potently activates calcium mobilisation while LTE 4 induces very weak responses. In contrast, in a human mast cell line, LAD2, LTE 4 induced calcium with similar potency as LTD 4 , with EC 50 9.3 nM and 4.9 nM for LTE 4 and LTD 4 , respectively. Our aim was to analyse responsiveness of human mast cells to cysLTs. Method and results: LTE 4 was the most potent activator of gene expression in LAD2 cells when measured using Affymetrix microarrays, regulating the expression of more than 70 genes, including immediate early genes, transcription factors, cytokines and membrane receptors. This has been confirmed for a selection of genes at the mRNA and protein level. Although the pattern of responses to cysLTs did not resemble classical CysLT 1 or CysLT 2 activity, both intracellular calcium signalling and gene expression were significantly inhibited by CysLT 1 inhibitor montelukast and not affected by CysLT 2 inhibitor HAMI3379. Conclusion: Our data suggest that leukotriene E4 is a potent activator of human mast cells acting potentially through CysLT 1 or an unidentified receptor. 1369 Immunodeficiency, hypopituitarism and mastocytosis: a puzzling association Background: Authors emphasize the role of hormones for T and B cell to generate humoral or cell mediated immune responses. Compelling evidence confirm that B lineage deficiency, in the absence of thyroid hormone, is due to the decreased survival or lower rate of proliferation of committed B cell precursors. Method: A 39-year-old white man presented to our Department for not pruritic, Darier's sign positive, red-brown macules gradually appeared and distributed over trunk, upper arms and neck. Medical history included a GH-deficiency treated with replacement therapy from 12 to 16 year old. No history of recurrent infections, familiar immunodeficiency or thyroid disease. Physical examination revealed a height of 168 cm and weight of 83 kg. The skin was dry, hair and eyebrows were thinning. Examination of other districts was normal. Results: Hormones dosage showed hypothyroidism (FT4 0.83 lg/dl, TSH 6.660 lU/ml) while antithyroperoxidase and antithyreoglobulin antibodies were negative. Data confirmed low levels of GH (IGF-1 <25 ng/ml; GH <0.05 ng/ml) showing also testosterone deficiency. Antipituitary antibodies were negative. Moreover we revealed humoral immunodeficiency (IgA 0.441 g/l, IgM 0.317 g/l, IgG 8.940 g/ l) with normal values of T and B cell subpopulations. Brain MRI evidenced Chiari type I malformation and reduced volume of the anterior pituitary gland. Posterior pituitary gland and hypothalamus were normal. Bone density scan (DEXA) evidenced a severe osteoporosis (T-score \u00c03.1; Z-score \u00c03.0). No evidence of focal lesions by X-ray of major bones. Echocardiogram exhibited normal volume of heart cavities. Histology of skin biopsy confirmed mast cell accumulation in a perivascular distribution within derma. Conclusion: We first describe the association of hypopituitarism, immunodeficiency and mastocytosis, a rare disorder characterised by mast cell proliferation and accumulation within various organs, most commonly the skin. This association supports in vivo the functional link between the endocrine and immune systems as shown in many reports where the development and function of the immune system are strightly related to hormonal levels. In this patient hormonal deficiency may have been the cause of immunodeficiency. We stress the importance of immunological screening in patients with hormonal deficiency, even if asymptomatic, since, in some cases, replacement hormonal therapy can correct immunodeficiency. Introduction: Systemic mastocytosis is a rather uncommon disease characterised by mast-cell proliferation and massive release of vasoactive mediators such as histamine. Its clinical features generally include erythema, urticaria, hypotension and epatosplenomegaly. Less common clinical manifestation are possible. We report two cases in which a cardiac arrest was the first appearance of the disease. Case 1: A 72-year-old male previously in good health, suddenly complained of epigastric pain after dinner, rapidly followed by nausea, vomiting and loss of consciousness. When emergency medical team reached, he appeared unconscious, with respiratory activity but pulseless. EKG showed no electrical activity. A laryngeal tube was positioned and epinephrine 2 mg was administered, obtaining a reprise of cardiac activity. The EKG showed a mild ST elevation in inferior leads and signs of anterior subendocardic ischemia, recovered in the following EKGs. Echocardiography, coronary angiography and serum troponins were normal. A laboratory test for tryptase was then performed and showed markedly elevated values (75 lg/ml). Bone-marrow biopsy and fine-needle aspiration showed a pattern of severe mast-cell hyperplasia, with atypical inter-and paratrabecular mast-cell aggregates CD117 and CD25 positive and CD2 and CD34 negative. PCR-RFLP highlighted D816V mutation of the c-kit gene. We therefore made the diagnosis of severe systemic mastocytosis. Case 2: A 57-year-old male, with no previous history of allergic or cardiac diseases, developed general malaise, flushing and loss of consciousness while was at work. He was given cardiopulmonary resuscita-tion by colleagues and came to the hospital in coma. EKG showed diffuse ST depression, echocardiography was normal. Tryptase values were significantly higher (200 lg/ml) and kept elevated after 10 days (18.6 lg/ml). Fine needle aspiration and bone marrow biopsy showed mast-cell hyperplasia with mast-cell paratrabecular aggregates CD117 and CD68 positive and rare CD2 positive cells. PCR-RFLP did not show D816V mutation of the c-kit gene.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 526, "end": 527, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1439, "end": 1443, "text": "1369", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Conclusions: A relatively uncommon clinical feature like a cardiac arrest may underline a rare disease like systemic mastocytosis, so that diagnosis should be considered in every case of cardiac arrest not otherwise explainable.

A new method for KIT D816V mutation detection allows determination of the level of mutation positive cells. Objective: To investigate whether the severity of clinical manifestations in adult patients with ISM correlates to the level of KIT D816V positive cells in peripheral blood (PB) or bone marrow (BM) aspirate. Methods: We included 48 adult ISMpatients (28 female/20 male) from our centre in whom the KIT D816V mutation level in both BM aspirate and PB was available. For each patient the severity of mediator related symptoms (skin, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal and neuropsychiatric) was graded and episodes of anaphylaxis were evaluated by interview and medical record files. Bone mineral density (BMD) was determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Results: Median fraction (range) of KIT D816V positive cells was 0.6 (0.01-90)% in BM and 0.3 (0.003-49)% in PB. Skin symptoms was present in 41 (85.4%), gastrointestinal in 33 (68.8%), musculoskeletal in 17 (35.4%) and neuropsychiatric in 15 (31.2%) patients. Seventeen (35.4%) had experienced at least one anaphylactic episode. Fourteen (29.2%) had osteoporosis and additional 18 (37.5%) had osteopenia. No significant differences in KIT D816V mutation level were detected when comparing patients with none/mild symptoms and patients with moderate/severe symptoms, patients with and without anaphylaxis or patients with osteoporosis/osteopenia and normal BMD. Even though some of the included patients exhibited high mutation levels, none had progression into aggressive forms of SM in the observation period. Conclusion: Fraction of KIT D816V mutation positive cells is a new parameter generally applicable in SM. In the present study we did not detect any significant correlation between the severity of clinical manifestations and the level of KIT D816V mutated cells. Whether this reflects the KIT D816V mutation being carried by cells of non-MC lineage or by non-mature MC-progenitors is presently not clear.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Background: Idiopathic anaphylaxis (IA) is a diagnosis of exclusion and remains to be a challenge for allergists. Multiple theories on the pathogenesis of IA have been proposed, although none of them can explain the underlying mechanisms. Clonal mast cell disorders (CMD) and its substantial overlap in the clinical manifestations of idiopathic anaphylaxis have led to the search for an association between these rare disorders. Currently, two forms of CMD have been characterised: systemic mastocytosis (SM) and monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome (MMAS) . In this study, we sought to determine the prevalence of CMD among IA patients, and to explore if pathogenesis of IA could be explained by unrecognised CMD. Method: We identified patients (\u226518 year) who were referred to the Allergy clinic between January 2006 and Dec 2012 due to recurrent or unexplained anaphylaxis. All patients initially underwent a complete allergy work-up; thereby the diagnosis of IA was confirmed after exclusion of possible elicitors. Baseline tryptase (sBT) levels were measured. Twenty-seven patients, 14 males and 13 females, who either had minimum of three anaphylactic reactions or elevated sBT levels (>11.4 ng/ml) regardless of the number of anaphylactic episodes were recruited and enrolled in this prospective study. None of the patients had signs of urticaria pigmentosa. All 27 patients further underwent a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate to investigate clonal markers of CMD and underlying mast cell hyperreactivity using current WHO-criteria. We evaluated characteristics of the bone marrow mast cells by pathology, flow cytometry and detection of KIT D816V mutation. Results: Thirteen (48%) out of 27 investigated patients (10 males and 3 females) were diagnosed with CMD; 8 with indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) and 5 with MMAS. All ISM patients had a sBT levels >11.4 ng/ml (in six patients >20 ng/ml), whereas sBT was elevated only in two MMAS patients (15 and 23 ng/ml). Four of the eight patients with ISM had bone marrow mast cell aggregates. Among 14 non-clonal IA patients, only one had elevated (17 ng/ml) level of sBT. There was a clear male predominance in patients with CMD (77%). Conclusion: In this study, mechanism of IA could be explained by a hyper-reactive mast cell phenotype in 48% of the IA patients. Thus, our study suggests that clonal mast cell disorders are a substantial differential diagnosis of IA, particularly in male patients with elevated sBT. 1374 The clinical features and long-term prognosis of Churg-Strauss syndrome Background: Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS) is a rare disease characterised by asthma, eosinophilia, and systemic vasculitis. Method: We retrospectively analyzed clinical manifestations and long-term outcomes of 53 patients who diagnosed as CSS at Samsung Medical Center from 1995 to 2011. Subjects included 27 men and 26 women with a mean age of 43 (18-80) years. The mean follow-up period was 48 months. Results: Most commonly involved organs were peripheral nervous system (70%), lung (51%), skin (42%), and heart (21%). ANCA was detected in only 5 of 36 (14%) patients. Thirty six patients were treated with corticosteroid plus cyclophosphamide pulses, and 17 patients were treated with corticosteroid alone. Ten patients were lost to follow-up and three patients expired. One patient died of heart failure due to uncontrolled vasculitis, and two died of pancreatic cancer and unknown etiology. Twenty four patients showed sustained remission, of which seven patients could discontinue the medication, and 17 patients were well controlled with low-dose (<5 mg/ day) prednisolone.

Aim of the study: To establish 2D and 3D cultures of human primary nasal epithelial cells and to evaluate the antiinflammatory effect of butterbur extract (Tesalin \u00e2 ), of which mechanisms of action are currently unknown. Method: Biopsies were obtained from patients undergoing turbinoplastic surgery. Scratch biopsies were obtained from the inferior turbinates of healthy, non-atopic volunteers. Scratch biopsies and Trypsindigested turbinates were cultured in 24-well plates until 80% confluent and then stimulated with the viral stimulus Poly IC alone or in combination with Tesalin \u00e2 . Readouts were production of IL-8 and neutrophil chemotaxis. For the 3D model, a collagen/ fibroblast layer was created. On day 7, primary human nasal epithelial cells were seeded on top. The model was cultured in fibroblast media and moved to the airliquid-interface at day 13.

They were fluctuating, hyperemic, painful and at a diameter of 10 9 10 cm in size. Laboratory tests: WBC: 16.200/mm3, erythrocyte sedimentation rate: 92 mm/h. Fluid collections consistent with abscesses were shown at right shoulder and the left axillary region by both ultrasonography and computed tomography. The abscesses were drained and antibiotic therapy was started. S. Aureus was isolated at aspirate cultures. Right shoulder magnetic resonance imaging was consistent with septic arthritis. Immunological analysis of patient revealed low phagocytosis function (73.4% in granulocytes and 61.4% in monocytes), decreased CD4 + T-cell ratio (27.6%), low CD4 + T/ CD8 + T ratio (0.68), increased serum IgG (28.6 g/l) and increased total IgE (929.53 IU/ml). This case had 24 points according to Grimbacher et al's hyper IgE syndrome scoring system. Conclusion: Although, hyper IgE syndrome is one of the PID syndromes which is frequently diagnosed in childhood, it must be considered especially in cases with extensive staphylococcal abscesses in adulthood. 1385 New aspects of the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases in frequently ill children Maleyka, K Azerbaijan Medical University, 2nd Children Diseases, Baku, Azerbaijan Background: Bronchopulmonary pathology remains one of the most urgent problems of pediatrics. Despite multiple research papers on this problem, diseases of the respiratory system, continue to worsen, recur and swich to a chronic form. Method: The aim of our study was to identify the pathogenic mechanisms respiratory diseases in frequently ill children (FIC) . To this end, were examined 340 FIC with respiratory diseases at the age of 6 months to 6 years. In 55 FIC acute viral infections without complications, in 74 FIC was observed acute bronchitis, in 175 FIC-recurrent bronchitis and in 36 FIC was acute pneumonia. In patients were examined in the acute period of the disease and in the period clinical remission of number of CD3-cells, CD4-cells, CD8-cells, CD19-cells, the content of serum immunoglobulins A, M, G,E, the content of cytokines IL-1betta, TNF-alfa, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-gamma, the level of substance P, state of hemostasis, microbiocenosis upper respiratory tract and intestinal.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1723, "end": 1727, "text": "1385", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2247, "end": 2252, "text": "(FIC)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Results: Our results show that in the acute period of the respiratory disease, reduced the level of cellular immunity (mainly, CD3cells, CD4-cells and the index immunoregulator cells), marked imbalance of humoral immunity reduction of IgA and IgG, increase of IgM and IgE.

In acute period of the disease is marked as raising the neuropeptide -substance P and blood clotting. The high correlation between the immune system including cytokine status, substance P and hemostatic system. We found that the clinical remission of respiratory diseases in FIC is not accompanied by a normalisation parameters of the immune system, cytokine status, substance P and hemostatic system. High level of proinflammatory cytokines in the period of clinical remission, reflect ongoing inflammation, which is associated with persistence of the infection agent. Of these infectious in our patients revealed chlamydia, mycoplasma, cytomeqalovirus, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans. Our FIC in 67. 6% of cases observed dysbiosis, the severity of which correlated decrease the immune system. Conclusion: Given all this, it is necessary to carry out adequate therapy of respiratory diseases in FIC. Case presentation: We present the case of a 7-year-old girl who was evaluated for suspected Brown syndrome. Her blood tests showed a lack of antibody response to tetanus, pertussis, poliovirus, and measles vaccines, and a borderline response to the diphtheria vaccine. These findings were confirmed after a second course of vaccination. She had no history of recurrent or severe infections. A complete immunological work-up showed non-protective antibody levels for tetanus and rubella, borderline antibody levels for measles and diphtheria, and protective antibody levels for parotitis; on the other hand, she showed IgG antibodies for EBV, CMV, VZV and HSV-1. She also presented low levels of IgM and IgG3, absent T cell proliferation to tetanus toxoid (with normal proliferation to Candida and mitogens), normal distribution of T cell subsets, borderline values of B cells able to switch and switched B cells, and normal in vitro Ig production. Interestingly, the mother of the patient, aged 40, presented with similar immunological findings and no history of recurrent or severe infections. We administered a new course of vaccination (tetanus, pertussis, diphtheria and poliovirus) to the girl and then monthly we evaluated both antibody titres and T cell proliferation. One month after vaccination, the patient showed normal antibody responses, and normal T cell proliferation responses; however, these responses gradually decreased and eventually disappeared at 5 months. In conclusion, the child and mother present a low antibody response to protein vaccines, in particular to tetanus toxoid. After an adequate initial antibody and T cell response, no immunological memory was mounted. The mechanisms of such an abnormal immunological response have not been completely clarified yet. Similar conditions have not been reported in humans, while, in murine models, they seem related to deficits in signaling lymphocyte activation molecule-associated proteins. It is interesting that the patient presented with VCA-IgG and EBNA-IgG antibodies, indicative of a previous infection, which actually occurred without any complication. Given the presence of similar findings in the mother, suggestive of a mendelian inheritance, exome sequencing is currently in progress.

Method: Ninety eight patients with AR diagnosed according to modified allergic rhinitis criteria in the 'Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma' (m-ARIA) document were enrolled in the study and 140 healthy volunteers with no history of AR and with the same ethnicity of the patient were recruited as the control group. Genotyping was done for two TNF-a promoter variants, one variant in promoter region of IL1a, two SNPs in IL1b gene, one in IL1 receptor and IL1RA, and two promoter variants of IL-6 gene, using PCR sequencespecific-primers method. Results: Patients homozygous for the T allele of rs16944 in IL1b had an 8.1-fold risk of having AR than those with the C allele. In TNF-a, there were also significant relationships between two SNPs of rs1800629 and rs361525 and having AR. Patients homozygous for the G allele of rs1800795 in IL-6 had a 3.35 fold risk of having AR than those with the C allele.

Background: Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is a rare X-linked recessive immunodeficiency disorder characterised by thrombocytopenia and small platelets, eczema, recurrent infections, and an increased risk of autoimmunity and malignancy. Clinical features of the disease are highly varied; therefore, the diagnosis is sometimes difficult. The WASP gene encodes a multidomain protein (WASP) that is expressed predominantly in hematopoietic lineages. The main function of WASP is to couple signals generated at the cell membrane level with the reorganization of the cellular cytoskeleton, ultimately resulting in cell activation and the promotion of cell motility. Approximately 400 unique mutations have been reported in the WASP gene. In this study, we report a boy with classical, and identified a novel WASP gene mutation: a splicing mutation IVS3-2A>G.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Poster Session 59"}, {"text": "Case: A 4-mount-old boy was admitted because of recurrent infection, bloody diarrhea, and thrombocytopenia.

They include skin barrier dysfunction, reduced skin lipid content, and abnormalities of the innate immune response. Some of the innate immune defects observed in atopic dermatitis are primary defects, such as epithelial barrier defects and defects in signaling or expression of innate receptors. Here we report seven cases of Hyper IgE syndrome mainly presenting with atopic eczema. Case report: Seven patients, five born to consanguineous parents, were evaluated and mean age at diagnosis was 5 years. Eczematous dermatitis, mainly on face, scalp and repeated bacterial skin and lung infections were present in all patients. Cutaneous viral infections and chronic candidiasis of the nails were seen in two patients. Facial paralysis was observed in one of the patients. All but one had high serum IgE levels. Hypereosinophilia, and CD4 lymphopenia were observed in all patients. DOCK8 mutations were identified in four patients and under evaluation in three patients. Therapeutic measures included antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis, immunoglobulin replacement therapy in all patients with interferon alpha therapy in one case who presented with widespread papillomas. All patients were evaluated for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Conclusion: The hyper-IgE syndrome is a rare primary immunodeficiency disorder characterised by high serum levels of IgE, recurrent skin and lung infections and atopic eczema.

Currently, the etiology of bronchiectasis remains unknown in a high percentage of patients (26-53%).

Lung function tests revealed a mixed obstructive and restrictive pattern. Arterial blood gases showed respiratory alkalosis. Immunoglobulins dosage and sweat chloride were normal. Negative sputum culture and PPD skin test. Abdominal fat biopsy for amyloid deposits was negative. In vitro production of IFN-c was reduced. Conclusion: Bronchiectasis may be the result of several processes. Two types of bronchiectasis are known: cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF associated. COPD, postinfectious, congenital defects (primary ciliary dyskinesia, Kartagener syndrome), amyloidosis and immunodeficiency may be the cause of non-CF bronchiectasis. In our case, aberrant IFN-c secretion can be con-sidered the trigger of bronchiectasis. IFN-c has a critical role in innate and adaptive immunity against viral and intracellular bacterial infections through containment and eradication of intracellular organisms, via macrophage activation. The case we describe provides additional evidence that a diagnosis of IFN-c deficiency should be taken into account in all patients with idiopathic bronchiectasis.

Case report: A 10-year-old girl admitted to outpatient department of our unit after suffering throughout her childhood from recurrent infections. She was frequently diagnosed with otitis, sinusitis, and tonsillitis and was hospitalised several times for pneumonia. Long duration of antibiotic therapy was frequent and she was usually requiring intravenous antibiotics. Although she had been immunised with Varicella vaccine, she had a severe Varicella infection when she was 8 years old. Along with the frequent infections, she had a history of afebrile convulsions. She was still on levetiracetam and risperidon treatment with diagnosis of epilepsy and mentalmotor retardation. Frequent infections have been attributed to her mental-motor retardation and have not been previously investigated in terms of immune deficiency. On presentation, she had mild respiratory symptoms. The physical examination revealed crepitant rales on right hemithorax. The chest radiographs showed an illdefined opacity in the right middle and lower lobes suggesting pneumonia.

In initial investigation we found lymphopenia, hypereosinophilia, low immunoglobulin levels, T + B-NK+ phenotype. His clinical and immunological findings were compatible with Omenn syndrome. Case five and six, 3 months old boy and 3 months old girl admitted to our hospital with pulmonary infection. They had lymphopenia and low immunoglobulin levels. Flow cytometry indicated T-B-NK + phenotype severe combined immunodeficiency.

However, whether the alteration of innate immune response was similarly existed in CRSwNP patients with different inflammatory profiles is unknown. This study is to evaluate the expression of the short palate, lung, and nasal epithelium clone 1 (SPL-UNC1), an innate immune protein, in the eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic polyp tissues, and to investigate the possible modulation of SPLUNC1 in vitro. Method: Nasal tissue samples were collected from 35 CRSwNP patients and 24 control subjects. CRSwNP patients were divided into eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic subtypes based on immunohistochimical staining of major basic protein (MBP). The number and morphology of glands in nasal tissues was determined by AB/PAS staining. The SPLUNC1 was examined using real-time PCR, immunoblot and immunohistochemical staining. The mRNA levels of IL-1a, IL-4, IL-13, IL-17A, and IFN-c in polyp tissues were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. Moreover, the expression of SPLUNC1 in polyp epithelial cells (PECs) after inflammatory cytokines stimulation was measured using real-time RT-PCR and ELISA assays. Results: We found the expression of SPL-UNC1 was significantly reduced in CRSwNP patients compared to the control subjects (P < 0.05). When polyp tissues were divided into two subtypes, we found the number of submucosal glands and expression of SPLUNC1 were significantly reduced in the eosinophilic polyp tissues compared to that in the non-eosinophilic polyp tissues (P < 0.05). Accordingly, the mRNA levels of IL-4 and IL-13, but not IL-1a, IFN-c and IL-17A, were significantly increased in the eosinophilic polyp tissues compared to that in the non-eosinophilic polyp tissues (P < 0.05). Moreover, after stimulated by recombinant IL-4 and IL-13, SPLUNC1 expression in the dispersed NP cells was significantly inhibited (P < 0.05). In contrast, SPLUNC1 expression in PECs was significantly unregulated after stimulated with TLR-2, 3, 4, 5 and 9 ligands (P < 0.05).

Nasal mucosal immunereactivity may occur in varying degrees in polyps with allergic and non-allergic rhinitis. RANTES is locally produced within the nasal microenvironment of polyps and may be responsible for the eosinophil recruitment. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha with TH2 cytokines as interleukin-5 may enhance Nasal polyp fibroblast to produce inflammatory mediators. We evaluated the differences of nasal polyps from adolescents with allergic and non-allergic rhinitis for evaluation of RANTES, TNFa, and IL-5 contents. Method: We recruited 29 adolescents with allergic (n = 15, mean age: 17.4 years old) and non-allergic rhinitis (n = 14, mean age: 15.6 years old) undergoing polypectomy. Immunoassays were performed using polyp tissue homogenates to quantify the levels of RANTES, TNF-a, and IL-5 and sera to assess total IgE, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) from them. Results: TNF-a, IL-5, and RANTES levels in atopic polyp was higher detected compared with non-atopic polyp tissue homogenates (IL-5: atopics 181.5 AE 143.6 vs non-atopics 82.7 AE 88.3 ng/100 mg, RAN-TES: atopics 174.5 AE 63.5 vs non-atopics 60.3 AE 38.5 ng/100 mg, TNF-a: atopics 180.8 AE 121. 9 vs non-atopics 64.1 AE 64.5 ng/100 mg), but INF-c levels in polyp with non-allergic rhinitis was observed to be not significantly higher than in polyps allergic rhinitis(INF-c: atopics 14.78 AE 8.5 vs non-atopics 9.02 AE 6.5 ng/ 100 mg). Conclusion: TNF-a, IL-5, and RANTES play important role in inflammatory recruitment leading to cell activation and directional migration of Th2 specific leukocyte subsets and contribute to endothelial migration for allergic reaction. Therefore they are involved in the pathogenesis of all of rhinitis and polyps with non-allergic rhinitis may undergo polypous degeneration into non-specific inflammation. 1413 The relationship between basophil and eosinophil in eosinophilic chronic sinusitis patients Suzuki, Y; Tokano, H; Inaba, Y; Iwasaki, A; Kitamura, K Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan Background: The eosinophilic chronic sinusitis (ECS) has been a challenging disorder and it very often relapses after surgical treatment. ECS patients usually have other allergic diseases, such as bronchial asthma, atopic dermatitis and eosinophilic otitis media. According to the recent literature, the number of both basophils and eosinophils is closely related in ECS patients. This time, we investigated whether the number of basophils simultaneously change with that of eosinophils in ECS patients. Method: The subjects were 18 ECS patients who performed surgery at our department in 2012. The number and percentage of eosinophils and basophils in the peripheral blood were measured before and after the surgery. We also studied RIST and RAST score before surgery. Results: In order to examine the currency of eosinophils and basophils, we examined seven patients who were harvested blood for more than three times.

It usually occurs in inmunocompetent patients with nasal polyps. It is a hypersensitivity fungal reaction. Diagnostic criteria should include the presence of allergic mucin in nasal exudate and typical radiological findings. Method: Four cases of AFRS are described. All patients presented with a history of persistent nasal obstruction, rhinorrea and sinus headaches during several months. Skin prick testing to aeroallergenes and molds (including Aspergillus) were carried out as well as total serum Ig E, specific Ig E and Ig G (CAP-FEIA System) against fungal antigens. An endoscopic sinus surgery was carried out in all patients. Mucoid material was cultured. Results: Immediate hypersensitivity to Aspergillus was detected by positive skin prick testing (3/4 patients) and increased levels of specific Ig E (4/4 patients). Total serum Ig E levels were elevated in all cases. Allergic mucin was found in nasal discharge in all patients. Fungal culture was positive in nasal exudate of three patients. Aspergillus could be demonstrated in the histopathology of a patient. ACT showed non invasive heterogeneous density in all cases. Conclusion: AFRS should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients with chronic refractory sinusitis, particularly in those with nasal polyps and atopic background.

Background: Drug hypersensitivity reactions to non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequent and can be distinguished to several subtypes, among which the single NSAID-induced urticariaangioedema/anaphylaxis. The diagnostic approach for this reaction type includes skin testing with the culprit drug and oral challenges (OC) to NSAIDs with different chemical structure. We present a case of near fatal anaphylaxis to diclofenac who experienced additionally systemic reaction during skin testing with the culprit drug. Method: A 62-year-old male with no medical history received p.o. 100 mg of diclofenac, due to low back pain. Three minutes later he developed a generalised flushing with intense itching and burning sensation, followed in 5 min by lightheadedness, loss of consciousness and fecal incontinence. His relatives performed basic cardiac resuscitation; hence he regained consciousness in 5 min. He was able to reach the Emergency Dpt. 90 min later, presenting only with generalised mild erythema. He was treated with i.v. corticosteroids and antihistamines and a serum sample for tryptase was immediately obtained. The patient reported uneventful recent intake of mefenamic acid and ibuprofen, while 3 years ago after diclofenac intake he experienced urticarial lesions lasting 1 h. Thirty days after the anaphylactic episode, skin prick tests(SPTs) to 1/1000, 1/100 1/10-fold dilution of diclofenac 25 mg/ml, as well as undiluted, were performed in 20 min intervals, followed by intradermal tests(IDs) of 1/10000, 1/1000, 1/100(twice) and 1/10-fold dilutions. An OC to acetylsalicylic acid up to 500 mg was also carried out. Results: Tryptase concentration at the episode was 64.6 lg/ml (basal 6.6 lg/ml). All SPTs and IDs were negative. Surprisingly enough, 20 min after the second 1/100 ID, the patient experienced a mild pruritus in the palms, which retreated in a few minutes. However 20 min after the 1/10 ID test a generalised flushing, highly pruritic, appeared accompanied by increased heart rate(110/min). The reaction subsided upon treatment within 30 min. Two weeks later, the OC to aspirin was negative. The patient obtained written instructions for strict avoidance of diclofenac and acetic acid derivatives. Background: Anaphylaxis is an immediate life threatening reaction that usually initiates within a few minutes after exposure to the trigger factor. The occurrence of anaphylaxis without any identifiable precipitating factor is described as idiopathic anaphylaxis which frequently affects adult females. Idiopathic anaphylaxis tends to be recurrent and the occurrence of two or more episodes in the previous 2 months or at least six episodes in the preceding year is defined as frequent idiopathic anaphylaxis. Here we describe a case of frequent idiopathic anaphylaxis attacks. Case presentation: A 17-year-old female, referred to our center with recurrent attacks of anaphylaxis without any identifiable trigger that initiated about 4-5 years ago. She had recently experienced more frequent episodes, up to three attacks daily (about 17 episodes during the previous 2 weeks). She had a history of recurrent acute urticaria, eczema and allergic rhinitis. She was the 2nd child of non-related parents with a family history of allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria. She was a wellnourished and well-developed girl and there wasn't any significant physical abnormal finding except for mild eczematous lesions on the extensor surface of her extremities.

Although anaphylactic reactions to Gonadotropin releasing hormone analogues that have been used for treatment such as triptorelin acetate and leuprolide acetate have been previously reported; life-threatening reactions to gonadorelin acetate is extremely rare. Herein, we describe the first case -to the best of our knowledge-who encountered severe anaphylaxis after intravenous gonadorelin acetate administration. Case report: An 8-year-old girl who was diagnosed with central precocious puberty was receiving triptorelin acetate uneventfully for 7 months. In order to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment, LHRH test with gonadorelin acetate was planned. Within 3 min after intravenous administration of gonadorelin acetate, she lost her consciousness whereas tonic seizures started in her hands and feet. She developed generalised hives along with edema in her tongue, lips and eyelids. Cyanosis was also present and she had hypotension (60/30 mmHg). Based on the diagnosis of anaphylactic shock by gonadorelin acetate infusion, she was immediately treated with epinephrine, high-flow oxygen, diphenhydramine and fluids. Her vital signs including blood pressure and pulse rate recovered within 30 min. Although the patient recovered successfully in 6 h, she was hospitalised for monitoring of her vital signs and discharged without any further events. Skin test with gonadorelin acetate was planned; however it could not be performed due to unwillingness of her parents. Conclusion: Gonadotropin releasing hormone analogues, particularly gonadorelin acetate is generally regarded as safe drugs. However, life threatening anaphylactic reactions can be encountered. Severe systemic reactions during the procedure should be anticipated and administration of these drugs should be performed in a setting that is equipped to deal with anaphylactic reactions. Background: We report the case of a patient who developed acute coronary syndrome without ST elevation under treatment with ibuprofen by pain secondary to left ankle sprain. This is non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAIDs) on a daily basis, making this class of drugs one of the most commonly used in the world. This has been seen as a reaction very unlikely. There are few cases described in the literature related to myocardial ischemia and nonsteridal antiinflammatory. Method: A 72-years-old man, immediately after taking tablet oral ibuprofen 600 mg, presented the following symptoms: lightheaded, pale skin, cold sweats, loss of consciousness, malaise, hypotension (70/40), decrease in oxygen saturation (92%), angioedema of lips, conjunctival injection, itching and generalised maculopapular rash with rapid onset. He goes to the emergency room where the patient was treated with Antihitamines and intravenous steroids improving his symptoms. So the patient was assessed by coronary care service of cardiology after suffering a syncope; finding elevated Troponin. Result: Troponin level was 11.57 ng/ml (enzyme indicative of myocardial damage). EKG: no evidence of myocardial ischemia or ST elevation. Echocardiogram: normal ejection fraction. Stress echocardiography: negative for myocardial ischemia. Total IgE: 611 IU/ml. Serum tryptase levels obtained 60 min later measured 148 mcg/l and 48 h later 7.24 mcg/l (this is one of the main markers of anaphylaxis). Skin prick test with Ibuprofen was negative. Controlled oral exposure test whit Celecoxib (200 mg) and Paracetamol (500 mg) were negative, tolerated therapeutic doses. Conclusion: As it is known, Ibuprofen is a common cause of allergic reactions drug. In our knowledge, few cardiac manifestations have been described in the medical literature. We report the case of a patient in which we observed predominantly cardiac involvement as a result of anaphylactic reaction caused by ibuprofen.

The anesthetic protocol also included i.v. acetaminophen and lidocaine at the lumbar area. Due to the severity of the reaction it was decided to start the investigation with laboratory tests. Basophils Activation Test was positive for local anesthetics and negative for acetaminophen. Skin prick tests excluded latex and iodopovidone allergy. Intradermal tests (IT) with midazolam were negative and oral provocation test with acetaminophen was also negative. Diagnosis of allergy to local anesthetics was presumed. The patient was then submitted to general anesthesia without any adverse reaction. Case 2: Female, 60 years old, who had respiratory arrest and urticaria during general anesthesia protocol. Symptoms started 15 min after the administration of rocuronium. Propofol and midazolam had already been administrated. IT were positive for all muscle relaxants (except atracurium) and negative for midazolam and propofol. Skin prick tests for latex, iodopovidone and eggwhite were also negative. The patient was submitted to surgery with atracurium as an alternative muscle relaxant with no complications. Case 3: Female, 37 years old, who had hypotension, respiratory distress and generalised urticaria during epidural anesthesia for Cesarean section. Besides the anesthetic drugs, cefixime was also administrated. Skin prick tests were positive for latex. IT for anesthetic drugs and oral provocation with cefixime were negative. Diagnosis of latex allergy was confirmed by positive latex specific IgE. Conclusion: Most anaphylactic reactions during anesthetic induction are allergic and therefore further exposures to the same drug may induce severe reactions. Diagnosis is not always easy and similar clinical cases can be caused by different drugs. With these three case reports we emphasize that a thorough allergic workup is crucial for the identification of the culprit drug and to find safer alternatives.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Allergic fungal rhinosinusitis in four adult patients"}, {"text": "The combination of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and a betablocker aggravates passive systemic anaphylaxis in mice Background: The beta-blocker metoprolol and the angiotensin converting enzyme ACE-inhibitor ramipril are frequently used for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. These drugs have been reported to augment anaphylactic responses in sensitive individuals, but the mechanisms behind this effect remain to be determined. Method: We established a mouse model which mimics the long term treatment in cardiovascular therapy. To this end, Balb/c mice were pre-treated with ramipril and metoprolol (either alone or in combination) for 14 days and passive systemic anaphylaxis (PSA) was induced. Core body temperature was measured up to 70 min. Levels of mast cell (MC) mediators were determined by ELISA. Additionally, we used the model of passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA). In vitro, murine bone marrow-derived cultured mast cells were incubated with the drugs, sensitised with IgE and treated with (or without) anti-IgE before histamine release was assessed. Results: Pre-treatment of the mice with either ramipril or metoprolol alone showed only slight enhancing effects on hypothermia. However the combination clearly potentiated the symptoms of PSA. These effects were confirmed in the passive cutaneous model. In line with the exacerbated hypothermia, elevated amounts of LTC 4 and PGD 2 as well as increased levels of the pre-formed mediators histamine and serotonin were detected in mouse sera upon combined treatment with the respective drugs. Consistent with these findings histamine release of MCs pre-treated with metoprolol in vitro was likewise enhanced.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1407, "end": 1408, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1434"}, {"text": "The combination of ramipril and metoprolol potentiates PSA and PCA.

Background: The aim of the research is to investigate the prevalence of anaphylactic shock in industrial city (Kazan, Russia, more 1 million population) within the period of 2000-2011. We've analysed the medical records of patients with acute allergic reactions, treated in the allergology department of the local hospital. Method: There have been hospitalised 493 patients 14-80 years old (274 women and 219 men) with diagnosis 'Anaphylactic shock'. The prevalence of the anaphilactic shock has increased from 3.1 per 100 000 of population in 2000 up to 4.3 per 100 000 in 2011. Results: Among the etiological reasons of the anaphylactic shock there are 291 cases of drug allergy (60%), 133 caseshymenoptera sting (27%), 34 cases of food allergy (7%), 31 cases (6%) are included into the group, named 'other'.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion:"}, {"text": "Anaphylactic shock caused by drugs takes the third place in the structure of acute allergic reaction of same genesis after the acute urticaria and angioedema, and acute dermatitis.

However, selective reaction to single NSAID resembling type I hypersensitivity has been sporadically reported. Aceclofenac and diclofenac are widely used NSAID derivative of phenylacetic acid. Selective hypersensitivity reaction to aceclofenac has been rarely reported, and there is no report about cross-reactivity between aceclofenac and diclofenac. This study was performed to investigate pathogenic mechanism of selective anaphylactic reaction to aceclofenac, and to evaluate cross-reactivity between aceclofenac and diclofenac. Case presentation: Three female patients with aceclofenac-induced anaphylaxis were enrolled. All three patients had definite history of anaphylactic shock to aceclofenac, and two patients also had episode of anaphylaxis to diclofenac. However, all were tolerable to aspirin or other NSAIDs. Skin test with aceclofenac, diclofenac, aspirin and other NSAIDs were performed. One patient showed positive response to aceclofenac and diclofenac both in prick and intradermal tests. Another patient showed positive intradermal response to aceclofenac and diclofenac, but the other patient showed negative skin reactivity to all test drugs. Oral provocation test with aspirin and other NSAIDs showed no specific response in all patients, even though the challenge tests with aceclofenac or diclofenac could not be performed because of the risk. To detect serum-specific IgE, we prepared aceclofenac-and diclofenac-human serum albumin (HSA) conjugates respectively. ELISA result showed high level of specific IgE to aceclofenac-and diclofenac-HSA conjugates in sera from two patients with positive skin response to the drug. ELISA inhibition tests showed significant inhibitions of specific IgE responses with additions of aceclofenac-and diclofenac-HSA conjugates in dose-dependent manners in these two sera. Conclusion: In conclusion, we demonstrated the presence of specific IgE to aceclofenac-and diclofenac-HSA conjugates in two patients with selective hypersensitivity to these drugs. We also showed immunologic cross-reactivity between aceclofenac and diclofenac. These results suggest specific IgE-mediated mechanism of phenylacetic acid-induced anaphylaxis by clinical history, skin tests and specific IgE measurement. Background: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) frequently occur in hospital setting and affect negatively patient outcomes. The number of self-reported ADRs has been rapidly increased in Korea. This study was conducted to investigate the clinical characteristics of ADRs in a single university hospital, and to evaluate the features of ADRs to anti-asthma or anti-allergic drugs in patients with allergic diseases. Method: ADRs reported to hospital Pharmacovigilance Center were collected from Jan 2012 to Dec 2012. Assessment was performed for causality and severity. Clinical information was also collected from electronic medical records. Results: The total number of ADRs through spontaneous reporting system was 2673. Among them, 1693(63.3%) were reported from female, and 35.4% were reported from patient aged 60 and over. ADRs were reported by doctors (36.5%), nurses (39.7%), and hospital pharmacists (23.8%). Central nervous system (CNS) agents and anti-infective agents (AIA) were the drug class most commonly involved, and NSAIDs and cephalosporin antibiotics were the most frequently offending subclass. The most frequently reported systemorgan class was GI system disorders (33.9%), and skin and appendages disorders (22.1%) were the next. Serious adverse events (SAE) were developed in 109 cases (4.1%), severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR) such as DRESS syndrome and Stevens-Johnson syndrome were noted in 17 cases. About 6.9% of total ADRs were severe in severity. Compared to ADRs reported from doctor or pharmacists, severity of ADR reported from nurses was more mild form (P < 0.01). Eighty-five ADRs (3.2%) were developed against antiasthmatic or anti-allergic drugs. Most of them were mild (71.8%) and moderate (24.7%) in severity. Anti-histamines (29 of 85) were the most commonly involved drugs in these classes. ADRs to inhaled steroids with/without LABA (9) and LTRA (4) were also reported. Conclusion: Nurses report relatively mild ADRs, however, doctors and pharmacists may have tendency to report more severe cases of ADRS. Anti-infectives and NSA-IDs can elicit ADRs most frequently. Although the severity is usually mild or moderate, ADRs to anti-asthmatics or anti-allergic drugs are not uncommon in patients with allergic diseases in university hospital setting. Background: Hypersensitivity reactions to betalactam antibiotics are common during childhood. Studies have shown that 12-60% of children with suspected allergy were actually allergic to betalactams. The aim of this study is to determine the rate and risk factors for betalactam allergy in children with history of immediate and nonimmediate hypersensitivity reactions. Method: We performed a prospective study of 105 children [6.25 (3.62-9.41 ) years] who had 128 hypersensitivity reactions to betalactams. After filling ENDA questionnaire, all cases underwent prick and intradermal skin testing with major and minor determinant mixture, penicillin G, ampicillin, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid followed by the culprit drug. In patients with a history of nonimmediate reaction and negative skin tests, patch tests and intradermal tests with late readings were performed with the culprit drug. Drug provocation test was performed in case of negative interventional tests. Results: Thirty-four children (32.4%) had 39 immediate and 71 children (67.6%) had 89 nonimmediate reactions in the history. The most frequently incriminated drugs were amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (47.7%), penicilin (14.8%), cephalosporins (22%), sulbactam ampicillin (7%), amoxicillin (5.5%), ampicillin (2.3%), meropenem (0.8%). Eight children with an immediate reaction (23.5%) and 13 children with a nonimmediate reaction (18.3%) were diagnosed as betalactam allergic. The diagnosis of drug allergy was determined by skin tests (n = 6), provocation test (n = 1) and doctor diagnosed anaphylaxis in our hospital (n = 1) in immediate reactions whereas by skin tests (n = 3), patch tests (n = 2) and provocation tests (n = 9) in nonimmediate reactions. Respiratory system involvement during the drug reaction was found to increase the risk for diagnosis of betalactam allergy in immediate reactions in children (OR:6.9, 95% CI:1.3-37.5, P = 0.024).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 4300, "end": 4303, "text": "(9)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 5148, "end": 5158, "text": "(3.62-9.41", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion:"}, {"text": "Corticosteroid use for the treatment of acute drug reaction was associated with higher risk for diagnosis of nonimmediate betalactam allergy (OR:4.3, 95% CI:1.2-15.7, P = 0.025). Conclusion: Diagnosis of drug allergy is also common in children with a history of nonimmediate reactions to betalactams. In the majority of cases, the drug allergy was confirmed by skin tests in immediate reactions whereas by drug provocation in nonimmediate reactions. A detailed history of drug reaction including the treatments given for the reaction itself is important for an appropriate diagnostic work up. Background: Abacavir is an antiretroviral drug used as first line treatment for HIV infection. Of treated patients, 5-8% develop an abacavir-associated hypersensitivity syndrome (ABC-HS) in the first 6 weeks, which can be life-threatening. ABC-HS has been strongly associated with the presence of the HLA-B*5701 allele. Screening for this allele is recommended for all patients prior to beginning therapy with abacavir since it virtually eliminates all immunologically confirmed ABC-HS.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion:"}, {"text": "Aim: To determine the prevalence of HLA-B*5701 in the adult HIV population followed in our hospital and to characterise suspected ABC-HS. Methods: Clinical data on patients under abacavir treatment since January 2006 was analyzed to search for symptoms of ABC-HS. HLA-B*5701 screening was performed by real time PCR in all patients since January 2008 and those with positive HLA-B*5701 began HIV treatment with an alternative drug. Reactions of suspected ABC-HS were characterised. HLA-B*5701 and patch tests (1% and 10% abacavir in petrolatum) with readings at 48 h were performed in those without previous testing. Direct costs of ABC-HS were also analyzed. Results: Of 573 patients screened in the 5 year period, 35 (6.1%) were HLA-B*5701 positive. After HLA-B*5701 screening implementation, no suspected ABC-HS were observed. During 2006 and 2007, 186 patients began treatment with abacavir: data was unavailable in 23; 7 (4.3%) patients stopped abacavir for suspected ABC-HS (median age 45 years, five male). The median time for reaction onset was 7 days (0-13 days) after starting abacavir; reactions were characterised by rash (n = 2), fever and malaise (n = 2), rash, fever and myalgia (n = 1), liver enzymes elevation (n = 1) and subjective sensation of dyspnea and throat swelling (n = 1). Two patients were treated with oral corticosteroids; none required hospitalisation. Patch tests and HLA-B*5701 results are currently available in two patients: one patient with pruritic rash in the trunk had positive HLA-B*5701; both had negative patch tests. Conclusions: The prevalence of HLA-B*5701 was of 6.1% and the rate of reactions prior to screening was of 4.3%, in accordance to the described for the European population. Most suspected ABC-HS reactions were either rash or fever and none required hospitalisation. No ABC-HS occurred from January 2008, when HLA-B*5701 screening was implemented. Background: Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions to Drugs (SCARs) are rare, but life-threatening conditions. Case definition for SCARs can help in its early diagnosis and management. There are limited data about the follow-up of these cases. Our aim was to analyze series of cases of SCARs based on the clinical and demographic data and on clinical follow-up. Method: A cohort study was developed including all patients with history of SCARs in the last 10 years. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), Acute Generalised Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) were considered SCARs. The evaluation was based on standardised scoring systems using an adapted ENDA (European Network of Drug Allergy) questionnaire, medical records and on the clinical follow-up in our Allergy Clinic. Results: Thirty-seven cases were validated as probable or definitive SCARs, 15 DRESS, 15 SJS, 4 TEN and 3 AGEP. Nineteen males (51%) and the mean age was 32.5. Mucosal involvement was found in 16 patients (43%), 25% in DRESS. Fever was present in 87% and lymphadenopathy in 41%. Of all 34 subjects (92%) who presented internal organs involvement, predominantly liver (59%), kidney (26%), spleen (15%) and lung (15%) . Forty-one percent had commitment of a single internal organ, 47% of SJS and TEN cases had this involvement. Thirty-three percent of patients with renal involvement required dialysis. Eosinophilia was documented in 24% and atypical lymphocytes in 13.5%. Thirty-five percent were related with antibiotics, 32% with antiepileptics, 19% with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 8% with sulfonamides and 2.7% with allopurinol. Five fatalities (13.5%) occurred, all for sepsis, 60% in TEN. During the follow-up, 35% cases developed skin/mucosa sequelaes, 5.4% autoimmune diseases, 5.4% biliary cholestasis and 5.4% presented different drug allergies to non-related medications. Conclusion: This series confirmed the clinical variability of SCARDS, highlighting skin, fever and internal organs involvement. Antibiotics were the main culprit pharmacological group. There was severe internal organ involvement and most of fatalities were related to sepsis in TEN. The clinical outcomes verified after the acute phase of these reactions, supports the need of a long-lasting clinical follow-up of these patients. Background: To evaluate patients referred to the Allergy Department for suspected betalactam antibiotic allergy. To assess the number of patients with confirmed allergy, drugs involved in reactions and the usefulness of the diagnostic tests. Method: Prospective study in patients who had experienced a reaction suspected to be due to betalactam allergy. Diagnosis was based on ENDA protocol (positive clinical history, specific IgE, cutaneous and/or challenge test). One year after the study, in 40 patients we carried out a telephone survey to find out the usefulness of the diagnostic study based in the final report given to the patient. Results: We studied 154 patients (103 female) with age 44.48 AE 16.13 years old (16-78 years). Suspected drugs were: amoxicillin (32%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (31%), penicillin (30%), ampicillin (3%), cefuroxime (3%) and betalactams (1%). 76% of the patients reported cutaneous manifestations, 3% anaphylactic shock, 7% gastrointestinal involvement and the other, non-specific symptoms. Clinical history was not suggestive in 42% of the patients. 117 patients had a negative challenge test with the suspected drug. Betalactam allergy was diagnosed in 37 patients (24%). 57% of these had suffered anaphylaxis. Two of 29 patients showed positive serum specific IgE antibodies, 18 of 33, positive cutaneous tests and 4 of 4 had a positive challenge test with the suspicious drug. In 14 patients (11 of them with negative cutaneous tests), diagnosis was made by highly positive clinical history. In 2 of 5 patients with negative serum specific IgE antibodies, cutaneous tests were positive. Challenge test with alternative drug was carried out in 26 patients (70%) and in one of them (4%) was positive. The results of telephone survey showed that 14 patients had took and tolerated the recommended drug and in 26 patients the drug was not administered: 18 patients because it was not necessary, 6 patients due to fear and 2 patients still considered themselves allergic despite their negative diagnosis. Conclusion: Only 24% of the patients were diagnosed with allergy to any betalactam antibiotic. Cutaneous tests and, especially, specific IgE show low sensitivity. Most of the patients tolerated an alternative betalactam. One of five patients surveyed did not accept the diagnosis. A greater implication of the family Doctor in interviewing the patients is needed to determine the necessity of referring them to the Allergy unit. Background: The prevalence of hypersensitivity reactions induced by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is unknown, and the present study focuses on predisposing factors, clinical pictures, and allergological work up. Methods: A descriptive cross sectional study using a modified ENDA questionnaire was implemented in 19 allergology units from 11 different Latin American countries; reporting patients assisted for NSAIDs hypersensitivity reactions evaluated in a first visit to a specialist, during the last year. Severity was graded as mild, moderate and severe. Results: Of 564 patients evaluated because of hypersensitivity drug reactions, 302 (53%) presented NSAIDs related reactions. Fifty-six percent had an atopic background. In the group with certain and probable causal relationship with NSAIDs (252 patients), Urticaria-angioedema (85%), was the most prevalent clinical presentation. Maculopapular exanthema was present in 5% of the cases. Immediate reactions (<1 h after taking the drug) were present in 55% of the patients, while only 10% occurred after 24 h. Thirteen percent had a history of previous reactions with drugs of the same group. Seventeen percent of the reactions were severe. Drug provocation tests (DPT) were performed in 123 patients (44%), being positive in 41 (three non immediate reactions). Conclusions: NSAIDs were the most frequent inducer of reactions in our population. A significant factor that may account for such high rate of reactions is the easy access to NSAIDs, as they are Over-thecounter (OTC) medications in most coun-tries. Almost 2/3 of the reactions were immediate, and 17% were severe emphasizing the need for raising awareness among the population and health authorities in Latin America about the potential dangers of self medication.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 830, "end": 845, "text": "During 2006 and", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 846, "end": 855, "text": "2007, 186", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3181, "end": 3186, "text": "(15%)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion:"}, {"text": "Differences between self-reported drug hypersensitivity reactions in Lithuanian adults and children Background: Drug hypersensitivity reactions (DHRs) are the adverse effects of drugs that, when taken at doses generally tolerated by normal subjects, clinically resemble allergy. The aim of our study was to assess the prevalence of self-reported DHRs in adults and in children and to analyse the risk factors in both groups. Method: Cross-sectional survey of a population from Vilnius and Kaunas regions of Lithuania was made. 35 questions about drug allergy symptoms and also about food and pollen allergy, family history were examined. 5370 patients included in the study. 3222 of them were children (1628 females, median age 8.25 [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] years), and 2148 were adults (1247 females, median age 48 [28-63] years) recruited from both adults and children general practices. Results: 7.9% of children and 13.8% of adults declared DHRs for at least one drug (P < 0.001). Female were predominant in adults with DHRs (17.5% vs 8.7%, P < 0.001), but there was no statistical difference for gender in the children. 69.8% of children and 59.5% of adults had skin symptoms like redness, rashes, itch, oedema and these were the most common clinical symptoms in both groups (P = 0.012). Anaphylaxis rate was similar in both groups (about 10%). All other symptoms were significantly more frequent in adults: ocular symptoms were detected in 3.1% of children and 9.5% of adults, nasal symptoms in 1.6% of children and 7.4% of adults, respiratory symptoms in 2% of children and 13.5% of adults, gastrointestinal symptoms in 5.1% of children and 13.2% of adults. In our population the frequency of immediate type DHRs was 60.1% in adults and 25.7% in children (P < 0.001). 4.4% of children and 7.2% of adults had antibiotic induced DHRs and it was the most implicated group of drugs (P < 0.001). Food and pollen allergy was declared more frequent in the DHRs group. Statistically significant risk factors for DHRs were age (OR = 1.017 in favour of adults, 95% CI 1.013-1.021), female sex (OR = 1.439, 95% CI 1.187-1.744), concomitant food (OR = 1.92, 95% CI 1.505-2.448) and pollen allergy (OR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.573-2.544) and family history of DHRs (OR = 6.007, . Conclusion: Self-reported drug hypersensitivity reactions were more frequent in adult females. The skin reactions were dominant in both groups. The risk factors were age, female sex, food allergy, pollen allergy and family history of drug hypersensitivity reactions. Background: An increased prevalence of atopy has been observed in patients with cross-intolerance to non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This association has been observed between inhalant allergens (mainly house dust mites) and several clinical manifestations of crossintolerance to NSAIDs (acute urticaria/angioedema). Whether an association exists with food allergens has not been assessed. The aim of this study was to investigate sensitisation to food allergens in patients diagnosed as acute urticaria/angioedema induced by cross-intolerance to NSAIDs (AUA). Methods: Patients with confirmed history of AUA (\u22653 episodes with at least two different NSAIDs or positive drug provocation test), selective responders to NSAIDs (SR) and subjects who tolerated NSAIDs were included. Skin prick tests were performed with a battery of 31 common food allergens that included animal and vegetable allergens. Specific IgE was determined in serum by ImmunoCAP, considering positive a value higher than 0.35 IU/ml. Results: A total of 80 patients with confirmed history of AUA, 30 SR and 152 controls were studied. The 62.5% were females with a mean age 42.54 AE 14.76 years. Positive skin tests and specific IgE in serum were detected in 3 (3.75%) patients AUA and in 7 (4.6%) controls (P > 0.05). None of SR had positive tests. No differences were found in the allergens tested in both AUA and control groups. Conclusions: Food allergy sensitisation does not seems to be increases in subjects with AUA in spite that these patients are more sensitised to inhalants. Further studies are needed to confirm this finding. Background: Allergic reactions to drugs comprise a major public health problem associated with substantial mortality and morbidity. Recent studies confirmed that drug allergy frequency is overestimated by both parents and physicians. The aim of this study is to find out the frequency and the risk factors for drug allergy in children with a history of allergic drug reaction admitting to a tertiary allergy clinic in Turkey. Method: The children with a history of allergic reaction to any drug admitted to our department within last year were involved. Epidermal, intradermal and/or patch tests and provocation tests according to EAACI-ENDA recommendations. The demographic features, presence of atopic or another chronic disease, concomitant drug use, atopy status and familial atopic status of the patient together with the clinical features of suspected drug reaction were recorded. Results: The children (n = 237) [7.3(3.9-10 .2) years, 96 male] who had a total of 366 allergic reactions attributed to any drug were included. The diagnostic work up was complete in 169 (71.3%) patients with 266 reactions. Suspected reaction history was with one drug in 103 (60.9%) patients, two drugs in 45 (26.6%) patients, three drugs in 17 (10.1%) patients, four and five drugs in two patients. The most frequent suspected reactions were due to antibiotics (59.4%), non-steroidal antiinflamatory drugs (19.1%), chemotherapeutics (3.2%) and local anesthetics (3%). The diagnosis of drug allergy was made in 51 (30.1%) patients, proven by provocation tests (n = 23), skin prick or intradermal tests (n = 12), patch test (n = 2) and doctor diagnosed anaphylaxis in our hospital (n = 14). The frequency of atopy, food sensitisation, chronic disease and concomitant chronic drug use were higher in drug aller-gic patients compared to nonallergic ones (P = 0.002, 0.021, 0.031, 0.003, respectively). Angioedema [(OR: 2.8, , P = 0.002)], vomiting [(OR:8.1, , P = 0.018) and coughing in the reaction history increased the risk for actual drug allergy in multivariate regression analysis. Conclusion: One third of the patients who were tested for suspected drug allergy were diagnosed as drug allergic in a tertiary allergy clinic in Turkey. Higher frequency of atopy and food sensitisation in patients with drug allergy might point a tendency of atopic individuals to hypersensitivity to drugs. Angioedema, vomitting and coughing in history were associated with actual drug allergy after diagnostic work up.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 733, "end": 736, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 737, "end": 740, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 741, "end": 744, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 745, "end": 748, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 749, "end": 752, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 753, "end": 756, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 757, "end": 760, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 761, "end": 765, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 766, "end": 770, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 771, "end": 775, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 776, "end": 780, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 781, "end": 785, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5101, "end": 5112, "text": "[7.3(3.9-10", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6080, "end": 6090, "text": "[(OR: 2.8,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6115, "end": 6124, "text": "[(OR:8.1,", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1444"}, {"text": "Background: Adverse reactions to iodinated contrast agents (MCI) are uncommon since the appearance of nonionic lowosmolality contrast media.

Results: Eighty two patients reporting a history of adverse reaction to MCI were referred to our outpatient clinic. The reactions were more frequent in women (54.8%); median age was 59 (range: 21-85 years), and 20% had atopy. Iohexol was administered for computed tomography (78%) and Iodixanol for coronariography (11%) and urography (11%). The total number of reactions was: 18 to Iodixanol (12 immediate and six delayed) and 64 to Iohexol (35 immediate and 29 delayed). The reactions were: mild (70%), moderate (15%) and severe (15%) . Clinical symptoms were: cutaneous 60% (rash, urticaria, angioedema and/or pruritus), nonspecific 24% (nausea, vomiting, dizziness and hot flushes) and systemic 14% (anaphylaxis, dyspnea, chest pain and loss of consciousness) of cases. One subject with anaphylaxis had positive skin testing (prick and intradermal test) to Iohexol (1.6%). Another patient suffered from exanthematous pustulosis caused by Iodixanol and confirmed by histopathology skin biopsy. Conclusion: Adverse reactions were more frequent to Iohexol and the severity of reactions was associated mainly to Iodixanol. IgE mediated reactions were uncommon. In all patients challenges were carried out in order to confirm tolerance to other NSA-IDs. The reactions were caused by metamizol in 29 (40.84%), followed by ibuprofen 20 (28.16%), diclofenac 6 (8.45%), paracetamol 5 (7.04%), etoricoxib 3 (4.22%), dexketoprofen 3 (4.22%), naproxen 3 (4.22%), AAS 1(1.40%) and piroxicam 1 (1.40%). The diagnostic test realised were positive in 17 patients (23, 94%), skin test positive in 12 (16.90%), nine intradermal reaction (all to metamizol) and three in patch test (one metamizol, one etoricoxib and one paracetamol).

Bajrovic, N; Topole, E University Clinic for Pulmonary and Allergic Diseases Golnik, Golnik, Slovenia Background: Non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) represent one of the most frequent causes of drug-induced urticaria/angioedema worldwide. Almost 30% of patients with chronic urticaria (CU) develop hives after ingestion of NSAIDs. Method: In the first partretrospective analysis we reviewed data of all patients that were tested for NSAID hypersensitivity and had positive history of NSAID intolerance from 1.1.2007 to 31.12 .2010 at our clinic (medical data from medical database BIRPIS). Among those we focused on a group of patients who had urticaria as a leading symptom of hypersensitivity reaction to NSAID. We also conducted a follow up part of the study in which we interviewed patients after a 5 year period, to establish if during this period they had had any symptoms of chronic urticaria. Results: In a 4-year period we tested 569 patients (387 women -68%, 182 men -32%) with positive history of hypersensitivity to NSAIDs. Among all tested subjects 324 patients (56.9%) had a history of urticaria as a leading symptom of reaction. Among these, 98 patients (30.2%; 62 women and 36 men) had a history suggesting existing chronic urticaria (but none with previously confirmed diagnosis of CU) prior or soon after the reaction (but before testing) to single or multiple NSA-IDs. The most frequently reported drug that caused urticaria was naproxen, followed by ASA paracetamol. We tested all of these patients with one or more NSA-IDs. Eighty-six patients (78.8%) had negative tests and only 12 positive. In patients that had negative tests the most frequently used drug was paracetmaol and least used drug were pyrazolones.

The final number of patients with no history of spontaneous urticaria prior to NSAID reaction/testing and recently reported spontaneous hives was 14 (20.3%). Conclusion: We found important discordance between history and test results; in our group only 12.2% patients have had positive tests. In a follow up only one fifth of patients (20.3%) with no previous history of spontaneous urticaria have developed spontaneous episodes of urticaria. Background: Great effort has been made to clarify and classify hypersensitivity reactions caused by NSAIDs; however few data exist on compliance with drug avoidance and the use of alternative medications. The goal of this study is to evaluate the adherence of patients to written instructions regarding management of their NSAIDs hypersensitivity. Additionally, the incidence of urticaria in this population was appraised. Method: Seventy-eight patients (\u2640 59, mean age 48 years, range 19-84) were included in study analysis. The compliance was evaluated by phone interview using a standard questionnaire with specific parameters: time interval from last consultation (mean interval 25 months, range 3 month-5 years), necessity to receive NSAID, NSAID intake and specific agent used, reason of intake-accidental or intentional-and occurrence of chronic spontaneous urticaria). Results: Fifty five out of 78 pts (70.5%) avoided all NSAIDs or have been using only paracetamol; 29/55, were instructed to use alternative NSAIDs; 12/29 were advised to use COX-2 inhibitors, 8/29 were allowed to take all NSAIDs, 7/29 had to avoid the specific culprit drug and 2/29 oxicame derivatives. Twenty six out of 55 did not complete the diagnostic procedures due to risk-benefit considerations or denial to consent and were given stricter avoidance instructions. Although several reported paracetamol to be insufficient for pain relief, they still refrained from using other medication, due to NSAID pharmacopho-bia. No reaction was reported following inadvertent or intentional exposure to the culprit drugs. Additionally, 3 out of 78 reported symptoms of chronic spontaneous urticaria during this period. Conclusion: In their majority, the patients in our population disregarded the written instructions and -spurred by a fear of reaction-refrained from using allowed medication. Effective patient-doctor communication is of cardinal importance in an effort to improve adherence and therefore, the patients' quality of life. Accordingly, a simple but concise explanation of the reasoning behind said instructions will go a long way into improving the patients compliance to them.

She initiated Humalog \u2122 (insuline lispro) in the morning and Insulatard \u2122 (insuline isophane) at night. After 4 weeks of treatment, she noted the onset of a pruritic and erythematous papule (2 cm diameter), arising within 2-3 h at the site of subcutaneous administration of both types of insulin. The papule lasted for 24 h and disappeared without a skin mark. Splitting of the dose, changing the needles and the injection sites were not successful in resolving the reaction.

These results establish the diagnosis of a IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to human insulin and insulin analogues lispro and aspart. A potential hypersensitivity against excipients was excluded only to protamine because other allergic documented excipients are not available in our hospital to be tested, as metacresol and zinc. Conclusion: This case corroborates the allergenic potential of insulin analogues. Also shows the difficulty in the management of insulin allergy due to the inability to test all the components of the commercial preparations. Many times ongoing treatment with insulin is essential and these patients should involve a multidisciplinary team.

It is a self-limited disorder that resolves within 1-2 weeks. We report a case of AGEP after the intake of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and we underline the importance of patch tests for the confirmation of the causative drug. Method: A 37-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital complaining for fever (up to 40\u00b0C) and papular pruritic skin rash affecting the trunk and limbs which had appeared 12 h prior to admis-sion. The patient was under treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid due to periodontitis. The patient's clinical assessment revealed numerous erythematous, non-follicular pustules (<5 mm in diameter), painfull lymphadenopathy and tachycardia. Physical examination was otherwise normal. Laboratory investigations showed mild leukocytosis (WBC: 11 800/mm 3 ). Serologic screening for Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B virus, parvovirus and mycoplasma was negative. Bacterial culture of the pustule and blood revealed no growth of microorganisms and mercury serum levels were below toxic levels. A skin biopsy was consistent with AGEP.

Surprisingly enough, cross-reactivity among ranitidine and cimetidine, but not famotidine, was demonstrated in both cases. In literature, only few reports of cross-reactivity among H2-receptor antagonists exist so far. To our knowledge, this is the first report of exclusive cross-reactivity between these two commonly prescribed H2-antagonists. Background: Non-immediate type hypersensitivity reactions due to antituberculosis drugs are rare but can be life threatening. Diagnostic evaluation is important, because of the multiple drug combination necessity and the restricted number of drugs. Cases: Three multi drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients with delayed type drug hypersensitivity reactions, their and control subjects' patch test results will be presented. Allergic reactions were presented as dermatitis in two patients, toxic epidermal necrolisis (TEN) in one patient. Improvement was acquired for skin lesions after appropriate treatment. Then, patch tests were performed. 1/1 and 1/10 concentrations were applied to the dermatitis patients. In TEN patient, thiacetazone was removed from the treatment. Intra-group variation was made for the drugs which have alternatives. Then, patch tests with the decided drugs were performed with 1/ 100, 1/10 and 1/1 concentrations on separate days. Sixteen control subjects were also tested with the same concentrations of the drugs. Patch test results were positive for cycloserine (CYC) and amikacin (AMK) in the first and for CYC in the second dermatitis patient. Positivity were seen at 1/10 and 1/1 concentrations in these patients. In 8 of 16 control subjects CYC patch tests were positive only at 1/1 concentrations. TEN patient had no positivity in patch tests but as a result of the obligation, drugs were re-challenged cautiously with gradually increasing doses. In all of the patients, culprit drugs were stopped, a new regimen composed and drugs were given with gradually increasing doses on 2 days. TEN patient developed a generalised erythema after 45 min of first day's full dose of PAS. Reaction improved immediately after steroid and antihistamine applications. No reactions occurred with other drugs. All patients completed the therapy and cured from MDR-TB. Conclusion: Drug patch tests guided successful therapies in a life treating disease. However they have limited efficacy in TEN. v Background: Although bendamustine was first synthesised in 1963, scarce adverse reactions have been described so far. Method: A 63-year old man, diagnosed with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) refractory to rituximab. He received treatment with bendamustine, for the first time, during three cycles. In each of the first two, he had generalised tremor and fever of 39\u00b0C, 3 h after the infusion was completed. The symptoms disappeared after treatment with acetaminophen 650 mg. About 3 h after the third cycle of bendamustine he began with generalised tremor, generalised erythema, dizziness and fever of 39\u00b0C. The symptoms were not resolved with acetaminophen as in previous reactions. At the emergency room, a blood pressure of 87/48 mmHg was verified, as well as a paroxistical auricular fibrillation and a mild renal failure. This episode ceased with acetaminophen 1 grame and an adequate hydration. The symptoms disappeared within the first 24 h, without residual skin lesions.

Penicillin group antibiotics are frequent reasons of such reactions, although other antibiotics can occasionally cause such reactions too. We hereby present a case of anaphylaxis that developed during oral drug provocation. The drug was macrolide, which is a rare cause of such a reaction. Case: 39 years-old woman applied to our clinic due to a drug allergy reaction. Past medical history revealed an anaphylactic reaction that happened 15 years ago due to intake of penadur-LA flacon (benzathine penicilline-G). Also, a dry itching and urticaria that happaned twice 3 years ago after intake of Largopen (amoxicilline) and Augmentine (amoxicilline -clavulanic acid) was also reported. To offer the patient a safe antibiotic, we planned a prick test and oral provocation tes with clarithromycine. The result was negative. Following this, oral provocation with a placebo drug was done. There was no reaction. When \u00bc clarithromycine was given, a dry itching was observed after 20 min. With inspection, there was only a hyperemia on the places scratched by the patient. Then the patient was given another dose of placebo. There was no reaction. After this, another \u00bc of clarithromycine was given to the patient. A generalised dry itching was observed 15 min later. Then, restlessnes, a sense of fullness in the throat, difficulty of swallowing and a sense of heaviness in the head were added to the complaints. At the beginning, TA was 140/90 mmHg. So an IV Avil amp 1 9 1 and prednol 40 mg 1 9 1 IV were administered. Oropharynx was observed as hyperemic and edematous, being prominent in uvula and soft palate. In follow-up, TA fell down to 80/60 mmHg. The sense of fullness in the throat had increased. Then, adrenalin 03 ml SC was injected and anaphylaxis protocol was applied. The patient's status became stabilised afterwards. Conclusion: Dry itching can be an important indicator of anaphylaxis. This should alert us for allergic reactions and the oral provocation should be discontinued promptly. We should take into account the probability that clarithromycine, too, can cause anaphylaxis.

We observed the most significant association with adult asthma at rs404860 in the MHC region, which is close to rs2070600, a SNP previously reported for association with FEV1/ FVC in GWAS for lung function. We also identified eight new susceptibility loci of atopic dermatitis with genome-wide significance: IL1RL1-IL18R1-IL18RAP, the MHC region, OR10A3-NLRP10, GLB1, CCDC80, CARD11, ZNF365 and CYP24A1-PFDN4.

After dietary intake or cutaneous production, vitamin D is metabolized to its major circulating stable form 25(OH)D by CYP27A1 in liver or CYP2R1 in microsome and further to 1a, 25 (OH) 2 D. This active vitamin D is transported to blood vessel and then nuclei by the group-specific components vitamin D binging protein (GC:VDBP) and binds to vitamin D receptor (VDR). This study investigated the genetic associations between asthma phenotypes and singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of vitamin D pathway genes. Methods: Twenty SNPs from the above four genes were genotyped in 914 asthma and 1231 non-allergic controls, who were all southern Chinese in ethnicity. Results: Two previous association studies which were carried out in northern China reported two common GC functional SNPs, rs4588 and rs7041, and one VDR SNP rs7975232 to be associated with asthma. Only rs7041 was found associated with asthma under recessive model (P = 0.049). A novel SNP rs645163 in CYP27A1 has association under additive (P = 0.018) and dominant (P = 0.022) models. None of these remained significant after Bonferroni correction. A GC haplotype rs2282679-rs4588-rs7041 showed dif-ferent frequencies between asthma and control. The wild-type ACT is more common among asthmatics (0.436) than controls (0.395) (P = 0.007) whereas ACG is protective against asthma (0.289 vs 0.327; P = 0.008). Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ) was associated with rs7935792 in CYP2R1 under recessive model among 458 asthmatics, adjusted for age, sex and inhaled steroid usage as covariates. Subjects homozygous for minor alleles had significantly higher FEV 1 (108.2 AE 26.8%) than those with wild-type alleles (91.7 AE 17.3%) and the heterozygote (90.9 AE 18.2%) (P = 0.002). The same haplotype under recessive model was also associated with forced vital capacity (FVC) (P = 0.014), although such did not satisfy Bonferroni correction. Significant associations were also found between FEV 1 /FVC and three other CYP2R1 SNPs. Conclusions: This study detects an association between a novel SNP in CYP27A1 and lung function but not asthma diagnosis in Chinese children. We suggest to measure serum vitamin D levels in order to better understand the relationship between asthma and vitamin D.

Studies have demonstrated their efficacy in reducing asthma symptoms, controlling airway inflammation and improving quality of life. GCs exert their therapeutic effects by binding and forming a complex with the intracellular GC receptor. This complex is activated and translocates into the nucleus to directly alter transcription of genes involved in inflammation. The aim of the study was to investigate the association of gene polymorphisms with the susceptibility to asthma and determine whether variants in the genes of glucocorticoid receptor [GR (rs41423247)] and corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1 (rs242939, rs1876828) are associated with clinical response to inhaled corticosteroids treatment. Method: A total of 1137 unrelated participants of Russian, Tatar and Bashkir ethnic groups were recruited, including 702 patients with asthma and 435 non-atopic individuals from the Volga-Ural region of Russia.

T cells and IgE-mediated responses are key factors in the development of allergic asthma. It was reported that RA could regulate the IgE production in inflamatory processes. All-trans-retinoic acid (at-RA) transactivates downstream target genes by binding to retinoic acid receptors (RARs, RXRs). RARs bind to retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) recruiting a protein complex to activate transcription. The prostanoid D receptor gene (PTGDR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor ubiquitously expressed that binds PGD2. It has been identified as an asthmasusceptibility gene. The objective of this work was to investigate the possible role of RA as regulator of the PTGDR gene transcription. Method: MatInspector and TESS software were used for an initial in silico analysis of PTGDR promoter region. A construction of pGL3-PTGDR bearing 700 pb of PTGDR promoter region was transfected into the A549 cell line. Luciferase assays were performed using the Dual Luciferase Reporter System. Firefly luciferase measurements were normalised to Renilla luciferase measurements as a control for transfection efficiency. Cells were treated with at-RA. Real-time PCR was used to measure gene expression and Luciferase assays to analyze the promoter activity of PTGDR. A retinoid responsive CYP26A1 gene, was used as positive control. Results: Bioinformatic analysis identified RARE elements in the PTGDR promoter region. The expression of PTGDR and RARs in response to RA was firstly analyzed in A549 cells pretreated cells. After at-RA treatment, elevated levels of CYP26A1 and RAR isoform b were detected. This increase was maintained until 48 h after at-RA treatment. The A549 cell line transiently transfected with pGL3-PTGDR bearing 700 pb of PTGDR promoter region and treated with at-RA showed an increase in the PTGDR expression of 1.5 fold. Conclusion: The findings presented in this study suggest that PTGDR would be regulated by RA via RARs.

A variety of cytokines, as family of interleukin-1 (IL-1), are involved in the development of different illness. Each of the genes of the IL-1 locus on chromosome 2 is polymorphic: Interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1A), Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1B) and receptor antagonist for Interleukin 1 (IL-1RN). The functional expressions of some gene polymorphisms have been correlated with a wide range of chronic inflammatory conditions, including allergic asthma. This study was performed in order to analyze the genetic profile of IL-1B and IL-1RN cytokines in Venezuelan population. Method: IL-1RN (intron 2) 86 pb pentaallelic Variable Number Tandem Repeats (VNTR) and IL-1B +3953 C>T (exon 5) polymorphisms were genotyped by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) techniques respectively in 100 asthmatics and 100 non-allergic controls with the same ethnicity. Serum total IgE level was measured by enzyme immunoassay. The strength of association between this pair of genes in patients and controls was estimated by the odds ratio (OR) after performing Fisher's exact test. Haplotypes frequencies and linkage disequilibrium were estimated using the Expectation Maximisation algorithm (ELM) implemented in the SNPalyze software package.

There are inter-individual differences in IL1B expression which may be due to single nucleotide polymorphisms in the regulatory regions of the gene. In our study we investigated the -31 T/C polymorphism in the regulation of the IL1B gene in asthmatic children and healthy subjects. Method: We analysed 497 subjects (12.71 AE 0.36 years).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1486"}, {"text": "Genotyping of healthy and affected individuals with bronchial athma was realised using PCR-restric-tion fragment length polymorphism technique.

Results: The IL1B TT genotype at position -31 was significantly higher in the patient group with bronchial asthma (45.6% in patients vs 7.6% in healthy children, P < 0.0001). The allele frequency of T allele was also significantly higher in asthmatic children (62.8% in patients vs 28.5% in healthy children, P < 0.0001). Conclusion: The -31T/C polymorphism of interleukin 1b is located in the core promoter (a TATA box) and may affect the binding of transcription factors and thereby promoter activity. The C allele disrupts this box and reduces binding and induction; hence suggesting that the T allele may be proinflammatory because of enhanced binding of transcription factors. In consequence, the presence of T allele is associated with increase in the production of interleukin 1b and may be responsible for promotion and persistence of chronic inflammation in children with bronchial asthma.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "-31C/T polymorphism of the interleukin 1b gene in children with bronchial asthma"}, {"text": "1488 Polymorphisms in 17q12-21 region interact with pet exposure in relation to asthma presence and asthma severity Background: Polymorphisms in 17q12-21 region are associated with asthma across different populations, but possible geneenvironment interactions have rarely been investigated. We sought to investigate the possible interaction between genes in this region and pet (cat and dog) ownership amongst Croatian schoolchildren. Method: In a case-control study, we recruited 423 children with asthma and 414 controls aged 5-18 years. Fifty-one haplotype tagging SNPs in 17q12-21 were genotyped, including polymorphisms in six genes (GSDMA, GSDMB, ORMDL3, IKZF3, ZPBP2 and TOP2). Data on pet ownership was collected using a validated questionnaire. Amongst asthmatic children, information on hospital admission due to severe asthma exacerbations was extracted from hospital notes. All asthma cases underwent spirometry. Results: There were significant interactions between 2 GSDMA SNPs (rs921651 and rs8077456) and current pet ownership in relation to asthma presence. For one of these SNPs (rs921651), there was also an interaction with pet ownership during the first year of life, in that A allele homozygotes had significantly lower risk for asthma if they kept pet in home, with no effect of early-life pet ownership among G allele carriers. Amongst children with asthma, three SNPs in ORMDL3 (rs3744246, rs4795403, rs4795404) significantly interacted with current pet ownership in relation to asthma severity (hospital admissions with asthma exacerbation). For example, carriers of the T allele of rs4795403 were at significantly higher risk of hospital admission with acute asthma exacerbation if they currently had a pet, with no effect of current pet ownership amongst C allele homozygotes. Amongst patients with asthma, we observed one significant interaction in relation to lung function (FEV 1 % predicted), in that T allele carriers in IKZF3 SNP rs9635726 had significantly better lung function if exposed to pets in early life, with no effect of pet ownership among C allele homozygotes. Conclusion: Polymorphisms in 17q12-21 region interact with pet exposure in relation to both asthma presence and asthma severity. Background: Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid and ligand for five G protein coupled receptors (S1P1-S1P5), is a key regulator of cell trafficking, cell differentiation and immune responses.

Method: HASM cells have been grown from bronchial biopsies of healthy individuals. Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays and real-time PCR have been used to determine gene expression. Intracellular signalling in response to S1P was measured using MAP kinase phosphorylation, intracellular calcium and cAMP assays. Results: A range of selective agonists/ antagonists has been verified in recombinant S1P receptor overexpression models and used together with knock down experiments to define receptor specific responses in HASM cells. Microarray data showed that S1P potently activated gene expression in HASM cells, regulating the expression of more than 100 genes, including transcription factors, cytokines and membrane receptors and several genes known to be involved in regulation of airway remodelling and airway hyperresponsiveness. This has been confirmed for a selection of genes at the mRNA and protein level. S1P induced changes in intracellular calcium and Erk phosphorylation were required for gene regulation. Three of the five known S1P receptors are expressed in HASM cells at mRNA level: S1P1, S1P2, and S1P3.

All data were required double entry by epi-info 3.5.3 software and processed by SPSS v19.0. Results: 14 085 questionnaires were distributed to parents, 13513 (95.9%) were completed. Totally 497 children were diagnosed with asthma (451 cases were diagnosed as typical asthma and 46 cases as cough variant asthma), and 33 children could not be made a definite diagnosis. Among the 497 children, 40.6% (202 cases) had not been diagnosed with asthma before. The overall prevalence of asthma among children aged 0-14 years old in Beijing urban area was 3.68%, and the prevalence of typical asthma and cough variant asthma was 3.34% and 0.34% respectively. The prevalence of asthma was twice as great in boys (4.80%) as in girls (2.40%). The prevalence of pre-schoolers was 5.05%, which was significantly higher than that of school-age children ( Background: Polymorphisms of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) genes have been implicated in susceptibility to asthma. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether there was any association between childhood asthma and polymorphisms of the PAI-1 and ACE genes. Method: Two hundred and three Turkish children aged 5-15 years, including 102 asthmatic patients and 101 healthy control subjects were included in this study. Asthma group was divided into two groups as follows: Group I: Asthmatic children with positive family history for atopy (n = 53), Group II: Asthmatic children without any family history for atopy (n = 49). One hundred and 28 atopic family members were also included in the study. The insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the ACE and PAI-1 4G/ 5G gene polymorphisms were carried out by polymerase chain reaction. Results: The prevalence of the PAI-1 4G allele was significantly greater in asthmatic children compared to control group (P < 0.05, OR: 1.64% 95 CI: 1.11-2.43) but there was not any significant relation between ACE I/D genotypes and childhood asthma. No significant difference was detected between Group I and II in terms of these ACE and PAI-1 genotypes and allele frequencies. No significant relationship was found between both gene polymorphisms and total serum IgE and skin prick test results. Conclusion: It has been established that PAI-1 4G allele may be a genetic risk factor childhood asthma but ACE gene I/D polymorphisms do not play a role in development of asthma in the sample of Turkish children. Background: Previous studies suggest the presence of different childhood wheeze phenotypes based on statistical modeling of parentally-reported wheezing. Objective: To investigate whether joint modeling of observations from both medical records and parental reports helps to more accurately define wheezing disorders during childhood, and better characterises severity. Method: In a population-based birth cohort (n = 1184), we analyzed data from two sources (parentally-reported current wheeze at four follow-ups and physicianconfirmed wheeze from medical records in each year from birth to age 8) to determine classes of children who differ in wheeze trajectories. We tested validity of these classes by examining their relations with objective outcomes (lung function, airway hyper-reactivity, atopy), asthma medication and severe exacerbations. Results: Longitudinal latent-class modeling identified a five-class model that best described the data. We assigned classes as: No wheezing (NW, 53.3%); Transientearly wheeze (TEW, 13.7%); Late-onset wheeze (LOW, 16.7%); Persistent-controlled wheeze (PCW, 13.1%); Persistenttroublesome wheeze (PTW, 3.2%). Longitudinal trajectories of atopy and lung function differed significantly between classes. PTW had diminished lung function and more hyper-reactive airways compared to all other classes. We observed striking differences in exacerbations, hospitalisations and unscheduled visits, all of which were higher in PTW compared to other classes (e.g. risk of exacerbation was much higher in PTW compared to PCW [OR 3.58, 95% CI 1.27-10.09], LOW [15.92, ).

Method: In the ongoing 16-year old follow up in the birth cohort BAMSE, questionnaires were sent out to the adolescents and their parents. The adolescents were asked about how many hours the last 12 months they watched TV, played computer/video games or read per day and how many hours they did physical activities during a typical week. Parents were asked about symptoms of asthma. Asthma was defined as at least two of the following three criteria; symptoms of wheeze in the last 12 months, ever doctors diagnosis of asthma, or been using asthma medicine occasionally or regularly the last 12 months.

Obese asthmatics had a similar functional data than non-obese, but worse asthma control and quality of life index, as well as a trend to have lower sputum eosinophilia (Table) , with no-difference in asthma treatment. Asthmatics with NP showed similar asthma control and quality of life index than asthmatics without NP, but worse spirometry and higher sputum eosinophilia (Table) . Asthmatics with NP had the same level of therapy than others, but a higher use of intranasal corticosteroids (95.7% vs 65.9%, P = 0.005). In a multivariate analysis taking into account age, sex, FEV1 (% of predicted), obesity, NP and sputum eosinophilia, only the obesity predicted the lack of asthma control (OR: 5.6, CI: 1.4-22.8, P = 0.01). Conclusion: In patients with severe asthma, NP is associated with increased eosinophilic airway inflammation and with worse lung function, but it has less impact on asthma control and quality of life than obesity. Background: Through the National Health Survey (ENSANUT 2006) we know that one of every four teenagers are overweight or obese and that 9-12% of them have asthma. The association between obesity and asthma has been already studied, demonstrating the presence of low-grade chronic inflammation and increased oxidative stress as well as an imbalance of adipokines, decreased adiponectin and increased leptin. Method: Cross-sectional study that included adolescents 11-16 years, both gender, obese and eutrophic classified based on their body mass index (BMI) as eutrophic (BMI PC 5-84) and obese (BMI PC >95) with and without asthma (mild intermittent asthma, GINA 2006). After the signature of assent and consent underwent medical history, anthropometry parameters, spirometry and blood samples for triglycerids, cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, glucose, insulin, adiponectin, leptin and oxidative stress parameters (malondialdehyde, glutathione peroxidase and paraoxanasa-1). Results: We recruited 260 patients with a mean age of 12.23 (1.72 + DE) classified into four groups: eutrophic nonasthmatic (ENA) 89 (34.2%), b) eutrophic asthmatic (EA) 71 (27.3%) of these 56.20% where male and 43.7% female; c) nonasthmatic obese (NAO) 56 (21.5%) and obese asthmatic (OA) 44 (16.9%) of these 58% where male and 42% female. The correlation between the ratio of weight, BMI and anthropometric and metabolic parameters obtained, specifically triglycerides, HDLcholesterol and VLDL-cholesterol were statistically significant when comparing ENA and EA vs NAO and OA (P < 0.05 ANO-VA). Regarding adipokines, we only found a statistically significant difference when comparing leptin among the four groups, as the analysis of the values obtained in oxidative stress tests were not considered statistically significant (P = 0.05 ANOVA). Conclusion: We found no correlation between adiponectin with oxidative stress parameters. The leptin concentration in OA was inversely proportional to the malonaldehyde. All obese studied had hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL-cholesterol, and leptin increased compared with normal weight adolescents. Background: The purpose of this study is to identify the frequency of wheezing cases and the associated risk factors in infants during first year of life in Adana. Method: Physical examination records within the first day after birth as well as the family demographics and history information through surveys were collected for all infants born in 2010. Physical examinations of all infants were made during their visits after 3rd, 6th and 12th months. Information on nutrition levels, infection history and changes in home conditions were also recorded in each of these visits. Moreover, skin test was applied on all infants after 6 and 12 months, in which blood samples were taken to measure food specific IgE concentrations. In order to clarify the etiology in infants with recurrent wheeze, complete blood count was taken, peripheric blood smear examination was made to check eosinophil and serum immunoglobulin levels, sweat test was conducted and when necessary thorax CT scan was analyzed. Wheezing phenotype was determined based on European Respiratory Society's report Results: A total of 1377 infants were included in the study. Within the follow-up period of 1 year, wheezing was observed in 16% (n = 220) of cases. Among these cases, 94% (n = 206) were viral induced (episodic), 6% (n = 14) were multiple trigger wheezing and 17% (n = 37) were recurrent. We observed that the risk of wheezing and viral induced wheezing is higher in patients with a history of lower and upper respiratory tract infections. Recurrent wheezing was found to be more prevalent among infants living in large households. A statistically significant relationship (P < 0.05) was observed between multiple trigger wheezing and variables such as the period of breastfeeding, presence of atopy history in the family, maternal smooking, birth season and presence of atopic dermatitis. Term birth, pet breeding, and having birth in summer and winter seasons were among the protective factors that reduce the risk of wheezing. Conclusion: Our study is significant for being the first study in Turkey on prevalence of wheezing in this age group. Monitoring of the infants included in this study is still continuing.

Background: In the Allergy Service patients from different parts of the world are attended. These patients greatly differ with respect to the environmental conditions to which each have been exposed throughout their life. To study the environmental influence of the Madrid area, the allergy profile of patients who were born and live most of their lives in this city was characterised. Method: A retrospective, descriptive, study of patients aged more than 15 years born in Madrid, first seen in the Allergy clinic of H.G.U Gregrorio Mara\u00f1 on in 2008 or 2009. Age, sex, final diagnosis and main allergens causing pathology were analized. Of the 4048 new patients seen at the clinic, 2102 (51.24%) were born in Madrid, of these, a random sample of 258 patients were selected for the study. Results: Patients had a mean age of 39.2 years, (SD 17.46), 64.3% were women. 220 (85.3%) patients completed the study. Final diagnosis was rhinoconjunctivitis and/or asthma in 116 (52.7%), food allergy in 32 (14.5%), urticaria and/ or angioedema in 22 (10%), anaphylaxis in 10 (4.5%), drug allergy in 48 (21.8%), sensitisation to Anisakis simplex in 20 (9.1%), and other diagnoses in 14 (6.3%). Allergy disease was discarded in 33 patients (15%). Rinoconjuntivitis and/or asthma were allergic in 88.8%. The most common allergens involved were: pollen (73.01%), mainly grass (67.46%), trees (46.8%) and weeds (46.8%). 43.7% were sensitised to pets, 23.8% to mites, and 9.5% to molds.

Method: We screened our database of 205 patients with severe asthma who presented to the Respiratory or Asthma Clinics at Singapore General Hospital between January 2011 and June 2012. Severe asthma was defined according to the World Health Organization classification of 'treatmentresistant severe asthma' (Bousquet et al., 2010) , that is, patients who require a combination of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta agonists. 135 patients with treatment-resistant severe asthma who presented to our asthma clinic were divided into three groups according to postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1): no fixed obstruction (FEV1 \u2265 80% predicted, n = 83), moderate fixed obstruction (50 \u2264 FEV1 < 80% predicted, n = 41) and severe fixed obstruction (FEV1 < 50% predicted, n = 11). We compared clinical and demographic parameters between groups. Results: Patients with severe fixed obstruction were significantly more likely to be male and current or ex-smokers than the other groups. Overall, there was a significant negative correlation between postbronchodilator FEV1 with pack-year smoking history, and a significant positive correlation between postbronchodilator FEV1 with prebronchodilator FEV1/FVC and prebronchodilator FVC. Additionally, the severe fixed obstruction group had significantly lower prevalence of allergic rhinitis. Multiple linear regression revealed that male sex, pack-year smoking history, prebronchodilator FEV1/FVC and prebronchodilator FVC were independent factors for fixed airways obstruction. Conclusion: Smoking is associated with fixed airways obstruction in severe asthma and manifests as air trapping. Our findings underscore the importance of smoking cessation in asthma patients to mitigate the development of irreversible airways obstruction. Background: From January 1989 to February 1990 a birth cohort (n = 1456) was recruited on the Isle of Wight, UK, to prospectively study the natural history of asthma and allergies. Information was collected at birth on the family history of their parents (1st generation). The cohort (2nd generation) has undergone follow-up at 1, 2, 4, 10 and 18 years of age, with follow up rate between 83 and 90%, and has been extensively phenotyped. The cohort is now producing children of their own, giving a unique opportunity to study a 3rd generation. We wish to identify, antenatally, all babies born to the birth cohort and follow them for the first year of life to investigate transgenerational epigenetic mechanisms and its relevance to the development of asthma and allergy. Methods: For recruitment of the 3rd generation, the cohort was sent patient information sheets and a letter asking them to make contact if they were expecting or planning to have a baby. The Isle of Wight has one hospital where the research nurses identify the women from the clinic lists. Pregnant women are given scans at 12 and 20 weeks giving the opportunity to identify cohort women. Once consented, pregnant women provide blood samples at 12 and 28 weeks and cord blood and placenta samples are collected at birth. They also complete questionnaires and undergo skin prick and lung function testing. Wherever possible the non-cohort parent is invited to participate. After birth, follow-up is at 3, 6 and 12 months. Questionnaires are completed, samples of house dust, babies' stools, saliva and nasal secretions collected. Results: An average of 90 pregnancies/ month are screened, and approximately four are eligible for the 3rd Generation study. To date, 117 have been identified, five refused participation, three dropped out and the remaining 109 are currently in the study. Identifying male members of the cohort who are fathers is difficult. A high percentage of pregnancies early in the study were unplanned, with the mothers often living in less than ideal situations. Despite this, we are achieving good compliance by tailoring our approach to individual circumstances. Conclusion: This highlights the importance/problems of keeping track of young adults (with changing addresses and contact numbers); recruiting and keeping them in the follow on study with their children as the participants.

Aim: To explore the association between dietary patterns and asthma prevalence in a nationally representative population. Methods: A representative sample from the IV Portuguese National Health Survey was analyzed. Following asthma definitions were used: ever asthma (ever medical doctor asthma diagnosis), current asthma (asthma within previous 12 months), current persistent asthma (asthma drugs within previous 12 months), current severe asthma (emergency because of asthma within previous 12 months), and incident asthma (diagnosis within previous 12 months). Dietary patterns (DP) were identified by Latent Trait Models (LTM), using MPlus v5.2., based on dietary intake food items at meals and snacks. Age, gender, BMI, education, family income, proxy reporting information and smoking were analyzed as confounders. Unconditional logistic regression models were performed to analyze whether DP were associated with asthma prevalence. Results: Final analysis included 32644 adults (\u226520 years-old), 53% female. Prevalence of ever asthma was 5.3%, current asthma 3.5%, current persistent asthma 3.0%, current severe asthma 1.4%, and incident asthma 0.2%.

Frequency distribution in relation with asthma severity (the IRIS-ASMA study) Background: Many studies have documented the high association between upper (rhinitis, rhinosinusitis) and lower (asthma, COPD, bronchiectasis) airway diseases. However, the prevalence and severity of rhinitis and/or chronic rhinosinusitis related to asthma severity has not been deeply studied. The aim of the IRIS-ASMA study was to assess the frequencies of nasal and sinusal diseases in a cohort of asthmatic patients, stratified by severity. Methods: Asthmatic patients (N = 492), mean age 45 (15) year, female 70.5%, were recruited according to GINA asthma severity classification (intermittent 17.3%; persistent 82.7% [mild 24.6%, moderate 31.4%, severe 26.7%]) in a prospective study carried out in 2010-2011 by pneumonologists and ENT specialists of 23 centers from Spain (19) and Latin America (4).

Conclusion: SCIT points to be a major form of allergen-specific immunotherapy in the treatment of IgE-mediated allergy has become a widely accepted routine treatment for allergy. High satisfaction between the patients with the treatment. The information provided with the present study may lead to better appreciation of the potential of SCIT and may foster the design of a large-scale, multicenter studies for its appraisal. Background: Pollen allergy is the most prevelant IgE-mediated allergy type with 86% of allergic patients in Germany reporting pollen-related allergic symptoms (B\u20ac ocking C et al., Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz 2012) . SIT is the only causal treatment option for IgE-mediated allergies, but nevertheless, <20% of the allergic patients in Germany receive SIT (Chivato T et al., JACI 2012) . In Germany, subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) is most often used (75% of therapies acc. to IMS NPA (German market) November 2012). Up to date more than 1 million people received SCIT with high-dose hypoallergenic pollen preparations from Allergopharma. But what is the profile of a typical patient in daily practice? Method: Demographic data of patients included in two post-marketing surveillance studies with high-dose hypoallergenic pollen preparations were evaluated. Data included sex, age, sensitisation profile, severity and duration of symptoms, medication use, and patients' rating of their condition on a 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS) during the preceding pollen season. Results: Data of 4981 patients were evaluated (55% female, 45% male). Patients were aged 4-79, with a median of 30. More than half of the patients were sensitised to only one allergen group. Most patients were sensitised to grass pollen (68%), followed by tree pollen (61%) and weeds (21%). 96% of patients suffered from allergic rhinitis, 84% from conjunctivitis and 32% from asthma. The median duration of disease ranged from 3 (asthma) to 4 years (rhinitis, conjunctivitis). About one half of the patients rated their rhinitis and conjunctivitis symptoms as of moderate severity. Intake of anti-symptomatic medication was as follows: 81% of patients took antihistamines, 41% corticosteroids, 19% beta-2-agonists and 31% mast-cell stabilisers. Patients rated their condition during the preceding pollen season between 1 (very good) and 10 (very bad) points with a median of seven on the VAS. 84% of patients reported six points and worse. Conclusion: The typical patient receiving high-dose hypoallergenic pollen SCIT in the daily practice in Germany is around 30 years old, sensitised to only one allergen group, suffers since 4 years from allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis, needs antihistamines and rates his condition with 7/10 points of a visual rating scale.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 846, "end": 934, "text": "(B\u20ac ocking C et al., Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz 2012)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1072, "end": 1105, "text": "SIT (Chivato T et al., JACI 2012)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1524"}, {"text": "Cluster immunotherapy can be safely initiated extra and intra-seasonally for grass pollen allergic patients Werner, G Medical Practice, Pneumology, Kevelaer, Germany Background: Subcutaneous specific immunotherapy (SCIT) as a causal treatment is usually started outside of the pollen season. For this presentation patients' data were retrospectively analysed to assess the compliance of grass pollen allergic patients as well as the safety of SCIT with highly polymerized extracts of grass pollen initiated before, after and during the grass pollen season (May, June, July). Method: 84 grass pollen allergic patients (18-63 years; 39 female; 45 male) were included for retrospective analysis. The patients were treated with a highly polymerized allergen extract from grass pollen (CLUSTOID; 10 000 TU/ml) according to the cluster schedule starting with two injections on the first treatment day (0.2 ml + 0.5 ml; interval 15 min) and following maintenance injections of 0.5 ml every 4 weeks. The compliance has been assessed on a five-point rating scale from very bad to very good and any docu-mented reactions to the injections were graded as local or systemic side effect according to EAACI position paper (1993), described by Pfaar et al. (Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol 2009) . Results: Overall, the compliance was identified as 'very good' for 57.1%, as 'good' for 40.5% and as 'satisfactory' for 2.4% of the patients. After 94.7% of all injections (n = 409) no reactions have been noted. Local reactions were documented after 5.1% of all injections: 1.9% at intra-seasonally initiation, 3.2% for initiation outside of the pollen season. 4.9% of all injections were of grade 0 and 0.2% of grade 1 (outside the pollen season). One injection (0.2%) resulted in a systemic grade 1-reaction (extra-seasonally). No severe side effects were observed. Conclusion: The initiation of cluster treatment with a highly polymerized allergen extract of grass pollen outside but also during the pollen season has been shown to be a safe treatment for grass pollen allergic patients and displayed a good compliance. Background: Since the tongue is highly vascularized, there is a theoretical risk of passage into the bloodstream of proteins contained in allergen extracts, especially allergens, during sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT). In the present study, we evaluated such a risk by using western blotting and mass spectrometry approaches. Method: Mice and/or dogs were administered sublingually with a ragweed pollen extract or the recombinant major birch pollen allergen, rBet v 1. Blood was collected at different timepoints and the presence of ragweed pollen allergens and proteins was monitored by western blotting using polyclonal antibodies raised against, respectively, ragweed Amb a 1 and ragweed pollen proteins. Mass spectrometry (MS) was used to detect rBet v 1 specific peptides within blood samples. Results: As a control, Amb a 1 and proteins from a ragweed pollen extract administered intravenously to mice and dogs were detected in blood until 1 h after administration. In contrast, sera from mice and dogs collected from 0 to 1 h did not exhibit any reactivity in western blot revealed with polyclonal antibodies to Amb a 1 or to ragweed pollen proteins.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1242, "end": 1274, "text": "(Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol 2009)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1527"}, {"text": "Sera from dogs administered sublingually with rBet v 1 did not exhibit either any rBet v 1 specific peptide. Conclusion: No passage into the bloodstream of proteins, especially of allergens, was observed during sublingual administration in mice and dogs of an allergen extract or a recombinant allergen. This illustrates why SLIT is associated with a very limited risk of systemic adverse events that would be due to a massive activation by intact allergens of inflammatory cells such as basophils. This further documents the superior safety profile of SLIT, when compared to SCIT. Background: To evaluate the pre-and post-1-year clinical and immunologic effects of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) and to assess predictive parameters on response to SLIT in patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) to house-dust mites (HDM; Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides farinae) in Korea. Method: Between November 2009 and January 2011, 69 patients suffering from AR symptoms and sensitised to HDM on skin prick tests were enrolled in this study and started once-daily SLIT without escalation therapy. Each patient was followed with diary card of symptom and rescue medication use. Pre-& post-1 year total IgE, immune specific IgE, immune specific IgG4, eosinophil counts, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) were evaluated using ImmunoCAP. Effective and less effective response group were classified depending on whether they had a reduction of symptom up to 30% compared to their baseline. Results: All of the allergic symptoms were significantly improved with reduced rescue medication score (P < 0.001). There were significant decrements in peripheral blood eosinophil counts, ECP after 1-year SLIT (P < 0.001). Specific IgE and IgG4 for HDM increased after 1 year. Effective response group had a tendency to have lower immune specific IgE/IgG4 level for Dermatophagoides farinae after 1-year SLIT than less effective response group (P = 0.028). Conclusion: SLIT improved the symptoms and medication scores in AR patients sensitised to HDM and modified laboratory parameters, such as total and specific IgE and IgG4 for HDM, eosinophil counts and ECP after 1 year. A low specific IgE/IgG4 for Dermatophagoides farinae after 1-year SLIT may be a useful parameter to predict the effectiveness of long-term SLIT. Background: Allergen specific immunotherapy has option not only to change the natural course of allergic rhinitis, but to improve the quality of life. Satisfaction of treatment is of great importance for the compliance. The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate the efficiency of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) on quality of life (QOL) and satisfaction in patients with moderate/severe allergic rhinitis, sensitised to pollens. Method: In this real life study 37 patients (men -22; mean age -21.8) with moderate/severe allergic rhinitis, sensitised to pollens were included. QOL at baseline and after one season of SLIT was established by Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ \u00e2 ). The patients' satisfaction was evaluated by using visual analog scale (VAS).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1527"}, {"text": "The mean values of all the QOL items improved significantly (P < 0.01) with the following reductions: activities -3.65 to 1.61; sleep -1.97 to 0.80; general problems -1.61 to 0.80; practical problems -3.39 to 1.26; nasal symptoms -3.58 to 1.45; eye symptoms -3.45 to 1.29; emotions -2.43 to 1.02. The patients' satisfaction was increased significantly (P < 0.01) -36.9 mm to 73.2 mm. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates significant improvement in quality of life and great satisfaction after one season of sublingual immunotherapy of moderate/severe allergic rhinitis in patients, sensitised to pollens. Background: Among the several regimens of immunotherapy (IT), those pre-co sea-sonal seem to obtain more and more consent, even for the major demonstrated compliance. Nevertheless it is not clear yet, how long it is possible to delay the beginning of the pre seasonal phase to obtain anyway effectiveness against the allergic grass pollen rhinitis. The perlingual immunotherapy (PLIT) is a recent alternative to the most known sublingual IT. In this study, we observed if, starting the PLIT late, you get also a significant reduction of symptoms in grass pollen rhinitis. Methods: It has been administered PLIT against grass pollen with a pre-co seasonal regimen to 25 children (16 males and 9 females) between 5 and 18 years old with grass pollen rhinitis, 4 of them with grass pollen asthma. The PLIT starts from March/April. The clinical symptoms (0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild symptoms, 2 = moderate symptoms, 3 = severe symptoms) and rescue therapy were recorded in a daily diary. It has been created a single effectiveness parameter (SEP) inclusive of the severity of the symptoms as well as of the rescue therapy. At the end of each year was made a meeting with patients and parents together to estimate the outcome of PLIT. Our observation was conducted for two consecutive pollen seasons Results: All the children have completed the study. Both the single score of general symptoms, nasal symptoms, pulmonary symptoms, rescue therapy and the SEP, related to total symptoms and the rescue therapy, have demonstrated a significant reduction of 41% (P < 0.01) compared to the one obtained in the previous year of the treatment's beginning. Conclusions: This study, confirming a good compliance to PLIT, refers to a significant effective reduction of symptoms even though the IT started late compared to the recommended pre-co seasonal regimens. Background: The Previsora Allergy Service, Camag\u20ac uey has studied sensitisation to the following allergens: Ambros \u0131a psilostachya, Amaranthus leucocarpus, Helianthus annuus, Rumex acetosella, Lolium perenne, Cupressus lindley, and Cocos nucifera. Forty percent of individuals with rhinitis and / or asthma were sensitised to these allergens. Objective: Specify the efficacy and safety of monotherapy in patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis sensitised to pollen allergens. Methods: There were 210 patients whose Prick Test was positive to pollens; monotherapy was indicated in those who expressed the largest wheal diameter in the skin test. Immunotherapy (IT) was begun by the fourth decimal dilution of 10 000 protein nitrogen units (10 PNU / cc). A weekly dosage increment regimen was initiated. Efficacy and safety were actively monitored for 15 months. Efficacy variables included reducing the frequency and severity of symptoms, drug consumption behavior, and the quality of life questionnaires (RQLQ and AQLQ). Safety was assessed by local allergic reactions (rash, itching, and wheals), systemic allergic reactions were classified by grades (I, II, III, and IV). Results: There were nine patients who initiated then left IT. The reduction in frequency and severity of the crisis was 41% compared to baseline. The use of medications was reduced by 64%. The quality of life was increased by 3 points in asthma and 2 points in allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. There were 16 (7.6%) local allergic reactions and 5 (2.3%) grade I systemic allergic reactions.

Polyallergic patients benefited as much from AIT as monoallergic patients. Background: Allergen specific immunotherapy (AIT) is the only treatment able to act on the causes and not merely on the symptoms of allergy. AIT may be administered mainly in two forms, subcutaneous (SCIT) and sublingual (SLIT). Several trials have highlighted the efficacy and safety of both forms in allergic rhinitis and asthma. Method: There are many clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic data that must be monitored in patients during AIT therapy; for this purpose, we created a database that allows to input the patients' clinical, laboratory and personal data, and to easily manage a large number of data. The database has been realised through Microsoft Access.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1534"}, {"text": "Results: A numeric ID is assigned to each patient, and for each patient there are different cards corresponding to the number of blood samples done. Each card is composed of the following slots: blood samples data, diagnosis, clinical data (rhinitis, conjunctivitis, asthma, hives, itch, dermatitis), drugs, skin prick tests, IgE, IgG and IgG4 levels, basophil activation tests. Clinical data are expressed by a value between 0 and 3, corresponding to the severity of symptoms: absent, slight, moderate, severe. Spirometric data are also collected in asthmatic patients: FEV1%, FVC% and FEF %. Therapy is constituted by a list of the most commonly used drugs, each of these expressed by a numerical score between 0 and 5, in relation to the frequency of use: never, rarely, often, almost daily, continuously at the lowest dose, continuously at the highest dose. IgE slot consists of specific entries, varying according to the different respiratory allergens to which AIT is directed. At last, also IgG and IgG4 values and basophil activation test slots entries are specific according to the different allergens. Conclusion: This database allows a close monitoring of a large number of data. It is possible to quickly evaluate the patient clinical evolution, to study possible symptoms improvements, as well as the decrease in the use of drugs and of rescue drugs. It also allows monitoring the evolution in IgG and IgG4 levels, whose performance during AIT has not been completely understood yet. Background: Specific immunotherapy is widespread used in treatment of allergic disease. Route of application of allergen is crucial for therapeutic efficacy. Subcutaneous route (SCIT) is well documented for success, and other routes improved their efficacy. The other very important challenge is use of only one or multiples allergens in same preparation. Here we analyzed single or multiple allergen use in same time, but separated injected in treatment of SCIT immunotherapy. Method: Patient treated with SCIT at least two years was included in the study. Total and specific IgE was measured using enzimimmunoessay (ELISA). IgE were measured before SCIT and after one of treatment, Data were analyzed with Mann Whitney test of multiple correlation. Statistical analysis was performed with statistical package Statistica for Windows. Results: We analyzed 32 patients, 19 female and 13 male. Among all 17 were asthmatics, 6 with allergic rhinitis and 9 with eczema. Mean age was 33.29 years (SD 19). Mean total IgE concentration before SCIT was 648 IU/ml (SD 1287), and after one year mean total IgE was 512 IU/(ml (SD 884). Decrease of total IgE level was statistical significant at level P < 0.05. Specific IgE were measured for ragweed, tress, grass, home dust and fungi. Ten patients were treated with only one allergen, 12 with two, and 4 with three or four allergen. For all patients specific IgE was measured. No differences of results were noted if one or more allergen were given for SCIT. Improvement of clinical outcome according to used questionnaire was the same in any group. Conclusion: Clinical outcome of SCIT was the same in patients with only one allergen or more allergen, if they were injected separately. Background: Sublingual immunotherapy is currently accepted as a suitable alternative to subcutaneous immunotherapy because of its easy and painless administration and improved safety. Many clinical trials have demonstrated that sublingual immunotherapy is an effective and safe treatment for pollen or mite allergic rhinitis. However, there have been very few studies overall on children with allergic rhinitis who are sensitised to house-dust mites in Asia. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of sublingual immunotherapy in children with allergic rhinitis to house-dust mites. Methods: A total of 112 patients under the age of 15 who had allergic rhinitis to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides farinae were included. All patients were treated with sublingual immunotherapy (Staloral \u00e2 ). Symptom scores and quality of life were evaluated by questionnaires until one year after sublingual immunotherapy. The medication score was assessed monthly using a diary medication card and serologic tests were evaluated before and 6 and 12 months after treatment. Adverse effects and compliance were also investigated. Results: All nasal and non-nasal symptoms and quality of life were significantly improved after treatment. The total medication score was decreased significantly after sublingual immunotherapy. There was no significant change in serologic tests. Some minor adverse effects were reported, however there were no systemic reactions. The drop-out rate was 21%. Conclusions: Sublingual immunotherapy is a valuable therapy for the treatment of allergic rhinitis in Asian children sensitised to house-dust mites. Background: Subcutaneus (SCIT) and sublingual (SLIT) immunotherapy are the two most prescribed ruotes for administering allergen specific immunotherapy (ASI). They were shown to be effective in control of symptoms and in reducing rescue medication use in patients with allergic disease, but their effectiviness has to be balanced against side-effects. In recent years, SLIT has been increasingly prescribed, instead of SCIT, because of improved safety and easy administration. To assess which route is the most effective in the treatment of patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis to grass pollen. Method: An indirect meta-analysis-based comparison between SCIT and SLIT was performed. Treatment efficacy was determined as the standardised mean difference (SMD) in symptom and medication scores obtained with active treatment, SCIT or SLIT, compared to placebo. Studies were included if they were duoble-blind randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing SCIT or SLIT to placebo. Thirty-six RCTs (3014 patients, 2768 controls) were analyzed. Results: The overall effecy size of SCIT for symptom score (SMD, \u00c00.92; 95%CI, \u00c01.26 to 0.58) was significantly higher than SLIT, both administered via drops (SMD, \u00c00.25; 95%CI, \u00c00.45 to \u00c00.05) and tablets (SMD, \u00c00.40; 95% CI, \u00c00.54 to \u00c00.27). Similar resuls were reported for medication score (SCIT: SMD, \u00c00.58; 95% CI, \u00c00.86 to \u00c00.30. SLIT drops: SMD, \u00c00.37; 95% CI \u00c00.74 to \u00c00.00 SLIT tablets SMD, \u00c00.30; 95% CI, \u00c00.44 to \u00c00.16). Conclusion: Our results provide indirect but solid evidence that SCIT is more effective than SLIT in cotrolling symptoms and reducing the use of anti-allergic medications in seasonal allergic rhinoconjuntivitis to grass pollen.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1534"}, {"text": "Clinical studies in allergen-specific immunotherapy III 1540 Grass allergen immunotherapy tablets vs symptomatic treatment for allergic rhinoconjunctivitisa health economic evaluation Vestergaard, AS 1 ; Andreasen, JN 2 1 Aalborg University, Danish Center for Healthcare Improvements, Aalborg, Denmark; 2 ALK, H\u00f8rsholm, Denmark Background: Previous health economic analyses for specific immunotherapy (SIT) have been based on short term clinical data or retrospective database searches. The purpose of this analysis is to assess the cost-effectiveness of the grass allergy immunotherapy tablet (AIT), GRAZAX \u00e2 (Phleum pratense 75 000 SQ-T / 2800 BAU, ALK, Denmark) GRAZAX \u00e2 compared to symptomatic treatment, using primarily evidence based data from a large long-term clinical trial. In that study, sustained effect in post-treatment years was demonstrated. Method: A health economic evaluation was performed based on a Markov model with a 10-year time horizon. A Danish societal view was adopted. The outcome was identified as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Information on resource consumption and the outcome was retrieved from trial data and the published peerreviewed literature. Sensitivity analyses were performed to identify parameters of critical importance for the result. Results: The incremental cost-utility ratio amounted to \u20ac 21 271.01 per QALY for GRAZAX \u00e2 compared to symptomatic treatment. The cost-utility ratio is therefore below the commonly accepted willingnessto-pay threshold of \u00a3 20 000 (\u20ac 25 000), stated by the UK's National Institute for Health and Clinical and Excellence. The sensitivity analysis identified the critical parameters to be the applied time horizon, inclusion of indirect costs, and risk of developing asthma. Conclusion: This health economic evaluation demonstrates that GRAZAX \u00e2 in combination with symptomatic medication provides a cost-effective treatment option within a commonly accepted willingnessto-pay threshold. Background: Efficacy of 300IR 5-grass pollen extract sublingual tablet has been demonstrated in short-term and long-term studies. Here we report the results of three single-season, natural field studies using the daily Combined Score (CS), a measure which equally weights symptom scores and rescue medication use. The use of this score is consistent with the World Allergy Organization's recommendation that a combined symptom and rescue medication score, especially one with equivalent importance of the two components, be utilised as the primary outcome measure of clinical trials with allergen specific immunotherapy for respiratory allergy. Method: In three short-term studies (2 in adults, 1 in children and adolescents), participants with grass pollen associated-allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC) were randomised to placebo or 300IR 5-grass pollen extract sublingual tablet starting 4 months (4M) prior to the pollen season and continuing for its duration. Participants scored each of their 6 rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms on a 0-3 scale [rhinoconjunctivitis total symptom score (RTSS, scale 0-18)] and reported rescue medication use (RMS, scale 0-3). The daily CS [(RTSS/6 + RMS)/2] was evaluated using a repeated measures ANCOVA model. Results: In the two adult studies, 284 (placebo = 148; 300IR 4M = 136) and 436 (placebo = 228; 300IR 4M = 210) participants comprised the full analysis sets (FAS). In the pediatric study, 266 children and adolescents (placebo = 135; 300IR 4M = 131) were in the FAS. Significant differences in daily CS between the 300IR 4M group and placebo were shown in each of the studies (P \u2264 0.0005). Over the pollen period, the daily CS least-squares (LS) mean differences between the 300IR 4M and placebo groups were \u00c00.13 [95% CI (\u00c00.19; \u00c00.06)], and \u00c00.21 [95% CI (\u00c00.30; \u00c00.11)] in the adult studies, respectively and \u00c00.19 [95% CI (\u00c00.29; \u00c00.08)] in the pediatric study, corresponding to relative differences of \u00c028.2%, \u00c029.6%, and \u00c030.1%, respectively. Conclusion: In analyses using the state of the art measure, daily Combined Score, the efficacy of 5-grass pollen extract sublingual tablet administered according to a 4-month pre-seasonal and co-seasonal regimen was observed in patients with grass polleninduced allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. Background: The efficacy of the 300IR dose of 5-grass pollen extract sublingual tablet administered according to a 4-month pre-seasonal and co-seasonal regimen has been consistently demonstrated in 4 DBPC natural field studies of patients with grass pollen-associated allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. Here, we present results of a pooled efficacy analysis by sensitisation status (mono-sensitised vs poly-sensitised). Method: Adults, adolescents, and children (>5 years of age) underwent skin prick testing to a panel of seasonal and perennial aeroallergens prior to randomisation. Sensitisation status was derived from these results. Those with a positive test to 5grass pollen alone were considered monosensitised and those with a positive test to 5-grass pollen and at least one other allergen were deemed poly-sensitised. Participants self-scored each of their rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms (sneezing, rhinorrhoea, nasal pruritus, nasal congestion, ocular pruritus, watery eyes) on a 0-3 scale (from absent to severe) for a rhinoconjunctivitis total symptom score (RTSS) of 0-18. They also recorded their daily use of rescue medication (RMS, scale 0-3, according to the type of medication used). The daily Combined Score (daily CS, scale 0-3), which equally weights symptom and rescue medication scores [daily CS = (RTSS/6 + RMS)/2] was analysed using a linear mixed model with repeated measures for the single or first pollen period of the four studies. Results: Of 1381 participants, 490 (35.5%) were mono-sensitised (placebo = 252, 300IR 4M = 238) and 891 (64.5%) were poly-sensitised (placebo = 464, 300IR 4M = 427). Significant differences in daily CS between the 300IR 4M group and the placebo group were observed in both mono-and poly-sensitised subsets of patients (P < 0.0001). The daily CS relative LS mean difference vs placebo was \u00c024.8% [95% CI (\u00c036.0%; \u00c013.6%)] in mono-sensitised patients and \u00c029.8% [95% CI (\u00c039.3%; \u00c020.4%)] in poly-sensitised patients. Conclusion: Treatment with 300IR 5-grass pollen extract sublingual tablet was similarly effective in mono-sensitised and polysensitised patients. Background: Respiratory allergy due to parietaria pollen is particularly relevant in Mediterranean areas. A one year multicenter double blind placebo controlled randomised study was conducted in 2009-2010 to document the safety and efficacy of a vaccine with carbamylated monomeric allergoid of parietaria for sublingual administration in two different treatment regimens (coseasonal and precoseasonal). Method: Patients who concluded the previous study were openly followed-up for an additional season to assess their destiny in real life conditions. The eight centers involved were asked to directly contact patients and to fill-in a data form investigating whether they continued (with a standard pre-coseasonal regimen) or discontinued the treatment, how they judged retrospectively their allergic condition by means of visual analogue scale (VAS score 0-100) during 2009-2011. Averages VAS changes were calculated on the basis of immunotherapy continuation (shift to active treatment) or discontinuation in 2011 and with stratification depending on the kind of initial treatment. Results: At the end of 2011 parietaria peak pollen season, data on 90 out of 151 patients (60%) were available from 7 centers. From 2009 to 2010 in all the three arms a VAS improvement was evident (placebo +9; coseasonal +27; precoseasonal +28), but higher for the active treatments, not substantially different between them. From 2010 to 2011 the VAS further improved only in patients actively treated (+17), including those previously treated with placebo. Conversely patients who discontinued, in 2011 maintained the same VAS levels reached at the end of the study, excluding those who had received placebo that deteriorated. Stratified on the basis of the initial treatment, in 2011 patients previously randomised to placebo improved (+23) only if they shifted to active treatment, patients randomised to coseasonal or precoseasonal further improved (+8 and + 9, respectively) only if proceeded, or maintained the level of 2010 if interrupted. Background: Monosensitised children are still considered as ideal candidates for SLIT and they are included in the most part of the studies to assess its beneficial effects. In this regard its use in polysensitised patients is still a matter of debate, even though polysensitisation is reported as the most prevalent condition among allergic children. Method: We selected 70 children, 43 boys (61.4%), aged between 6 and 14 years (mean age 10 years) with a clinical history of allergic asthma and/or rhinitis nasal. Sensitisations were assessed by skin prick test, S-IgE and by the demonstration of a clear relationship between allergens exposure and symptoms. Within the 70 children group, 29 (41.4%) underwent SLIT for house dust mite (HDM) and 41 (58.6%) for Grass mix. During the 3 years of treatment, clinical symptoms were evaluated by a Nasal and Bronchial Symptom score: a score of 1 was assigned to mild symptoms, 2 to moderate and 3 to severe. Drug consumption was assessed by a Medication Score (MS): a score of 1 was assigned to the use of CST and BLD, 2 to ANTILT, and 0 if no medication was needed. Results: At the baseline 41 children (58.6%) were polysensitised to both HDM and to Grass mix while 29 children were monosensitised: 16 to HDM (22.9%), 13 to Grass Mix (18.6%). At T0, among monosensitised children, 6 (20.7%) were affected by rhinitis, 7 (24.1%) by asthma and 16 by rhinitis and asthma. Concerning polysensitised patients: 14 (34.1%) had rhinitis, 3 (7.3%) asthma and 24 (58.5%) asthma and rhinitis. In all 70 patients receiving SLIT, a significant clinical improvement was observed since the first year of treatment, irrespective of the allergen, in both monoallergen and polyallergen sensitised group.

We followed up for 2 years in the CM anaphylaxis children with SOTI and non-SOTI, and compared to milk tolerance levels and casein specific IgG4 in two groups. Method: Twenty nine (mean age of 5.6 years, Male/Female; 18/11) enrolled to SOTI and 16 children (mean age of 5.4 years, Male/Female; 6/10) received CM-removal guidance with documented IgE-mediated milk allergy history and underwent physician-supervised oral food challenges.

In anaphylaxis group, 50% of cases completely tolerated to 200 ml and 50% tolerated 40-100 ml but five cases had severe anaphylaxis needed adrenalin injection at hospital at first year SOTI. One case with anaphylaxis before and during SOTI had completely tolerated by SOTI but developed to FDEIAn to CM at 1 year after SOTI. Nobody of elimination group had tolerance to the small amount CM after 2 years elimination. Casein sIgE decreased significantly in SOTI and not in non-SOTI group. Casein sIgG4 significantly increased in SOTI group and no changed at very low levels in non-SOTI group. Casein sIgG4 were positive correlation with tolerance levels of CM.

Background: Patients suffering from HDM respiratory allergic disease may experience a considerable time span from onset of symptoms until an appropriate intervention. The purpose of this pilot survey was to investigate the time to diagnosis at either a General Practitioner (GP) or Specialist Physician (SP) and the time to treatment for patients with HDM respiratory allergic disease. Method: A qualitative pilot study comprising open ended questions was conducted among 24 SPs as individual interviews to uncover personal motivation in a session expecting to last 60 min. Responses reflected practice of the SPs being interviewed and the time estimates reflect the experience of patients in the care of the interviewed SPs. The SPs had been practicing between 3 and 29 years and spent more than 60% in direct patient care including treatment choice and initiation for HDM respiratory allergic disease. The survey was conducted in Germany and France and the results are presented as a descriptive summary as no statistical analyses was performed. Results: The average time from onset of symptoms until the patient presented to a GP was 2-3 years (range: 0-30 years). Common reasons for delay were patients' self-medication and hope that symptoms will resolve. The average time from presentation to the GP until referral to SP was 1-2 years (range: 2 weeks-10 years). The most common reasons were lack of GPs' awareness about HDM respiratory allergic disease and treatment options available at the specialist level. After referral to a specialist, the average time to specific diagnosis was 2 months (range: 0-1 year) and 1-2 weeks (range: 0-3 months) in France and Germany, respectively. Reasons for the delay were the SPs' need to assess diagnosis, disease severity, and optimise symptomatic treatment. After diagnosis and treatment optimisation, for those patients who were still uncontrolled, the average time to allergen immunotherapy was 2 months-1 year (range: 0-2 years). Conclusion: The time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis and appropriate treatment in patients suffering from HDM respiratory allergic disease was found to be up to 5 years suggesting a risk of having poor disease control for years. This qualitative pilot study uncovers a knowledge gap with patients and with GPs' about HDM respiratory allergic disease and stresses the need for improving patient information and raising awareness among physicians about HDM respiratory allergic disease and its treatment options. Background: ARIA guidelines recommend IT to be considered in allergic patients with poor control despite symptomatic treatment (64% of allergic patients in specialist care). We report findings from a pilot survey conducted to investigate attitudes towards initiating IT among specialist physicians (SPs) and patients with HDM respiratory allergic disease. Method: A qualitative pilot study comprising open ended questions was conducted among 24 adult patients. They were selected if diagnosed within the past two years based on the ARIA criteria for moderate to severe HDM induced allergic rhinitis AE concomitant allergic asthma. The study was conducted in France and Germany by interviewing in each country six patients who had been prescribed IT previously and six patients who had not. Interviews took place separately in the groups to facilitate sharing disease experience. Outcomes from the patient interviews were complemented with 24 individual SP interviews with a separate qualitative open ended questionnaire to uncover personal attitudes. SPs had been practicing between 3 and 29 years and spent more than 60% in patient care including treatment choice and initiation for HDM respiratory allergic disease. Results are presented as a descriptive summary. Results: Barriers among SPs: The most frequently mentioned reasons were 'inconvenience or incompliance' (i.e. patients reject IT due to inconvenience, or SPs or patients suspect that incompliance will be an issue) (n = 27), 'polysensitisation or comorbidities' (n = 16), and 'lack of knowledge of IT or concerns of side effects' (n = 12). SPs had a misperception of not being able to use IT in combination with symptomatic medication (n = 10), did not consider the condition to be severe enough for IT (n = 10), and admitted to be unaware that respiratory allergic disease may progress if left untreated (n = 10).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1548"}, {"text": "Barriers among patients: Primary mentioned reasons were lack of knowledge of how IT works or concerns about potential side effects (n = 11).

Pharmacokinetics studies revealed they exert sublingual tolerogenic mechanisms and some systemic effects after swallowing. Different modalities of mucosal administration were compared to explore the contribution of sublingual and oral absorption. Method: Adults with respiratory miteallergy, in addition to daily cetirizine randomly received monoid (1000 UA twice/ week) for 3 years with three intake modalities: sublingual/spit (SSP), oral or sublingual/swallow (SSW). A control group received cetirizine alone. Upper (UAS) and lower (LAS) airways symptoms, ondemand nasal steroids (NS) and salbutamol (B2) were registered with 6-month diary card in winter. Nasal eosinophils (EOS) were compared season by season, bronchial reactivity (MCH), lung function (FEV), and skin sensitisations at the beginning and after 3 years. Results: Eighty patients concluded the study. A significant improvement was observed in all outcomes with all modalities in respect to controls. Notably SSW was superior to both oral and SSP in reducing UAS, LAS, NCS, EOS, and improving FEV. Oral was equivalent to SSW in reducing the use of B2; oral was also equivalent to SSP in reducing UAS, LAS, B2, FEV, MCH and superior on NCS and EOS. The MCH threshold increase determined by SPP was inferior to SSW but not to oral. Only SSW appeared protective upon the onset of new sensitisations.

More than 80% of EoE patients are sensitised to aero-and/or food allergens. Immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated immune responses to microbes were reported to deteriorate atopic diseases. The aim of this study was to obtain a comprehensive overview about the sensitisation profile of EoE patients. Method: Specific IgE in sera of 35 patients with active EoE were analyzed to Candida albicans as well as to a panel of recombinant and purified natural allergen components using a microarray. Results: IgE sensitisation to Candida albicans was found in 43% of EoE patients. More than 80% of EoE patients were sensitised to aeroallergens and 22% to foodspecific allergen components. Sixty nine% of the patients exhibited specific IgE to cross-reactive allergens. Among them, profilins were identified as most frequent IgE cross-reactive allergen components. Interestingly, dysphagia the main symptom of adult EoE patients, following rice and/or bread ingestion was associated with sensitisation to cross-reactive allergens such as profilins, pathogenesis-related 10 and lipid transfer proteins whereas intolerance of meat rarely correlated with sensitisation to animal food allergens. Conclusion: Candida albicans and crossreactive plant allergen components in particular profilins were identified as frequent sensitisers in adult EoE patients. Specific elimination therapies are suggested to reveal their actual role in the pathogenesis of EoE. Background: It could be shown that household peanut consumption is a risk factor for the development of peanut allergy. Thereby cutaneous exposure to food allergens may be an important way of sensitisation. As house dust is a potent allergen vehicle and as it is easily distributed in all domestic areas, we aimed to investigate whether peanut allergens are detectable in house dust and whether the peanut level correlates with the household peanut consumption. Method: 21 households were included in the study. All participants completed a questionnaire regarding dietary habits concerning peanuts and cleaning habits. Dust samples were collected in the habitual eating area and from bed sheets, using a special vacuum cleaner device. Peanut protein was extracted and peanut allergen levels were measured with a commercially available ELISA (range of quantification: 2.5-20 ppm). Eight selected households with low peanut-allergen baseline levels were asked to consume roasted peanut snacks in their habitual eating areas. Forty-eight hours later, dust samples were collected. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was calculated to evaluate the relation between peanut levels and peanut consumption. Wilcoxon rank test was used to compare peanut levels before and after peanut consumption. Results: In 17 of 21 households peanut was detectable in the habitual eating areas and in 20 households on bed sheets. Comparing the frequency of peanut consumption to peanut levels in house dust, we found a moderate correlation of peanut consumption and peanut levels in the habitual eating areas (r = 0.595, P < 0.01) but not on the bed sheets. In 8 households with low peanut levels at baseline (range 1.4-14 lg/g) we could measure significantly increased peanut levels after peanut consumption, in the habitual eating areas (range 6.4-59.5 lg/g) as well as on the bed sheets (range 4.4-57.8 lg/g).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Poster Session 69"}, {"text": "In summary, peanut allergens were detectable in the house dust, not only in areas where peanuts are habitually eaten but also in the bed where peanut is usually not consumed, indicating a spreading of food allergens within the household.

Method: Male C3H/HeOuJ mice were orally sensitised with whey protein and cholera toxin (CT) or CT alone, once a week for 5 weeks and subsequently orally challenged with whey protein once. Starting two weeks before first sensitisation, mice were kept on an omega-3 PUFA diet or control diet.

Background: Recently we have demonstrated that dietary supplementation with tuna oil rich in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) largely prevents allergic sensitisation in a mouse model for cow's milk allergy (CMA). Aim was to assess whether high eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) vs high DHA fish oil differ in allergy prevention early in life in food allergy. Method: Mice were fed a control (soy oil), EPA (EPA rich fish oil) or DHA (tuna oil) diet before and during oral sensitisation with whey protein or peanut extract. Acute allergic skin response, serum immunoglobulins and T-cell proliferation and subsets were determined. In addition, peanut or whey hyperimmune serum high in IgE was passively transferred to na\u20ac \u0131ve recipient mice fed the different diets. These mice were challenged intradermally in the ear with the respective antigens. Results: The acute allergic skin response was reduced in DHA fed peanut allergic (PA) mice as compared to control or EPA diet fed mice. In CMA mice both EPA and DHA reduced the acute allergic skin response, however whey-specific immunoglobulins were suppressed most pronounced in DHA mice. The DHA diet also reduced T-cell proliferation in spleen of PA mice, and cytokine secretion showed the same tendency. The percentage of activated Th2 cells was reduced in mesenteric lymph nodes of CMA mice fed DHA as compared to controls. In addition, DHA but not EPA did enhance regulatory Tcells in the small intestine of PA mice. Furthermore, fish oil fed na\u20ac \u0131ve recipients passively sensitised using hyperimmune serum had diminished allergic symptoms upon allergen challenge. For whey this response was significantly lower in DHA fed mice compared to EPA, indicating that suppression of the effector response is most effective by DHA. Conclusion: Fish oil largely prevents allergic sensitisation in a mouse model for CMA and reduces allergic symptoms caused by peanut extract. Tuna oil high in DHA is more effective than fish oil rich in EPA in the prevention of allergic sensitisation and symptoms in food allergic mice.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion:"}, {"text": "Kinetic of in vitro response to blactoglobulin in children allergic and tolerant to cow's milk protein Background: Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) affects 2-6% of children. About 80-90% of children allergic to cow's milk protein (CMP) outgrow their allergy within their fifth year of age. The profile of the immune responses to the main CMP in the different clinical condition has not been completely elucidated. In this report we describe two children (P1 and P2) with CMPA in whom we performed a long clinical and immunological follow up. P1, with a history of bronchospasm and atopic dermatitis after introduction of cow\u2032s milk and CMP positive diagnostic tests (T1), after elimination diet, developed first a selective tolerance to milk derivatives (T2) and then complete tolerance to CMP (T3). P2, with a history of angioedema and urticaria after introduction of milk formula (T1) and anaphylaxis after accidental assumption of cow milk (T2), still does not tolerate CMP (T3). Method: At the three different time points (T1, T2 and T3), PBMC of patients were collected and stimulated with an extract of b-lactoglobulin (BLG), and in parallel, with 22 peptides of BLG (20 aminoacid long, overlapping of 10).

In both patients we detected a selective response to the peptides 9-12 of BLG, indicating that this region contains a common BLG epitope. In P1, the proliferation to the peptides 9-12 showed a trend similar to that of BLG. In P2, on the contrary, T cell proliferation persisted elevated, as well as the response to the peptides 9-12. Furthermore, in P1, IL-10 and TNF-a declined gradually, whereas, in P2, IL-10 was unchanged and TNF-a increased markedly over time. IL-4 was not detectable at any time in both patients, whereas IL-5, undetectable in P1, increased over time in P2. IL-9, IL-13 and IL-17 levels decreased with similar trend in both patients.

Results: Eight patients aged 9 to 41 years old were characterised. Five were males and the majority (5) was of Chinese ethnicity. An atopic history was found in five individuals. The symptoms of anaphylaxis included cutaneous manifestations such as urticaria (n = 8), angioedema (n = 6), respiratory symptoms of dyspnea and wheezing (n = 4), and hypotension (n = 5). The symptoms occurred between 5 min to 2 h after consumption of wheat-based products and various forms of exercise [running (n = 4), walking (n = 3) and swimming (n = 1)]. The WDEIA was recurrent in six patients. The skin prick tests were positive to wheat in five patients and omega 5-gliadin test to wheat was positive in 2. Conclusion: With the emergence of wheat allergy in East Asian countries, WDEIA has become an important condition for physicians and Singapore is no exception. Under-recognition combined with life threatening symptoms warrants better public awareness measures. In addition further studies are necessary to identify possible unique genetic and environmental exposures that could in part explain the interregional differences of WDEIA. Background: Although not detailed studies have been carried out in allergy to sunflower seed (Helianthus annuus), this is an important cause of food allergy and/or sensitisation in many populations. The aim was to study a large group of sensitised subjects to sunflower. Method: We performed a search in the data base belonging to the Spanish network for the study of adverse reactions to drug and allergens (RIRAAF). All those with skin prick test positive were considered hypersensitive and they were included in the study. Four major groups were subclassified as detailed below. Specific IgE to sunflower and ELISA inhibition studies to sunflower, Lipid transfer proteins, LTPs (Pru p3 and Ara h9), Thaumatin-like proteins, TLPs (Act d 2) and 2S albumins (Ara h6) were carried out Results: A total of n = 200 cases was included with skin prick positive. From these 7% had anaphylaxis, 7.6% urticaria, 4% oral allergy syndrome and 82% tolerant. The analysis of the specific IgE response did not show any statistical differ-ences between the groups in the number of positives. Direct ELISA and inhibition studies showed that LTPs, TLPs, 2S albumins were relevant allergens in all groups although no differences in the recognition pattern were observed. Conclusion: In hypersensitivity reactions to Helianthus annuus a significant proportion of cases are tolerant, although anaphylaxis or other entities may be induced by sunflower allergens. Those belonging to different families were recognised in the sera of all the groups. Studies are in progress to identify the primary and the secondary sensitisation to the different sunflower allergens in order to better understanding these observations. Background: Sometimes drug reactions are caused by the excipients. Peanut allergy is increasing in our society. In some drugs, the peanut oil is used as an excipient. Method: Twenty six years old woman was referred to own service by drug reaction. She suffers of polycystic ovary and started treatment with progesterone (peanut oil excipient). In the second administration, she immediately presented hand, foot and oropharyngeal pruritus, tongue edema, generalise urticaria and respiratory distress. She went to the hospital and was treated with corticosteroids and antihistamines. She, previously had tolerated peanuts and nuts. and referred an oral allergy syndrome with pineapple and melon. Four months later she had a similar reaction with apple. Conclusion: The patient was diagnosed of LTP allergy. In our case, LTP may act as an excipient to hidden drug allergy. Metabolized vegetable oils, such as peanut oil can serve as adjuvants, increasing the immune response to antigens. Whipping or emulsifying peanut butter to prevent the oil from separating from the peanut solids bring more of the water soluble protein into direct contact with the oil, potentially increasing the immunogenicity of peanut proteins ingested in this manner. Highly refined peanut oil is usually tolerated by people with peanut allergy. However, processing variations exist and sources may not be easily traced, so avoidance of even refined peanut oils must be advisable.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1567"}, {"text": "The effect of maternal folic acid intake during pregnancy on incidence of child food allergy Abe, M Oita University of Nursing and Health Sciences, Human Biology, Oita, Japan Background: Food allergy is the most common in infants and young children. In Japan, intake of folic acid during pregnancy is recommended to prevent neural tube defects. Supplementary intake of folic acid during pregnancy has recently become increasingly common; thus, we have evaluated the effect of folic acid intake on the prevalence of food allergy in infants and young children. Method: A survey was conducted at the same location from July to October 2011 and from May to August 2012. Results: The average age of 2688 children was 18.6 AE 0.9 months. Only the existence of a child\u2032s food allergy was distinguished based on a doctor\u2032s diagnosis. The breakdown of those who developed allergies was 10.0% with food allergy, 8.3% with atopy, 5.9% with eczema, 4.1% with asthma. In addition, 41.5% of the pregnant mothers had taken folic acid supplements. Atopy occurred in 7.6% of children in the group where the mothers took folic acid supplements (FA+ group) compared with 9.0% in the group where the mothers did not take folic acid supplements (FA\u00c0 group). There was a downward trend in the FA+ group, but the difference was not significant (P = 0.064). Furthermore, asthma developed in 3.7% of children in the FA+ group compared with 4.5% in the FA\u00c0 group, which indicates that the effect of folic acid supplements was small. On the other hand, eczema occurred in 7.8% of children in the FA+ group compared with 4.6% in the FA\u00c0 group [odds ratio, 1.754 (95% confidence interval, 1.273-2.415)], which indicated that the percentage of allergic children increased based on folic acid intake. Food allergy occurred in 11.9% of children in the FA+ group compared with 8.6% in the FA\u00c0 group (odds ratio, 1.447). This suggests that children tend to have food allergy when their mothers take folic acid supplements during pregnancy. In particular, in mothers without an allergy, taking folic acid supplements increased food allergy onset in children without atopy [odds ratio, 1.991 (95% confidence interval, 1.233-3.215)]. Conclusion: A mother's intake of folic acid supplements during pregnancy affects the prevalence of allergies in their children. Background: Allergy to fruit and vegetables exhibit geographic variation regarding the severity of symptoms and depending on the sensitisation profile of the patient. These sensitisation profiles and routes remain incompletely understood. Cannabis is a very popular drug and derived from Cannabis sativa a plant containing lipid transfer proteins (LTP) also known as important allergens in plant and fruit allergies. In this study we sought elucidate on a potential connection between Cannabis sativa allergy (CSA) and plant food allergies Method: Case-control study involving 21 patients consulting for plant food allergies. Twelve patients were cannabis allergic and nine had a pollen or latex allergy without cannabis allergy. Testing for cannabis IgE implied measurement of sIgE, skin testing and basophil activation tests. Allergen component analysis was performed with a microarray technique Results: Plant food allergy in patients with documented cannabis allergy had more severe reactions than patients without cannabis allergy and frequently implied fruits and vegetables that are not observed in a (birch) pollen-related food syndrome. All, except one of the patients with cannabis allergy were sensitised to non-specific lipid transfer proteins Conclusion: Our data suggest that illicit cannabis abuse can result in cannabis allergy with sensitisation to non-specific lipid transfer proteins. This sensitisation might result in various plant-food allergies. Additional collaborative studies in different geographical areas are needed to further elucidate on this hypothesis. Background: Claims of marked increases in the prevalence of food allergy (FA) and celiac disease (CD) are common in the US and EU and increasingly in India where little is known about food allergy. Studies suggest increasing trends, but often lack rigorous definition of symptoms and tests. Reliance on Skin Prick Tests (SPT) or specific IgE alone, without corroborating clinical histories may be misleading. Once diagnosed, patients with FA or CD must avoid eliciting foods, which requires accurate information of food ingredients. Method: A prospective study in the Dept. of Pediatrics, SMS Medical College, Jaipur was carried out in hospitalised as well as out patients. Diagnosis of Food Allergy and Celiac Disease was made on the basis of history, clinical examination and laboratory investigations. Information has also been gathered from Nationally accredited laboratories conducting food allergy testing and national surveys. Results: Any food can be allergenic, Patterns of common allergens differ across regions and culturs, dairy, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts such as walnuts, almonds and cashews, fish, shellfish, soya, wheat, seasame top the list, Incidence of allergies to milk, eggs and wheat less frequent then in the West, Dals (Pulses) such as chickpeas more common allergy to rice has been reported, Food Allergy evenly distributed More in urban and semi urban areas as compared to rural areas, Changing food pattern moving away from Background: A new transglutaminase cross-linked caseinate (Excellion EM7 High Viscosity) was designed for the use in dairy products to increase the viscosity of food matrices. The difference in structure of the cross-linked caseinate compared to sodium caseinate might have implications for the risk of developing cow's milk allergy. The sensitising capacity and the allergenicity (the potency to induce an allergic effector response) of cross-linked sodium caseinate in comparison to sodium caseinate was investigated using a mouse model for cow's milk allergy. Method: Mice were orally sensitised with a blunt needle on day 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 with either 20 mg cross-linked caseinate or caseinate homogenised in saline mixed with 10 lg cholera toxin as an adjuvant. Nonsensitised mice received cholera toxin in PBS only. One week after the last oral sensitisation anaphylactic shock reactions, change in body temperature, and acute allergic skin responses were determined as clinical related symptoms for cow's milk allergy after an intradermal challenge with cross-linked caseinate or caseinate. Allergen-specific IgE and mMCP-1, as a reflection of intestinal mast cell degranulation, were measured in serum 30 min after an oral challenge to caseinate or cross-linked caseinate. Results: In contrast to mice sensitised to caseinate, sensitisation of mice with crosslinked caseinate did not result in any anaphylactic shock symptoms, a drop in body temperature or release of serum mMCP-1. A tendency towards decreased casein-specific IgE levels was observed in mice sensitised to cross-linked caseinate. The allergenicity (capacity to induce an allergic effector response in caseinate-sensitised animals) upon challenge with cross-linked caseinate was not significantly different from the caseinate. Conclusion: These results indicate that in already caseinate-sensitised mice, crosslinked caseinate did not provoke more pronounced allergenic reactions compared to sodium caseinate. On top of that, a reduced sensitisation to caseinate was observed in mice sensitised to cross-linked caseinate. Cross-linked caseinate might therefore be an interesting new dietary concept for humans at risk for food allergy although more mechanistic studies and clinical trials are needed for validation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1571"}, {"text": "Serum IgA and IgG antibodies to wheat gliadin and milk b-lactoglobulin in early infancy predict atopic sensitisation at school age Background: The introduction of food and bacterial antigens to the immune system is mainly conducted via the gut.

Children with sensitisation to any of the measured allergens at age 6 showed elevated levels of IgA and IgG against milk b-lactoglobulin (P < 0.001), and elevated levels of IgA and IgG against wheat gliadin (P = 0.013 and P = 0.002, respectively) at age 1. The children who were sensitised to inhaled allergens had elevated IgA and IgG against milk b-lactoglobulin (P = 0.009 and P = 0.015, respectively). There was no significant difference between children of farmers and non-farmers or asthmatics and non-asthmatics, although, children who had asthma at age six tended to have elevated IgA against gliadin at age 1 (P = 0.065). Conclusion: Increased production of antibodies to wheat gliadin and cow's milk blactoglobulin at age 1 was associated with sensitisation at age 6. We suggest that enhanced antibody response to food antigens at early age reflects aberrancies of mucosal tolerance, e.g. increased gut permeability or inflammation, which is later seen as sensitisation to allergens. Background: Poultry meat allergy is an unusual pathology. Most cases are associated with hypersensitivity to egg or with another allergen like parvalbumins. The aim of this study was to describe a case of poultry allergy and to identify the allergens for a correct diagnosis. Case report: A 38-year-old male, with no medical history, was studied. In the last 10 years, he referred dyspnea, labial angioedema, hives, itching and dysphagia after consuming well done poultry meat (chicken and turkey). Method: Skin prick tests to commercial meat extracts (chicken and ostrich) and hen's egg proteins were performed. Specific serum IgE against commercial poultry and egg proteins extracts was determined by CAP system Pharmacia. Specific serum IgE against extracts from raw and boiled meats (turkey, chicken, ostrich, duck and quail) was determined by EAST. Poultry allergens were studied by SDS-PAGE, IgE Immunobloting, 2D-Immunoblotting and Mass Spectrometry. Results: Skin prick tests to commercial meat extracts were positive. Skin prick tests to egg proteins were negative. Specific IgE to raw and boiled meats were positive. SDS-PAGE and Immunobloting with meat extracts showed some common prominent IgE-binding protein bands at 28 kD, 20 kD and 14 kD. The 2D Immunoblotting revealed three spots at 20-25 kD.

Camel milk allergy: an allergy that needs to be considered in some patients Background: Cow's milk is one of commonest food allergens in children. However, camel's milk allergy is almost unheard of. We wish to report these two cases to increase awareness on the existence of this type of food allergy. Case 1: A 3 \u00bd year old boy presented history of acute swelling of both lips while taking 'home-made food' at dinner at age of 2 years. He was managed at the Pediatric Emergency Center (PEC) and his lip swelling cleared 1 h after injections of adrenaline and Diphenhydramine. At age of 3 years, he had acute generalised urticaria, dyspnea, and wheezing 10 min after camel milk ingestion. He tolerates other dairy products quite well. Family history is positive for asthma. His lab work up revealed AEC count at 600 cells/ll, serum IgE 254 ku/l, and food-specific IgE [RIDA3 \u2122 ] was negative. Skin prick test was markedly positive to camel's milk. Case 2: A 4 \u00bd year old girl developed acute urticaria and facial angioedema immediately after ingestion of camel milk at home at age of 4 years. Her father is a camel breeder. She received treatment of anaphylaxis at PEC Al-Sadd (oxygen, B2adrenergic inhalations, adrenaline, steroids, IVF, Diphenhydramine). She is known to have atopic dermatitis and confirmed eosinophilic esophagitis and colitis. Her AEC count was 378 cells/ll, serum IgE 349 ku/l, and food-specific IgE [RIDA3 \u2122 ] was negative. Skin prick test was markedly positive to camel's milk. Conclusions: Camel's milk allergy is rare but still an existing food allergy. It should be considered in unexplained allergic reaction in patients living in areas where camel milk is consumed. Background: Fish allergy is usually due to sensitisation to parvalbumin which leads to cross reactivity among different species however allergy to one fish family as well as monosensitivity to one fish species with tolerance to others has been described, be it due to recognition of species or family specific parvalbumin or due to proteins of different molecular weights to that of parvalbumin. Pangasius is becoming ever more popular due to its economic price and boneless flesh, recently becoming the fastest growing fish product in the U.S market.Monosensitivity to Pangasius has been described in the past involving low molecular weight proteins. We hope to describe a new profile of three patients seen in our outpatients Department with monosensitivity to Pangasius due to a protein of a different weight to that described previously. Methods: Skin prick test with raw and cooked Pangasius and cod were done in each patient and in a control. We analyzed patient sera for specific IgE to fish species, shellfish, tropomyosin and parvalbumin. The proteins of allergenic extracts were transferred to PVDF membranes for subsequent Western blot assays. The recognition of proteins with similar molecular weights in extracts of different allergenic sources led to a more thorough study of their characteristics by Western blot inhibition and peptide fingerprinting. Results: None of the patients demonstrated specific IgE to parvalbumin neither did they react to prick tests with cod however 2 of the patients did have positive prick tests to Pangasius extracts. Western Blot: Sera did not recognise proteins of weights similar to that of parvalbumin however they did recognise a protein of approximately 37-43 kDa in Pangasius as well as in some fish and shellfish extracts leading us to suspect that the protein responsible could be Aldolase A (40 kDa), aldehyde phosphate dehydrogenas (41 kDa) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphsate dehydrogenase (36 kDa).Western blot inhibition: IgE fixation was inhibited by lobster, prawn and octopus extracts. Peptide fingerprinting revealed a protein with a nominal mass of 43065 and a sequence of AFKDEDTQAMPFR consistent with the crystal structure of uncleaved ovalbumin. Conclusion: We describe a series of cases of monosensitivity to Pangasius fish species due to a protein other than parvalbumin consistent with uncleaved ovalbumin not described previously. Objective: We report the case of a patient with suspected allergy to sunflower seeds which shows that the measurement of proteins that form part of the lipid fraction of foodstuffs may confirm the diagnosis of specific hypersensitivity to these foodstuffs. Materials and methods: A 42-year-old man with indolent systemic mastocytosis presented anaphylactic shock after eating 2-3 sunflower seeds.

Background: The spectrum of wheat hypersensitivity is extremely wide and making a clear diagnosis can be very challenging. Method: A 28-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for suspected wheat allergy. Two years before, she had started complaining of eructation, abdominal bloating, severe abdominal pain and diarrhoea few minutes after eating wheat-made products. For this reason she had started a wheat-free diet with relief. Gastroscopy and serological antibody screening for celiac disease were negative, HLA-DQ2 was positive. Skin Prick Test (SPT) and prick by prick with cereals, gliadin, alpha-amylase were negative, as well as for other foods allergens. Total IgE level was 28 UI/ml; specific IgE for gluten and other wheat-related allergens were <0.10 kU/l. Challenge-test with an alimentary product made of 3 g of wheat flour and salt was performed: few minutes after ingestion, the patient presented gastroesophageal spasms with continuous eructation and severe abdominal. The physical examination revealed an acute abdomen with hyperperistalsis. Metilprednisolone and scopolamine were administrated intravenously, with a partial remission, but 2 h later the patient was still symptomatic and was readmitted to our Emergency Department; scopolamine 20 mg and metilprednisolone 20 mg were administrated with relief but complete resolution was achieved only after one week. Gastroscopy, performed 2 weeks after wheat-challenge, was negative. Basophil activation test (BAT) performed before the challenge was weakly positive for alpha-amylase and negative for gliadin (CD63 = 5.5%, stimulation index (SI) = 2.4, CD63 = 2.0, SI = 0.9, respectively). BAT repeated 2 weeks after the challenge remained unchanged for alphaamylase (CD63 = 5.0%, SI = 2.4) and was increased for gliadin (CD63 = 8.3%, SI = 4.0). BAT for all the other cereals tested resulted negative both before and after the challenge. Results: After the positivity of the challenge-test, the absolute remission of symptoms with the wheat-free diet and the positivity of the BAT for gliadin and for alpha-amylase, we concluded for acute hypersensitivity to gliadin and alpha-amylase, characterised by gastrointestinal motility disorders. Conclusion: We believe that, in some cases, particularly when total IgE are very low, BAT associated with challenge test might be a useful tool to better characterise 'Gluten hypersensitivity' syndrome. Background: The crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), also known as red crawfish or American crawfish is a decapod crustacean belonging to the family Cambaridae, largely distributed throughout the world. Despite its wide consumption there are very few documented cases of allergic reaction after ingestion. We report a case of anaphylaxis after intake of Procambarus clarkii. Method: A 22-year-old woman presented 13 years ago an episode of cutaneous erythema with pruritus, dyspnea, dysphagia and diarrhea immediately after the ingestion of Procambarus clarkii. She needed emergency assistance and was treated with methylprednisolone i.m. improving within 1-2 h. After the reaction, she has avoided eating crawfish, but she has tolerated other crustaceans and molluscs. The patient\u2032s medical history was relevant for atopic dermatitis and asthma with sensitisation to grass and Platanus pollens and house dust mites. Results: Skin prick tests with inhalant allergens proved positive for grass and Platanus pollens and house dust mites, and were negative with commercial food extracts, latex, Anisakis, cockroach, profilin and peach LTP (Pru p 3). Prick-prick with cooked crayfish was positive and negative with raw crayfish. Total IgE was elevated (1416 IU/ml) and specific IgE to crayfish (Astacus astacus) and shrimp (CAP, Phadia) proved negative. Immunoblotting was carried out with extracts of raw and cooked shrimp (only meat) and crayfish (meat and shell). The patient\u2032s serum recognised several bands, especially intense in cooked crayfish (meat and shell), between 30 and 45 kDa, and other less intense about 74, 15 and 20 kDa. The same bands, weaker, also appeared in the raw crayfish meat. In cooked shrimp, bands about 74, 48 and 6 kDa were identified. None of the bands seem to correspond to tropomyosin. Conclusion: We report a case of anaphylaxis due to hypersensitivity to Procambarus clarkii with good tolerance to other crustacean, an event rarely reported. Skin tests and immunoblotting support our diagnosis. Our immunoblotting identified different proteins than those reported in other cases.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Allergy to bird and mammalian meat"}, {"text": "An interesting case of asthma compllicated by food allergy that renders the disease difficult to control Bulut, _ I; \u20ac Ozs \u00dfeker, ZF Sureyyapasa Chest Diseases and Chest Surgery Training Hospital, Immunology and Allergy, Istanbul, Turkey Case presentation: Twenty five years old woman N.T applied to our clinic with rhinitis and complaints suggestive of asthma. The skin prick test result was erythema (E): 14 9 12 mm, wheal (W): 11 9 12 mm, dog epithel was E: 5 9 5 mm, cat epithel was W: 5 9 5 mm. The diagnosis was allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma. Allergic rhinitis treatment was started. Also, budesonid-formeterol 160/4.5 lg 2 9 1 regimen was started for asthma. Clinical follow-up revealed frequent night symptoms and frequent need for beta-2 agonist use. The patient was applying to emergency service with an asthma attack at least once a week. Although all possible medications capable of controlling the disease had been given in combination, these symptoms were not under control. Upon further questioning the patient with regard to dietary habits it was revealed that she was under a strict diet because of her overweight and therefore had a regular intake of a bisuict that contains rye bran and oat. Then, another skin prick test was done with flour panel. Rye flour was measured as 5 9 5 mm which indicated rye allergy. She was adviced to avoid foods that contain rye. Her symptoms improved dramatically thereafter. She didn't apply to emergency services anymore. It was thought that the ineffectivity of the drug therapy resulted from rye flour allergy, which also caused respiratory anaphylaxis attacks. Conclusion: In the case of uncontrolled asthma, the possibility of food allergy and food related respiratory anaphylaxis should be considered. Background: The development of egg allergy in the late adulthood is rare. In most of the cases manifestation of the clinical symptoms begins in childhood or early adulthood. Adult-onset egg allergy usually develops either as an occupational disease inflicting workers in bakery and confectionery industries or a bird-egg syndrome caused by cross-reactivity in patients suffering from bird feather sensitivity. Herein we present an adult-onset primary egg allergy appeared differently from the previously reported cases. A 50-year-old housewife presented with a history of uvula oedema, itching of the throat and mouth, urticaria and dyspnea necessitating epinephrine, antihistaminic and steroid administration following ingestion of baked egg 12 years ago. These symptoms recurred by eating well-cooked egg con-taining foods such as pastry. She had no symptoms after cessation of ingesting egg and egg-containing foods. Method: A skin prick test (SPT) with a wide panel of food allergens and common aeroallargens (Allergopharma, Hamburg, Germany) was performed. The serum specific IgE to egg white and yolk was measured by using CAP system (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Results: The SPT was found to be positive with egg yolk, egg white and whole (5, 9 and 9 mm, respectively) . Serum specific IgE to egg white and yolk was positive at 1.22 kU/l (+2) and 0.44 kU/l (+1), respectively. Conclusion: The present case is unique in that she developed adult-onset egg allergy presenting with anaphylaxis and neither had a history of occupational exposure nor had a sensitivity to animal epithelium. Results: The patient was diagnosed of milk allergy at 4 months age, showing urticaria after her first feeding bottle. Her five years older sister, currently tolerant, also had milk allergy. In July 2012, she suffers of an asthma crisis after eating a candy, which the house caretaker had given her. She starts daycare center on 25 October 2012. An allergic children\u2032s dinning room worker gave her a croquette and the patient immediately showed erythema, urticaria, vomit and dyspnea. The worker took the child to HCD emergency service, where epinephrine was administered and she stayed under surveillance for 24 h. On December 2012, an egg allergic child gave her some pur ee at the daycare center dining room, provoking urticaria, dyspnea and loss of consciousness. She is aided by the daycare doctor, who is unable to provide the required epinephrine dose using an autoinjector after several attempts. The doctor called an ambulance and the child was brought to HCD emergency service, where she was treated with epinephrine and recovered within 48 h. The daycare center informed the child\u2032s parents that she could not use the center dining room, as they could not prevent the patient to have similar problems in the future. HCD provided the parents with an urgent treatment, including drugs prescription. They were also informed about the therapeutic alternatives, including desensitisation or omalizumab, and also about the Spanish Food Allergy Children Parents\u2032 Association. Control and monitoring visits every two months were scheduled. The daycare doctor was contacted to inform her about anaphylaxis treatment with epinephrine, the use of GALAXIA (Spanish Guide for Anaphylaxis Management) and the Stop Anaphylaxis initiative. Conclusion: This case shows the serious health, social, economic and educational problems behind some anaphylaxis diagnoses. In the patient\u2032s parents words, 'a nightmare'. Background: Hen\u2032s eggs are one of the major causes of food allergies especially in childhood. Increasing egg consumption of other birds species such as quail, goose, duck or partridge has facilitated the development of sensitisation to proteins of these eggs Method: A 41 year-old-woman with antecedents of rhinoconjuctivitis and asthma due to pollens and danders, was referred for presenting oropharyngeal itching, lips swelling, facial and uvula edema and dysphagia immediately after eating cooked quail egg.

Background: Different studies demonstrate an increased prevalence of latex sensitisation in health care workers, ranging 9% to 12%.Latex allergic reactions can range from mild skin rashes to severe and lifethreatening anaphylactic shock. Latex gloves are associated with three types of adverse reactions: irritant contact dermatitis, immediate-type, and allergic contact dermatitis. Latex has cross reactions with different foods and consuming them may cause allergic reactions to the persons allergic to latex. Method: We present a 25-year-old patient, working as a nurse for the last 3 years. Few minutes after consuming banana, at her home, she had difficulty in breathing, cough, hypotension, generalised itching and urticaria. She was shifted to emergency room, and received subcutaneus adrenaline, prednisolone, antihistamine and oxygen. She was discharged of the hospital two days later. At her workplace, she mostly used latex gloves. A first skin manifestation occurred 2 years before and was described as contact dermatitis which disappeared 1 week after local therapy with corticosteroids, but she never performed allergy tests. Nearby the same time, she began to have sneezing, runny nose, itchy and watery eyes, at spring time. After she performed allergy tests she resulted: allergic to banana in prick by prick and had positive IgE for banana, negative skin prick test to aeroallergens and positive prick by prick test for latex. Discussion: It is reported that more than 50% of latex-sensitised people had specific IgE antibodies to proteins for some kind of fruits and vegetables. About 1/3 of the patients, experience immediate-type reactions when they ingest foods such as avocado, banana, chestnut, kiwi and potato. Populations at risk for developing latex allergies are: patients with spina bifida and congenital genitourinary abnormalities, health care workers, atopic patients. In case of an allergic reaction it is the possibility that the reaction may vary from urticaria to anaphylactic reactions In our case the patient developed anaphylaxis after eating banana. Conclusion: Latex-fruit syndrome is a cross-reaction that may seriously risk patient life; in this case it is needed to inform the patients about the possible risks for cross-reaction between latex and food. It is needed a very careful medical history, skin prick testes with latex and with different fruits vegetables and specific IgE measurement for latex and foods cross reacting with latex.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1591"}, {"text": "Atopy and the risk for food, drug and latex allergy Background: Generally atopy is defined as a genetic disposition to develop allergic diseases such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, or atopic dermatitis. It is also known as an increased capacity to produce IgE response to common environmental antigens. This study intends to measure the relative risk of atopic individuals to develop allergy to food, drug and latex. Method: In a cross-sectional study, 639 nurses (from 662 that were asked for) at the UHC 'Mother Theresa' in Tirana, accepted to fill up a questionnaire where questions about personal atopy, food, drug and latex allergy were included. About 589 were females and they have a mean age 43.28 (+10.71) years. We considered atopic every person that has at least any of the atopic diseases (allergic rhinitis, asthma, or atopic dermatitis). The chi-square test and the RR with a 95% CI were calculated for each case. MS Excel 2007 and PASW Statistics 18 were used to analyze the data. Results: 20.81% (133) of nurses reported to have had at least one of the atopic diseases. No differences in prevalence of atopy were observed between two sexes. The RR for the atopic individuals to develop allergies to foods resulted 4.44 (95% CI = 2.42 to 8.16, P < 0.05) while the RR for this category to develop allergic symptoms to latex were 5.08 (95% CI = 3.17 to 8.13, P < 0.05). Atopic individuals had a RR of 1.45 to develop allergic symptoms to different drugs (95% CI = 0.94 to 2.23, P < 0.05) compared to non-atopic ones. Conclusion: The presence of atopic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis bears a significant increased risk of developing allergies to foods latex, and drugs. Background: Food allergy is common problem. Epidemiological data are very poor because of diagnostic difficulties. According to ECAP study (www.ecap.pl) about 7% of Polish population suffer from food allergy. Simple screening is expected in premedical diagnosis. Method: The questionnaire study was conducted 2012 in the primary schools of Warsaw. The sample was randomised. About 1801 full questionnaires were collected and verified. The response rate was 53.5%. Questionnaire consisted of 58 questions in four sections: basic information, diet and nutrition, health status and information about the guardian. Results: The prevalence of food allergy in children at early school age (6-8 yrs) based on declarations of their parents was 36.9% (95% CI 34.7-39.2%). In 12.2% of children with food allergy doctor diagnosed disease in the first month of life. In 79.6% of cases food allergy was confirmed by a physician. In 48.4% between 2nd and 12th months of age.

The primary strategy currently used in CMA management is the dietary elimination. However, desensitisation or tolerance induction seems to be promising as an alternative treatment in children who have not built up tolerance spontaneously. The aim of our study was to evaluate all children with CMA who started the Specific Oral Tolerance Induction (SOTI) protocol. Method: Retrospective study from 2006 to 2012 based on clinical records' review. Children with CMA and age more or equal than 2 years and positive oral provocation tests were submitted to a semi-rush SOTI protocol. Demographic and clinical data were analyzed. Free diet was considered when tolerance achieved was 200 ml of milk or one yogurt/day. Results: Twenty-seven clinical records were reviewed, 20 (74.1%) were male, with mean age at the beginning of protocol 6.6 years (SD AE 4.2) and median duration 21 weeks . Twenty-one (77.8%) achieved the end of protocol, 15 (71.4%) of them are in free diet and 6 (28.6%) are in restrictive diet, tolerating from 2 to 50 ml of milk. Six (22.2%) didn't achieve the end of protocol (2 were lost to follow-up, 1 re-started the protocol and in 3 the protocol is in progress). Initial specific IgE for cow's milk was <class 3 in 4 (14.8%) cases and \u2265class 3 in 18 (66.6%) and at the end of protocol <class 3 in 1 (4.8%) and \u2265class 3 11 (52.4%). There were no differences in age at the beginning (P = 0.243) and duration of protocol (P = 0.051) in free diet group vs restrictive diet. Sixteen (59.3%) children had adverse reactions, 13 (81.3%) presented respiratory symptoms. Most of them had mild adverse reactions, treated in hospital. Conclusion: SOTI led to a reduction of risk of severe allergic reactions with no episodes of anaphylaxis in real life and an improvement of quality of life. Background: The use of dietary treatment in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in children was promoted in updated consensus recommendations. In this study we evaluated anthropomorphic and biological parameters in EoE children before and after elimination diet. Method: 87 consecutive patients with EoE (>15 eosinophils/hpf in esophageal biopsies) were retrospectively analyzed. All children followed the so-called modified sixfood elimination diet (SFED), excluding 6 main offending foods retrieved together with those eliciting positive SPT and APT, supplemented with a nutritional support by an amino acid formula. Patients followed the next treatment sequence: endoscopy/ clinical/biological assessment, 3 months elimination diet and second endoscopy/ clinical/ biological assessment. Results: Forty nine patients were included in analysis. At enrolment, BMI was significantly lower in females than in males (P < 0.05), and total circulating IgG and IgM levels were higher in females (P < 0.05). At the end of the study recovered patients had at enrolment a BMI significantly higher than those showing only partial or no recovery (P < 0.05). Elimination diet led to complete recovery (no symptoms & <5 eosinophils/hpf) in 53% cases. Following the elimination diet, BMI remained lower in females than in males. Also, blood eosinophils counts (P < 0.0001), IgG (p0.003) and IgM levels (p0.05) showed a significant decrease as well as IgE titers against CMP (P < 0.02) and egg (P < 0.02), with a tendency for decrease for fish (p 0.09) and wheat (p 0.09).

The skin state was assessed with the use of SCO-RAD scale twice: before and after the four weeks lasting elimination diet. Results: The most numerous group of patients, 25% (n = 8) of patients indicated milk as the main food factor worsening the course of atopic dermatitis. The majority of positive skin prick tests were caused by chammomile (n = 6; 18.8%). Twelve subjects showed elevated specific IgE serum concentrations against potato allergens (37.5%), while 11 subjects (34.4%) were positive to cow milk proteins. Significant improvement of the skin condition to the extent that enabled shift to lower class of severity was observed in 60% (n = 6) of patients in the severe group, and in 18.9% (n = 2) of patients in the moderate group. None in the mild group observed a positive influence of diet on the skin. Conclusion: Food hypersensitivity contributes to atopic dermatitis pathogenesis. The elimination diet provides benefit in the treatment of moderate/severe form of the disease. Sensitisation/allergy to peanut Alves, C; Romeira, A; Pinto, PL Department of Immunoallergology, Hospital Dona Estef\u00e2nia, Lisboa, Portugal Background: Food allergy occurs in 6-8% of the children and 3-4% of the adults. Allergic reactions to peanuts are particularly severe, with frequent anaphylactic reactions. Peanut allergy usually begins in childhood and often persists throughout life. The aim of our study was to evaluate the peanut sensitisation/allergy evolution for a 6-year period in a group of patients previously studied. Method: A study was conducted in order to find the prevalence of peanut sensitisation and allergy in a population followed in the Immunoallergology Department of Dona Estef\u00e2nia Hospital. Skin prick tests (SPT) and a questionnaire about the ingestion of peanut were carried out in 2006 and 2012 to evaluate the peanut sensitisation/ allergy. We included all of the 1415 patients who performed SPT to aeroallergens during the year of 2006 in our department. We reassess in 2012 the sensitised patients. Results: In 2006, the prevalence of sensitisation found was 2.8% (40 patients with positive peanut SPT), of whom 5 had symptoms with peanut ingestion, matching an allergy prevalence of 0.4%. Of the 40 patients, 19 were re-evaluated in 2012 (3 allergic and 16 with asymptomatic sensitisation in 2006). The three patients allergic kept peanut eviction with no reported accidental ingestion or symptoms since 2006. The SPT remained positive. Of the 16 patients with asymptomatic sensitisation, 12 maintained positive peanut SPT and four had negative peanut SPT. Of these 12 patients with SPT positive (asymptomatic in 2006), two reported symptoms after peanut ingestion (eczema and angioedema/ tightness of the oropharynx), corresponding to new allergies.

The route of administration affects its rate of absorption, and intramuscular delivery is recommended for optimal onset of action. Two epinephrine autoinjectors are commercially available to adult patients in Canada: Epipen \u00e2 and Twinject \u00e2 . Epipen \u00e2 has a needle length of 14.3 mm. Each Twinject delivers 2 doses of epinephrine; the needle length of the first dose is 12.7 mm, and the second dose is 14.3 mm. Little is known about the adequacy of these autoinjector needle lengths in delivering epinephrine intramuscularly in adult patients at risk for anaphylaxis. Method: Fifty nine consecutive adult patients (21 male and 38 female) with confirmed food or venom allergy requiring prescriptions or refills of epinephrine autoinjector at an Allergist's office were recruited for the study. Skin to muscle depth (STMD) at the right mid-anterolateral thigh was measured using ultrasound by a single operator under minimal (min) and maximum (max) pressure, estimated to be 2-8lbs. The needle length is considered adequate if STMD max was \u226414.3 mms. Two groups of patients with: 1) STMD max \u226414.3 mms and 2) STMD max >14.3 mms were compared. Baseline characteristics including age, gender, ethnicity, allergen, nature of reaction, concurrent medical problems, BMI and medications were compared. Results: Baseline characteristics such as age and weight did not significantly differ among the two groups. The mean STMD max among those with \u226414.3 and >14.3 mm were significantly different (8.20 AE 2.78 and 17.58 AE 4.46 mm respectively; P value = 0.0001). Under maximum pressure, the standard needle length is inadequate for intramuscular delivery of epinephrine in 18 (30.5%) patients, all of whom were female.

Methods: Twenty-two children with food allergy observed between 2004 and 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients underwent skin prick (or prick-prick) tests and specific IgE determination. Unambiguous history, response to eviction diet and oral food challenge confirmed the diagnosis. Results: Mean age was 9 years old (range 3-15) and male to female ratio was 2.4. Family history of atopic disease was found in 20%; individual history of respiratory atopy was found in 53% of patients (9% suffered from rhinitis and 53% rhinitis and asthma).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion:"}, {"text": "Allergens most commonly involved were peanut (66.7%) and cashew (14.3%), followed by hazelnut (4.76%), walnut (4.76%), pistachio (4.76%) and Indian chestnut (4.76%). The clinical manifestations included anaphylaxis (41%), urticaria (24%), angioedema (20%) and atopic dermatitis (6%); 9% were asymptomatic. Mean specific IgE for the culprit allergen involved was 28.3 kU/l (range 0.35-100 kU/l). Four patients revealed a value of >100 kU/l for peanut IgE: 2 suffered from anaphylaxis, 1 had facial angioedema, and 1 was asymptomatic. The majority of patients had symptoms on the first known ingestion. Two oral provocation tests were performed: one was positive for peanut (oral allergy syndrome and urticaria) and one was negative for hazelnut. Mean wheal diameter was 10.5 mm. Conclusion: This study points to the existence, in Portugal, of allergy not only to peanut but also to tree nuts in very young children and highlights the emergence of tree nuts allergy as being responsible for severe reactions. Background: There have been some reports recently on how food allergy impacts on Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) of children. The effect of food challenge outcomes on HRQoL has also been studied. We determined HRQoL in children with a diagnosed food allergy vs. those who were avoiding a food due to a perceived food allergy, using a validated questionnaire (FAQLQ-PF) by DunnGalvin et al. Method: We recruited 41 children (age 10 years); 23 with diagnosed food allergies and 18 children who were avoiding a food due to a perceived food allergy into this study. All these children are enrolled in the FAIR birth cohort study. Those with a diagnosed food allergy were either diagnosed by the FAIR study team in the past or the David Hide Asthma and Allergy Research Centre on the Isle of Wight. We compared the effect of food allergy vs. perceived food allergy using the domains specified in the FAQLQ-PF questionnaire: Food Anxiety, Emotional Impact, Social and Dietary Limitations and also HRQoL. Results: Using the Independent sample Ttest, we found no significant difference between the two groups (diagnosed food allergy vs. perceived food allergy) in terms of Emotional Impact (mean: 1.39, SD: 0.99 vs. mean: 1.17, SD: 1.43; P = 0.5), Social and Dietary Limitations (mean: 1.78, SD; 1.36 vs. mean: 1.24, SD: 1.47; P = 0.3) and HRQOL (mean: 1.75, SD; 1.44 vs. mean 1.6, SD; 1.33; P = 0.15).

This disorder is characterised by the onset of rectal bleeding, generally in children younger than 2 months of age. The majority of infants will tolerate cow's milk products by 1 or 2 years of age. The aim of the study was to investigate the rate of milk tolerance in infants who are under 12 months of age. Method: Twenty-seven infants were studied who presented bloody stools, due to allergic proctocolotis after birth and had a cow's milk challenge at a mean age of 6 AE 2.43 months. Twenty-four infants at a mean age of 17.7 AE 4.34 months who also presented allergic proctocolotis, after birth and were challenged after the first year of life served as controls. Statistical analysis: Fisher's Exact test was used to compare rates between patients and controls. Results: Three out of 27 patients had a positive cow's milk challenge and 1 out of 24 children among the controls had a positive challenge (P = 0.6123). Conclusion: Early cow's milk challenge caused a higher reaction rate of 11, 1% compared to the control rate of 4, 16% (not statistically significant results could be attributed to the low study sample).

The current approach includes strict avoidance and emergency treatment for accidental exposures. Parents and patients must be vigilant about food allergen avoidance in multiple settings. This burden and fear of accidental ingestion can lead to reduced health-related quality of life. The purpose of the study was to examine the quality of life in food allergic patients in Israel. Patients and methods: The population study includes patients registered in the 'Israel Foundation of Food Allergy' A validated separate questionnaires for children and adolescents were used. Questions were divided into three main groups: food anxiety, dietary limitations and emotional impact. Results: One-hundred and nineteen patients were included, 71 (60%) males. Average age 6.5 AE 2 years. Food anxiety score is significantly greater in children with more than one food allergy (P = 0.037). Dietary limitations (DL) is significantly greater in children with cow\u2032s milk allergy as compared to other food allergies (P = 0.036). Significantly greater food anxiety among sesame and peanut allergic patients (P = 0.029, 0.024, respectively). No difference in any of the scores by anaphylaxis. Dietary limitations score were significantly higher and emotional impact (EI) score marginally higher in children with asthma/bronchitis. (DL P = 0.031, EI P = 0.056) Conclusions: Food allergy clearly affects quality of life of patients and their families in Israel. The parameters that have the most significant impact include cow\u2032s milk allergy, allergy to more than 1 food, allergy to sesame or peanuts, but surprisingly not anaphylaxis. Background: Disposition towards severe allergic reactions to basic food is usually being treated by dietary measures although significantly diminishing the quality of life. Despite a diminished allergen exposure, patients will still remain at risk, however, if hidden traces of the culprit allergen are known to elicit symptoms. Case report: A 21-year old female patient presented with a history of anaphylactic reactions which had been associated with the consumption of milk, and which had occurred for the first time soon after birth. Subsequently, the patient's parents were instructed to strictly avoid milk products, and were provided with an emergency kit. In the following years, the patient occasionally experienced only mild symptoms when consuming an apparently milk-free diet within a family-based setting. Later on, the patients moved into a flat-sharing community and started a job training necessitating the consumption of workplace meals. Although the patient had explicitly informed all persons involved into meal production and serving, she repeatedly experienced minor to moderate allergic reactions (asthma).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Quality of life in food allergic patients in Israel"}, {"text": "Laboratory examinations revealed specific IgE-antibodies to milk protein, lactalbumin and casein (all CAP class 2); furthermore, we found positive prick test reactions to casein and cow milk solutions. Subsequently, we started a specific oral tolerance induction (SOTI) using long life milk at a dose of 100 ml (customary skimmed long life milk). During up-dosing, the patient repeatedly developed urticaria. Since pre-treatment by fexofenadine and omeprazole eventually caused an agonizing nausea and aversion, we reduced the daily milk dose to 50 ml. One and a half years later, we modified our therapy now switching to ultra-heat treated milk (ESL-milk). During this time, the patient no longer had problems when eating out. Half a year later, daily intake of milk doses became irregular during vacation. After returning home the patient complained about repeated throat and chest pain. Histological examination of mucosa biopsies taken endoscopically revealed an eosinophilic esophagitis (EO). This finding prompted us to terminate SOTI. Conclusion: EO is a rare disease. There is now solid evidence that food allergy may cause this inflammatory disorder. As demonstrated by our case, development of EO may also be a side effect of SOTI performed in patients with a history of anaphylaxis. Background: Omalizumab has been currently used in severe asthma and rarely in other allergic diseases. However data on its efficacy for food allergy is limited. In this case report we evaluated the effect of omalizumab on multiple food allergies in 12 years old boy. Case report: The patient was 12 years old boy with past history of asthma at 1 year, severe atopic dermatitis at 2 years, anaphylaxis due to wheat at 6 years, vernal conjunctivitis and multiple food allergies. Total IgE level was 3450 IU/ml. Skin prick test revealed reactions to house dust mites, grass pollens, tree pollens, milk, egg, wheat and peanut. He had high specific IgE levels for milk, egg, wheat, peanut, soy, carrot, orange, strawberry, banana, apple, potato, spinach, and garlic. Oral food challenge was found to be positive for milk, egg and wheat. He had been treated for asthma, atopic dermatitis, rhinitis and vernal conjunctivitis. His symptoms were not under control even with medical therapy and strict diet. He was put on omalizumab 150 mg every other week. After 3 months his symptoms were improved. Skin prick test was found to be negative for food allergens and food spIgE levels were decreased. Moreover, oral food challenges for milk, egg and wheat were found negative. Conclusion: In this case we showed that omalizumab had positive effects on both clinical symptoms and laboratory findings in patients with multiple food allergies. Further studies in larger series are needed. Background: Omalizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody has been currently used in the treatment of patients with severe or mild asthma, with a serum IgE ranging from 30 to 700 IU/ml, which are not controlled by normally performed drugs. Few observations suggest the use of omalizumab for patients with the food allergy. Method: In one of our patient, male, 36 years old, with severe attacks of IgEmediated was treated with Omalizumab. Before of treatment with monoclonal antibody the patient experienced severe attacks of IgE-mediated asthma with contact to peach associated to urticaria and angioedema. This patient was admitted to the emergency room several times during the last year; (2 times for Urticaria and Angioedema with following to anaphylaxis and to attack of severe asthma) with an asthma symptom score of 8 [scale from 0 (least) to 9 (severe)]. He had previous several episodes of oral allergy syndrome and contact urticaria. The total IgE concentra-tions were 342 IU/ml; specific IgE against Dermatophagoides Pteronyissinus (91 kU/ l), Dermatophagoides Farinae (79 kU/l), Perennial Rye Grass (rLol p1: 78 kU/l), Birch pollen, (rBet v1: 64 kU/l and rBet v2: 45 kU/l) and to allergen of Peach (Prunus p3:16 kU/l). Results: The patient was treated with Omalizumab every four weeks 0.016 mg/ kg/IU (IgE/ml). After 16 weeks of treatment with Omalizumab, the total IgE in the serum were 210 lU/ml. No visits to intensive care unit were necessary during the treatment and the asthma symptom score decreased to 3.The peak of expiratory flow (PEF) in the morning increased each four weeks with a stable value of 620 l/min (EU Scale). The patient tolerated a diet including peach fruit (300 g) and its corralates fruits (i.e.: pears, walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts, apples, apricots, plums, cherries, kiwi, carrots, potatoes, peppers, celery, fennel, parsley, parsnips and coriander). Conclusion: This study suggests a novel approach to the treatment patients with atopic asthma and Urticaria and Angioedema to peach fruit. Omalizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal anti-IgE antibody approved for treatment of moderate to severe IgE-mediated asthma, it could be useful also to treat IgE mediated Urticaria-Angioedema and as it may be also a reduction of risk to suffering a life-threatening reaction to other correlated foods. Background: Allergic reactivity to cow milk protein (CMP) could develop allergy no mediated by IgE, a process less known. That's why we had been evaluated the possible role of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and its subclasses in allergy to CMP and its possible role in tolerance induction in allergic patients. Method: A transversal study was done in 129 allergic patients and 29 healthy individuals among 0 and 45 years old. Patients with allergic rhinitis (AR), bronchial asthma (BA), atopic dermatitis (AD) and/ or immunodeficiency, who attended the consultation of allergy, among January to May 2012 were included. International criteria were applied during clinical trials. An automated ELISA instrument was used to determine specifics IgE, IgG and IgG4. A comparative study was done using McNemar method. Results: Among all allergic patients (76 women, 53 men), prevalence of BA was 24%, AR 36%, BA+AR 57%, BA+AD 23%, BA + Immunodeficiency + AR 20.9%; BA+ AD+ atopic march 11.3%; while the prevalence of BA+AR+AD+ atopic march was 18%. 61.2% of atopic patients showed high IgG levels against CMP and 29.5% of them showed high level of specific IgG4. There was significant differences with respect to healthy population (p\u02c20.05), 3.4% of them showed high IgG levels and none of them showed high IgG4 levels. Twenty-five percent of atopic patients high IgE and IgG levels, and a higher percentage showed high IgG levels and normal IgE levels (P = 0.003). Seven individuals showed high IgE and IgG4 levels and twice of them showed high IgG4 levels and normal IgE levels (P = 0.054). Conclusion: Sensitivity of 57.26% and specificity of 88.90% have been reported for IgG; while sensitivity and specificity for IgG4 was 20.20% and 100%, respectively.

Skin or inhalatory sensitisation has been described in cases of oat allergy. We present a case of anaphylaxis after ingestion of oat milk with no crossreaction with other cereals. Method: A seventy-year-old man with a history of essential hypertension and rheumatoid arthritis, presented 10 min after ingestion of 200 ml of oat milk, an episode of palmoplantar pruritus, generalised exanthema, nausea, vomits, thoracic and laryngeal oppression and systolic hypotension. The episode resolved after adrenaline, corticosteroids and antihistaminic treatment. The allergic study included: basal tryptase, blood count cell, biochemistry and coagulation; skin test with usual pneumoallergens, oat milk and oat seed; serum specific IgE determination (immunoCAP) to oat, barley, rye and grass pollen; IgE determination (EAST) to oat milk and oat seed, as well as to 102 allergens (immunocap ISAC) were performed; SDS-PAGE immunoblotting with extracts from oat milk and oat seed was carried out.

In our clinic we observed high prevalence of hazelnut allergy in children with grass pollen allergy. In this study we aimed to investigate the cross reactivity between hazelnut and grass pollen allergens among children with sensitivity to both hazelnut and grass pollen. Method: In this study 17 sera from patients suffering from pollinosis to grass and sensitisation to hazelnut were studied. Sensitivity of patients to hazelnut and grass pollen was determined by skin prick tests and sIgE (ImmunoCAP). Study group divided to 'hazelnut reactive' and 'hazelnut non reactive' according to DBPCFC tests. Hazelnut and grass pollen allergens (Phleum pratense) were identified by means of SDS-PAGE and IgE immunoblotting. Assessment of cross-reactivity with grass pollen allergens is shown by immunoblotting inhibition experiments. Results: A band smaller than 10 kD was found in the patients with (+) DBPCFC but not in patients with (\u00c0) DBPCFC. In the SDS-PAGE gel for Phleum pratense allergens\u033432kD band (presumably Phl p5b) was found as a major allergen. In SDS-PAGE gel by using serum pool of DBPCFC (\u00c0) and DBPCFC (+) groups, we determined bands between 50-60 kD (Group 4 and 13 grass pollen allergens), these bands were present only in DBPCFC (\u00c0) but not DBPCFC (+) group. As similar to grass pollen allergen gel, in the gel with hazelnut allergen extract we found bands between 40 50 kD in DBPCFC (\u00c0) group, but not in DBPCFC (+) group. Inhibition experiments showed that the bands between 40-50 kD, observed in DBPCFC (\u00c0) group, were inhibited by Phleum pratense allergenic extracts. More-over bands between 50-60 kD (Group 4 and 13 grass pollen allergens) observed in grass pollen gel of DBPCFC (\u00c0) group, inhibited by hazelnut allergenic extracts. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the band in hazelnut allergen gels smaller than 10 kD (presumably Cor a8) may be useful for discrimination of hazelnut reactive patients from non reactive ones and the specific IgE response in DBPCFC (\u00c0) group might be as a result of cross-reactivity between hazelnut allergens (40-50 kD) and grass pollen allergens (50-60 kD) by means of homolog antigen structure. Background & objectives: This study was conducted to identify the most common sensitising food and inhalant allergens in physician-diagnosed allergic children and adults in North India. Methods: Two-hundred and seventy four allergy-diagnosed patients aged 6-65 years were enrolled in the study. They were classified as atopics if had at least one positivity when screened with ImmunoCAP \u00e2 Phadiatop and fx5 (Food mix 5; 6 common foods), a technology considered as the gold standard for IgE antibody blood testing worldwide. For identification of the sensitising allergens atopic patients were further tested by ImmunoCAP \u00e2 Specific IgE using a broad panel of common Indian allergens covering 17 foods and 19 inhalants (singles/mixes). Results: Phadiatop/fx5 determined 59% (162/274) of the patients as atopic, whereof 159 were included for further evaluation. Thirty-six percent of the patients had the medical history of urticaria followed by atopic dermatitis (26%), asthma (23%) and rhinitis (23%). The commonest sensi-tising food allergen was banana (68%) followed by sesame seeds (66%), lemon (45%), rice (31%), wheat (24%), cashew (23%) and peanut (21%). Among inhalants, house dust mite, Dermatophagoides farinae (83%) was the most prevalent sensitising allergen followed by cockroach (79%), weed pollens (29-50%), tree pollen (16-29%), grass pollen mix (26%) and mold mix (25%). Interpretations and conclusions: Phadiatop/ fx5 results revealed that the physicians' diagnosis of IgE mediated allergy was accurate only in 59% of cases and thus showed the importance of using allergy tests in conjunction with clinical findings for a correct allergy diagnosis. This is the first Indian sensitisation data of this dignity analyzed by ImmunoCAP \u00e2 ; a WHO standardised allergy blood test. Besides high rates of mite and cockroach sensitisation, useful native information of other prevalent sensitising Indian allergens was collected that would improve cost effectiveness of the allergy treatment and increases the quality of life of patients with allergy in India. Background: The incidence of allergic diseases increased in recent years due to many reasons, including air and water pollutions, artificial food consumption, increasing traffic. Our laboratory receives samples nationwide from selected disciplines. Doctors send samples for IgE based in vitro tests besides in vivo testing their patients. The aim of this study was to analyze all material in order to get insight into factors determining prevalence of allergy in Hungary. Method: Serum samples (3178) sent in by laboratory network were analyzed according demand of the doctors. Five panels and 80 different nutritive and inhalant allergen specific IgE (sIgE) threshold positivity was Class 2, together with total IgE were measured by IMMULITE 2000 and Modular E respectively. Results: Out of all samples 1463 were directly linked to allergic diseases. These included allergic rhinitis 39%, asthma 19%, allergic urticaria 15%, atopic dermatitis 11%, allergic gastroenteritis 8%, and 'allergy' 8%. The remaining 1715 samples belonged to 24 different diagnostic categories out of which 9 (with 676 samples) could be related to allergy as well. About 1039 samples (15 diagnostic categories) were sent upon different acute conditions (879; 27.6%). The pediatric allergic cases could be divided into age categories 0-7.9; 8-14 years with 542 and 189 cases. The remaining 732 cases represented adults (>15 year) and were females 509 (69.5%) and males 223 (30.5%). Within the allergic group according to diagnosis at 95% sensitivity for total vs sIgE, the cutoff value was 30 kU/l; negative predictive value 96% (by ROC curve). Out of the total 1463 allergic samples 448 (30%) reacted at least one inhalant allergen. Similarly, 218 (15%) were positive to at least one nutritive allergen. Moreover, a mixed positive group could be generated with 28 out of 135 demands containing both inhalant and nutritive sensitivities. Conclusion: Among many unnecessary test, that represent over estimation of allergy or poor decision by the sender, the low cutoff value established for sIgE in relation to total IgE deserves attention. In our study Ragweed is the most common allergen in Hungary. Background: Skin prick testing is a practical method widely used in the diagnosis of allergic diseases. Repeated skin prick tests can be used to demonstrate the new sensitisations or natural sensitisation. The aim of this study is to investigate sensitisations to common enviromental antigens over time in children. Method: Sixty children who were followed up with diagnosis of allergic rhinits and/or asthma in Dokuz Eylul University Faculty of Medicine division of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology. Participants were the children who had skin testing second time during 2010. Skin prick test allergens involved grass, grass/cereal, weeds, tree pollens, fungi, animal hair and dander, olea, pinus, and house dust mite. Induration more than 3 mm at the side of the test was considered as positive response. In statistical analyses, categorical variables of dependent groups evaluated with chisquare test. Comparison of values between groups gathered from measurements were assessed with Mann-Whitney U test. Results: 60% of the patients were male and the mean age was 7.3 AE 3.7 and the average time elapsed between the two skin test was 2.2 AE 1.4 years. When the first skin test were compared to second skin test, grass sensitisation increased from 38.3% to 51.7% (P = 0.058), grass/cereal sensitisation increased from 38.3% to 51.7% (P = 0.059) and pinus increased from 1.7% to 8.3% (P = 0.046). While increase in sensitivity to grass and grass/ cereal mix was non significant, the increase in pinus sensitivity was statistically significant. Background: As a joint-venture of Dr. Fooke Laboratorien GmbH and the Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology of the Russian Academy of Sciences (EIMB) a prototype of a multiplex test-system for the simultaneous quantitative determination of 21 allergen-specific antibodies and total IgE was developed. The Biochips are manufactured using EIMB technology. The architecture of the chip is an array of hemispherical gel elements (microdrops 0.1 nl in volume), each containing an individual immobilised molecular probe. The main advantage of the three-dimensional hydrogel Biochip is a high immobilisation density, the absence of contact of protein molecules with the hydrophobic surface of the carrier and an aqueous environment of immobilised molecules prevents protein denaturation. Method: A set of purified allergen extracts which fulfill the requirements of manufacturing for the hydrogel-based Biochips were prepared for 21 very common allergens and total IgE and >300 serum samples of allergic patients and healthy donors were tested. The measurement and calculation of the signals was performed using ImaGelResearch software (developed in EIMB).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 44, "end": 48, "text": "1616", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6313, "end": 6318, "text": "(15%)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Poster Session 72"}, {"text": "We compared the results produced with the novel AllergoChip with established assay methods like ALLERG-O-LIQ (DFL) and ImmunoCAP (Thermo Fisher).

Conclusion: The frequency of serum IgE-aB to cat's allergens among patients with allergic rhinitis and bronchial asthma in residents of two capitals Moscow and Yekaterinburg is highup to in children andup to in adults. The majority of sensitised to cat pts (89%) are reactive for rFel d 1. [2005] [2006] [2007] in Clinic of Pediatric Immunology and Allergy, were repeated after an interval of at least 3 years. Skin-prick tests with the same allergens were repeated in all patients. Pulmonary function tests, immunoglobulin E and peripheral blood eosinophil levels were evaluated. Results: The mean age was 10.7 AE 3.1 (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) years and 70% of the patients were male. In the present skin tests 95 (55.9%) cases had skin reactivity to at least one allergen, while 89 (52.4%) patients had skin prick-test reactivity in first skin test. In the comparison of sensitivities of the two test, there was a statistically significant alteration for grass pollen mixture, cereal pollen mixture and dog epithelium sensitivity (P = 0.01, P = 0.08, P = 0.00). 14 (17%) with non sensitivity in the first tests showed changes in sensitivity while the change of sensitivity had in 52 (58%) patients with sensitivity in the first tests. In total, 66 (39.0% of the study population) had a different skin tests result at follow up compared with first. Alterations: loss of sensitivity in 18 (11%) patients, the formation of a new sensitivity in 37 (22%) patients, and 11 (6%) both gained and lost sensitisations.

The presence of sensitisation of multipl allergen (Odds ratio = 7.97; 95% confidence interval = 1.6 to 54.6, P = 0.035) significantly predicted incidence of loss of sensitisation. Conclusion: It is found that there was an alteration of sensitisation in 4/10 children at the end of the average 4-year period. These alterations have been mostly in the form of new sensitisation. The presence of family history, the presence of allergic rhinitis and IgE elevation were the risk factors for development of new sensitisation besides sensitisation of multipl allergen were the risk factors for loss of sensitisation. Background: Patients suffering from mastocytosis are at risk of anaphylactic reactions which occur in 50% of patients with systemic and 15% of patients with cutaneus disease. There are no in vitro methods available which could be used to predict the risk of the reaction so far. The aim of the study was to analyze the cytokines levels in the serum which could indicate patients at risk of anaphylactic reaction. Method: Eighty-five patients suffering from systemic mastocytosis and 20 controls were included in the study. Among the mastocytosis patients 54 (63%) declared anaphylactic reaction in the medical history, while 31 (37%) did not suffer from such reaction so far. Cytokine levels (GM-CSF, IL-13, IL 1 beta, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, RANTES, TNF-alfa, VEGF, bFGF) were measured in the serum of the patients using flow cytometry and microbead flex set.

A food allergy is often the first manifestation of allergy in childhood, predisposing to further development of respiratory allergy so the importance of early diagnosis to implement preventive measures. The determination of sensitisation to food and respiratory allergens may prevent future allergic diseases. The objective was evaluate the behavior of the frequency of foods and respiratory allergens sensitisation in patients referred to Corpodiagnostica Laboratory (Caracas, Venezuela, ISO 9001:2008 certified laboratory) in the period 2010-2012. Method: There were a total of 6600 patients with a request of specific IgE against some foods and aero-allergens. We measured the specific IgE to each patient by the in vitro RIDA \u00e2 Allergy-screen immunoblot method (r-biopharm \u00e2 , Germany). Results: The frequency of sensitisation to aero-allergens were 41.48% in 2010, 62.18% in 2011 and 63.17% in 2012, being most frequent dust mites. In the case of food allergens the frequency of sensitisation were 25.99% in 2010, 45.41% in 2011 and 44.93% in 2012. Cow milk is the most common food allergen in the children group in each period evaluated. Conclusion: In Venezuela has been increasing the total sensitisation rate for the aero and food allergens during the 3 years we examined. These frequencies of aero-allergens are consistent with others studies that suggest that climate change and exposure rate may contribute to increasing development of respiratory allergy. On the other hand, the increasing obtained for the frequency of sensitisation to food allergens could be relate with the introducing of cow milk, cheese, wheat, egg white and corn in the early diet of Venezuelan children; in fact these kind of allergens are the most frequency food in the Venezuelan diet.

Method: A 38 year old man, with subclinical hypothyroidism and slight pollen rhinitis on January and May-June, refers sneezing, rhinoconjunctivitis and urticaria on contact with roe deer, for the last 2 years. He has contact with this animal 3 days a week from April to July and in September-October. We performed functional lung test, skin prick test (SPT) and immunological studies to disclose the relationship between exposure to this animal, sensitisation and symptoms. Results: Baseline spirometry revealed a FEV 1 of 4.870 mmL (100% predicted), that was normal. We performed a bronchial challenge (BC) with methacholine, without any kind of bronchial response. FE NO was of 33 ppb, and the nasal nitric oxide determination was of 3175 ppb. SPT to a standard panel of inhalants was positive to grass, olive and Cupressus but negative to other pollens, dust mites, fungus and dog-cat dander, confirming the cause of his pollen rhinitis. Also we did SPT to some epithelia allergens, that was positive to horse and goat, doubtful to cow and sheep, and negative to others (rabbit, mouse, cat, dog, hamster, goose, mixture of feather, \u2026). We made an extract with the patient\u2032s roe deer hair and dander and when tested in prick test a weal of 15 mm was obtained (positive control wih histamine test a weal of 5 mm, and negative control with saline was negative). We performed a nasal provocation test with this extract on different concentrations, and we obtain a positive result with the first one (less concentrated one): the patient began with runny, sneezing and falled of peak inspiratory flow rate nasal. The immunoblot revealed IgE in the patient\u2032s serum that bound to a protein around 19 kDa and another around 22 kDa. Conclusion: This study confirms than roe deer can act as an allergen on hunters, with an IgE mediated reponse. Background: Bird-egg syndrome is a known cross-reactive syndrome firstly described in 1985. We present a case report of a 55-year-old woman referred to our outpatient clinic because since six years ago she suffered sneezing, nasal blockage and nasal pruritus with conjunctival erythema and ocular pruritus. She also suffered since two years ago dyspnoea, cough and wheezing episodes that need budesonida, salmeterol, montelukast and salbutamol inhaled treatment with oral corticoids each month.. Moreover she complained of lingual pruritus immediately after eating hen's egg that last for an hour. She had a cockatoo at her home. Method: We performed skin prick test with canary, duck and parakeet feather and excrement, complete hen's egg, egg yolk, egg white, ovoalbumin, ovomucoid and lysozyme Alk-Abello extracts. We also performed espirometry after and before bronchodilator. Results: Skin prick tests were positive to canary, duck and parakeet feather, complete hen's egg, egg yolk, egg white and ovomucoide. It was negative to the rest of allergens tested. Bronchodilation test was positive. Conclusion: We present a case report of a bird-egg syndrome with rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma and oral allergy syndrome. This case underlines the importance of ask about food allergy in asthma suspected patients and on the other hand, exposure to cross-reacting antigens by ingestion might also influence the allergic manifestations to inhalant allergens. Background: Immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated immune responses seem to be directed against parasites and neoplasma, but are best known for their involvement in allergies. However, after having been widely used in clinical practice, the limit of evaluating total IgEs levels in the diagnosis of allergic disease has emerged. In fact, the determination of reference values is difficult due to problems in defining possible overlaps of IgE values between atopic and non atopic patients and the multiplicity of factors influencing their levels. The aim of the study was to characterise allergy patterns and the relationship between total serum IgEs and medical history in young patients. Method: We enrolled 266 patients: 188 presented with allergic rhinitis or asthma, 86 with cutaneous symptoms and 12 with food allergy. The patients were then stratified into four age groups at baseline (0-2, 3-5, 6-10 and >10 years). Total IgEs were measured by fluoroenzymeimmuno-assay and expressed in kU/l. Descriptive statistics were calculated and reported as medians (md). Comparison of variables was performed by the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. A P-value \u22640.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: Out of 258 patients, 145 (54.5%) showed an increased total IgE level. Total serum IgE levels were significantly higher (P < 0.0001) across age groups with the highest levels in the >10 year group (0-2 yearsmd: 22.5 kU/l, 3-5 yearsmd: 64.55 kU/l, 6-10 yearsmd: 142 kU/l and >10 yearsmd: 164 kU/l). If we consider the patients showing IgE levels over the range by age, the highest median value was in the 6-10 years group. Patients with allergic rhinitis or asthma showed a significant (P value < 0.0001) increase of IgE levels until 5 years of age, while the total value tends to decrease with age. The same findings were highlighted in patients with cutaneous symptoms. Total IgE values showed an increase through age in the food allergy group. Conclusion: Total serum IgE levels seem to be helpful to diagnose a predisposition to allergy in children. The clinical utility of total serum IgE measurements in the diagnosis of allergic disease has always been limited by its age dependent concentration and the wide overlap in concentrations in serum between atopic and non-atopic populations. Our preliminary results require further confirmation in larger cohorts and a study of correlation between total IgE levels and clinical severity of disease. Background: Type I hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by specific IgE to proteins, polysaccharides or glycoproteins. Saccharose or fructose intolerances and malabsortions are usually due to enzymatic deficiencies and manifest with gastrointestinal symptoms. Case presentation: A 52-year-old male patient was admitted to our department to study the occurrence of several episodes of systemic muco-cutaneous reactions (urticaria, angioedema and pharyngeal constriction) soon after ingestion of foods/drinks with a high content of rapid absortion sugars. He also had previous episodes of anaphylaxis 5 min after hymenoptera sting, and describes long-lasting asthma symptoms during the spring pollen season, both conditions without convenient medical diagnosis and treatment.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Urticaria and rhinoconjunctivitis in a hunter"}, {"text": "The study was conducted after more than month in complete absence of symptoms.

Conclusion: The absence of sensitisation to CCD argues against the eventual association of these atypical clinical symptoms to the hymenoptera sting allergy. The mechanisms involved in this presumably IgEmediate reaction to simple sugars require further studies. Case presentation: The authors present a case of a 27-year old patient, who developed severe erythemato-vesicular reaction 24 h after cesarean section. Within the time period of 48 h we could observe progression towards erythema multiforme-type of skin lesions (histopathological examination revealed erythema multiforme of a dermal type). Skin lesions were localised on the abdomen and thighs. Due to the severity of the reaction methyloprednizolone in pulse therapy, together with cyclosporine A (350-400 mg per day) were administered. A slow, systematic alleviation of symptoms was achieved. Pemphigoid gestationis was excluded on the basis of an immunopathological examination. Three months after the remission, the patient was hospitalised again to perform the diagnostics toward hypersensitivity reaction against disinfectants and textiles used during surgical procedure. Background: The incidence of nasal polyposis asthma increases probably because eosinophilic inflammation which characterises these diseases. Surgery is indicated when medical treatment is not effective, but does not prevent recurrences. Omalizumab is a monoclonal antibody antiimmunoglobulin E used to reduce the severity of bronchial asthma. Method: A 67 year-old female, with severe asthma, admissions in the intensive care unit, NSAID intolerance, sensitised to mites and dog epithelium. Nasal poliposis history for over 10 years. In four years has been surgically intervened three times by the recurrence of polyps despite repeated topical steroids and oral steroid cycles. Omalizumab treatment begins with 300 mg/month in February 2009. Results: After Omalizumab therapy is appreciated progressive improvement of nasal symptoms and lower respiratory tract, without emergency visits or need for oral corticosteroids, smell gradually recovers, and is results in a reduction of the dose of inhaled corticosteroid nasal and bronchial. During treatment showed no relevant changes in the blood count, biochemistry, skin tests, total and specific IgE, tryptase, immunoglobulins, and complement. ECP values decreased from 32.8 to 18.2 lg/l. The FEV1 improved from 68.5% to 89% of the theorist. After the last surgical cleansing, in rhinoscopy not been shown the reappearance of nasal polyposis. Marked decrease is seen naso-sinus polyps in radiological images. Conclusion: In our patient with anti-IgE therapy Omalizumab improved asthma, as has been described in the literature and suggested also be very effective in the control of the recurrence of polyposis, which may have therapeutic utility in this disease. Background: Acute rhinosinusitis is one of the most common upper respiratory tract diseases. In Germany, treatment of the disease with the herbal substance BNO-101 (Sinupret forte tablets) is very common. This non-interventional trial aimed to compare the treatment with BNO-101 and with the nasal spray SNS01 which contains the natural osmolyte ectoine. In contrast to most pharmaceutical treatments, ectoine is not metabolised but acts rather by stabilisation and moisturisation of cell membranes. Method: Patients diagnosed with acute rhinosinusitis in a specialist clinic were asked to participate in this non-interventional trial. Based on their personal preference, they were either treated with SNS01 or BNO-101 for 14-16 days. Treatment was applied in accordance with the instructions for use. Symptoms during the course of the study were evaluated by nasal endoscopy by ENT (ear nose throat) experts. Additionally, both physicians and patients scored the predominant disease symptoms using a rating system based on EPOS recommendations. A disease-specific quality of life questionnaire was used to document the impact of symptom improvement on daily life. Statistical analyses were carried out with SPSS 20; significance levels were set to 5% for all tests. Results: Following two weeks of treatments, endoscopy results reflected a comparable symptom decrease of 57.8% (P < 0.001) in the SNS01 group and of 49.3% (P = 0.004) in the BNO-101 group. In line with this, Sinusitis Symptom scores decreased similarly by 58.1% in the SNS01 group and by 53.5% in the BNO-101 group (P < 0.001 for both groups). Quality of life in patients treated with SNS01 improved by 15.81 points, and in patients receiving BNO-101 by 18.32 points (P < 0.001 and P = 0.033). Local tolerability of the nasal spray was judged very well by the patients. At the end of the treatment, both physicians and patients rated the efficacy of both products as good without differences in treatments. Tolerability of SNS01 was regarded as good to very good with comparable scores, and only one adverse event occurred during the course of the study. Conclusion: Treatment of acute rhinosinusitis with the nasal spray SNS01 showed equivalent efficacy as treatment with the herbal substance BNO-101. As SNS01 was also well tolerated and showed a very good safety profile, it might present a promising new treatment strategy for acute rhinosinusitis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Urticaria and rhinoconjunctivitis in a hunter"}, {"text": "Protective efficacy of pranlukast dry syrup, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, against Japanese cedar pollinosis in children Hosoya, K 1 ; Okubo, K 1 ; Hashiguchi, K 2 ; Masuno, S 3 1 Nippon Medical School, Otorhinolaryngology, Tokyo, Japan; 2 Futaba Clinic, Otorhinolaryngology, Tokyo, Japan; 3 Nippon Medical School Tama Nagayama Hospital, Otorhinolaryngology, Tokyo, Japan Background: We have reported the efficacy and safety of pranlukast dry syrup (PLK-DS), a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA), in children from 10 to 15 years old with Japanese cedar (JC) pollinosis by the double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study used an artificial exposure chamber (OHIO Chamber) 1) . It is ideal that the treatment of pollinosis can be started as early as possible to alleviate symptoms. We examined whether PLK-DS have a protective efficacy against the priming state, the artificial pollen-exposure and the natural pollen-exposure of JC pollens by the double-blind, placebo-controlled, comparative study, in which medication was started on the date of pollen-observation before the defined start date of pollen dispersal. Method: Thirty children with JC pollinosis who had positive skin tests for JC pollens, had suffered from pollinosis for at least two years, and had severe nasal blockage when exposed to JC pollens were enrolled in the double-blind, placebo-controlled, comparative study. Over 8 weeks, a double-blind study was conducted by randomly allocating the children to two groups (the placebo group and the PLK-DS group). PLK-DS or placebo was administered orally after breakfast and dinner for 8 weeks in the season of JC pollen dispersal. Before the defined start date of pollen dispersal, all subjects underwent the exposure of 3 h to a specific amount of JC pollens (8000/m 3 ) in the OHIO Chamber. The efficacy of PLK-DS was evaluated based on nasal symptoms (sneezing, rhinorrhea, or nasal blockage), and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP). Results: In the PLK-DS group, scores for symptoms of pollinosis were lower compared to the placebo group in the medication period of the priming state, the artificial pollen-exposure and the natural pollen-exposure of JC pollens. Especially PLK-DS significantly improved the score for nasal blockage, compared to the placebo. Furthermore, the correlation was confirmed in change between scores for symptoms of pollinosis and ECP. Conclusion: Our results confirm a protective efficacy of PLK-DS against the priming state, the artificial pollen-exposure and the natural pollen-exposure of JC pollens. We conclude that PLK-DS, a LTRA, is a more effective drug as primal therapy when administered as early as possible in the season of JC pollens. Background: Rebamipide, a gastroprotective drug, has been prescribed for the treatment of gastritis and gastric ulcers because it suppresses gastric mucosal inflammation and increases gastric mucus production. In Japan, rebamipide eye drops have been approved for the treatment of dry eye disease. We previously reported that rebamipide can suppress polyI:C-induced cytokine production in human conjunctival epithelial cells and that the topical administration of rebamipide suppresses conjunctival allergic eosinophil infiltration in a murine experimental allergic conjunctivitis model. It has also been reported that dry eye with only decreased tear break-up time is sometimes found in allergic conjunctivitis patients. In this study, we examined the effect of rebamipide eye drops for allergic conjunctivitis with giant papilla. Methods: This study involved 5 allergic conjunctivitis patients with giant papilla (vernal conjunctivitis or atopic keratocon-junctivitis) accompanied by dry eye with decreased tear break-up time. In this study, rebamipide eye drops were prescribed for the treatment of dry eye in the 5 allergic conjunctivitis patients with giant papilla, and the alterations of their giant papilla were then observed. This study protocol was approved by the Ethical Review Board of Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine. Results: For all five patients, a 3-4 times daily administration of rebamipide eye drops was prescribed, and attenuation of the giant papilla was observed in all of the 5 patients.

The symptoms of dry eye may be similar to eye allergy: redness of the eyes, burning or itching in the eyes, blurred vision, sensation of foreign body, tired eyes. Method: Prospective study on a group of 30 patients with dry eye syndrome, during one year. Inclusion criteria: signs of eye dryness, lamp examination revealed conjunctival folds, Schirmer test pozitiv and / or test But low, ocular allergy symptoms: itching, red eyes; symptoms and signs of other allergic diseases: rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, asthma; positive specific IgE or skin prick tests. Exclusion criteria: patients with dry eye syndrome who respond well to the use of artificial tears, negative specific IgE or skin prick tests. Results: Of the 30 patients, 23 (76.6%) had IgE-mediated sensitisation.

Background: Hyaluronic acid is a component of extracellular matrix that is considered as a regulator of inflammatory responses and tissue damage. Non-Allergic Rhinitis (NAR) is a non-IgE-mediated group of disorders that are characterised by nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and/or postnasal discharge and by distinct inflammatory cell infiltrate: NAR infiltrated by eosinophils (NARES), by mast cells (NARMA), by neutrophils (NARNE) and by eosinophils and mast cells (NAR-ESMA). The aim of this study is to evaluate the cytological characteristics of nasal tissue in patients with NAR before and after treatment with an isotonic solution of hyaluronic acid and seawater. Method: Ten patients with non allergic rhinitis were enrolled. NAR was defined on the basis of the allergological exam (prick test for common aeroallergen and IgEs negative). All the patient underwent nasal cytology. Nasal cytology was performed by scraping the middle one-third of inferior turbinates with Rhinoprobes. Samples were fixed by air drying and stained with Wright-Giemsa stain and were examined under an optical microscope. Five patients were randomly treated with an isotonic solution of hyaluronic acid and seawater (group A) and Five patients without therapy (group B) for 60 days. Nasal cytology was repeated after 60 days. Results: In the group A at time 0 different immunological inflammatory patterns were detected: 2 cases of metaplasia mucipara, 1 of NARMA, 1 of NARES and 1 of NAR-NE, after treatment with the isotonic solution of hyaluronic acid and seawater we observed a significant decrease of globet cells in the two patients with metaplasia mucipara; in 1 case of NARMA any mast cell was detected after the treatment. In 1 case of NARES and 1 of NARNA any cytological modification was observed. In the group B at time 0 were 3 cases of NARES, 1 of NARMA and 1 normal. Any difference was detected in the group B after 60 days. Conclusion: The treatment with the isotonic solution of hyaluronic acid and seawater led to an improvement of the cytological features of the rhinitis, that appeared more clear due to the reduction of the globet cells. The treatment seems to be more effective in rhinitis with globet cells metaplasia. Previous observations with these findings confirm the role of hyaluronic acid in the regulation of the nasal inflammatory responses and his role in the repairing of nasal epithelium. Background: To characterise cytokineexpression in hyperplastic and polypoid nasal tissue (NT) after application of antihistamines and topical steroids through the establishment of an ex-vivo short-time-tissue-culture of faultless functional NT via oxygenation with ambient air. Methods: Intraoperatively assessed NT was divided in pieces of approximately 2 mm\u00b3 and subsequently oxygenated in culture medium up to 48 h at 37\u00b0C through insufflating of air blisters. After stimulation with Lipopolysaccharide and Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), the released cytokines Il-5, Il-8 and MCP-1 from tissue were verified via ELISA in incubation medium as well as their modifications through addition of cromoglycic acid, levocabastine, rupatadine, budesonide, fluticasone and mometasone furoate. Results: Compared to conventionel tissueculture in dishes, an up to 4.3 times higher expression of cytokines in course of time could be detected. Secretion of IL-8-and MCP-1 in hyperplastic NT was less suppressed through cromoglycic acid, levocabastine, budesonide and fluticasone furoate than through mometasone (P < 0.01) und rupatadine (P < 0.01). Cytokine-secretion in polypoid NT was up to 4 times higher and mostly suppressed through rupatadine (P < 0.01) followed by mometasone (P < 0.01). Conclusion: The presented ex-vivo shorttime-tissue-culture of NT with oxygenation represents an easy to use sensitive assay for further examination and characterisation of (patho-) physiological procedures after different stimulations and applications of agents respectively.

Many manufacturers recommend interrupting subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) for a total of 3 weeks in case of vaccination. Method: A total of 1364 persons (approximately 23% children/adolescents up to 18 years of age) receiving SCIT and/or vaccination in a German ENT-practice between 2007 and 2012 were included and analyzed retrospectively. About 766 patients had received vaccination (e.g. influenza, pneumococcus, tetanus/diphtheria, hepatitis, TBE, MMR), 431 patients with severe allergic disease received only SCIT while 151 patients had received vaccination and SCIT injections simultaneously on one day in different locations. Additionally, 16 patients inadvertently received SCIT injections within up to 4 days after vaccination because they had not informed the doctor about their previous injections. Allergoids as well as native allergen extracts were used for SCIT, predominantly in a perennial application mode. Some of the patients were observed for consecutive years receiving several vaccinations during SCIT. Adverse drug reactions (ADR) were evaluated according to the World Allergy Organization (WAO) grading system (WAO-grading). This survey was neither initiated nor sponsored by industry. Results: Patients exclusively receiving vaccinations did not report any drug-related ADR. One ADR third grade and two second grade occurred in 3 asthmatic patients exclusively receiving SCIT. None of these patients were admitted to hospital and all recovered in the physician's rooms within 2 h. The 151 patients simultaneously receiving vaccination and SCIT did not have any ADR. This was also the case for a subgroup of 36 of them who consecutively received SCIT and vaccination for up to 5 years. Furthermore, there was no reported ADR in patients receiving inadvertent SCIT within 4 days of vaccination. Conclusion: The international guidelines for SIT recommend an intermission of at least one week between SCIT and the administration of vaccines, however our findings demonstrate the possibility to shorten or abolish this interval without increasing the risk of ADR. It should be further clarified how similar the immunological mechanisms of 'allergen vaccination' (SCIT) and vaccination against pathogens are.

Background: The prevalence of allergic asthma and rhinitis is increasing worldwide. It is a growing medical, social and economic problem. The therapeutic management of allergy currently involves: allergen avoidance, symptomatic medication and specific immunotherapy. Only specific immunotherapy targets the underlying disease. Traditionally, immunotherapy has been administered subcutaneously. The development of immunotherapy as sublingual drops has provided a safer and more convenient alternative to the subcutaneous route. Method: Sixty patients suffering from grass pollen, house dust mites-induced rhinoconjunctivitis with or without asthma underwent specific immunotherapy with appropriate standardised allergen extract (Sevapharma, Czechrepublic) administered sublingually for two years. The diagnosis of respiratory allergy was made by clinical history, positive skin prick test to standardised pollen, house dust mites extract and the presence of specific IgE to the mixture of grass pollens, mites with class 3 as minimum value. Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) involved a build-up or induction or updosing phase and maintenance phase with the maximum dose (10000 JSK, PNU; 10 drops 3 times in the week). Efficiency was estimated clinically (very good/good/ moderate/poor/no effect) and laboratory (specific IgE and IgG4) to and in 2 years of treatment. Serum specific IgE were detected by immunoblots (R-Biopharm, Germany. Specific IgG4 levels were measured by ELISA DR FOOKE). Results: It was found that SLIT is effective according to subjective clinical parameters and drug consumption, with a highly significant reduction of symptoms and drug intake favoring sublingual administration where a reduction of more than 80% was achieved. After 2 years of SLIT of specific serum IgE to the respiratory allergens of grass pollens, house dust mites level was significantly decreased. Levels of specific IgG4 to the allergens of grass pollens, house dust mites showed increase (p 0.001). Adults with rhinitis only have lower specific IgE and IgG4 than adults with both rhinitis and asthma (P 0.05). Laboratory results corresponded to the clinical improvement. Adverse effects were limited to a small number of mild local reactions.

Background: We have evaluated the influence of specific immunotherapy (SIT) on the clinical symptoms and inflammatory response in patients with allergic (grass pollen induced) rhino-conjunctivitis. Method: Twenty-six patients (age range 18-44 years) with positive history for more than 2 years and skin-prick test \u22655 mm underwent conjunctival provocation tests before and after 1 year of SIT. Clinical severity of nasal and conjunctival symptoms during the season was assessed by 4point arbitrary rating scale from 0 to 3. Conjunctival provocation were done out of the season until allergic symptoms occurred achieving the allergen threshold dose (ATD). Results: After 1 year of SIT we found reduction in clinical symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis (burning, itching, lacrimation and hyperemia) P < 0.05 as well as reduction in clinical symptoms of allergic rhinitis (secretion, irritation, itching and nasal blockade) P < 0.01. Significantly higher allergen doses in provocation test (out of season) were tolerated after 1 year of performed SIT, reaching new ATD. Conclusion: Grass pollen SIT reduces clinical symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and modifies the inflammatory response after specific allergen challenge.

Summary background: There has been a confirmed efficacy in reducing asthma symptoms and use of medications in 42 clinical trials of immunotherapy with mites; studies in Latin America are still insufficient. Objective: Check the efficacy of subcutaneous immunotherapy with mites in bronchial asthma in four countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Materials and methods: A Phase IV multicenter clinical trial in asthmatic patients from Venezuela, Cuba, Ecuador, and Mexico. The study included November 2010 to October 2012. The sample consisted of 40 patients from each of the services with intermittent asthma and mild to moderate persistent associated with allergic sensitisation to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farina, and B. tropicalis. Mono-sensitised and polysensitised patients of both sexes ranging from 18 to 60 years of age were included. Randomised double-blind groups were formed with immunotherapy (IG) and placebo (PG). The IG received Depot vaccines from Diater laboratories, the PG received a diluent. The plan used was four standardised PNU / cc bottles were applied in ascending order (10, 100, 1000 and 10 000), beginning with the 10 PNU / cc bottle. Five weekly subcutaneous injections (0.10, 0.20, 0.30, 0.40 and 0.50 cc) were applied. Once the five weekly increases were completed, the fourth subcutaneous injection 0.50 cc was left as a maintenance dose every 30 days. Efficacy was evaluated in the first week and at 12 months. Efficacy endpoints included reduction in the frequency and severity of asthma symptoms (RFSS), drug consumption behavior (CCM), evidence of reduced sensitivity to the allergen (PRHA), and quality of life questionnaire (AQLQ). Results: The frequency of asthma symptoms was 0.5 before the study in both groups, and at 12 months of 0.1 and 0.3 in the IG and PG respectively. Severity in the IG was 2.1 before and 0.7 after the study, the PG 2.2 and 1.9 respectively. The CCM in both groups was 94.3% before the study and after the study 28.8% in IG and 63.7% in PG. Mean PRHA was lower (3.1 mm) in IG than in the PG (4.2 mm) at 12 months. The quality of life of living increased in the IG from 4.1 to 6.4 score and 4.2 to 5.1 in the PG. Conclusion: Immunotherapy with Depot vaccines is effective in the treatment of bronchial asthma. Background: Little data exists on allergen immunotherapy (AIT) in patients with cancer in remission (CaREM) or cancer in stable stage, but still under treatment (CaTx). In this context the experience of practicing allergists might yield very useful information. Methods: A survey (Surveymonkey \u00e2 ) was sent out to all AAAAI members in and outside US to explore their experience with AIT in patients with specific medical conditions. We defined minor problems as 'some dose-reduction or doses postponed, but no major problems'. AIT could be continued' and major problems as 'activation of underlying disease and/or AIT not well tolerated (systemic adverse events) and/or AIT discontinued for medical reasons'. Results are expressed descriptively. Results: 1061 of the 5148 (20.6%) surveys were sent back. Practice characteristics: 86-14% US-outsideUS, 44% urban, 51% suburban and 5% rural with a third of all responders working in an academic setting. Fifty-four percent of the surveyed had clinical experience of more than 16 years with an even distribution over small/ middle/ large practices. 671/963 (69%) responding experts have experience with AIT in CaREM patients, 25% have no experience but would treat, while 7% considers CaREM a contraindication. 146/681 (21%) report experience with >10 patients in their clinics, summing a total of over 2400 CaREM patients treated by all respondents together. Ninety one percent of responding allergists found no special problems, 8% minor and 0.6% major problems (2 from Europe, 1 from LA; Ca of GI tract/kidney). Three-hundred and sixteen allergists gave AIT to breast CaREM patients without major problems, 115 prostate, 77 colon, 70 lymphoma and 60 skin. 346/976 (36%) responding experts have experience with AIT in CaTx patients, 32% have no experience but would treat, while 33% considers CaTx a contraindication. 33/680 (5%) report experience with >10 patients in their clinics, summing a total of over 700 CaTx patients treated.

The aim of this study is to present a 5-7 year follow up of continuous omalizumab treatment in three patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM). Method: Three adult patients (2 males, 1 female, aged 45, 48 and 44, respectively) with life threatening venom-induced anaphylaxis were studied. Bee venom sensitisation (positive skin tests and RAST/CAP) was confirmed in the first male and vespid in the female patient; the second male with three of unprovoked and three bee venom induced life-threatening anaphylaxis episodes was found to be IgE negative for venom allergy. On further workup, which included bone marrow biopsies and genetic studies too, they fulfilled the WHO criteria for ISM. A trial of VIT in the first two patients failed because of systemic reactions. All three patients consented to omalizumab treatment (+VIT in the 2 patients); 300 mg has been administered at monthly intervals through today (the first 2-year follow up has already been published). Results: Patients have been free of anaphylaxis (spontaneous or VIT induced) and have tolerated omalizumab without any adverse effect. A stage I renal cell carcinoma was diagnosed post-nephrectomy in the IgE negative patient at 2.5 years of omalizumab treatment; general anaesthesia was well tolerated despite his previous history of three unprovoked anaphylaxis-episodes. Patient remains free of any recurrence 2.5 years post-nephrectomy. All three have been repeatedly stung by the offending insects (H.bee, Vespids) without reactions. Routine laboratory evaluation is within normal limits; serum tryptase (Im-munoCAP) remains lower than the preomalizumab values and has normalised (<15 lg/l) in the longest treated patient (7 years). Conclusion: Long term (5-7 years) omalizumab treatment in patients with systemic mastocytosis and venom-induced anaphylaxiswith or without demonstrable specific IgEappears to be a well tolerated and efficacious treatment. Background: Antitumor cellular immune response in patients with breast cancer is impaired. Dendritic cell function and tumor antigen presentation to CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets are very important in the disease course and prognosis. This study assesses anti-tumor immune response in patients during dendritic cell (DC) based adjuvant immunotherapy. Method: Since 2010 there were 43 patients included in the trials, 19 patients in the main group (treated with DC) and 24 patients in the control (C) group. DC were obtained from peripheral blood monocytes, primed with four p53 peptides and injected into the patient sub-cutaneously three times. T-regs and antigen-specific T-cell (ASC) count was evaluated before and 6 months after the therapy in 14 patients from the main group and 12 patients from the C. Results: The median number of ASC was 0.29 (0.06-0.77)% in the DC treated group and 0.53 (0.14-0.89)% in the C (P = 0.28). The increase of ASC was seen in 80.0 AE 12.6% of patients after the DC immunotherapy. After the treatment the number of ASC increased in the DC treated group up to 0.81 (0.38-1.47)% (P = 0.001), while in the C there was no significant difference before and after treatment (P = 0.21). The level of T-regs before the treatment was 4.7 (2.9-6.7)% in patients from DC treated group and 3.6 (1.7-4.6)% in the C (P = 0.06). During course of DC immunotherapy T-regs in these patients were decreased in 71.4.0 AE 12.1% (P = 0.006) and only in 25.0 AE 12.5% of the C (P = 0.2). The ratio of ASC/T-regs in patients from the DC treated group was 0.04 (0.01-0.06)% before and 0.23 (0.19-0.43)% after the DC treatment (P = 0.001). However in the C group ASC/T-regs ratio did not change significantly during treatment period being 0.06 (0.01-0.32)% and 0.02 (0.00-0.21)% (P = 0.67). Conclusion: Elevated numbers of T-regs in cancer patients correlate with worse survival while a decrease of T-regs with treatment is a good prognostic factor. These results indicate the restoration of antitumor immune response in the patients with breast cancer due to treatment with the dendritic cellsvacine. Background: Infliximab is a chimeric anti-TNFa monoclonal antibody useful in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. The Acute Infusion Reactions (AIRs) reported at its administration, represent a treatment impediment, compelling alternative, usually less efficient therapeutic choices. The aim of our study was to provide data on the efficacy and safety of readministrating infliximab to a well selected population by applying a standardised Rapid Desensitisation (RD) protocol. Method: Patients (pts) selected for RD fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: (i) AIR clinically consistent with immediate hypersensitivity reaction, during or within 1 h after a slow-rate (\u22652 h) infliximab infusion, (ii) documented moderate or severe systemic (Brown grading system for hypersensitivity reactions) AIR and/or C)positive in vivo Skin-Prick or Intradermal testing in non-irritant infliximab concentrations. The RD protocol involved three solutions (each 250 ml) delivered in 12-consecutive steps, each step increasing the rate of infliximab administration by 2-to 2.5-fold. Solution 1 was a 100fold dilution of the final target concentration (steps 1-4), solution 2 a 10-fold dilution (steps 5-8) and the concentration of solution 3 (steps 9-12) was calculated by subtracting the cumulative dose administered in steps 1-8 from the total target dose. Steps 1-11 each took 15 min, and step 12 was prolonged to complete the target dose. Results: Eight pts (5\u2640), at a mean age of 44.7 years (range 33-63), with AIRs to ifliximab administered for Crohn's disease (2/8) and psoriasis (6/8) were included. The AIRs had occurred from the 2nd to the 12th (median 6.5) infusion and the mean time of reaction onset was 20.2 min from the beginning of the infusion. Referring to severity, 4pts reported mild and four moderate AIR, while only one was on concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. Positive intradermal testing was observed in 4/8 (50%) pts, all with a history of mild AIR. Atopy was documented in 2/8 pts. Twentysix RDs were performed; in all of them (26/26) the total target dose was successfully administered. In four pts, four AIRs (3mild/1moderate), all at the 12th step, were recorded; thus the reaction rate during RD was 15.98% (4/26). Conclusion: RD through the use of this 12 step-protocol, under the supervision of trained allergists, appears to be a safe and efficient method for re-administrating the full therapeutic dose of infliximab to a well selected population of pts with AIRs.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Poster Session 75"}, {"text": "Passive anti-EGFR immunotherapy in canine cancer patientsa comparative medicine study Background: Companion dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are prone to develop spontane-ous cancers, with comparable incidence rates as humans.

Moreover, we could confirm the specific binding of cetuximab to the canine EGFR leading to similar effects, i.e. silencing of growth signals and tumor growth inhibition. Frequent overexpression of ErbB-1 for example in canine mammary carcinomas proposes that it might be effectively targeted in passive anti-tumor immunotherapy. Method: We employed the variable regions of cetuximab 225 to generate a dog-mouse chimeric IgG antibody (can225IgG) targeted against EGFR. CHO DUKX-B11 cells were used for production of the antibody, which was then purified with Streptococcal Protein G. Biochemical integrity and folding of the recombinant antibody was assessed by immunoblots and CDspectroscopy. Specificity of the can225IgG was tested via flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy, immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting and ELISA. Viability assays were carried out to assess tumoricidic properties. Results: The recombinant can225IgG was proven to be intact and correctly assembled. Its specificity towards the naturally expressed canine EGFR and recombinant human EGFR could be confirmed repeatedly in several assays. Proliferation and viability trials verified the in vitro functionality of the antibody, showing significant tumor cell growth inhibition upon can225IgG treatment.

Background: Visceral leishmaniasis is a macrophage associated disorder which is linked with a profound decrease in the immunotherapeutic potential of the infected subjects leading to a marked reduction in the CD4 linked Th1 protective immune response. It greatly affects the liver leading to abnormal levels of SGPT and SGOT. Also the patients suffering from VL have been reported to be coinfected with Hepatitis C during some circumstances. Simultaneously the patients in Bihar are showing unresponsiveness towards SAG which is still a first line of drug in many countries around the world against Visceral Leishmaniasis. We have previously reported down regulation of CD2 co receptor on the surface of CD4 cells in patients suffering from Visceral Leishmaniasis. Stimulation of CD2 epitope with antiCD2 antibody has led to a remarkable increase in the Protein kinase C alpha mediated phosphorylation on CD2 co receptor on CD4 T cells, induction of IFN-c led Th1 dominated immune response, a substantial increase in the lymphoblast population and this response remained Th1 dominated even in the presence of Th2 predominant conditions signified with rIL4. Studies in the 1980s showed that biological immunomodulators such as interferon (IFN)-c can provide a missing signal and enhance the activity of antimonials in the treatment of VL and CL. Methodology/principal findings: In the present part of the study we have tried to evaluate the use of CD2 antibody as an immunotherapeutic agent along with SAG in ensuring treatment of BALB/c mice induced with experimental Visceral leishmaniasis. It has been found in the present set of studies that stimulation of CD2 co receptor along with along with therapeutic dose of SAG has led to the enhancement in the release of IFN-gamma which leads to the release of TNF-alpha and activates the macrophages. An increase in the NO mediated killing further observed by the activated macrophages leading to the reduction in the parasitic load. Conclusions/significance: The results indicate that enhancing the immune potential of a VL patient will help in the better response of Sodium Antimony Gluconate which is the first line of drug against VL in many countries.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1677"}, {"text": "Altered white matter tracts in the thalamus is associated with dyspnea in Gulf War illness Baraniuk, JN; Rayhan, RU Georgetown University Medical Center, Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy, Washington DC, United States Background: Gulf War Illness (GWI) subjects have many systemic complaints including shortness of breath. Dysfunctional central mechanisms have been associated with the perceptions of dyspnea. This has not been studied in GWI. Method: 24 GWI subjects who met Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Fibromyalgia criteria and 10 controls completed fMRI scans, WHO Dyspnea severity and UCSD Shortness of Breath scores. No subjects had airflow limitations. White matter structure was analyzed by non-invasive diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to identify potential correlates of dyspnea. Reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) indicates compromised white matter integrity. Increased axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) measure axonal injury and demyelination respectively. Results: Dyspnea scores were higher (P = 0.0002, 2-tailed unpaired t-test) in GWI [8.5 (6.2-10.8)] [M; (95% CI)] than controls [0.8 (0.04-1.6)]. UCSD scores were comparable (P = 0.008). Multivariate regression identified a positive correlation with the Dyspnea (R 2 = 0.28, P = 0.008) and UCSD (R 2 = 0.20, P = 0.028) scores as dependent variables with RD of the right anterior thalamic radiation (ATR) in GWI. Correlations were absent in controls. This suggests demyelination, oligodendrocyte dysfunction, or neuroinflammation. Conclusion: Lung and phrenic sensory afferents project to the thalamus. The ATR conveys fibers from the thalamus and prefrontal cortex for interoceptive processing. Loss of myelin integrity in the right ATR may contribute to the subjective perception of dyspnea in GWI. Background: Vaccination is one of the most important and effective preventive measures in modern medicine, but in recent years the number of people, especially children's parents, doubted the usefulness and necessity of vaccination. It is feared that vaccines can increase atopy and allergic diseases complicate the immune system or even weaken it. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of infectious respiratory diseases and atopic dermatitis (AD) among vaccinated and unvaccinated children during first 2 years of age. Method: The study was conducted retrospectively by selecting and evaluating health care cards. The chosen statistical significance level was P < 0.05. Subjects were followed from 6 months up to 2 years and retrospectively evaluated the incidence rate (incidence times during the observation period) of upper and lower respiratory tract infections, as well as the incidence of AD. The study population (n = 78) was divided into two groups according to vaccination (until 6 months of age) peculiarities. The first group comprised 45 children (29 girls/16 boys) fully vaccinated according to the Lithuanian children preventive immunisation schedule; the second (control) group comprised 33 unvaccinated children (18 girls/15 boys). Results: Vaccinated children morbidity rate of upper respiratory tract infections (4.64 AE 0.46) did not differ from the disease incidence rate (4.36 AE 0.49, P = 0.68) of unvaccinated children. The morbidity rate of lower respiratory tract infections in vaccinated children group was 0.24 AE 0.08, but not significantly lower than in the group of unvaccinated children (0.3 AE 0.09, P = 0.63). There was no significant difference in the incidence of AD among unvaccinated children (72.7%) and vaccinated children (66.7%, P = 0.54).

Background: Insect bite hypersensitivity (IBH) is an IgE-mediated dermatitis of horses caused by bites of insects of the genus Culicoides, that do not exist in Iceland. The prevalence of IBH is much higher in horses born in Iceland (where Culicoides are absent) and exported to the continent as adults, compared to Icelandic horses born in a Culicoides rich environment. The specific allergens causing IBH have recently been identified and expressed as recombinant proteins in E coli. The objective of this pilot study was to compare intradermal and intralymphatic vaccinations using four purified recombinant allergens, with and without Th1 focusing adjuvant. The final aim is the development of a preventive immunisation against IBH in Icelandic horses. Methods: Twelve healthy horses living in Iceland were vaccinated three times with a combination of four recombinant (r-)allergens (Culn1, Culn2, Culn5 and Culn9). Six horses were injected intralymphatically, three without and three with IC31 \u00e2 (kindly provided from Intercell, Vienna). Six additional horses were immunised intradermally, three without and three with IC31 \u00e2 . Serum was collected for analysis of antibody responses in western blot and ELISA. The horses were tested for potential sensitisation in a sulfidoleukotriene release test (CAST \u00e2 ) and in intradermal tests. Results: The r-allergens in IC31 \u00e2 adjuvant gave much stronger specific IgG responses to the allergens. Intralymphatic was slightly more efficient than intradermal immunisation. The IgG induced against all four allergens was mainly of the IgG1 and IgG4/7 subclasses and to a lesser extent IgG5. Postvaccination serum was able to block binding of serum IgE from IBHaffected horses to the respective r-allergen. The immunised horses did hardly produce any detectable specific IgE. There were also no indications of induction of IgE-mediated reactions as the horses did not respond to Culicoides extract stimulation in the CAST \u00e2 or to the recombinant allergens in intradermal tests.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Early child vaccination and incidence of acute respiratory infections and atopic dermatitis"}, {"text": "Conclusion: Vaccination of horses previously not exposed to the allergens both intralymphatically and intradermally with r-allergens in IC31 \u00e2 adjuvant was well-tolerated and induced immune response without IgE production. The horses produced IgG that could inhibit r-allergen-specific IgE-binding. We therefore conclude that both the injection methods and the IC31 \u00e2 adjuvant are strong candidates for further development of immunotherapy in horses.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Early child vaccination and incidence of acute respiratory infections and atopic dermatitis"}, {"text": "Blood eosinophil levels, proteomics patterns of strail and CXCL8, correlated survival with bevacizumab (anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody) treated stage-4 colon cancers Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) belongs to the most common malignancies and accounts for almost 10% of all cancer deaths in the Western World.

The aim of this study was to further analyze the factors associated with latex sensitisation and allergy. Method: This cross-sectional study involves 400 patients with spina bifida, aged 0-18 years, from a Reference Hospital of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. A questionnaire to identify immediate symptoms of latex allergy, as well as associated factors with sensitisation or latex allergy, was developed by experts and applied to the patients. Patient's blood was drawn for detection of serum specific IgE to latex, through Immu-noCAP \u00e2 technique. Symptomatic patients with positive specific IgE were considered allergic to latex, and asymptomatic patients with positive test were regarded as sensitised. The patients without allergic symptoms and with negative serum specific IgE to latex were the negative control group. The associations were analyzed by Mannwhitney test and chi-square test. Results: Patients mean age was 7.68 years, and 201 (50.25%) were female. Latex allergy was associated with: greater total number of surgeries (5 surgeries), greater number of orthopedic surgeries (3 surgeries), ventricular-peritoneal shunt (10 years of use), and intermittent bladder catheterization (5 years of use). When the allergic patients were compared with those sensitised, the former had the first surgery earlier (11 h of life), and a greater total number of surgeries (4 surgeries). These differences were statistically significant, with P < 0.05. Conclusion: Time of the first surgery and total number of surgeries differentiate patients sensitised and allergic to latex. Background: Screening patients in risk groups for latex allergy is an important but neglected procedure that must be standardised. The aim of this study was to develop a clinical SCORE of symptoms for screening of latex allergy. Method: This cross-sectional study involves 400 patients with spina bifida, aged 0-18 years, from a Reference Hospital of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. A questionnaire to identify immediate symptoms of latex allergy was developed by experts and applied to the patients. Cutaneous, nasal, ocular, oropharyngeal and pulmonary immediate symptoms were investigated. Patient's blood was drawn for the detection of serum specific IgE to latex, through ImmunoCAP \u00e2 technique. Symptomatic patients with positive specific IgE were considered allergic to latex. Discrepancy between the number of symptomatic patients and the number of sensitised patients with positive serum specific IgE to latex brought the proposal to establish a SCORE of symptoms. The SCORE was set inductively by values in accordance with the frequency of symptoms. Results: Patients mean age was 7.68 years, and 201 (50.25%) were female. There were 91 (22.75%) symtomatic patients, but only 49 (12.25%) of them were positive for serum specific IgE to latex. A SCORE equal to or <40% was associated with the diagnosis of latex allergy. The questionnaire had a sensitivity of 45% and a specificity of 85.3%. Symptomatic patients who had negative serum specific IgE to latex had low SCORES in the questionnaire of symptoms. Conclusion: The development of a clinical SCORE of symptoms can help in screening for the diagnosis of latex allergy. The SCORE showed good specificity being able to exclude the nonallergic patients with nonspecific symptoms. Background: To investigate grass and tree pollen sensitisation in patients diagnosed with latex allergy following latex provocation testing. Method: A retrospective case note study of adult patients presenting to a Leicester (UK) based allergy clinic. Data from a four year period (2008 and 2012) were reviewed and latex positive challenge patients identified. Results: Twelve patients had a positive latex challenge. 8/12 and 4/12 patients reacted to latex following cutaneous and mucosal exposure, respectively. 10/12 patients had a negative latex skin prick text (SPT) (<3 mm) and sIgE. Of these, 3/9 patients had positive SPTs to one (or more) of grass, birch and three tree (Hazel, Alder and Birch). All three of these patients had a history of seasonal rhinitis and 2/3 and 1/3 had a clinical history of oral allergy syndrome and latex fruit allergy, respectively. Latex allergy in 1/3 of these patients was diagnosed following a mucosal challenge. Conclusion: One case would have been missed without mucosal challenge and we propose that both cutaneous and mucosal provocation tests are required to exclude latex allergy. Without mucosal exposure the risk posed by intraoperative exposure to latex cannot be fully excluded. Heat labile panallergens such as the profilin Hev b 8 may cause latex allergy in a proportion of patients who have negative latex SPT and sIgE. Hev b 8 has previously been associated with latex sensitisation rather than latex allergy and further studies using challenge data and component resolved diagnostics are needed. Finally, although the incidence of latex allergy in health care workers is decreasing, it remains important to assess patients for latex allergy including those who have pollen related allergic disease. Latex exposure and its allergies among Albanian healthcare workers Background: The frequent and extensive use of latex gloves is known to noticeably impact the increasing prevalence of latex allergies among the health care workers. At the same time skin prick test is routinely used to evaluate the sensitivity to latex. The present study aims to evaluate the relationship between latex exposures its allergy, and skin prick test positivity in Albanian healthcare workers. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional study, at a university hospital centre, involving 662 nurses filling up a questionnaire. Simultaneously, we performed a skin prick test with latex and negative control solutions, on the forearm of each participant. From among them, 639 participants accepted to answer the questionnaire; while 602 accepted to undergo the skin prick test. RR and the chi-square test were used to test the differences. PASW Statistics 18 and MS Excel 2007 were used to analyze the data. Results: 2.33% (14) participants showed positive results for latex skin prick test; while 0.5% (3) participants showed positive results for both skin prick tests. On the other hand, 9.39% (60) participants reported at least one symptom related to latex exposure. In fact, those who used more than nine pairs of latex gloves were at a higher risk of developing allergy symptoms compared to those who used 5-9 and less than four pairs of gloves (RR 3.49, P < 0.05 and 2.48, P < 0.05 respectively). No significant differences were observed in the skin prick test positivity between these subgroups.

Objective: To evaluate the latex sensitivity, to emphasize the need of questionnaires before the first years of practice and follow up evaluation of latex sensitivity. Method: Dentistry students based on a large randomised and still in process study are being investigated for immediate or late reaction. Other allergy patterns like rhinitis, asthma, urticaria-related to latex-sensitivity are being evaluated.

Background: Formaldehyde is a low molecular weight chemical used in many industrial processes such as textile, manufactoring of plastics, rubbers, adhesives, nail polish, etc. It is also used as disinfecting, preserving and embalming agent, as well as a hair stabiliser and straingthner. Despite of its widespread use, cases of formaldehyde-induced occupational asthma has not frequently been reported. Case report: We report a 37 year-old smoker woman who had been working as a hairdresser for 20 years. In the last year she developed pruritic micropapular exudative eruption and vesicles located in hands, being diagnosed of allergic contact dermatitis by dermatologist. Moreover she complained of work related symptoms of rhinoconjunctivits and episodes of cough, dyspnea and wheezing, when she worked with SALERM \u00e2 blisters (25% formaldehyde solution) in the hairdressing. which are used for hair straighteing. These symptoms subside over holidays and dissapeared after she stopped working. Material, methods and results: Skin prick tests were negative to common inhalants. Patch testing using standard TRUE-TEST \u00e2 and hairdressing MARTI TOR \u00e2 series showed positive reactions (++) at 48 and 96 h to kathon CG, formaldehyde, pphenylenediamine, quaternium 15, ammonium persulfate, as well as the SALERM \u00e2 formaldehyde blister. A baselyne spirometry was normal and a metacholine inhalation test was negative in the period away from work. Initial FeNO measurement was 41 and 17 ppb after she stopped working. No eosinophils were found in a induced sputum sample. A specific inhalation challenge test with the SALERM \u00e2 blister (formaldehyde) was performed in a 7 m 3 dymamic closed-circuit chamber by means of opening and manipulating the blister simulating working condition. 7 h after the inhalation test, a 20% fall in FEV1 was observed, reaching a maximum fall in FEV1 of 45% at 9 h, with recovery after inhalation of beta2-adrenergic agent. 24 h after the specific inhalation test, the metacholine test became positive (PC20 3.5 mg/ml) and induced sputum samples showed an intense 30-40% eosinophilia.

It is clinically characterised by dark-brown pigmentation distributed on the chest, face and neck. The hyperpigmentation is caused by frequent and repeated contact with sensitising allergen. The allergen is hypothetically too low in concentration to produce typical eczematous dermatitis. Mostly fragrances and chemicals in cosmetics cause Riehl melanosis. Colophony is uncommon sensitiser of pigmented contact dermatitis. The accumulation of allergen results in allergic contact dermatitis. Histopathology showed vacuolization of basal cells, pigment incontinence and lymphocytic infiltrate in the dermis. Method: We performed patch test and photo patch test to five patients with Riehl melanosis in our clinic. Patch test and photo patch test of these patients used the standard, cosmetic, and fragrance series. A biopsy was taken from one patient. Results: Patch test and photo patch test of these patients using standard, cosmetic and fragrance series hardly showed positive reaction to suspected sensitisers. The only positive reaction in photo patch test was found in 1% colophony. Irritation was found in one patient by paraphenylene diamine. The biopsy taken from one patient demonstrated inextensive vacuolization of basal cells. Conclusion: Here we reported five cases of Riehl melanosis, with colophony as a sensitiser. Colophony is known as a sensitiser of allergic contact dermatitis. However, it is uncommon to cause pigmented contact dermatitis. Colophony can be found in several every day products, such as adhesive tapes, sealant, polishes, and waxes.

It may also have legal and administrative consequences for the doctor. Using medications whose effectiveness has been proven by scientific studies, yet are not licensed for a given indication, may be interpreted by law as a 'therapeutic experiments', which has a range of consequences for the treating physician. The aim of this study was to confront up-to-date recommendations for the treatment of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) with the scope of licensed use of recommended drugs according to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC). Method: The analysis was based upon the recent Polish and international recommendations regarding ACD treatment. A list of recommended drugs was compiled and confronted with the Official List of Medicinal Products that is in force in Poland. Medicinal products both recommended by expert bodies and allowed for ACD treatment in terms of SPC were indentified. Results: Only a half of the drugs recommended by experts for the therapy of ACD are officially licensed in Poland for treating this condition. Among drugs recommended for ACD treatment (topical and systemic glucocorticosteroids, topical and systemic immunosuppressants, barrier drugs and psoralens), only some topical and systemic glucocorticosteroids, as well as topical barrier drugs were licensed in Poland for the treatment of this disease. On the other hand, SPC of some old antihistamines (cyproheptadine, hydroxizine, clemastine) contained the indication for ACD treatment, despite lack of expert recommendation and scientific evidence that would support their effectiveness in this disease. Conclusion: There are considerable discrepancies between current expert recommendations for the treatment of allergic contact dermatitis and the licensed use of medicines as determined by the official product characteristics. The 'off-license' use of such drugs may be interpreted as 'therapeutic experiment' with a range of legal and administrative consequences, including the requirement for a patient\u2032s written consent, lack of reimbursement from the health insurance, no liability of the producer for adverse drug reactions, and no coverage of a possible damage from the physician\u2032s liability insurance.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1702"}, {"text": "Prevalence of mercury allergy and treatment of adverse events to dental materials Background: We did a cohort study of adverse health outcomes to dental materials to investigate the association between alloy dental treatment and the risk of potential adverse events. Method: Cohort study of 759 individuals diagnosed as having dental alloy adverse events. Results: We evaluated 491 (491 of 759, 64.6%) symptomatic dental patients with systemic and/or oral diseases associated with mercury amalgam. Median age was 44, 359 were female (73.1%), woman to man ratio 2.7:1. Of 491 patients with adverse clinical events to mercury amalgam, 325 underwent the patch testing (325 of 491, 66.1%). The current prevalence of allergy to mercury was 28.6% (in aggregate, as metallic mercury, ammoniated mercury, thimerosal, dental amalgam, all in petrolatum). Median urinary mercury levels in 70 patients was 1 lg/l. The most common adverse effects of amalgams are burning mouth syndrome (17.9%), contact dermatitis (16.9%), neurologic disorders (12.6%), oral lichen planus (10.0%), endocrine alterations (5.9%), chronic fatigue (4.1%). nine patients (1.8%, eight woman and one men) had positive serum anti-nuclear and all nine ANA-positive patients became ANA negative after mercury amalgam removal. Serum prolactin levels were elevated in six patients (1.2%) and return to normal levels after amalgam removal. Five patients (1.0%) had thermal regulation disorders (low cold tolerance) and reversed after amalgam removal. Three (3 of 491, 0.6%) patients had type III hypersensitivity reactions to mercury with elevated immune complexes. Two women with selective IgG subclass deficiency reversed after blood Hg fell to undetectable levels. One had mercury-induced low serum ACTH concentrations that returned to normal range after amalgam removal. Endo-osseous titanium dental implants were associated with oral and/or systemic conditions in 24 of 759 (3.1%). Clinical presentation included hemifacial edema, burning mouth syndrome, atypical facial pain, lichenoid stomatitis, leukopenia. Serious adverse events that were considered to be related to titanium dental implants placed in the vicinity of mercury amalgam were paraproteinemia, demyelinating disease, motor neuron disease. Treatment consists of safe amalgam and dental implants removal (en bloc technique). Conclusion: Allergy and exposure to dental alloys can adversely affect individuals more than previously estimated. Background: Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is an antigen specific, cell-mediated delayed type hypersensitvity. Unlike classic type IV reactions which occur in the dermis and are mediated by CD4+ T-lymphocytes, ACD is characterised by epidermal involvement with an infiltrate composed of CD4+, CD45RO+, TCR alpha beta T-lymphocytes. The sensitisation period may vary from days to years. In the acute phase, ACD is characterised by erythema, edema, papules, vesicles, oozing, and crusting. In the chronic stage, involved areas are lichenified and fissured. We report a case of a patient with a two year history of chronic labial dermatitis. Methods: Ten-year-old boy with no significant past medical history who presented for allergy evaluation. Two years prior to presentation, he developed 'yellow lesions,' foul-smelling breath, along with intermittent bleeding and peeling of his top and bottom lip. He denied mucosal involvement or rash elsewhere. He was afebrile and did not experience systemic complications such as joint pain, respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. There was no history of food or seasonal allergies, asthma, or eczema. The family reported routine use of a toothpaste containing mini breath strips as well as mint flavoring. Results: Allergen patch testing was performed using the family's toothpaste containing the mini breath strips and mint flavoring, a regular tartar protection toothpaste, and a ready-to-use patch test system containing 29 allergens and allergen mixes. Positive result was obtained for the toothpaste containing the mini breath strips and mint flavoring. The remainder of items tested negative (including the regular tartar protection toothpaste). Comparison of the toothpaste ingredients indicates that possible allergens are PEG-12, cocamidopropyl betaine, and methylcellulose. Our patient\u2032s symptoms resolved completely after avoidance of all products containing PEG-12, cocamidopropyl betaine, and methylcellulose. Conclusions: We report a novel case of toothpaste-associated allergic contact dermatitis caused by PEG-12, cocamidopropyl betaine, or methylcellulose. To our knowledge, none of these contact allergens have been reported in association with toothpaste ACD. The most common toothpaste ACD triggers include cinnamic aldehyde, spearmint, peppermint, menthol, and carvone. Physicians need to consider ACD as an etiology for lip eruption. Background: The use of scientifically correct terminology both determines and reflects our understanding of the surrounding world. From immunological point of view, small molecular weight substances that cause contact allergy are haptens, and not 'allergens'. Method: An analysis of the differences between the terms 'hapten' and 'allergen' and of the possible scientific and administrative consequences of using the incorrect terminology, based on literature search and analysis of legal documents. Results: There are substantial differences between these two types of sensitising agents: Haptens can penetrate through intact epidermal barrier, while allergens cannot. After entering the body, allergens are instantly recognised by the immune system, while haptens have to undergo complicated processes resulting in creation of antigens consisting mainly (>99%) of body's own proteins. As a results, there are more similarities of contact allergy to autoimmunity than to immediate-type allergy. Skin tests to allergens (e.g. prick tests or intracutaneous tests) are connected with a considerable risk of anaphylaxis, while it is exceptionally rare in case of haptens. Regardless substantial differences, the tendency of referring to haptens as 'allergens' seems to be more widespread nowadays than a century ago, hinting on a decline in clinicians' understanding of the underlying mechanisms. This seems to encourage some allergists to copy their knowledge about allergens (e.g. in allergic rhinitis) while diagnosing or treating contact allergies, e.g. treating contact dermatitis with antihistamines or attempts at 'desensitising' to haptens. Most unfortunately, the improper terminology has also influenced regulatory bodies, which now mistake haptens for allergens, too. As a consequence, without much consideration they tend to classifying nowadays haptens as 'therapeutic drugs', in analogy to therapeutic allergens for immunotherapy. With estimated 3.5 thousand environmental haptens, most of them relevant each to a relatively small group of people, the cost involved in a registration of such haptens as 'drugs' would make production of most patch test substances economically unsustainable, thus taking away from millions of patients the chances for having the cause of their disease identified. Conclusion: Using imprecise and incorrect terminology may affect both doctors\u2032 and regulators\u2032 understanding of a medical problem, and directly or indirectly decrease patients\u2032 chance for cure.

Chromate might have been restricted in cement; however it is not restricted in leather, which might explain the absence of a decline in sensitisations to chromate. Furthermore, a number of patients might have been sensitised before legal restrictions were introduced. The same is true for nickel restrictions. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the patch test results of the baseline series are subject to trends and other developments over time, but respond slowly to legal restrictions.

In 2012, a 56-year-old nonsmoker female reported gingival bleeding and white patches on the maxillary buccal mucosa accompanied by commissural cheilitis. She had received 8 dental alloy crowns and six endosseous dental titanium implants. Method: The patient was evaluated for allergological, immunological, and toxicological assessment. Results: Skin patch testing showed weak allergic reaction (+) to gold thiosulfate at 0.5% at 96 h. Lymphocyte blastization test (LTT) revealed strong sensitisation to nickel (29.2), cadmium (6.6), molibdenum (2.4), inorganic mercury (2.8), zirconium (2.3), and LTT confirmed the sensitivity of gold (8.0). Biopsy of the maxillary buccal gingiva was consistent with plasma cell gingivitis with moderate vacuolization in circumscribed areas of epithelial basal membrane. There was no cytological evidence of malignancy in the dorsal mucosa of the tongue nor visible tongue mucosal lesions. Culture of the lesions grew Escherichia coli in four occasions. Gold and nickel concentrations in saliva sample were 68.2 and 2.8 micrograms per gram, respectively (Au limit value, 0.2; Ni limit value, 7.9). After removal, we measured the emission of mercury vapor from the largest mercury filling and it was 42.3 lg/m 3 . Laboratory investigations revealed leucopenia, eosinophilia, and modest hypercalcemia as well as hyperomocysteinemia. After amalgam-treatment removal (two dental amalgams) and complete removal of 17 rootcanal metal-based posts, and three alloy crowns she achieved a complete remission of plasma cell gingivitis after 9 months of treatment. The patient has never been subjected to pharmacological treatments with topical and/or systemic corticosteroids. Plasma cell gingivitis has been associated with use of chewing gum, candy, food, and oral hygiene products (e.g. toothpaste). The exact mechanism by which mercury amalgam may cause plasma cell gingivitis is not known. Conclusion: This case demonstrates that allergic plasma cell gingivostomatitis was due to allergic sensitisation to intra-oral metals. Background: Glyceryl monoesters (monoglycerides) are common ingredients of cosmetics and are used mostly as skin conditioning agents. There are no reports about allergic reactions to the monoester glyceryl caprylate (2,3-dihydroxypropyl octanoate). Case report: A 39 year-old woman presented with a several year history of recurrent eczema of her face. She had used various skin care products in the past and suspected, among others, Linola face cream (Linola Gesicht \u00e2 ) of having induced her dermatitis. Methods: Patch testing was performed according to the guidelines of the German Contact Dermatitis Research Group (DKG) using allergens provided by Almirall, Reinbek, Germany (German baseline series, external products series, preservatives series, fragrances series) and several of the patient's own cosmetics. Results: Positive reactions were observed to potassium dichromate, nickel sulfate, rosin, fragrance mix and its ingredient oakmoss (evernia prunastri), propolis and to several of the patient's own cosmetics, among them Linola Gesicht \u00e2 . Patch testing with the single ingredients of Linola Gesicht \u00e2 revealed a 3+ reaction in the 2D, 3D, 4D readings to glyceryl caprylate (5% pet.). In a further patch test positive reactions were observed also to lower concentrations of glyceryl caprylate (1+ to 0.1% pet., 3+ to 1% pet. in the 3D reading). None of the three healthy control persons reacted to glyceryl caprylate. Upon avoiding contact with cosmetics containing this substance the patient has remained symptom free.

Concurrent mercury-related disorders were right acute otomastoiditis, burning mouth, xerostomia, dysgeusia (metallic taste), atypical facial pain, and gingival bleeding, and weight loss. She had seven mercury-containing dental amalgams and OLP lesions were located in close topographical association with four amalgams. She had three high-palladium metal ceramic crowns. Method: We did biopsy, allergological, and toxicological investigations. Results: November 2011, on inspection, OLP involving right buccal mucosa and tongue, on the right latero-dorsal surface. The patient\u2032s medical history included cholecystectomy. OLP had started 15 days after dental hygiene as tongue lesions and rapidly progressed into right buccal mucosa. OLP lesions had has been present for one month and biopsy specimen of buccal mucosa lesion revealed oral lichen planus. Skin patch-testing disclosed allergic reactions to metallic mercury 0.5% (+) and mercury ammonium chloride 0.1% (+) at 96 h. Lymphocyte transformation test showed sensitisation to cadmium (3.64), molybdenum (2.40), nickel (2.42) [limit stimulation index <2]. Nickel was elevated even in serum (2.83 lg/l). Her saliva mercury level was 8.8 lg/l. Intraoral mercury vapor was 47 lg/l. Blood mercury concentrations was 1.50 lg/l, whereas urinary mercury levels was 1.40. She had two amalgam tattoos. Fish consumption occurred about six times per month. We removed all (n = 7) amalgam fillings by using a safe procedure (lift-on technique), decreasing the levels of exposure to mercury vapor. Six months after total amalgam removal, complete resolution of the oral white patches -OLP lesionswas noted and follow-up laboratory tests showed that mercury in blood, urine, intraoral air, and saliva fell below quantifiable levels. Mercury released from amalgam is deposited into oral mucosa, eliciting an intense inflammatory response sensitisation. Early diagnosis is paramount in the successful treatment of OLP related to allergy and exposure to mercury amalgam and we do not recommend steroids before amalgam removal. Conclusion: OLP in this patient was caused by mercury amalgam fillings released in massive quantities during dental hygiene procedures.

Background: Oral nickel administration has been demonstrated useful in treating patients suffering from Systemic Nickel Allergy Syndrome (SNAS). In the published trials, the treatment lasted one year maximum and ended in general with a safe reintroduction of nickel rich foods in the diet by the majority of patients. At present, no follow up studies were published. In the present work we report a 8 month follow up of a group of patient previously treated by 1 year of oral nickel therapy. Methods: Eight months after the discontinuation of a successfully oral nickel therapy, 20 patients were administered a questionnaire asking questions similar to the those to which they answered at the time of enrollment in the therapeutic trial. In particular, patients were asked to report cutaneous and gastrointestinal clinical symptoms, the tolerance to nickel rich foods (during the therapeutic trial they were provided three lists of foods according their nickel content, from the lowest to the highest) and to indicate in a VAS their clinical condition in relation to the SNAS, as they did at the end of the nickel desensitisation. Results: Fifteen patients reported the reappearance of both cutaneous and gastrointestinal symptoms after 5-7 month from the discontinuation of the treatment when ingesting the foods with the highest nickel content. In particular, they reported generalised itching, urticaria, meteorism and intestinal colic. Four patients were had gastrointestinal and cutaneous symptoms with the highest nickel containing foods after 4 months and of the medium nickel containing foods after 7 months. One patient still tolerated all nickel containing foods. VAS values were consistent with the answers to the questionnaires. Conclusions: Oral nickel treatment in SNAS patients has been demonstrated clinically useful. However, one year treatment seems to be insufficient in maintaining the obtained beneficial effects as many patients progressively experience a reappearance of symptoms in relation with the food nickel content. Longer trials are needed to determine the optimal duration of the oral nickel treatment. Background: Nickel is a well-known hapten as an etiologic factor in type IV hypersensitivity reactions. Our aim was to evaluate the type of T helper cell response by determining the secreted cytokines in Ni-stimulated primary peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures in nickel allergic patients. Method: Patients who were determined as sensitive to nickel sulphate according to their patch test results and healthy subjects were enrolled into the study. Atopy, symptoms, familial history of nickel allergy, complaints with wearing jewellery were determined with detailed history. Lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) was performed with various concentrations of nickel sulphate in PBMCs. The LTT was considered as positive when the stimulation index was 2 or higher. IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-c levels were detected in the culture supernatant by ELISA. Results: Thirty-nine patients (30 female, mean age: 45.17 AE 15.03), ten healthy controls (eight female, 34.9 AE 12.06) were evaluated. Atopy, familial history, complaints with jewellery were determined in 13, 8 and 30 patients respectively. Various oral symptoms were reported in 27 patients. Skin symptoms and respiratory symptoms were found in 7 and 2 patients respectively. Three patients reported both oral and skin symptoms. The LTT stimulation index was significantly higher in the patient group than the control group (P < 0.001). Similarly IL-4 levels was found significantly higher in the patient group than the control group (P = 0.035), whereas IL-10 and IFN-c levels were not different. Conclusion: The significant increase of IL-4 found in the patient group suggests that the T helper 2 cells were the predominant responsive cells. This finding may be an evidence for Type I hypersensitivity to nickel in nickel allergic patients. Background: Nickel is the most common metal that causes contact dermatitis which is a long life disease. But apart from this form of hypersensitivity, patients may manifest systemic nickel allergy syndrome with cutaneous and extracutaneous signs like respiratory ones. Case report: Hereby we present the case of a 34 year old female with dispnea and cough from 6 weeks. She referred also for angioedema and rash related to the usage of expensive creams, or another one that had nickel among its ingredients. After cream application she had eyelid angioedema and facial rash. The patient mentioned to have episodic dipnoea after almonds or cans of Red Bull energy drink consumption. The woman had suffered before from contact dermatitis after the usage of cheap earrings. Her son had atopic dermatitis during childhood. The skin prick test with food and inhalant allergens resulted negative. Patch test revealed positive results (+++) for nickel. We recommended her to avoid contact with metals and food with high concentration of nickel like almonds, canned food and beverages. We also prescribed her antihistamines, glucocorticoids. After 2 months she rarely had symptoms. Discussion: Low concentration nickel diet lead to the improvement of the symptoms in some patients. But nickel is a kind of metal that is found in soil, water and food, so it not always easy to respect the physician advices. In some cases avoidance of metal contact is not sufficient because signs are not only locally seen only but even as o form of a systemic reaction (respiratory and cutaneous signs). Conclusions: As nickel may aggravate contact dermatitis or even the symptoms of systemic nickel allergy syndrome, low concentration of nickel in diet plays an important role apart from the traditional treatment with antihistamines and corticosteroids.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1711"}, {"text": "Background/purpose: The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of omalizumab, evaluating the clinical course in three patients with refractory Chronic Autoimmune", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1711"}, {"text": "Urticaria-Angioedema (CAU-A). Introduction: CAU-A affects about one third of all patients with urticaria. The mechanism leading to chronic urticaria often remains unclear. Up to half of patients are thought to have functional circulating IgG auto antibodies against the high-affinity IgE receptor (FceR1) or, in a few cases, even against IgE. These antibodies are able to release histamine in vitro from basophils and mast cells. The disease becomes uncontrolled despite the high doses of antihistamines and corticosteroids or additional immunomodulators, that are known to be unsafe and less desirable when used for prolonged terms. Taking into account that autoimmune aetiology is often related to severe urticarial cases, treatment with omalizumab may be an alternative regimen in patients who do not respond to conventional treatments. Methods: We conducted an analysis of three patients with refractory CAU-A, who were recruited from the Department of Allergy at 'Hospital G omez-Ulla' in Madrid, Spain. On an initial dose of omalizumab 225 mg every 2-4 weeks, the three patients achieved remission. The dose of antihistamines required to control CAU also decreased. No serious adverse events was noted. Results: The respond to treatment in our cases was compared with reports from PubMed. Down regulation of FceR1 was observed in association with significant improvement and discontinuation of other immunosuppressive medications. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of omalizumab in treating this condition. However, the duration of disease is not related to treatment response. Instead, it is known to be a higher prevalence of personal or family history of allergic diseases in those who follow remission; which indicates that allergic diseases may be a favorable factor for predicting remission after omalizumab treatment. Conclusion: The collective evidence points to omalizumab as a safe and effective treatment option for patients with CAU-A who do not sufficiently respond to standard therapy as recommended by the existing guidelines. Background: Chronic urticaria is usually controlled by sustained high doses of antihistamines either associated with leukotriene receptor antagonists or on their own. On some occasions symptomatology may persist, which requires the uninterrupted use of oral corticoids, assuming their consequent side effects. Here we present our experience in the treatment of this type of urticaria applying anti-IgE (Omalizumab). Method: Six patients (three males and three females aged between 44 and 66) suffering from long-term urticaria (within the range of 2-37 years) and poorly responding to treatment have been treated. The initial dosage of Omalizumab was calculated on the basis of the patients\u2032 weight and total serum IgE level. Anti-IgE was administered every four weeks in all cases. In three patients the dose was increased up to 300 mg due to worsening during the days previous to scheduled dose administration. Results: All the patients experienced marked improvement, which started at the beginning of the first week after the first dose. All the patiens discontinued oral corticoids and in four of them antihistamines were also withdrawn. The three patients who exhibited slight exacerbation symptoms during the days previous to the Omalizumab administration dose completely improved after increasing the dose up to 300 mg every four weeks. No adverse reaction was detected and presently the six patients remain asymptomatic and following the anti-IgE treatment. Conclusion: Patients with long-term and poor outcome chronic urticaria responded favourably to Omalizumab treatment in all cases, achieving not only suspension of corticoid treatment but also withdrawal of remaining medication in most cases. It should be noted that in some cases the dosage calculated according to weight and IgE-levels seems to be insufficient, in which instance it is necessary to increase it up to 300 mg every 4 weeks. Case report: Cold contact urticaria (CCU) is a common subtype of physical urticaria. It is characterised by the development of wheal and/or angioedema within minutes after cold contact. We report 2 patients with cold urticaria with different response to treatment with omalizumab (Xolair \u00e2 ).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1711"}, {"text": "Clinical manifestation of CCU can range from mild, localised whealing to life-threatening anaphylactic shock reactions.

In our case reports, we want to highlight that there is still a small group of patients without benefit from omalizumab treatment.

Symptoms typically occur in minutes after skin exposure to cold air, liquids and objects. Most common method to confirm the diagnosis of CU is ice-cube-challenge test but %20 of patients with CU have negative ice-cube challenge tests. The greatest risk with this kind of urticaria is development of systemic reaction resulting in a hemodynamic collapse during generalised cold exposure. We present a case who developed CU and anaphylaxis during swimming and diving in the sea. Case: A 13-year-old girl was admitted to our hospital with history of multiple episodes of generalised urticaria while swimming in the sea. On the last episode she experienced feeling of fainting and dizziness after diving into the sea. She did not have any symptoms in warm water. There was no family history of cold urticaria. Her physical examination was normal. An ice cube challenge test was performed and it resulted a wheal within 10 min. Her laboratory tests were normal except for antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer. Her ANA titer was found 1/320 positive. Management of her condition involved avoidance of swimming in cold water and carriage of an adrenaline auto-injector. Conclusion: Cold urticaria is a uncommon form of physical urticaria that can cause life threating reactions. We presented this case in order to draw attention to these systemic reactions and prevention strategies of cold urticaria.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A case of idiopathic cold urticaria and anaphylaxis"}, {"text": "A case of progesterone-induced recurrent urticaria in a patient with polycystic ovary syndrome Background: Progesterone and its analogues have many medical applications in various obstetric and gynecologic conditions. Progesterone-induced urticaria is a rare disorder and typically occurs in females due to an autoimmune phenomenon to endogenous progesterone production, but it can also be caused by exogenous synthetic progesterone. Here, we present a case of recurrent urticaria that occurred after progesterone administration. Case: A 32-years-old woman with polycystic ovary syndrome visited an allergy clinic due to whole body urticaria that occurred about 1 h after taking one table of oral progesterone. Previously, the patient had been treated with oral and injectable progesterone intermittently for anovulation and pregnancy without any side effect and allergic reaction. However she had experienced urticaria over a period of 1 month after an intra-muscular injection of progesterone 3 months ago. Intradermal testing revealed a positive progesterone reaction after 15 min, and subsequently, she complained of injection site swelling and pruritic urticaria that persisted for several days. The patient then underwent ovulation induction to evaluate response to endogenous progesterone and a mild but non-significant urticarial reaction developed. Conclusion: We suggest that the potential risk of autoimmune progesterone-induced urticaria caused by exogenous progesterone be recognised and included in the differential diagnosis of recurrent urticaria that develops after progesterone administration. Background: It is known, that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is linked the pathology of the gastrointestinal tract. According to some authors, H. pylori may be the cause of the urticaria. But some patients with chronic urticaria have no clinical signs of gastroduodenal pathology. Purpose: To compare the efficacy of diagnostic methods for detecting of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in patients with chronic urticaria (CU). Method: Forty-four patients were observed with CU, who had clinical and specific allergic examination and additional consultation of other specialists, including a gastroenterologist. During examination in all patients with CU pathology of the gastrointestinal tract was found. Helicobacter pylori infection was diagnosed with noninvasive methodurea breath test, and invasive method of bacteriological investigation during fibrogastroduodenoscopy. Gastric mucosal biopsy specimens were incubated at 37\u00b0C in nutrient substratum during 5 days. The amount of H. pylori was calculated in colony forming units per gram of gastric mucosa (CFU/g).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1724"}, {"text": ": Analysis of the data showed that 20 patients had positive urea breath test (45.5%). During bacteriological examination 17 patients had level of H. pylori contamination more than 104 CFU/g. This result had match with urease test in 85% of patients. Twenty-four patients had negative results of H. pylori urease test. In this case, bacteriological method did not confirm H. pylori infection also. All in all urease test showed sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 89%. Conclusion: Urease test has high sensitivity and specificity. We can consider that a non-invasive method for diagnosing infection H. pylori is sufficiently informative and can be recommended for screening in patients with CU to identify H. pylori, even if the patient has no clinical signs of gastroduodenal pathology. Background: Patients with chronic idiopatic urticaria (CIU) very often have autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD). However, the impact of this disease on the urticaria has not been studied. Purpose: To evaluate the features of chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD). Method: Sixty-five patients with CIU were examined clinically and for specific allergologic examination. Additionally they underwent Autologous Serum Skin Test (ASST). Severity of disease was determined by presentation of the main symptoms of the disease (number of urticarias and intensity of pruritus) and evaluated on a scale from 0 to 6. Patients were assigned to counseling other specialists, including endocrinologist. Results: Twenty-eight patients (43%) with CIU were diagnosed with ATD, they had high level of antithyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOab). Patients with a combination of CIU and ATD were included into investigation group, and the comparison group was consisted of patients (37 men) suffering from urticaria, but do not have a high level of TPOab. The median severity of chronic urticaria in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis was four points (2.38, 5.11), while in the comparison group this figure was equal to only three points (2.0; 4.0) (P = 0.047). In addition, in the study group ASST was positive in 64% patients, in the comparison group in 16% of patients, respectively. Should be noted that between the level of TPOab and the severity of the CIU, a direct correlation of medium strength (r = 0.541, P = 0.048), and between the same indicator and positive samples with ASST correlation was not valid (r = 0.51, P = 0.079). Conclusion: Patients with CIU are very often diagnosed with autoimmune thyroid disease. The patients with combined CIU and ATD had more severe urticaria. The higher the level of antibodies to thyroid peroxidase linked to more severe CIU clinical course. In addition, patients with ATD more often diagnosed with autoimmune urticaria. Background: Urticaria is a common disease in the dermatological-allergological outpatient clinic in daily practice. The aetiologies of chronic urticaria (CU) in tropical countries remains incompletely understood because of limited data. The aim of this study was to examine some of the possible etiologies of severe therapy resistant CU in a tropical island. Method: We evaluated 63 patients, who had problems in controlling their urticaria by antihistamine drugs, referred from January 2005 to December 2011 to our unit. Complete history and physical examination were performed in all patients. Patients were investigated for complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood chemistry, liver function tests, serum levels of complement C3, C4, and C1 inhibitor, free thyroxin, TSH, IgE total, infective panel, H. Pylory IgG antibodies, stool examination, Skin Prick Test (SPT) with inhalant and food allergens, patch test with European Standard Series. All patients were tested also to acetylsalicylic acid. Results: One inducing factor has been found in 52.8%. Aspirin has been identified as urticaria provoking factor in 9%, atopy-18%, infection-14%, stress-7%, dermographism-9%, and pressure-6%. Parasites were found in 4% with clinical correlation. SPT to foods was positive in 6%, to inhalants-4%, positive reaction to patch test-8%. 14 patients (22%) Background: Cyclosporine has been proposed as next line treatment for H1-antihistamine refractory chronic urticaria (CU). There are limited data which support cyclosporine treatment in Korean CU patients. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cyclosporine in the management of CU. Method: The electronic medical records at the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (Jan. 2003-Oct. 2012) were reviewed to identify CU patients treated with cyclosporine. Clinical characteristics and cyclosporine doses were compared between responders and non-responders. Outcomes and adverse reactions were also investigated. Results: Total of sixty four patients was enrolled. Fifty four (84.4%) patients showed the improvement of symptoms; 25 (39.1%) achieved complete absence of urticaria. Ten (15.6%) of 64 showed no response. The clinical characteristics including total serum IgE, specific IgE to common allergens and autoantibodies were not different between the groups. The mean starting dose of cyclosporine was higher in responders than in non-responders (2.3 AE 0.9 vs 1.5 AE 1.1 mg/kg, P < 0.05). In 11 patients (20.4%) of 54, remission was sustained more than 3 months without any medication. Twenty nine patients (53.7%) required anti-histamine to sustain remission and 9 (16.7%) experienced symptom-aggravation and recurrence after the cessation of cyclosporine. Adverse reactions occurred in 42.2% (n = 27). Most common adverse reaction was gastrointestinal symptom. In four patients, cyclosporine was discontinued within first 1 month because of adverse reactions. Adverse reactions were tolerable in other 23 patients after dose reduction. Four (21.1%) of 19 patients who received cyclosporine for more than 6 months showed adverse reactions such as edema, hirsutism, nephrotoxocity and hepatotoxicity, respectively. Conclusion: Adverse reactions were generally mild and reversible by dose reduction even in long-term treatment. With adequate starting dose and treatment period, cyclosporine could be an effective and safe therapeutic option for those with uncontrolled or steroid-dependent CU in Korea.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 4150, "end": 4155, "text": "(22%)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "1:640. Additionally, her mitochondrial M2 antibody was significantly elevated at 131 IU/ml. Given the positive AMA and M2 antibody titers, she underwent liver biopsy which showed granulomatous portal inflammation and bile duct inflammation diagnostic of PBC. Conclusion: We are aware of only two case reports describing urticarial rash as the presenting symptom of PBC. This is the first case report of PBC with normal hepatic panel and GGT presenting with pruritus and urticaria. Current recommendations suggest minimising laboratory evaluation in uncomplicated cases of CU, however, this case describes an uncomplicated patient who after laboratory evaluation for CU was diagnosed with PBC. Therefore, we suggest a broader laboratory assessment should still be considered in patients with CU even in the absence of other signs or symptoms.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "Higher monocyte counts and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rates in severe chronic spontaneous urticaria Background: A uniform approach to severe chronic allergic and related diseases has been recently proposed in a MeDALL -GA(2)LEN -ARIA position paper (Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 2012). Concepts of disease severity, activity, control and responsiveness to treatment have been proposed as a way to streamline research and routine management. From the point of view of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) a severe and refractory to treatment phenotype requires characterisation and identification of specific biomarkers. Method: In search of such markers we carried out a study on 210 patients (mean age 42.4 years; range 18-81; 141 women): 130 patients with a mild CSU (mCSU) and 80 patients with difficult-to-treat severe CSU (sCSU). We investigated differences in demographics, clinical course (disease duration, age of onset, presence of angioedema and signs of delayed-pressure urticaria, corticosteroids use), autologous serum skin test (ASST) positivity, intolerance of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, thyroid autoimmunity, Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection, blood hematology and biochemistry. In addition to these variables, 41 responders (R) to antihistamine treatment and 39 non-responders (NR) in the sCSU group were more extensively examined using physician-assessed symptom scores (0\u00c43) for wheals and itch, 100 mm visual analogue scales (VAS) for disease-related discomfort and for urticaria specific quality of life (UQoL). Results: We did not find any differences in disease duration, presence of angioedema, signs of delayed-pressure urticaria, ASST positivity and HP infection. However, among the blood indices erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (P = 0.005) and monocyte counts (P < 0.001) stood out as distinct delimiters between mCSU and sCSU. In addition a trend was outlined for higher monocyte counts in NR sCSU (P = 0.06). As expected corticosteroid use was significantly increased in sCSU vs mCSU (P < 0.001), and in NR vs R groups; (P = 0.004); the NR sCSU patients had higher symptom scores (P < 0.001) and poorer UQoL (P = 0.003). Conclusion: Higher symptom score, corticosteroid use and low UQoL are characteristic features of sCSU. Our data do not confirm observations that autoimmune CSU is related to the severity of the disease. Increased ESR and monocyte counts suggest that characteristic systemic inflammation is present in those patients. To our knowledge this is the first report of increased monocytes in sCSU. Background: Chronic urticaria (CU) is a rather frequent skin disorder with an estimated prevalence of 0.5-1%. Recently, some evidence of the possible involvement of the coagulation cascade in the pathogenesis of CU has suggested. We evaluated the association of blood coagulation and CU. Method: Twenty-one patients with CU were prospectively collected from January 2012 to July 2012. Platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromnboplastin time (aPTT), Fibrinogen, antithrombin III, FDP and D-dimer were measured. Results: Of the total study patients, the mean age was 42.1 years and the mean disease duration of CU was 25 weeks. All the coagulation markers were within normal range. There were no significant correlation between coagulation markers and clinical parameters including disease duration, the presence of angioedema, atopy, except that disease severity of CU was inversely correlated with antithrombin III (r = \u00c00.531, P = 0.023). Conclusion: Blood coagulation markers in CU patients were within normal range. Disease severity of CU was inversely correlated with antithrombin III. Background: Many studies report an association between chronic urticaria (CU) and autoimmune disorders. In literature a link between CU and Coeliac disease (CD) has been previously reported, mostly in pediatric population. A 47 year old woman came to our observation reporting chronic urticaria with daily flares since the age of 42. No other symptoms were reported. She had only been diagnosed with autoimmune thyroiditis at the age of 41. Method: A detailed hystory was collected. Blood tests, microbiological screening, autoimmunity blood markers, chest X-rays and head CT, abdominal echo scan, prick tests for common food and aero allergens were performed. Autologous serum skin test (ASST) was also carried out, following EAACI/GA 2 LEN guidelines. Results: The patient\u2032s history did not suggest any possible trigger factor for urticaria. All the investigations described above were negative. ASST were clearly positive (ASST mean weal \u00c0normal saline mean weal \u2265 1.5 mm). Immunologic investigations confirmed autoimmune thyroiditis and surprisingly showed positive IgA antihuman tissue transglutaminase (hTTG) antibodies. Endoscopy with bowel biopsy was then performed, and CD was diagnosed. Our patient was put on a gluten-free diet with complete recovery of urticaria. Three months later she was reassessed. She had no urticarial lesions, normal value of hTTG antibodies was detected while positivity of serum antithyroid antibodies persisted. During the same follow-up assessment, ASST was performed both with the same day serum (negative result) and with the serum collected at the time of the first assessment (positive result).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1734"}, {"text": "Conclusion: Our report shows the importance of CD screening in patients with CU. CD screening should be performed whenever a positive ASST is detected, not only in children but also in adults, even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms and even in the presence of other known auto-immune diseases. In fact in our patient CD rather than autoimmune thyroiditis seems to play a role as the autoreactive component of urticaria, since the persistence of positivity of antithyroid antibodies only coexists with CU resolution and ASST shift. From a pathogenic perspective, per-sistence of skin reactivity to the serum collected at the time of first assessment, suggests that exclusion of an exogenous trigger rather than reduction in autoreactivity is at the basis of CU resolution.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1734"}, {"text": "Background: Non-hereditary angio-edema (AE) is characterised by local swelling due to self-limiting, subcutaneous or submucosal extravasation of fluid, and is divided in several subtypes. Clinical features of these subtypes are not profoundly described. We investigated the clinical characteristics of symptoms and potential differences in clinical presentation of AE subtypes. Method: Patients presenting with AE at our tertiary outpatient clinic filled out a questionnaire to document clinical characteristics, potential triggers, location and severity of AE using visual analogue scales (VAS). Results: 106/165 (64%) returned the questionnaire. Twenty-five patients had idiopathic AE, 64 urticaria-associated AE, 15 drug-associated AE, and two had AE due to other causes. Most patients reported prodromal symptoms (60%) and multiple locations for an attack (63%). Face and oropharynx were main locations of AE attacks of any subtype, swelling was the dominant symptom. Overall severity of the last attack was indicated as severe by 69% of the patients. There were no differences between the subgroups. Case report: We report a case of Walden-strom\u2032s macroglobulinemia causing an acquired deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor in a 40-year-old woman. She initially presented with an episode of angioedema followed by many episodes of abdominal distention associated with pain, vomiting, and diarrhea for 1.5 years. Work-up revealed low C1 esterase inhibitor levels, normal C3, and nonexistent C4. A diagnosis of acquired C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency was proposed at the time. However, it was also noted that her IgM was very elevated with an IgM monoclonal gammopathy with kappa light chains, and an enlarged spleen. Bone marrow biopsy and aspirate revealed clonal B-cells staining positively for CD20. She was diagnosed with Waldenstrom\u2032s macroglobulinemia in association with C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency. Although the association is recognised, it is extremely rare, and likely secondary to antibodies against C1 esterase inhibitor. After treatment with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone, her paraprotein levels fell to normal range, and her autoimmune parameters normalised with significant clinical improvement. She has not had any further episodes of angioedema. She will continue on rituximab as maintenance therapy for two more years. In summary, acquired deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor is quite rare with fewer than 150 cases in the literature. Given that most cases are related to antibodies against C1 esterase inhibitor, rituximab may be the treatment of choice.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1734"}, {"text": "Hereditary angioedema with the signs of acute urticaria: a case report Method: Thirty-two year-old woman was presented to our hospital with 12 days of generalised skin purit and burning sensation of the whole body, breathing difficulties, abdominal pains with liquid on percussion, erythematous rash, facial and eyelid swelling with signs with palpebral conjunctivitis. She refers that she use to take oral contraceptives since 4 months. We treated her for acute urticaria with levocetirisine 5 mg at bedtime, fexophenadine 180 mg morning time, and methylprednisolone 125 mg intravenously every six hours without results on clinical icon, symptoms still persist. She was treated for the ocular conjunctivitis. Results: Laboratory testing was performed and she had a low C4 level 13 mg/dl a low C1-INH level 5 mg/dl and an elevated CRP level 1.4 mg/dl. ECHO-abdomen shows the presence of liquid on abdominal cavity. The low levels of C4, low C1-INH levels, increased CRP, use of oral contraceptive pills, also no response to high dose steroid therapy, the diagnosis of HAE was made and she start treatment with intravenous infusion of C1-INH Berinert 20 U/kg of body weight/4 ml/min. She had totally improved with the this therapy. Conclusion: Some times HAE may be misdiagnosed like acute urticaria and the physician must pay attention to the laboratory tests to confirm the proper diagnose and treatment. Background: Angioedema is a sudden, transient swelling of welldemarcated areas of the dermis, subcutaneous tissue, mucosa and submucosal tissue that can occur with or without utricaria. It is now generally accepted that the swelling is mediated by either histamine or bradykinin. Method: We evaluated the clinical characteristics of patients treated for angioedema and determined the risk factors as well as management. We performed a review of 476 patient charts with primary or secondary diagnosis of angioedema over the per-iod between January 2007 and December 2011 at University Hospital of Biaystok, Poland. The chart selection was conducted according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Results: The mean age of patients was 55.4 AE 20.1 years. There was a female predominance (65%) in our study. We found that 53% of the episodes occured without utricaria and 47% with utricaria. In aproximately 55% of cases the probable cause has been determined. Angioedema occurred most commonly in patients treated with NSAIDs, antibiotics ACE inhibitors. Other possible inciting risk factors include such as food, cosmetics, and insect bites. In 45% of cases it was unable to determine the cause. Moreover we have distinguished certain co-morbidities such as hypertension and thyroid diseases that accompanied angioedema more often than the others. Most patients were treated with intravenous steroids and histamine 1 or histamine 2 receptor blockers. Of these patients 7 presented low serum C1-inhibitor concentration and low serum C1-inhibitor activity. Conclusion: The number of angioedemarelated hospital visits had been increasing over the 5 year study period. Angioedema occured more often among female patients. The most common reason for an angioedema episode were drugs. Background: Angioedema (AE) is defined as nonpruritic, nonpitting areas of swelling that involves subcutaneous tissues or mucosa. Pathogenic mechanisms of AE without urticaria are poorly understood. The aim of our study was to characterise all patients with history of recurrent AE without urticaria observed in our outpatient clinic during 2011. Method: Retrospective analysis of clinical data recorded during appointments for AE without urticaria in order to assess gender, age of symptoms onset, personal and family history of atopy, family history of AE, clinical manifestations, triggers, laboratory work-up, treatment, diagnosis and clinical evolution. Results: Eighty-three patients were included, 60% female; median age of symptoms onset 45 years ; 28% atopic; 41% had family history of atopy and one patient of AE. Face was the most common affected site (88%) and respiratory symptoms were present in 22% of patients. 56% were able to identify a trigger and drugs were the most frequent (62%). Thirty-three percent of patients were medicated with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin-receptor antagonists (ARA). These drugs were stopped in 37%, with resolution of AE in 70%. Abnormalities of autoimmune study were found in 13%; autoimmune thyroiditis was the most frequent associated disease (60%) but AE did not improve despite its treatment. Infections were found in 11% and appropriate treatment improved AE in two patients. One patient had low levels of C4 and C1q with normal C1-INH.

Both drugs are widely used in patients with hypertension or ischemic heart disease. ACEIs or ARBs-related angioedema (ACEIs/ARBs-AE) is a well-documented condition, which seems to occur in up to 1% of treated patients. The aim of this study is to describe the clinical aspects of a cohort of ACEIs/ARBs-AE patients. Method: We conducted a retrospective, observational, cohort study of 36 patients diagnosed of ACEIs/ARBs-AE. We studied the items: sex, toxic habits, familial or personal history of angioedema, onset of symptoms, characteristics of attacks (duration, frequency, treatment), antihypertensive involved, response to stop treatment and other relevant pathologies or treatments. Results: Sixty-four percent of patients are male and 28% smokers. Personal history of histaminergic AE and/or chronic urticaria was finded in 33%. Just two patients presented family history of non-histaminergic AE. Median of onset of symptoms was 64 years old. ACEIs-AE were 67% of the total and the drugs most frequently involved were perindopril and ramipril. Just 8% of patients presented ACEIs plus ABRs-AE. Drug was prescribed from 7 days to 20 years before first attack. Attacks on the ORL region were observed in 97% of patients, with 30% of larynx attacks. Duration of attack was 24-96 h, with a frequency from one single attack to 5 episodes/month during several years. Treatment with corticoids and antihistaminics were ineffective in all attacks. Twentyeight percent of patients were treated at least for one attack with Icatibant, C1inhibitor concentrate or tranexamic acid with improvement in every case. Icatibant was especially successful with an improvement of symptoms in 1-2 h. Only 19% of patients presented symptoms until 9 months after stopping drugs involved. Two patients also took gliptines with ACEIs. Two patients' attacks were also facilitated by the use of hormonal therapy to treat prostate cancer. Conclusion: This study shows the clinical characteristics of ACEIs/ARBs-AE, in a French patients' cohort and the efficacy of specific treatments as icatibant or C1Inhibitor concentrate.

Clinically, HAE presents with episodic attacks of swelling that may affect the face, extremities, genitals, gastrointestinal tract and upper airways, namely the larynx, which may lead to throat tightness. Possible precipitant factors include infection, trauma, extreme anxiety and pregnancy; the latter becomes important as estrogen levels significantly rise thereby increasing the risk of crisis. In pregnancy, prophylactic modified androgens, the recommended therapy when swelling attacks are frequent, becomes troublesome due to teratogenecity and are contra-indicated. Therefore, during pregnancy and breast-feeding, alternative therapies must be considered. Case report: The authors present the case of a 38 year-old woman diagnosed with type II HAE at the age of 31. For the last 7 years she has been complaining of sudden and recurrent edema of upper/lower extremities and face mainly associated with minor trauma or dentistry intervention, respectively. Also, chronic abdominal colicky pain was described. This patient started on a daily androgen regimen (danatrol 100 mg) and aminocaproic acid as rescue medication, with complete disease control. At the age of 35, due to pregnancy attempting, this therapy was discontinued and she was started on weekly C1-inhibitor concentrate at Immunoallergology Day Care Unit. During the next 3 years, she suffered from three consecutive spontaneous abortions (before 12 weeks), with no known relation to disease progression. During the last pregnancy, positive antithyroid peroxidase antibodies were found (with normal thyroid function) and the patient was prescribed levothyroxine. Under this therapy combined with biweekly C1 concentrate infusions (due to increasing abdominal crisis), pregnancy was carried out and she delivered a healthy baby by cesarean section. She is now again taking the androgen regimen, with complete crisis remission, not needing C1 concentrate infusions. Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of C1 concentrate during pregnancy. In this particular case, the therapy with levothyroxine appears to have been beneficial, but its specific role in the success of the pregnancy remains unclear. Nevertheless, given the history of Muller reaction grade III and examination results, we decided to administer wasp VIT. We began administering VIT Alutard (ALK-Abell o) in the standard regimen. The patient obtained a prophylactic dose of cetirizine 10 mg and danazol 200 mg on the day of VIT administration. During the treatment the patient has showed no adverse reaction to the VIT and she has had no HAE attacks in connection with this VIT.

The quality of life (QoL) and productivity are affected by these attacks but there is a shortage of data to quantify these effects. Method: A retrospective registry study of Swedish patients with HAE captured by the Sweha-Reg census. Questions related to patient demographics for age and sex and parameters as attack duration, location and severity were included. Inclusion criteria were at least one attack within the last 12 months. Utilities were calculated using EQ5D-5L and patient-reported sick leave was also analyzed to understand the factors responsible for productivity loss in patients with HAE. Patients completed EQ5D-5L questionnaires both for attack-free and acute HAE attack states. The EQ5D-5L answers were analyzed using the British references. Results: From an initial mailing of 139 surveys a total of 103 valid responses were analyzed (74% response rate). Of the 103 patients 54 were females, 12 were under 12 years of age and 7 were 12-18 years of age. During the last 12 months 79% of these patients reported an attack. The total number of attacks reported per patient during 1 year ranged from 1 to 120 (geometric mean 7.23; SE 0.89). The EQ5D-5L scores for acute HAE attacks were associated with a significant utility decrement for all attacks (P < 0.0001). The HAE attack severity showed differences between the 'EQ5D today' and 'EQ5D attack' scores observed for mild (0.07, P < 0.05), moderate (0.369, P < 0.0001) and severe attacks (0.486, P < 0.0001). Increased attack frequency had also a negative impact on patients with HAE. The difference in 'EQ5D today' scores between the two populations with <30 and \u226530 attacks per year suggested that increased attack frequency had a negative impact even on 'between attack' patient quality of life (0.841 vs 0.679, P < 0.02). Thirty out of the 103 reported time off work with 75 days all together. Absenteeism was found to be significantly more likely with increasing severity of attack (P < 0.05). No significant relationship was found between the location of attack and patients\u2032 absenteeism. Conclusion: Results from the Sweha-Reg study provide an insight to the burden on life for patients and society measured as significant impact on QoL and productivity loss that HAE has on patients in Sweden. There is uncertainty, however, as to whether disease severity is correlated with the age at first clinical manifestation. Method: The relationship between age at first clinical manifestation of HAE and frequency of recurrences was retrospectively evaluated for 69 patients (group 1: early onset of symptoms at an age of 0-6 years [n = 47], group 2: later onset of symptoms at an age of >6-18 years [n = 22]). The course of the disease was defined based on the number of attacks per month (severe: \u22654 attacks/ month, moderate: 1 to <4 attacks/month, mild: <1 attack/month). Attacks were treated with human pasteurised C1-INH. Results: Overall, patients with an early onset of symptoms tended to be more likely to suffer from a severe course of the disease. In 6 patients (8.7%), who suffered from the most severe courses of HAE, the first clinical manifestation was at an age of <3 years. Treatment with human pasteurised C1-INH concentrate was efficacious and safe irrespective of disease severity. Conclusion: The severity of the course of HAE seems to be associated with the age at first clinical manifestation. The threat of developing a severe course with early onset of symptoms underlines the importance of early diagnosis in families with a history of HAE to allow for an optimal management of the disease.

Method: A 16-question survey about selfadministration of HAE therapy was sent to 21 centres (in the EU, US and Canada); 10 completed surveys were returned. Survey responses and discussions from the follow-up international HAE expert meeting were used to determine current practice for self-administered HAE therapy. Results: All responding centres offer selfadministration for HAE treatment and have observed that as awareness of this option grows, an increasing number of patients are being offered and are using it. Nine of ten centres provide patient training, however, training programme development varied between countries. Patient and physician benefits from self-administration include earlier treatment which may reduce attack length and severity, lower doses of medication and healthcare resource use as well as improved quality of life. The most widely used products were icatibant (49%), pnfC1-INH (CSLB) [47%] and pnfC1-INH (VP) [4%]. However, pnfC1-INH (VP) was not available in some countries at the time of the survey. Conclusion: An increasing number of patients are being offered and are opting for self-administration therapy. Patient benefits include shorter time to symptom relief and shorter attack duration; physicians benefit from cost savings, a decrease in healthcare use and fewer emergency room visits. The two most widely used products, pnfC1-INH (CSLB) and icatibant, are used equally by patients opting for self-administration; however, national preferences are notable.

Background: Women with atopic dermatitis (AD) often suffer poor self-esteem, difficulties in social interactions, and significant psychological distress, which has an impact on their sexual and reproductive behavior. The aim of this research was to make a detailed assessment of AD impact on quality of life (QOL), with the focus on sexual behavior which contributes to an overall adults' well-being. Method: One hundred and two female patients with AD (without exacerbation), age 16-55 years, were examined at the Occupational Diseases Outpatient Clinic and the Allergology Centre of Saratov Medical University. Russian-language versions of validated Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Dermatology Specific Quality of Life (DSQL) and Women\u2032s Health Questionnaire (WHQ) were used. The impact of AD on QOL was measured on a scale, where higher index represents more significant behavioral problems and lower QOL. Results: Respondents' QOL (according to DLQI and DSQL) was 31.3-65.7% lower in comparison with the best basic indexes of other dermatology patients. AD even without exacerbation decreased work productivity and had adverse effect on daily activities. The major negative impacts of AD were in the areas of socializing, selfesteem and sexual behavior. The most significant decrease of sexual activity was among young females (19-25 years)only 50% were active vs 87% in other age groups. Sexual satisfaction of respondents (standard index of sexual behavior, according to WHQ) was 0.546lower in comparison with average 0.473 regional and 0.4 European indexes (P < 0.05). Self-perception of 'appearance' among patients was the lowestindex of 0.66 vs 0.56 in European and 0.44 in regional populations (P < 0.05). It is important to mention that DSQL proved to be more sensitive than DLQI (on the basis of data comparison of 52 respondents who filled both questionnaires) in describing clinical phases of AD, a better representation of behavioral characteristics and having more QOL scales. Conclusion: Results confirmed statistically significant differences in AD female patients' QOL, as well as sexual behavior, which often depend on the level of patient's self-perception. It is suggested that clinicians should address these QOL issues via: better clinical management and therapy, patient education and being more alert to sexual behavior problems in female AD patients.

A history of AD exacerbation as a result exposure to allergen was obtained. Clinical score of AD (SCORAD) and the number of days with need of topical anti-inflammatory treatment (AITD) were recorded during 1 year.

Results: Up to now, 29 subjects completed the whole study period. APT was positive in 18 patients, mostly to HDM (n = 13). SPT and/or specific IgE were positive in 16 subjects, in most cases to grass pollen (n = 12).

This model is designed to induce prolonged skin swelling reactions thereby enabling the analysis of treatment effects on T cell-mediated pathomechanisms.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1762"}, {"text": "Treatment with topically applied hgd40 significantly and dose-dependently reduced oxazolone-induced skin swelling reactions. Infiltration of inflammatory cells into the skin was also reduced by treatment with hgd40. No adverse effects due to hgd40 or the emulsion were detected, while treatment with dexamethasone, though very effective with respect to skin swelling and infiltration, showed clear adverse effects like scaling and skin atrophy. Conclusion: In summary, targeting of GATA-3 by the DNAzyme hgd40 represents a new and promising therapeutic concept for the topical treatment of allergic skin diseases. Background: Vitamin D deficiency was associated with increased prevalence of atopic dermatitis (AD). Vitamin D supplementation resulted in significant clinical improvements in patients with AD in a few studies. We evaluated the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and the clinical efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in Korean patients with AD. Method: Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] were measured by radioimmunoassay in 102 patients with AD (mean age: 23.2 years, range 4-64 years). Vitamin D deficiency was defined when serum levels of 25(OH)D were <20 ng/ml. Fourteen adult patients with AD were supplemented with 2000 IU of vitamin D (cholecalciferol) daily for 2 months. Results: Vitamin D deficiency was observed 88 (86.3%) of 102 patients with AD. In 14 adult patients with AD, the clinical severity score of atopic dermatitis (SCORAD) significantly decreased from 45.2 AE 27.6 (mean AE SD) at baseline to 30.3 AE 20.5 at 2 months after supplementation of vitamin D (P = 0.01). Mean decrease in SCORAD value at 2 months compared to baseline value was 28.0%. Serum levels of 25(OH)D were significantly increased from 12.4 AE 5.3 to 26.6 AE 7.8 after supplementation of vitamin D (P = 0.001). There was no significant changes in peripheral blood eosinophil counts before (414.7 AE 258.9) and after (351.6 AE 212.2) supplementation of vitamin D (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Vitamin D deficiency was prevalent in Korean patients with AD and vitamin D supplementation resulted in significant clinical improvements.

Further studies and biological effects of this treatment are required in this setting. Omalizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against IgE and has been approved for the treatment of severe asthma in children above 12 years or adults in most of countries. There are few case reports that omalizumab can be successful in severe atopic dermatitis in children above 6 years of age. But there is no report in the literature about the use of omalizumab in children under 6 years of age. Here we emphasized the successful treatment of omalizumab in a 4-year old child with severe atopic dermatitis who did not respond to the conventional treatments. The patient partial responded to the systemic steroid and cyclosporine. Case: Four-year old girl was diagnosed with severe atopic dermatitis since 14 months of age in our outpatient department. She had a concomitant food allergy and mild asthma without aeroallergen sensitisation. She was previously treated conventionally including emollients, topical steroid and topical calcineurin inhibitors but her lesions did not respond. She had benefit from systemic steroid treatment but steroids were interrupted because of suppressed hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Thereupon cyclosporine treatment was given to her. She had benefit from cyclosporine treatment but the severity of atopic dermatitis increased quickly after cessation of cyclosporine therapy. Because of long time using of cyclosporine than suggested by literature we decided to find out an efficient and safe systemic treatment option for controlling her dermatitis. Finally she was treated with 150 mg of omalizumab subcutaneously, repeated at 2week intervals. Absolute eosinophil count was 500 and total IgE level was 216 kU/l at the beginning of the treatment. After three months of omalizumab, her SCO-RAD index was decreased from 71.5 to 44.6 (37.6% reduction according to the initial) and her treatment is still continuing without need of any topical steroid. Although she was monitored closely there were no potential adverse effects of treatment. Conclusion: This is the youngest case demonstrating the success of omalizumab treatment in severe atopic dermatitis in childhood.

It is considered as second-line therapy in chronic urticaria. Method: We describe the case of a 40year-old woman referred to our clinic with daily pruritic wheals, periorbital and lips swelling, difficulty in swallowing and episodic dypsnea of 1 year duration. The lesions lasted more than 24 h and resolved without sequels. The urticaria activity score was (UAS) 6. She had a history of epilepsy, anemia, hypothyroidism and celiac disease. The patient was treated with daily anti-H1-antihistamines (maximum doses) and periodic cycles of corticosteroids with no adequate control. Results: Skin tests were negative from aeroallergens and commercial extracts of food, latex, Anisakis, profilin and peach LTP. Laboratory: complement (CH50, C3, C4, C1-inhibitor), renal and liver function, antithyroid and antinuclear antibodies, stool parasite exam, hepatitis B and C serology, immunoglobulins and thorax Xrays were all within the normal range.

We performed a skin biopsy to examine pathologic tissue, and collected specimens by nasopharyngeal swab specimens as well as stool and blood specimens for microbiological examination using MRC-5 (human embryo lung fibroblast) cells. Results: Laboratory tests revealed the following findings: white blood cell (WBC) count, 21 200/ll (neutrophilis 76%), total protein, 5.6 g/dl, albumin, 2.8 g/dl, FDP 12.8 lg/dl, D-dimer, 9.1 lg/dl, and C reactive protein, 13.55 mg/dl.

At first, we thought that the patient had Kawasaki disease, but a skin biopsy revealed early lesion of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Permeation of lymphocytes and histocytes with nuclear dusts (products of the destruction of neutrophil nuclei), eosinophiles and neutrophils had occurred around the superficial dermal blood vessels, and leakage of the blood cells from the capillary vessels was observed. These findings led to a diagnosis of HUVS. We therefore treated her with prednisolone 2 mg/kg/day, gradually reducing the dose after the urticaria had disappeared. We isolated coxsackievirus type A9 (CA9) from the all samples (nasal fluid, blood, and stool). The neutralising antibody against CA9 in the convalescent phase serum was significantly more elevated than that in the acute phase serum. Conclusion: Infection by the coxsackievirus type A9 may cause HUVS. Introduction: Urticarial vasculitis (UV) is characterised by pruritic, burning or painfully raised, superficial, erythematous or edematous, circumscribed wheals, foci of purpura and induration. The individual urticarial lesions last frequently more than 24 h and leave a residual transient hyperpigmentation. Urticarial vasculitis is most commonly idiopathic and it may be systemic or localised to the skin. Case: Seventeen year-old boy admitted our hospital because of rashes on his various body region, angioedema and edema on his left arm. He had no fever, weakness and other symptoms of systemic involvement. On his physical examination he had some erythematous, painfully rashes without wheal formation on his palm, soles of the right feet and left elbow. Left arm had diffuse minimal edema but there was no hyperemia and pulselessness. Other physical examination was normal.

Genes were selected based on their role in the glucocorticoid signaling pathway or a previously reported association with asthma. Two outcome parameters were used to reflect exacerbations: 1 asthma-related hospital visits and 2 short course(s) of oral corticosteroid (OCS) use in the previous year. The model was adjusted for age, sex and treatment step. ORs were meta-analyzed assuming random effects with the inverse variance weighing method. Q-values were calculated to account for multiple testing. Identified associations were replicated in a fourth study: CAMP (n = 172, age: 5-12 years, USA). CAMP was included in a second meta-analysis to test the robustness of the findings. Results: In a meta-analysis of PACMAN, BREATHE and PAGES two SNPs in ST13 were associated with severe exacerbations despite corticosteroid treatment. An additive genetic model was assumed. ST13 SNP rs138335 increased the risk of asthma-related hospital visits (OR = 1.35 per G allele; 95%CI 1.07-1.70, OR: 1.35, P = 0.01, q = 0.25). Rs138337 had a similar effect (OR = 1.36 per G allele; 95% CI: 1.11-1.67, P = 0.003, q = 0.11).

The two SNPs were not associated with risk of severe exacerbation in CAMP. However, when CAMP was included in the meta-analysis the two SNPs were significantly associated with both outcomes. In the meta-analysis of the four studies rs138335 increased the risk of hospital visits (OR: 1.28 per G allele; 95% CI: 1.03-1.59, P = 0.02, q = 0.36), as did rs138337 (OR: 1.31 per G allele; 95% CI: 1.07-1.59, P = 0.007, q = 0.19).

Socioeconomic status: the following characteristics were used to define socioeconomic status: level of education of father and mother. Information was also collected on their occupation and income. Maternal and paternal diagnosed as asthma, or other allergic conditions were examined as a risk for developing childhood asthma. Indicators of disease severity including symptom scores, attack frequency, medication use, hospital attendance, and life threatening bronchospasm were correlated to socioeconomic status, smoking and the family history of allergic diseases. Results: Asthma was common among males (62.2%), most of them lived in poor rural areas. Only 10% of patients met the requirements for acceptable control, while 22% had intermediate control, and 68% had unacceptable asthma control. Children from families in lower income had poorer control. Impact of socioeconomic status; parental education and their jobs; there was a decreasing risk of asthma with good control with increasing socioeconomic status. The OR for asthma was 2.33 (95% CI 2.17-5.66) comparing the highest and the lowest socioeconomic groups. Parental smoking history, Asthma in general positively related to household smoke exposure.

Background: The importance of quality of life in health care practice and research is steadily growing and in the last decades an increasing effort has been made to understand the impact of atopic disease on Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) in children and adolescents. Purpose: To assess the HRQL of adolescents with controlled atopic disease and compare the results with healthy controls in an urban area of northern Portugal. Material and methods: Cross-sectional study involving adolescents (10-18 years old) with controlled atopic disease from hospital outpatient clinic and healthy students. A self-administered generic questionnaire (KIDSCREEN-52 \u00e2 ) was used. A confidence level of 0.05 was considered. Results: Of 364 participants, 122 with controlled atopic disease (62asthma, 27rhinitis, 30asthma and rhinitis, 3food allergy) and 242 healthy controls. The age median was 13 years in the atopic disease group and 15 years in the healthy group. There was a significant male predominance in the atopic disease group (62.9% vs 51.3%, P = 0.034). Compared to healthy controls, atopic adolescents presented lower HRQL scores in the physical well-being (P = 0.015) and social support and peers (P = 0.038) domains, but higher scores in the psychological well-being (P = 0.014), moods and emotions (P = 0.005) and selfperception (P = 0.004) domains. Despite there was no significant difference in the school environment domain, we found a higher school retention rate among atopic adolescents (P = 0.027). There were no significant differences in any domain comparing asthma and rhinitis groups or comparing adolescents with one atopic disease and those with asthma and rhinitis. Conclusion: Similarly to previous studies, controlled atopic adolescents presented lower HRQL scores concerning to physical well-being and peers relationship. Unexpectedly, they presented higher HRQL scores related to psychological well-being, emotions and self-perception issues. This can be explained by a good disease control or reflect a limitation of the study by using a generic instrument. We were unable to demonstrate a deleterious effect of atopic disease in HRQL regarding family relationship or economic issues. Further studies could contribute to the long-term implementation of measures to improve the HRQL of adolescents with atopic disease. Aim: Evaluation of total IgE and serum levels of immunoglobulins A, M, G in chil-dren with recurrent wheezing associated with ENT. Method: The study included two groups of children aged 6-12 years. The study group was consisted of 68 children (13.7%: 95% CI 11.1 to 16.6) with recurrent wheezing associated with ENT (otorhinolaryngology) and control group of 544 children (86 3%: 95% CI 83.4 to 89.9) with recurrent wheezing solitary. The total concentration of IgA, IgM, IgG and serum level of IgE was determined by ELISA. The accumulated material was processed in the database of Statistical Epi Info program. Results: The serum level of IgE in the study group permitted us to found the increased concentration (174.5 AE 37.6 ME /ml) in children with recurrent wheezing associated with ENT disorders compared with children only with recurrent wheezing (83.6 AE 7, 6ME/ml, P < 0.02). The level of IgA (0.8 AE 0.1 mg/ml) has tendency to be reduced in the study group (children from the control group -0.9 AE 0.04 mg/ml, P > 0.05). The serum concentration of IgM in the basic group does not differ from the values of control group (1.74 AE 0.1 mg/ml, 1.73 AE 0.1 mg/ml, respectively, P > 0.05). It was highlighted increased levels of IgG equal to 10.8 AE 0.5 mg/ml at the basic group (7.2 AE 0.1 mg/ml, P < 0.01 in children in the control group). Conclusion: Humoral immune changes are confirmed by increasing levels of IgG in children with recurrent wheezing associated with ENT diseases which are influenced by the negative impact of chronic infectious process, allergic mechanisms are presented by increased values of total IgE. 1788 Prematurity, low birth weight, cesarean, and pediatric allergy, their role in chronic respiratory disease and the bronchial hyperresponsiveness Pinilla, VH; Baracchini, MA; Gomez, J Neumus, Immunology, Allergy and Pediatric Respiratory Center, Quilmes, Argentina Background: In a retrospective study that included children from birth to age ten, we investigated the association between low birth weight, prematurity and cesarean section compared with the control group and role in the hygiene hypothesis. Method: Period of investigation from 2002 to 2012. Of 173 children were monitored with discernment exclusion, compared with the control group with clinic, biochemical respiratory function and skin prick test were used, complemented with X-ray diagnosis, allergy personal family history. Conclusion: Prematurity, low birth weight, and cesarean section, they are linked with chronic respiratory disease and/or airway hyperresponsiveness in postnatal life. Perinatal events, may play a role in the lack of response to maintenance therapy or rescue for bronchial obstruction at various stimuli, opening one of the paths to the allergic march. So it is important to identify this risk group from the birth because it allows us to anticipate with therapeutic agents, the changes in the airway and in this way eliminate or decrease the impacts and as a consequence a better quality of life. Background: Asthma is the most common chronic childhood disease responsible for a significant impairment in physical, emotional, psychological and spiritual aspects of life. Currently, there is a controversy regarding risk factors of asthma, specially birth-related factors. The aim of this study was to evaluate relationship between asthma and birth-related factors. Method: In this case-control study, 30 children between 3 and 12 years old with asthma were selected as the case group, and 90 non-asthmatic children were included in the control group after matching based on age and sex. Data about birth-related factors affecting asthma for both groups was collected and compared between two groups. Results: The results showed that the majority of the children in the case group were boy and born by cesarean section. There were significant differences in factors such as pre-term born (OR = 2.53 CI 95% 0/98-6.75), family history of asthma (OR = 3.52 CI 95%: 1.03-10.16) and resi-dency in the city (OR: 16.28 CI 95%: 5. 99-44.28) between two groups.

Conclusion: Rhinitis symptoms in childhood change with age and so does IgE sensitisation. Atopic dermatitis and asthma often coexist with rhinitis. The congestive symptoms seem related to younger age; they are less related to IgE sensitisation, and/or atopic dermatitis, while mixed symptoms relate to IgE sensitisation. Background: The purpose of this study was to investigate the status of cognitive functions in adolescents with persistent (long-lasting) allergic rhinitis (PAR) to work out a correction strategy. Method: Of 108 adolescents aged 14-15 years with PAR were included in the study. Clinical examination, allergic tests, blood oxygen concentration measurement were used. Cognitive functions characteristics/indices, including memory, attention, perception, analytic-synthetic processes, and delicate motor activity (over ten metrics in total) were investigated using quantitative computer-based tests on the device 'Psychomat' developed by the Research Institute of Medical Instrumentation under RAMS (Russia). Moreover, the quality of life in the study group was measured using questionnaires. Results: PAR in adolescents was associated with deficiency of cognitive functions (memory capacity by 10.7%, short-term visual memory by 27.4%, attention concentration by 51.5%, attention level by 56.2%, attention switching by 20.7%, decision-making efficiency by 63.2%, maximum speed of motive reactions by 98.4%, delicate coordination by 15.3%, efficiency of motive-coordination activity by 61.1%) and deterioration of the quality of life including sleep disturbance, variable moods, poorer school performance. Intranasal GCS mometasone furoate (Nasonex) was administrated to the study group for 4 weeks and proved highly effective in relieving AR symptoms and improving cognitive functions. Conclusion: Measurement of quantitative cognitive function indices in adolescents with PAR can be used to determine the degree of cognitive deficiency. The role of computer-based testing of cognitive functions in measuring treatment effectiveness was determined. The link between PAR and social disadaptation was identified. After a 4-week period of treatment, cognitive functions in 89% of the adolescents studied normalised or became closer to the norm.

This is of special interest regarding the growing application of lactic acid bacteria in combination with a mixture of non-digestible oligosaccharides in prevention and treatment of diseases. Aim of the study was to investigate the impact of different bacterial strains in combination with oligosaccharides on cytokine release by human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDC). Method: Immature MoDC prepared from peripheral blood monocytes of healthy non-atopic volunteers were stimulated with a Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strain in different concentrations in the presence of different combinations of GOS (galacto oligosaccharides), FOS (fructose oligosaccharides) and AOS (pectin derived acidic oligosaccharides). IL-12p70 and IL-10 release was analyzed after 24 h in cell-free supernatants. Results: Incubation of MoDC with different concentrations of the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains in combination with neutral or acidic oligosaccharides revealed that GOS/FOS (9:1) and GOS/FOS/AOS (9:1:2) had a significant additive effect on bacteria-induced IL-10 release by human MoDC, while the ability of these oligosaccharides to increase IL-12p70 production was less pronounced. Conclusion: Enhanced release of IL-10 by bacteria-treated human MoDC in the presence of GOS/FOS and GOS/FOS/AOS suggests specific immune regulatory capacities in vitro.

Cooperation between NGOs, the scientific community and authorities is mandatory. Background: Allergic diseases (AD) are increasing in frequency and severity, and represent a global health problem. The EAACI reported that about 25% of children in Europe show allergic reactions to inhalant or food allergens. Although genetic predisposition is an important risk factor, the rise in prevalence happened within a too short time period to be explained by genetic changes in the population. There is convincing evidence that lifestyle factors (e.g. smoking, diet, and air pollution) are important contributors to allergy risk. Prenatal and early life exposures have attracted attention to study the mechanisms involved in the environmentdriven epidemic of AD. The underlying molecular mechanisms are still unclear, but epigenetic changes are a plausible mechanism to alter gene expression, which can establish a different phenotype and thereby altering the risk of AD later in life. Therefore, we hypothesise that prenatal exposures (e.g. air pollution and mother's diet) affect the fetus by changing the intra-uterine environment, leading to epigenetic changes that can influence a child's risk for AD later in life. Method: The current study is embedded in an ongoing birth cohort follow-up in Flanders (Flanders Environment and Health Surveys FLEHS1). Questionnaires (asking for e.g. allergy status, life style, diet) and blood samples are available from 595 mother/child pairs with children followed until 10 years of age.

During sting challenge patients were kept under surveillance by two anesthesiologists and one allergologist. Details on how to treat anaphylactic reactions were left to the discretion of the stand-by anesthesiologist. Severity grade of allergic reactions before starting the emergency therapy was classified according to Ring (I, generalised skin reaction; II, moderate cardiovascular and/or pulmonary symptoms; III, anaphylactic shock; IV, near fatal reactions). Results: Of 51 cases had mild (grade I), 41 moderate (II), and 7 severe (III) SAR. Most patients received an intravenous therapy including H1-blocking antihistamines (n = 86) and corticosteroids (n = 67), in part combined with H2-blocking antihistamines (n = 36). Only four patients (8.3% of patients with a grade II or III SAR) required an epinephrine therapy which was either provided intravenously (two cases) or via inhalation (two cases). In 90% of the patients systemic symptoms relieved shortly after medical interventions had been started; in 10% drug therapy had to be repeated or extended. Thirteen patients did not receive medical treatment. All patients recovered without sequelae. Conclusion: More than 90% of patients who had developed a grade II or III SAR during sting challenge recovered although no epinephrine was given. Our findings do not support current guidelines recommend-ing an epinephrine therapy for all SARs of a severity grade of II or higher. Prospective studies appear to be justified to further elucidate the importance of epinephrine as a first line drug therapy for severe SAR.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1820"}, {"text": "Coexistence of autoimmunological diseases does not affect safety of immunotherapy in hymenoptera allergic patients Kempinski, K; Kita, K; Niedoszytko, M; Gorska, L; Jassem, E Allergology and Pneumonology, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland Background: Coexisting autoimmunological diseases are believed to be associated with adverse course of immunotherapy in hymenoptera sting allergic patients. The objective of our analysis was to check if this kind of correlation is to be found in our group of patients. Method: A retrospective, statistical analysis of our Department database, describing hymenoptera allergic patients treated with immunotherapy, was done. Results: There were 282 patients allergic to hymenoptera venom treated with immunotherapy in the Department in the years 2002-2012. The data on 201 (109 women, 92 men in the age of 18-78 (mean 43)) were included in the further analysis due to the complete data on the follow up.

Safety: no patient showed adverse systemic reactions; 27 patients showed large local reactions only during the initial phase (13% per patient). Efficacy: 66 patients were field re-stung by VC, for a total of 117 stings; out of them 19 were large local reactions and 93 negative, while five patients showed a systemic reaction (generalised urticaria/erythema); efficacy was 95.7%. Following discontinuation of VIT, 15 patients were re-stung, for a total of 17 stings: 16 were negative and one patient presented large local reaction.

At present, it remains unclear to what extent the presence of eosinophils, eosinophilic mucin (EM) and fungal hyphae (FH) in secretions influence the clinical outcome and recurrence of disease after ESS. Objective: By delineating CRS groups and subgroups based on the finding of eosinophils, EM and FH, differences in the frequency of recurrent disease after ESS over a longer period of time were investigated. Method: A prospective mono-centre study including 221 CRS patients who were unresponsive to medical treatment and underwent ESS, was performed. All tissue and sinonasal secretions were microscopically examined for the presence of eosinophils, EM and FH. Patients were followed for 3 years after surgery. Recurrence was defined according to the EPOS clinical control assessment, based on nasal endoscopy, symptoms and the need for systemic treatment. Results: In total, 96 CRSwNP and 125 CRSsNP patients were included. Tissue eosinophils were found in 78% of CRSwNP patients compared to 42% in CRSsNP. Eosinophilic mucin was observed in 52% of the CRSwNP group vs 20% of the CRSsNP group. Furthermore, secretion analysis revealed FH in 6.8% of CRS. Recurrence in the total group was 22% over 3 years. CRSwNP patients with tissue eosinophilic involvement showed a recurrence rate of 32%. When the airway mucus secretions were positive for EM the recurrence rate was even 51%. Conclusion: The presence of eosinophils in the tissue or secretions greatly increases the risk of recurrent disease in CRSwNP patients. The finding of tissue eosinophilia and EM in the collected sinonasal airway mucus secretions provides valuable information regarding the clinical outcome and the increased likelihood of CRS recurrence after ESS, whereas the finding of FH does not.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF2": {"text": "K\u00f6 se, S \u00df ; Senger, SS; C \u00df avdar, G; G\u20ac ol, B Tepecik Educational and Research Hospital, Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Allergy and Immunology Clinic, Izmir, Turkey", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF3": {"text": "Lollobrigida, V 1 ; Zicari, AM 1 ; Tubili, F 1 ; Occasi, F 1 ; Bardanzellu, F 1 ; Celani, C 1 ; Nebbioso, M 1 ; Duse, M 1 ; Cesoni Marcelli, A 2 1 Immunology and Allergology, Policlinico Umberto I Hospital, Sapienza, Rome, Italy; 2 Pediatrics, Policlinico Umberto I Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF4": {"text": "Calder\u00f3 n, OM 1 ; Del Pozo, V 2 ; Bobolea, I 1 ; Fiandor, A 1 ; Quirce, S 1 ; Caba\u00f1as, R 1 1 La Paz University Hospital Research, Allergy, Madrid, Spain; 2 Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain Background: Hypersensitivity reactions to Iodinated Contrast Media (ICM) may be Ig E mediated. Cardio-respiratory arrest by ICM has been rarely reported. Method: A 71-years-old patient was referred to us from Pulmonology department for study of allergy to ICM. Personal history of ex-smoker, high blood pressure, hyperuricemia, COPD, Sleep Apnea Syndrome treated with CPAP. No atopy history. Habitual treatment: Olmesartan/ amlodipino 40/5 mg 1-0-0, atorvastatin 80 mg 0-0-1, salmeterol/fluticasone 50/ 500 ucg 1-0-1, tiotropium bromide 0-1-0, aspirin 100 mg 0-1-0. He felt warmth in forearm with subsequent extension with intense burning sensation, fading, malaise, pallor, vomiting, flushing, sweating immediately after administration of Iomeprol 120 cc i.v. during a CT examination for pulmonary nodules in study. He had cardiopulmonary arrest, requiring CPR maneuvers, admission to intensive care unit, with tracheal intubation for 48 h, administration of inotropics in continue perfursion, corticosteroids and antibiotics i.v. He had been previously submitted to various CT examinations with ICM, five times in 2 years without any reaction Results:Allergological study: Skin tests: prick test to latex: negative. ICM: Iomeprol [1/10] prick: highly positive, Iohexol [1/ 10] Intradermal test (IDT): positive. Iobitridol, Iodinaxol prick and IDT were negative; Amidotrizoato prick: negative. Total serum IgE: 140 KU/l, Triptase at baseline: 3.23 mcg/l, specific IgE: Anisakis: 0, 74 KU/l. The basophil activation test (BAT by Baso Flow Ex \u00e2 ) was negative to: Iobitridol, Iodinaxol and Amidotrizoato. However, it had a highly positive result to Iomeprol (>90% of activated basophils, cut-off values for drugs \u22655%) and positive to Iohexol (9%). Conclusion: We present a case of Anaphylactic Shock (anaphylaxis grade IV) induced by ICM 'Iomeprol' with prick test and BAT positive. Cross-reactivity to Ioh-exol has been detected by IDT and BAT. It happens to be a good correlation between skin tests and BAT. Repeated exposure to ICM seems to be a predisposing factor to ICM allergy.

A clinical suspicion of SNAS is confirmed by an improvement of the symptoms after a low nickel diet. Method: In the period between June 2006 and December 2012, 250 (240 f-10 m; mean age, 31 AE 26 + 13.04 years; range, 18-64 years) because of a clinical suspicion of SNAS, underwent a nickel patch-test according to the International Contact Dermatitis Research Group Guidelines. Therefore, after confirming cutaneous sensitisation to nickel, a low nickel diet was prescribed with foods which are generally tolerated by patients with SNAS while foods which usually cause exacerbation of SNAS had to be avoided. The low nickel diet caused clinical improvement of symptoms correlated to SNAS in 221 patients, who underwent an oral nickel provocation test in our allergy outpatient Unit. The test was positive in 198 patients (189 f and 9 m) and negative in 13 (12 f -1 m). Nickel Oral Hyposensitising Treatment (NOHT) was started in 189 patients, following an up-dosing schedule from 0.1 to 500 ng.

Recent findings suggest that IgGassociated inhibitory activity like IgE blocking activity or IgE facilitated allergen binding are correlated to the clinical success of treatment. We compared the IgG 4 levels during the first and second years of treatment in patients desensitised with three different high-dose preparations: a sublingual unmodified allergen, a subcutaneous allergoid, and a subcutaneous recombinant grass pollen allergen preparation. Method: Prospectively planned analyses of serum IgG 4 levels were performed using the Allergopharma ELISA in three doubleblind, placebo controlled clinical trials. For randomisation patients (18-60 years) had to have a history of hay fever, positive skin prick and conjunctival challenge test results, serum IgE to grass pollen allergens (EAST class \u22652), and relevant symptoms during the baseline grass pollen season (BL). Serum specific IgG 4 levels were determined before and after 1& 2 treatment years. Results: Whilst for sublingual immunotherapy moderate increases in mean IgG 4 levels from [lg/l]: 64 (BL) to 418 after 1 year and 1971 after 2 years were found, substantial increases of IgG 4 levels occurred in subcutaneous immunotherapy using allergoid: [lg/l] 942 (BL), 61765 (year 1), 73433 (year 2) and recombinant phleum preparation [lg/l]: 539 (BL), 48631 (year 1), 352942 (year 2). There were no relevant changes of serum IgG 4 levels in the placebo groups. Conclusion: The induction of the serum specific IgG 4 antibody response appears to depend on the route, dose, and immunogenic properties of specific immunotherapy preparations. Although immune reactive activity to a certain extent for the high-dose sublingual preparation was observed, both SCIT preparations were more effective.

Patients with HAE are at risk of mainly subcutaneous and submucosal oedema, laryngeal oedema being the most dangerous. Patients with anaphylaxis are at risk of cardiovascular collapse during systemic allergic reaction. Our patient was diagnosed with HAE several years ago. She experienced symptoms of erythema, urticaria, chills, fever, dysarthria, shortness of breath and faints in 2011 after hornet sting. Consequently she was hospitalised at the Intensive Care Unit and an examination for allergy to insect stings was recommended. Method: We performed skin prick tests, examined specific IgE and IgG4 to venom extracts and their components and basophile activation test (BAT) with venom extracts was performed as well. Results: Skin prick tests to venom extracts were negative; IgE to wasp venom 1.361 kIU/l; IgE to bee venom 1.811 kIU/l; IgE to rVes v5 2.3 kIU/l; IgE to rVes v1 0.401 kIU/l; IgE to rApi m1 0.00 kIU/l; IgE to CCD 0.001; BAT wasp venom 17%; BAT bee venom 11%.

Conclusion: We confirmed allergy to wasp venom and we recommended venom immunotherapy (VIT) for this patient.

Attacks can be serious; the risk of dying from airway obstruction, has been estimated at 30%. In Turkey, the mean time between the onset of symptoms and the established diagnosis of the disease is as long as 26 years. One can argue that this unacceptable delay may arise from the relatively low level of awareness of the disease between doctors. In this study, we aimed to investigate the level of awareness of the doctors on HAE. Method: A questionnaire consisting of 20 questions was performed in 155 persons randomly selected from internal medicine specialists participated in the XIV. National Congress of Internal Medicine in Turkey. In this questionaire, the basic questiones such as 'Have you ever heard of HAE?', 'Have you ever faced with a patient diagnosed with HAE?' as well as more specified questions like 'What is the name of the deficient protein in HAE?' were included. AE 9.02 years, range 24-64. The majority of the doctors (145 of 155, 93.4%) reported that they were aware of the presence of HAE and 42.8% of them (66 of 155), had followed at least one time a patient with HAE (67.7% of the doctors working in university vs 36.4% of the doctors in state hospitals, P = 0.002). 38.6% of the doctors did not have any idea about the pathogenesis of the disease. Only 22.2% knew that HAE was due to C1-INH deficiency. Doctors working in university facilities were more familiar with the pathogenesis of the disease than doctors in other institutions (38.7% vs 18%, P = 0.014). HAE was more frequently heard (known) among younger doctors (35.98 AE 8.23 vs 45.70 AE 13.26, P = 0.047). 62% of all doctors stated that urticaria could have accompanied attacks in HAE. Only 6% of the responders knew that the screening test for HAE was C4 level measurement. The screening test was also known more correctly among newer graduated doctors (9.87 AE 7.31 vs 12.99 AE 9.04, P = 0.033). A percentage as small as 6% reported that C1-Inh levels or function had to be checked for a correct diagnosis. Conclusion: Our study showed that because of lack of awareness of the clinicians about HAE, the patients can be left undiagnosed for many years. Therefore, a national educational programme is required.

Among them, anti-IgE antibody deserves special interest. It is found that the etiologic factors of non immune form of chronic urticaria are: physical, psychological, infectious, autoimmune, etc. and various natural factors. Today, some doctors pick out so-called 'idiopathic chonic urticaria.' It is doubtful that the bases of this type of urticaria are autoimmune processes.Objective: To study antibodies against IgE receptors in patients with idiopathic chronic urticaria. Study Group: The investigation was made on 67 patients with chronic urticaria, 41 women and 26 men, from 18 to 54 years old.Diagnosis was made with a comprehensive study of patients. Among them were: medical history, the whole range of instrumental and laboratory researches, selected for each of them separately. Analysis of these results showed that 21 patients -(31%) from 67 patients had a idiopathic chronic urticaria, almost one-third. Patients were divided into two groups: chronic urticaria (G1) and idiopathic chronic urticaria (G2). In control group (G3) were 11 women and seven men, age 15-42 years, who did not have various allergic diseases. Method: All 86 patients were studied on carrying anti-IgE receptor antibody. For this ELISA kit was used, which sensitivity was from 0 to 200 ng/ml. Plasma were taken for analysis of acute period of the disease before treatment. Results: G3 of Anti-IgE receptor ab amount were 0-5 ng/ml. In groups G2 105-362 (m = 275 AE 23, 8, P < 0.001) ng/ ml; in G1of 21-47 (m = 34 AE 4, 5, P < 0.035) ng/ml. Conclusion: Results show that in the group with idiopathic chronic urticaria 'autoimmune' indexses were statistically significant. This fact increases our suspicion that 'idiopathic chronic urticaria' is not always a truly idiopathic. 1731 Acute urticaria presenting in the emergency room of a general hospital Bussolino, C 1 ; Losappio, L 2 ; Cannito, CD 2 ; Carpentiere, R 2 ; Di Biase, M 3 ; Pizzimenti, S 1 ; Raie, A 1 ; Badiu, I 1 ; Heffler, E 1 ; Rolla, G 1 1 Allergy and Clinical Immunology -Department of Medical Sciences, University of Torino, Torino, Italy; 2 Emergency Department, 'Dimiccoli' Hospital, Barletta, Italy; 3 Cardiology Department, University of Foggia, Foggia, Italy Background: Many patients with acute urticaria are treated by their family physician, but acute urticaria is a common disorder that often prompts patients to seek treatment in the Emergency Department (ED) . There are few data on acute urticaria presenting in emergency department. The aim of this study was to provide the demographic and clinical data of patients presenting with acute urticaria at the Emergency Department of Dimiccoli Hospital, the only acute care general hospital of Barletta, a 90 000 inhabitants town of South Italy. The predictive factors of the length of stay in the ED had also been investigated. Method: The ED patients database was searched for urticaria by ICD-9 code and by keywords in the diagnosis description. All the medical records of the identified patients, in a period of 1 year of observation, were reviewed and the length of stay in ED was noted. Results: A total of 459 patients (226 female, mean age 35 years) were admitted to ED with acute urticaria, out of a total of 44 112 attendances in 2011, corresponding to 1.01% of total ED visits and to 1.2 admission per day. The mean length of stay was 155 AE 74.9 min (range 20-420 min). Angioedema was present in 139 cases (30.3%), fever in 55 (12%) and associated symptoms in 73 cases, 29 of them fulfilled the criteria of anaphylaxis. Triggers could be identified in 193 cases (42%): drugs in 20.7%, followed by insects bites (10.2%), foods (7.4%) and contact urticaria in 3.7%. Patients were treated mainly with i.v. glucocorticoid (93%) and parenteral anti-histamine drugs (78%). Oral therapy was seldom administered Only one patient received oral glucocorticoid and 40 patients (8.7%) oral anti-histamine drug.Adrenaline was used only in 15 out of 29 cases of anaphylaxis (52%). Anaphylaxis (P < 0.002), food (P < 0.05) and drugs (P < 0.05) were significant and independent predictive factors of the length of stay in ED at multivariate regression analysis. Conclusion: Patients with acute urticaria are frequently referred to the emergency room, but only in a few cases urticaria is associated with severe allergic manifestations. Drug and food hypersensitivity, together with anaphylaxis, are the best predictors of the length of stay in ED.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 42, "end": 46, "text": "1719", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2033, "end": 2037, "text": "1731", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2260, "end": 2263, "text": "1 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2691, "end": 2695, "text": "(ED)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Poster Session 78"}, {"text": "Chronic urticaria associated with primary biliary cirrhosis in a patient with normal liver function tests Background: Chronic urticaria (CU) is a disorder defined as the presence of pruritus and urticaria over a duration of 6 weeks or longer. Currently, an etiology for CU is identified in only 5-20% of patients. According to recent ABIM and AAAAI Choosing Wisely Guidelines, clinical history and physical examination are necessary for the diagnosis of CU but routine laboratory evaluation is discouraged. We present a 44-year-old female with CU and normal initial laboratory values. However, further evaluation led to the diagnosis of Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC). Case presentation: The patient is a 44year-old female with a history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis presenting with daily pruritus and urticaria for 6 weeks. The rash was refractory to treatment with OTC antihistamines but resolved after starting methylprednisolone therapy. Because the rash recurred one week after discontinuation of corticosteroid therapy, additional laboratory evaluation was pursued. The patient was started on colchicine and experienced complete resolution of her pruritus and urticaria. Results: Initial laboratory work-up demonstrated a normal CBCD, ESR and negative histamine release assay, but her thyroperoxidase antibody and CRP were both elevated at 306 IU/ml and 0.69 mg/dl respectively. Following her second visit, hepatic panel, including GGT, were within normal limits, however the ANA panel was mildly positive at 1:40 and anti-mitochondrial titer (AMA) was positive at Background: Psoriasis is a chronic immunologically mediated genetically determined dermatosis. Hyperactivity of the immune system and metabolic disorders are known to be its essential pathogenic mechanisms. The aim of our study is to find out the efficacy of S-adenosyl methionine and c-glutamyltryptophan in a complex therapy of psoriasis. Method: Twenty-six patients of 20 to 50 years old presented with 1 to 5-year moderate psoriasis history were under study. The mean PASI index was 53. Eleven patients were given 800 mg of S-adenosyl methionine every other day (total 14 doses). Another ten patients were given two 7-day courses of 1 ml of c-glutamyltryptophan intramuscularly, with a 2-day interval between them. Five patients were given c-glutamyltryptophan and S-adenosyl methionine simultaneously. All these patients also applied zinc pyrithione cream on the lesions two times a day. The assessment of the course effectiveness was made on the 7th and the 28th day. Results: On the 7th day the mean PASI index was noted to have decreased by 15% in S-adenosyl methionine taking group, it appeared to have decreased by 26% in cglutamyltryptophan taking group. In patients taking both c-glutamyltryptophan and S-adenosyl methionine PASI index has decreased by 40%. On the 28th day of therapy in one patient of the latter group the regressing stage of psoriasis was noted, with the mean PASI index being 5. Marked clinical effect was also registered in the group of patients taking c-glutamyltryptophan, with the mean PASI index being 20. The course with S-adenosyl methionine showed less effect, with the mean PASI index being 35. Conclusion: Thus, the simultaneous course of c-glutamyltryptophan and S-adenosyl methionine showed maximal clinical effect when given with conventional therapy. These patients demonstrated maximal remission duration for a year.

Besides its pro-fibrotic property, TGF-b 1 has antiinflammatory activity related with its induction of T regulatory cells. There is conflicting data concerning the role of TGF-b 1 in the pathogenesis of airway hyperreactivity (AHR). Objective: To investigate the role of exhaled TGF-b 1 and interleukin (IL)-4 in EIB in asthmatic children. Method: Fifty-six asthmatic children were evaluated with exercise challenge and exhaled TGF-b 1 and IL-4 levels. Exhaled breath condensate was collected before and 30 min after exercise challenge. TGF-b 1 and IL-4 concentrations were determined using a specific immunoassay kit. Results: At baseline, no significant difference in EBC TGF-b 1 levels was found between the EIB group (n = 25) and the non-EIB asthmatics (n = 31). After exercise challenge, a significant difference in EBC TGF-b 1 levels was found between the EIB group and the non-EIB asthmatics (106.4 pg/ml [91.4-126.4] 4-126.4] ; P = 0.56). Preexercise TGF-b 1 levels strongly correlated with ACT score, baseline FEV 1 %, and IL-4 levels (P = 0.01, r = 0.49; P = 0.02, r = 0.35; P = 0.001, r = 0.51; respectively). Post-exercise TGF-b 1 levels negatively correlated with eosinophil percentage (P = 0.005, r = \u00c00.42) and positively correlated with maximal post-exercise decrease in FEV 1 (P = 0.047, r = 0.31). There was no significant increase in the concentration of IL-4 levels after exercise challenge in the asthmatics with or without EIB. Conclusion: Our study showed that TGFb 1 may have a role in the suppression of EIB which is a physiological example of the AHR. It has been shown that blockage of TGF-b 1 may result in an increase in AHR in an animal study. Our findings showed that TGF-b 1 , the cytokine associated with regulatory T cells, may have a role in well asthma control and better pulmonary function tests.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 30, "end": 34, "text": "1775", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1191, "end": 1216, "text": "(106.4 pg/ml [91.4-126.4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1217, "end": 1225, "text": "4-126.4]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Poster Session 81"}, {"text": "ST13 polymorphisms increase the risk of exacerbations in steroid-treated asthmatic children and young adults Background: Rhinitis in children is a very common disease, yet not sufficiently studied.

Our aim was to study HRV genotypes, other virus etiology, and their links to patient characteristics in the first wheeze. Method: Nasopharyngeal aspirates and blood samples were collected from 111 first-time wheezing children (88 inpatients, 23 outpatients) in Turku University Hospital. The virus etiology was analyzed from the aspirates by in-house PCR tests for HRV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enteroviruses and human bocavirus-1 and by a multiplex PCR test for HRV A and B, RSV A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1-3, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus (229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1) and influenza A and B virus. HRV genotypes were analysed using a 397-bp variable sequence in the 5\u2032 UTR of the HRV genome. Bocavirus-1 infections were serologically confirmed. Atopy was defined as positive immunoglobulin E antibodies to any of common allergens (>0.35 kU/l). Results: The mean age of the study patients was 12 months (SD 6.0, range 3-23). Male gender predominated (67%), 29% had dermatitis, 23% were sensitised, 20% had parental asthma and 16% had atopic dermatitis. At least one respiratory virus was detected in 100% (111/111) of the cases. HRV was most commonly detected (76%), followed by RSV (28%), bocavirus-1 (17%), parainfluenza virus (9%), metapneumovirus (6%) and each other virus <5%. Of the HRV-positive samples, HRV-C was detected in 43%, HRV-B in 23%, HRV-A in 13% of cases, and 21% of the cases were untypable. Virus co-infection occured in 37% of cases; most commonly with HRV and bocavirus-1 (31%). Four children were only bocavirus-1 positive. Blood eosinophil count >0.4 9 10 9 /l (OR 14.5), atopic dermatitis (OR 6.1), dermatitis (OR 4.2), parental smoking (OR 3.0) and age (per month, OR 1.1) were positively associated with HRV etiology. RSV etiology was positively associated with inpatiency (OR 5.2 compared to non-RSV etiology). Of the HRV positive cases (n = 84), the proportions for hospitalisation were as follows: HRV-A 91%, non-typable HRV 83%, HRV-C 81% and HRV-B 58%. Conclusion: Respiratory virus can be detected in all young children suffering from their first wheezing episode using PCR.

As HRV species C (HRV-C) was recently associated with more severe wheezing attacks, we hypothesised that HRV-C infections would influence allergen sensitisation in children with asthma exacerbation, wheezing and acute lower respiratory illness (ALRI). Method: Children were recruited from the Emergency Department at Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Perth, Western Australia, between June 2003 and November 2010 and were followed-up in convalescence. HRV was detected and typed from nasal specimens using molecular methods. Specific IgE antibodies to 103 aeroallergens and food allergens were measured in patients' serum with the ISAC \u00e2 allergen biochip (ThermoFisher Scientific, Uppsala, Sweden). Results: Of 81 children were studied: 51 (63.0%) male; median age 4.87 years (range 1.8 months-15.56 years). At recruitment, most children were infected with a respiratory virus (90.1%), 69 (86.2%) were positive for HRV and 45 (65.2%) of these were HRV-C. 62 (76.5%) children were already sensitised to at least 1 allergen at recruitment. Of 77 who were followed-up, 14 (18.2%) remained negative at follow-up and only two children (2.6%) developed a sensitisation after recruitment. The most common sensitisation at recruitment (n = 50, 61.7%) was to dust mites (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae and Storage Mites), then animal dander (n = 32, 39.5%) and grass pollens (n = 31, 38.3%). For the 69 children whose HRV infection was successfully typed, HRV-C infection was associated with a significantly higher number of sensitisations at recruitment (median 6, 25th to 75th percentile = 2.5-12) than children who were not infected with HRV-C (median = 3, 25th to 75th percentile = 0-7, P = 0.032, n = 80). Conclusion: In conclusion, aeroallergen sensitisation is common in children with virus-induced acute exacerbations of wheeze or asthma and HRV-C infection may be associated with a higher degree of allergen sensitisation. T-helper (Th) 1, Th2 and antiinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production during pregnancy and after delivery in allergic and non-allergic women. The total IgE levels, but not the allergen-specific IgE levels were increased at gestational week 10-12 as compared to 12 months after delivery in the allergic, but not in the non-allergic women. The aim of this study was to characterise the allergen-induced Th1/Th2/ antiinflammatory immune responses in allergic and non-allergic women by measuring birch and cat allergen induced cytokines and chemokines during pregnancy and postpartum. Method: Twenty women with and 36 women without allergic symptoms were included in the study, of whom 13 were sensitised with allergic symptoms and 30 were non-sensitised without allergic symptoms. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected at gestational week 10-12, 15-16, 25, 35 and 2 and 12 months after delivery were stimulated with birch and cat allergen extracts and phytohemagglutinin (PHA), as positive control. The interleukin-4 (IL)-4 and IL-10 production was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Interferon-c, IL-5, IL-13, the Th1-associated chemokine CXCL10 and the Th2-associated chemokine CCL17 will be quantified using an inhouse Luminex-assay. Results: The sensitised women with allergic symptoms produced higher levels of IL-4 in response to birch allergen at gestational week 25 and in response to cat allergen at gestational week 15, 25, 35 and 2 and 12 months after delivery compared to the non-sensitised women without allergic symptoms. The allergen-induced levels of IL-4 and IL-10 were similar during pregnancy and after delivery in both groups. Conclusion: The sensitised women with allergic symptoms showed increased allergen induced IL-4 levels during pregnancy and postpartum as compared to the nonsensitised women without allergic symptoms, supporting an increased allergen-specific Th2 immune response in the allergic group. The birch and cat induced IL-4 and IL-10 levels were similar during and after pregnancy in both groups, indicating that the previously observed Th2-deviation during pregnancy in the allergic group is not caused by immune responses to allergens.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1796"}, {"text": "Maternal and cord blood miR-223 expression associates with prenatal tobacco smoke exposure and with low Treg numbers Background: There is evidence that miR-NAs are sensitive to environmental stressors including tobacco smoke. On the other side miRNAs are involved in immune regulation, e.g. regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between prenatal tobacco smoke exposure, miRNAs and Treg numbers. Method: Within a prospective motherchild study (LINA) we analysed the expression of miR-155 and miR-223 together with Treg numbers in maternal blood during pregnancy as well as in cord blood. Tobacco smoke exposure was assessed by questionnaires and maternal urine cotinine levels. Additionally, the concentration of smoking related volatile organic compounds (VOC) was measured in dwellings of study participants. Results: Both maternal and cord blood miR-223 expression were positively correlated with maternal urine cotinine levels. An association was also found between maternal miR-223 and indoor concentration of benzene and toluene. High miR-223 expression was associated with lower Treg numbers in maternal and cord blood. Furthermore, children with lower Treg numbers at birth had a higher risk to develop atopic dermatitis during the first 3 years of life. The concentration of the toluene metabolite SBMA (S-benzylmercapturic acid) in maternal urine was associated with decreased cord blood, but not maternal blood, miR-155 expression. A relationship between miR-155 expression and Treg numbers was not found.

Patient associations take action to share best practices Background: The prevention and management of allergic diseases are changing because of scientific evidence questioning old truths. An approach involving healthcare professionals, and patients and relatives is needed to enable everyone to benefit from best practices (WAO White Book, 2011). National Allergy Programmes that integrate these sectors, namely the Finnish and Czech Republic Programmes (Haahtela, Allergy 2008; www. ginasthma.org/CzechInitiativeForAsthma), have proven effective in improving patients' quality of life (QoL) and reducing costs despite the increasing allergy incidence. In 2011, the European Federation of Allergy and Airways Diseases Patients' Associations (EFA) surveyed their member associations in 18 European countries to learn about national respiratory allergy policies. The data showed a greatly improved patients' QoL in countries with a robust national programme, but not in countries in which the national programme fails to involve all stakeholders (e.g. involving only specialists) or is not adequately implemented and sustained (EFA Book on Respiratory Allergy, 2011). Methods: EFA has launched, within its 4year allergy awareness programme, an initiative to promote adoption of allergy programmes throughout Europe. Since EFA recognises the Finnish Allergy Programme (FAP) as gold standard, the first step was to share best practices via meetings between FAP experts and national delegations. The FAP involves professionals and the public, is implemented by NGOs and needs to reach both target groups. Results: From the Helsinki 2012 meeting it emerged that allergy health should be endorsed and tolerance (immunological and psychological) promoted. Programme financing is a challenge, but the work is mostly done by already paid healthcare professionals, who are now trained to set common goals to reduce the disease burden. Programmes must be tailored to local needs and the organisational characteristics of National Health Systems.(P = 0.01), and for incident eczema: 0.66; 95% CI 0.57, 0.77 (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Regular fish consumption in infancy may reduce the risk of allergic disease up to age 12 years, including the risk of IgE-associated allergic disease at age 8 years. Background: It was reported in two studies that inhalation challenges with HDM aggravated skin lesions in patients with atopic dermatitis, especially in those with concomitant allergic asthma. The effect of HDM inhalation on aggravating skin responses in patients with hand eczema had never been investigated. Method: Of 18 patients with vesicular hand eczema and HDM allergy (positive SPT to D. pteronyssinus) were investigated in a randomised, double-blind, placebocontrolled, cross-over study. Increasing concentrations of standardised HDM (80, 400, 2000, 10 000 BU/ml) were inhaled for 1 min at intervals of 15 min. The FEV 1 was measured immediately before and after each dose, after the last challenge every 10 min for 1 h, and thereafter every hour for 7 h. The placebo challenge procedure was the same as described for the active suspension. The time interval between HDM and placebo was 2-4 weeks. Early asthmatic reactions and late asthmatic reactions (LAR) were defined as a placebocorrected fall of 15% or more from baseline of FEV 1 . Hand eczema was scored according to the Dyshidrotic eczema Area and Severity Index (DASI) at baseline, 1, 6, 24 and 48 h. Total IgE was measured at the start of the first provocation day and serum eosinophils on both provocation days before the first challenge and 24 h later. Results: Significant increases in median DASI score and median DASI sub-scores were seen only after HDM provocation. After placebo provocation, no significant differences from baseline were seen. The median DASI increased significantly as compared with baseline at 6 and 48 h after HDM inhalation. This increase was significantly different between the provocations at 6 h. The median vesicles score increased significantly from baseline at 24 and 48 h. Patients with a placebo-corrected increase of vesicles at 24 and 48 h had significantly more often a LAR than those without an increase of vesicles. Patients with a placebo-corrected increase of the DASI at 24 h had as a group a higher mean total IgE level than those without an increase of the DASI. The increase in serum eosinophils 24 h after HDM provocation was not significantly different between the placebocorrected skin responders and non-skin responders. Conclusion: Hand eczema increased significantly more after HDM provocation than after placebo provocation. An increase of vesicles was preceded by a LAR. The group patients with an increase of hand eczema tended to have a higher mean total IgE level. The aim of the study: To investigate the incidence of nervous clinical manifestations in children with pollinosis in the conditions of different pollen load. Method: The study conducted in 2011. Under our observation were 114 children at the age of 10-15 years. Study population was divided into two groups. The first one (N = 59) consisted of children, living in the central region of the city with the average pollen load 31.6 AE 1.4 grains per one air liter 3 , the second group (N = 55) consisted of children, living in the outskirts area with the average pollen load 57.4 AE 1.2 grains per one air liter 3 . Pollen count was assessed by the standard method. The special allergological questionnaires, including the data about neurological manifestations and presence of headache were completed. Results: Pollinosis were diagnosed in all 114 patients on the basis of clinical and laboratory data. The term of 'pollen intoxication' were introduced. It was found that 47 children (85.4%) from the second group had complaints for periodical headache, whereas only 34 (57.6%) of the first group had the same complaints. Severe headache were found in 9 (16.3%) children of the second group and only in 2 (3.38%) patients of the first one. The difference between two groups in ear stuffiness and tinnitus were not statistically significant 15 AE 1. 4 and 17 AE 1.2, respectively (P \u2265 0.05). Complaints for the memory impairment and concentration were the most common in both groups, 51 (86.4%) of the first group and 49 (89.1%) of the second one. Impaired mood and apathy were found in 54 (98.1%) of the second study group, whereas in 47 (79.6%) from the first one. Conclusion: The term of pollen intoxication were introduced for the first time and were determined in children living in the outskirts areas with increased pollen load. In children with neurological clinical manifestations of hay fever psychological inferiority complexes due to impaired study ability should be prevented.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 6206, "end": 6207, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1802"}, {"text": "Progress in venom immunotherapy 1811 Influence of vitamin D on treg population of hymenoptera venom allergic patients Background: A growing number of experimental data recognises the role of vitamin D in the modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses. Vitamin D receptors (VDRs) have indeed been identified in almost all immune cells including B lymphocytes, neutrophils, antigen presenting cells and were highly expressed on CD4+ and CD8+ activated cells (1).Our aim is to study the hypothetic correlations between the administration of vitamin D and the response to specific allergen immunotherapy in patients with reactions to Hymenoptera venom.The primary objective is to analyze the changes in the T regulatory cell population after in vitro stimulation with the allergen and treatment with vitamin D. Method: We enrolled patients with Hymenoptera venom allergy undergoing injective immunotherapy and healthy controls.Blood samples were collected pre-treatment and assays for vitamin D in its biologically active form (1,25 (OH) 2 D 3 ) and in its most frequently circulating form (25 (OH) D 3 ) were carried out.PBMCs were isolated from the blood by means of Ficoll-Hipaque gradient centrifugation and fresh PBMCs were cultured for 48 h in 24-well round-bottom microtiter plate at 1 9 10 6 cells/well with the specific allergen, PHA (5 mg/ml) and in the absence or in the presence of vitamin D (10 \u00c08 M).PBMCs were analysed by flow cytometry using the following mAbs: CD4, CD25 and CD127. Treg lymphocytes were assessed as CD4+ CD25+ CD127\u00c0 cells. According to the results obtained in this first phase, additional tests, such as the analysis of cytokines production (IL-10, IFN-c and IL-4) will be performed by means of ELISA. Results: In our results 1,25-Dihydroxy and 25-Hydroxy vitamin D basal levels did not differ between healthy subjects and patients.Treg cells from both healthy controls (n = 7) and patients (n = 5) showed no sig-nificant response to treatments with respect to untreated cells. We however noticed a significant difference (P < 0.05) in Treg cells percentage when we compared untreated cells from controls and patients. Conclusion: Our preliminary data suggest that Treg cell population is not differently influenced by vitamin D in basal conditions in both healthy subjects and Hymenoptera venom allergic patients. It is presently under investigation the study of Treg population after the induction phase of allergen specific immunotherapy. Background: Systemic symptoms after a sting vary from skin symptoms to lifethreatening reactions like anaphylactic shock and ultimately, cardiac or respiratory arrest. Various risk factors have been described: among others, elevated basal tryptase levels, higher age, cardiovascular diseases, and severe preceding reactions were associated with more severe reactions. Stings in the head and neck region have been discussed to account for most of the fatal reactions; however, there is no recent data available. The aim of the study was to evaluate if there is a correlation between sting localisation and symptom severity. Method: Of 270 patients with confirmed hymenoptera venom allergy were included in the study. Patients were asked about the sting localisation and symptoms using a standardised questionnaire. We hypothesised that stings in skin areas which are well supplied with blood could lead to more rapid and severe reactions. Furthermore, we used excess skin after excision of skin tumors in two persons to perform sting challenges to determine the stinger's depth of penetration. Results: In areas with a thin reticular dermis like in facial skin the stinger reached the deep arteriovenous plexus of the subcutis. In regions with a thick skin like on the back it got stuck in the reticular dermis. However, in the 270 patients, symptom severity was not correlated to the sting localisation: We observed severe reactions (grad III and IV according to Ring and Messmer) in 21.9% of patients after facial stings, in 31.6% after stings in the trunk, in 34.9% after stings in the upper extremities, and in 37.8% after stings in the lower extremities (P = 0.207). Interestingly, 37.7% of patients aged under 50 reported stings in the lower extremities compared to 20.0% of patients aged above 50 years (P = 0.002). Conclusion: Although there was a difference in the stinger's depth of penetration, we did not observe a correlation between sting location and symptom severity. We thus were not able to confirm previous reports of a higher risk for severe reactions after facial stings.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 32, "end": 36, "text": "1811", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Poster Session 83"}, {"text": "The relative delta bound in serum tryptase concentration even below 11.4 lg/l is not an indicator of systemic hypersensitivity side reaction during venom immunotherapy in children Cichocka-Jarosz, E 1 ; Brzyski, P 2 ; Rogatko, I 3 ; Jedynak-Wa z sowicz, U 1 ; Lis, G 1 ; Pietrzyk, JJ 1 Background: An increase in serum tryptase concentration has been proven a good mast cell activation predictor/marker during systemic allergic reactions to field insect stings (FIS) and insect venom immunotherapy (VIT) in different age groups 1, 2, 3 . In a prospective adult study, the relative increase (relative delta bound -RDB) to \u2265135% of tryptase concentration even below 11.4 lg/l in response to FIS or VIT, indicated subjects with systemic hymenoptera venom allergy (HVA) reactions 4 . We attempted to evaluate RDB relevance in VIT-treated children. Method: Serum tryptase levels were measured (ImmunoCAP system) prospectively 1 h before (baseline I) and after the last dose of rush-VIT (delta I) or 1 h after symptoms presentation in patients with systemic side reaction (SSR) to VIT, as well as after a year-long maintenance treatment -1 h before (baseline) and after the regular dose of 100 lg venom extract (II delta). In further analysis, with application of Mann-Whitney test both demographic and clinical data were regarded.Patients: 37 children (M = 29, 78%) mean age 11.0 with systemic HVA history (Mueller grade: II\u00b010 (27%), III\u00b018 (49%), IV\u00b09 (24%)) were treated with 5-day rush-VIT (16 wasp venom, 43%). Seven subjects developed SSR following VIT (reactors with grade of reaction severity: III -3, II -3, I -1). No SSR during maintenance treatment were observed. None of patients experienced FIS during follow-up. Results: Median change of serum tryptase concentration during rush-VIT (delta I) was significantly higher in reactors, equaling 33% (Q1 23%, Q3 121%), while in nonreactors respectively 10% (Q1 4%, Q3 29%; P < 0.001). After 1 year of VIT, median change of tryptase concentration (delta II) related to regular VIT was almost equal in both groups: in reactors Me \u00c06% (Q1 \u00c015%, Q3 \u00c01%), while in non-reactors respectively Me -7% (Q1 \u00c012%, Q3 \u00c03%). Conclusions: Serum tryptase values obtained during suspected hypersensitivity reaction should always be compared to baseline values. Contrary to results seen in adults, a RDB to \u2265135% of tryptase concentration even below 11.4 lg/l during a SSR to incremental dose of VIT was not confirmed in children. Background: The role of platelet-activating factor (PAF) in the pathogenesis of anaphylaxis has been demonstrated in murine models; the administration of platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) or PAF-receptor antagonists prevents mice hypotension and anaphylaxis. Recently two studies on PAF-AH in humans found a correlation between high PAF and low PAF-AH levels and severe anaphylaxis. Interestingly, significantly lower PAF-AH levels were detected in nine children died for peanut anaphylaxis, in respect to patients with not fatal anaphylaxis or allergic reactions. This is the first study evaluating the role of PAF-AH in hymenoptera venom anaphylaxis. Method: We selected 169 hymenoptera venom-allergic patients, classified according to the four Mueller grades of venom anaphylaxis. Sixty healthy subjects were enrolled as controls. Specific venom IgE and serum tryptase were measured by Im-munoCAP (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy) and basal PAF-AH activity was determined by a colorimetric kit (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) with lower detection limit of 20 nmol/ml/min. Data were statistically analyzed by SPSS \u00e2 program release 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Results: No significant differences between the controls and grade I, and between grade III and grade IV were found. PAF-AH activity was significantly different between grade I and II (P < 0.001), and between grade II and III-IV (P < 0.001). Low enzyme levels were detected only in patients with severe anaphylaxis (grade III-IV). 74% of grade III and 89% of grade IV patients presented enzyme activity lower than 20 nmol/ml/min. A correlation between age, serum specific IgE, tryptase and PAF-AH activity was significant only for age (R = \u00c00.184, P = 0.006), being PAF-AH levels lower in elderly subjects. Finally, by means of ROC curve, we found that the best cut-off of PAF-AH activity (sensitivity 89.3%, specificity 81.7%) was 25 nmol/ml/ min, instead of 20 nmol/ml/min. Conclusion: In our hymenoptera venom allergic patients, low PAF-AH activity was significantly decreased in severe anaphylaxis. Differently from Vadas study, where low PAF-AH levels were detectable only in fatal anaphylaxis, in our hymenoptera allergic patients low PAF-AH levels correlate with severe but not fatal anaphylaxis. In hymenoptera venom allergic patients, enzyme levels lower than 25 nmol/ml/min could be considered a prognostic factor for venom severe anaphylaxis. Background: Baseline serum tryptase (BST) is a useful molecular marker for mast cell burden and pathologies involving mast cells, being also helpful in the context of Hymenoptera venom allergy (HVA) and venom immunotherapy (VIT) 1, 2, 3 . Retrospective studies provide evidence for a decline of baseline serum tryptase (BST) concentration during long-term (2-12 years) VIT in adults 4 . There are no data on the dynamics of this marker in VITtreated children.Method: In a prospective study, tryptase levels were measured by ImmunoCAP system four times:1 one hour just before, 2 one hour after the last dose of rush-VIT, or one hour after symptoms presentation in patients with SSR to rush-VIT, 3 after 1 year of maintenance treatment with a monthly administered dose of 100 lg of venom extract, just before the regular dose, 4 one hour after regular maintenance dose. Both systemic and local reactions to venom extract were recorded. None of the patients experienced field sting during follow-up. Further analysis included both clinical and demographic characteristics. Linear regression with gamma distribution of dependent variable and identity linking function was estimated using Generalised Estimating Equations.Patients: 39 children (31 boys, 80%) mean age 11. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] with history of IgE-mediated systemic reaction (Mueller's grades: II\u00b011 (28%), III\u00b018 (46%), IV\u00b010 (26%)) were treated with VIT (16 wasp venom, 41%). Seven of these developed SSR following venom injection during rush-VIT (SSR grades: III \u00c03, II \u00c03, I \u00c01). No systemic reactions and field stings during maintenance treatment were observed. Results: Mean value of BST before VIT was 3.93 lg/l (95%CI = 3.10, 4.76, and increased after VIT to 5.12, 95%CI = 3.53, 6.71, ns), while 1 year later it decreased from 4.44 lg/l (95%CI = 3.39, 95%CI = 3.11, 5.22) , P < 0.001. Multivariate model showed that the change in tryptase level between those four time point measurements was significantly affected by time of measurement (P < 0.001) and SSR during incremental phase of rush-VIT (P = 0.037), interaction between SSR and measurement time (P = 0.018), as well as between measurement time and kind of culprit insect (P = 0.004). Conclusions: In children, the level of BST decreases after 1-year maintenance dose VIT treatment. Basophil activation test in resolving the specific IgE double positivity in patients with unknown culprit insect Erzen, R; Silar, M; Kosnik, M; Korosec, P University Clinic for Pulmonary and Allergic Diseases Golnik, Golnik, Slovenia Background: Double specific IgE positivity to honeybee and wasp venom is evident in up to 60% of Hymenoptera venom allergic patients. Distinguishing between true double sensitisation and cross-reactivity is crucial for the choice of proper allergen for specific immunotherapy, especially in patients with unknown culprit insect. In our study, we tried to evaluate the role of basophile activation test (BAT) in resolving this problem. Method: 18 patients with specific IgE to both honeybee and wasp venom were included into the study. All patients experienced severe anaphylaxis of Muller grade III or IV and did not recognise the culprit insect. BAT was performed on whole blood with maximal 1 and sub-maximal 0.1 lg/ml of honeybee and wasp venom allergen concentrations. Results: BAT was single positive in 4 (22%) and double positive in 14 (71%) patients. Of four single positive BAT patients three were positive for wasp venom and one for bee venom. In BAT double positive patients the response to sub-maximal 0.1 lg/ml of allergen concentration was at least 4-fold higher (median 14-fold) for one venom then for other venom in majority of cases (9 of 14 patients). In five patients the sub-maximal basophil response was markedly higher for honeybee and in four patients for wasp venom. Conclusion: BAT is a helpful, but also limited diagnostic tool, which can directly resolve the problem of double positivity in about one fifth of patients. However, in case of BAT double positivity the apparent differences between sub-maximal responses suggest that additional whole dose response curve analysis might further elucidates the pattern of double positivity, possibly showing a clinical relevance for only single venom. Background: Patients showing repeated systemic anaphylactic reactions (SAR) during venom immunotherapy (VIT) are a particular risk group. For these patients, it is of utmost importance that VIT can be continued and that tolerance to VIT and to subsequent stings is established. Method: We retrospectively included consecutive patients who (i) had exhibited repeated moderate to severe SAR to VIT, (ii) in whom antihistamines (in some cases in combination with corticosteroids) were ineffective to prevent SAR to VIT, (iii) for whom we had managed to find a sponsor for an anti-IgE-antibody (omalizumab) treatment, and (iv) who had consented to an off-label therapy by this drug. After the first appearance of SAR VIT was either stopped or continued with the lowest tolerated venom dose every 2-4 weeks. Subsequent dosing of omalizumab was done according to the recommendations established for asthma treatment, and was guided by total IgE-levels and body weight. Omalizumab was injected 4 and 1 week before, and every 4 weeks after the new build-up phase of VIT. Simultaneously, patients received an elevated maintenance venom dose. After 4-6 months on maintenance VIT, omalizumab was stopped. Sting challenge was done at a time when at least 6 months had passed since the discontinuation of omalizumab. Results: Nine patients (four males, mean age 40.9 years at the beginning of omalizumab therapy) could be analysed. Four patients had mastocytosis. Omalizumab was given to eight patients on bee VIT and to two patients on Vespula VIT; one patient received omalizumab for a bee and Vespula VIT. After pre-treatment with omalizumab VIT was tolerated by all patients. Maintenance venom dose was 200 lg in three patients with a bee VIT, and in two patients with a Vespula VIT. Five patients with a bee VIT received a 300 lg maintenance venom dose. Sting challenge was done in eight patients (six patients with a bee venom allergy, and two patients with a Vespula venom allergy) and was tolerated by all patients. Conclusion: Patients showing repeated SAR during VIT may universally profit from an omalizumab pretreatment and from the application of an increased maintenance venom dose. However, prospective randomised studies are necessary to evaluate this treatment approach. Background: We recently showed a desensitisation of FceRI-mediated basophil response after short-term VIT. Our aim was to evaluate if the observed basophil desensitisation is allergen specific. Method: In ten Hymenoptera venom double sensitised and two mono sensitised subjects basophil threshold sensitivity (CDsens) to anti-FceRI, honeybee and Vespula venom was assessed at the beginning and just before the first maintenance dose (MD) of single ultra-rush VIT. Genuine double sensitisation to both venoms was confirmed in seven subjects with recombinant Api m 1 and Ves v 5 and/or Ves v 1. Results: We demonstrated a marked reduction of CD-sens to anti-FceRI and VIT-specific Hymenoptera venom before the first MD in all included subjects. Furthermore a significant and comparable decrease was evident both in VIT and non-VIT Hymenoptera venom before the first MD of single ultra-rush VIT in nine out of ten double sensitised subjects. Most evident decreases in CD63 basophil response were achieved at low submaximal concentrations of allergen stimulation. Conclusion: Short-term VIT induced basophil desensitisation of VIT-specific as well as VIT-non-specific allergen. In genuinely double sensitised subjects to both venoms the decrease in basophil response was evident both in VIT and non-VIT Hymenoptera venom. As opposed to long-term VIT which induces allergen-specific basophil changes, the mechanisms of short-term VIT seem to be allergen non-specific. Background: Little data exists regarding contraindications to VIT in children and pregnant women and current practice patterns among allergists. Method: A web-based survey (Surveymonkey \u00e2 ) was sent out to all AAAAI members to explore their experience with VIT regarding dosing, pre-medication, and use in pregnancy and young children. Results: Six hundred and ninty-seven of 5123 (14%) surveys were completed. Eighty-seven percent of respondents were US-based, with 28% working in an academic setting, and 41%, 54% and 5% working in urban, suburban and rural settings, respectively. Most respondents had worked as an Allergist for >15 years (62%). Most respondents had \u226410 patients (43%) or 10-50 patients (41%) on VIT, while 5.8% did not prescribe VIT (6%). For flying Hymenoptera, a maintenance dose of 100 lg (300 lg for mixed Vespid) is used by 92.5% of respondents. Only 38% of respondents prescribe imported fire ant(IFA) IT, utilizing a maintenance dose of 0.5 ml of a 1:100 wt/vol (63%), 0.5 ml of 1:10 wt/vol (29%) or 0.5 ml of 1:200 wt/vol (9%). Regarding pre-medication, 24% pre-medicate routinely, 10% only premedicate for accelerated schedules, and the remaining 65% do not pre-medicate routinely or pre-medicate only for high-risk patients: 46% use H1 antihistamines, 6% H2 antihistamines, and 9% leukotriene receptor antagonists. Of Allergists who treat children, many would give VIT down to as young as age 5 (42%), while some would give VIT down to 1 (8%), 2 (11%), 3 (8%) or 4 (8%) years old. Most respondents (71%) felt pregnancy was a contraindication for starting VIT. Of those who reported starting pregnant women, most had 1-4 patients on VIT and had experienced no problems (70%), while fewer had experienced minor (22%) or major (8%) problems. More respondents (51%) would continue VIT if the woman became pregnant after starting therapy. Most Allergists reported no problems (66%) or minor problems (18%) in this scenario with very few major problems (1.2%). Conclusion: The most common maintenance dose was 100 lg for flying Hymenoptera and 0.5 ml of 1:100 wt/vol for IFA. Most Allergists do not pre-medicate routinely, but when doing so most commonly use H1 antihistamines. While many Allergists felt comfortable using VIT in young children, most felt pregnancy was a contraindication for starting VIT. Background: The family Vespidae includes subfamilies Vespinae and Polistinae. Subfamily Vespinae is part of the Vespula, Dolichovespula and Vespa genera, and among the Vespa genus, it is the Vespa crabro (VC -European hornet) that predominates in Europe. A recent study conducted in the Mediterranean area showed that the relative risk of developing severe systemic reactions is three times higher from a hornet sting compared to the bee or wasp. In the case of sensitisation to VC venom, the European guidelines consider venom immunotherapy (VIT) using only Vespula venom sufficient for obtaining adequate protection against an allergic reaction. However, antigen 5 immunoblotting studies showed that there is a true allergic sensitisation to VC venom, thus this venom should be used in VIT. For the last few years, VC venom has been available for use in diagnosis and in VIT (Anallergo srl). We evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of VIT with VC venom in patients who have had a systemic reaction to the VC sting and who were eligible to be admitted to the VIT. Method: VIT: a modified rush regimen was used; during the build-up period, VC venom in the aqueous phase was used, while VC venom adsorbed in tyrosine was used during the maintenance phase. Results: Two hundred and five patients were admitted to the VIT program, of Background: A preferential association between systemic mastocytosis (SM) and Hymenoptera allergy (HVA) has been observed. Patients with both diseases are at risk for more severe reactions and venom immunotherapy (VIT) may represent a lifesaving treatment, but the use of VIT in such patients raised concerns about the safety. Objective: We evaluated a large population of patients with SM and HVA receiving VIT. Methods: This prospective study was performed in Italy and Spain. Diagnosis of SM and HVA and VIT prescription were made according to international recommendations. Patients were carefully followed-up during VIT, with a special attention to field-stings. Results: Of 84 patients (70 male, mean age 52.1), were included, 81% with grade IV reaction, 91% with indolent SM. No difference was seen between the Italian and Spanish patients. There were ten adverse reactions during the induction phase: three with the conventional induction and seven with the rush-modified induction, none resulting in epinephrine administration/ hospitalisation. Fifty patients had one or more field re-sting (95 episodes), none during build-up. The time elapsed from starting VIT and first re-sting was 2 months-7 years, and the number of re-stings per patient was 1-6. Of the 50 re-stung patients, 43 (86%) resulted to be fully protected. Seven patients had reactions, and the maintenance dose was safely increased to 200 lg. The maintenance dose interval was not different between patients with and without reactions at re-stings. Conclusions: VIT is well tolerated, safe and effective in patients with SM.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 284, "end": 285, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 528, "end": 530, "text": "1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 531, "end": 533, "text": "2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 534, "end": 535, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 776, "end": 777, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 5159, "end": 5161, "text": "1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5162, "end": 5164, "text": "2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5165, "end": 5166, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 6197, "end": 6200, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6201, "end": 6204, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6205, "end": 6208, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 6209, "end": 6212, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 6213, "end": 6216, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6217, "end": 6220, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6221, "end": 6224, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 6225, "end": 6228, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6229, "end": 6232, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 6233, "end": 6237, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6238, "end": 6242, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6243, "end": 6247, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6248, "end": 6252, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6253, "end": 6257, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6258, "end": 6262, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6263, "end": 6267, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6268, "end": 6272, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6780, "end": 6804, "text": "4.44 lg/l (95%CI = 3.39,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6805, "end": 6818, "text": "95%CI = 3.11,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6819, "end": 6824, "text": "5.22)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 14728, "end": 14733, "text": "(22%)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1813"}]}
