In order to demonstrate the evolutionary selection for long/complex patterns of silent functional information captured by AHRS/AVRS measures, we compared the wildtype viral sequences to 1,000 corresponding randomized variants ( Figure S4IV) . Two different randomization models that control for different mutational and selection biases were employed ( Figure S2 ): the first, Synonymous Codon Randomization (SCDR), which preserves both the amino acid content and order, and the synonymous codon usage; the second, Dinucleotide Randomization (DNTR), which preserves both the amino acid content and order, and the frequencies of all possible dinucleotides (pairs of nucleotides). In addition, these randomization models preserve such basic sequence features as the encoded proteins and the frequencies of amino acids, codons, and mono and dinucleotides; however, they do not preserve more complex compositional patterns. If, indeed, there was a selection for a common high dimensional information that could not be explained merely by the amino acid content and order, nucleotide composition (e.g., GC content), preference for nucleotide pairs (e.g., CpG suppression) and codon usage bias (e.g., translation pressure on tRNA-codon affiliations), then we would expect longer or more abundant substrings of viral nucleotides to be repeated in the host or in the virus itself rather than in the corresponding randomized variants; respectively the AHRS and/or AVRS scores are expected to be higher in the wildtype than in random.",

In Figure S6C , we demonstrated that the portion of viruses that are both AHRS and AVRS significant is significantly (p<0.001) higher than expected in random (Figure S6D) , for all host domains. On the other hand, we can see that host-repetitive and virus repetitive substring are not fully redundant, and one signal cannot be always explained by means of the other Both of these evolutionary forces can often act both independently and together in the same virus, and both may have important roles in improving the viral fitness. Figure S5 : Selection for long virus-repetitive patterns of silent functional information in viral coding regions. Each vertical bar corresponds to viruses infecting a specific host organism (in bacteria a specific genus) and is partitioned into class specific segments; every segment corresponds to percentage of viruses belonging to its corresponding class (y-axis) and is assigned a specific color. Further, each segment is composed of two stacked parts: the lower part with full color interior represents the portion (out of all host-specific viruses) of AVRS-significant viruses (p<0.05 w.r.t both randomization models); and the upper part with black interior (but with borders of the corresponding color) represents the rest of the viruses (p\u22650.05 w.r.t at least one randomization model). Thus, for each class-specific segment, the sum of its two parts (significant and not significant) represent the total portion of viruses of this class within all viruses related to an organism described by the bar, and the sum of all segments is equal to 1.The horizontal bars visualizes the total percentage of AVRSsignificant viruses in each host domain. We can see that coding regions in 47%, 36%, 39%, 27%, 25%, and 90% of viruses from different classes, that infect one or several vertebrates, meatzoa, plants, fungi, protists, and bacteria organisms correspondingly, undergo an evolutionary pressure to maintain long genomic substrings that also tend to repeat in the other coding regions of the same virus. The average wildtype AHRS value (11.70) is higher than the average randomized (11.47) and this relation is statistically significant (Wilcoxon rank-sum right tail p<10 -10 ). B. Distribution of AVRS values for wildtype and randomized viral coding sequences. The average wildtype AVRS value (8.45) is significantly higher than the average randomized (6.43) and this relation is statistically significant (Wilcoxon rank-sum right tail p<10 -100 ). C. Percentage of viruses that are both AHRS and AVRS significant is higher than expected in random. The overlap between these two sets of viruses was measured (for each host domain separately) by their intersection over union (IoU) and compared with the values expected in random (see also Methods). D. One-versus-rest randomization model for testing the statistical significance of the overlap between the sets AHRS and AVRS significant viruses. The randomized intersection over union values were modeled as follows: for each randomized variant of each wild-type virus, we compared its AHRS (AVRS) values to the corresponding values of the remaining randomized variants of the same virus (each tow in a column is compared with the rest of the rows in the same column). As a result, we obtained 1,000 sets of randomized AHRS (AVRS) p-values; each set (row) containing one randomized p-value for each one of the viruses. We than, identified those variants with p-value < 0.05 (marked in yellow) and computed the intersection over union of these variants for AHRS and AVRS for each row, yielding 1000 randomized intersection over union values. This algorithm was performed separately for DNTR and SCDR randomization models; the results were unified and plotted in the histogram (blue). The wildtype IoU values for each host kingdom are plotted by color lines. We can see that that the portion of viruses that are both AHRS and AVRS significant is significantly (p<0.05) higher than expected in random in all host domains.",

In order to analyze the relations of such characteristics to the selection for more complex / long hostrepetitive silent patterns reported here, we computed, for each virus, the following 'low-dimensional' genomic features (LDF): Effective Number of Codons (ENC), Codon Pairs Bias (CPB), Dinucleotides Bias (DNTB), GC and CpG content and the total length of (non-host homologous) coding sequences (details in the Methods section). The results of comparison of these features to the corresponding combined z-scores of AHRS values (AHRS-z) averaged across the different random models are shown in Figure S7 . We can see that for AHRS-significant viruses, the Spearman rank correlation between the LDF and AHRS-z residuals (the variation in LDF and AHRS-z variables after controlling for the length of the sequences) cannot explain the selection for long-host repetitive patterns ( Figure S7A ) merely by their relation to more basic genomic features. The negative correlation with ENS (in all domains, but fungi) can be explained by a selection pressure on adaptation to the host which can be manifested both by adaptation of codons and by longer/more complex patterns. The negative correlation with CpG in vertebrates and the positive correlation in bacteria may be a consequence of the fact that CpG pairs are suppressed in the former and prevalent in the latter genomes (Cooper and Krawczak, 1989; Krieg, 2002) . Also, a positive correlation with GC content in all host kingdoms with the strongest one in bacteria was observed; this may be related to the fact that in some cases highly expressed genes tend to have stronger mRNA folding and thus GC content (due to strong relation between GC content and folding strength (Zur and Tuller, 2012) ). The correlation with Codon Pairs Bias is very small (0.01-0.16) and is negative or close to zero in all hosts but fungi; this suggests that in general the results reported here do not strongly overlap with Codon Pairs Bias.",

Figure S7 : Relation between low dimensional features and AHRS z-scores. LDF values and corresponding AHRS-z scores (AHRS-z) may be significantly correlated (either positively or negatively) due to a positive correlation of both of them with the genome length. Therefore, to control for the viral genome length, we computed a partial correlation between the LDF and combined AHRS Z values (computed as an average of the AHRS-z scores with respect to each random model). A partial correlation between X and Y, given a control variable Z, is the correlation between the residuals R X and R Y resulting from the linear regression of X with Z and of Y with Z respectively. These residuals are actually the variation in X and Y variables that are not explained by the control variable Z. In the figure, the length-controlled relations between LDF values of AHRS-significant and not-significant viruses, and between the AHRS-z and different LDFs for significant viruses are demonstrated for each LDF and host domain (due to a small number of protest viruses, this domain was excluded). The LDF and AHRS-z variables are represented by their Z-standardized (mean 0, variance 1) residuals (in the analysis of AHRS-z with genome length itself, a regular spearman correlation was performed, since in this case the correlated variable is the same as control).

To this end, we build a linear regression model that uses all these LDFs and is aimed to maximize the correlation with the AVRS/AHRS scores. The regression model was separately performed on each host group with more than 100 significant viruses (i.e. separately for Bacteria, Plants, and Vertebrates). For each host group, we randomly separated all the 6 features into two sets using 50% of the viruses as a train set and the rest (50%) as a test set (i.e. each contains 50% of the viruses having a significant AVRS score; see more details in the supplementary data). Hence, the regression model was build based on the first group and was tested on the second group, by performing a correlation between the predicted and the actual AVRS scores. Results gave regression correlation of 0.39<r<0.71, when using all the 6 features (p<4.58\u00b710 -7 ); see details in Supplementary Table ST2 ). This demonstrates that only up to 15%-50% of the variance can be explained by these 'low dimensional' features. Furthermore, the results of comparison of these features to the AHRS statistics of the corresponding genomes, demonstrated explicitly that selection for long host-repetitive patterns cannot be explained merely by their relation to more basic genomic features. Thus, we conclude that the low dimensional features typically explain relatively low percentage of the AVRS score variability.",

These patterns are encoded in viral genomic substring repeats in the coding regions of viruses and in the coding regions of their hosts. In order to further understand how these patterns properties, we generated distribution histograms of the substring length. Specifically, we considered only substrings that were significantly longer than expected (i.e. with p<0.05 compared to our randomized models). The median substring length was found to be 39 ( Figure S8A) . Additionally, we separated the substrings into various subgroups according to their host type (Fungi, Bacteria, Plants, Vertebrates, Protists, and Metazoa) and virus type, based on the Baltimore classification (Figure S8B-C) ; see details in Supplementary Table ST1.

            "text": "In order to further understand how the repetitive patterns found promote viral fitness and affect gene expression, we performed comprehensive inspection and looked for de-novo sequence motifs that appear in the repetitive substrings of human viruses. Specifically, we analyzed these significantly long substrings using an algorithm for finding de-novo sequence motifs (Heinz et al., Mol Cell, 2010 ) that appear in human viruses more than in comparison to our randomized models; see also previous sections. The analysis found 1125 significant motifs (p<0.05); the motifs were sorted by their p-values, and after controlling for false discovery rate (FDR; q=0.01), we end up with 1089 motifs; see Supplementary Table ST3 . Similar motifs, with similarity score higher than 0.6 can be found in Supplementary Table ST4 .Next, we compared these motifs against known information of transcription factor biding sites (TFBS) and RNA biding proteins (RBPs), which were taken from the JASPAR (Khan et al., NAR, 2018) and RBPmap (Paz et al., NAR, 2014) databases. Specifically, for each host-virus pair we used these substrings as a target set, and compared them to a similar background set of substrings, taken from our randomized models (i.e. sub-sequences with the same length, GC content, CUB, etc.). The results show enrichments of TFs related to the following classes: Basic helix-loop-helix factors (bHLH), C2H2 zinc finger factors, and Tryptophan cluster factors. We also found enrichments of RBPs for the HNRNPxx, PABPxx, and SRFSx proteins; see more details in Supplementary Tables ST5-ST6 .Finally, we performed this type of analysis on target sets of substrings and on randomized viral genomes, which maintain the encoded protein sequences, the codon frequencies and GC content (but not the codons order); this demonstrated that we get significantly lower number of TFs/RBPs in this cases in comparison to the analysis done on the actual data (p<0.03 and p<0.04, respectively). This result supports our hypothesis that indeed evolution shape viral coding region to include \"meaningful\" sub-sequences, longer than single codons, important to the viral fitness, and also provides an interesting explanation regarding the function of some of the detected sub-sequences.",

The analyzed viral coding regions where divided into 4 bins according to their lengths. The enrichment of AHRS significant genes in different functional proteins groups was analyzed for each gene independently. We can see that within each bin the structural group is the most enriched one and the surface group and enzymes are less enriched. Therefore our conclusions cannot be attributed to the lengths of coding regions.

These codes enable efficient immune system avoidance; specifically they may enable escaping the CRISPR system. B. The codes enable a better adaptation to the host gene expression machinery.",
