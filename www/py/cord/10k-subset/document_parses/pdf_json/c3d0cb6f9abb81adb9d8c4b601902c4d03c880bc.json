Using intravital microscopy, we show that the immediate (<30 min) neutrophil response to I/R is similar in males and females but that prolonged neutrophil recruitment occurs in males at sites local and distal to inflammatory insult partly due to an increase in circulating neutrophil populations with elevated surface expression of adhesion molecules. Sex differences in neutrophil kinetics were correlated with sustained induction of chemokine Cxcl5 in the tissue, circulation, and bone marrow of males but not females. Furthermore, blockade of Cxcl5 in males prior to ischemia resulted in neutrophil responses that were similar in magnitude to those in females. Conversely, administration of Cxcl5 to males in the absence of I/R was sufficient to increase levels of systemic neutrophils. Cxcl5 treatment of bone marrow neutrophils in vitro caused substantial induction of neutrophil-mobilizing cytokine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) and expression of \u03b22 integrin that accounts for sexual dimorphism in circulating neutrophil populations in I/R. Moreover, male Cxcl5stimulated bone marrow neutrophils had an increased capacity to adhere to \u03b22 integrin ligand ICAM-1, implicating a greater sensitivity of male leukocytes to Cxcl5-mediated activation. Differential induction of Cxcl5 (human CXCL6) between the sexes was also evident in murine renal I/R, rat pleurisy, and human skin blisters and correlated with the magnitude of neutrophil accumulation in tissues.",

For example, the severity and incidence of I/R-induced organ failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are substantially higher in men compared to those in women (for reviews, see [4] [5] [6] ). While differential lifestyle/environmental factors between men and women influence outcome of these conditions, sex differences are also evident in experimental mammalian models of disease, intimating that this sex bias is an inherent feature in males. Elucidation of the male and female patterns of innate immune responses has important implications for understanding disease progression in men and women and therefore appropriate targeting of antiinflammatory therapies [7] . We have previously demonstrated that acute exposure to bacteria and other irritants in male mice and rats result in increased severity of inflammation compared to females, associated with enhanced recruitment of neutrophils into tissues [8] . Similarly, other studies indicate increased neutrophil accumulation following cytokine treatment or I/R in males [9, 10] . However, many fundamental aspects of this differential regulation of neutrophils remain unclear, and thus, attempts to exploit such sex differences therapeutically have not yet been successful. For example, it remains unclear whether neutrophil responses in females involve distinct molecular pathways, or whether female responses are delayed or resolve earlier than in males. Thus, to understand the regulatory mechanisms that underlie differential neutrophil responses between the sexes, we have investigated the temporal regulation and molecular pathways of neutrophil recruitment in males compared to those in females.",

Neutrophils are recruited via the leukocyte adhesion cascade through multiple steps (e.g. rolling adhesion and emigration), mediated by adhesion molecules including selectins and integrins [13] . The bone marrow is considered to be the primary site of neutrophil production and a store of neutrophils that can be rapidly mobilized to increase the number of circulating neutrophils available for recruitment at sites of inflammatory insult. Therefore, regulation of neutrophil release from the bone marrow is a key step that dictates the magnitude and duration of neutrophil recruitment. Similar to recruitment from the blood into the tissues, trafficking of neutrophils out of the bone marrow into the circulation is also directed by ELR+ chemokines. The actions of ELR+ chemokines in bone marrow mobilization are a combined effect of direct interaction with neutrophil Cxcr2 receptors together with the negative regulation of the predominant bone marrow neutrophil retention pathway, i.e., neutrophil Cxcr4 and its ligand Cxcl12 (for review, see [14] ).",

The aim of our study was to investigate sexual dimorphism in neutrophil kinetics and identify the specific chemokines responsible for bringing about these effects. We found that the onset of neutrophil infiltration into tissues was similar between the sexes but that the levels continued to increase with time in males due to substantial increases in circulating neutrophils. The predominant endogenous chemotactic mediator generated by I/R in males was ELR+ chemokine Cxcl5 (human CXCL6 [15] ), which had a unique temporal profile compared to other chemokines that accounts for sustained neutrophil stimulation, mobilization, and recruitment during reperfusion. The greater induction of Cxcl5 in males was associated with more neutrophilia and consequently a higher magnitude of neutrophil recruitment and tissue injury than that in females. Therefore, these studies provide the first evidence for sex-specific regulation of Cxcl5/6 in acute inflammatory states.",

Rats were placed on a heated (37\u00b0C) viewing stage, and a loop of intestine was exposed to visualize the mesenteric microcirculation. The mesentery was superfused with Tyrode's solution (5 % CO 2 , pH 7.4). Images were recorded using Pinnacle Studio software (v.9). In each animal, a single un-branched postcapillary venule (diameter 25-40 \u03bcm, length >400 \u03bcm) was selected for the study. The following parameters were measured: leukocyte flux, rolling velocity, adhesion, and emigration. Rolling leukocytes were observed as cells moving visibly slower than red blood cells and were measured by counting the number of rolling leukocytes passing a fixed reference point (flux) on the vessel segment over a 2-min period. Leukocyte rolling velocity was determined from the time required for a randomly chosen leukocyte to roll across 200 \u03bcm. Rolling velocities of six leukocytes were averaged and expressed as micrometer per second. Adherent leukocytes were identified as cells that remained stationary within the vascular lumen for a period of at least 30 s and were counted in four consecutive 100-\u03bcm vessel segments. Leukocyte emigration from the postcapillary venule into the tissue was quantified by counting the number of cells up to 50, 50-100, and 100-150 \u03bcm away from the vessel wall in parallel with 100-\u03bcm vessel segments. Four readings were taken for each vessel and quantified on one side of the vessel wall. Red blood cell centreline velocity was measured in venules using an optical Doppler velocimeter (Microcirculation Research Institute, Texas A&M University, USA). Mean red blood cell velocity was calculated from centreline velocity/1.6, and venular shear rate was determined based on the Newtonian definition (8000 \u00d7 mean red blood cell velocity / venular diameter).",

Indeed, reperfusion stimulated a time-dependent surge in circulating neutrophils in males but had little effect on blood neutrophil populations in females (Fig. 1f) . In contrast, the modest I/ R-induced changes in circulating monocyte numbers were similar in both sexes, suggesting a selective differential regulation of neutrophil mobilization in males (Additional file 2: Figure S1D ).

Acute granulopoeisis and neutrophil maturation/mobilization during infection are controlled by granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) [22] . Accordingly, I/R induced an early and sustained synthesis of GCSF by bone marrow cells and ischemic mesenteric tissue in males but not females (Fig. 2a) . These results imply that increased GCSF levels in males stimulate enhanced bone marrow neutrophil motility compared to those in females during reperfusion. Indeed, we noted a significant increase in the size of individual bone marrow neutrophils in males at 2-h reperfusion, indicative of neutrophil shape change [17, 18] (Fig. 2b) . Furthermore, surface integrin expression (\u03b22: Fig. 2c ; \u03b21, \u03b14, \u03b1L, \u03b1M: Additional file 4: Figure S3 ) on the bone marrow and circulating neutrophils at 2-h reperfusion was significantly elevated in males but remained unchanged in females. A possible functional consequence of increased circulating neutrophils with high integrin expression is that neutrophils can infiltrate other tissues remote to the site of inflammatory insult. In particular, secondary injury of the Fig. 2 Increased bone marrow neutrophil stimulation in males.

Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in lung tissue, an index of neutrophil accumulation, remained unaltered in the lungs of female rats but was elevated fivefold in males by the end of reperfusion (Fig. 2d) . Thus, these studies strongly indicate that more bone marrow neutrophils are mobilized in males during I/R and that neutrophils circulating during reperfusion exhibit a greater adhesive phenotype compared to females. Together, this differential regulation of neutrophils may protect against local and remote tissue injury in females.",

            "text": "Pro-mobilization signals during infection typically arise from local tissue production of cytokines and chemokines at the site of infection. To verify the primary cellular source of I/R-induced chemokine production, we measured chemokine mRNA in mesenteric tissue at 30-min and 2-h reperfusion. In males, tissue Cxcl5 mRNA was rapidly induced upon reperfusion and increased with reperfusion time whereas induction of chemokines Cxcl1 and Ccl2 were greater at 30 min and had declined by 2 h (Fig. 3d and Additional file 5: Figure S4A ). The profile of circulating levels of chemokine protein mirrored the profile of tissue mRNA levels ( Fig. 3e and Additional file 4: Figure S4B ), implicating the ischemic tissue as a principle source of these chemokines. Importantly, levels of both tissue and circulating chemokines were less in females with the greatest fold difference being release of Cxcl5 (Fig. 3d ). Sex differences in chemokine levels were specific to ligands for Cxcr2 or Ccr2 since induction of chemokines Ccl3/MIP1\u03b1 or Ccl5/RANTES (ligands for Ccr1+ and Ccr5+ leukocytes) was similar in both sexes (Additional file 5: Figure S4C-D) . The unique profile of Cxcl5 synthesis and its differential induction between the sexes indicates that this particular chemokine may be a pivotal endogenous mediator of I/R-induced neutrophil responses and tissue injury. Neutralization of Cxcl5 in males reduced plasma Cxcl5 at 2-h reperfusion from 10.2 \u00b1 2.43 to 2.0 \u00b1 0.37 ng/ml (P < 0.05, n = 5) and dampened I/R-induced leukocyte dynamics (Fig. 3f , Additional file 5: Figure S4C -D) to similar levels as those seen in females (Fig. 1d) . The effect of anti-Cxcl5 on leukocyte recruitment was partly due to a reduction in neutrophilia (Fig. 3g) , which was also limited to a similar magnitude as that in females (Fig. 1f ) . Collectively, these studies demonstrate that augmented levels of Cxcl5 in males account for increased neutrophilia during I/R compared to females.",

Cxcl5, but not Cxcl1, increased GCSF mRNA in both sexes (Fig. 4e) , implicating that Cxcl5 can influence bone marrow neutrophil numbers and stimulation. Consistent with this notion, Cxcl5 promoted expression of \u03b22 integrins in RP1+ neutrophils (Fig. 4f ) . Notably, this effect of Cxcl5 was significantly greater in male neutrophils compared to females, as confirmed by the increased ability of Cxcl5-stimulated male leukocytes to adhere to \u03b22 integrin ligand ICAM1 (Fig. 4g) . Cxcl5, but not equivalent amounts of Cxcl1, stimulated expression of Cxcr2 as well as Cxcl5 in leukocytes from both sexes (Fig. 4h,i) .

Therefore, to understand whether sex-specific regulation of Cxcl5 in I/R occurs in other organs and mammals, we measured tissue and circulating chemokines following acute bilateral renal I/R in male and female mice. Renal ischemia of 30 min followed by 24-h reperfusion resulted in greater levels of tissue Cxcl5 mRNA in males than females (Fig. 5a) as well as plasma Cxcl5 protein (1070 \u00b1 87 pg/ml and 540 \u00b1 91, P < 0.01, n = 4, respectively). Similar to mesenteric I/R, this chemokine profile in males was also associated with more circulating neutrophils than that in females (Fig. 5b) . Next, we examined whether disparate induction of Cxcl5 also dictates sex differences in neutrophil responses induced by an exogenous stimulus. Injection of carrageenan into the pleural cavity of rats results in greater accumulation of fluid (Fig. 5c) and neutrophils in the cavity in males than in females [8] . This sex difference in pleurisy was also associated with higher levels of Cxcl5 in the lung tissue and bone marrow of males compared to females (Fig. 5d,e) .",

Specifically, we provide evidence that Cxcl5/6 is the key molecular signal whose greater induction in males primarily affects circulating neutrophil numbers and adhesion molecule expression, thereby enhancing tissue infiltration. Tissue injury during I/R involves multiple complex interacting mechanisms and several cell types (for review, see [26] ). In this study, we focused on understanding sex differences in the initial inflammatory response during I/R and the early stages of neutrophil recruitment. We, and others, have demonstrated increased total neutrophil infiltration of tissues in males compared to females in acute inflammatory states [8] [9] [10] . In agreement with these studies, we observed substantially greater neutrophil influx into the peritoneal cavity following mesenteric I/R in male rats compared to age-matched females. Migration of blood neutrophils to sites of inflammatory insult is a multi-step process involving leukocyte rolling, adhesion, and emigration that is regulated by a network of chemokines, particularly ELR+ chemokines. In the current study, we aimed to understand the primary differences in neutrophil dynamics between males and females. Using IVM to monitor changes in I/R-induced leukocyte responses within the same animal in the mesenteric vasculature in real time, we reveal that the initial (<30 min) increase in leukocyte flux during reperfusion is similar between the sexes. In males, these responses continue to increase with reperfusion time, leading to accumulation of substantial number of neutrophils within the peritoneal cavity by 2 h.

However, the velocity of rolling male leukocytes is similar to female cells, suggesting little differences in leukocyte motility and their ability to interact with blood vessels. Sex differences in neutrophil dynamics appear to be predominantly due to the greater neutrophilia that is evident in males throughout reperfusion. Therefore, the male neutrophil response does not appear to be an earlier onset or slower clearance of recruited cells compared to females but rather a difference in the absolute magnitude of the response brought about, in part, by more neutrophils available in the circulation at later stages of reperfusion. Indeed, the extent of tissue injury in the intestine is directly correlated with the number of circulating neutrophils and is therefore substantially greater in males. Similarly, several lines of evidence indicate that severity of inflammatory diseases are correlated with the extent of circulating neutrophils [27] [28] [29] , pathologies that are also considered to be more severe in age-matched men compared to women. We believe that distinct regulation of neutrophil trafficking in males may be a fundamental feature of acute inflammatory responses.",

Circulating and bone marrow levels of Cxcl5 are upregulated by I/R and increase with reperfusion time in males, with little induction of Cxcl5 evident in females. Indeed, blockade of Cxcl5 in males results in an identical neutrophil response as that seen in females. As such, leukocyte/vessel wall interactions within 45-min reperfusion are unaffected by Cxcl5 inhibition but leukocyte recruitment and tissue injury at later stages of reperfusion are substantially reduced. Thus, Cxcl5 has a predominant role in driving sustained neutrophil recruitment during I/R. At early time points, neutrophil infiltration is most likely mediated by other chemokines such as Cxcl1 and Ccl2 that are transiently induced in tissues of both sexes and can recruit neutrophils already in the circulation. The functional effect of Cxcl5 production during I/R in males is partly to increase circulating neutrophils since inhibition of Cxcl5 also reduces I/R-induced neutrophilia to similar levels seen in females. Conversely, administration of Cxcl5 to males in the absence of ischemic insult is sufficient to account for sex differences in I/R-induced changes in circulating neutrophil populations. Therefore, Cxcl5 has a non-redundant role in release of neutrophils into the circulation during I/R, which may be a general phenomenon during acute resolving/selflimiting inflammation.",

            "text": "Previous studies indicate an important homeostatic role of Cxcl5 in maintaining bone marrow neutrophil numbers [34] . However, our study shows no apparent sex difference in homeostatic functions of Cxcl5 since the levels and cell populations are similar in untreated male and female controls (data not shown) and in shamoperated animals. We only observe disparities in the functional role of Cxcl5 in males and females in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli where a temporal relationship between production of Cxcl5 and extent of neutrophil infiltration into tissue intimates a causal relation. Cxcl5 is an upstream regulator of GCSF production within bone marrow in vivo [35] . Similarly, in the current study, application of Cxcl5 to isolated bone marrow cells in vitro induced substantial expression of GCSF and neutrophil \u03b22 integrin. Surprisingly, these effects on cell surface \u03b22 integrin were greater in male than those in female cells despite similar basal levels of receptor Cxcr2 expression as confirmed by greater capacity of male cells to adhere to purified integrin ligand ICAM-1. Thus, male bone marrow cells have increased sensitivity to Cxcl5 through disparate Cxcr2 signaling; the precise mechanism is not elucidated in the current study but merits further investigation. Nonetheless, this important finding indicates that even in situations where Cxcl5 levels are elevated in females, circulating neutrophils are likely to have a less adhesive phenotype compared to neutrophils in males. The effect of Cxcl5 is clearly more potent than Cxcl1 in either sex, in agreement with previous reports indicating that truncated forms of Cxcl5 have greater affinity for CXCR2 than other ligands [36] . Administration of Cxcl5 also induces its own expression as well as its receptor, which suggests that Cxcl5 appears to work in a positive feedback loop to enhance and prolong synthesis at a transcriptional level. This may underlie differential kinetics of this chemokine whereby Cxcl5 has a longer half-life than other ELR+ chemokines. For example in acute endotoxemia in mice, Cxcl5 expression remains elevated longer than Cxcl1 and Cxcl2 in almost all tissues [37] . Moreover in severe inflammation, Cxcl5 production prolongs the activity of Cxcl1 and Cxcl2 by establishing local chemokine gradients and thereby promoting tissue injury [34] .",

Similar to our findings in rat mesenteric I/R, greater Cxcl5 expression was evident in the kidneys of male mice compared to females at the end of reperfusion and associated with elevated numbers of circulating neutrophils with higher \u03b22 integrin expression. It is important to note that the induction of ischemia itself may be different in females since sex hormones, in particular estrogens, can limit the production of tissue-damaging mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and thereby increase tolerance to ischemia and reduce the inflammatory response (for review, see [38] ). However, we observed the same divergent regulation of Cxcl5-dependent neutrophil responses in males and females following administration of equivalent amount of a chemical stimulus (carrageenan) into the pleural cavity of rats. Increased expression of Cxcl5 in the lung tissue and bone marrow of males was also associated with greater lung edema. Overall, our data imply that distinct regulation of Cxcl5 induction in males is a general phenomenon during I/R and other acute inflammatory responses that result in enhanced neutrophil accumulation and tissue injury.",

Our study in human volunteers supports the thesis that sex-specific regulation of CXCL6 underlies increased neutrophil recruitment in males. Topical application of cantharidin in healthy volunteers disrupts intercellular connections between keratinocytes and stimulates the influx of leukocytes, predominantly neutrophils, within 24 h [39] . While there is variation in the magnitude of leukocyte recruitment into blisters between individuals, the extent of neutrophil (but not monocyte) influx and edema is greater in men. Despite the small sample size, in agreement with our studies in rodents, local amounts of CXCL6 within the blister fluid are correlated with neutrophil accumulation and tend to be greater in men. Therefore, together, our findings indicate that reduced production and sensitivity to Cxcl5/6 may underlie a fundamental tissue-sparing mechanism in acute inflammatory responses in women. Furthermore, Cxcl5/6 may be an important therapeutic target in perturbing acute inflammatory diseases as well as a biochemical marker of disease progression.",

            "text": "Sex differences in regulation of CXCL6 may have important consequences for progression of acute inflammatory disorders. Few studies of human disease have investigated the biological role of CXCL6; however, ortholog CXCL5/ENA78 is involved in a variety of inflammatory diseases such as ARDS [40, 41] , acute coronary syndromes, inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, and psoriasis, diseases known to have a neutrophil component. Serum levels of chemokine CXCL5 have also been associated with intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery, a marker of preclinical atherosclerosis, and CXCL5 levels are reduced by anti-inflammatory statin therapy [42] . Whether CXCL5 activity underlies sex differences in acute inflammatory disorders is not known. However, polymorphisms in CXCL5 gene are correlated with acute coronary syndrome [43] , a disease where more numerous plaque-destabilizing neutrophils have been observed in lesions of men compared to women. We suggest that our findings indicate a role for increased CXCL5/6 induction in males in contributing to sex differences in inflammatory disorders that are characterized by excessive neutrophil recruitment.",

Our study does not distinguish whether male factors increase Cxcl5/6 or whether female factors inhibit Cxcl5/6. Current evidence indicates complex and interacting influences of sex on inflammatory responses including multiple sex hormones, X-linked and Y-linked genes (for reviews, see [3, 44, 45] ), although no unifying explanation exists since these factors may paradoxically be pro-or antiinflammatory depending on cell type, stimulus, stage of response, and age. Thus, to fully understand how sex differences in neutrophil responses are brought about, future studies need to examine the impact of individual sex hormones and chromosomes on regulation of chemokine production and neutrophil trafficking. Moreover, although our data demonstrate that the male neutrophil response can be made \"female\" by acutely blocking endogenous Cxcl5, it remains to be shown whether Cxcl5 alone is sufficient to make a female neutrophil response identical to that in males. In the current study, we primarily focused on the role of chemokine production on sex differences in neutrophil dynamics in the onset phases of leukocyte recruitment.",

However, several other components of the inflammatory response may also be differentially regulated between the sexes and contribute to greater neutrophil accumulation in male tissues. For example, it is possible that differences in leukocyte cytoskeleton integrity or function may affect leukocyte motility and impede the recruitment of female leukocytes into tissues or their release from the bone marrow due to differences in signaling of adhesion molecules such as PSGL-1 and L-selectin or a difference in the ability of neutrophils to deform and transmigrate. Previous studies also indicate that female sex hormones can influence the life span of neutrophils [46] , a finding that may have implications for the number of neutrophils in the circulation and tissue, particularly in later stages of inflammation. Our data suggest greater Cxcl5/ 6 production in males in different inflammatory models in three species; however, further investigations with larger sample size will be needed to fully establish the existence and consequence of differential Cxcl5/6 production between the sexes in inflammatory disorders. Detailed understanding of fundamental differences in male and female neutrophil responses may lead to improved anti-inflammatory therapies.",
