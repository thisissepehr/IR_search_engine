Typical Lemierre's syndrome begins with pharyngotonsillitis, followed by unilateral swelling and tenderness along the sternocleidomastoid muscle, owing to septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein [1, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Postanginal F. necrophorum septicaemia with high fever and metastatic lung abscesses often develops within a week [1, 3, [5] [6] [7] [8] [10] [11] [12] . Lemierre claimed that the syndrome is so characteristic, that the clinical diagnosis is nearly impossible to mistake [1] . He also wrote that anaerobic septicaemia arising from otitis media and buccal suppuration following from infected teeth had clinical manifestations very similar to postanginal septicaemias, and that these infections were remarkably similar, irrespective of the primary focus [1] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 150, "end": 153, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 373, "end": 376, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 587, "end": 590, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 591, "end": 594, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 595, "end": 598, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 599, "end": 602, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 603, "end": 606, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 607, "end": 610, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 611, "end": 614, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 615, "end": 618, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 735, "end": 738, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 739, "end": 741, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 742, "end": 745, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 746, "end": 749, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 750, "end": 753, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 754, "end": 757, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 758, "end": 762, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 763, "end": 767, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 768, "end": 772, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 892, "end": 895, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1173, "end": 1176, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The definition of Lemierre's syndrome is not yet clear in the literature.
