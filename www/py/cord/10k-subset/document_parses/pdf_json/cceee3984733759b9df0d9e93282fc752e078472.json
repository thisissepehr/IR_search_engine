Although there was insufficient data to develop a scoring system for mortality prediction, it was noted in this review that serum markers of acute inflammation (tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1, interleukin-6) have not been adequately assessed as prognostic markers. These pro-inflammatory cytokines lead to an increase in the activity of inducible nitric oxide synthatase (iNOS) to synthesize nitric oxide (NO) which is toxic to the bacterium. The role of iNOS and NO production in inflammation has not been clearly determined in leptospirosis; in fact its significance in severe sepsis [7] and other infections such as malaria [8] [9] [10] [11] is subject to much debate [12, 13] . While its primary role is to combat infection, NO levels have been shown to be elevated in severe leptospirosis [14] , leading to the postulate that high NO levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of organ dysfunction in leptospirosis.

NO x levels in blood are affected by the amount of ingested nitrates; to control for this, measurements should ideally be made after an overnight fast [17] .

Furthermore, the results suggest that iNOS activity is similar in severe leptospirosis and healthy controls despite the heavy inflammatory response in the former group. We postulate that this indicates that a blunted iNOS response is seen in severe leptospirosis; whether this is the result of the inflammatory response that occurs, or whether a diminished iNOS response plays a role in the genesis of severe leptospirosis and organ dysfunction remains to be elucidated. Conversely, it is possible that higher levels of NOx are protective against organ dysfunction. Admittedly, the relationship between iNOS activity and inflammation is extremely complex.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Nonetheless, similar patterns have been seen in malaria. Al Yaman et al. [10] described an association between high levels of NO x levels and coma in children with cerebral malaria. Similarly Kremsner et al. [9] showed that higher levels of plasma NO were seen in severe malaria; however they also demonstrated that higher levels of NO was associated with accelerated recovery. The criticism of both these studies was that crude NO levels were considered, and no correction was made for deranged renal function (serum creatinine levels in the patients were not provided), and that the elevated NO levels could simply be related to reduced excretion of NO due to impairment of renal function [13] . In fact, Anstey et al. [11] demonstrated that when NO x levels were corrected for renal function, using the ratio NO x /Creatinine, NO x levels showed an inverse relationship with the severity of malaria. Corrected NO x levels were lowest in patients with severe disease, while higher levels were seen in controls as well as those with asymptomatic disease, suggesting that high NO x levels may protect against severe malaria. Furthermore, in a mouse model, Gramaglia et al. [26] demonstrated that low NO bioavailability contributes to the genesis of experimental cerebral malaria. Although many confounding factors could be present, the finding that corrected NO x levels are low in clinically severe leptospirosis is itself of significance. Whether NO x levels are low in severe leptospirosis as a result of endothelial dysfunction resulting from severe disease, or whether individuals in whom iNOS activity does not increase in response to infection are more likely to develop severe disease remains unclear. Another possibility is that iNOS activity is normal, but the NO produced is rapidly removed by other molecules such as reactive oxygen species and haemoglobin. The measurement of serial NO x levels and correlating these with the onset of organ dysfunction in patients with leptospirosis and in experimental models is likely to provide further insight into this issue.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 73, "end": 77, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 208, "end": 211, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 691, "end": 695, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 721, "end": 725, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1173, "end": 1177, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The finding that corrected NO x levels in NLFs were similar to those seen in severe leptospirosis is interesting.

Clinical features similar to those of severe leptospirosis occur in many other infections, such as dengue, hanta-virus and acute hepatitis; some of the patients in the NLF and MAT equivocal groups did present with clinical features similar to severe leptospirosis; however numbers were too small for any realistic comparisons of NO levels in these subgroups to be possible.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The Griess reaction explained in the methodology is specific for nitrite levels in blood.

It was also possible that patients with severe disease had a lower dietary contribution of nitrites. This is very difficult to quantify in a clinical study, and no standard methods for quantification exist. However in our study, we compared the incidence and severity of symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite, and there was no difference in the incidence of these symptoms in severe disease compared with non-severe disease. All patients, even the sickest, were able to eat and drink. There was a gender bias in the sample with more males than females.
