            "text": "In 1956, Lyell reported four cases of a skin eruption resembling scalding and related to either drug toxicity, staphylococcal infection, or undetermined etiology [1] . In fact, this original article included three different diseases corresponding to staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, generalized fixed eruptions due to drugs, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) [2, 3] . With further cases and larger series, it became generally accepted that TEN was a drug-induced skin reaction. The main drugs incriminated in T E N are antibacterial sulfonamides, anticonvulsants, some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and allopurinol [4] [5] [6] . In a few cases, T E N has been demonstrated to be related to Mycoplasma infection [7] or graft-versus-host disease (GVH) [8] . T E N is characterized by extensive epidermal detachment with mucous membrane involvement (Fig. 1) , whereas the Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) corresponds to a mild form of TEN with predominant mucosal involvement but epidermal detachment affecting less than 10 % of the body surface area. TEN is rare since its incidence is estimated to be in the range of 1 to 1.5 cases/million per year. However, it is a life-threatening disease, fatal in 30 % of cases, and death is mainly related to sepsis or visceral involvement such as gastrointestinal or pulmonary complications [9, 10] . Pulmonary manifestations have been poorly studied but appear to be heterogeneous, including specific bronchial mucosal necrosis, pulmonary edema, and infectious pneumonitis, as described in a few isolated case reports or rare postmortem studies [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . The aim of the present study was therefore to evaluate the incidence of pulmonary manifestations in TEN, to define their clinical characteristics, and to determine their prognosis in a large prospective series.",

Cases of T E N associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection, Mycoplasma pneumonitis, or G V H disease were not included. Patients were clinically classified as overlap SJS-TEN when the epidermal detachment ranged from 10 to 30 % of BSA and as T E N when the epidermal detachment exceeded 30 % of BSA [16] . The diagnosis was confirmed by a skin biopsy showing detachment of full thickness epidermis and/or total epidermal necrosis. Drug causality was assessed according to the official method of the French Pharmacovigilance Centers [17] .",

In patients with ARDS, volume-controlled ventilation using 7 to 10 ml/kg tidal volume was performed in order to keep the pressure plateau below 35 cm H20. Positioning of these patients (supine/prone) was not routinely performed since the ben-efit of this strategy has not been proved. Moreover, skin lesions made it difficult to turn these patients. In contrast, the 27 patients with no early respiratory symptoms or hypoxemia did not require ventilatory support in the course of the disease. However, in absence of respiratory symptoms, FOB was not performed and therefore we cannot exclude the possibility of bronchial involvement in group 1. Interestingly, FOB was performed in 7 patients who developed only delayed complications between day 5 and day 10 after the onset of TEN, an interval which would reasonably exclude the possibility of early re-epithelialization. No bronchial mucosal detachment was observed in these 7 patients. Such results therefore suggest that bronchial involvement is associated with early respiratory symptoms and marked hypoxemia developing simultaneously with or very soon after the onset of skin manifestations. Furthermore, bronchial mucosal involvement seems to be related to a poor prognosis, constituting a high risk factor for acute respiratory failure.",

Histological findings were characterized by extensive necrosis of bronchial epithelium without any alteration of basement membrane or lamina propria. Cell alterations consistent with viral infection such as cell ballooning, viral inclusion, giant cells, or syncytia formation were absent. Moreover, bacterial analysis of bronchial protected samples remained negative, leading us to consider that an infectious process was unlikely. Interestingly, airway sloughing and skin detachment appeared to be synchronous and both regenerated over the same time interval, suggesting \"specific\" TEN bronchial epithelial involvement.",

Cell-mediated cytotoxicity has been suggested by infiltration of inflammatory cells in areas of epidermal necrolysis [20, 21] . Among these ceils, monocytes/macrophages and T-cell lymphocytes infiltrating dermis and epidermis could play a crucial role via local TNFa and cytotoxic secretion [22] [23] [24] . It is noteworthy that the predominant inflammatory cells infiltrating bronchial mucosa in patients developing \"specific\" TEN bronchial mucosal involvement mainly consisted of mononuclear cells. Recent studies have emphasized the role of the toxicity of metabolites of offending drugs [25, 26] . Such variations of metabolism could be related to genetic susceptibility [26, 27] . Toxic and immunological mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, since cell-mediated cytotoxicity might develop against toxic metabolites [28] .",

They mainly consisted of pulmonary edema and infectious pneumonitis. The mechanisms of pulmonary edema were not clearly established in our series. Although alteration of the bronchopulmonary epithelial barrier can be suspected in patients with bronchial mucosal detachment, fluid overload seems to occur more frequently in pulmonary edema since treatment of TEN requires a large fluid intake, including water, electrolytes, and macromolecular solutions [5] . Moreover, fluid balance control is not easily obtained, since central venous pressure monitoring is avoided due to the risk of systemic infection [29] .",

Interestingly, we found a good correlation between bacteria isolated from the skin and those iso-lated from lung samples by PTC. Such findings could be useful to treat bacterial pneumonitis empirically before complete identification of the pathogens responsible for pneumonitis. In conclusion, the present study indicates that bronchial epithelial necrosis occurs in about 25 % of cases of TEN and corresponds to a specific TEN-related disorder. This bronchial involvement appears to be an index of poor prognosis, as demonstrated by the short-term progression toward acute respiratory failure and the frequent development of delayed complications. Therefore FOB appears to be useful in patients with suspected pulmonary complications: (i) to identify bronchial involvement, (ii) to evaluate the prognosis, and (iii) to eliminate associated pneumonitis using appropriate bacterial sampling. Moreover, bronchial aspiration during FOB prevents atelectasis produced by sloughing of bronchial epithelium. To our knowledge, there is no demonstrated specific treatment for TEN and obviously for bronchial involvement. Further prospective studies would be required to determine the value of early ventilatory support to reduce early mortality related to the progression of pulmonary complications.",
