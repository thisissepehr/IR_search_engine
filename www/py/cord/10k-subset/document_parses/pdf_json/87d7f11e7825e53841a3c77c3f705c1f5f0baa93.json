Therefore, intense searching of new leading structures and active substances, which may be used as new drugs, especially against strain resistant to all available therapeutics, is very important. Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) has attracted a lot of attention as a molecular target for bacterial resistance over several decades, resulting in a number of useful agents. Trimethoprim (TMP), (2,4-diamino-5-(3\u2032,4\u2032,5\u2032-trimethoxybenzyl)pyrimidine) is the well-known dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor and one of the standard antibiotics used in urinary tract infections (UTIs). This review highlights advances in design, synthesis, and biological evaluations in structural modifications of TMP as DHFR inhibitors. In addition, this report presents the differences in the active site of human and pathogen DHFR. Moreover, an excellent review of DHFR inhibition and their relevance to antimicrobial and parasitic chemotherapy was presented.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria are significant global healthcare problem. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of drug resistance is one of the most important trends underway research both in the treatment of infectious diseases, as well as work on treatment methods of cancer [1, 2] . The molecular target connecting these equally important directions of research is dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme that catalyzes the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate (7, 6, 7, in microbial and eukaryotes cells [3] . The crucial role of DHFR is related to biosynthesis pathways of the thymidylate and purines, as well as several other amino acids like glycine, methionine, serine, and N-formyl-methionyl tRNA [4] [5] [6] . Inhibition of folate metabolizing enzymes leads to an imbalance in the pathways involved in active synthesizing thymidylate, disrupts DNA replication, and eventually causes cell death [7] . Therefore, DHFR is a very good example of a well-established molecular target of new active compounds, which could be approved as antibacterial drugs and therapeutic agents against variety of fatal disorders e.g., cancer [8, 9] . Several classes of compounds have been explored for their potential antifolate activity, among the most outstanding are diaminopyrimidine [10, 11] , diaminoquinazolin [12] , diaminopteridine [13] , and also diaminotriazines [14] . Inhibitors of DHFR characterize widespread application in the treatment of cancer and rheumatoid arthritis (methotrexate, MTX), bacterial DHFR enzyme (trimethoprim, TMP), and Plasmodium falciparum (pf)DHFR (pyrimethamine, PYR). However, the most successful inhibitor against bacterial DHFR is TMP that belongs to the diaminopyrimidine class of compounds [15] . This review summarizes the field of structural modifications of TMP analogues and other nonclassical antifolates as a wide group of DHFR inhibitors. Moreover, we present first and most recent attempts to develop a potent and selective structure targeting infections caused by the bacterial, protozoan, fungal infections, and malaria disease and several of other directions e.g., leishmaniasis, African trypanosomiasis, Chagas' disease, cancer, rheumatoid disease, and perspectives.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 300, "end": 303, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 304, "end": 306, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 561, "end": 564, "text": "(7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 565, "end": 567, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 568, "end": 570, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 605, "end": 608, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 803, "end": 806, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 807, "end": 810, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 811, "end": 814, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1001, "end": 1004, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1228, "end": 1231, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1232, "end": 1234, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1375, "end": 1379, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1380, "end": 1383, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1404, "end": 1408, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1428, "end": 1432, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1461, "end": 1465, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1822, "end": 1826, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "TMP, (2,4-diamino-5-(3\u2032,4\u2032,5\u2032-trimethoxybenzyl)-pyrimidine) is the well-known DHFR inhibitor and widely prescribed antimicrobial agent (Fig. 1 ). This synthetic antimicrobial drug was fully described by Roth et al. [16] and has been used clinically since the 1960s [17] . TMP belongs to a group of antibacterial agents called diaminopyrimidines [5, 18] . During the process of DHFR-TMP binding, the protonated aminopyrimidine group of TMP interacts with the carboxylate group of the enzyme, via a pair of N-H\u2026O hydrogen bonds, generating a hydrogenbonded ring motif [19] . Matthews et al. [20] based X-ray crystallography studies confirmed, that TMP binds differently at the active sites of chicken (vertebrate enzyme) and Escherichia coli (ecDHFR). Analysis of these data permits identification of differences that are important in accounting for TMP's selectivity. A key finding of these results was that residues on opposite sides of the active-site cleft in chicken DHFR are about 1.5-2.0 A further apart than are structurally equivalent residues in the E. coli enzyme. The X-ray structural results strongly suggest that loss of a potential hydrogen bond between the 4-amino group of TMP and the backbone carbonyl of Val115 in enzyme is the major factor responsible for this drug to be more potent inhibition of bacterial DHFR [20] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 215, "end": 219, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 265, "end": 269, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 345, "end": 348, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 349, "end": 352, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 566, "end": 570, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 589, "end": 593, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1331, "end": 1335, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 135, "end": 142, "text": "(Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "TMP-clinical usage and main mechanisms of resistance"}, {"text": "TMP administrated alone inhibits the growth of a wide range of bacteria [21] .

This drug is used extensively in various parts of the world alone or in combination with sulfamethoxazole (SMX) for the treatment of respiratory, enteric, or skin ailments [24, 26, 27] . Navarro-Martinez et al. [28] reported that TMP also inhibited Candida albicans DHFR (caDHFR) by competing with 7,8-dihydrofolate although the value of inhibitory constant for C. albicans enzyme is 7000-fold greater than E. coli enzyme. TMP is the gold standard of treatment of UTIs and uncomplicated UTIs in women, which is caused mainly by E. coli, but also by Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp., other Enterobacteriaceae spp. and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (5% each) [29] [30] [31] .

TMP alone has only weak activity against the DHFR of P. carinii [35, 36] . TMP-SMX combination is used for the treatment of UTI, although increasing resistance trends among uropathogens, primarily E. coli, complicate the choice of antibiotics in the outpatient management of UTI and among a large number of microorganisms, including P. carinii [25, 37, 38] . Furthermore, Stuck et al. [39] reported that resistance for standard combination TMP-SMX in the treatment of UTI cause choice of quinolones in 78,5% of cases. In turn, a large number of studies have described the results of in vitro antifungal activity of TMP-SMX combination against clinical isolates, such as Aspergillus fumigatus, Cryptococcus neoformans [31] . Afeltra et al. [40] showed that SMX is active in vitro against A. fumigatus and therefore might help to prevent invasive aspergillosis in AIDS patients receiving SXT prophylaxis. In successive studies the same team of researchers evaluate the in vitro activities of seven different sulfa compounds and pentamidine (PNT) against Aspergillus isolates comprising six different species in two different media. As reported, SMX, sulfadiazine, and PNT were active in vitro however more studies with different media and animal models and clinical studies are necessary to elucidate the potential of these drugs for the treatment of Aspergillus infections [41] . In contrast, Hanafy et al. [42] reported that SMX showed moderate activity against both strains of A. fumigatus and C. neoformans var. grubii (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were 32-128 \u03bcg ml \u22121 ). In this report, sulfaphenazole showed the highest activity (MIC values for A. fumigatus and C. neoformans var. grubii were respectively, 64 \u03bcg ml \u22121 and 4-8 \u03bcg ml \u22121 ). In other report, Ajayi et al. [43] presented the successful treatment of group of children with orbital histoplasmosis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum var. duboisii (one unsuccessfully treated with amphotericin-B) with a combination of TMP and sulphamethoxazole (Septrin) and surgical drainage. Treatment was devoid of side effects and all patients improved markedly during therapy with resolution of the lesions, and with no recurrence of infection in three patients. These findings suggested that Septrin could be a safe alternative to amphotericin-B for the treatment of African histoplasmosis [43] . As an ingredient in cotrimoxazole, TMP is used extensively for the prophylaxis and/or therapy of potentially life-threatening opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS. What is notable, a major drawback to the use of TMP-sulfa combinations in immunocompromised patients is the occurrence of hypersensitivity reactions to the sulfa drug that can be severe enough to require discontinuation of treatment, when the side effects cannot be managed with steroids [44, 45] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 252, "end": 256, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 323, "end": 327, "text": "[35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 328, "end": 331, "text": "36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 603, "end": 607, "text": "[25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 608, "end": 611, "text": "37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 612, "end": 615, "text": "38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 644, "end": 648, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 976, "end": 980, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 998, "end": 1002, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1631, "end": 1635, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1665, "end": 1669, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 2050, "end": 2054, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2618, "end": 2622, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 3087, "end": 3091, "text": "[44,", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 3092, "end": 3095, "text": "45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "TMP-clinical usage and main mechanisms of resistance"}, {"text": "The main mechanisms of resistance to TMP includes the production of additional plasmids-, transposons-, cassettesmediated drug-resistant DHFR [23, 46] , impermeability (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens) [47, 48] , alternative metabolic pathways and overproduction of resistant chromosomal DHFR enzyme [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 142, "end": 146, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 147, "end": 150, "text": "46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 213, "end": 217, "text": "[47,", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 218, "end": 221, "text": "48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 311, "end": 315, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 316, "end": 320, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 321, "end": 325, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 326, "end": 330, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 331, "end": 335, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "TMP-clinical usage and main mechanisms of resistance"}, {"text": "Podnecky et al.

So far 30 dfr-genes usually associated with integrons are described [56] . Integrons are integrated in transposons predominantly located on plasmids and can insert, excise, and express mobile gene cassettes, often antibiotic resistance genes. This results in an efficient horizontal spread of antibiotic resistance between bacteria [57, 58] . Overproduction of chromosomal DHFR caused by promoter mutation has reportedly occurred in E. coli. A single amino acid substitution in the dhfr gene and altered chromosomally encoded DHFR has been considered responsible for resistance to TMP [59] . It was determined that a single point mutation in the DHFR enzymes, be it transposon, plasmid, or chromosomally encoded is responsible for the reduced susceptibility of Staphylococci to TMP. The single amino acid substitution Phe to Tyr in the Staphylococcus aureus strain B71 (F98Y) resulted in a 64-fold increase in the MIC of TMP for the strain [60] . This mutation resulted in the loss of a single hydrogen bond between the 4-amino group of TMP and the enzyme. The decrease in affinity was identified as the mechanism of resistance at the protein level [61, 62] . In turn, resistance of TMP among Streptococcus pneumoniae is determined by mutations to the DHFR gene caused by six amino acid changes (Glu20-Asp, Pro70-Ser, Gln81-His, Asp92-Ala, Ile100-Leu, and Leu135-Phe) [63] . In strains of TMP-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, changes in both promoter and coding regions of the dhfr genes have been found [64] . In case of Gram-positive bacteria it has been detected several horizontally transmissible dfrgenes, e.g., dfrG have been identified in one of the emm1-2.2 clinical isolates Streptococcus pyogenes [65, 66] . Moreover DHFR encoded by dfrA was found in S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus [67] [68] [69] . Currently more than 25 variants of dfrA gene resistance have been reported [70, 71] . Tang et al. [72] found and reported in K. pneumoniae, in a single putative multireplicon plasmid pHS0091147, the coexistence of blaKPC-2 and dfrA25, which carried five resistance genes (blaKPC-2, blaCTA-M-14, blaTEM-1, sul1, and dfrA25). In turn, Bosse et al. [73] reported on the presence of the mobilize plasmids dfrA14 in the Pasteurellaceae spp. In addition, widely reported PCR assays confirmed, that mobilize plasmids conferred TMP resistance in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae TMP-insensitive Staphylococci spp. and Gram-negative bacteria [62] . The most frequent mechanisms responsible for acquired resistance to TMP alone or with combination with SMX have been described [53] . The wide spectrum of TMP action used in monotherapy and in combination with SMX confirms its great importance as an antibiotic. On the other hand, constantly increasing resistance is a negative prognosis. This fact is the reason for searching for new, more selective active compounds, obtained by different structures modifications. TMP as a drug used for decades is an excellent target, amplified by the broad-spectrum activity and inhibiting of the key enzyme DHFR for prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms.

Understanding the known mechanism of resistance to TMP led to the design of iclaprim (Ro 48-2622, AR-100), a new inhibitor with improved affinity towards the S. aureus DHFR ( Fig. 1 ) [87] . This novel 2,4diaminopyrimidine exhibits potent, rapid bactericidal activity against major Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, MRSA, and F98Y TMPresistant strains. Iclaprim binds and inhibits bacterial DHFR in a similar manner to TMP [60, 65] . Oefner et al. [88] based enzyme binding and X-ray crystallographic studies elucidated the binding mode of iclaprim. It was reported that the increased hydrophobic interactions between iclaprim and DHFR account for increased affinity and, unlike TMP, enable iclaprim to inhibit even the resistant enzyme with nanomolar affinity, thus overcoming the mechanism of TMP resistance [88] . Moreover, this analog presented activity in case of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains, penicillin-susceptible pneumococci, \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci, enterococci, as well as Legionella, Listeria and Chlamydia spp, but showed moderate activity against some Enterobacteriaceae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] .

[103] noticed that the 3deazatrimethoprim analog 4 (I 50 = 140 \u00b5M; pKa = 9.03 \u00b1 0.02) ( Table 1 ) was about 300-fold less active as an inhibitor of ecDHFR than TMP (pKa = 7.1) [102] , however 4\u2032demethyl analog 5 (I 50 = 37 \u00b5M) was about four times more active than 4. It was reported that the considerable loss of activity was affected by replacement of the N-3 atom of TMP by carbon, but is not related to the increased basicity of analog 4. The derivative 5 appeared more active than 4, but it was about one-half less active as TMP [92] . Later studies of TMP analogues included incorporating the para substituent in the benzene ring ( Table 1 ). All of these compounds were identified as very potent in vitro inhibitors of ecDHFR and the compounds all have I 50ecDHFR values between 0.5 and 2.0 \u00b5M. Allyloxy derivative 9 (I 50ecDHFR = 0.52 \u00b5M) and \u03b3-chloropropoxy 10 (I 50ecDHFR = 0.5 \u00b5M) had activities fairly close to that of TMP (I 50ecDHFR = 0.5-0.7 \u00b5M). Compound 6 (I 50ecDHFR = 37.0 \u00b5M) with an anionic carboxyl functionality, indicated significantly lower activity because of hydrophobic bonding between inhibitor and protein, and also interfered by hydration sheath surrounding the ionized center. The carboxymethyl derivative 7 (I 50ecDHFR = 6.2 \u00b5M) did not cause these disturbances because the charge center was far enough away from the ring. The diversity in side chains resulted in similar activity as TMP [104] . Kompis et al. [105] provided additional supporting data for these conclusions. Their 4\u2032-carboxy and 4\u2032-(aminomethyl) derivatives, for example, both of which have their charged centers within two atoms of the benzene ring, were found to be considerably less active than compound 7. Significantly, the differences in activity were apparently related rather to the size of the substituent than to the polarity or lipophilicity [105] . Derivative 8 (I 50ecDHFR = 5.6 \u00b5M) is significantly less active than the others (one-tenth that of TMP) [104] . Compound 9 appeared to be the most attractive and also very active as an inhibitor of ecDHFR. Furthermore, compounds 9 and 10 were selected for in vivo antibacterial studies in mice and pharmacokinetic investigations in dogs. This report proved that TMP and two selected analogues were rapidly absorbed but extensively metabolized (10% of the dose excreted in the urine as the intact drug in 24 h). In addition, TMP had longer plasma t 1/2 than any of the analogues and also greatest bioavailability. It was suggested that 4\u2032ether chain of TMP with three types of substitutions has apparently created greater opportunity for metabolism, causing more rapid elimination and decreased bioavailability. Compounds 9 and 10 could be interesting for human and veterinary medicines because of their antibacterial activity and physicochemical properties [104] . It was reported that the aliphatic ether derivatives had less activity against rat liver DHFR (rlDHFR) than compounds lacking the ether chain (8, 11, 13 ; I 50rlDHFR = 9000; 12000; 9200 \u00b5M respectively). This effect was caused by the out of plane \u03b1-carbon, which interfered with binding to the mammalian DHFR, in contrast to bacterial enzyme [104] . Compound 12 (I 50rlDHFR = 12000 \u00b5M) involving the 4\u2032-ethyl group provided evidence for the same trend. However, it will be noted that structure 14 (I 50rlDHFR = 58000 \u00b5M), which contained the more lipophilic substituent was in vitro active against the Gram-positive organisms [104] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 15, "end": 20, "text": "[103]", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 191, "end": 196, "text": "[102]", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 549, "end": 553, "text": "[92]", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}, {"start": 1436, "end": 1441, "text": "[104]", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 1458, "end": 1463, "text": "[105]", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 1868, "end": 1873, "text": "[105]", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 1980, "end": 1985, "text": "[104]", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 2833, "end": 2838, "text": "[104]", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 2983, "end": 2986, "text": "(8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2987, "end": 2990, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2991, "end": 2993, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 3183, "end": 3188, "text": "[104]", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 3467, "end": 3472, "text": "[104]", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 103, "end": 110, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 653, "end": 660, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "First attempts to obtain TMP derivatives"}, {"text": "In the successive report, Stuart et al. [106] presented an evaluation of the various methoxy substitution effects ( Table 1 ). The 2,3,4-trimethoxy analog of TMP (15) was compared with compounds: 16 bearing the 3,4-dimethoxy groups and ortho-substituted isomeric dihydrobenzofuran derivatives 17 and 18. It was reported that compound 15 (values of 50% inhibn ecDHFR = 92; 50% inhibn rlDHFR = 5800) was 6-fold more in vitro active than TMP (values of 50% inhibn ecDHFR = 0.7; DHFR50% inhibn rlDHFR = 34000) against the rat liver enzyme but considerably less active than analog 16 (values of 50% inhibn ecDHFR = 0.6; 50% inhibn rlDHFR = 8600) against ecDHFR. It was also found, that the lack of a 5-or 3-substituent of 16 would be the cause of low activity against ecDHFR [106] . In another report, Roth et al. [107] analyzed terms of inhibitory in vitro activities against four DHFR isoenzymes: ecDHFR, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (ngDHFR), P. berghei (pbDHFR), and rlDHFR. Derivatives with n-propyl or isopropyl substitutes at the 3-and 5-positions were more active than TMP against ngDHFR. It was found, that TMP derivatives selectivity were lower than the standard compound. These studies revealed, that the activities against rlDHFR were at least 2 orders of magnitude less than against enzymes from bacterial strains. In turn, the profiles of activity were different for ecDHFR but remarkably similar for rlDHFR, ngDHFR, and pbDHFR in all three series. In addition the selectivity for this enzyme was dependent on the nature of the 4-substituent, high polar in case 4-amino analogues and low for 4-hydroxy compounds, possibly as a result of solvation differences [107] . With complex substituents, the environment of each atom in the active site must be taken into account to adequately explain SARs e.g., methylene moiety will be largely in contact with solvent, but the solvated hydroxyl function, particularly if in the 5-(down) position, will require desolvation to interact favorably with the hydrophobic side chains of the enzyme, which costs energy [107] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 40, "end": 45, "text": "[106]", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 770, "end": 775, "text": "[106]", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 809, "end": 814, "text": "[107]", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 1661, "end": 1666, "text": "[107]", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 2054, "end": 2059, "text": "[107]", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 116, "end": 123, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "First attempts to obtain TMP derivatives"}, {"text": "In addition, 3,4,5-triethyl analog 19 (I 50ecDHFR = 0.3 \u00b5M; I 50rlDHFR = 3000 \u00b5M; I 50ngDHFR = 22 \u00b5M; I 50pgDHFR = 0.75 \u00b5M) ( Table 1 ) and TMP (I 50ecDHFR = 0.7 \u00b5M; I 50rlDHFR = 3700 \u00b5M; I 50ngDHFR = 45 \u00b5M; I 50pgDHFR = 12 \u00b5M) characterized very close activity in case ecDHFR.

Roth et al.

In vitro antibacterial activity against ten selected organisms in relation to TMP (I 50ngDHFR = 45 \u00b5M; MIC = 240 \u03bcg ml \u22121 ) data showed, that the tested compounds in serial dilutions were carried out at levels of 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, etc., and differences of \u00b11 dilution were significantly less active than TMP, particularly against Gram-negative organisms.

It was observed that 8-ethyl derivative 26 showed in vitro the best inhibitory properties expressed as I 50 values (I 50ecDHFR = 0.24; I 50rlDHFR = 4400; I 50ngDHFR = 90) and also about 3-6 fold greater than 25 (I 50ecDHFR = 0.68; I 50rlDHFR = 25000; I 50ngDHFR = 89) against the ecDHFR, rlDHFR, and N. gonorrhoeae (ngDHFR) enzymes [110] . In vitro antibacterial activities of compounds 25 and 26, expressed as a ratio when compared with TMP activity. Serial dilutions of 1-3-10-30\u2026etc. were carried out, and the MICs were divided by that of TMP. These compounds were more active against the Gram-positive organisms (S. aureus and Streptococcus faecalis) than TMP, where (MIC Compound / MIC TMP ratio for 25 and 26 were 1;03 and 0,03;0,03). The compounds 31 and 32, the 4-methyl-8-methoxy and 2,4dimethyl-8-methoxy analogues, have the same activity as standard in case S. aureus and MIC Compound /MIC TMP ratio were equal 1 [110] . In addition, the high activity against Proteus species e.g., Proteus vulgaris and P. mirabilis is to be noted in particular. The 4-methyl derivative 30 (MIC Compound /MIC TMP ratio in case P. vulgaris and P. mirabilis were equal 1) and its 8-methoxy-congener 28 (MIC Compound /MIC TMP ratio in case P. vulgaris and P. mirabilis were equal 3) also had similar activity [110] . Furthermore, the unsubstituted compound 27 also presented excellent properties in activity (MIC Compound /MIC TMP ratio in case P. vulgaris and P. mirabilis were equal 10 and 3 respectively) [110] . Based on stereo view of TMP in ternary complex with active site of E. coli DHFR and NADPH, Ruckman et al. [110] suggested that avoidance of bulky side chains (for example, 29), as well as simplicity of aromatic substitution, aid to effective penetration through the bacterial cell wall. Moreover, it was observed, that the specificity for bacterial DHFR was considerably increased in the tetrahydroquinoline series compared with its aromatic analogues [110] . These conclusions were observed in previous report of Painter's team, where was attempting to adjust log P values of side chains to aid passage into cells, shapes, and bulk are considered as well [111] . Davis et al. [112] designed compounds 33-36 ( Fig. 4) with basic or methoxy substituents at the 2-or 4positions of the quinoline ring, expecting the highest level of antibacterial selectivity. It was found that all of the 6quinolyl-1-methyl derivatives exhibited highly in vitro inhibitory properties against ecDHFR, caused by the presence of a 1-substituent, as in the quinoline ring of compound 33 (I 50ecDHFR = 0.75 \u00b5M). This investigation revealed, that the most interesting compounds were 34 and 35 (I 50ecDHFR = 0.75 and 0.77 \u00b5M respectively), where both of them had basic substitutes at the 2-position of the quinoline ring [112] . Activity of these compounds was also highly specific against bacterial DHFR, compare with a vertebrate counterpart. Protonation on the nitrogen N-1 of the quinoline ring is a possible cause of this specificity. Appropriately, substitution at the 4-and 8-position in the quinoline ring could be compared with the 3-and 5substituents of benzylpyrimidines, which probably occupy similar positions in space when bound to DHFR [112] . Compound 36 showed excellent in vitro inhibitory properties (I 50ecDHFR = 0.3 \u00b5M) but presented poor selectivity towards ecDHFR. On the other side, it was noticed, that the diethylamino analog was neither very active nor very selective. Very likely, the decreased activity against bacterial DHFR was due to the bulk of the diethylamino moiety [112] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 81, "end": 86, "text": "[110]", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 560, "end": 565, "text": "[110]", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 1152, "end": 1157, "text": "[110]", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 1528, "end": 1533, "text": "[110]", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 1727, "end": 1732, "text": "[110]", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 1841, "end": 1846, "text": "[110]", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 2187, "end": 2192, "text": "[110]", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 2391, "end": 2396, "text": "[111]", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 2412, "end": 2417, "text": "[112]", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 3030, "end": 3035, "text": "[112]", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 3460, "end": 3465, "text": "[112]", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 3811, "end": 3816, "text": "[112]", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 109, "end": 115, "text": "Fig. 4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2445, "end": 2452, "text": "Fig. 4)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "TMP analogues containing quinoline ring"}, {"text": "The further report suggested that the gem-dimethyl substituents of the dihydroquinoline derivatives were responsible for contributing to potent bacterial DHFR inhibition, as well as the high selectivity.

The term \"designed multiple ligands\" was coined by Morphy and Rankovic to describe the abovementioned compounds [184] . The mode of designed multiple ligands could offer several potential advantages as increase of therapeutic efficacy or decrease development of cancer drug resistance [185, 186] . In another attempt, the quinazoline analogues were synthesized to have closed resemblance with MTX and inhibited the mammalian DHFR in cancerous cells [187] .

This enzyme is actively studied as a target for many new compounds. Following the successful marketing of TMP and cotrimoxazole, intensive research on improved TMP and the search for new DHFR inhibitors was carried out. Search for an improved TMP continued within the Roche group in the 70s and 80s; the nature of desired improvement was, however, not well defined. The focus was on broad-spectrum agents. Activity better than TMP against Gram-negative bacteria was, however, never reached. However, successful discovery of the Hitchings's group about the structural variation of diaminopyrimidines and related structures led to obtaining highly selective and potent agents and many useful drugs, as TMP. Nowadays, TMP seems to be the optimal benchmark for the development of antimicrobials with a broad spectrum of action against Gram-negative bacteria e.g., E. coli, Staphylococci, parasites as P. falciparum, several protozoa as Toxoplasma and fungi e.g., P. carinii. The evaluation of antifolates as inhibitors of the DHRF enzyme has been and still is the subject of work of many scientific teams. Based on the above overview it could be seen, that one of the significant strategies to obtain new potential compounds is combine potency of known drugs e.g., TMP, MTX, or PTX.
