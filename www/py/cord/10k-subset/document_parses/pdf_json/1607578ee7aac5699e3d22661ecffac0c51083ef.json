Patients for whom all three criteria were adverse constituted class 3, patients with none of the adverse criteria constituted class one and patients with one or various association of the adverse criteria formed Class 2. Most patients older than 16 years have disease characteristics that place them in class 3 with very few in class 2. For all the patients with an HLA identical donor we are actually using two Protocols for BMT to whom the patients are assigned on the base of the class they belong to at the time of BMT and independently on the age of the patient. For class 1, class 2 and for class 3 the probabilities of survival and of event-free-survival are respectively of 98% and 94%, 87% and 84%, 100% and 67%.

All the patients were treated in positive-pressure isolation rooms. All the blood products administered after the transplant were irradiated with 30 Gy.

The age at the time of the transplant, the number of transfusions received before the transplant, the ferritin level, the degree of hemosiderosis and the presence of chronic aggressive or chronic persistent hepatitis revealed by liver histopathological examination, the liver iron concentration measured by atomic absorption spectrometry and the size of splenomegaly or the splenectomy did not appear to significantly influence the actuarial probabilities of survival and event-free survival after the transplant. 4 On the basis of these 3 factors patients were stratified in three classes : class 1 with none, class 2 with one or various association of two risk factors and class 3 with all the three risk factors. 1993; Vol. 60.

However, since we started to transplant patients with Homozygous thalassemia is a progressive disease. Although properly chelated, the thalassemic patients show intense liver iron overload progressively increasing with age, and number of red blood cell transfusions received. Recently a cooperative study on 1,087 Italian thalassemic patients 8 reported for those born between 1970 and 1974, 97% probability of being alive 10 years after birth and 94% probability of being alive 15 years after birth. Complications of the disease and of the treatment are diabetes, hepatitis, retardation of pubertal maturation, cardiac disease, that, although less severe in those patients with good compliance with the treatment, are present in 60 to 70% of the children after 15 years of age. These patients are at risk of developing blood born viral infections due to the blood transfusions. If these patients had been transplanted at the time when they were in class 1 or in class 2 they would have had 94 or 84% probabilities of being cured of their genetic defect and become ex-thalassemic after transplant.

Two hundred and eighty were males and 211 females. Age in year ranged from 1 through 32 with an average of 9. One hundred and one had been splenectomized at various time before the transplant. Donors were HLA identical sibling for 475 patients, and HLA identical parents for 16 patients. Three hundred and thirty two donors were heterozygous for beta-thalassemia and 159 were normal. In 281 instances there was ABO compatibility, while in 76 there was a minor and in 134 a major ABO incompatibility.

No. 4 mated by the product -limit method of Kaplan and Meier and Cox Regression Model. 4,s In estimating event free survival, rejection with recurrence of thalassemia and deaths were identified as event. In the first seven patients, cyclophosphamide (CY) 120 mg/kg and total body irradiation (TBI) 8 Gy were usea for preparation to the transplant. The following four patients received busulphan (BU) 10-1.4 mg/kg, CY 200 mg/kg and TBI 4 Gy before the transplant. For all the other following patients the conditioning regimen consisted in the association of Busulfan (BU) and Cyclophosphamide (CY). Busulfan was given orally in four consecutive days at the dose of 16/mg/kg in 37 patients and at the dose of ! 4 mg/kg in 443 patients.
