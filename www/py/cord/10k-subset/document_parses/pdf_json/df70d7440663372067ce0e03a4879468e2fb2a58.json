Therefore, we have developed recombinant CS-specific monoclonal antibodies and their engineered derivatives as soluble antiinflammatory biopharmaceuticals. The principle of anti-CS monoclonal antibody therapy of inflammatory disease has been examined in several preclinical models. Using a monoclonal antibody specific for mouse CS, we have shown that systemic anti-CS monoclonal antibody administration efficiently inhibited complement in vivo (inhibiting serum haemolytic activity for as long as six to seven days after a single intravenous injection), and that treatment with anti-CS monoclonal antibody was therapeutically effective in two distinct models of immune complex nephritis and autoimmune disease (Y. Wang et al., manuscript in preparation). In these models, continuous treatment with anti-CS monoclonal antibody for up to six months was not associated with any negative side effects. In murine collageninduced arthritis, anti-CS monoclonal antibody therapy not only prevented the onset of disease, but, most importantly, was also highly effective in ameliorating the course of established arthritis'\". In an ex vivo model of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)-induced inflammation, administration of a prototype anti-human CS monoclonal antibody completely blocked CSa and CSb-9 generation in whole human blood, as well as both the platelet and leukocyte activation that normally occur during CPB\". Thus, anti-CS monoclonal antibody therapy effectively modulated inflammatory responses in both in vivo and ex vivo models.",

Both recombinant Fab and scFv variants have been derived and shown to bind CS with similar affinity and to block CS activation at the same molar ratio as the intact antibody. In addition, humanized recombinant anti-CS monoclonal antibody and scFv that retain the binding affinity and complement inhibitory activity of their murine counterparts have been produced by CDR grafting (M. Evans, manuscript in preparation). The ability of an scFv derivative of a CS-specific monoclonal antibody to inhibit complement in vivo was tested by generating and administering intravenously a CS-specific scFv cross-reactive with primate complement'\". This scFvinhibited serum complement haemolytic activity for up to 2 hours following administration of a single intravenous bolus, consistent with the more rapid clearance of scFvs relative to intact monoclonal antibodies. CS inhibition by an intravenously administered scFv also demonstrated that the functional domains of the immunoglobulin constant region were not required for complement inhibition in vivo. The efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile of the anti-CS scFv suggest that it may be a useful antiinflammatory agent in acute settings such as CPB or ischaemia/reperfusion injury associated with myocardial infarction.",
