From a clinical pharmacological point of view, intensive care may be seen as a situation where contradictory situations and facts are frequently met: for example, the use of many drug treatments primarily tested under non-intensive care conditions; the lack offormal evaluation of the interplay between pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions which are often utilised side by side and not as components of an integrated management approach; the call for a better defined pharmacokinetic profile of drugs which are given mostly at constant dosage rates while the vital functions and the body compartments of the patient are rapidly changing; and the difficult challenge of defining standard conditions of care against which the specific role of a new intervention can be comparatively tested.",

From a systematic scrutiny of specialty journals in this area, it is easy to verify that while the information is abundant and often detailed for disease states where a single organ or system is impaired, the data on clinical conditions where multiple organ failure is the rule are rather scanty. This is also true with respect to prognostic and descriptive mathematical modelling. Such a finding is not unexpected, because of the obvious difficulties that are inherent in studies where animal models mimicking complex clinical conditions are not readily available (Bortolotti & Bonati 1985) and which would require a close and long term interaction of clinical pharmacologists with intensive care clinicians to produce enough data to represent reliably the reality of intensive care patients or populations.",

The major pathophysiological functions which are affected and their pharmacokinetic implications are summarised in table 1. The rapid changes of clinical status can be associated with variations in the disposition of drugs. In the case of drug protein binding, it is clear that the same variable may be affected differently according to the type of drug (acidic or basic), and the degree of control of the clinical condition in the various stages. Whereas a marked decrease in the serum concentration of albumin occurs, possibly leading to an increase in the free fraction of acidic drugs, the concentration of ai-acid glycoproteins is increased, leading to increased binding of basic drugs (with consequent altered volume of distribution, serum concentrations and pharmacological effects [see Bowdle et al. (1980) for phenytoin, and Liebel et al. (1981) for d-tubocurarine]. However, these changes may be rapidly followed by normalisation of the situation when fluid and protein losses are compensated. Along this line of reasoning, a comprehensive approach has also been proposed for cardiovascular emergencies (see review by .

An opposite view is centred around the role of albumin in sustaining the increase of intravascular colloid osmotic pressure: because permeability increases as a gradual and not generalised process, the interstitial fluid is 'dragged' in and allows re-expansion of the circulating volume, with a consequent lower requirement for water and salt loading, and a reduction of the risk of interstitial oedema (Pontoppidan et al. 1972; Wilson & Sibbald 1976) .",

There is a close relationship between the severity of acute injury (of whatever origin), energy 667 demand and the dynamic balance of protein synthesis and catabolism (nitrogen balance). 2. An uncorrected depletion of amino acids from the muscular, pulmonary and immunological reservoirs is likely to be associated with the development ofimmunodepressed/infective states and therefore with an unfavourable overall clinical course of the critically ill patient. 3. An adequate anabolic response (positive or less negative nitrogen balance) through nutritional support is a prerequisite for a favourable outcome . Table III summarises the experimental and clinical evidence for the role of total parenteral nutrition in assuring a favourable nitrogen balance by minimisation of the loss of proteins which are critical to assure essential physiological functions, and by control of catabolism and stimulation of anabolism. The present state of knowledge about the reciprocal role of calories and nitrogen (Bozzetti 1976; Elwyn et al. 1979; Iapichino et al. 1985; Jeejeebhoy 1977; Shizgal & Forse 1980) can be summarised as follows: a) At every caloric intake, the nitrogen balance improves with nitrogen supplementation b) Conversely, at every nitrogen intake, increased caloric support favours a better nitrogen balance c) Glucose or mixed glucose and lipid sources of calories can be considered equivalent in favouring nitrogen utilisation in depleted patients, at least after an adaptation phase (Bark et al. 1976; Jeejeebhoy 1977; Macfie et al. 1981; Shizgal & Forse 1981) . However, in the acute posttraumatic phase, a mixed glucose and lipid intake is associated with a worse nitrogen balance than is the case with an equivalent glucose intake (Freund et al. 1980; Long et al. 1977a; Shizgal & Forse 1981; Woolf son et al. 1979) . Calorie and nitrogen requirements differ according to both the needs of the individual patient and the target nitrogen balance. For example, in depleted non-catabolic patients, the main therapeutic goal is building of the lean mass (nitrogen balance +2 to +4 g/day): this will require 0.15 to 0.25g nitrogen/kg plus 40 to 60 non-protein kcal/ kg of actual bodyweight. On the other hand, injured patients require primarily control of the major catabolic nitrogen loss: in this situation a double amount of nitrogen (0.27 to 0.29 gjkg) plus 35 to 40 non-protein kcal/kg will favour a zero nitrogen balance (1 IU of insulin added to each 4 to 8g fraction of glucose assures a better anticatabolic effect) [Iapichino et al. 1982; Woolf son et al. 1979 ]. The achievement of a positive nitrogen balance in the acute reaction phase is an unrealistic target (see below). The role of specific aminoacids in injured and septic patients is still being investigated. Branchedchain aminoacids are essential to assure adequate synthesis of proteins in the liver (Blackburn et al. 1979; McMenamy et al. 1981 b) ; their hormone-like action in controlling the rate of muscular catabolism is still controversial (Cerra et al. 1982; Freund et al. 1982; Schmitz et al. 1982 ). On the other hand, a reduced supply of aromatic and sulphurated aminoacids is recommended since their utilisation in the liver is impaired in septic conditions (Clowes et al. 1980a; Freund et al. 1979; Larson et al. 1982; McMenamy et al. 1981 b; Smith et al. 1982 ).",

The higher cardiovascular and respiratory demand may worsen a situation of acute respiratory insufficiency in spontaneously breathing patients with limited ventilatory capacity. Partial replacement of the glycidic load with lipids has been proposed to reduce the surplus production of carbon dioxide which follows the increased respiratory quotient (Askanazi et al. 1981) . The key feature is an increased energy requirement stimulated by the caloric intravenous supply (Askanazi et al. I 980b; Gattinoni et al. 1974) . This concept appears applicable in depleted patients with respiratory insufficiency where the protein-sparing effects of lipids are equivalent to those of carbohydrates; however, it is debatable in injured patients in whom lipids have been shown to have a lower proteinsparing effect when compared with glucose alone. Hence, to achieve the same nitrogen balance, a higher caloric intake will be required when using lipids (Jarnberg et al. 1981) .",

Any type of aminoacids coupled 669 with at least 35 to 40 kcal/kg may be used: unlike the situation in chronic renal insufficiency, urea recirculation is not clinically relevant (Lee 1980) . This approach modifies the classic Giordano total parenteral nutrition schedule for acute renal failure. It must be noted, however, that the few randomised studies which have addressed this issue (Kopple & Feinstein 1983) have not confirmed the superiority of a free nitrogen input (15g nitrogen composed of equal parts of essential and nonessential aminoacids) over the 2 to 3g nitrogen essential aminoacids only regimen, in improving nitrogen balance and survival. No definite criteria can therefore be set for the choice and clinical use of branched-chain amino-or ketoacids to assure optimum catabolic control.",

To reduce the release from muscles of aminoacids the liver cannot metabolise (glucose and insulin are effective); and 2. To re-establish the plasma balance of branchedchain and aromatic aminoacids by infusion of branched-chain aminoacids. In chronic, severe hepatic insufficiency, nutritional therapy can playa more important role. In patients with hepatic encephalopathy, it is currently recommended (Fischer 1981 ) that a 24-to 36-hour infusion of high-dose branched-chain aminoacids be given to waken the patient, followed by supportive nutritional therapy based on glucose and aminoacids (60 to 70 g/day, mainly branchedchain aminoacids to avoid worsening or precipitation of encephalopathy which may occur with aromatic and sulphurated components). The awakening effect of branched-chain aminoacids in this situation is supported by data obtained from ex-perimental models (Higashi et al. 1981; Smith et al. 1978 ) and from uncontrolled clinical trials (Fischer et al. 1974 (Fischer et al. , 1976 ; however, the results from controlled clinical trials are more doubtful (James et al. 1979; Michel et al. 1980; Wahren et al. 1981) . Furthermore, the overall efficacy of the treatment seems to be restricted to an improvement of the general clinical status.

The development of techniques, devices and products which ensure adequate and easily manageable nutritional intake; and 2. A better understanding of the physiological and biochemical mechanisms underlying enteral absorption of the various components of a diet. Given as an oral meal, enteral nutrition is an integration of a free diet which cannot assure more than 80% of the body's caloric and protein needs. Given through a nasogastric tube, it may represent the only source of nutntional support or an effective complement to total parenteral nutrition. This latter combination reduces both the water load of enteral nutrition, and total parenteral nutritionrelated complications, and is specifically useful for oliguric, cardiac, ARDS and head injury patients.",

There is no doubt that low arterial oxygen levels are extremely dangerous in acute situations: 'hypoxia not only stops the machine, it also destroys the machinery.

The provision of a viable gas exchange represents the immediate therapeutic target, but undoubtedly healing of lung lesions and prevention of damaging effects upon other organs remain the ultimate goals and the ones which should always receive maximum attention. ARDS can be taken as the model of a relevant clinical condition where the problems of respiratory care can be discussed. In ARDS lungs, the normal matching of ventilation and perfusion is greatly altered. Under these conditions, the necessary adequate compromise between oxygenation and CO2 clearance may require extremely unphysiological interventions, often demanding high minute volume ventilation (sometimes in excess of 20 L/min), high airways pressures, and high inspired oxygen fractions (Fj0 2). As there is often no specific treatment available for ARDS, management is confined merely to life-supportive intervention (Gattinoni et al. 1983 ).",

On the other hand, respiratory therapy is a mandatory, lifesupporting measure without which ARDS can progress to a full-blown situation. Hence, even when trying to abstain from an Fi0 2 higher than 0.4 to 0.6 and from higher than normal airways pressures (20cm H20 PEEP), we are sometimes left with no other choice than to resort to more dangerous set-tings to ensure viable blood gases. The frustrating exercise of balancing advantages and disadvantages of any specific intervention should always be performed. Unfortunately, little is known about the long term effects of respiratory treatment upon other systems.

However, the points made here have a broader application to cerebral lesions frequently occurring in intensive care settings that are caused by other noxae such as focal vascular injury, acute infections and tumours. The basic processes leading to acute cerebral damage can be described by the scheme shown in figure 2. The hyperaemic swelling and ischaemic focal cerebral oedema cause a high intracranial pressure (fCP). Focal oedema leads to cerebral shift; the displacement of the brain from its axis against the tentorium and the falx leads to cerebral ischaemia and oedema. The resulting diffuse oedema further increases the intracranial pressure and the ischaemic anoxic damage (Bruce et at. 1981; Clifton et al. 1983; Cold & Jensen 1978; Miller 1985; Obrist et at. 1984; Overgaard & Tweed 1983) .",

A hyperadrenergic state is the common feature of these conditions. In patients with acute cerebral damage this may be due to the functional disconnection of the brainstem from the hemispheres or to a direct stimulation of the diencephalic-hypothalamic-brainstem system as a result of high intracranial pressure, ischaemia, blood leaking into the CSF, pH changes in the CSF, etc. (Pia 1974) , as well as extracranial causes. Therapy and prophylaxis of this syndrome rest upon the rather unspecific use of various classes of sedatives and of antiadrenergic drugs. Although their mechanisms of action are different and the treatment schedules are far from well established, all the drugs listed in table V have an unspecific 'sedative' effect, permit good control of the increased muscular tonus and of decerebrate-decorticate fits, and contribute to the reversal of the systemic and cerebral circulatory and metabolic alterations.",

Positive results in other clinical conditions such as peritumoural and encephalitic oedema are hardly transferable to traumatic acute cerebral damage. A cornerstone of the treatment is the control of hyperaemia, a key causal factor in oedema. While there is at present no effective method for influencing the 'luxury flow' locally, antiadrenergic drugs (see table V) can help by reversing the hyperdynamic state (Clifton et al. 1983 ). This treatment requires careful circulatory, respiratory and EEG monitoring but compares favourably in terms of unwanted effects and nursing requirements with other treatments aiming at the same goal, such as barbiturate-induced coma or protracted mechanical ventilation (see below).",

However, their prolonged use is best avoided; osmotic diuretics accumulate in the brain across a damaged blood/brain barrier, reversing the osmotic gradient, with a potential oedema-promoting effect. They also disturb the fluid and electrolyte balance, which must be the real target of prolonged and meticulous control.

            "text": "Mechanical hyperventilation can reduce intracranial pressure in a few seconds by hypocapnic vasoconstriction and, in part, by decreasing cardiac output via positive intrathoracic pressures. Both mechanisms quickly fade, the former because of the restoration of normal cerebral pH, the latter because of compensatory water and salt retention (Heffner & Sahn 1983) . Barbiturate-induced coma has been proven to reduce high intracranial pressure in some patients unresponsive to mechanical hyperventilation, osmotics, corticosteroids and CSF drainage (Marshall et a1. 1979a,b; Rockoff et a1. 1979) . Interestingly, the pharmacokinetic behaviour of the most frequently studied drug, pentobarbitone, has only very recently become the object of specific interest (Bayliff et aI. 1985) . Repeated barbiturate doses are associated both with diagnostic problems and various systemic complications (e.g. hypotension, infections, bedsores). As severe cardiovascular depression is possible, the use of barbiturates calls for simultaneous monitoring of intracranial pressure and blood pressure in order to maintain a safe cerebral perfusion pressure. Since the reduction of intracranial pressure produced by these agents is related to a decrease of the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMR02) and a consequent decrease of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV), no further effect can be expected when metabolism is severely depressed and a 'burst suppression' pattern on the EEG is achieved (Kassell et al. 1980) . Moreover, only the evoked potentials are useful when testing the neurological state in barbiturate-induced coma. When cerebral compliance is critical, bolus doses of sedatives can be of benefit to prevent the increase of intracranial pressure in response to stimulating procedures (Moss et a1. 1983) ; in these cases, EEG monitoring can be useful to predict their effect on intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure (Bingham et a1. 1985) . The persistence of a high intracranial pressure, in the absence of surgically treatable lesions, means that treatment has failed, either due to inadequacy or delay. received much experimental and clinical attention over the last few years, has been associated with good results in focal ischaemic anoxic lesions but not with respect to global cerebral damage (Safar 1980) . The overall rationale of an intervention which assigns beneficial effects to a reduction of the metabolic rate is under revision, as the functional metabolic rate is often already depressed in these patients (Astrup 1982) . Table VIII summarises the goals (and the state of knowledge about the means to achieve them) of this strategy, which can be defined as 'a safe means of increasing the brain's tolerance to the anoxicischaemic insult' (Cohen (981) .",

On the other hand, the two more drugoriented studies (Pottecher et al. 1979; Stevens et al. 1974 ) which failed to provide evidence of a positive role of antibiotics in improving survival and decreasing the spread of infections must be criticised for their poor clinical pharmacological approach, which could have been one of the reasons for their 'negative' results. Surgical drainage and eradication of the focus is obviously the single most important and effective step in the treatment of infection (Meakins et al. 1980; Rapin & George 1983) . Hence, the major challenge for antimicrobial treatment comes from infections such as pneumonia, bacteraemia or meningitis which are not amenable to surgical intervention. The state of the art in this field can be summarised in 6 points, which also provide a possible framework for the urgent, but difficult task of producing reliable data.",

Such confidence is based on an expected ability to describe and predict the pharmacokinetic behaviour of various drugs which are handled in the body by organs whose function is often rapidly changing, and which have to find their way into tissues and organ 'sanctuaries' where the infecting organisms exert their effect and multiply. Standard pharmacokinetic guidelines and monitoring of serum concentrations (and in selected cases, of other tissues or biological fluids) must be applied in cases of organ failure (Bennet et al. 1977) . The expectation is fully justified, but for the time being it still needs confirmation in routine clinical settings. 4. Clinical microbiology may playa more important role than clinical pharmacology. Virtually all micro-organisms have been found to be potential pathogens in the critically ill and any tentative ranking of their importance may be misleading. The clinical condition, the setting, and the problems of bacterial selection, emergence of resistant strains, transfer of resistance and transfer. of resistant strains require comprehensive, attentive surveillance to detect the agent responsible in good time. Clinical microbiology specific to the intensive care situation is faced with apparently insurmountable obstacles, judging from the scant available information. Clinical experience tends to bear out this unsatisfactory state of affairs, because of the objective difficulties in distinguishing harmless colonisation from harmful infection, the incompatibility between the urgency of clinical questions and the time microbiologists need to find relevant answers, and the sophistication required to sample 681 and grow representative and reliable specimenswhich is complicated even further by the presence of mixed infections. 5. Prophylaxis, the classical controversy of antibiotic usage (short of hard specific data for most intensive care conditions), must be based on the principles accepted in other areas of medicine: short term perievent treatment with the narrowest spectrum agents should be the rule. Only experimental data suggest the usefulness of prophylaxis even some hours after contamination (Miller & North 1981) .",

A few general principles are worth emphasising before focusing on specific measures: 1. Complex and multiple interactions are the rule in cardiovascular emergencies arising in the intensive care unit. The rationality of the therapeutic approach depends directly on the degree of accuracy achieved in ranking and correlating the variables to be taken into account. 682 2. Rapid, spontaneous modifications of the haemodynamic status call for particular caution in passing a positive or negative judgement on anyone pharmacological treatment. A conservative attitude is mandatory when no carefully controlled comparative data are available to support the role of new drugs or treatments. 3. An intelligent surveillance strategy may be more useful and informative than active intervention. Intrinsic compensatory circulatory adjustments, though abnormal (e.g. tachycardia in hypovolaemia or hyperthermia) may be satisfactory and in fact better tolerated in certain clinical situations than prompt 'normalisation'. 4. Adequate tissue perfusion (when organ function is threatened) and circulatory stability (when compensatory mechanisms are at risk of breakdown) are the key terms of reference for any intervention strategy. The most common situations requiring prompt ad- justment are those involving imbalance between the circulating volume and the size of the vascular bed, with impending or actual circulatory failure.",

Oral anticoagulants fare better than other treatments (though their benefit has not been proven in terms of mortality reduction, possibly because of the small size of the tested populations), but carry the highest risk of severe haemorrhagic complications.
