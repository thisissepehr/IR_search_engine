This study aims to describe the population being screened for anti-HCV antibodies in the COBATEST Network and identify risk factors associated with a reactive HCV screening test result in the period 2014-2018. Clients aged > 16 screened for HCV in the period 2014-2018 at one of the Network's CBVCT services were included in the study. In the 5 year period, 7426 clients were screened for HCV in 22 centres in 10 countries and anti-HCV antibodies were detected in 113 (1.5%). The majority of people screened were aged 25-44, men who have sex with men (MSM), not HIV+ , not reporting a history of injecting drug use or sex work. Detection of anti-HCV antibodies was associated with being HIV + MSM (aOR 9.1, 95% CI 3.8; 21.8 compared to HIV-clients) and being a person who injects drugs (PWID, aOR 28.1, 95% CI 17.6; 45.0, compared to people with no history of injecting drug use). This study demonstrates that HIV-MSM with no history of injection drug use are using CBVCT services for HCV screening, but reactive screening test is associated with being HIV+ or PWID. The integration of HCV screening into the CBVCT service model may widen access to testing for populations that may otherwise not be tested.",

These figures are likely to be an underestimate as hepatitis infection often shows no symptoms. Only 26.0% of the cases in 2017 included data on the mode of transmission, the most common of which was injecting drug use accounting for 44.0% of those cases with complete information on transmission status [1] . WHO in 2016 recommended a dramatic scale-up of HCV testing and linkage to care to achieve elimination of HCV by 2030 [2] .

Peer counselling offered in community-based voluntary counselling and testing (CBVCT) services can help men who have sex with men (MSM) overcome additional barriers to testing such as homophobia and internalised homonegativity [5] .

Services are heterogenous, variously targeting the general population or mix of key populations; (MSM), people who inject drugs (PWID), migrants or sex workers (SW). Clients enter CBVCT services seeking an anonymous and confidential HIV, hepatitis C or syphilis screening. Not all services offer testing for all diseases. The HCV screening tests detect antibodies to HCV in human serum, plasma or whole blood (giving result: reactive/unreactive). Clients with a reactive specimen then require referral for an RNA test to identify current HCV infection (giving result: active HCV infection/no active HCV infection). RNA testing is not part of the standard offer for CBVCT services but they can report to the COBATEST data collection tool if they have the result of the RNA test performed at another site. The COBATEST Network began in 2013 with the goal of homogenizing the monitoring and evaluation of HIV testing activities at the community level [8, 9] and later expanded to syphilis and HCV screening. The standardised data collection tools collect information on sociodemographic characteristics, reasons for testing, previous HIV/ HCV/syphilis screening testing, risk behaviours, HIV/ HCV/syphilis screening test results, linkage to care. Since 2014 this data has been collected and centralised in a single database. In 2018, 45 organisations in 20 countries in the WHO European region submitted data on their testing activity.",

CBVCT services that did not send the information in 2017 were contacted for this study via email to report their services' characteristics. We refer to each CBVCT service by its number which is randomly assigned when a service joins the COBATEST Network. According to CBVCT service, we report testing setting, target population, which HCV screening tests were offered (rapid oral test, rapid blood test, conventional test) and number of people screened for HCV. Secondly, the clients screened for HCV and clients with a reactive screening test were described by socio-demographic characteristics (gender [men, women, transgender], age group [16-24, 25-44, 45-64, > 65], migrants [defined as been born in a country different to the country where the CBVCT service is placed], region of origin), key populations (MSM, PWID, SW) and epidemiological variables (HIV status, HCV screening test results and RNA test results). Differences between groups were assessed using the Pearson's Chi 2 test with a p value of < 0.05 considered statistically significant.",

Although this sample is not representative of all CBVCT services in Europe or CBVCT services in each country, it may reflect the increasing number of CBVCT services offering HCV screening. The rising number of tests performed in the network comes with a decrease in proportion of reactive HCV tests, reflecting services increasingly offering screening to populations at low risk of HCV. This could have implications for the cost-effectiveness of CBVCT services and requires more investigation to understand how services fund their HCV screening programme and to understand if CBVCT services have the knowledge to identify people at higher risk of HCV.",

            "text": "Services offered by COBATEST members are heterogeneous but the majority of clients being screened for HCV are MSM, as has been seen in previous studies on HIV screening [8] . We found a high proportion of reactive HCV tests in PWID, in line with the lower end of the estimated range from the ECDC (7-95.4%) [11] . The low number of PWID tested reflects the fact that PWID are not the target population for the majority of the CBVCT services in this study. PWID could benefit from improved access to services offering HCV screening which are tailored to their needs. Peer counselling for this group has been suggested as a way to destigmatise testing [12] . In this study, being MSM was not associated with a reactive HCV screening test but being HIV + MSM was. HIV + MSM account for a small fraction of all people tested but show a high proportion of reactive tests, reflecting studies that find the HCV burden in MSM is concentrated in HIV + MSM [13] . The COBATEST questionnaire does not collect enough information to identify other subpopulations of MSM at higher risk of HCV such as preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) users. A study in France in 2016-early 2017 found the incidence of primary HCV in HIV + MSM similar to that of HIV-MSM who use PrEP and recommends both groups should be targeted for HCV screening (Cotte et al. [14] . ECDC public health guidance for HCV testing recommends that MSM, trans people and SW be tested for HCV every 6-12 months depending on ongoing risk (sexualised drug use, PrEP or PEP use, HIV infection, history of rectal bacterial STI), that PWID be tested up to every 6 months and migrants be tested once with re-testing based on individual risk assessment [15] . To assess clients' ongoing risk, from the beginning of 2019 the COBATEST data collection tool will collect information on PrEP use and chemsex.",

            "text": "There are several limitations to this study. The study includes services in 10 countries but the results are not representative of all CBVCT activity in these countries, nor in the European region, and therefore cannot be generalised to the region. We do not have complete information on how centres select who to screen for HCV, and why over 84,000 clients were screened for HIV and not HCV. There was a high proportion of missing data for some variables but, according to the sensitivity analysis, the estimated effect of this was minimal. There are issues with the data quality and documentation at service level which have been identified in a recent study [10] and have not all yet been resolved. CBVCT services offer anonymous and confidential screening services, and no on-site RNA test, thus it is unsurprising that there is a high percentage of missing information on RNA tests. In order to understand if CBVCT services are diagnosing active HCV infections, the reporting of RNA tests and results should be improved. This could be achieved by collaborating with local infectious disease clinics or laboratories to share RNA test results with the consent of the client. Further investigation is needed to understand if CBVCT services have functional linkage to care pathways for clients with a reactive HCV screening test. This study shows that the CBVCT service model can be used to screen for HCV and that services are detecting possible active HCV infection. CBVCT services that historically focussed on HIV testing are now expanding to offer screening for HCV and other diseases. This could boost testing coverage, especially for key populations, which is an essential element of any European country's strategy to eliminate HCV. Countries should incorporate the CBVCT service model as part of a national strategy to increase HCV diagnosis and linkage to care in order to reduce the burden of disease. Governments can support CBVCT services by facilitating circuits that allow fast referral to an RNA test for clients who have had a reactive HCV screening and ensure linkage to care for those with an active infection.",

In the last year of the study (2018) this rose to 18 centres and 3917 tests. The proportion of reactive HCV screening tests was 4.9% in the first year of the study, dropping to 1.2% in the last year.
