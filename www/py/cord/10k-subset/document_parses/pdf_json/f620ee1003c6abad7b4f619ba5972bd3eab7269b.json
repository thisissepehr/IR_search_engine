Design: Retrospective review. Setting: Tertiary paediatric intensive care unit. Patients: Forty-eight cases admitted to our PICU over a 5-year period in whom a diagnosis of tracheobronchial malacia or stenosis was made by dynamic contrast bronchography (1994\u00b11999). Interventions: Conservative management, tracheostomy and longterm ventilation, surgical correction, internal or external airway stenting. Measurements and results: Recording of clinical details, length of invasive ventilation and appearance at contrast bronchography. Five groups of patients were defined: isolated primary airway pathology (n = 7), ex-premature infants (n = 11), vascular rings (n = 9), complex cardiac and/or syndromic pathology (n = 17) and tracheooesophageal fistulae (n = 4). The overall mortality was 29 %. Median length of invasive ventilation in survivors was 38 days and in patients who died 45. Mortality was highest in the patients with complex cardiac and/or syndromic pathology (p = 0.039 Cox regression analysis) but was not related to any other factor. Patients with stenosis required a significantly longer period of ventilatory support (median length of ventilation 59 days) than patients with malacia (39 days). Conclusions: Length of ventilation and bronchographic diagnosis did not predict survival. The only factor found to contribute significantly to mortality was the presence of complex cardiac and/or syndromic pathology. However, patients with stenosis required longer ventilatory support than patients with malacia.",

            "text": "Tracheobronchomalacia is a condition of dynamic airway collapse during expiration. In tracheal stenosis, fixed airway narrowing causes airway obstruction in inspiration and in expiration. These conditions, first described in 1952 [1] , may be primary, when cartilaginous rings are congenitally malformed, or secondary, due to degeneration of previously normal cartilage. In neonatal chronic lung disease, development of the tracheobronchial tree may be abnormal and the cartilage may be weak [2] . Extrinsic airway compression by a vascular ring or by enlarged great vessels in the presence of a large shunt can result in permanent airway narrowing [3] . Tracheo-oesophageal fistulae are often associated with malacia of a portion of the trachea at the point of insertion of the fistula. Airway abnormalities may develop in recurrent aspiration syndromes and in acquired cartilaginous disorders such as relapsing polychondritis. The severity of disease depends on the length, location and degree of narrowing in the affected airway segments.",

The endotracheal tube was maintained in a high position with the tip in the subglottic region. Opacity was obtained by bolus injections of 0.5\u00b12 ml of contrast medium (Omnipaque, Nycomed, Birmingham, UK), injected into the airway via the endotracheal tube through a 3.7 Fr angiography catheter with a single end-hole. Contrast dispersal was obtained by hand ventilation. Up to five affected sites were identified (trachea, left main bronchus, right main bronchus, bronchus intermedius and peripheral bronchi). A pressure monitor was connected to the airway circuit via a Y connector and when collapse was found positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was applied and opening pressures noted. Airways were defined as stenosed when the narrowing was fixed and unaffected by PEEP up to 25 cmH 2 O and malacic when the narrowing was dynamic and improved with positive airway pressure. Infants with tracheal stenosis with distal malacia were classified as tracheal stenosis for the purposes of this analysis since the numbers of patients with both forms of pathology was small (n = 10). Our bronchograms are not stored as cine-films or videos but as static images, so no attempt was made at retrospective blinded severity scoring as this was felt to be unlikely to yield any useful information.",

Contrast bronchography is currently the investigation of choice for ventilated infants in our institution [5] . It enables assessment of the trachea and the more distal bronchi, unlike bronchoscopy, and since it is performed in real time with the infant spontaneously breathing, the airways are assessed throughout the respiratory cycle. It is simple to perform in infants who are already intubated and is also useful in diagnosing fixed airway stenosis. Methods have been suggested for quantitative severity scoring of bronchographic data [17] but, in our experience, clinical assessment of the child is still paramount in determining which infants should be referred for long-term ventilation and/or surgical management. Bronchoscopy is still necessary to identify complete tracheal rings and examination of the airway under direct vision by the surgeon at operation has been more useful than imaging in deciding which surgical approach is most suitable for several patients.",

Moderate airway malacia often requires tracheostomy and long-term home ventilation [18] , which improves pulmonary mechanics and prevents dynamic collapse [19, 20] until the airway grows sufficiently to allow ventilatory support to be withdrawn. However, some infants with severe localised proximal disease benefit from surgical management. Our current strategy is patch tracheoplasty and repair of associated lesions in long segment tracheal stenosis and resection with endto-end repair in short segment tracheal stenosis. Slide tracheoplasties are now rarely performed. Patients developing restenosis or malacia are treated with internal wire mesh Palmaz stents or external Gore-Tex Hagl stents and, if necessary, tracheostomy and long-term ventilation. Mild tracheomalacia, particularly if associated with a tracheo-oesophageal fistula, is treated with aortopexy [21] . Severe short segment tracheomalacia is treated with resection and end-to-end anastomosis and long segment severe tracheomalacia is treated with external Gore-Tex Hagl stents. Patients developing restenosis or malacia are treated with balloon dilatation, internal wire mesh Palmaz stents or tracheostomy and long-term ventilation. The management of these infants is evolving and the use of stents rather than surgery as a primary intervention in malacic airways is likely to increase if their design improves.",

Although most patients died of respiratory causes (Table 3) , included amongst the respiratory deaths in the group with complex cardiac and/or syndromic pathology are two deaths following withdrawal or limitation of care and three due to parenchymal lung disease rather than airway obstruction. Clearly the existence of significant non-airway pathology in these patients may have contributed to their \u00aarespiratory\u00ba deaths. Length of invasive ventilation and bronchographic diagnosis had no impact on outcome. Our data are at odds with the series from Melbourne in which there was a much higher mortality. There are two possible reasons for this. Firstly, our patients might be significantly different from those reported in the previous study. Although there was a similar increased male to female ratio in both our series (29/48 patients male) and in the Melbourne series (38/62 patients male), more patients in the Melbourne study had congenital cardiac disease (41/62 patients) compared to our study (17/48 patients) .
