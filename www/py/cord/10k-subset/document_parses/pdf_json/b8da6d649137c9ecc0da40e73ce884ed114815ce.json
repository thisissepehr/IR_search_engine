Individuals who had amantadine in plasma appeared to be ingesting their doses precisely as recommended. This interpretation is supported bythe observation that the mean steady-state trough amantadine concentration in A2 subjects was almost double that observed in Al recipients, 244 and 146 ng/ml respectively. Moreover, these plasma concentrations were very similar to those expected from the regression oftroughsteady-state plasmaconcentration ondose in similar volunteers ingesting 50 to 300 rug/day.\" The same cannot be inferred in respectof the assiduousness of amantadine ingestion bysubjects in 1980-81, from urine amantadine measurements, eventhough the mean concentration of amantadine in subjects ingesting 200 mg/day was 3 times greater than in those ingesting 100 mg/day, This follows from observations that amantadine elimination through the kidneys is effected by both glomerular filtration and probably tubular secretion\" and is affected by glomerular filtration rates and the pH of urine.\"", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Overall, chemoprophylaxis was potentially protective in 84% of these subjects.

Two new chapters have been added dealing with exercise for special patient populations, patients with hypertension angina, obesity, and principles of behavioral medicine to initate and maintain a healthy life style. The book gives gutdeltnes for the health care provider for evaluation of health status, priorto exercise testingand prescription. Principles of exercise prescription to include prescription for cardiac patients including inpatient programs, outpatients and community exercise programs. This is a useful book for the health care practitionerinvolved with exercise prescription. The authors state that the stimulus to produce this book was the repeated demandsof medical students and houseofficers for a concise practical text listing methods of diagnosis and management of main general surgical conditions. The authors have provided them with a review of twelve major areas of challenge in generalsurgery. Rapid reference is possible byutilizing the Contents at the beginning ofthe book and the briefoutlineat the beginning ofeach subchapter. Although deficiencies can be identified, this outline from a major medical center in England can be a valuable reference source for any student/house officer in surgical training. This book is written for students, technologists, and physicians who wish to learn more about coagulation through evaluation of individual patients with disorders of hemostasis. The book is divided into two parts. In the first part the author reviews in four chapters the biochemistry of blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, the roles of platelets and endothelial cellsin coagulation, and the clinical and laboratoryapproach to bleeding disorders. The second part is comprised of sixty-two case histories that are organized under the categories of hereditary and acquired disorders of coagulation proteinsand physiologic inhibitors, hereditary and acquired disorders of platelets, and complications associated with anticoagulant therapy. The indexprovides a quickgutde to specific examples of each coagulation disorder. Many topics are covered in a somewhat superficial fashion; however numerous texts are available to provide detailed information about specific areas of interest. The book is an excellent gUide for instructors and for those whowish to learn more about a practical approach to disorders of hemostasis.BARBARA M.
