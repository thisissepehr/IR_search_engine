Romanyuk et al. and Chen et al. also reported that women with pneumonia had a higher prevalence of preeclampsia/eclampsia than women without pneumonia [3, 12] . This increased incidence of preeclampsia/eclampsia might be the result of the pathophysiological changes associated with pneumonia. Severe pneumonia is characterized by hypoxemia, which subsequently causes placental hypoxia. The hypoxic placenta releases antiangiogenic and proinflammatory factors that converge upon the maternal endothelium, inducing endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, and organ damage [13] . The three patients complicated with preeclampsia had significantly lower PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratios than those without preeclampsia (mean value: 118 vs 191, p = 0.004), and two of these patients died. Preeclampsia may cause pulmonary edema. Of all obstetric causes of respiratory failure before delivery, severe preeclampsia is the leading cause [14] . A possible explanation for this outcome is that the pulmonary edema caused by severe preeclampsia aggravates the oxygen desaturation caused by pneumonia, predisposing the patient to require a mechanical ventilator. Preeclampsia complicated with pneumonia may be an unfavorable predictive factor for a poor maternal outcome.

When reviewing the clinical data of these 12 patients, we observed that the initial clinical symptoms were similar to those in nonpregnant women, such as fever, cough, malaise, and dyspnea. It is not easy to distinguish between symptoms related to physiological changes and more sinister symptoms of pneumonia during pregnancy. Patient 12 in this case series attended regular antenatal care visits at our hospital; this patient's pneumonia began with the symptoms of a common cold. Three days later, when she developed dyspnea, labor started. Her respiratory symptoms were intermixed with the discomfort of labor pain. This made the early recognition of pneumonia more difficult.

Previous reviews and articles have noted that early delivery is beneficial and potentially life-saving for both mother and fetus [16, 17] . However, earlier on in gestation, the size of the uterus should not affect mechanical ventilation significantly, and the fetus may be nonviable at this younger gestational age. Additionally, the risk of a surgical procedure for a patient in such a critical condition is extremely high. In our case series, pregnancies were continued in 4 patients during 18 to 25 weeks of gestation; the 4 mothers all recovered from pneumonia, but one of them had a spontaneous miscarriage 40 days after the onset of illness. The other 3 pregnancies were uneventful, and live fetuses were discharged from the hospital. Chang et al. and Liao et al. also reported cases of atypical pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation during the second trimester without complications to either the mother or the newborn [18, 19] . However, during the third trimester, since elective delivery causes a 28% reduction in oxygen requirements within 24 h [17] , and since there is a high rate of adverse pregnancy outcomes in maternal pneumonia [3, 20] , most case series in the literature suggest an expeditious delivery after 28 weeks of gestation [1, 6] .
