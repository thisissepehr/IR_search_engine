Until now, clinical studies on characteristics and outcomes in critical patients with HFRS have been limited. The aim of this study was to observe the clinical characteristics and cumulative proportions surviving and explore the predictive effects and risk factors for prognosis. Methods: A detailed retrospective analysis of clinical records for critical HFRS patients was conducted. The patients enrolled were treated in the centre for infectious diseases, Tangdu Hospital, between January 2008 and August 2012. The clinical characteristics between the survivors and non-survivors were compared by Student's t-test or Chi-square test. The risk clinical factors for prognosis were explored by logistic regression analysis. The predictive effects of prognosis in clinical and laboratory parameters were analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.

Generally, the hypotensive phase of HFRS (e.g., low blood pressure and circulation collapse) usually occurs between day 3 and day 7 of the clinical course, and some critical patients even exhibit overlapping hypotensive and oliguric phases combined with various fatal complications. During this period, timely and systematically supportive treatment, including mechanical ventilation combined with continuous blood purification (CBP), vasoactive drugs and nutritional supplement, Abbreviations: r, correlation coefficient; ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome; ARF, acute renal failure; WBC, white blood cells; Scr, serum creatinine; PT, prothrombin time; APTT, activated partial thromboplastin time. are necessary to ensure survival. However, some critical patients still died of refractory shock, ARDS, multiorgan bleeding, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Patients who have passed through the critical phase may manifest obvious oliguria with AKI. The durations of the oliguric phase in patients with HFRS are obviously different based upon the degree of AKI [16] and the influence on applications of RRT including continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) [22, 23] ; only a minority of critical patients die during this phase. Furthermore, it is an unfortunate truth that in addition to the critical condition of the disease on admission, the patient's economic status may also influence the prognosis directly or indirectly. The present study demonstrated that the non-survivors had higher frequencies of dyspnea, agitation, conjunctival hemorrhage, coma, cardiac failure, ARDS and encephalopathy compared to the survivors (Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5). The agitation, conjunctival hemorrhage, coma, cardiac failure, ARDS and encephalopathy were all negatively correlated with the survival outcome (Table 7) . Although there was no significant relationship, the difference was obvious in pleural effusion and pericardial effusion found in the survivors vs. non-survivors (Table 4 ). According to the pathophysiologic characteristics of HFRS, the pleural and pericardial effusion can reflect the degree of body edema and may increase the risk of the occurrence of pulmonary infection, ARDS and heart failure. All of these findings highlight that it would be dangerous to ignore the critical condition of the disease and the increased probability of death when patients exhibit clinical manifestations of ARDS and encephalopathy, and conjunctival hemorrhage can be considered to be a local manifestation of severe organ bleeding with poor outcome. Furthermore, ARDS, conjunctival hemorrhage and coma were identified as risk factors for prognosis by binary logistic regression analysis (Table 8) , which underscores the importance of clinicians' alertness to the occurrence of potentially fatal complications.

According to the pathophysiologic mechanism of HFRS, it has been widely accepted that severe plasma leakage, massive bleeding and/or profound shock may lead to tissue hypoperfusion, potentially rendering AKI and hepatic injury [25] ; the high level of HGB was closely related to the degree of pachyhemia; the low level of PLT was related to the decreased platelet production or increased platelet destruction [26] [27] [28] ; the low level of ALB correlates with degree of the loss of vascular integrity and enhanced vascular permeability, which also usually appears in patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) [3, 29] . Compared to the survivors, the nonsurvivors were found to be more critical, with a higher degree of inflammatory reaction and coagulation abnormality, which is in line with the previous reports on patients with DHF [30] [31] [32] . Furthermore, although the AUCs were not higher than 0.900 and would be influenced by small samples or treatments, ROC analysis still revealed that the WBC levels, PT and APTT times were statistically significant for predicting death (Table 9 , Figure 2 ).

First, this study was conducted at the largest center for infectious diseases in the northwest region of China. Most patients with severe clinical conditions were sent to our medical center, but it is likely that outside of our center, there were still a significant number of critical HFRS patients who were admitted to local hospitals. Therefore, the demographic, epidemiological characteristics and mortality rate in critical patients may have been biased. Second, the clinical manifestations may be biased by clinicians based on his or her personal recognition of the clinical severity. In this study, we were unable to calculate the acute physiology, age, chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) score, sepsis related organ failure assessment (SOFA) and simplified acute physiology score (SAPS II) of the critical patients on admission because of the loss of detailed clinical data on central nervous system dysfunction. These data may be very important for predicting the prognosis. Third, the relatively small number of cases made the statistical power quite small, especially for multivariate logistic regression analysis used for identifying risk factors for death in the critical patients. Finally, the clinical outcomes and classifications of HFRS patients might be biased by the lack of a more standardized protocol for the management of patients with HFRS.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The high fatality in critical patients with HFRS underscores the importance of clinicians' alertness to the occurrence of potentially fatal complications and changes in biochemical status to ensure that timely and systematically supportive treatment can be initiated when necessary.
