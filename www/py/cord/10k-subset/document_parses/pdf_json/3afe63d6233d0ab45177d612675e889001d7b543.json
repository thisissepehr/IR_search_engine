Here, in a first step to study this problem theoretically, we analyze mutating pathogens spreading on simple SiR networks with grid-like connectivity. We have in mind the spatial aspect of epidemics, which often advance on transport links between hosts or groups of hosts such as cities or countries. We focus on the case of mutations that enhance an agent's infection rate. We uncover that the small-world property, i.e., the presence of long-range connections, makes the network very vulnerable, supporting frequent supercritical mutations and bringing the network from disease extinction to full blown epidemic. For very large numbers of long-range links, however, the effect reverses and we find a reduced chance for large outbreaks. We study two cases, one with discrete number of mutational steps and one with a continuous genetic variable, and we analyze various scaling regimes. For the continuous case we derive a Fokker-Planck-like equation for the probability density and solve it for small numbers of shortcuts using the WKB approximation. Our analysis supports the claims that a potentiating mutation in the transmissibility might occur during an epidemic wave and not necessarily before its initiation.",

The mathematical modeling of dynamical processes on networks has, in the recent years, produced an abundance of results that help to unravel the complexities of epidemic waves and predict the outcomes and risks of transmitting diseases 4-7 . Thus, the physical theory of percolation on networks 8 was mapped to the spreading of diseases 9 . This knowledge has been used to determine transmission rates for which a disease becomes endemic 10 by relating the critical infection rate to the threshold of percolation on networks. Moreover, effective immunization strategies to fight the spreading of a disease have been found by identifying individual nodes that should be made immune based on certain network measures 7 .",

Transport networks, which are common substrates for infection spreading, were found to possess the small-world property; particularly those that developed in modern times. For instance, for the spread of human diseases it may be important that individuals fly long distances by plane, which makes the human transport grid to be of small-world type 13 . Similarly, transmission networks of viruses such as the West Nile virus, which are transmitted in short-range by mosquitos and long-range by birds 14 , likely exhibit the small-world property.",

We here built on this earlier modeling work for epidemics on small-world networks. We assume a network of nodes which are inhabited by individuals (hosts of the pathogen). Because of transport of individuals between nodes, infecting agents can travel with them to a connected node and infect the node's community. This process is modeled here by the established Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model in which, for simplicity, individuals at each node are collectively in one of three states: susceptible (S), infected (I), or recovered or removed (R).",

We here investigate the case that pathogens, by a series of random mutations, undergo changes of their genes that affect their infection or transmission probability.

We find that in networks without small-world links, the probability of an escape to the supercritical state remains small, even if the mutation probability is large. In contrast, if small-world links are present, a supercritical mutation occurs frequently even for moderate mutation rate. The genetic change then entails a transition to a supercritical infection probability, which in turn causes a global infection of almost all nodes of the network. In contrast to the former case of epidemics assisted by small-world links, we here obtain a regime with a high chance of complete infestation of the host species due to the escape process driven by mutations. For larger numbers of long-range links, i.e., for networks approaching the global mixing of random graphs, the sweeping outbreaks disappear again.",

If the fitness landscape is flat, all genotypes of a population have the same chance of replication. If however, the landscape exhibits regions of different height, with peaks surrounded by deep valleys, a population usually climbs uphill by series of small genetic changes. In our model we specifically consider the generic case where we have two peaks and one valley in the fitness space, i.e., states between the maxima are selectively disadvantageous (Fig. 1a) . Thus the non-spatial part of our model is similar to point models of stochastic tunneling through a fitness valley 20-22 . In the case of viral epidemics, the two peaks could, for example, correspond to different specified routes of transmission between individual hosts. For instance, in 23 the possibility of an evolution to a respiratory route in mammals has been studied for the potentially dangerous A/H5N1 Influenza virus. Here, as is typical for viruses 24 , the number of genetic substitutions that are required for this virus to adapt is low (at 3 to 5). In contrast, bacteria are adapting to new environments slower, which may be linked to the fact that individual mutations have a smaller effect and many mutations may be required 25 .",

This may appear unrealistic at first; however, it depends indeed on the respective time scales of mutations, fixations and transmissions to determine how close a population is to this scenario. Given the phylogenetic data for instance for the case of Ebola epidemic in 2013-2016, it appears that the genetic variability of the entire virus population of the outbreak is much larger than the variability at each infection site or country 30 . Following this line of thought we consider the limit in which establishment of a strain at each node occurs quickly, so that the local population is collectively characterized by a single virus strain. We will study two scenarios, one for pathogens requiring a small number of mutational steps for adaptation and one for pathogens requiring a large number of steps, where a continuous approximation may be valid: i) In a first case, we introduce a relation \u03bb d (\u03b3) with the mutating genetic variable \u03b3, which can have three values: -1 in the initial state (no mutation), 0 in a neutral state (one mutation), 1 in the supercritical state (two mutations). The transmission probability \u03bb d depends on \u03b3 as This mapping is chosen so that it has two maxima of optimal fitness. One peak is set slightly below the critical infection probability of 0.5 so that the epidemic wave typically covers at most a small finite domain. A second peak is chosen well above the critical infection probability corresponding to a well adapted genotype of the species that may typically lead to a global epidemic wave. In keeping with the valley crossing mentioned above, the intermediate state \u03b3 = 0 presents a minimum in the fitness, with which many of the nodes do not pass on the pathogen. As an initial condition we choose \u03b3 = \u22121.0 at all network nodes and initially infect one randomly chosen node. Then the infection probability is initially below the critical value at \u03bb = 0.45. If a node i is in state I, the sequence variable \u03b3 i mutates in each iteration step with the rates given by the scheme",

As shown in the SI Appendix 1, the total probability s of escaping through the value of \u03b3 = 0 can be obtained by means of a Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation",

Additional numerical analysis shows that the described prevalence of supercritical mutations for larger p does not occur in a grid-like network. SI Appendix, Fig. S1 shows that the probability for supercritical mutations is much smaller for a local network (without short-cuts) even if the mean size of the infected clusters is similarly large as in the small-world case. This suggests that increasing the number of long links in the network helps the mutations by way of (i) increasing the percolation cluster (i.e., lowering the percolation threshold) and (ii) by lifting local blocking of mutated nodes. Thus, we conclude that, besides the increasing percolation cluster, it is the topology of the small-world network that drives the occurrence of mutations and global epidemics in our continuous model.",

The escape to the potentially disastrous supercritical regime is facilitated by a small number of long-range links on the spatial grid of hosts. We are thus closing a loop in which transmission enables mutation and mutation enables the spreading of disease on the complete network.",

In this situation, the non-mutated type indeed covers large parts of the network before the supercritical pathogens can propagate.

For both models, we presented analytical derivations of these relations. The scalings with the small-worldness parameter p, however, are more complex and our discussion in Appendix S2 gives a first hint on the differences of the continuous and discrete cases. For the limit of a continuous mutation space, our simulations suggest that long-range links additionally help to overcome a local blocking to the spreading of pathogens in intermediate genetic states (see Appendix S2 for more details).",

This could be achieved by a suppression of long-range links for instance by shutdown of transport hubs or preferential vaccination of regions around long-range connected nodes. In this way the development of isolated regions of the network, where the mutation can proceed without competition, is diminished. Second, after a supercritical pathogen has established, one needs to prevent spreading by removal of links around the supercritical nucleation site. Third, it is also conceivable, that, depending on the topology, an increase of p can result in the spreading of the non-mutated form, thus preventing the infection by the mutated form. This and other questions regarding, for instance, the influence of vaccinations are subject of current work on the problem.",

For instance, in the case of the Ebola outbreak 2013-2016 it was suggested that one or several mutations identified during the outbreak caused the strong infectivity of the virus 18, 19 . Potentially this question might also determine the chances of a severe mutation of the Ebola virus from a droplet to an airborne transmission route 35 . It has been argued that within-host selectivity provides a much quicker adaptation than between-host selectivity since the time-scale of selectivity is much shorter within a host than between hosts. In the context of our study, the within-host scenario is one of well-mixed dynamics (large p, see Fig. 4a ), where we found a domination of the non-mutated form. Only for intermediate small-worldness do we find the mutated form to be competitive. Our results suggest that the decisive mutation benefits from the small-worldness and may thus arise during the epidemic wave on a network with the suitable properties. This finding substantiates the claims for a mutation during the epidemic 18, 19 .",

The dashed blue line shows the location of the percolation point for a square grid network of nodes. (b) Scheme showing the possible transitions during a time step. Every infected node recovers after a time step (left). A susceptible node that is linked to an infected node becomes infected with probability \u03bb(\u03b3), where \u03b3 is the genetic variable of the infected node. The infected node inherits the value \u03b3 that is then mutated to the new value \u03b3\u2032 in the same time step. (c) A two-dimensional square lattice where a fraction p of regular links has been replaced by long-distance links. Infections (filled circles) can travel to close neighbors but also to distant nodes.
