Finally, we validated our findings in an independent sample of 661 sepsis-induced ARDS cases and 234 at-risk controls. Results: Three candidate genes were prioritized: dynein cytoplasmic-2 heavy chain-1, fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT1), and integrin alpha-1.

In that study, the protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type F-interacting protein alpha-1 (PPFIA1) gene was identified as a novel ARDS locus, which encodes a protein implicated in cell-cell junctions and cell interactions with the extracellular matrix [12] . The authors first identified the most significant association signals in the discovery stage, and then, a replication was performed in independent samples. Finally, these signals were recognized by integration with gene expression data [12] . However, it is anticipated that many other ARDS loci remain to be identified. In the present study, we aimed to reassess the GWAS results published by Christie et al. [12] performing the integration with transcriptomic data from an animal model of ARDS. This approach allowed to prioritize candidate genes that were followed-up in independent replication studies in order to reveal novel sepsis-induced ARDS susceptibility loci. Figure 1 illustrates the overall scheme of the process involved in the selection of candidate genes. Gene prioritization began with transcriptomic data derived from an experimental animal model of ARDS, which was induced by abdominal sepsis after 24 h of cecal ligation and puncture, and subsequent challenge by mechanical ventilation (MV) strategies for 4 h [13] (ArrayExpress accession E-MTAB-2673). Three experimental groups were compared based on the ventilatory approach applied: unventilated spontaneously breathing septic animals (SS), septic animals ventilated with protective MV (SPV), and septic animals ventilated with injurious MV (SIV). Total RNA was purified from total left lung tissue of surviving animals from each experimental group, which was used for hybridization of fragmented cRNA to the GeneChip Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Then, differential gene expression was identified using a multi-group comparison by means of MulCom test, revealing 2859 deregulated genes with a false discovery rate (FDR) \u2264 0.05 and fold change (FC) \u2265 1.7 (Additional file 1: Table S1 ). Differential contribution on biological processes of these genes was assessed by functional annotation clustering analyses using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) v6.7 [14] . This analysis revealed Neuron projection morphogenesis as the key deregulated pathway (FDR = 1.76 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ) (Additional file 2: Table S2 ). Later, in order to reveal other common mechanisms in the animal model, we performed a protein-protein interaction network with the EnrichNet tool using the overlapping deregulated genes from the multi-group comparison (Additional file 3: Table S3 ). While eight signaling interaction networks were significant in at least one of the groups, the signaling by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) network was the only significantly deregulated across all three groups. Signaling by VEGF plays a central and broad role in endothelial cell function, and in several aspects of the immune and inflammatory response, usually linked to lung edema promotion [15] . Moreover, neuron projection morphogenesis shares important characteristics with signaling by VEGF, such as the interplay of similar angiogenic molecules, principles, and mechanisms implicated in the navigation through their targets and morphogens [16] . In fact, VEGF could be considered a prototypic angioneurin, comparable to semaphorins, netrins, slits, ephrins, and neuropilins [17] . Schematic representation of study procedures for gene prioritization for case-control association studies with ARDS susceptibility. Total RNA from left lung tissue from surviving animals of a rodent model of ARDS was used to perform gene expression comparisons among three experimental groups on different mechanical ventilation (MV) strategies. These analyses revealed neuron projection morphogenesis and signaling by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as differentially deregulated pathways, as well as in independent human genomic data. Among the genes contained in both pathways (9 and 44 genes, respectively), only those with at least one significant SNP (p value \u2264 0.01) in the GWAS of ARDS were prioritized: dynein cytoplasmatic 2, heavy chain 1 (DYNC2H1), fms-related tyrosine kinase-1 (FLT1), integrin, alpha-1 (ITGA1), and peroxiredoxin-6 (PRDX6), the latter was excluded for association analyses because the top SNP was monomorphic in the discovery study To validate these results, we then performed a post hoc evaluation from two independent public genomic studies of ARDS. The first was a transcriptomic study in blood cells from septic and sepsis-derived ARDS patients that had received MV for 48 h or less [18] (NCBI accession number GSE10474), which resembled the most experimental conditions from our animal model at that time (Additional file 4: Table S4 ). The second was the only genome-wide association study (GWAS) of ARDS published at the time [12] (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0028268.s003).

Ligands of FLT1, such as VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and placental growth factors are critically involved in edema formation during ARDS [15] . After binding FLT1, they trigger intracellular signaling pathways involved in cellular proliferation, survival, and migration, as well as in the increase of endothelial cell permeability and angiogenesis [37] . Studies carried out in animal models support the implication of this pathway promoting vascular permeability [38] , and functional assays in human vascular cells have shown that elevated expression of FLT1 gene was associated with decreased amounts of inflammatory adhesion molecules [39] . VEGF signaling is required for the maintenance of adult lung alveolar structures and reduced VEGF levels have been found in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from ARDS patients [40] [41] [42] , in contrast with the high VEGF levels found in BAL from healthy individuals [43] . Furthermore, oxidative stress, cytokines, and hypoxia are important factors that regulate VEGF expression [44] , which are key players in ARDS development. Therefore, a positive feedback may exist between all or some of these factors to increase VEGF expression, and consequently, VEGF binding to its receptors may contribute to the promotion of increased vascular permeability and a higher degree of hypoxemia as it has been reported in the earliest stages of ARDS [45] . Common variants in VEGF signaling genes have been consistently associated with susceptibility or outcomes of ARDS patients, and VEGF is one of the most replicated genes associated with ARDS [6] . However, to date, variants from FLT1 have never been associated with ARDS susceptibility or outcomes, although some of them have been found to be associated with other relevant complex traits. In this sense, the FLT1 variant identified in this study was previously associated in two GWAS of large sample sizes and with multi-ethnic patients with coronary arterial disease [46, 47] , where endothelium also plays a key pathophysiological role. Besides, a recent study has shown that two FLT1 variants are associated with a reduced count of red blood cells [48] , and with risk of preeclampsia, perhaps influencing the maternal endothelial dysfunction [48, 49] . Taken together, this information supports the firm role of FLT1 gene variants in complex traits that are mechanistically linked, through the key role of endothelium, to the pathophysiology of the ARDS.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 297, "end": 301, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 508, "end": 512, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 624, "end": 628, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 799, "end": 803, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 986, "end": 990, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 991, "end": 995, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 996, "end": 1000, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1079, "end": 1083, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1192, "end": 1196, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1552, "end": 1556, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1749, "end": 1752, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2127, "end": 2131, "text": "[46,", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 2132, "end": 2135, "text": "47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 2310, "end": 2314, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2405, "end": 2409, "text": "[48,", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2410, "end": 2413, "text": "49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results and discussion"}, {"text": "Our findings reinforce the critical importance of variants in genes from the VEGF pathway in ARDS susceptibility. Despite the fact that the FLT1 SNP rs9513106 is located in an intronic region, the nucleotide change predicts alterations in two transcription regulatory motifs for the members binding to the GATA DNA elements and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) factor families according to Haploreg v4.1. However, no significant eQTL results were found for rs9513106 or any SNP in strong LD in Europeans. In addition, as demonstrated by experiments performed as part of the ENCODE project, rs9513106 is in strong LD with another intronic SNP 9.6 Kb upstream, rs9508025. This SNP is located in a highly conserved region among species, in particular, in an enhancer histone mark and a DNAse I hypersensitivity site in fetal lung cells. Interestingly, rs9508025 was identified as one of the top-hits associated with coronary artery disease risk in a large GWAS study [50] . Nevertheless, future studies are needed to assess the functional effects of these variants in FLT1 expression, protein activity, or its relation with the soluble forms of the protein (i.e., sFLT1) in patient samples. It should be mentioned that increased levels of sFLT1 in plasma have been related with sepsis severity, organ dysfunction, and mortality [51, 52] . Additionally, high sFLT1 levels have also been found in BAL samples of ARDS patients [53] . Therefore, given that sFLT1 acts as a natural competitive inhibitor of VEGF [54] , we postulate that the protective genetic variant found in FLT1 (or a variant in LD with it) could promote the increase of sFLT1 levels and hence, contributing to the protection from lung injury by reducing VEGF activity and the vascular permeability in ARDS patients.

In addition, since no adjustment for population stratification was performed in the discovery sample, the replication in an independent sample with appropriate adjustments suggests minimal confounding effects due to population stratification. However, the top prioritized finding in the published GWAS of ARDS (rs9508026) [12] was not tested due to the fact that this did not allow the design of a genotyping assay so that, an alternative SNP was captured. In addition, although we prioritized the top significant SNP, we only considered one variant per gene for association studies.
