We studied two relatives who died from influenza. We Sanger sequenced GATA2 and evaluated the mutation by gene transfer, measured serum cytokine levels, and analyzed circulating T-and B-cells. Both patients (father and son, P1 and P2) died in 2011 of H1N1pdm IAV infection at the ages of 54 and 31 years, respectively. They had not suffered from severe or moderately severe infections in the last 17 (P1) and 15 years (P2). A daughter of P1 had died at 20 years from infectious complications. Low B-cell, NK-cell, and monocyte numbers and myelodysplastic syndrome led to sequence GATA2. Patients were heterozygous for a novel, hypomorphic, R396L mutation leading to haplo-insufficiency. B-and T-cell rearrangement in peripheral blood from P1 during the influenza episode showed expansion of one major clone. No T-cell receptor excision circles were detected in P1 and P3 since they were 35 and 18 years, respectively. Both patients presented an exuberant, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3-mediated hypercytokinemia during H1N1pdm infection. No data about patients with viremia was available. Two previously reported adult GATA2-deficient patients died from severe H1N1 IAV infection; GATA2 deficiency may predispose to life-threatening influenza in adulthood. However, a role of other genetic variants involved in immune responses cannot be ruled out. Patients with GATA2 deficiency can reach young adulthood without severe infections, including influenza, despite long-lasting complete B-cell and natural killer (NK) cell deficiency, as well as profoundly diminished T-cell thymic output.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Influenza A virus (IAV) infection typically causes a selflimiting disease of the upper respiratory tract [1, 2] .

This mutant protein was expressed normally yet was functionally hypomorphic, underlying haplo-insufficiency in heterozygotes. The severity of the deficiency is illustrated by the death of the three patients from infectious complications, including two deaths from influenza. P1 and P2 presented an exuberant IFN-\u03b3-mediated hypercytokinemia during H1N1pdm infection. Accumulating evidence suggests that hypercytokinemia, particularly of IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, IL-8, CCL2, CXCL9, and/or CXCL10 (an IFN-\u03b3-mediated signature), plays a direct role in ARDS development and in IAV-mediated lung pathology and mortality, and that this effect is independent of viral titers [1, [33] [34] [35] . No data about viremia or inflammatory response in the other GATA2deficient patients with fatal influenza were reported [11, 12] . Plasma levels of Th1 cytokines were also found to be high in GATA2-deficient patients and severe Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) disease with a marked EBV viremia [36] . Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) secondary to an EBV-positive lymphoma [36] severe herpes simplex virus infection [37] and disseminated Mycobacterium kansasii infection (Rodr\u00edguez-Gallego et al. unpublished results) developed in GATA2deficient patients. HLH is a deadly systemic hyperinflammatory condition described as a cytokine storm, particularly of Th1 cytokines [38] . Taken together, our and previous data suggest that, in spite of the profound defects in mononuclear cells, hyperinflammatory responses (particularly Th1-mediated) may develop in GATA2-deficient patients. Abundant tissue-resident macrophages in lung, BM, and healthy skin can be observed in GATA2-deficient patients lacking circulating monocytes [11, 17, 39] . In fact, abundant macrophages had been previously observed in BM biopsies (P1 and P3) and lung biopsies (P3) from our patients. Although alveolar macrophages were found to be, at least partially, dysfunctional, these cells might offer an alternative route of antigen presentation in the absence of DC [17, 39] . Treg deficiency could underlie the exuberant IFN-\u03b3mediated inflammatory response and immunopathology in these patients [40, 41] . Alternatively, a role of genetic variants involved in pathogen sensing and/or inflammatory responses to infection cannot be ruled out [42] . However, in the absence of data about the patient's viremia, we cannot exclude that overwhelming IAV infection is due to the observed deficiencies in mononuclear cells and underlies such an inflammatory response and ARDS in our patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 738, "end": 741, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 742, "end": 746, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 747, "end": 751, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 752, "end": 756, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 878, "end": 882, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 883, "end": 886, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1045, "end": 1049, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1131, "end": 1135, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1174, "end": 1178, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1428, "end": 1432, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1780, "end": 1784, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1785, "end": 1788, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1789, "end": 1792, "text": "39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2096, "end": 2100, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2101, "end": 2104, "text": "39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2226, "end": 2230, "text": "[40,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2231, "end": 2234, "text": "41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2371, "end": 2375, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In spite that P1 lacked peripheral B-cells for at least 11 years, he was able to produce neutralizing antibodies against the novel H1N1pdm IAV strain and a previous annual H1N1 strain. Broadly neutralizing antibodies directed against conserved regions of the hemagglutinin stalk and receptorbinding domain were recently described [43] [44] [45] . Since this patient had not been vaccinated against H1N1pdm, our results suggest that one or a few clones of long-living memory Bcells against a previous IAV expanded in patient P1 and that these cells produced antibodies able to cross-react and to neutralize H1N1pdm. Specific Abs are recognized as the main factor to prevent IAV infection, whereas cell-mediated immunity is thought to be crucial for the control of an established infection [1, 31, 32, 46] . This is the rationale for influenza vaccination. However, patients lacking T-and/or B-cells are not prone to severe influenza, although vaccination is considered not to be effective [9] . In any event, Abs able to neutralize H1N1pdm were unable to fight the ongoing infection in P1. In contrast to B-cells, NK cells, DCs, and monocytes, T-cells are thought to be relatively well-preserved in patients with GATA2 deficiency [27, 30, 39] . Our results suggest that Tcells are more affected in GATA2-deficient patients than previously suspected and, like in other leukocyte subsets, the effect of GATA2 deficiency on T-cells is progressive. P1 did not suffer from severe viral, mycobacterial, or fungal infections despite complete B-cell deficiency for at least 11 years and the absence of thymic output of T-cells for at least 19 years. Overall, our data emphasize that GATA2-deficient patients may live for a long time off one's immunological memories. Our data underscores the role that long-living memory T-and B-cells can play in the resistance to infection in adulthood, particularly in patients with late-onset primary or acquired immunodeficiencies.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 330, "end": 334, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 335, "end": 339, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 340, "end": 344, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 788, "end": 791, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 792, "end": 795, "text": "31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 796, "end": 799, "text": "32,", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 800, "end": 803, "text": "46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 988, "end": 991, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1229, "end": 1233, "text": "[27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1234, "end": 1237, "text": "30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1238, "end": 1241, "text": "39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Several primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDs) predisposing to viral infections were previously reported [47] [48] [49] . However, severe PID affecting T-and B-cells, such as severe combined immunodeficiency or agammaglobulinemia, do not predispose to severe influenza [9] . This contrasts with parainfluenza and other viruses, which often kill children with inborn errors of T-cells [9] . No predisposition to severe influenza was reported in patients with either isolated NK cell deficiencies or DC deficiency [9, [47] [48] [49] [50] . PIDs affecting IFN type I and II have not been reported to have severe influenza [9] . To our best knowledge, IRF7 deficiency and GATA2 deficiency are the only described single-gene inborn errors of immunity associated with lethal IAV infection so far. The only known patient with complete IRF7 deficiency developed lifethreatening influenza at the age of 2.5 years [10] . Her leukocytes, including pDCs, as well as fibroblasts and iPSC-derived pulmonary epithelial cells, produced diminished amounts of type I IFNs. The child is now 7 years old and well with annual vaccination against influenza as her sole prophylaxis, suggesting that IRF7 deficiency might not impair immunity against secondary IAV infection. IRF7 is ubiquitously expressed, and so susceptibility to severe influenza in IRF7 deficiency cannot be ascribed only to a hematopoietic impairment. Patients with AD GATA2 deficiency have a large clinical phenotype including viral infectious disease. Due to the profound impairment in so many leukocyte subpopulations, including loss or diminished pDCs and NK, it is difficult to propose the mechanism underlying susceptibility to severe influenza in GATA2deficient patients. Besides its role in hematopoiesis, GATA2 is expressed in endothelium and lymphatic valves, and it is also involved in adipogenesis [17, 28, 39] . However, the clinical infectious phenotype of GATA2 deficiency is reversed by allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [39] , suggesting that hematopoietic anomalies are by themselves responsible for susceptibility to severe infection. Undoubtedly, the lack of pDCs and NK cells may contribute. However, unlike the IRF7-deficient patient, who survived life-threatening influenza in childhood, our and the two previously reported patients with GATA2 deficiency who died by IAV infection, with no hematologic malignancy at the moment of the IAV infection, died in adulthood [10] [11] [12] . Such deficiencies should be considered in selected patients with life-threatening flu, even in the absence of any personal or familial history. It is not known why some GATA2-deficient patients present with specific complications, particularly severe viral infections, while others (even family members with the same mutation) do not [17, 39] . A role of other genetic variants involved in innate immune responses cannot be ruled out. Our description of two adult relatives with AD GATA2 deficiency who died of flu, with no recent history of other severe infections, suggests that lethal flu may result from and actually reveal single-gene inborn errors of immunity, at least in some patients [51] . Serum cytokine and chemokine levels. Sera from P1 (filled square) and P2 (filled triangle) were obtained 6 and 4 days after admission to the intensive care unit, respectively. Samples from patients with severe acute respiratory failure due to H1N1pdm infection (S-H1N1pdm; N = 6) obtained 5.4 days (range 3-7) after hospital admission and seven healthy controls (HC) are also included. No differences were observed when serum levels of IL-1-\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-12p70, IL-17A, TNF\u03b1, and CCL5 (RANTES) were compared NF were responsible for the clinical evaluation of the patients and also collected and interpreted the data.
