In this work, an optimization method for sensors layout in air ductwork was presented. Three optimal objectives were defined, i.e. the minimum detection time, minimum contaminant exposure, and minimum probability of undetected pollution events. Genetic algorithm (GA) method was used to obtain the non-dominated solutions of multiobjectives optimization problem and the global optimal solution was selected among all of the non-dominated solutions by ordering solutions method. Since the biochemical attack occurred in a ventilation system was a random process, two releasing scenarios were proposed, i.e. the uniform and the air volume-based probability distribution. It was found that such a probability distribution affected the results of optimal sensors layout and also resulted in different detect time and different probability of undetected events. It was discussed how the objective functions are being compatible and competitive with each other, and how sensor quantity affect the optimal results and computational load. The impact of changes on other parameters was given, i.e. the deposition coefficient, the air volume distribution and the manual releasing. This work presents an angle of air ductwork design for indoor environment protection and expects to help in realizing the optimized sensor system design for sudden contaminant releasing within ventilation systems.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Buildings are particularly vulnerable to chemical and biological warfare (CBW) agent contamination since ventilation system and the central air-conditioning serves as a natural carrier for spreading the released contaminant from an artificial source in the ductwork or indoor environment. Such kind of contaminant can spread out to the entire indoor environment within a short period of time (Xue and Zhai 2017; Das et al. 2014; Chen et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2013) . Particular examples of CBW agent contamination include a revelation that terrorists planned to put cyanide into airconditioning system of public buildings across the United States in 2011 (Pearson 2011) and an investigation that the SARS virus spread through ventilation system and resulted more people in disease in 2003 (Kowalski et al. 2003) . Such intentional events have highlighted the potential exposure of indoor occupants to hazardous chemical and biological substances. Bank (2008, 2010) indicated that the most potentially dangerous scenario for a bioterrorism attack on a building involved introducing an aerosolized agent into a building's ventilation system. As in the case of the CBW agents, rapid detection could help isolate the spread of the contaminants before a large number of people were exposed through the ventilation operation (Bastani et al. 2012) . Therefore, early detection and warning of CBW agents released in air ductwork play important roles in protecting the occupants and minimizing the adverse consequences when facing such sudden events. A previous study (Zhou et al. 2015) has considered sensor design for monitoring contaminant dispersion in indoor environments, but it has ignored the agent transportation in ventilation system. Glover (2002) presented an idea that the most efficient points to locate such detection sensors would be the fresh air intake BUILD SIMUL (2018 ) 11: 139-153 https://doi.org/10.1007 List of symbols a ij priority order number obtained by x i and x j comparing for all objectives.

A research group at UC Berkeley (USA) and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) did a plenty of seminal studies on incorporating such sensors into a monitoring system designed to protect building occupants (Sreedharan et al. 2006 (Sreedharan et al. , 2007 Sohn and Lorenzetti 2011) . Sreedharan et al. (2007 Sreedharan et al. ( , 2011 ) explored a Bayesian interpretation approach to characterize an indoor release using threshold sensor data and applied this approach to assess the effects of various sensor characteristics, such as response time and accuracy. Walter et al. (2012) presented a probabilistic approach to design an indoor sensor network for detecting an accidental or intentional chemical or biological release, and demonstrated it by optimizing networks against uncertain release locations, source terms and sensor characteristics. The group's work has greatly developed the monitoring system in buildings to minimize the adverse impact when facing biochemical attacks. However, the calculation model used in their study cannot simulate a sudden pollution occurring in the ventilation system. Due to the effect of convection, contaminant spreads much faster in air ductworks than in rooms. It is of significant importance to devise a monitoring system in air ductwork that can detect, locate, and characterize accidental CBW agents. In this work, an optimization method for sensors layout in the air duct system is presented. It can serve as a supplementary study of the LBNL's work and can provide an optimization approach considering both the rooms and the ventilation systems in buildings.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 392, "end": 411, "text": "(Xue and Zhai 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 412, "end": 428, "text": "Das et al. 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 429, "end": 446, "text": "Chen et al. 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 447, "end": 465, "text": "Zhang et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 656, "end": 670, "text": "(Pearson 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 790, "end": 812, "text": "(Kowalski et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 948, "end": 965, "text": "Bank (2008, 2010)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1320, "end": 1341, "text": "(Bastani et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1560, "end": 1578, "text": "(Zhou et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1737, "end": 1750, "text": "Glover (2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1863, "end": 1880, "text": "BUILD SIMUL (2018", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1881, "end": 1918, "text": ") 11: 139-153 https://doi.org/10.1007", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2161, "end": 2164, "text": "(x)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2258, "end": 2264, "text": "(m, t)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3616, "end": 3639, "text": "(Sreedharan et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3640, "end": 3665, "text": "(Sreedharan et al. , 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 3666, "end": 3691, "text": "Sohn and Lorenzetti 2011)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3694, "end": 3717, "text": "Sreedharan et al.

In their work, they assumed that the agent source was located at the indoor area and each attack scenario had the same probability of occurrence. However, this assumption is not sufficient when the terrorists choose to attack the ventilation system directly, because sensors located at indoor zones cannot detect the agent timely until it spreads into rooms through air outlets.

It is discussed widely in water distribution field. Watson et al. (2009) showed the ability of robust sensor placement for municipal water distribution networks in reducing the amount and magnitude of 9/11-style attacks. Bazargan-Lari (2014) presented a new methodology to identify the best layout of water quality monitoring stations for drinking water distribution systems threatened by deliberate contamination events. In this study, the evidential reasoning (ER) approach was applied to rank the obtained feasible sensor placements and a simulation model (EPANET) was embedded to predict the contaminant transport. In indoor air field, Chen and Wen (2010) utilized a multi-zone modeling approach to design systematic sensor system in buildings. It had been proved that sensor systems designed using data from simpler airflow models could perform as well as those designed using complex CFD model. Arvelo et al. (2002) described the enhancements made to the CONTAM multi-zone model and for determining the optimal placement of CBW sensors in a canonical facility representative of an office building. Liu and Zhai (2009) introduced an adjoint probability method to assist in optimizing high-performance IAQ sensor placement and identifying potential contaminant source locations for a residential dwelling based on limited sensor outputs. More recently, Fontanini et al. (2016) presented a data driven sensor placement algorithm based on dynamical systems approach. In this approach finite dimensional Perron-Frobenius (PF) concept was applied. The PF operator was used to construct an observability gramian that naturally incorporated sensor accuracy, location and sensing constraints. The method presented in their work could determine the response times, sensor coverage maps, and the number of sensors needed for an enclosed environment.

The probabilistic approach based on the multi-zone contaminant transport model was applied to indoor monitoring system design (Sreedharan et al. 2007; Walter et al. 2012) . As far as we know that multi-objective optimization problem has competing constraints and objectives, which can produce numerous non-dominated solutions (Carr et al. 2006) . To obtain the optimal solution from a large number of feasible solutions a robust algorithm is required. The GA method is one such algorithm which can address this issue (Shastri and Diwekar 2006) . Meier and Barkdol (2000) utilized GA to optimize the locations of flow measurement needed for the calibration of the water supply network. Preis and Ostfeld (2008) proposed the use of GA to study a multi-objective model for optimal sensor placement in the water distribution system, but the limitation was that they assumed the contaminant source was known. Walter et.al (2012) doubted that the probability of release points must be considered as part of the sensor network optimization for indoor environment and this type of uncertainty is difficult to consider using GA. However, since the air duct system had more similarities with the water distribution system in both contaminants transport and hydraulic characteristics than indoor environment, we draw on the experience of sensor network design for the water distribution system for which GA method was used as an optimization tool. Whenever sensors are too expensive to deploy widely throughout the whole ventilation system, the GA method may help balance the competing design constraints and the objectives of the sensor network. Developing a sensor system for a specific ventilation system involves the type and number of individual sensors, their placement, the optimization objectives and the methodology of solving multi-objectives problem. This work focused on the optimal sensors layout in the entire ductwork, and took into account three optimized objective functions, i.e., minimum detection time, minimum contaminant exposure and minimum probability of undetected pollution events.

From all the nondominated solutions, the objective function values tend to decrease as the sensor quantity increases in the air duct system.

Figure 16 describes the total contaminant mass entering the chamber on the condition of various particle deposition velocity V d based on the uniform probability distribution in Case 1.
