Most SLEV infections are asymptomatic; when infections are symptomatic, clinical features include fever, lethargy, and confusion (1), with potential complications including sepsis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism, and bronchopneumonia. In hindsight, SLEV infection is consistent with the patient's clinical presentation, with pneumonitis and respiratory decompensation possibly resulting from aspiration during the patient's AMS from viral meningoencephalitis. Deaths from SLEV infection during the first 2 weeks are generally from encephalitis, whereas later deaths are more often caused by complications of hospitalization, such as this patient's bronchopneumonia. Routine diagnosis of SLEV is challenging because serologic testing is only performed by specialized reference laboratories, the period of viremia is brief, and molecular testing by reverse transcription PCR is not widely used. Clinicians in California might fail to consider SLEV when examining a patient with nonspecific febrile illness, especially given the lack of virus or disease activity in the state during 2004-2015. Antibody testing can be complicated by the absence of seroreactivity in elderly and immunocompromised patients, as observed in the case of this patient (Table 1) , as well as potential cross-reactivity with other flavivirus infections, such as dengue, Zika virus, and West Nile virus (3) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1550, "end": 1553, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1418, "end": 1427, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "The identification of SLEV infection in CSF by using a panpathogen metagenomic sequencing assay is another demonstration of the power of an unbiased approach to infectious disease testing (5-7), although challenges remain with respect to test availability, interpretation, and validation (8) .

Nevertheless, we believe he most likely contracted SLEV in California, because his history of travel to Arizona 5 months prior was not consistent with the incubation period of the disease (4-21 days); mosquitoes are less prevalent at the higher altitudes of Payson, Arizona; and the patient's SLEV sequence was most closely related to a strain from a June 2016 Kern County mosquito pool.
