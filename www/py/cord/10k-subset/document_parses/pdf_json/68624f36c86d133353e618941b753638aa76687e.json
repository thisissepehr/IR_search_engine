BALF samples were harvested and used for mNGS as well as microbiological detection. Infectious bacteria or fungi were defined according to relative abundance and number of unique reads. We performed mNGS on 35 BALF samples from 32 patients. The positive rate reached 100% in the mNGS analysis of nine immunocompromised patients. Compared with the culture method, mNGS had a diagnostic sensitivity of 88.89% and a specificity of 74.07% with an agreement rate of 77.78% between these two methods. Compared with the smear method and PCR, mNGS had a diagnostic sensitivity of 77.78% and a specificity of 70.00%. In 13 cases, detection results were positive by mNGS but negative by culture/smear and PCR. The mNGS findings in 11/32 (34.4%) cases led to changes in treatment strategies. Linear regression analysis showed that diversity was significantly correlated with interval between disease onset and sampling.

However, traditional culture methods are time consuming and have low rates of positive detection. With the development of molecular biology, the value of whole genome-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) has gradually been recognized, especially for the detection of rare, atypical, or slow-growing microbes. NGS is mainly used in the clinical setting for assessment of sterile body fluids, including cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and joint effusion [1] [2] [3] . For non-sterile body fluids, such as sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), the applications of NGS are quite limited. In addition to human genome interference and other common problems, the interpretation of NGS results (i.e. distinguishing colonization vs. infection) remains problematic. In recent years, the feasibility of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in the aetiological detection and identification of respiratory tract infections has been demonstrated [4] .
