In a sepsis simulation model, we tested whether the anesthetic ketamine inhibits the macrophage TNF response to antibiotic-exposed CA-MRSA bacteria via its antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. RAW264.7 cells were stimulated for 18 hrs with 10 5 to 10 7 CFU/mL inocula of either of two prototypical CA-MRSA isolates, USA300 strain LAC and USA400 strain MW2, in the presence of either vancomycin or daptomycin. One hour before bacterial stimulation, ketamine was added with or without MK-801 (dizocilpine, a chemically unrelated non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist), APV (D-2-amino-5-phosphono-valerate, a competitive NMDA receptor antagonist), NMDA, or combinations of these agents. Supernatants were collected and assayed for TNF concentration by ELISA.",

The addition of ketamine inhibited macrophage TNF secretion after stimulation with either of the CA-MRSA isolates (LAC, MW2) in the presence of either antibiotic. The NMDA inhibitors, MK-801 and APV, also suppressed macrophage TNF secretion after stimulation with either of the antibiotic-exposed CA-MRSA isolates, and the effect was not additive or synergistic with ketamine. The addition of NMDA substrate augmented TNF secretion in response to the CA-MRSA bacteria, and the addition of APV suppressed the effect of NMDA in a dose-dependent fashion. Conclusions: Ketamine inhibits TNF secretion by MRSA-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages and the mechanism likely involves NMDA receptor antagonism. These findings may have therapeutic significance in MRSA sepsis.",

The prototypical USA400 strain, MW2, (CDC nomenclature for this strain of MRSA) was first isolated in 1999 from a Midwest child with fatal CA-MRSA pneumonia [4] . In 2003, the prototypical USA300 CA-MRSA strain, LAC, was isolated from Los Angeles County patients with skin and soft tissue infections, severe pneumonia and sepsis.

We previously reported that RAW264.7 murine macrophages exposed to any of a series of six pediatric clinical isolates of S. aureus (two CA-MRSA, two HA-MRSA, and two methicillin-susceptible strains) in the presence of daptomycin (vs. vancomycin) secreted less TNF and accumulated less inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein [11] . Vancomycin is a cell-wall active antibiotic that triggers bacterial lysis; it is the antibiotic most commonly used to treat severe MRSA infections in children [12] . Daptomycin is a novel antibiotic that is rapidly bactericidal against staphylococci but does not appear to cause rapid bacterial lysis; the mechanism of its action is not certain but it is reported to trigger depolarization of the bacterial membranes and inhibition of both DNA and RNA synthesis [13, 14] . The rapid lysis of staphylococci, streptococci and other pyogenic bacteria exposed to cell-wall active antibiotics such as beta-lactams and vancomycin results in exaggerated release of bacterial products and an augmented and potentially harmful host inflammatory response [15, 16] . Therefore, optimal treatment of sepsis and other severe bacterial infections might include the use of antibiotics and/or other medications that blunt the host inflammatory response and dampen the cytokine cascade [16] .",

The reasoning for ketamine's use in staphylococcal septic shock is its blood pressure supporting effect. It increases cardiac output and blood pressure, possibly via a catecholamine release mechanism [17, 21] . Some data suggest that ketamine has anti-inflammatory effects [22] [23] [24] [25] . For example, it has been reported that ketamine suppresses macrophage TNF secretion in response to Gram-negative bacterial LPS in vivo and in vitro [22, 23, 25] . There is also one report that ketamine suppresses TNF production by human whole blood in vitro after exposure to staphylococcal enterotoxin B [24] . The mechanisms responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects of ketamine are not known [22] [23] [24] [25] .The present study examined the hypothesis that ketamine could suppress macrophage TNF production in response to whole bacteria, in this case clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Given the important role of TNF in sepsis [26] [27] [28] [29] , and the importance of staphylococcal sepsis in children, such suppression could have a therapeutic impact.",

Macrophage TNF secretion in response to MW2 was 34,535 \u00b1 1,536 pg/ mL in the presence of vancomycin and 15,377 \u00b1 1,267 pg/mL in the presence of daptomycin, a reduction of 55%, significant at p < 0.05. Similarly, macrophage TNF secretion in response to LAC in the presence of vancomycin was 33,345 \u00b1 1,535 pg/mL, and 14,432 \u00b1 1,536 pg/mL in the presence of daptomycin, a reduction of 57%, significant at p < 0.05. We previously reported similar findings in six S. aureus clinical isolates (including two pediatric CA-MRSA isolates of the USA300 group), suggesting that this effect of daptomycin is conserved in many different S. aureus isolates.",

The magnitude of the effect was comparable in response to both MW2 (USA400) and LAC (USA300) bacteria and was similar in the presence of either vancomycin (a lytic antibiotic associated with a greater TNF response to the bacteria) or daptomycin (a non-lytic antibiotic associated with a blunted TNF response to the bacteria). Our data suggest that ketamine administration to macrophages stimulated by CA-MRSA is associated with blunting of the TNF response to these virulent pathogens, and suggest that these findings may have therapeutic significance in MRSA sepsis. Furthermore, these data confirm and extend our previous observations that CA-MRSA bacteria exposed to daptomycin (versus vancomycin) trigger less TNF secretion by macrophages. The potentially beneficial antiinflammatory effects of daptomycin and ketamine were additive (Figures 2, 3) . Bacteria were added at a final concentration of 10 5 to10 7 CFU/mL (retrospective confirmation) in the presence of vancomycin at 20 \u03bcg/mL. One hour prior to stimulation, APV (\"low\" concentration of 300 \u03bcM or \"high\" concentration of 3 mM), ketamine (100 \u03bcM), or NMDA (30 \u03bcM) were added, alone or in combination, as indicated. Cells were then incubated for 18 hours; supernatants were collected and analyzed for TNF content by ELISA. The control lane represents the mean TNF macrophage production by macrophages not stimulated with bacteria. The mean includes wells exposed to APV, ketamine, or NMDA alone or in combination. In the absence of bacteria, TNF secretion was minimal and was not affected by APV, ketamine, or NMDA. Lanes 0-9 depict mean TNF secretion by macrophages exposed to vancomycin-treated MW2 alone (lane 0) or in the presence of the indicated concentrations of APV, ketamine, and/or NMDA (lanes 1-9).

Prompt antibiotic treatment of these and other serious bacterial infections is indicated, but paradoxically has the potential to trigger excessive release of bacterial products and the subsequent augmentation of the host inflammatory response [15, 16] . Macrophages are important sources of many of the proinflammatory cytokines (including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, and TNF) secreted in response to staphylococci and other Gram-positive bacteria [15, 16, 41] .

In this study, we found that this differential effect of daptomycin (versus vancomycin) was also observed when macrophages were stimulated with either of the two prototypical CA-MRSA strains most widely studied today: the USA400 isolate, MW2, and the USA300 isolate, LAC. Importantly, ketamine pre-incubation inhibited macrophage TNF secretion in response to both CA-MRSA strains in the presence of daptomycin as well as in the presence of vancomycin, and the greatest suppression of TNF secretion was noted in the presence of both daptomycin and ketamine.",

APV is a competitive inhibitor of the classical NMDA receptor and acts on the NR2 component of the receptor (30, 33) . We found that MK-801 and APV also inhibited macrophage TNF secretion in response to antibiotictreated MW2 or LAC cells. The magnitude of the inhibition by MK-801 (approximately 30%) and APV (25-35%) was comparable to that observed with ketamine (18-34%), and combinations of MK-801 and ketamine or of APV and ketamine did not exhibit additive or synergistic inhibition of TNF secretion. Furthermore, adding NMDA led to augmented macrophage TNF secretion in response to antibiotic-treated CA-MRSA bacteria, and the NMDA receptor antagonist, APV, blocked this effect. The suppression of TNF induced by ketamine was observed across a range of concentrations and throughout the incubation period.",

To translate the present findings, we are currently working on a clinical model to assess the clinical significance of ketamine's anti-inflammatory effects in patients with bacterial sepsis. Although studies of the effect of ketamine on macrophage responses to purified bacterial components such as Gram-negative lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or Gram-positive lipoteichoic acid (LTA) are instructive [23, 24, 49] , we argue that characterization of the macrophage responses to whole organisms is more likely to provide clinical insights. Indeed, the pioneering experiments of Carswell and Old that identified TNF used whole bacteria as stimuli in macrophage sepsis simulation settings [49] , and we have previously demonstrated that macrophage responses to live, antibiotic-treated staphylococci serve as a powerful model system. Furthermore, the model examines the effect of ketamine only in the presence of antibiotics (either vancomycin or daptomycin). In practice, this is a common clinical scenario. Our data suggest that clinically achievable concentrations of both ketamine and daptomycin could potentially inhibit the excessive macrophage inflammatory response that is observed in patients with severe staphylococcal infections.",

TNF suppression by ketamine was tested after 6, 10, 14, 18 and 24 hours exposure in the presence of vancomycin at 20 \u03bcg/mL and RAW264 macrophage stimulation with either LAC (upper panel) or MW2 (lower panel) CA-MRSA strains.",
