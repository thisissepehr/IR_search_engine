By combining this procedure with sonication, the tigers of sucrose-aceton extracted, infected suckling mouse brains could be increased several hundred times. Good antigens also were obtained from virus grown in B H K 2 t / e 13 cell cultures and concentrated by polyethylene glycol 6000/NAC1. Rubella virus HA antigen and HBsAg were adsorbed to the gel, and excluded from a preparation by treatment with Aerosil. This indicates a limitation to the universal use of the method, presumably related to the particle size.",

The results obtained with Tween-ether extracted rubella virus and with HBsAg (13), when Aerosil actually absorbs the virus specific antigens, points to a limitation to the method, presumably presented by the size of the virion. The exact limit is not known at present, but the data available indicate that the critical diameter is somewhere between 50 and 80 nm. It seems unlikely that the Aerosil absorption method can be applicated to the smaller alpha and flaviviruses.",
