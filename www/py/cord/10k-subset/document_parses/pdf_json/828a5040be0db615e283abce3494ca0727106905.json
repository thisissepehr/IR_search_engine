In the last 10 years it has killed more than 20 million people, mainly small children in Africa. The highly efficacious artemisinine combination therapy is being launched globally, constituting the main hope for fighting the disease. Amodiaquine is a main partner in these combinations. Amodiaquine is almost entirely metabolized by the polymorphic cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoform 2C8 to the pharmacologically active desethylamodiaquine. The question remains whether the efficacy of amodiaquine is affected by the gene polymorphism. Genotype-inferred low metabolizers are found in 1-4% of African populations, which corresponds to millions of expected exposures to the drug. In vivo pharmacokinetic data on amodiaquine is limited. By combining it with published in vitro pharmacodynamic and drug metabolism information, we review and predict the possible relevance, or lack of, of CYP2C8 polymorphisms in the present and future efficacy of amodiaquine.

During the metabolism of hemoglobin the toxic heme is liberated from its molecular scaffold. CQ (and possibly AQ or DEAQ) binds heme, disturbing its inactivation by the parasite [40] . Pfcrt SNPs, in particular a K76T variation, render the parasite resistant to the drug, probably through the efflux of CQ from the organelle. CQ-resistance is reversible in vitro by the action of the calcium blocker verapamil (VP), known to interfere specifically with K76T harboring PfCRT proteins. Interestingly, although DEAQ sensitivity is reversible with VP, AQ response is not significantly affected [41] . This data points for pfcrt K76T to be associated mainly with DEAQ response, partially explaining previously observed in vivo CQ/AQ cross-resistance in vivo, which should maybe be better interpreted as CQ/DEAQ. Furthermore, due to the aforementioned 'tail effect', the slowly eliminated DEAQ is predicted to be the weak link promoting resistance in the AQ-ART combination.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 379, "end": 383, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 791, "end": 795, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pharmacokinetics of amodiaquine"}, {"text": "Can CYP2C8 polymorphisms influence amodiaquine regimens efficacy & safety?", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pharmacokinetics of amodiaquine"}, {"text": "The effect of CYP2C8 polymorphism on DEAQ AUC is dependent on the contribution of this pathway to AQ total clearance.

This suggests that AQ might give a small but non-negligible contribution for the success of the therapy, particularly among a predicted CYP2C8 'low-metabolizer' genotype carrier associated with an increased drug exposure for the parasite. The positive effect of an increased AQ exposure might not be evident in these early days of high efficacy ACT, as observed in a small trial of 20 patients in Papua New Guinea [50] . In this study, all patients were determined as CYP2C8 wild type and were successfully treated, the authors concluding that \"the AQ regimen seems pharmacokinetically adequate in the absence of CYP2C8 polymorphism\" [50] . Nevertheless, with the potential development of P. falciparum resistance to DEAQ, the benefit of a high AQ exposure might increase. This contribution is probably more important through another venue: in vitro experiments have consistently shown that AQ is capable of marked synergism with artemsinine derivatives [51, 52] and, most notably, with its own DEAQ metabolite [43] . Again, the presence of CYP2C8 alleles predisposing for a higher AQ exposure will be expected to prolong the synergistic influence over DEAQ. Results in vitro show that AQ is able to significantly enhance the action of its metabolite towards extraordinary low AQ:DEAQ ratios, beyond 1:100,000. This observation implicates that although AQ serum levels generally drops below the present level of detection (approximately 10 nM) 8 h after administration, very low concentrations -down to the picomolar range -may significantly aid DEAQ antiparasitic action for several days. Again, low-metabolizer patients are potentially associated with an enhanced performance of the AQ chemotherapy, possibly even in areas where DEAQ resistance might be rising, as this synergistic effect seemed to be independent at least of the pfcrt K76T status of the tested parasites [43] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 118, "end": 122, "text": "[27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 123, "end": 126, "text": "42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 127, "end": 130, "text": "43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 248, "end": 252, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 370, "end": 374, "text": "[41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 375, "end": 379, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 380, "end": 384, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 385, "end": 389, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 390, "end": 394, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 395, "end": 399, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 816, "end": 820, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1036, "end": 1040, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1356, "end": 1360, "text": "[51,", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1361, "end": 1364, "text": "52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1413, "end": 1417, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 2276, "end": 2280, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pharmacokinetics of amodiaquine"}, {"text": "In the 1980s, reports documented fatal adverse drug reactions among travelers under AQ-based prophylaxis (incidence 1:2000), mainly through agranulocytosis and hepatic toxicity [53] .
