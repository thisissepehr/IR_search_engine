Ira moderate degree of respiratory impairment is present (hypoxemia or hypercapnea), consideration should be given to intubation for better airway control and possible ventilator management if needed. Following a routine inspection of the tracheobronchiat tree, the suction channel is rinsed with sterile saline, the suction trap changed, and the bronchoscope is wedged into a subsegmentat bronchus of the middle lobe or the tingula in order to optimize fluid and cell return.

The patients should be kept under observation for at least 2 h following the BAL procedure, during which time they should be evaluated for mental status, recovery from medication, and for stability of cardioputmonary status and oxygenation~ COMPLICATIONS BAL is a fairly safe procedure and there are probably few patients in whom the procedure is contraindicated, although this will in part depend on a careful assessment of the benefit to be gained and the precise clinical setting. Relative contraindications to performing BAL that require special precautions be taken include patients who have had a recent meal, patients who are uncooperative or combative, and patients with a recent myocardial infarction or acute respiratory failure. The major complications associated with BAL, such as drug toxicity or hypersensitivity (anaphylaxis), hypoxemia, airway, pleural or parenchymal bleeding, and pneumothorax, are relatively uncommon, and are more often the result of the bronchoscopic and related ancillary procedures such as transbronchial biopsy, rather than the BAL procedure itself (38).",

The incidence of minor side effects increase with increasing amounts of infused and/or retained fluid. The fever that most characteristically occurs 4-6 h after the procedure can be as high as I02~ and associated with shaking chills, usually subsides by 24 h. The transient infiltrates on chest X-ray are rapidly absorbed (within hours), and if the infiltrates are persistent, one should suspect disease progression.",

In most instances, the vol of the BAL fluid return is measured, and the BAL fluid is strained through one or two layers of 4 x 4 gauze to remove insoluble mucus components. The filtered pooled fluid is centrifuged (e.g., 5 rain at 200g) and the supernatant is saved for analysis or frozen at -80~ for subsequent study. The residual pellet of cells is then resuspended in a small known vol (e.g., 1-2 mL Hanks' balanced salt solution). The quantification of total cell count in BAL is most accurate when performed on an aliquot of the unspun filtered sample using a hemocytometer. Further cell differential and other specialized cell analyses can then be completed utilizing either cytocentrifuge (14,t5,4t) or Millipore membrane filtration (15, 42, 43) techniques. It should be recognized that such factors as mucus filtering technique, centrifuge speed, dilution solutions, temperature and rot oflavage solution, cell smear preparation, including use of cytocentrifuge and millipore membranes, staining techniques and methods for reporting cell counts (e.g., including or excluding ciliated/squamous cells) can all affect the differential cell counts (15, (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) .

Others have found that the presence of eosinophils correlates with progressive deterioration of pulmonary function (93, 95 ). An increased number of mast cells has been found in BAL fluids derived from patients with active IPF (12). The fact that AMs in patients with IPF have been found to produce increased levels of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) compared with AMs recovered from normal subjects suggests that cytokinins and/or growth factors may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disorder (96). For example, PDGF stimulates resting cells to enter the cell cycle and divide. High localized levels of PDCF could stimulate mesenchymal cells to proliferate at an inappropriately high rate, thus contributing to the increase in interstitial connective tissue constituents that characterize IPF. The recently confirmed finding that the fibrosis, in chronic pulmonary fibrosis, results mainly from organization of an inflammatory exudate within airspaces (just as it does after acute lung injury), should stimulate considerable ongoing research interest in the further identification and assay technology of BAL fluid \"markers\" of intra-atveolar fibrogenic processes (99a).

Direct staining of cytocentrifuge preparations or concentrated smears may reveal mycobacteria, fungi, toxoplasma, cryptosporidia, and other microorganisms (15). Direct detection of microbial antigens in BAL fluid using monoclonal antibodies (e.g., Cryptococci) or fluorescence assays (e.g., Legionella) is possible. To detect cytomegalovirus (CMV) or herpes infection, direct cytological examination may reveal the characteristic viral inclusions. For more sensitive CMV recovery, direct antigen detection by immunofluorescence or immunochemistry can be used (55). In addition, cultures and DNAprobe analysis are finding increasing application in the detection of virus (56,57). Similar techniques, as well as reverse transcriptase assay and enzyme immunoassays, have been used to detect Human immunodeficiency Virus and its p24 antigen in BAL fluid of AIDS patients (58). Using special precautions to reduce oropharyngeM contamination, quantitative culturing of BAL fluid can be used to differentiate bacterial contamination and colonization from clinically significant lower respiratory tract infections (59-62). BAL fluid cultures from patients with clinically active bacterial pneumonias typically have more than 10 5 colony-forming units per mL of BAL fluid. Gram stain of cytocentrifuged specimens show a high degree of correlation with the BAL fluid cultures. It has been suggested that quantitative BAL fluid cultures will become the method of choice for investigating pulmonary infiltrates compatible with bacterial pneumonia in the immunocompromised host (15). Cancer Detection. FB guided endobronchial biopsy, brushings, needle aspirations, and washings of airway mucosal surfaces are the methods of choice in tung tumor diagnosis.
