She started in a pediatric residency but switched to radiology after 1 year and completed her residency in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1981. She completed a fellowship in pediatric radiology at Winnipeg Children's Hospital, under the mentorship of Martin Reed and Rod McPherson. She enjoyed doing extra angiography during her residency, as well as a rotation in the cardiac Cath Lab at Children's Hospital. This led to a second fellowship in what was called \"pediatric special procedures\" including congenital heart disease, angiography, and neuroradiology at Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School in 1982. She was assigned a research project correlating angiographic findings with John Mulliken's new classification of vascular anomalies.",

This was shortlived because of her immigration status and she took a position at The Hospital for Sick Children's Hospital in Toronto in 1983, as head of cardiac radiology. She performed pediatric cardiac catheterizations and cardiac interventions and developed pediatric cardiac MRI locally. She continued practicing general pediatric radiology and angiography and then became involved in pediatric neuroimaging. While in Toronto, she met Pierre Lasjaunias, a French neuro-interventionalist who was recruited to train the neuroradiologists at the Toronto Western Hospital in neuro-interventional techniques. Lasjaunias agreed to train Pat in Paris and she spent seven months with him in 1985 to 86 where she learnt learned even more about vascular anomalies, neurovascular anatomy and interventional techniques. In this pre-micro catheter era, she modified the adult techniques for the pediatric patients including embolization of arteriovenous fistula using detachable balloons, coils and glue, as well as ethanol and sodium tetradecyl sulfate sclerotherapy for venous and lymphatic malformations. She also had the opportunity to work with Dr. Colapinto and subsequently published the first series of pediatric trans-jugular liver biopsies and the first case report of embolization for pediatric traumatic priapism. She was also the first person to use platinum fiber micro coils in Canada and the first to perform renal artery stenting (with Chet Rees) in a child.",

Three patients had split liver and 11 patients had whole liver transplantation.ceUS was successfully performed in all patients. There were no complications related to the ceUS. In three patients CEUS was performed to evaluate for vascular complications following abnormal Doppler US. In two patients ceUS demonstrated vascular thrombosis confirmed in surgery: In a six month old male post whole liver transplant, initial ceUS in POD 1, confirmed portal vein thrombosis (PVT) seen on Doppler US. Surgery confirmed PVT but also hepatic artery (HA) thrombosis. Marked HA narrowing in the initial ceUS could be seen retrospectively when compared with a post thrombectomy follow-up ceUS. In a one year old female post whole liver transplant, initial ceUS was normal. On POD 3, Doppler showed tardus parvus flow in intrahepatic arteries this followed immediately by ceUS that demonstrated marked HA stenosis. This led to seven hours follow-up ceUS that showed progression to complete HA occlusion confirmed in surgery. In a 16 year-old female, POD 1 ceUS excluded right hepatic vein thrombosis suggested by Doppler and Color US.",

Patients who underwent liver MRI with breath-held and navigator-gated mDixon sequences between January 2017 and July 2018 were included. One reviewer, blinded to sequence, placed free-hand regions of interest, inclusive of as much liver as possible, on four images from each PDFF and R2* parametric map. Another blinded reviewer graded respiratory motion using a 5-point Likert scale. Pearson correlation (r), Lin's concordance coefficients (rc), and Bland-Altman analyses were used to assess agreement between techniques. Frequency of clinically-liming motion (score\u22653) was compared with Fisher's exact test. Results: 42 patients were included (15F:27M; mean age:15.7\u00b14.6 years). Mean PDFF and R2* were 16.6\u00b113.1% and 29.3\u00b14.7 sec -1 on breath-held images vs. 17.0\u00b113.2% and 29.6\u00b15.2 sec -1 on navigator-gated images. PDFF demonstrated almost perfect agreement between sequences (rc=0.997, 95%CI:0.994-0.998; mean bias:0.3%; 95% limits of agreement:-2.4 to +1.7%), while R2* values demonstrated very strong correlation but poor agreement (r=0.837, rc=0.832, 95%CI:0.716-0.910). Navigator-gated images exhibited significantly higher frequency of clinically-limiting respiratory motion (88% vs. 48%, p=0.0001). Conclusions: Despite greater respiratory motion artifact, a freebreathing navigator-gated mDixon sequence produces PDFF values with almost perfect agreement to a breath-held sequence and thus may be an option in patients with limited breathholding capacity. Purpose or Case Report: Applying lower diffusion gradient eliminates signal from all the vessels thereby improving visibility of T2-hyperintense lesions on image with low b-value of 50-100 s/mm2 (LBV). LBV have been shown to be superior to T2-weighted fast spin echo sequence (T2W) in detection of liver lesions in adults. There are no such studies assessing this in children.

Two radiologists reviewed both LBV and T2W sequences independently at different occasions to note number of lesions, smallest lesion size, and location. A consensus reading of the entire MRI examination and correlation with follow-up, other imaging modalities, and pathology in available cases, was used to determine final number of lesions as a reference standard. Inter-observer agreement between 2 sequences for each reader for detection of number of lesions was assessed using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). The average number of lesions per patient detected by both readers on each sequence was compared with each other and with the reference standard using ICC and Signed-Rank test. The smallest lesions detected by each sequence were compared using paired t-test. Results: A total of 170 hyperintense lesions were identified on consensus review to serve as reference standard. The average number of lesions identified by both readers on LBV was 134 (79%) and on T2W were 95 (56%). There was excellent interobserver agreement for detection of lesions on LBV (ICC=0.96 (0.93-0.98)) and T2W (ICC=0.85 (0.75-0.91)), with slightly better agreement on LBV. Both readers identified significantly more lesions on LBV compared to T2W (reader 1 p=0.0036, reader 2 p=0.0001). Compared to the reference standard (mean number of lesions=3.45), T2W detected significantly less lesions (mean number of lesions=1.91; p=0.0000) while there was no significant difference in lesion detection on LBV (mean number of lesions-2.68; p=0.1527). LBV and T2W were not significantly different in identifying the smallest lesion size (reader 1 p=0.50, reader 2 p=0.53). Conclusions: Low b-value DWI images are more sensitive than T2-weighted sequences in detecting hyperintense focal liver lesions in children.

Results: Mean (\u00b1SD) parenchymal volume for our 50 healthy children was 46.0\u00b118.8mL. There was no significant difference in parenchymal volume by sex. There were statistically significant correlations between parenchymal volume and age (r = 0.51, p=0.002), height (r=0.67, p<_0.0001), weight (r=0.75, p<0.0001) and BSA (r=0.75, p<0.0001).

A single observer measured linear thickness of the pancreas in the four previously defined segments (head, neck, body and tail) on axial images from 50 MRI exams prospectively obtained in children (6-16 years old) without pancreatic disease. ROIs were also placed in each the pancreas and spleen (on the same slice, if possible) on T1-weighted gradient recalled echo (GRE) images to measure the T1 ratio. Linear measurements were compared to previously defined norms. T1 ratios were summarized with means and standard deviations and assessed for their relationship to age, sex, height, weight and body surface area (BSA) using t-tests and linear regression, as appropriate. Results: Using previously defined normal values for pediatric pancreatic thickness, 34 healthy participants (68%) had \"atrophy\" of one segment and 14 (28%) had \"atrophy\" of two or more segments.Mean (\u00b1SD) T1 ratio for the study population was 1.33\u00b10.15. There was a statistically significant correlation between T1 ratio and age and height (r=-0.44, p=0.0015 and r=-0.38, p=0.0069, respectively). but not with weight or BSA. There was no significant difference in T1 ratio based on sex. 11 participants (22.4%) had a T1 signal ratio <1.2, a threshold previously determined to correspond with exocrine insufficiency in an adult population. Conclusions: We demonstrate that previously defined normal pancreas thickness values for children are likely too restrictive and that better measures of pancreas bulk in children are needed. Mean T1 ratio in children is related to age and height and is above the normal threshold of 1.2 previously described in adults but >20% of children have T1 ratios below the adult cutoff suggestive of exocrine insufficiency. Specific cut-offs for disease identification by T1 ratio in children are needed.

A single reviewer placed free-hand regions of interest on the T1 parametric maps in the liver, pancreas, and spleen, inclusive of as much parenchyma as possible and on up to four axial images per organ. Student t-tests were used to identify differences in T1 values by gender. Linear regression was performed to assess associations between T1 values and age. Results: 32 patients were included in the study (16F:16M; mean age:12.2\u00b13.1 years; n=16 at 1.5T; n=16 at 3T). Median T1 relaxation times per organ at 1.5T were: 1) liver: 569\u00b139 ms; 2) pancreas: 576\u00b155 ms; and 3) spleen: 1172\u00b171 ms and at 3T were 1) liver: 767\u00b163 ms; 2) pancreas: 730\u00b130 ms; and 3) spleen: 1356\u00b187 ms.

Conclusions: We report normal MRI T1 values for the liver, pancreas, and spleen at 1.5 and 3T in a cohort of healthy children and observed no significant association between age or sex and T1 values. While these values might be used to exclude disease, a larger cohort will likely be needed to establish cut-off values to allow future comparisons with disease states.

MRI-guided interventions are ideal for pediatric patients to eliminate ionizing radiation while providing superior imaging of the nervous and musculoskeletal systems.

Conclusions: There is little information about the evolution of MRI imaging findings following successful sclerotherapy of aneurysmal bone cysts. This study provides a summary of common MRI findings in aneurysmal bone cysts and clinical outcomes for these patients after sclerotherapy. Purpose or Case Report: To confirm technical feasibility and clinical efficacy of osteoid osteoma (OO) cryoablation in a large, pediatric/adolescent cohort with short and long term follow-up. Methods & Materials: An electronic medical record and imaging archive review was performed to identify all cryoablations performed for OOs between 2011 and 2018 at a single tertiary care pediatric hospital. The analysis included 63 patients with suspected OOs treated by cryoablation (age range, 3-18 y; mean age, 11.7 y; 37 boys; 26 girls). Conventional CT guidance was used in 22 procedures; cone-beam CT needle guidance was used in the remaining procedures. Follow-up data were obtained via a standardized telephone questionnaire and clinical notes. Results: Technical success, defined as placement of cryoprobes in the desired location, was achieved in 100% of the 63 patients.Immediate clinical success (cessation of pain and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug [NSAID] use within 1 mo after the procedure) was achieved in 61/63 (96.8%) of patients. There were 2/63 (3.2%) clinical failures, both in small bones of the feet. 5/63 (7.9%) patients had clinical recurrence with repeat ablation and subsequent complete response. Furthermore, longterm clinical success (cessation of pain and NSAID use for > 12 mo after the procedure) was achieved in 54/57 patients (94.7%) at the time of this submission. There were no major complications. Two patients (3.2%) were admitted overnight for pain control after the procedure (minor complications). There were no other minor complications. Conclusions: Image-guided cryoablation is a known technically feasible, clinically efficacious, and safe therapeutic option for children and adolescents with symptomatic OO. Long-term results in this study provide confirmation of a definitive treatment paradigm. Purpose or Case Report: Biopsy is often performed to aid in diagnosis and to clarify optimum management of children with suspected osteomyelitis.

Review parameters included MRI features, technical aspects of the procedure, and clinical data, including details of clinical presentation and microbiology and pathology results. Results: Forty patients (mean age 9.5y, range 0.4-25.8y) underwent biopsy. Fluoroscopy was used in 29 cases. CT guidance was used in 9 and US guidance was used in 2. Additional US guidance for adjacent soft tissue biopsy was used in 15 cases. A 16G bone biopsy cannula was utilized in 34 cases; 13G in 5; and an 11G in 1 case. The mean number of bone cores obtained was 3.6 (range 1-10). There were no procedure-related complications.Biopsy culture yielded a pathogen in 4 of 40 cases, and culture yield did not show significant correlation with fever, leukocytosis/blood culture, ESR/CRP, number of cores, instrument gauge, or acquisition of liquid aspirate or soft tissue. Based on culture and/or pathology results, 23 patients were diagnosed with infectious osteomyelitis (17 acute and 6 chronic). One patient was diagnosed with a stress fracture and one with Hodgkin lymphoma. Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) was diagnosed in 15 patients; CRMO was supported on pathology in 9 cases. Biopsy results, therefore, did not directly inform diagnosis in 6 (15%) patients.On MRI, 74% of lesions were in the appendicular skeleton and 26% in the axial skeleton. An axial location demonstrated a significant association with a positive bacterial culture (p=0.04). There was also a statistically significant association between a lesion size \u226420 mm on MRI and negative bacterial culture (p<0.01). There was no association between culture yield with interosseous/subperiosteal fluid or myositis. Conclusions: Results support bone biopsy as a safe and effective procedure in the management of pediatric osteomyelitis. Although culture yield from bone biopsy was low, overall biopsy results aided in diagnosis in a majority (85%) of patients with suspected osteomyelitis. On MRI, lesion size \u226520 mm and an axial location demonstrated association with positive culture. Purpose or Case Report: Adequate gastric distension via insufflation is a key step in creating a safe percutaneous window during gastrostomy/gastrojejunostomy (G/GJ) placement.

Purpose or Case Report: There has been recent increasing interest in imaging protocol standardization. At our institution, challenges to standardization stem from being a large hospital system with multiple sites and 10 MRI scanners at our facility alone. Scanners are different ages, designed by different manufacturers and vary by type. Posted protocols were not standardized by name and would often not match those within the MRI scanners. Finally, sequence names on MRI scanners varied by manufacturer and type of scanner, and these names would not match posted protocol names. We aim to optimize imaging protocols by standardizing the MRI naming system, making protocols readily available, and continuing to maintain image quality. Our goal is to avoid communication breakdown between technologists, radiologists and referring physicians and to add value by providing consistency.",

The process of updating the online posted protocols was re-evaluated and representative \"thumbnail\" images were associated with each sequence in a protocol to avoid confusion. A soft launch of the new system was implemented with the most frequently used MRI MSK protocol in September 2018. An electronic survey was distributed in October to identify challenges and acceptance by technologists. Results: 22 MRI technologists completed the survey. Of all respondents, 95.5% (n=21) found the new naming convention easier to understand with 81% also adding that it positively affected their workflow (n=18). 57.1% of respondents utilized the new protocol (n=13) since the soft launch the month prior. Of those who utilized it, 100% found the new thumbnail images helpful during the workday (n=13), and 100% also noted that it should be adopted for all protocols (n=13). 90.9% of responding technologists noted they would refer to the posted protocols more often if thumbnail images were included in all protocols (n=20). Individual suggestions for improvement included indicating anatomic coverage on thumbnail photos, including unusual scanning angles, and demonstrating preferred patient positioning. Conclusions: MRI protocol optimization including standardization of protocols, sequences, coverage and a reference article supporting protocol design was well received by technologists and improves their daily workflow. We are also working with ordering clinics, in an effort to divert more patients to unsedated scans.

Each patient consented for the study underwent an additional 6-minute dynamic contrast enhanced MRI scan using the motion-robust high spatiotemporal resolution dynamic radial VIBE sequence (Siemens 3T). The images were reconstructed offline using compressed sensing image reconstruction including regularization in temporal dimension to improve image quality and reduce streaking artifacts due to fast imaging. Images were then automatically post processed using in-house developed software. Post processing steps included segmentation of kidney parenchyma and aorta using a convolutional neural network technique and tracer kinetic model fitting using the Sourbron's two-compartment tracer kinetic model to calculate the magnetic resonance based GFR (MRI-GFR). The MRI-GFR results were compared to the glomerular filtration rate measured by 99mTcDTPA nuclear medicine study (NM-GFR). Results: 18 children (average age 5.9, 8 female:10 male) were enrolled between July 2017-present. The method was technically feasible in all patients. The results showed that the MRI-GFR correlated with NM-GFR with r-square value of 0.94. We also performed Bland Altman analysis (i.e. difference of MRI-GFR and NM-GFR versus mean of NM-GFR and MR-GFR), which showed a reproducibility coefficient (RPC) of 22 with 95% confidence interval, and the coefficient of variation (CV) of 8.2% with values between -21 (-1.96 standard deviation) and 24 (+1.96 standard deviation). Conclusions: MR-GFR is a reliable method of measuring glomerular filtration rate and is comparable to the GFR measured by plasma clearance of 99mTcDTPA. ",

Two-pediatric radiologists reviewed each fMRU, blinded to clinical information and other imaging, to determine the presence, morphology and contrast accumulation in cystic lesions suspected of being CD. Each radiologist made a determination of cyst or CD solely based on the presence of contrast within the lesion. Size and location were also recorded. The timing at which the contrast was first seen within the lesion and the pattern of contrast within the lesion (i.e. complete filling versus layering contrast) were also recorded. The diagnosis of CD was confirmed by either surgery, retrograde pyelogram or acknowledgement of fMRU results in the urologic clinical note. Chi-square was used to examine differences between characteristics of cysts versus diverticula. Inter-reader agreement was also calculated with kappa.

All initial imaging studies were reviewed for the presence and distribution of arterial calcifications, stenosis, and wall thickening/irregularity within the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Available follow up studies were compared to initial imaging findings. A chart review was performed for clinical history. Results: A total of 8 patients (5 boys) from 6 families (2 sets of siblings) were identified. Patients presented prenatally (n=4); or with cardiac failure (n=2), seizures (n=1), or hypertension (n=1). Average follow up was 37 months (range 0 -11 years). A single death occurred at 2 months of age.5 patients underwent imaging at birth and all had arterial calcifications as follows: aorta (n=4), pulmonary (n=3), mesenteric (n=3), renal (n=3), iliac (n=3), subclavian (n=2), brachiocephalic (n=1), common carotid (n=1), coronary (n=1), and splenic (n=1) arteries. 1 patient had main pulmonary artery stenosis and 1 had bilateral renal artery stenosis.4 of the newborn patients underwent follow up imaging between 1 month and 3 years of age. Calcifications were: decreased (n=2), resolved (n=1), or stable (n=1). Stenosis was new or progressed in these 4 patients as follows: renal (n=3), pulmonary (n=2), aorta (n=2), mesenteric (n=2), and iliac (n=1) arteries. Vessel wall irregularity/thickening developed in the pulmonary (n=1), aorta (n=1), mesenteric (n=1) and renal (n=1) arteries. 1 patient in this age group underwent initial imaging and was found to have renal artery stenosis and no calcifications.5 patients over 3 years of age underwent imaging (3 follow up and 2 initial), none of which had calcifications.

Studies with a fixed ID (14 or 16 sec) and a weight-based or fixed IR were included. Timing bolus was utilized in all studies. Age, weight, indication, contrast administration parameters (ID, IR, contrast volume, additional delay from timing bolus peak enhancement), and acquisition parameters (kV, scan time, CTDI volume, and DLP) were recorded. Vascular enhancement was measured as mean attenuation in Hounsfield units (HU) at the aortic root, proximal right and left coronary arteries, distal right coronary artery (RCA), and descending aorta. Optimal enhancement was defined as > 350 HU. The presence and location of artifact from the incoming contrast bolus was noted. Results: 109 CCTAs were performed in 108 patients. Median age was 13.5 years (range 4 -20). Median weight was 51.5 kg (range 20.5 -118). Injection duration was 14 sec in 50% and 16 sec in 50%. Median injection rate for patients <50 kg was 0.1 mL/kg/sec. For patients >50 kg, the injection rate was 5 mL/sec in 58% and 5.5 mL/sec in 35%. Median contrast volume (including the timing bolus) was 1.9 mL/kg (range 1.0 -2.6). No patient had significant bolus artifact in the superior vena cava or right heart obscuring the coronary arteries. In 5%, there was mild or moderate bolus artifact at the level of the right pulmonary artery. Optimal enhancement in the aorta and proximal coronary arteries was achieved in 95% of the patients. Suboptimal enhancement of the distal RCA was seen in 11% of patients with optimal opacification of the proximal coronary arteries. Enhancement was higher in patients scanned at lower kV. Conclusions: Optimal coronary artery opacification can be achieved in pediatric patients utilizing a fixed injection rate and an injection duration protocol of 14 or 16 seconds. The mean contrast dose was 59.3 \u00b1 34.5 mL. Iohexol was the most commonly used contrast medium (98.6%) followed by Iodixanol (1.3%). The mean peak pressure was 68.9 \u00b1 62.3 psi and the flow rate was 1.7 \u00b1 0.9 mL/s. Regarding patients with extravasation, the mean age was 11.2 \u00b1 6.2 years; the most common peripheral IV access site was the antecubital fossa (n = 12). The most common catheter size was 22 gauge (n = 8) and the median catheter dwelling time was between 0 -3 days. The contrast agents used were Iohexol 350 mg/dL (n = 12) and Iohexol 300 mg/dL (n = 6). The PIVIE score observed were seven mild, six moderate and five severe. There is no difference in PIVIE score with respect to flow rate, peak pressure, catheter dwelling time, catheter size, catheter injection site, ultrasound guidance and contrast agent (p > 0.05). Cases with extravasation had significantly higher peak pressure (p < 0.001) and flow rate (p < 0.001) compared to those without extravasation. Patients who received Iohexol 350 had a significantly higher incidence of contrast extravasation compared to those who used Iohexol 300 (p = 0.03).",

            "text": "We identified 39 children with fenestrated or completed Fontan circulation in whom phasecontrast velocity mapping of major thoracic and abdominal vessels was a part of the magnetic resonance (MR). The patients were divided into 3 groups: fenestrated Fontan group with MR under general anesthesia (GA) (15 patients, average age 5.87 years), completed Fontan group with MR under GA (6 patients, average age 8.74 years) and completed Fontan group with MR without GA (18 patients, average age 12.52 years). Patients' flow data were compared with the previously published flow data obtained in heathy control (average age, 13.58 years) at fasting status and after a meal. Results: As compared to healthy controls, Group 1 (fenestrated Fontan) showed normal or marginally increased cardiac output (3.92 \u00b1 0.40 vs 3.72 \u00b1 0.69 L/min/m 2 , p<0.30), while Groups 3 (completed Fontan) showed decreased cardiac output (3.24 \u00b1 0.71 vs 3.96 \u00b1 0.64 L/min/m 2 , p=0.003). Both Group 1 and Group 3 showed reduced abdominal blood flow. Reduced abdominal flow was mainly due to diversion of a large part of cardiac output to aortopulmonary collaterals in Group 1 and reduced cardiac output in Group 3. Superior mesenteric and portal venous flows were more profoundly reduced in Group 3 than in Group 1. On the contrary, the hepatic arterial flow was mildly increased in Group 1 and markedly increased in Group 3. Group 2 showed flow data similar to Group 1 except for the tendency toward decreased cardiac output and superior vena caval flow. Hepatic parenchymal changes were more severe in complete Fontan than in fenestrated Fontan group. There was no significant correlation between the hepatic flow and imaging findings. Conclusions: Fenestrated and completed Fontan circulations showed distinctly different pattern of flow distribution among body parts. Further prospective study in a larger cohort is required to correlate the flow redistribution in Fontan physiology with imaging and laboratory findings as well as the long term outcome. There was a significant decrease in lymphatic malformation volume (p=0.0001), with a mean decrease of 39\u00b125%. Four of 23 patients (17%) saw an apparent increase in lesion size, however the volume increase was relatively small (median 12%). When normalized to body mass index, 20/23 patients (87%) showed a mean 44% reduction in lesion volume. There was no correlation between percent volume decrease and age, sex or dose duration. Lesions demonstrated a change in tissue composition (lower relative fluid content) in 14 patients (64%), while unchanged in 8 patients (36%). Notably, 75% of increasing lesions (3/4) also had a change in tissue composition, whereas patients with volume reduction had a composition change in only 39% (7/18, p<0.005). Conclusions: Sirolimus therapy produced a significant reduction in lesion volume and relative fluid content in a majority of patients, suggesting efficacy in treatment of complex lymphatic malformations. Our results support consideration of sirolimus in the treatment of lymphatic malformations, but additional data that better predict responders, durability of effect, and long-term adverse effects would be beneficial in further characterizing its efficacy.

The vasculature was aligned with chest, neck and thigh regions segmented from CT images of a teenager in Materialise Mimics and 3-Matic. Rubber tube connections inserted between the anatomic regions together with pumps simulate circulatory flow. Vascular access points were created at the neck and thigh region, covered with a replaceable \"skin patch\" for reusability. The vasculature mold and breakaway cavities were 3D printed on a Stratasys Fortus 450mc in ABS plastic. Smooth-On Ecoflex 30 silicone was used for molding simulating body texture and DragonSkin10 used for the skin patches.Three pediatric interventional radiologists and a trainee successfully performed the following procedures under fluoroscopic guidance: renal angiography, cavography, femoral and jugular supra and infra-renal IVC filter placement and retrieval, nontarget coil embolization and snare retrieval, and iliac stent placement. Post simulation, all operators completed a questionnaire, consisting of 13 questions, rating their experience with the phantom using a 5-point Likert scale (1-Strongly disagree, 2-Disagree, 3-Neutral, 4-Agree and 5-Strongly agree). Results: All operators reported that the 3D printed phantom and vasculature were anatomically accurate, and sheath placement, catheter/wire manipulation, supra/infrarenal filter placement and retrieval, and iliac stent placement were realistic. Three operators reported that the aortography and cavography compared favorably to live patients. All operators recommended the 3D printed phantom for basic vascular interventional training for fellows and for training in complex/infrequent pediatric vascular interventions for attendings. Conclusions: To our knowledge this is the first pediatric endovascular multiuse phantom providing capability of simulating complex/uncommon procedures in one model with \"soft tissue\" consistency. The next iteration will involve prospective enrollment of IR trainees and formal assessment of technical skill development with repeatability possible by replacing anatomic phantom segments (stenting). Initial feedback from operators validates the importance of the utility of the 3D printed medical model for training purposes. Results: Nine-patients (mean 13.9 years-old; range 6-19) with massive/submassive PE who underwent PA-CDT were included. PE was diagnosed by CT-angiography and CDT was technically successful in all cases. At cessation of CDT, followup pulmonary-angiography revealed complete thrombus resolution in 4-patients, partial resolution in 5-patients. Mean PA pressures decreased in all patients (mean pre-CDT PA pressure=36.5 mmHg; mean post-CDT PA pressure=28.0 mmHg). CDT alone was clinically successful in 7-patients (78%). One-patient with acute-on-chronic PE with severe pulmonary hypertension required surgical thrombectomy of chronic-thrombus after CDT of acute-thrombus. One-patient died following cessation of CDT for reasons unrelated to CDT procedure. There were no immediate bleeding complications from CDT therapy. All patients who survived were maintained on anticoagulation treatment following CDT. Conclusions: PA-CDT is a technically feasible and relatively safe therapeutic option for children and adolescents with submassive and massive pulmonary emboli. . NT-MTS clinical presentation ranged from lower extremity swelling, pain, and/or venous congestion. All patients underwent pre-and-post stent intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and venography. All T-MTS had stent placement performed at the time of pharmacomechanical rheolysis. Catheter directed thrombolysis with pharmacomechanical rheolysis was performed in all cases of TMTS. All patients were treated with self-expanding stents, ranging from 14-22mm in diameter, and 4-9cm in length. Patients with residual thrombus after pharmacomechanical thrombolysis were placed on our institution's catheter directed thrombolysis protocol using weight-based dosing of tPA; repeat venography and IVUS were performed the following day to evaluate for residual clot burden. Clinical follow up was conducted at 1-6 month time points. Patients with residual or chronic thrombus or persistent/recurrent symptoms received follow-up lower extremity Doppler sonography. All patients with T-MTS were treated with at least 6 months of anticoagulation by the hematology service. All patients with NT-MTS were treated with 6 months of anti-platelet therapy. Results: Technical success was 100%. Clinical success (defined as improvement/elimination of symptoms) = 90%. Overall patency at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months was 100%.

Technical success in split liver vs whole liver was 64% (9/14) and 86% (12/14) in the 28 attempted and successful recanalization procedures respectively. PV Recanalization success was higher at first attempt in the whole liver group (10/12, 83%) in comparison to the split liver group (3/6, 50%).

The procedure time and catheter lifespan between the two techniques were compared using the Mann-Whitney test. The rate of bedside procedure and catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) between the two techniques was calculated. Results: 24 cases (mean age 5 years, range 0-15) of tunneled Cline insertion and 8 (means age 6 years, range 2-18) cases of PICC insertion were performed. The procedure time was significantly shorter in tunneled C-line insertion than PICC insertion (13\u00b15 min Vs. 19\u00b16 min, p=0.030). The catheter lifespan showed no significant difference between tunneled Cline and PICC (12\u00b111 days Vs. 24\u00b121 days, p=0.192). The bedside procedure was performed for poor patient's condition in 88% and 0% of cases of tunneled C-line and PICC, respectively. The rate of CRBSI of tunneled C-line and PICC were 6.7 and 10.6 per 1,000 catheter-days, respectively. Conclusions: Tunneled C-line was associated with shorter procedure time, no significant difference in catheter lifespan and a lower rate of CRBSI compared with PICC. Tunneled C-line can be an alternative to PICC in severely ill young children at the bedside.

            "text": "Our group has programmed a custom algorithm that uses image contrast and neighboring data to estimate the envelope of a spectral Doppler waveform. Our algorithm was implemented in java and uses image-based extraction methods: region of interest reductions, preprocessing, and a novel envelope extraction technique. To test this method against industry standards, we performed a retrospective review on pediatric patients who underwent transcranial Doppler between 1/1/2008 to 7/15/2017 at a single pediatric center on Philips IU-22 machines. Ultrasound images of these waveforms formed three groups: waveforms with manufacturer envelopes, waveforms with technologist drawn envelopes and waveforms without envelopes. The manufacturer and manual envelopes were removed from those images and a human drew the ideal waveform envelope on each waveform. The average absolute pixel difference between the human gold standard and another technique (custom software, manufacturer, and technologist) was the metric of comparison and was also scaled to the region's size. The entire waveform and a single manufacturer determined wave region were compared across techniques. Correlation analysis was also performed on the average pixel error between our algorithm and the manufacturer algorithm for each waveform. Results: 230 patients were included with 3810 unique waveforms. Our approach outperformed the manufacturer or technologist by average pixel error compared to the gold standard (p<.01). For entire waveforms, our algorithm was on average 2 pixels more accurate than the manufacturer; for single waves, our algorithm was on average 2.9 pixels more accurate than the manufacturer and 1 pixel more accurate than the technologist. For entire waveforms unable to be processed by the manufacturer, our algorithm was on average 18 pixels different from the gold standard. Error correlation was low between our approach and manufacturer (r 2 <.32). Artifacts and resizing seemed to have little effect on our technique, with waveform quality impacting measurement more than artifacts or scaling. Conclusions: Our custom algorithm outperforms manufacturer techniques and technologists' manual tracing in determining accurate waveform envelopes for TCD images. This work is a precursor to using these waveforms for input into machine learning algorithms. Conclusions: Type 2 annular fissures are associated with cervical cord ASA infarct in children and are uncommon in children without ASA infarct (2-5%). Disc dessication is somewhat more common in children with ASA infarct but is commonly seen in children without ASA infarct (41-54%). Interestingly, annular fissures associated with ASA infarct typically do not enhance at presentation but may develop enhancement on follow up. Non-enhancing type 2 annular fissures may be acute and are a potential pathway for fibrocartilaginous disc emboli to reach the ASA and cord. Two studies were performed for thoracic outlet syndrome. In multiple cases, findings on MRI with ferumoxytol were confirmed with biopsy and conventional angiogram. None of the patients had an adverse reaction to the ferumoxytol. Conclusions: Ferumoxytol-enhanced MRA is a commonly used contrast agent at our institution to diagnose vascular abnormalities in the brain or whole body. Use of ferumoxytol allows the radiologist to interrogate multiple territories in one study due to its highly stable intravascular time. We were able to confidently detect and characterize vascular abnormalities and exclude vascular malformations. No infusion reactions were noted in our cohort. Therefore, ferumoxytol is a beneficial and safe alternative to gadolinium-based contrast agents for high resolution CNS and whole body MR angiography. 3 minutes) and a highly accelerated Wave-CAIPI SWI sequence (R=9, TA=1.0 minute for the 32-channel head coil; R=6, TA=1.5 minutes for the 20channel head coil).

The accelerated sequence was associated with a subjective increase in central (but not peripheral) image noise. Results: First pass contrast enhanced MRV with subtraction provided the best visualization of cortical and briding veins, even in infants as young as 2-3 months. 3D phase contrast MRV was nearly as good, but image quality was scanner dependent. Sagittal 2D TOF MRV was moderately good at demonstrating cortical and bridging veins near the sagittal sinus, but suffered from in-plane flow saturation and poor spatial resolution in coronal or axial reconstructions. Coronal 2D TOF MRV was the least desireable for briding vein evaluation. Weighted MIP images provided the best (and easiest) overall visualization of the superficial venous system. Thin-slab MIP and volumerendered techniques were useful in selected cases. Conclusions: Selection and optimization of MR venography pulse sequences and post-processing techniques allows for the reliable demonstration of cortical and bridging veins in infants and young children with suspected abusive head trauma. Improved characterization of bridging vein injury may distinguish traumatic from atraumatic SDH and provide valuable insight into the nature and magnitude of head injury. Purpose or Case Report: PHACE syndrome is defined as a large segmental infantile hemangioma (IH) larger than 5 cm, posterior fossa malformations, cerebral arterial anomalies, aortic coarctation, eye anomalies and sternal defect. Cerebrovascular anomalies are estimated at 55% and cardiovascular anomalies at 42%. Cerebral artery anomalies were reported to be on the same side as the facial IH. The objective of our study is to review facial hemangioma and the risk of cerebral or cardiovascular anomalies in PHACE or non-PHACE patients.",

As models are developed for various clinical use cases including bone age assessment, it will be incumbent on radiology practices and health information systems to integrate these models into clinical practice. Conclusions: Our feasibility study on the use of CNN for CAD of tibial fractures has the promise to automate and improve workflow for radiologists. Our partly-trained CNN network using a limited dataset, similar to the numbers a typical radiology trainee will see, was robust and able to multiorthogonally identify fractures and distinguish these fractures from normal physes. This pilot exam on tibial fractures will serve as a basis and foundation for future CNN training for long bone fractures elsewhere in the skeletally immature child. Purpose or Case Report: Radial head and neck fractures represent a small fraction of all pediatric elbow fractures but are often associated with significant long-term morbidity. Various mechanisms can cause these radius fractures; however, the constellation of associated injuries is poorly understood in the pediatric population.

Fracture types and properties were analyzed using ANOVA and independent samples t-tests. Results: 334 radial head and neck fractures were identified (50% female; mean age: 9.6 years, SD 3.9). 37% were noted to have one or more additional fracture about the elbow. Olecranon fractures were most common (23% of all cases), followed by additional medial epicondyle fractures (4%), coronoid fractures (3%), ulnar diaphyseal fractures (3%), and olecranon with medial epicondyle fractures (2%) and others (1-2%). Approximately one-third (33%) of additional fractures were missed by the initial interpreting radiologist. Most (68%) of the missed fractures were visible on the initial radiographs, but 32% were only visible on follow-up radiographs because of Digital tomosynthesis (DT) is an imaging technique that creates multiple radiographs with high in-plane resolution.

DT was performed in thirteen projections/sweeps to determine optimal visualization of fracture fragment displacement. Two pediatric radiologists independently reviewed all projections/sweeps and measured maximal displacement. CT of the 3D-printed models was performed as the gold standard with consensus agreement by the two radiologists on maximal displacement. Estimated radiation dose for pediatric elbow DT was calculated using phantoms. Non-contrast upper extremity CT dose estimates were extracted from dose reports at the authors' institution between July 1, 2015 and June 30, 2018 (N=52). Results: Absorbed dose estimates for DT were 0.15-0.21 mGy, compared to 0.02-0.04 mGy for 2-view elbow radiographs and median CT upper extremity dose 3.9 mGy. Six projections were excluded for poor fracture visualization and inter-reader measurement variation >1 mm. The remaining seven projections had good inter-reader agreement (both readers <1 mm variance from each other, Pearson coefficient 0.93). The lateral transverse and oblique longitudinal DT projections were closest to consensus CT maximal displacement (2.9 and 3.4% measurement variance from CT, respectively). Conclusions: 3D-printed models help to optimize DT technique for ideal visualization of displacement of pediatric medial epicondyle fractures. The lateral transverse and oblique longitudinal DT projections had high inter-reader agreement and high correlation with CT measurement of fracture displacement, at approximately 1/20 th the absorbed radiation dose.

No femur radiographs were obtained. Using the left hand/wrist radiographs, bone ages of these children were estimated by the standards of Greulich and Pyle. Following methodology established in the literature for studying long bone growth, the study cohort was separated into 2 overlapping age groups: childhood (\u226412 years-old) and adolescence (\u226510 yearsold). For those in the childhood cohort, bone length measurements were made between physes along the midline long axis of the bone. For those in the adolescence cohort, bone length measurements were made along the midline long axis of the bone from the upper margins of the proximal to the lower margin of the distal ossified epiphyses. These long bone length measurements (humerus, radius, ulna, tibia, and fibula) and bone age estimates were plotted against patient chronologic ages and compared to published normal reference standards. Results: Eighty-six children (M:F=46:40) with 253 skeletal surveys (M:F=121:132; age range=2 months-22 years) were included. Bone age estimates showed a skeletal maturation pattern that is comparable to normal. However, longitudinal long bone lengths from these children began to significantly deviate from normal by age 1-2. The growth curves of these long bones plateau at around age 10. At adulthood, long bone lengths ranged from 48-61% of normal. Conclusions: Our study establishes reference standards for long bone growth and skeletal maturation of children with Progeria.

Dynamic hip US was performed (transverse flexion and longitudinal flexion views without stress and with stress and during the Ortolani maneuver were obtained; Graf angles measured), except when patient was in a Pavlik harness or brace at which time adynamic hip sonography was performed. When it was determined that alignment was normal without stress, dynamic hip US was added. Size, configuration, and symmetry of the femoral capital epiphyseal ossification centers was assessed when present. All of the studies were performed using Philips IU22 US units (L12-5 and/or L9-3 probes with a few of the earlier images obtained with a C5-2 or 9-4 probe). The US reports included descriptions of the hip morphology (including Graf angles), alignment, and stability. AP supine XR included either a neutral projection or both neutral and frog lateral views. The shape of the acetabulum, alignment of the hips, and the presence, size and symmetry of the femoral capital epiphyses was assessed, and the acetabular angles were measured on neutral views. Alignment was also assessed on frog lateral views. Results: In all 22 patients, there was excellent correlation between the US and XR finding. Conclusions: US may be used as a first line imaging modality in babies >6 months of age presenting with clinical suspicion of DDH as well as those who were diagnosed with DDH prior to 6 months and are due for follow up surveillance, as long as the operator is appropriately experienced and the probe technology allows for visualization of all pertinent landmarks.",

Innovations such as \"last image hold\", pulsed fluoroscopy, and digital fluoroscopy have reduced the patient dose; however, development of new technology to further reduce dose has been largely absent in the last decade. A source of dose during fluoroscopy is \"fluoro hunting\" which is the use of fluoroscopy to center the image over the site of interest.

While at least a portion of the time reduction is likely due to the elimination of \"fluoro hunting\", the reduction was larger than expected. Since the device allows the use of fluoroscopy to be limited to actual diagnostic rather than alignment imaging, it also likely increases the radiologist's awareness of when radiation is being used. Simulated low-dose scans formatted in the axial and coronal planes as 3 mm reconstructions were presented to 3 observers (2 pediatric radiologists, 1 adult abdominal radiologist). The amount of added noise was selected based on prior responses of the individual (adaptive simulation). They marked the location of the appendix, rated the likelihood for appendicitis on a 6-point scale (1-definitely normal to 6-definitely appendicitis). The full-dose study was then presented to the observer, who again marked the appendix, rated the likelihood for appendicitis and the visualization of the appendix. The in situ noise in the appendiceal region was estimated using variance propagation methods. The intraobserver agreement of readers, matching between low dose and full dose, was fit to a parameterized psychometric function (agreement versus noise level) by maximizing the log-likelihood probability. This function can be used to analytically compute a noise shoulder \u039d\u2211, which characterizes a reader's sensitivity to noise. Readers' responses for appendicitis and normal cases were also separately analyzed. Results: At full dose the observers had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.973(0.018, stdev) and selected locations had a mean noise of 9.9 (4.3) HU. Individual readers had a range of noise tolerances (shoulder location), with mean tolerated noise of 23.6 HU (range 18.9-30.3). This equates to an 85% dose reduction. In general, appendicitis cases were less tolerant of noise reduction than normal cases.",

We present representative cases which demonstrate how CNR can be recovered with low-energy virtual mono-energetic (mono-E) images (VMI) following material decomposition of the spectral data. Our measured SSDL doses were comparable or lower than those reported for children imaged using other dual-energy scanners and compared to the ACR national dose index registry for pediatric body CT, would rank in the lower quartiles of reported CTDIvol.

The radiology information system at our institution was queried for the keyword \"intussusception\" in fluoroscopic reports from September 2012 -August 2017. Two authors then reviewed plain films obtained prior to therapeutic enema, when available, for the following findings: normal, paucity of bowel gas, soft tissue mass, meniscus sign, or obstruction. When plain films were not available, the scout image from the therapeutic enema was reviewed. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. The medical record was then reviewed for each patient to determine success of therapeutic enema, and surgical outcome in cases of failed reduction. Complicated surgical cases were defined as those that required more extensive surgery than a standard laparoscopic reduction, such as conversion to open laparotomy. Results: 182 total cases of intussusception reduction were identified and reviewed. A normal bowel gas pattern was seen in 14%, paucity of bowel gas in 65%, soft tissue mass in 26%, meniscus sign in 12%, and obstruction in 10%. Percentages total > 100% due to more than one finding in some patients. A normal bowel gas pattern was associated with the highest therapeutic enema success rate (83%) and lowest rates of complicated surgery (4%) and bowel resection (4%). Conversely, bowel obstruction was associated with the lowest enema success rate (21%), and highest rates of complicated surgery (47%) and bowel resection (42%). Patients with bowel obstruction had a significantly higher likelihood of needing surgical reduction (OR 9.0, 95% CI 2.84-28.47) and bowel resection (OR 11.1, 95% CI 3.66-33.86) than those without obstruction. Paucity of bowel gas, presence of soft tissue mass, and meniscus sign showed enema success rates and surgical outcomes intermediate between normal and obstruction. Conclusions: In most cases of ileocolic intussusception, plain films show an abnormality, with paucity of bowel gas being the most common finding. Plain film findings can provide important prognostic information to both the radiologist and the surgeon, with significantly lower enema reduction rates and higher rates of complicated surgeries in patients with bowel obstruction.

No single modality was diagnostic of PFST in all patients with 75% undergoing multimodality imaging prior to diagnosis. PFST was identified on upper GI study in 6/12 patients.

In addition to the clinical standard 120-seconds per bed position scan, simulated PET images were generated using list mode data to create PET data sets at 30-, 60-, and 90-seconds per bed position. Two readers blinded to time-per-bed position assessed the data evaluating image quality using a 5-point Likert scale (1: extremely poor quality study with major artifacts that is not clinically useful, 2: poor quality study with major artifacts, whose clinical use is not advised, 3: average study with moderate artifacts, probably affecting clinical use, 4: good study with only minor artifacts not affecting clinical use, 5: excellent study without artifacts). SUVmax was calculated on seven regions of interest placed on physiologic structures for each data set. Spearman correlation and relative median and interquartile ranges were calculated. Results: 40 reconstructed data sets from 10 patients were analyzed. Mean Likert scores for the 30-second, 60-second, 90second and 120-second images were 3.7, 4.3, 4.6 and 4.7 for Reader 1 and 4.1, 4.9, 4.8, and 4.9 for Reader 2, respectively. Reader 1 found three 30-seconds per bed position scans below clinical acceptance, Reader 2 found all images clinically acceptable. For the 70 regions of interest per data set, there was near perfect SUVmax correlation with the standard 120-seconds per bed position exam (\u03c1 = .98, .994 and .997 respectively for 30, 60 and 90 seconds per bed position, p<.00001).

Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of performing ultrafast PET/CT in pediatric patients on a digital PET/CT. Reduction in scan times of up to 50% (60 seconds) are attainable without adversely affecting the SUVMax measurements or image interpretability.

The tumor volume also showed a strong similarity with a mean difference of 5.86\u00b143.81 mm 2 with 95%LoA of -80.0 -91.7 mm 2 and an even higher CCC of 0.99. The assessment of tumor presence in the metaphysis and the associated confidence showed perfect agreement for all sequences (1.0, 1.0) of the Fe-and Gd-scans. For the diaphysis, the assessment and confidence, respectively, showed highest agreement for T1-LAVA (0.99, 0.98) and lower agreement for both T2-FSE (0.87, 0.85) and T1-SE (0.87, 0.85). For the epiphysis, the assessment and confidence showed the highest agreement for T2-FSE (0.94, 0.90), slightly lower for T1-LAVA (0.91, 0.85) and the lowest for T1-SE (0.77, 0.73).",

A custom processing pipeline of morphological and perfusion imaging data adapted to neonates was developed to perform automated ROI analysis. Results: Twenty-eight neonates were included in the study between April 2015 and December 2017. There were 16 boys and 12 girls. Statistical analysis was finally performed on 37 MRIs, 17 early MRIs and 20 late MRIs. Eleven neonates had both early and late MRIs of good quality available. Eight out of 17 neonates (47%) had an abnormal early MRI and 7/20 neonates (35%) had an abnormal late MRI. CBF values in the basal ganglia and thalami (BGT) and temporal lobes were significantly higher on DOL3 than on DOL10 (p<0.05). There were no significant differences between DOL3 and DOL10 for the other ROIs. CBF values were significantly higher in the lobe grey matter (GM) vs. the brain and in the BGT vs. the cortical GM, on both DOL3 and DOL10 (p<0.05). On DOL3, the mean CBF was significantly higher in the cortical GM, the BGT, and the frontal and parietal lobes in subjects with an abnormal MRI compared to those with a normal MRI (p<0.05).

Static US images (gray-scale coronal and sagittal views from the anterior fontanelle) from these exams were used to train, validate, and test the CNN. From a total of 1000 images, 800 (n=400 each) served as the training dataset, 100 (n=49 for normal and n=51 for abnormal) as the validation dataset, and 100 (n=51 for normal and n=49 for abnormal) as the test dataset. Performance of the CNN was determined by calculating sensitivity, specificity and accuracy based on the clinical radiology report reference. Area under the receiveroperating curve (AUC) was also obtained. Results: A total of 387 US exams were identified, including 325 normal exams and 62 that were positive for GMH. The mean corrected gestational age at the time of imaging for normal studies was 38 weeks 3 days, compared with 30 weeks 6 days for studies positive for GMH. In the 100 case test set, the overall accuracy of CNN was 72% for GMH detection with an AUC of 0.79. 44/51 normal cases were correctly classified (specificity=86.3%). However, sensitivity was low (57.1%) with a high false negative rate (28/49). Conclusions: Artificial intelligence is currently not able to detect GMH on head ultrasound examinations with acceptable accuracy, primarily due to low sensitivity. This suggests that ultrasound images may be less amenable to CNN training than CT or radiographs due to decreased image contrast, and reaffirms the primary role of human radiologists in head ultrasound interpretation.

Inguinal lymph node access was obtained under ultrasound guidance. CEUS exams were performed concurrently with intranodal inguinal injection of contrast and imaged continuously for 3-5 minutes or until contrast appeared. The TD outlet was classified as patent or not patent by visualization of lymphatic contrast passage into the venous system. Results were correlated with conventional lymphangiography (when available) which was reviewed independently and blinded by a lymphatic interventionalist. Results: 11 patients (9 male) who presented for lymphatic evaluation were identified for the present study. Mean age was 4.4 years (range 2 months to 13.8 years). Of the 11 cases, the TD outlet was patent on CEUS in 10 patients and not patent in one. There was agreement between both CEUS readers on all cases. 9 of 11 patients also had conventional lymphangiography (8 of 9 on the same day, 1 within 6 months of CEUS). Of these 9 cases, the TD outlet was patent in 8 patients and not patent in one on conventional lymphangiography. These patency results matched the CEUS findings for each patient, thereby demonstrating agreement in all 9 cases. Conclusions: CEUS of the neck following intranodal inguinal ultrasound contrast injection can accurately determine TD outlet patency and can thus eliminate the need for conventional lymphangiography when no percutaneous intervention is needed. Though dose was higher for DECT in some larger patients, this may be due to small sample size. Regardless, DECT has several advantages over SECT, which may outweigh a potential small increase in radiation dose on a case by case basis. We suggest that DECT can be introduced into routine practice for pediatric thoracic CTA. ",

Image acquisition was initiated with peak descending aortic enhancement (425 HU). Qblique coronal 1.3-1.5 mm thick maximum intensity projections were reconstructed from the phase where the AoA was identified as a hairpin curved vessel in the anterior midsagittal surface of the spine. The AoA was considered visualized if the \"hairpin loop\" of the artery within the spinal canal was visible in addition to the anterior spinal artery and the vessel could be traced to the intercostal artery by paging through oblique coronal reformats. The vertebral body above the level at which the spinal branch of the segmental artery entered the spinal canal and continued as the AoA was considered the level of AoA origin. The study radiologist blinded to the official report reviewed all scans. Results: Dynamic 4D airway CTs in 79 patients (43 male, 5 months-18 years) who underwent preoperative imaging for airway anomalies were evaluated. Continuity between AoA and aorta through intercostal or lumbar artery was confirmed in 67 (84%) patients. Level of origin of AoA was most frequent at T10 and T11 (19 and 24 patients, respectively) but was also found as high as C7. AoA was most commonly seen on 3 rd acquisition (56%). Of 12 patients in whom all the criteria for AoA were not fulfilled, the anterior spinal artery was visualized in the lower spinal canal in 5 patients. Conclusions: AoA can be identified in pediatric patients on dynamic 4D airway studies with greater craniocaudal coverage, optimal timing of scan acquisition and tailored multiphase data processing.

With CTA, PAVM was evaluated based on location, distribution, and size. Each PAVM was scored with a grading system being applied to conventional and maximum intensity projection (MIP) images as follows:0 = nodule, but unlikely AVM, 1 = ground glass opacity (GGO), 2 = GGO with increased vascular network, 3 = GGO or nodule with single draining vein, 4 = GGO or nodule with equally sized afferent and efferent vessels, 5 = GGO or nodule with afferent and asymmetrically enlarged efferent vessels, 6 = true AVM with aneurysmal sac without the nodule or GGO. Total number of PAVM, cumulative PAVM grading (adding up individual PAVM grades), the highest grade given, total volume, and age were recorded for each patient. TTCE was graded as per Gazzaniga et al based on the number of bubbles (0 to 3) from pulmonary right to left shunt and then correlated with the variables of CTA and patient's age (Pearson correlation). Results: A total of 124 pulmonary lesions were identified on CTA, including; peripheral (n=112), central (n=10), and both (n=2); all the lesions were localized without diffuse form. The CTA grading was increased on MIP images in 39 out of 124 PAVMs on conventional CT. The distribution of grades on MIP included grade 0 (n=9), grade 1 (n=16), 2 (n=9), 3 (n=42), 4 (n=34), 5 (n=2), and 6 (n=12). The median size and volume were 3.9mm and 31.1mm 3 respectively. A statistically significant correlation was seen between all variables of CTA and TTCE (p<0.05), with the strongest correlation seen in those with the CTA highest grading (r=0.79, p<0.0001). Age did not correlate with any variables of CTA or TTCE grading. Conclusions: In children with HHT, GGO or nodule with single (grade 3) or two vessels (grade 4) were seen in two thirds of cases. MIP images enabled more precise detection of the afferent or efferent vessels. The highest grade in each patient had the strongest correlation with the severity of pulmonary right to left shunt. Unlike in adults, age was not an important factor in determining the severity of PAVM in children.

Each exam acquired a shortreadout scan (1.18msec \u00b10.38) and a long-readout scan (3.35msec \u00b10.74) at 3T. Short-readout scans, with longer scan times but negligible off-resonance blurring, were used as reference images and augmented with additional off-resonance for supervised training examples. Long-readout scans, with greater off-resonance artifacts but shorter scan time, were corrected by autofocus and Off-ResNet and compared to shortreadout scans by normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE), structural similarity index (SSIM), and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Scans were also compared by scoring on eight anatomical features by two radiologists, using analysis of variance with post-hoc Tukey's test. Reader agreement was determined with intraclass correlation. Results: Long-readout scans were on average 59.3% shorter than short-readout scans (P<0.001). The proposed method had superior NRMSE, SSIM, and PSNR compared to uncorrected images across \u00b11kHz off-resonance (P<0.01). The proposed method had superior NRMSE over -677Hz to +1kHz and superior SSIM and PSNR over \u00b11kHz compared to autofocus (P<0.01). Radiologic scoring demonstrated that long-readout scans corrected with Off-ResNet were non-inferior to shortreadout scans (P<0.01).",

These efforts included immediate intubation, high frequency ventilation, chest tube evacuation of pneumothoraces and inhaled nitric oxide for pulmonary hypertension. A retrospective medical record review compared fetal imaging biomarkers associated with pulmonary hypoplasia (including gestational age (GA) at onset of oligohydramnios, AFI, presence/appearance of kidneys, presence of urine in the bladder, appearance of lungs on MRI) in surviving and nonsurviving newborns. Results: Standard imaging biomarkers did not reliably predict poor outcome. Oligohydraminos was defined as AFI \u2264 5 cm or deepest vertical pocket (DVP) < 2 cm; anhydramnios was defined as absent amniotic fluid. Median GA at birth was 35.5 weeks. Intubation in the delivery room was required in 50% and pneumothorax occurred in 50% of subjects. 77% of the cohort survived to discharge home. Only 3/8 fetuses with anhydramnios survived. Mean GA at onset and duration of oligohydramnios did not differ significantly between survivors and non-survivors. 6/7 deaths occured in the delivery room; 1 NICU death occured at 12 days. 6/7 subjects who died had autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), all of whom had large echogenic kidneys; however, 9/16 other fetuses in this cohort also had ARPKD with large echogenic kidneys and survived. 6/7 subjects who eventually had a renal transplant did not require peritoneal dialysis. One subject is on dialysis awaiting transplant. Of 2 infants with a prenatal diagnosis of renal agenesis, one was found postnatally to have tiny dysplastic kidneys, and survived to transplant. Of 7 infants with no fluid in the bladder in utero, only 1 survived. Conclusions: Standard imaging biomarkers did not reliably predict survival. Fetuses can survive what is predicted to be \"lethal\" oligohydraminios if aggressive neonatal resuscitation takes place and renal replacement therapy is initiated. More hopeful counseling than is currently presented may be warranted.

Normal brain development was assessed by a rigorous review of each study firstly by review of the initial radiology report followed by further evaluation of the fetal brain images by an expert pediatric neuroradiologist. Gestational age was calculated using the current obstetric standard of care approach that references the estimated date of delivery recorded at the first-trimester ultrasound. The robust database of 855 normal fetal brain MRIs was distributed across training (70%), validation (10%) and testing (20%) sets for experimental evaluation. We developed a novel attention-aware deep learning network consisting of two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) working in parallel to combine whole slice image features with brain-specific features, derived from engineered attention maps. This innovative approach mimics the expert neuroradiologists' behavior, allowing a rotation-invariant auto-detection of the fetal brain and thus boosting the prediction outcomes. Regression model performance was evaluated by the R2 statistic. Results: Our attention-aware model achieved strong predictive performance (R2 = 0.93, Mean error = 7.4 days) of gestational age using multi-plane fetal MRI. Single-plane prediction of gestational age achieves an R2 of 0.88 (axial), 0.87 (coronal), and 0.83 (sagittal) with attention-map guidance. A standard CNN without attention enhancement was able to retain high R2 of 0.83, 0.84, and 0.81 for the corresponding axial, coronal, and sagittal MRI planes, respectively. Conclusions: Deep neural networks can accurately characterize healthy in utero brain development from fetal MRI. Clinical translation of such insights has the potential to improve early detection of normal and abnormal fetal brain maturation. The proposed deep learning algorithm could serve as an adjunct diagnostic tool in evaluating appropriate fetal neurodevelopment on MRI. including microtia (n = 9); low set ears (n = 17); external auditory canal malformation or atresia (n = 9); mass involving or abutting the external ear (n = 4, most commonly lymphatic malformations); preauricular skin tags (n = 3); and anotia (n = 2). The most commonly observed inner ear malformations included cochlear malformation (n = 6); absence and / or malformation of the semicircular canals (n= 4); vestibular malformation (n = 3); malformed internal auditory canals (n = 3); and absence of the inner ear structures (n = 1). Ear abnormalities were associated with syndromes on the basis of additional imaging findings, genetic testing and / or postnatal examination in a large number of cases (18/41) with the most commonly observed syndromes including CHARGE (n = 4), Trisomy 18 (n = 3), Trisomy 13 (n = 3), 22q11.2 duplication (n = 2), Brachio-Oto-Renal syndrome (n = 1), Trisomy 21 (n = 1), Trisomy 22 (n = 1), Goldenhar syndrome (n = 1), Klinefelter Syndrome (n = 1), and Cat-Eye Syndrome (n = 1). Syndromic associations were suggested in 5/41 cases, but were not confirmed due to redirected care. Vascular anomalies counted for 4/41 cases involving the external ear. In the remainder of the ear malformations, no syndromic correlation, genetic abnormality or unifying diagnosis was made. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that detailed evaluation of the inner and external ears should be performed in every evaluation of the fetus and malformation may suggest the presence of underlying syndromic condition. Purpose or Case Report: Greater than 60% of placentae from low birth weight infants show signs of hypoxic or ischemic injury from vascular hypo-perfusion. Placental fractional blood volume (FBV) is indicative of perfusion and may be used as a marker of local ischemia.

In this pre-clinical study, we investigated contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the estimation of placental FBV in a pregnant mouse model. A high T1 relaxivity blood-pool liposomal-gadolinium (liposomal-Gd) contrast agent, which does not permeate placental barrier in rodents, was used for the determination of placental FBV.",

Two articles focused on abuserelated fractures while many articles failed to exclude abuserelated fractures. Inconsistencies in fracture healing variables exist across articles, which limits many direct associations. When comparisons can be made, healing timelines vary between articles, potentially in part due to the retrospective nature of the research.

Animals were evaluated at 1 week and 6 weeks post implantation with CA, IVUS, black blood TSE MRI, contrast enhanced 3D radial MR angiography (MRA), MR 2D and 3D flow velocity mapping, and delayed enhancement imaging for fibrosis. In each subject, native IVC before and after the graft, proximal and distal graft anastomotic sites, and the mid graft were analyzed on all 3 modalities, and compared between weeks 1 and 6. Patterns of luminal distortion were assessed, and characterized using flow velocity changes, turbulence, energy loss, and tissue response as demonstrated on dynamic early contrast enhancement (DCE), and delayed enhancement (DE). Results: MRA yielded excellent morphometric definition of the native and grafted vasculature for luminal caliber and distortion when compared to angiography. There was good correlation between measurements of graft thickness obtained by IVUS and TSE. Some degree of stenosis was noted in all subjects with anastomotic and whole graft involvement, while there were no cases of rupture, aneurysm formation or infection. Unique information obtained from MRI included area deformation of the TEVG throughout the cardiac cycle, flow alterations and collateralization related to stenosis, estimates of wall shear stiffness and power loss, and estimate of host response at 1 and 6 weeks based on DCE and DE of the graft wall. Conclusions: MRI/MRA provides comprehensive assessment of TEVG by providing information on luminal architecture, wall thickness, graft integrity, flow perturbations and energy loss, which will be used to develop computational models to predict tissue engineered graft remodeling and stenosis.

Initially, success of intrahepatic lymphatic access and injection was evaluated. Imaging finds such as pericholecystic enhancement, mesenteric and retroperitoneal reflux, and visualization of the thoracic duct (TD) was assessed. Presence or absence of abnormal lymphatic perfusion to the peritoneal cavity, bowel, and lung and hila was determined. Images were also evaluated for hepatic vein contamination and peritoneal contamination. Disagreements between the 2 readers were solved by consensus. A chart review was performed for demographics and history. Results: A total of 21 patients (10 male) with a mean age of 7.4 years (range 4 months to 16.9 years, interquartile range 13.1 years) were identified. Clinical indications included pleural effusion (n=11), ascites (n= 7), protein losing enteropathy (PLE,n=6), anasarca (n=2), and intestinal lymphangiectasia (n=1). Two (10%) IH-DCMRLs were technically unsuccessful due to needle displacement. Pericholecystic enhancement (n=7) and reflux into the mesenteric (n=17) and retroperitoneal lymphatics (n=17) was present. Abnormal lymphatic perfusion to the peritoneal cavity (n=7), bowel (n=7), and lung (n=11) was seen.

Imaging was performed on a 3 Tesla platform (Philips Ingenia, software R5.3) or a 1.5 Tesla platform (Philips Achieva, software R5.3). Two pediatric body radiologists in consensus qualitatively compared results from REACT with Gd-MRA to evaluate whether it was diagnostically useful either as a complement or potential replacement. Results: We retrospectively reviewed a total 5 cases with both the REACT sequence and Gd-MRA. The clinical indications included pre-operative evaluation for vascular access, thoracic outlet syndrome, May-Thurner syndrome, deep venous thrombosis, and complex venolymphatic malformation. The REACT sequence was found to be equivalent at obtaining the diagnosis in all 5 cases. However, in 4 of the 5 cases, Gd-MRA provided improved contrast resolution and signal-to-noise compared with the REACT sequence. Only in the case of thoracic outlet syndrome were the images found to be noninferior. Conclusions: Our preliminary experience with REACT in children suggests that the sequence is robust and capable of providing diagnostic angiograms in a variety of clinical indications. One advantage of REACT is that it can be repeated as needed and is not constrained by timing of a contrast bolus. However, the major disadvantage of REACT is its lower contrast resolution and signal-to-noise ratio compared with Gd-MRA. Future studies with larger and more diverse sample sizes are needed to better validate whether REACT can obviate the need for Gd-MRA in more generalizable circumstances.

All data was acquired with subjects freely breathing. Results: Cones 4D flow reconstructions are feasible and show excellent delineation of renal vasculature in data acquired just under 5 minutes. By nature of the cones sampling trajectory, respiratory and bowel motion artifacts appear noise-like and incoherent. Similar image quality is observed after retrospectively undersampling data to simulate a 3-minute acquisition. Further, both aortic and renal arterial flow rates are conserved in the retrospectively undersampled acquisition. In a 7-minute acquisition, where the Cartesian and cones scan times are held constant, cones 4D flow provides superior image quality, but underestimates peak aortic flow by 26%.

            "text": "TheoryRosette trajectories employ oscillating gradient fields at two distinct frequencies to produce flower-like k-space traversal patterns first described by Doug Noll [1]. We extend this earlier work by using a novel rosette parameterization: If N is odd, q = { x | x = (2L-1)/N, L = (N+1+2m)/2, m \u00ce Z + } \\ Z + If N is even, q = { x | x = (2L)/N, L = (N-2+4m)/2, m \u00ce Z + } \\ Z + where N represents the number of petals, L the number of layers, m is an incrementing variable and Z+ is the set of all positive integers. MethodsAll scans were performed on a GE 750W with a 20 channel cardiac array. Ex Vivo: T2* phantoms containing distilled water, MnCl2 and 3% carrageenan in 50ml falcon tubes were constructed for T2* validation. A CRENSHAA sequence with q=2.2, FA= 15 degrees and TR 34 ms produced echoes at 1.1, 4.1, 6.7, 9.3 and 11.9ms. 350 repetitions were acquired, each successively incremented by a rotation angle of 137.5\u00b0 Exponential fitting was performed in MATLAB. Images were compared to a gold standard GRE multiecho sequence. In Vivo: A 31 y/o male volunteer was imaged using a CRENSHAA sequence. Selfgated, k-space magnitude CINE images were reconstructed at 30 phases with a 5 phase sliding window. All studies were IRB approved and conducted with informed consent. Purpose or Case Report: Cardiac CINE is a common MRI technique for cardiac evaluation, but requires multiple breathholds to acquire high quality images without respiratory motion artifacts. This in conjunction with rapid heart rate makes pediatric CINE imaging challenging. Neural networks can leverage previous exam data to learn how to reconstruct highly accelerated MRI data. Here we extend this to cardiac imaging, and present a deep learning-based reconstruction technique trained on fully-sampled healthy volunteer data. We show that our network outperforms combined parallel imaging and compressed sensing (PICS) reconstruction methods on 10x accelerated 2D CINE data with respect to common image quality metrics.",

For training, ten volunteer datasets are split slice-byslice into 155 slices, and then further augmented by random flipping, cropping, and variable-density undersampling (R=8-10). For evaluation, the remaining two volunteer datasets are retrospectively undersampled to simulate 10-fold acceleration with 25% partial echo.

Purpose or Case Report: Congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) is unique to fetuses infected with Zika virus (ZIKV) before birth and presents with distinct pattern of birth defects including characteristic brain abnormalities. The neurological manifestations in these infants with CZS have emerged lately and are well documented. However, the consequences of ZIKV exposure to fetuses of pregnant mothers and the neonates born to them were not thoroughly examined. Despite these ZIKVexposed neonates demonstrating normal head circumference at birth [1], they may have subtle brain abnormalities and neurodevelopmental deficits that are possibly associated with congenital ZIKV [2,3]. Since these ZIKV-exposed infants represent a larger population as compared to those with CZS, it becomes all the more important to examine the brains of this group. The purpose of this prospective study is to compare the brain MRI volume measures of otherwise normal appearing ZIKV-exposed infants to matched controls, with neurodevelopmental correlates.",

Purpose or Case Report: Surgery is an important option in the management of medically refractory epilepsy. Yet even in ideal surgical cohorts, a significant fraction of patients (typically 35-45%) do not achieve seizure freedom. This failure reflects in large part that pediatric focal epilepsy is a disorder of widespread cerebral cortical networks; some of these network alterations are epileptogenic and can drive recurrent seizures after resection. The goal of this study, therefore, was to define the relationship between global network architecture and seizure-free outcome in children selected for surgical management of focal epilepsy.",

These findings support the potential clinical relevance of brain network metrics in children with refractory epilepsy. Purpose or Case Report: Dystonia is one of the most common paediatric movement disorders, and often the most difficult to manage. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical treatment that modulates dysregulated motor circuits, and has been used in 321 medically refractory cases, with mixed outcomes. Factors preventing maximal benefit may include: heterogeneous disease aetiologies, suboptimal lead placement, and difficulty in programming. Surgical insertion currently relies on adultderived techniques and anatomic targeting. During programming, the clinician chooses which electrical settings, e.g. voltage, provide the greatest clinical benefit to an individual patient. Choosing these individualised parameters can be a tedious and often imprecise trial-and-error process. It requires multiple clinic visits, and reliance on difficult clinical observations. With appropriate targeting and stimulation programming, DBS can produce striking clinical benefits. We hypothesized that the imaging of our DBS-implanted paediatric dystonia patients could inform us on which neural networks and tracts should be modulated, resulting in improved clinical outcomes.",

The most closely associated neural network areas were the bilateral basal ganglia, cerebellum, and prefrontal cortex, all of known importance in motor circuitry. White matter tracts associated with the greatest clinical improvement were also involved in motor circuitry. Conclusions: Paediatric dystonia patients responded better to DBS treatment engaging specific networks and tracts of the motor circuit. These findings could be used to improve surgical technique and post-operative empiric electrical titration, thereby benefiting patients and their families through better care and clinical outcomes. Life-long mTORi therapy with extended imaging monitoring may be required to maintain therapeutic benefit.

Patients with SEGAs demonstrating \"clinically meaningful growth\" (resulting in SEGA diagnosis or offer of tumor directed intervention) on serial MRI exams were identified. Paired exams were reviewed by a subspecialty board certified pediatric neuroradiologist to determine changes in tumor volume first on non-GBCM-enhanced sequences (T2W, T1W), and subsequently on GBCM-enhanced T1W sequences. Wilcoxon rank sum tests were performed in R. Results: Of 68 patients in the TSC database, 9 (13%) had SEGAs. 6 of these patients had 7 SEGAs that demonstrated clinically meaningful growth on serial MRI exams. For these exam pairs, the distribution in measured changes in tumor volume was not significantly different when assessed with non-GBCM-enhanced sequences versus GBCM-enhanced sequences (p= 0.96), or between non-GBCM-enhanced sequence assessments (p= 0.88). Changes in tumor volume ranged from 148% to 115,050% increase. Conclusions: TSC patients often undergo a large number of GBCM-enhanced MRI exams. In our study, assessments of changes in SEGA volume on MRI were not significantly different between GBCM-enhanced and non-GBCM-enhanced sequences. Given the lack of clinical benefit, it is prudent to limit GBCM administration for routine MRI follow up of subependymal nodules and known SEGAs in patients with TSC.

            "text": "This institutional review board approved single-institution retrospective study evaluated consecutive pediatric patients, ages 2 to 18, who underwent abdominal ultrasound from February 2018 to September 2018. Diagnosis of fatty liver, obtained through the electronic medical record, was recorded on the basis of clinical notes, prior imaging tests, and liver biopsy pathology when available. Body mass indices (BMI) and normalized Z-scores using CDC's growth charts, were also extracted. Duplicate patients and those with absent clinical information or imaging were excluded. Using manually measured SCD as a reference standard, an image processing algorithm was developed to automatically extract the SCD measurement from manually selected B-mode images (one image per patient). Image processing steps included: 1) Region of Interest (ROI) placement, 2) image denoising (Gaussian filter), 3) contrast enhancement, 4) canny edge detection, 5) connected components detection using the binary image derived from step 4, 6) skin and Glisson capsule border detection, and 7) SCD calculation (distance between the detected skin and capsule). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to assess the diagnostic performance of BMI Z-scores and the SCD measurements for fatty liver. Results: 174 patients, including 26 with hepatic steatosis, were analyzed (mean age 125.6\u00b154.1 months, 74 males, 100 females). The root-mean-squared error (RMSE) between manually and automatically extracted SCD measurements was 5.06 mm. The area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for prediction of fatty liver was calculated to be 0.905 (95%CI: 0.856-0.954) for the BMI Z scores, 0.889 (95%CI: 0.818-0.961) for the manual SCD measurements, and 0.770 (95%CI: 0.668-0.873) for the algorithm-measured SCD.",

LIC was calculated using Monoexponential T2* (MonoExp) and Biexponential T2* (BiExp) models using both commercially available and an in-house developed software. The calculations were based on ROIs including the entire liver (ROI1), the periphery of the liver (excluding the major vessels) (ROI2) and the spleen (ROIcontrol). The LIC results were classified as normal (< 3.2 mg/dL), mild (3.2 -7 mg/dL), moderate (7 -15 mg/dL), and severe (> 15 mg/dL) as per commonly used treatment guidelines. Residuals and residuals ratios were calculated for each model (MonoExp and BiExp) in order to identify the best fitting model on each LIC category. A MonoE/BiExp residual ratio > 1.5 was considered to have a biexponential trend. Non-parametric tests and correlations were used, p < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: 182 patients (110 boys, 71 girls) with a mean age of 12.3 years (range or SD) were included in the analysis. For both ROI1 and ROI 2, there was a near perfect agreement between MonoExp using the commercial and the in-house software (r = 0.98, p < 0.001, and r = 0.99, p < 0.001, respectively). According to the MonoExp/BiExp residual ratio, the BiExp model fits better in patients with a LIC > 15 mg/dL (ROI1: ratio = 11.5, p < 0.001 and ROI2: ratio = 2.3, p < 0.001). For those with a biexponential best fit (n = 38), the proportion of slow (second) component was 0.06 (range 0.01 -0.11). In the internal control ROI (spleen), the MonoExp/BiExp ratio was not significantly different among different LIC categories (p = 0.46). Conclusions: Biexponential T2* relaxation model for LIC estimation fits better than the monoexponential model in patients with severe iron overload (LIC > 15 mg/dL) and can be used to more accurately determine LIC in these patients. The proportion of slow (second) component of the model might be related to the intra-cellular iron in the liver. Many studies have demonstrated that liver stiffness directly correlates with liver fibrosis. Several studies of liver fibrosis in post mortem autopsies have proven that liver fibrosis is a heterogeneous process.

Input is categorized based upon imaging workflow (PAPIC), with a free-text comment box for radiology experts to describe issues. Clinical specific data is automatically captured in the hospital information system (HIS). The imaging quality team further augments data collection by categorizing into granular quality elements to evaluate for themes and improvement opportunities, which are then communicated by weekly reports to section leadership for resolution. The collected information is deemed confidential and privileged peer review data. Results: This new mechanism was envisioned in 2017, built and implemented in the summer of 2018, with staff training and education prior to launch. Engagement and trends are being tracked and evaluated from July-Oct 2018. A total of 385 entries have been reported in OPEN. Of the 385 recorded entries, the largest category was acquisition issues (51%). Acquisition issues include subcategories such as artifacts, motion, technique, wrong exam, equipment errors and missing information. The second largest category was planning. This commonly included issues obtaining correct orders or protocols which lead to delay in patient care. Conclusions: OPEN is created as a non-punitive, user friendly, quality reporting tool in radiology. It seamlessly integrates with RIS/HIS to provide automatic contextual information, and causes little disruption to patient care, thereby promoting engagement and insight into opportunities for improvement in imaging.

Conclusions: Evaluation of the RCR-adapted pediatric trauma protocol showed relatively poor vascular and solid-organenhancement in the highest weight-group and high vascularenhancement in the lowest weight-group. Spleen-homogeneity and solid-organ-enhancement were insufficient in a substantial number of cases, mainly in higher weight groups.

Results: Proper immobilization and positioning skills help to improve the diagnosis of non-accidental trauma cases. This allows those children that are most vulnerable to receive the medical care and social work intervention that they require. Conclusions: When patients are immobilized correctly and optimal positioning is utilized the best images possible can be reviewed by Radiologists. The Radiologists are given the best opportunity to detect very subtle fractures that are often present in non-accidental trauma cases. Proper diagnosis of nonaccidental trauma allows for child welfare agencies to utilize protocols to get these children proper care. Purpose or Case Report: The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia first started additive manufacturing i.e. 3D printing in 2012 and has since renamed its laboratory to the Children's Hospital Additive Manufacture for Pediatrics (CHAMP 3D).

An in-house lab allows for convenient collaboration within direct workflow of many groups, but this convenience also comes at a cost. The involvement of building operations is essential to ensure space is feasible.Goals & MachinePrinter selection is interlocked with the lab's goals and can set limitations on project scope. The first steps in establishing a 3D lab would be to outline the ideal set of projects and find a machine to match, taking into consideration examining material, cost, applications, and space availability.Team & CollaborationsIt is important to have a dedicated team of radiologists, engineers, administrators, and technologists. Each plays a key role in running the lab, brainstorming projects, segmenting scans, and expanding opportunities.Cost CenterThe CHAMP lab has introduced an internal billing model. Departments are charged for their prints based on a combination of material used, time processed, and flat overhead rate. The overhead rate has the dual purpose of recouping the cost of running the lab and limiting frivolous printing.OutreachOutreach can greatly extend the possibilities of the lab, ranging from collaboration to education and even recruitment of new team members. Collaborations with AM/3D labs can be an excellent opportunity for resource and knowledge sharing. Education and Maker events provide networking and discussion on the newest methods. Internship for students can expand the team and promote interest in additive manufacturing. Results: In the last year alone, the CHAMP 3D Lab has supported over twenty-five different groups across the hospital and university. A new metric of success targeting papers, intellectual property, and grants (PIG) has been introduced to drive the focus of the lab and project. Conclusions: Hospitals around the world continue to establish additive manufacturing labs for research and clinical applications at an ever increasing rate. Strong planning techniques can greatly improve the effectiveness and success of the lab. Purpose or Case Report: Phantoms and task trainers are utilized in a variety of training and education purposes. Handsontraining with realistic tools allowsfor a controlled learning setting and practice. Unfortunately, these phantoms and trainers can have prohibitive costs and tend to lack pediatric options.

Additive manufacturing models can be printed in various types of plastic, rubber, powder, or metal to create a phantom. It can also be used to print molds for silicon pours, therefore allowing for detailed forming. Silicon ranges in a variety of softness, durability, and other certified properties. The design for these models can be generated from a combination of scans that can be generalized and anatomized. By referencing the scans, models can be very realistic in detail. In addition, features can be added to facilitate the use of the models. Results: Through experiments with designing phantoms, a few tips have been developed to accomplish a variety of effects. First is the use of printed models for embedded structures. A printed bone structure can be encased in soft silicone to give a realistic feel and visualization on imaging. The embedded parts can also be painted to alter the exogeneity. Additives, such as sand or Metamucil, can be mixed into silicon to alter the texture and exogeneity, creating varied regions in scans.Internal cavities can be a challenge when molding but are essential in medical trainers. Break molding and dissolvable materials allow for these cavities to be as detailed as external surfaces. Both processes start by embedding printed cavities and pathways in poured silicon. In break molding, the internal parts are forcibly cracked then pulled and/or poured out.

Results: There was a boost in May of 2018 to focus on improving customer service. When improving staff engagement initiatives, customer service scores have been on a slow and steady increase since utilizing the methods and materials. There has been a 3% increase in the departmental customer service scores within the past five months. If staff engagement efforts continue, a steady increase in scores is expected. Conclusions: When staff are engaged in the work they do and invested in the facility, and believe that the organization is invested in staff, it results in customer satisfaction. Methods & Materials: IH-DCMRL involves ultrasound guided injection of a gadolinium contrast agent into the intrahepatic lymphatic ducts followed by MRI of the chest and abdomen with dynamic time resolved imaging. Initially a 25 gauge 3.5 inch spinal needle is placed intrahepatically adjacent to a branch of the portal vein under ultrasound guidance. Needle position is confirmed with fluoroscopy. The patient is then transferred to the MRI suite. Following a heavily weighted 3D T2 weighted sequence, gadolinium is slowly injected into the liver lymphatics and dynamic T1 weighted MR imaging is performed every 5-20 seconds over 6-7 minutes. This is followed by a high resolution respiratory navigated 3D IR inherent gradient echo sequence. Results: MRI assessment during gadolinium injection of the intrahepatic lymphatics, can be successful technique for evaluation of the liver lymphatics, thoracic duct, and to visualize bowel perfusion as seen in PLE and peritoneal perfusion as seen in chylous ascites. Conclusions: IH-DCMRL is a promising cross-sectional imaging technique to evaluate liver lymphatic flow and can be helpful for assessment of certain conditions involving abnormal liver lymphatic flow.

Results: When scripting our interviewing process we try using questions that will help trigger for surgical and or wearable devices.As we all know the pressures of getting a diagnosis, as well as being a poor historian can sometimes interfere with how families respond to questions about devices but the connection between an ingestible device that is associated with the word pill becomes even more challenging.We need to continually change our MRI screening and interviewing processes with advancements in technology that can have an effect on being safe in the MRI environmentTo try and meet this challenge we had discussions with MR safety leaders, and decided on the following changes;Added the following change to our screening form, Ingestible(PillCam, SmartPill, etc.) with a Yes or No check boxScreening interviewing process,added these trigger questions;1.

Methods & Materials: I will describe the process of implimentation of rules and guidlines that we crrenttly use in our MRI safety process. Show the steps which were taken to update and improve our MRI safety culture. Results: Explain how our safety process is better know thatn it was two years ago. Conclusions: MRI safety is a on going process that will constsantly change as a department grows in size and as its patient numbers increase. With that being said the rules and guidelines must change as well. Purpose or Case Report: One treatment for congenital scoliosis is the use of spine-straightening rods. Previously, the rods that have been surgically implanted were non magnetic and required the patient to undergo additional surgeries (usually every 6 months) to extend the rod length as well as radiographs pre and post surgical to evaluate the distraction. Currently many of the rods in use at our institution are MAGnetic Expansion Control (MAGEC\u00ae) rods that can be extended magnetically with the use of an external remote controller, thereby no longer requiring repeated surgeries every 6 months. As a result, patients have distractions performed every other month. While this is a marvelous improvement, these patients are now receiving an increased number of radiographs to confirm lengthening and interval correction of their condition due to the ability to distract every other month versus every 6 months with non magnetic rods. Several studies investigated whether ultrasound could be used as an alternative to X-ray when measuring rod lengthening in order to reduce radiation exposure. The result showed that ultrasound correlated very well with X-ray measurements and that while X-ray would still be needed, ultrasound could be utilized to eliminate the number of X-rays done and thereby significantly reduce radiation exposure to the patient. We were asked by the orthopedic department to see if we could institute a protocol for ultrasound imaging at our institution for these patients based on Cheung's study. What began as a QI initiative has evolved into an imaging clinic for these patients. We will show that the implemented standardized protocol and imaging clinic reduced unnecessary radiation, improved time management and increased the quality of care these patients receive. We intend to share the knowledge we have acquired of this successful learning model with other facilities around the country.",

In order to better and more accurately diagnose the severity of the venous compression, an intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) allows the operator a full 360 degree view of the vessel. An IVUS catheter has an ultrasound transducer attached to the distal end of the catheter. There are three sizes of IVUS catheters; each size allows a specific viewing diameter based on size of catheter. The catheter is advanced through the area of concern, and the images are recorded and reviewed on a separate workstation. Individual screenshots and diameter measurements can be obtained and saved. If a flow limiting stenosis is present, further treatment such as angioplasty or stent deployment can be pursued. IVUS is particularly helpful in these situations because it allows precise targeting at the area of stenosis as well as post intervention imaging to evaluate the success of angioplasty/stenting.",

To avoid redundancy in responses from the same institution, participants were encouraged to identify one single person from their respective institution to respond to the survey. The name of the participants' institution was also requested to identify respondents from the same institution. Participants were excluded if pediatric liver transplantation was not performed at their institution, as well as if they were trainees. Results: Of the 1600 survey recipients, 50 (3%) responded to and completed it, representing 29 of 58 (50%) pediatric liver transplant centers within the United States. IOD was performed at 69% of pediatric transplant centers. In centers performing IOD, 47% performed examinations routinely with every pediatric liver transplant. The hepatic artery was the vessel most commonly routinely interrogated (87%), followed by the portal vein (83%) and hepatic veins (67%), although 50% reported that the exam protocol depended on the area of clinical concern. The surgeon and radiologist operated the transducer with relatively equal frequency. The pediatric radiologist rendered interpretation in 93% of institutions, although frequently in conjunction with the surgeon (30%). Surgeon preference (38%) was identified as the most common barrier to further expansion of IOD programs, followed by radiologist availability (25%). 47% of respondents deemed IOD \"extremely useful\" in the setting of pediatric liver transplantation. Conclusions: Despite the perceived utility of IOD in pediatric liver transplantation, there is considerable variability in the use of this technique. Our results support the notion of a team approach between surgeons and radiologists in further expanding the use of IOD in this population. Purpose or Case Report: We conducted this study to determine if there is an imaging biomarker associated with ALK mutations in patients with neuroblastoma(NB). MYCN oncogene amplification is identified in 20-25% of all NB cases and portends a poor prognosis. Aberrations of the ALK gene are also characteristic of the disease. Both are located on the p arm of the second chromosome, and are usually associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis.",

Purpose or Case Report: Lemierre's syndrome is an extremely rare condition characterized by initial oropharyngeal infection with development of septic thrombophlebitis and subsequently disseminated septic microemboli. The syndrome remains a disease of considerable morbidity and mortality. The incidence is approximately 3.6 cases per 1 million per year. It is commonly caused by gram-negative Fusobacterium necrophorum. However, less than a third of cases is brought on by other anaerobic bacteria. Here we present a rare case of a Lemierre's syndrome in a child caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). A 4-year old male presented to emergency department with unremitting fever, progressive painful submandibular swelling concerning for Ludwig's angina, vesicular lesions on the skin, and decreased level of consciousness. The patient was reported to have fallen onto his chin with resultant lip laceration and tooth avulsion. Fever and neck swelling developed two days later. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck revealed findings in keeping with clinically suspected Ludwig's angina including: soft tissue gas, and diffuse fat stranding involving the sublingual, perioral, and right submandibular spaces with extension to right sternoclavicular muscle, carotid and jugular vessels. No abscess was identified but a focal non-occlusive thrombus was seen in the right internal jugular vein. Additionally, the lung apices demonstrated multiple patchy densities raising concern for Lemierre's syndrome and prompting further evaluation with a contrast-enhanced chest CT. Chest CT confirmed the diagnosis demonstrating multiple, variable-sized, randomly distributed lung nodules with cavitation, and multifocal consolidation consistent with septic emboli. Blood culture and skin swab of vesicular lesions were positive for MRSA. On further discussion, it was revealed that the patient's father was recently treated for MRSA abscess. The patient was placed on intravenous antibiotics (vancomycin, rifampin, meropenem) and anticoagulants (tinazaparin) with improvements in symptoms and imaging findings within six weeks post admission.The learning points include:1) the need to critically evaluate lung apices and vasculature on neck CT in patients with evidence of soft tissue neck/oropharyngeal infection2) despite the rarity of Lemierre's syndrome, multiple cases caused by MRSA have been described. Purpose or Case Report: Infantile myofibromatosis is a rare condition consisting of benign fibrous tumors typically deposited in the skin, soft tissues, muscles, bones, and visceral organs. The entity can be solitary or multicentric. Although controversial, outcomes are generally worse in cases with visceral organ involvement. The prognosis is generally favorable in cases that lack visceral organ involvement, with a majority of cases showing spontaneous regression. The imaging findings of infantile myofibromatosis will be illustrated using both prenatal and postnatal imaging including ultrasound, MRI, radiography, CT, and bone scintigraphy. We also present gross specimen and pathology images. Our case involves a 33 week 4 day gestational age male fetus that initially revealed dilated loops of bowel on ultrasound. Fetal MRI was performed at 34 weeks and 4 days, which demonstrated the dilated loop was colon in the region of the hepatic flexure. Additionally, multiple solid-appearing lung masses were noted, which had not been visualized on ultrasound. Because of concern for a possible metastatic process, the entire fetus was thoroughly imaged, but no primary source was found. The differential diagnosis that was given on the fetal MRI included metastatic disease from the mother or fetus, infantile myofibromatosis, or infectious etiology. The mother underwent induction of labor at 35 weeks 4 days, and the baby was born via uncomplicated vaginal delivery. To exclude transplacental metastases, the mother underwent dermatologic skin check, mammography, colonoscopy, and head CT, all of which were negative. Postnatal radiographs of the baby revealed a focally dilated loop of bowel, and the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy. In the OR, nodules were noted on the small bowel serosa resulting in a bowel obstruction. Chest radiograph and CT also confirmed the presence of multiple solid lung masses. Bone scintigraphy was negative. Pathology from one of the bowel nodules revealed infantile myofibroma. Our patient has not undergone any therapeutic treatment, and follow up imaging has demonstrated continued spontaneous regression of the lung masses. Although infantile myofibromatosis is a rare entity, it is important to include in the differential diagnosis in a fetus with multiple solid-appearing lung masses. Throughout the clinical course of these patients, imaging plays an imperative role in the assessment of these lesions.",

            "text": "Peeing Purpose or Case Report: Caudal duplication syndrome is a rare entity that involves duplication of various structures arising from the embryonic cloaca and notochord. This presentation outlines the case of a 38-year-old G2P1 woman referred to our institution at 21 weeks gestation for anomalies detected on antenatal ultrasound. Antenatal ultrasound demonstrated sagittal duplication of the bladder, duplex phallus, a bifid scrotum and a horseshoe kidney. A subsequent fetal MRI confirmed those findings and also demonstrated apparent duplication of the colon and dysmorphic lumbosacral spine. Following delivery, the baby passed urine via both urethras and meconium via a right-sided anus; there was a left-sided anal dimple with an imperforate anus. VCUG showed no communication between the two bladders. A colovesical fistula was demonstrated between the left bladder and colon, which is likely the redundant duplicated colon with the imperforate anus. MRI of the abdomen and pelvis showed a lipomeningocele with attempted sacral duplication, redemonstrated duplication of the pelvic organs, and confirmed absence of a left-sided rectum and sphincteric complex. Caudal duplication syndrome is a complex malformation, the management of which often requires a multidisciplinary approach involving radiology, general surgery, urology, and neurosurgery. This case illustrates the findings of this rare entity with good correlation between fetal and postnatal imaging. It also highlights respective contributions of the various imaging modalities in guiding management, which usually entails staged surgical correction. CT showed the \"hyperattenuating rim\" sign. This report is the first reported female pediatric case of FFLAT that was diagnosed with US and CT, given a trial of analgesics, and definitively cured via minimally invasive surgical excision. A 13-year-old female presented to the emergency department with episodic waxing and waning abdominal pain for three days. The pain had localized to the mid-epigastrium and worsened with deep inspiration. On examination, vital signs were within normal limits. Focal tenderness was elicited upon palpation of the epigastrium. Laboratory evaluation revealed a mild leukocytosis 14.2 x 109/L, normal range (3.9-10.6 x 109/L). Results: Ultrasound demonstrated an irregularly marginated hyperechoic mass in the epigastric region that extended into falciform ligament. Confirmatory CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis with IV and oral contrast revealed mass-like stranding of the intraperitoneal fat in the epigastric region with a classic ovoid hyperattenuating rim sign. The vessels extending into the falciform ligament did not demonstrate contrast enhancement further raising concern for torsion. Surgical consultation was obtained. Conservative management was recommended via a trial of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication. Despite several weeks of treatment, the patient's pain persisted without significant improvement. Transumbilical laparoscopic excisional findings strongly suggested an acute on chronic inflammatory process confined to the fatty appendage of the falciform ligament. The pathologist described the resected mass as fibrofatty rubbery tissue. The pre-operative diagnosis of FFLAT was confirmed. The patient was found to have complete resolution of pain at her two-week post-operative follow-up.",

            "text": "Purpose or Case Report: Although acute appendicitis is thought to be result from luminal obstruction of the appendix, rarely it may develop following abdominal trauma. Traumatic appendicitis is thought to occur through direct injury to the appendix, or as a response to other abdominal organ injury. On the other hand, in patients with other organ injury, some distension of the appendix can occur with surrounding free fluid secondary to trauma, mimicking appendicitis. While the clinical presentation of traumatic appendicitis is similar to that of traditional appendicitis, differentiation between reactive appendiceal changes in the setting of traumatic injury to other intra-abdominal organs is important, as the latter will not require appendectomy. We present two pediatric patients in whom following initial suspicion of acute appendicitis, ultrasonography (US) identified mildly enlarged fluid-filled and hyperemic appendix with out of proportion complex fluid, raising the suspicion of previously unsuspected abdominal trauma. Upon further examination, injury to other abdominal solid organs was discovered as the primary cause of patient's presentation and appendiceal findings were reactive to abdominal solid organ injury. In cases of suspected appendicitis, visualization of significant free fluid with dense debris on ultrasonography (US) calls for more careful examination to assess clues of other abdominal injury. Purpose or Case Report: We report a case of a 7 year old female who presented to urology clinic due to recurrent urinary tract infections that had started 4 years ago. The patient also reported symptoms of urge incontinence and nocturnal enuresis beginning at the same time. She previously consulted an adult gynecologist, which showed no physical exam evidence of genitourinary abnormalities. An MRI of the abdomen and pelvis was also ordered at that time which reported a normal exam except for a small left renal cyst. At our institution she underwent DMSA renal scan, which was normal. She underwent a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG), which showed no vesicoureteral reflux. However, during the VCUG, an incidental note was made of large amounts of vaginal reflux extending into the cervix, uterus, and with spillage into the peritoneal cavity presumably via the salpinges. Conclusions: Extension of contrast into the peritoneal cavity via vaginal reflux on VCUG has previously been reported only in patients with genitourinary anomalies. However, this patient had prior workup demonstrating no definite genitourinary abnormalities. This case suggests that reflux of contrast to the peritoneal cavity may be possible in patients with otherwise normal genitourinary anatomy. Purpose or Case Report: Extramedullary hematopoiesis (EH) is defined as hematopoiesis occurring in organs outside of the bone marrow. It occurs in diverse conditions, including fetal development, normal immune responses, and pathological circumstances. These sites of extramedullary hematopoiesis may present as masses mimicking malignancy or produce symptoms due to pressure effects. In the setting of an existing malignancy they may appear as metastatic deposits signifying progression of disease. It is essential to confirm this due to its prognostic and treatment implications.We report a 2-year-old little girl who presented initially with an acute history of ataxia, nystagmus, tremor, mydriasis and bruises on her left forehead. A solid left suprarenal mass was detected and a diagnosis of Stage 4 Neuroblastoma and Opsoclonus-Myoclonus syndrome was established. Subsequently she was on treatment which included chemotherapy, IVIG and stem cell transplant. On an MRI of the abdomen done a year later, a single lesion was detected in the right lobe of the liver. On subsequent short term follow up, innumerable scattered lesions were seen in the hepatic parenchyma and were thought to represent metastases.",

            "text": "Christopher J. Purpose or Case Report: Introduction: The management of gastrobronchial fistula (GBF) is not well defined in the literature. First line management is non-operative, allowing time for the fistula to close naturally. Surgical intervention is implemented when non-operative management fails. In medically complex patients, who often fail non-operative management, surgical procedures for closure remain high risk for complications.Case: We present a 2 year-old female with congenital esophageal atresia, duodenal atresia and annular pancreas. Beginning October 2015, she underwent multiple surgical procedures resulting in a multitude of complications. In August 2017, she transferred to our institution for management. Additional immediate operative intervention was pursued given the presence of the GBF. Despite two attempts at operative repair, the fistula recurred. Interventional radiology, consulted March 2018, developed a plan to place a percutaneous pigtail catheter in the esophagus through the dehiscent stomach wall from an external chest tube entry site, creating an iatrogenic enterocutaneous fistula (ECF). Diversion of flow from the GBF to the ECF was hypothesized to allow a conservative alternative for closure and tissue healing to occur. Initially, a 12 French (F) pigtail catheter was placed through the gastric wall into the esophageal pouch allowing the formation of the ECF tract. The patient returned for catheter downsizing to 8F three weeks later. A third intervention was performed to reposition the catheter to ensure that the tissues remained as dehydrated as possible. In May 2018, a 7 mm Cook Biodesign SIS fistula plug was placed. The 8F catheter was used to place a guide wire through the tract, then removed. The AFP bioplug, soaked in contrast to facilitate use of fluoroscopy, was placed through the mouth to seal the gastric wall. Placement was confirmed with a rigid esophagoscope and fluoroscopy. One week later, esophogram confirmed no leak. At 1 month follow-up the patient had no evidence of right pleural fluid and remains without evidence of fistula at five months. The skin site is well-healed.Discussion: In this case, an ECF was closed with a Cook Biodesign SIS fistula plug allowing for a successful non-operative strategy after multiple failed operative revisions. The plug has FDA approval for the treatment of anal fistula, but given the positive outcome in this case, its use in esophagocutaneous fistulas may be a viable off-label option for other patients.

CT of the head performed at that time showed minimal high attenuation material throughout the right parietal cortical reported as a small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage. After it became clear that the patient was having uncontrolled seizures that may have contributed to the original trauma, he was placed on anti-epileptic medication and referred for MRI. Results: Multiple MRI's were performed with and without contrast over the next 6 months. The findings on the CT were found to be due to thickening of the leptomeninges which exhibited robust contrast enhancement, greatest in the right parietal lobe. Multifocal hemorrhages were observed in the left cerebral hemisphere over the course of the exams. A diagnosis of Sturge-Weber Syndrome was assigned. Since the leptomeningeal enhancement showed progression over 5 months, a surgical biopsy was performed. Upon entry into the calvarium, the surface of the brain was found to be dark brown in color. Biopsy revealed the diagnosis of leptomeningeal melanocytosis. Conclusions: Leptomeningeal melanocytosis is a rare disorder that can be confused with infectious, inflammatory, and/or vascular abnormalities. The disease is typically fatal with a short life expectancy following diagnosis. Careful attention on follow-up of leptomeningeal enhancement is essential to exclude a proliferative or neoplastic process. Purpose or Case Report: Ectopic thymic tissue may be found in the neck in up to 20% of the general population. Intrathyroidal thymic rest has been described as a rare entity, present in as many as 1% of children. The course of thymic migration parallels the thyroid and parathyroid glands, which explains their similar ectopic locations. While the natural history of these lesions has not been well studied, it is likely that there is involution of thymic rests with age. A few individual case reports have described the imaging features of intrathryoidal thymic rests confirmed by histopathology and flow cytometry.

Up to sixty percent of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors express ALK which may help establish the diagnosis of the inflammatory mass as an IMT. The masses can occur in a variety of locations and have non-specific imaging findings, which will be reviewed.We present three cases, each in a different location:Case 1: 7 year old female presents with chronic cough and persistent right middle lobe abnormality on chest x-ray with concern for pneumonia or inhaled foreign body.

As knowledge about the genetic and histopathologic underpinnings of TAA grows, management will be guided by multidisciplinary teams. In order to maintain value in these teams, the pediatric radiologist must understand the varied causes of TAA, the underlying histopathology, and the treatment implications.

Purpose or Case Report: Congenital heart diseases often occurs secondary to a variety of insults and rotational errors during development in utero. These can range from a spectrum of simple to more complex pathologies including arterial switches. It is important for radiologists to recognize the embryology and complications of arterial switches to further management. Today largely secondary to new advances in technology both corrected and uncorrected arterial switches are diagnosed more commonly; previously many patients with arterial switches may not have survived into adulthood.In utero, the primitive truncus is normally positioned anterior and midline. It eventually divides into the aorta and the pulmonary artery, which then rotates clockwise 150 degrees such that the pulmonary artery lies anterior to and left of the aorta. When variations occur it can result in a congenitally corrected transposition such as L-transposition of the great arteries (L-TGA) where the two ventricles are morphologically switched in position. With L-TGA, the truncus rotates 30-degrees clockwise which results in the aorta being anterior and leftward in relation to the pulmonary artery.In uncorrected transposition (R-TGA) the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle, secondary to a 30-degree counterclockwise rotation of the primitive truncus, the aorta is then located rightward and anterior to the pulmonary artery. This condition needs to be corrected surgically due to cyanosis resulting from the right ventricle not being able to supply the systemic circulation. Other variations of arterial switches that can occur is situs inversus where the rotation of the aorta and pulmonary artery is completely opposite of that which would be considered normal. Lastly in truncus arteriosus, the primitive truncus does not divide into a separate aorta and pulmonary artery. We will provide several cases from our institution of arterial switches on imaging as well as diagramatic representative models describing the embryology of how arterial switches and rotations occur. We also discuss the repairs and complications of these cases. Conclusions: Congenital arterial switches and complications from repairs can be confusing but are becoming more commonplace. It is thus important for radiologists to understand the embryology and identify the imaging characteristics.",

Cutaneous capillary malformation aspect, color Doppler ultrasound and MR findings will be described. Lung AVM has never been reported in RASA1 except in our series. Conclusions: Patients with RASA1 mutations have a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. CM is the clue for the diagnosis, particularly if the CM has the pale halo. However, the AVM criterion for extracranial lesions has to be clarified. Most lesions in our series behave more like a capillary hypervascularization without AV shunting. Thus, the presence of extracranial/spinal true AVMs seems to be rare. The integration of genetic, clinical and imaging findings is important to have a better understanding of the disease and to offer the best treatment.",

These complications can relate to alteration in flow dynamics, treatment changes, and/or sequelae of associated syndromes (Trisomy 21, 22q deletion syndrome, Heterotaxy, PHACES). The purpose of this exhibit is to highlight extracardiac complications of CHD and to review their imaging findings. Imaging findings to be reviewed will include catheter thromboses, necrotizing enterocolitis, arterial ischemic strokes, infections, malrotation, pulmonary complications related to prematurity, prolonged intubations, and associated syndromes, and complications of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

The improved resolution and anatomic detail of the renal parenchyma offered by MRI can assist with identification, localization, and characterization of cystic lesions which are less clearly visualized on ultrasound. Advanced imaging adds value through enabling prenatal prognostication and patient counseling. In this presentation, we evaluate the spectrum of renal cystic abnormalities at the microscopic and macroscopic scale, and review the patterns of disease by cyst location, effect on parenchymal integrity, and obstruction of the collecting system. A clearer understanding of the diverse appearances and broad spectrum of outcomes of these fetal anomalies can contribute to more detailed treatment planning and more precise, familycentered care.In this presentation, we review the varied patterns of cystic renal disease as identified on fetal MRI, highlighting those forms known to be more associated with perinatal morbidity and mortality. Further, we correlate their appearance on MRI with pre-and post-natal US imaging, as well as pathologic findings. Finally, we will describe secondary prenatal imaging biomarkers that may be valuable in counseling and also with both definitive and palliative surgical planning.",

When compared to cross-sectional imaging, CEUS has many advantages given its relative low cost and ability to be performed at the bedside, without the need for sedation or exposure to ionizing radiation. Diagnostic information is yielded through the qualitative evaluation of parenchymal enhancement patterns as well as quantification of microbubble perfusion kinetics from which time intensity curves are derived and additional perfusion parameters can be extrapolated. Given the 2-dimensional nature of the modality, a strategically designed scanning protocol is necessary to obtain the aforementioned quantitative values. The purpose of this exhibit is to demonstrate the current understanding of brain CEUS and educate on the brain CEUS protocol used for the diagnosis of neonatal brain pathology.

Results: Prenatal findings in the normal fetus and in disorders of sexual development fetal will be illustrated with postnatal correlation. Conclusions: DSD is a complex group of disorders requiring an understanding of anatomical variations of genitalia and the diseases within each group. US and MR contribute to the prenatal detection of DSD, help narrow the differential diagnosis and help direct prenatal and postnatal genetic testing and imaging. Purpose or Case Report: The presacral space is composed of multiple tissue types, including osteochondral, mesenchymal, neurogenic, vascular and lymphatic. The presence of these tissues leads to a long and complex differential for a presacral mass in a pediatric patient. Specifically, the differential also includes anterior sacral meningocele, enteric cyst, vascular malformations, neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroma, schwannoma, neurofibroma, rhabdomyosarcoma, lymphomatous masses, giant cell tumor, aneurysmal bone cyst, osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and chordoma. Imaging plays a key role in characterizing these masses and treatment planning. Familiarity with the common presacral masses of infancy and childhood is therefore necessary for the pediatric and general radiologist.Once an osteochondral or neurogenic mass is excluded, and a predominantly cystic presacral mass is present, the primary differential consists of a collection of developmental or congenital masses including sacrococcygeal teratoma, anterior meningocele, low flow vascular malformation, and an enteric duplication cyst. We will review the common imaging features and associations of these cystic masses by presenting a series of cases. Additional examples of solid and osteochondral presacral masses will be included where appropriate for comparison in order to avoid characterization pitfalls and highlight teaching points. Purpose or Case Report: Prenatal screening and diagnosis of fetal anomalies rely upon ultrasound studies (US). US is generally considered safe during pregnancy. It is estimated that 1% of all neonates are born with a congenital heart defect that makes careful standardized examination of the fetal heart a mandatory step during all fetal US exams. US examination of the fetal heart requires at least analysis of the fetal situs, the four-chamber (4CH) view and the three-vessel view (3V). In the evaluation of the fetal heart, it is now worldwide accepted that the three-vessel trachea (3VT) view should be obtained, if technically feasible, in supplement of the other classical fetal cardiac views (4CH, 3V).The relevance of adding the 3VT view is that some congenital cardiovascular abnormalities, potentially significant for fetal outcome, can only be diagnosed with this view; these malformations include vascular rings and right aortic arches.",

Purpose or Case Report: Congenital anomalies causing lower extremity shortening can result from dysgenesis or agenesis of the bones of the thigh, leg or foot; they are generally a very uncommon occurrence, with an incidence on the order of one case per 1,000,000 to one case per 100,000 births. These conditions result in varying degrees of morbidity, ranging from gait dysfunction to complete lack of the ability to ambulate. The accurate characterization of such an anomaly may be challenging prenatally, but can have significant impact on prognosis and treatment planning.We present a collection of cases depicting the spectrum of prenatally diagnosed anomalies of limb development, including proximal focal femoral deficiency, multiple cases of varying degrees of fibular and tibial hemimelia, amniotic band syndrome, benign uterine packing, neurofibromatosis, clubfoot anomaly and rocker bottom foot, all of which were evaluated on prenatal ultrasound and/or fetal MRI. Accurate prenatal diagnosis is extremely important for prognosis, treatment planning and riskstratification for associated congenital anomalies. The purpose of this poster will be to highlight the imaging features by both fetal MRI and prenatal US, discuss potential diagnostic pitfalls and review the clinical implications of this interesting spectrum of congenital disorders. We will describe a methodical approach to assessment of these patients. Our recommendations include: prenatal US to include a complete set of bilateral long bone and foot length measurements; lateral and footprint views of the fetal foot; views of both tibiae and fibulae bilaterally; views of the spine and upper extremities, a thorough search for other abnormalities; fetal MRI for complex cases or when US findings are limited; and a complete family and maternal history, including notation of family stature.Examples of the classic appearance of these conditions will be presented.

Although imaging at 3 Tesla affords improved spatial resolution to visualize and define pathologic entities, the increased prevalence of artifacts at these higher field strengths, particularly in the setting of multiple gestations, requires familiarization on the part of both the technologist and radiologist to ensure diagnostic images are successfully obtained. Purpose or Case Report: Midface anomalies in the fetus can present with a range of severity and corresponding neonatal morbidity, on a spectrum from cosmetic disturbance to airway obstruction. Immediate postpartum complications include lifethreatening hypoxia and feeding disturbances. These anomalies not only present immediate difficulties but also often exist within a variety of syndromes with long-term consequences, affecting various organ systems. While screening ultrasound frequently can identify deviations from normal, fetal MRI may provide more detailed and high-resolution imaging for the characterization of midface anomalies and associated prenatal disease.The identification of facial anomalies in utero should prompt further investigation for associated abnormalities, and will also allow for improved prenatal counseling, which can prepare parents for the immediate postpartum management including surgical planning and resource allocation. It furthermore provides a foundation to shape family expectations and to begin to frame psychosocial support, allowing parents to engage mentally and emotionally with the medical and surgical course that awaits.In this presentation, we highlight the normal fetal midface as seen on MRI at various stages of development, and outline a systematic approach for evaluation of the fetal midface structures. Recognition of this typical appearance will allow the radiologist to identify the range of possible abnormalities that can occur and which can shape prognosis when properly identified. Various cases of midface anomalies will be reviewed and linked to their clinical significance, including cases with associated intracranial anomalies and deficiencies in swallowing and respiration.",

Location of the DJJ to the right of the left pedicle on the anterioposterior view or anterior in the lateral view was defined as IRA. We evaluated three types of IRA based on current literature: nonrotation (entire colon in the left abdomen, cecum in the left lower quadrant and the small bowel in the right abdomen), atypical malrotation (DJJ between midline and left pedicle), and typical malrotation (IRA that cannot be defined as nonrotation or atypical malrotation).

We will then provide a sample of imaging protocols when Eovist is used for hepatic mass evaluation and for biliary indications. We will review benefits of Eovist in characterizing a variety of pediatric hepatic neoplasms, including hepatoblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, hepatic adenomas, and regenerative nodules, with mention of pathologies that do not follow traditional patterns (i.e., inflammatory adenomas). After this, we will cover biliary applications, including choledochal cysts, biliary obstruction, and postoperative bile leak. Finally, we will review some limitations of Eovist; notably, we will mention several scenarios where the hepatobiliary phase could not be achieved, and recommendations for how to approach these cases. Purpose or Case Report: Abdominal pain is common presentation to the pediatric emergency department, and appendicitis remains the most common pediatric surgical emergency. While the imaging workup of pediatric appendicitis typically begins with ultrasound, MRI is increasingly being used for problem-solving and to further evaluate equivocal ultrasound results.

Purpose or Case Report: Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of rare genetic disorders that arise from at least 19 gene mutations for proteins that are involved in skin integrity. EB affects 1 out of 20,000 births in the United States and results in fragile skin that easily blisters from any minor friction or mechanical trauma. Other organ systems can also be seriously affected. The chronic skin inflammation and infections also places patients at risk for developing squamous cell carcinoma. Unfortunately, there is currently no cure for EB. The standard of care is supportive therapy and includes daily wound care, specialized dressings, and pain control.Because of the wide spectrum of systemic symptoms, there are numerous imaging findings that can be seen in patients with EB. These radiologic features can be categorized by body system including: 1) cardiac; 2) respiratory; 3) gastrointestinal; 4) genitourinary; 5) musculoskeletal; and 6) prenatal/fetal.There are various precautions that must be taken when performing any type of imaging study or anesthetic procedure for a patient with EB. These include but are not limited to: avoiding adhesives on the skin, providing special care when moving a patient, supporting pressure points on the imaging table, using large amounts of sterile water-based gel for ultrasound probes, and taking special care to protect the patient's skin, airway and oral cavity during anesthesia or sedation events.The purpose of this poster is to: 1) review the various clinical presentations, pathologies, and associated imaging findings involved in EB, 2) examine imaging and anesthetic concerns when dealing with patients with EB, and 3) discuss the imaging and anesthesia approach used when evaluating EB patients. Purpose or Case Report: In this exhibit we will describe a fairly new surgical procedure -total pancreatectomy and islet autotransplant (TPIAT). TPIAT is an uncommon procedure performed in children who suffer from chronic or recurrent acute pancreatitis. The purpose of the exhibit is to learn about the selection criteria, the surgery itself, and the imaging features of surgical complications. Candidates are selected for surgery based on a multitude of factors including severity and chronicity of pain, laboratory evaluation of pancreatic exocrine and endocrine function, and imaging features of chronic pancreatitis on MRCP and/or endoscopic ultrasound. In the surgical procedure, the pancreas and duodenum are resected, islet cells are isolated and then infused through the portal vein into the liver. A splenectomy is performed and continuity of the GI tract restored. Patients may spend three weeks in the hospital after surgery. Months after the infusion, the islet cells will be embedded within the liver and begin to produce insulin. The primary goal of this procedure is to relieve debilitating pain and improve quality of life, for which this procedure is around 90% successful. The secondary goal of the procedure is to retain islet cell function. In this regard, approximately 40% of the pediatric patients will regain complete islet cell function, 30% will regain partial function while 30% will have no islet cell function.",

The internal (deep) reference point of cursor placement for measuring the muscle wall thickness in the longitudinal view was as follows: a in 46%, b in 27%, c in 30%, d in 1% and e in 2% of the studies. Conclusions: New US technology provides more detailed anatomy and this affects measurements for muscle wall thickness. Considering that a millimetre can make a measurement fall into the abnormal category resulting in surgical treatment such differences in practice must be highlighted and recommendations need to be clarified. We believe that the largely abandoned diameter measurement, in the transverse or longitudinal views, may offer a solution as it is not defined by any internal layers. Purpose or Case Report: Bowel obstruction in the neonate is common. When neonatal intestinal obstruction is suspected, initial workup may include abdominal radiographs or ultrasound; however, in most busy pediatric radiology practices fluoroscopy is indicated to diagnose the cause, which helps the surgeon make management decisions. Accurate diagnosis is key to the successful management of these neonates. The fluoroscopist should be mindful of the methods and techniques which make evaluation of distal bowel obstruction straightforward and efficient. This exhibit will detail the rationale and protocol to perform the optimal contrast enema, which is essential to have a chance to reliably distinguish the several causes of distal bowel obstruction in neonates. Will include examples with imaging findings and differential diagnoses. Purpose or Case Report: Direct impact upon the bicycle handlebars is an especially harmful mechanism of injury in children. Pediatric patients who present following direct impact of the bicycle handlebars upon the abdomen are much more likely to suffer internal organ injury and require operative intervention than those who present following a bicycle accident without direct impact upon the handlebars.Unfortunately, bicycle handlebar trauma is not only a damaging mechanism of injury, but also a treacherous one. Physical exam findings can be subtle; these children often appear misleadingly well. Many such children are initially misdiagnosed and sent home prematurely only to re-present. Delays in definitive diagnosis are typical.The radiologist, therefore, by aiding in the timely identification of injuries and determination of any need for surgery, can make a valuable contribution to patient care.Our cases include a 9-year-old girl with a puncture wound and abscess in the medial thigh musculature, a 13-year-old male with a penetrating wound to the left lower abdominal quadrant with extensive retroperitoneal and extraperitoneal hematoma and other injuries, a 14-year-old male with a hematoma in the right lower abdominal quadrant, and a 7-year-old boy with a liver laceration, each of whom suffered a bicycle handlebar impact to the abdomen.As companion cases, we also present a 12-year-old boy with a transected pancreas following an ATV rollover which involved impact of the handlebars upon the abdomen, and a 49-year-old man who sustained a shattered kidney in a bicycle accident.",

Purpose or Case Report: Pancreatic neoplasms are rare in children and young adults, with an incidence of 0.46 per million under 30 years of age. Fortunately, children with a pancreatic neoplasm have a better prognosis than adults. The better prognosis and rarity of disease both contribute to the fact that pancreatic malignancies account for less than 0.2% of cancerrelated deaths.Ultrasound is often the initial imaging modality to identify a pancreatic neoplasm due to its use for evaluation of symptoms such as upper abdominal pain, a palpable epigastric mass, or jaundice. Known pancreatic masses, or those detected initially by ultrasound should be imaged with CT or MRI to best characterize the mass and its relationship to adjacent structures, particularly the vasculature. Nuclear medicine plays a role in imaging of some pancreatic neoplasms depending on histology.Once a pancreatic neoplasm is identified, the radiologist is tasked with making a diagnosis from a differential diagnosis list of rare tumors. Primary pancreatic neoplasms are divided into epithelial and nonepithelial types. The epithelial tumors are more common and may be further subdivided into exocrine or endocrine subtypes. Epithelial exocrine tumors are the most common in children. Examples of these tumors include the two most common pediatric pancreatic neoplasms pancreatoblastoma and solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms. Endocrine tumors are uncommon. While functioning endocrine tumors can occur, non-functioning tumors are more common and are associated with syndromes such as von Hippel Lindau, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, and tuberous sclerosis. Nonepithelial tumors are also rare and include a number of different entities such as lymphoma, neurofibroma, and teratomas. Finally, the pancreas is an extremely rare site of metastasis. Pancreatic metastases can occur with multiple primary malignancies including neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and osteosarcoma.This exhibit will describe the imaging work-up of pancreatic tumors in children.",

            "text": "Awareness among pediatric radiologists about imaging findings in eating disorders is crucial to the diagnosis and management. Purpose or Case Report: M\u00fcllerian Duct Anomalies (MDA) are a broad category of congenital deformities of the urogenital structures due to abnormal development, fusion, or resorption of the fetal M\u00fcllerian Ducts. By definition, the M\u00fcllerian Ducts are the paired fetal structures that are located medially to the Wolffian Ducts and develop into the Fallopian Tubes, uterus, cervix, and upper two-thirds of the vagina. The multitude of symptoms associated with MDAs vary broadly in severity, ranging from patients with no symptoms and incidentally discovered MDAs to patients with primary infertility, recurrent pregnancy loss and other reproductive problems.There are well documented associations of MDAs with other genitourinary malformations. The most commonly reported is renal agenesis, which accounts for up to 30% of all associated renal anomalies in the setting of MDA, however abnormalities including ureteral remnants with ectopic insertion or collecting system duplication have been reported as well. The overall incidence of MDAs varies, but have been estimated to be approximately 1-5% within the general population and up to 13-25% in patients with recurrent pregnancy loss.The most commonly accepted system of classification of the various types of MDAs is that of the American Fertility Society, which divides MDAs into seven categories. However, there is often confusion as to how to categorize MDAs demonstrating characteristics of more than one class. Medical imaging is of essential importance for both this reason and for appropriate planning of therapy. The imaging of suspected MDAs involves the implementation of a combination of 3D Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Sonohysterography, Hysterosalpingraphy and/or laparoscopy. Sonography and MRI have the benefits of being the least invasive methods of diagnosis.The goal of our educational exhibit will provide an overview of the embryology and pathophysiology related to a broad variety M\u00fcllerian Duct Anomalies. We will discuss the common imaging techniques employed in the workup of patients with M\u00fcllerian Anomalies. In addition, we provide a plethora of interesting cases from our home institution including a case of Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser Syndrome, Obstructed Hemivagina and Ipsilateral Renal Anomaly (OHVIRA), cloacal abnormality, bicornuate uterus and other complex cases utilizing a variety of imaging modalities. Purpose or Case Report: Adnexal torsion is a common emergency room query in young girls and teenagers presenting with pelvic pain. It is a consequence of an underlying adnexal lesion or to anatomical laxity of the suspensory/anchoring ligaments. Clinical symptoms at presentation can be confusing and nonspecific, yet prompt diagnosis and surgical intervention are essential to save the adnexa. Radiology plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of adnexal torsion. Our exhibit will review and promote the rapid MRI as the first line, one-stop imaging in the diagnosis of adnexal torsion and other causes of pelvic pain. Some cases will be presented with initial ultrasound images and demonstrate how MRI increased the confidence in the diagnosis. All presented cases have pathology correlation and or operative reports and follow-up imaging. We will show various cases of ovarian and tubal torsions and their mimickers. In particular, we include torsions due to anatomical laxity of the suspensory ligaments, resulting from tubo-ovarian cysts and solid adnexal masses as well as cases of isolated tubal torsions. Table of Purpose or Case Report: Pelvic and scrotal pain are common emergent presenting symptoms in the pediatric population, and these patients are commonly imaged to evaluated for gonadal torsion. In this educational exhibit we will review the entire spectrum of gonadal and paragonadal torsions in the pediatric population, focusing on clinical presentations, key imaging findings, possible pitfalls in diagnosis, and next steps in management. It is essential for the pediatric radiologist to be familiar with this range of pathology in order to render an accurate and timely diagnosis, particularly given that some (but not all) of these diagnoses require emergent surgery.",

Results: A case-based review of pediatric pelvic (gonadal and paragonadal) torsions covering the entire range of presentation of common entities and classic presentations of rare entities will allow the pediatric radiologist to become more confident and competent in the interpretation of ultrasonography performed for these indications, and well as the interpretation of MRI performed for problem-solving. Conclusions: Suspected gonadal and paragonadal torsions are relatively common indications for imaging, particularly ultrasonography, in the pediatric population.

Feinstein, MD; Radiology, University of Chicago, Chicago , IL Disclosures: All authors have disclosed no financial interests, arrangements or affiliations in the context of this activity. Purpose or Case Report: In this exhibit, we will describe the synergistic effect of urodynamics and imaging. Bladder dysfunction, a common problem in children, accounts for up to 40 percent of pediatric urology clinic visits. Urodynamics is a key study to determine the etiology of bladder dysfunction yet, many radiologists are unfamiliar with this exam. Urodynamics is a fluoroscopic evaluation of the bladder with contrast during which abdominal and bladder pressures are measured while the bladder fills and empties. It uses a combination of electromyogram to evaluate pelvic floor contractions, cystometrogram to evaluate bladder pressures and capacity, and voiding cystourethrography to evaluate lower urinary tract anatomy. This exhibit will explain the indications for urodynamics, the basics of its interpretation including detrusor function and pressure flow studies, and the types of pathologies which may be diagnosed. Neurogenic bladder, congenital abnormalities, and how to differentiate between subsets of overactive bladder and underactive bladder will be explained. We will show imaging findings which correlate with these urodynamic diagnoses and describe ways to enhance voiding cystourethrograms and sonograms to better evaluate children with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Purpose or Case Report: Voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) has long been utilized in the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux in children with urinary tract infections. Sonographic techniques have been developed to make the same diagnosis without exposing the child to ionizing radiation. This presentation describes the implementation steps of a new service including: pharmacy approval and formulary addition; sonographer training and coordination with fluoroscopy technologists; referring clinician education and outreach. This exhibit educates the reader on how ceVUS can be performed, how it can be established at a children's hospital, and the benefits it provides.Correct technique and acquisition of images is shown using clinical case examples. Relevant anatomy is reviewed. Correlation of ultrasound abnormalities with VCUG results is provided. The process of training technologists and radiologists is highlighted. Pitfalls and tips to improve imaging are described. We will present results on how our new service has been accepted and utilized by the urologists and referring physicians.

            "text": "Poster Purpose or Case Report: Background: Image quality in MRI is often degraded by patient motion. To reduce the need for repeat exams, sedation or general anesthesia is used in pediatric patients. This requires additional clinical staff, and leads to increased scheduling wait times and overall procedure times that impact workflow. Many institutions prepare children for MRI using mock-up replicas. While effective in acclimating patients to the MRI environment, the availability of mock-up practices are often limited. Mock-ups also require physical space and do not simulate the full MRI environment and exam experience.Purpose: We build an affordable, scalable, and portable immersive virtual reality (IVR) platform for simulating MRI exams. Specifically, we designed an IVR environment that accurately mimics a Siemens 3 Tesla suite within our Radiology practice, including intricate details such as room size, color, lighting, ancillary equipment, pulse sequence audio, and background noise. The IVR platform also attempts to simulate the complete sequence of events and environments a child will experience during an exam, including the check-in process, interactions with staff (e.g., nurses, technologists), the waiting area and changing rooms, the positioning and motion of the MRI table, placement of coils, and within-exam instructions, such as breath-holds. Our platform also allows the patient to move around in the VR space and interact with the environment. Additionally, the platform can be easily converted to mimic any other MR suite. We hypothesize that our platform can be easily adopted by Child Life and hospital staff to quickly acclimate a patient and assess whether he/she can suitably undergo an MRI exam without sedation or general anesthesia.We believe the IVR platform can overcome the limitations of mock-up replicas. First, IVR has a smaller footprint and is scalable and portable across the hospital. This allows multiple IVR sessions to be held in parallel. Second, IVR can give the patient a hospital-specific and scan-specific first-person experience. The patient can interact with realistic 3D representations of the MRI environment and processes. Our current implementation of IVR was developed using HTC VIVE headsets with a dedicated laptop for control. To further improve portability, the IVR setup can be adopted using simple goggles and handheld devices. This will enable future IVR sessions to be conducted at the bedside, in patient's homes, and in referring physician offices.: Purpose or Case Report: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a robust imaging modality. However, the necessity for patients to hold still commonly requires pediatric patients to be sedated (which carries its own risks), or limits the useful scan time window in some nonsedated pediatric patients. In some circumstances, there is no way to control the movement of the imaging target (i.e. fetal MRI).MRI is also very customizable, and there are number of options currently available to accelerate MR imaging. It is important for pediatric radiologists supervising pediatric MRI examinations to have a broad understanding of the technology that is currently available, in order to optimize imaging quality and mitigate sedation use.In this educational exhibit, we will briefly review a number of acceleration techniques available on the Siemens platform, noting that other vendors have very similar options available for their customers. These techniques will include single-shot fast spin echo , balanced steady-state gradient echo, parallel imaging, radial imaging, and simultaneous multislice imaging. Our review will focus on the relative advantages and disadvantages of these techniques, rather than on the physics of image generation. Purpose or Case Report: Many diseases in pediatrics are relatively uncommon and imaging of these diseases is difficult to study due to small patient numbers at a single site. This limits the ability of single institutions to adequately power a study. Thus, there is a pressing need for a multi-site structure to combine data for rare diseases to appropriately power outcome studies. Our goal is to create an infrastructure to support pooling of imaging and clinical data across institutions to facilitate multi-institutional studies.",

Once IRB approval is obtained, a centralized REDCap, or data entry system, at the primary site will grant access to participating institutions for data entry. Centralized data collection allows all data to be housed in one location, allowing for quicker analysis. For studies requiring imaging transfer, a standard operating procedure (SOP) for image de-identification, naming convention, and image transfer to centralized PACS system should be followed. Results: Our site has established three multi-site clinical imaging trials to date. First, we have an 11-site imaging repository for pleuropulmonary blastoma through the Midwest surgical consortium. All images have been uploaded to our site and pediatric radiologists at three different institutions are viewing de-identified images and inputting data in REDCap.

Nuinersen (Spinraza) was recently approved by FDA for intrathecal administration in SMA patients. Commonly administered by lumbar puncture in the clinic or with imaging guidance, this is the initial method of administering nusinersen. Deformities and spinal instrumentation from orthopedic surgeries are common in SMA patients, preventing traditional intrathecal access by lumbar puncture for nusinersen delivery. Transforaminal lumbar sac access, ultrasound or fluoroscopy guided cervical spine access, or subcutaneous catheter placement can be the alternative approaches with failed/difficult lumbar access.

Within the spectrum of musculoskeletal radiology, ultrasound can be an especially helpful tool in evaluating the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which can often be challenging to assess on other imaging modalities. For instance, ultrasound offers the ability to carefully trace small nerves and easily allows for comparison to the other, often unaffected or normal extremity, as well as dynamic imaging.

Due to its superior axial resolution, ultrasound can better visualize the intra-neural architecture, sometimes better than MRI, especially in the case of small nerves.

Additionally, we as radiologists, can aid our peripheral nerve surgeon colleagues intra-operatively with ultrasound.Some of the hesitance in using the modality may be a reflection of a lack of familiarity on the part of both radiologists and technologists with respect on how to image the PNS and uncertainty about the normal and abnormal appearance of these structures. The objective of this educational exhibit is to provide the knowledge necessary to successfully acquire and interpret ultrasound images of the PNS. The topics addressed in the review will include an introduction on how to appropriately obtain images of the major peripheral nerves, how to distinguish between the normal and abnormal appearance of nerves on ultrasound, and the spectrum of pathology affecting the peripheral nervous system.

While certain superficial soft tissue masses have a classic appearance on ultrasound, others may have a nonspecific appearance and may vary in their sonographic characteristics. This can make a definitive diagnosis and follow-up recommendations difficult, especially for trainees.We aim to provide a basic overview of some of the common and less common superficial soft tissue masses that may be encountered in pediatric imaging, and introduce a novel, structured algorithmic approach for evaluating these lesions on ultrasound.

As the diagnosis is increasingly made during childhood and young adulthood, pediatric radiologists should be familiar with imaging features of Gaucher disease and its complications.Visceromegaly consisting of hepatosplenomegaly is a hallmark of Gaucher disease and uniformly present in cohorts of pediatric patients. In addition, bone marrow involvement with 'Erlenmeyer flasks' have been long recognized as part of this disease, although the classic radiographic finding is not present until adulthood. Marrow involvement confers significant morbidity for these patients with pain, bone infarcts and pathologic fracture.Traditionally, imaging of disease severity has been based on hepatic and splenic visceral organ enlargement and/or qualitative assessment of bone marrow involvement. However, advances in the understanding of Gaucher disease and observations of elevated ferritin levels and increased risk of hepatic fibrosis emphasize the importance of more comprehensive assessment of liver involvement beyond simple enlargement. Moreover, quantitative MRI assessment of bone fat-fractions also may have a role in assessing marrow involvement.

We review multimodal conventional imaging manifestations of Gaucher disease from radiographic manifestations to MRI appearances. Semi-quantitative marrow scoring methods are discussed. This exhibit also discusses newer quantitative approaches to assessment of liver and bone marrow involvement with an emphasis on future applications of advanced methods including spectroscopy, elastography, fatfraction and iron quantification in guiding therapy decisions and monitoring treatment response. Purpose or Case Report: A term \"ciliopathy\" represents a diverse group of genetic disorders caused by mutations in genes coding for components of the primary cilia. Primary cilia have a pivotal biological role in the cell surface of nearly every organ system of the body. \"Skeletal ciliopathy\" is a subset of ciliopathy mainly affecting the skeleton and shares common radiological findings such as short ribs, short limbs, and short digits with or without polydactyly. Pattern recognition approach is thus useful to diagnose skeletal ciliopathy. Skeletal ciliopathy includes (1) Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dysplasia, (2) Ellis-van Creveld syndrome (chondroectodermal dysplasia), (3) Sensenbrenner syndrome (cranioectodermal dysplasia), and (4) Short rib-polydactyly syndromes. Clinically, affected patients commonly present with thoracic hypoplasia with respiratory failure and disproportional stature with a normal trunk and short limbs most severe in the distal segments. Brachydactyly is conspicuous. Patients may have extra-skeletal anomalies such as retinopathy, cardiac anomalies, cerebellar malformations, and hepatorenal failures.Radiological diagnosis of bone dysplasia might be regarded as something complex. We aim to highlight a pattern recognition approach to diagnose skeletal ciliopathies, one of the major bone dysplasias, by providing many cases. We will also review a general concept of \"bone dysplasia family\" which refers to a grouping of radiologically similar skeletal disorders into a \"family.\" This concept has been widely accepted now after we found that phenotypic similarities usually indicate the same/similar pathogenetic mechanisms, and it supports the use of a pattern recognition approach. Imaging diagnosis can guide genetic testing, interpretation, and possibly identify new genes or mutations.",

            "text": "Purpose or Case Report: Proximal humeral epiphyseal fracture-separation is a rare fracture pattern in infants often associated with birth-related or non-accidental trauma, representing a Salter-Harris type I or type II fracture. Lack of a proximal humeral epiphyseal ossification center in most newborns or only subtle displacement of a small epiphyseal ossification center in older infants, makes this injury difficult to diagnose on plain radiographs, potentially leading to delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis. Ultrasound and MRI are therefore useful imaging modalities in indeterminate cases.Clinical findings of infant proximal humeral epiphyseal fractureseparation such as shoulder swelling, tenderness, and decreased active motion, overlap with more common entities including clavicular fracture, brachial plexus injury and osteomyelitis. Radiographs are often the first diagnostic study ordered to evaluate these symptoms but are insensitive due to minimal ossification of the proximal humeral epiphysis. Radiographs may be normal or show subtle displacement of the epiphyseal ossification center, apparent joint space widening, small metaphyseal fracture fragments or displacement of the proximal humeral metaphysis in relation to the scapula. These findings can be misdiagnosed as shoulder dislocation or pseudosubluxation due to a joint effusion. Careful review of the medical record may elucidate a history of difficult delivery with shoulder dystocia or suspected shoulder trauma.Ultrasound and MRI are useful in indeterminate cases due to their ability to resolve the cartilaginous physis and proximal humeral epiphysis, and to resolve their relationship to the humeral shaft and cartilaginous labrum. Ultrasound has higher anatomic resolution and offers the flexibility to quickly image the asymptomatic contralateral shoulder and image in planes that best show the relationship between the non-ossified epiphysis and the humeral shaft. Doppler ultrasound demonstrates epiphyseal perfusion without the need for contrast administration, and serial ultrasound imaging can be used to evaluate healing and remodeling. MRI is more useful in evaluating cases where osteomyelitis and/or septic arthritis are being considered, or in cases of an inconclusive history suspicious for non-accidental trauma to evaluate for additional osseous and soft tissue injuries.Several examples of typical proximal humeral epiphyseal fracture-separations in infants will be presented and the relevant imaging findings discussed. Purpose or Case Report: Background:AVID is an acronym describing a triad of findings including 1) asymmetric ventriculomegaly, 2) interhemispheric cyst, and 3) dysgenesis of the corpus callosum.

However, by focusing attention on the secondary findings, a specific diagnosis may be determined.Objectives:By the end of this presentation the learner will: 1) Become familiar with the imaging characteristics of AVID. 2) Describe the differential diagnosis of AVID and the important distinguishing features. 3) Understand the clinical implications of interhemispheric cysts and similar diagnoses.Cases/Differential Diagnosis:Through several case examples of mistaken diagnoses, we will describe key findings to differentiate brain disorders with midline anomalies including AVID, holoprosencephaly, and aqueductal stenosis. Holoprosencephaly creates a monoventricle, but may also be associated with a dorsal midline cyst which can be confused for an interhemispheric cyst. Features that differentiate holoprosencephaly from AVID are the presence of fused cerebral hemispheres, thalamic fusion, and a true monoventricle. Aqueductal stenosis may also show severe hydrocephalus, but lacks the cystic component which is seen with the other mentioned entities. Aqueduct stenosis usually causes symmetric ventriculomegaly of the lateral and 3rd ventricles as well as upward displacement of anterior cerebral arteries and inferior displacement of internal cerebral veins. The hydrocephalus from all of these entities may be treated with ventricular shunt placement, but AVID is an important diagnosis to consider because the wall of the interhemispheric cyst could be imperceptible by imaging and may not improve if the tip of the drainage catheter is not within the cyst. Conclusion: When evaluating cases of true ventriculomegaly it is important to consider a differential including AVID, holoprosencephaly, aqueductal stenosis, among other less common congenital syndromes. Careful attention to additional imaging findings is necessary to distinguish the correct diagnosis from look-alikes. Making an accurate diagnosis is important as there are differences in medical decision making, treatment outcomes, and long-term prognosis.",

While some of these are also noted in adults, many diseases are specific to the pediatric age group. These can be grouped into infectious/inflammatory, neoplastic, vascular and other miscellaneous disorders.Anatomy of the temporal bone is complex. It forms the lateral aspect of skull base and comprises of five osseous parts viz. squamous, mastoid, petrous, tympanic and styloid segments. Specific disease processes afflict each part of the temporal bone, largely dictated by its anatomy and constituent structures. Hence a structured approach to image interpretation and reporting is especially useful in this region to localise the lesion and subsequently generate differential diagnoses.Traditionally CT has been the imaging modality of choice in assessing temporal bone lesions. However, currently, CT and MRI are deemed complimentary. CT provides exquisite details of anatomy, characterises osseous lesions, determines bony involvement/destruction and extension while MRI is highly useful in assessing intrinsic lesion characteristics due to its superior contrast resolution. In certain aetiologies such as cholesteatoma MRI is diagnostic.This poster aims to review the anatomy of temporal bone and various common, uncommon acquired non traumatic temporal bone lesions in children.The lesions that will be discussed in this poster are listed below:Infectious Purpose or Case Report: PET/MRI has recently become a clinical realization after overcoming complex hardware and image reconstruction issues. The goal of this educational exhibit is to provide a comprehensive, yet understandable, introduction to these aspects of PET/MRI along with displaying a pictorial assay of different normal and abnormal metabolic findings within the field of Pediatric Neuroradiology.The first part of this presentation will begin by highlighting the basic hardware components of the PET/CT contrasting with the interactions between the main components of the PET/MRI scanner along with their associated solutions. In general, these issues include how MRI can affect PET in terms of their magnetic field and RF properties and how PET affect MRI due to the scintillator/electronic components.The second part will begin by discussing some soft tissue and hardware attenuation correction techniques that are currently in use, such as: Segmentation and atlas-based methods along with attenuation map generation and coil localization methods. Additionally, we will show the consequence of field-of-view (FOV) mismatch between the PET and MRI acquisitions and partial volume effects along with their solutions.The final part will showcase clinical applications of PET/MRI to Pediatric Neuroradiology, featuring imaging protocol details and a pictorial guide of normal distributions and pathologic conditions. Clinical examples range from seizure localization, cortical malformations, manifestations of Phakomatoses, perinatal stroke, tumor recurrence, and Flutriciclamide ( 18 F-GE180) imaging in the setting of neuroinflammation. Purpose or Case Report: Dermoid cysts are a sequestration of ectoderm containing secondary skin structures, usually at characteristic locations of embryologic fusion lines. The midventral suprasternal fusion line is one such location in the developing embryo with both simple and complicated dermoids of this region reported in the literature.

Purpose or Case Report: The goal of this educational exhibit is to use a graphical and image heavy Powerpoint presentation to familiarize the reader with the background necessary to understand common clinical ASL-PWI imaging techniques along with displaying a pictorial assay of different normal and abnormal ASL perfusion findings within the field of Pediatric Neuroradiology.To introduce our topic, we will briefly discuss the physiology of cerebral blood flow and how it is measured with and without an exogenous tracer. Next, to serve as an overview, we will show the general ASL experiment, namely, labeling, post label delay, and readout. Following, we will discuss each of the above components, beginning with showing the different main labeling methods, CASL, PCASL, and PASL. Finally, the concept of post label delay will be illustrated respective to each of the main labeling methods.In the second section, we will discuss the image acquisition component by first describing and illustrating two common readout methods, such as 2D-EPI and 3D-GRASE methods along with their advantages and disadvantages. Additionally, we will illustrate the process of background suppression along with its significance. Finally, we will review the process of obtaining perfusion weighted images through the subtraction between tagged and control images.The third section will illustrate an assortment of clinical examples beginning with showing normal physiological hyper-and hypoperfusion and newborn perfusion characteristics.

Although there is a broad spectrum of differentials, the vast majority of these lesions are benign, however malignant etiologies can also be encountered. Ultrasonography has become the first-line imaging modality in the evaluation of neck masses, given the ability to avoid radiation, wide availability and costeffectiveness. Also, ultrasound represents an option when trying to avoid contrast administration or sedation.The main teaching points of this exhibit will be:1.

Early and accurate diagnosis are key to meaningful outcomes and future planning. It is important for neuroradiologists and pediatric radiologists alike to retain a wide range of differential diagnoses thus providing diagnostic confidence when potential future cases are encountered. Purpose or Case Report: The purpose of this exhibit is explore pitfalls in our experience with SPECT-CT Iodine-123 (I-123) MIBG imaging in patients with neuroblastoma. SPECT-CT can more specifically localize areas of uptake over planar imaging and mitigate false-positive results with correlative anatomic information. We will review cases of false-positive MIBG uptake in nonmalignant sites, cases of false-negative MIBG uptake in neuroblastoma/neural crest tumors, and cases of secondary tumors/malignancies occurring in the setting of known neuroblastoma, with variable uptake on MIBG. Purpose or Case Report: With the increased demand and utilization of PET/MRI in oncologic imaging, there is an ever increasing database of non-malignant pathology that has not yet been described on PET/MRI. Furthermore, the pediatric population provides an even more unique breadth of pathology that is often only seen in this age group. It is important to be able to accurately identify these common pathologies so as to not mistake them for malignancy and to prevent unnecessary follow up imaging studies and further invasive diagnostic procedures.For this educational exhibit we review over 200 clinical pediatric 18F-FDG PET/MRs performed at our institution and highlight the most common and most interesting cases of FDG-avid non-malignant pathology.Listed below are some of the cases to be included in the poster:-Benign FDG avid bone tumors including non-ossifying fibromas-Benign causes of FDG avid lymphadenopathy including cat scratch disease-Benign causes of FDG avid lung lesions including aspiration pneumonia-Benign causes of gastro-intestinal FDG uptake including pseudomembranous colitis-Benign FDG avid infectious pathologies including a liver abscess Purpose or Case Report: Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disease (PTLD) is a polyclonal and monoclonal lymphoid proliferation which occurs in 1-20% of solid organ transplant recipients. It is most common in multivisceral organ transplants followed by small bowel transplants, heart and lung transplants and less commonly in liver and kidney transplants. PTLD has a bimodal distribution of occurrence with the largest peak occurring within 1 year after transplantation and a second peak at approximately 4-5 years after transplantation. The Epstein Barr virus (EBV) is associated in 50-70% of cases. EBV seronegativity in the recipient at the time of transplant predicts a 2-4 times increased risk of PTLD especially if they receive a donor organ which is positive for EBV. This may explain the higher incidence in the pediatric population who tend to be seronegative for EBV. The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies four pathologic categories of PTLD: early lesions, polymorphic type, monomorphic type and classic Hodgkins lymphoma. The majority of PTLD cases are caused by Blymphocyte proliferation in a T-cell depleted environment in the setting of immunosuppression. However, there is a subset of cases that are caused by T-cell or natural killer cells as well as cases that occur in the setting of negative EBV. Multiple clones of proliferating B-cells can be seen in a single patient. 2/3 of cases have diffuse expression of CD20 which is an important target for therapy.PTLD may be focal or diffuse and can manifest in a variety of different organ systems or even in the allograft itself. There is a higher percentage of extranodal disease in PTLD as compared to immunocompetent patients with lymphoma. The GI tract and liver are most commonly involved. Isolated lymph node involvement in comparison is less common in patients with PTLD. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement is relatively rare in PTLD.This educational exhibit will provide a pictorial review of PTLD and illustrates cases from one of the busiest transplant centers in North America to highlight the major imaging findings as well as complications seen on imaging of this disease. Extranodal and nodal disease will be demonstrated on multiple modalities as well as complications of this disease including intussusception and biliary obstruction. CNS disease will also be shown. The clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, prognosis and treatment will be discussed and depicted.",

Messenger RNA is the intermediary between the genetic information encoded by DNA and the proteins and enzymes that eventually produce phenotypes. The DICER1 product thus serves as a policeman of sorts, and common DICER1 mutations result in a dysfunction and loss of regulation which increases the likelihood that a neoplastic process will ensue. Most individuals with a DICER1 mutation do not develop cancer, but the risk is increased. Pleuropulmonary blastoma is a primary concern in DICER1 syndrome. Cystic nephroma is also a common association. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors and multinodular goiter are seen in patients with DICER1syndrome. Pineoblastoma and pituitary blastoma are seen with specific DICER1 abnormalities. Conclusions: DICER1 syndrome is a cancer predisposition condition that can affect multiple organ systems. Understanding the function of this gene is essential to appreciating its associated disease processes. Purpose or Case Report: PET/MR is a valuable and growing imaging method for the assessment and management of pediatric bone tumors. Although plain radiography remains the first line modality for initial evaluation, cross sectional imaging is often required for further characterization of indeterminate or aggressive appearing lesions. Due to its superior soft tissue contrast resolution compared to CT, MR has become the mainstay in tissue characterization, locoregional staging, and surgical planning of pediatric bone tumors. By adding functional and metabolic information, FDG-PET imaging is useful for \"one stop\" local tumor and whole-body staging, evaluating response to therapy and surveillance. 18F-FDG PET/MR scans have the benefit of lower radiation and increased patient convenience compared to 18F-FDG PET/CT scans. However, due to the relatively recent development of this technology, many radiologists may be unfamiliar with the technical considerations and interpretation pearls and pitfalls of PET/MR. This educational exhibit reviews the imaging technique, reporting requirements, and imaging characteristics of the most common pediatric bone tumors with 18F-FDG PET/MR.",

The consensus of chief residents was that a 4-part lecture series delivered by a pediatric radiologist would be beneficial to pediatric residents. Topics included general radiation risk as well as basic imaging topics in the chest, abdomen, neurologic system, extremities, and vasculature. Each lecture integrated appropriate ordering, ALARA/Image Gently, and basic image interpretation. Pediatric residents were given a 10-item quiz before and after the lecture series assessing their knowledge regarding the best test to order in clinical scenarios. Residents were also asked, using a Likert scale, to rate their understanding of radiation risk, the ACR Appropriateness Criteria, and other topics of interest before and after each lecture. There was no correlation between PRF and RV strain but RV end diastolic volume (RV EDVi) and stroke volume(RVSVi). Duration time had obvious negative correlation with LVEF but positive correlation with RV EDVi and RV end systolic volume (RV ESVi). Each segment radial and circumferential strain had obvious correlation. Conclusions: Pulmonary regurgitation fraction will cause right ventricular volume overload and ventricular deformation. RV strain was not found to have correlation with right ventricular volume overload and ventricular deformation in this small group study, but more cases need to be enrolled and control group should be include to compare which will be continued to study.

Results: A total of 32 cases of CCTA were performed in our hospital from January 2016 to May 2018 (from 0.5 to 30 years of age; median 12). Indications for CCTA include 1) congenital coronary anomalies (n = 12), 2) after arterial switch operation (n = 10), 3) other congenital heart disease (n = 6), and 4) miscellaneous (n = 4). All patients had a diagnostic echocardiogram. Although a few, initial studies were performed on a 64 slice scanner, most of the studies were performed using a 2 x 128 slice dual source scanner. High-pitch, prospectively gated, adaptive, prospectively gated, and dose modulated, retrospectively gated techniques were utilized depending upon the patients' heart rhythms. Exposure parameters, kilovolt peak (kVp) and milliampere-seconds (mAs) were adjusted according to patient size and body habitus, as well as due to the presence of metallic chest implants. Three had suboptimal CT images due to an ectopic beat (1), hiccups (1), and a limited injection rate (1). Twenty nine cases (91%) showed expected diagnostic quality: 97% for coronary ostia and 91% for distal segments, superior to echocardiogram. Average/median radiation dose was 2.83/1.97 mSv, which was improved in 2018 (1.53/1.62 mSv) after protocol revision. Conclusions: Coronary CTA provides more reliable image quality of the coronary ostia and distal segments than echocardiogram and delineates a distinct spatial relationship with extravascular structures that angiography cannot. The radiation dosage has been significantly reduced with proactive heart rate control by pre-and intra-procedural use of betablockers, as well as implementation of aggressive protocol dose reduction techniques. CCTA is a reliable and safe diagnostic modality in analyzing coronary anatomy in children. Purpose or Case Report: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a myopathy with a natural history of progressive cardiomyopathy and vasogenic edema, fatty infiltration, and myocardial fibrosis. We recently identified a group of patients with DMD who presented with acute onset of chest pain (ACP), troponin leak (TL), and new late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), similar in presentation to acute viral myocarditis (AM). It is unclear if these patients have suffered an episode of AM or if this is a different disease process.

Regional differences were identified in the native T1 maps, particularly in the inferior segment. Conclusions: Patients with DMD who present with ACP, TL, and new LGE have increased T1 values compared to asymptomatic DMD patients, and similar to patients with AM. Increased signal is particularly noted in the inferior and anterior segments. However their T2 values are similar to the asymptomatic DMD patients and lower than AM patients. Although the presentation and clinical course of the DMD patients with ACP and TL has many similarities to AM, the T2 values suggest a lack of significant myocardial edema. This may represent a unique and unusual disease process in the natural history of DMD. Conclusions: Utilizing one of the largest reported series, this advanced imaging series of omphalocele demonstrates the value of organ-specific characterization to prognostication. While identifying liver position has long been recognized as valuable in predicting outcome, our analysis found predictive value for spleen and stomach position as well. These markers should be examined in a larger patient cohort with the goal of creating a validated set of prognostic imaging biomarkers.",

NLV was normalized against published lung volumes by gestational age (O/E NLV). Imaging parameters were correlated with respiratory outcomes at birth including respiratory symptoms at birth, need for oxygen supplementation, mechanical ventilation, and delay in feeding. Purpose or Case Report: Fetal CT has almost the same utility as a postnatal skeletal survey. Despite this benefit, the associated radiation exposure is disadvantageous and radiation dose reduction is mandatory. It is however impossible to measure the actual radiation dose to the fetus directly. Several previous reports have described the CT dose index (CTDI) volume and dose length product (DLP) as representing an imagined fetal dose. The actual fetal radiation dose needs to be confirmed using a phantom that practically corresponds to a pregnant woman.",

It could contained three artificial fetal skeletons with different densities of calcium fluoride (300 HU: 1.90 mol/L, 500 HU: 3.63 mol/L, 700 HU: 5.37 mol/L). Dose measurements were obtained using four CT scanners (GE, TOSHIBA, SIEMENS, PHILIPS) at three different institutions with the same scan parameters (CTDIvol: 3.0 mGy; tube voltage: 80, 100, 120 kV) at four measurement points (distance from skin surface: 4 cm, 7 cm, 10 cm, and center). We compared the radiation dose for each tube voltage, at the different measurement points. The differences in dose between CTDIvol and measured data were assessed. Results: The mean measured dose was 2.3 mGy at the center, and 3.73 mGy, 4 cm from the skin surface, across all vendors and tube voltages, corresponding to doses between 76% and 124% of the displayed CTDIvol (3 mGy). The maximum deviation was 1.58 fold (at 120 kV, distance from skin surface: 4 cm). Doses in the peripheral part of the pelvis showed 1.5-1.8 fold greater exposure in comparison with the central position. Doses increased in proportion to tube voltage settings and mean doses at 120 kV were 1.03-1.18 fold greater than at 80 kV. There were discrepancies in the measured dose among four CT scanners that ranged from 61 to 120% (around the mean of 120 kV). Conclusions: Fetuses undergoing CT for suspected skeletal dysplasia may be exposed to approximately 0.8-1.2 times the displayed CTDIvol on the CT console. We suggest that the CTDIvol roughly represents fetal dose. There is however heterogeneity and the wide range of fetal doses depends on the position of the fetus, the selection of tube voltage, and CT units.",

Cerebral blood flow measures (RI, TAMx) in anterior cerebral (ACA), middle cerebral (MCA) and basilar (BA) arteries were correlated with MRS ratios of neuronal health (Nacetylaspartate, NAA) in the basal ganglia (BG) and frontal white matter (WM).

Results: As resistance in MCA increased above normal (Q3), NAA ratios in WM decreased (r 2 = -0.574, p=0.02), reflecting a decrease in neuronal integrity. Also, as blood flow velocity in BA (Q4) increased above normal, NAA ratios decreased in BG (r 2 = -0.550, p =0.012).

In previous, unpublished research, the authors identified several imaging findings associated with a significantly decreased success rate of therapeutic enema, including presence of bowel obstruction on plain film, trapped fluid and poor blood flow on ultrasound, and location of the leading edge of the intussusception at or beyond the splenic flexure. A scoring system was devised assigning 1 point to each of these findings. This scoring system was then retrospectively applied to the cases of ileocolic intussusception at our institution between September 2012 -August 2017 in which plain films and ultrasounds were both available. The cases were then stratified according to their scores, and correlated with enema results and surgical outcomes. Complicated surgical cases were defined as those that required more extensive surgery than a standard laparoscopic reduction, such as conversion to open laparotomy. Results: 191 cases were reviewed. Following point assignment, the following categories were generated: Category 0 (114 cases), Category 1 (35 cases), Category 2 (32 cases), Category 3 (8 cases), and Category 4 (2 cases). Category 0 had the highest enema success rate (86%) and lowest rates of complicated surgery (3%) and bowel resection (3%). Lower rates of enema success, and higher rates of complicated surgery and bowel resection, were seen in higher categories. In grouped analysis, there was a statistically significant decrease in enema success rate between Categories 0-1 and Categories 2-4 (83% vs 19%, p < 0.0001), and increase in complicated surgeries (4% vs 40%, p < 0.0001) and bowel resections (3% vs 29%, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: A simple scoring system based on imaging findings obtained in most cases of ileocolic intussusception can predict reducibility by therapeutic enema, as well as surgical outcomes in cases of failed reductions. This information can be useful to radiologists, surgeons, and emergency physicians when determining patient management, as some patients may be better served by proceeding to surgery rather than enema. Further research to validate the scoring system in a prospective fashion is planned. Purpose or Case Report: Determine if the length of time between diagnosis of an intussusception and therapeutic enema, or reported length of symptoms, is associated with lower enema success rates or higher rates of complicated surgery and bowel resection.",

The radiology information system at our institution was queried for the keyword \"intussusception\" in fluoroscopic reports from September 2012 -August 2017. The length of time (\"time to catheter\") between diagnosis of intussusception, defined as the end time stamp of the ultrasound or CT on which it was first identified, and the start of therapeutic enema, defined as the first time stamp on images from the enema, was then calculated. In addition, the medical record was reviewed for overall length of symptoms (LOS) as documented in the emergency department note. Correlation with enema results, and surgical outcomes in patients failing reduction, was then performed. Complicated surgical cases were defined as those that required more extensive surgery than a standard laparoscopic reduction, such as conversion to open laparotomy. Results: 209 cases were reviewed. There were 148 successful enemas and 61 failures. No significant difference was found in mean overall LOS between the 2 groups (1.44 days vs 1.58 days, p = 0.44) or in mean \"time to catheter\" (1 hour 53 minutes vs 1 hour 54 minutes, p = 0.3). Using grouped analysis, in patients with \"time to catheter\" of 0 -4 hours versus those > 4 hours, no significant difference was identified in enema success rates (71% vs 65%, p = 0.6), rates of complicated surgery (11% vs 12%, p = 0.9), or rates of bowel resection (8% vs 12%, p = 0.56). Similarly, there was no significant difference among groups with the shortest and longest LOS. In patients with LOS 0 -1 days versus those > 2 days, enema success rates (73% vs 68%, p = 0.5), complicated surgery rates (9% vs 15%, p = 0.25), and bowel resection rates (6% vs 13%, p = 0.14) were not significantly different. Conclusions: Air enemas for intussusception performed within 4 hours of diagnosis did not show a difference in rates of enema success, complicated surgery, or bowel resection compared to those performed greater than 4 hours after diagnosis. Additionally, overall length of symptoms does not show a difference in rates. Putty\u00ae (Ja-Ru), polyvinyl acetate in water (Elmer's\u00ae glue), support material in water (Support 705\u00ae, Connex 500) and Metamucil\u00ae in water were tied-off into nitrile gloves separately. These were placed individually into the central lumen of the synthetic bowel in a tub of water and a sonographer with 17 years experience scanned the bowel using a Philips EpiQ-7G to evaluate the sonographic characteristics. Microbubbles (Lumason\u00ae, Bracco Diagnostics Inc) were then injected into the false lumen and rescanned. A numerical grading system was developed ranging from 4 to 12 to determine the optimal material. The criteria assessed on US included: visualization and imaging quality of the bowel wall(s), \u00b1 sonographic artifact and presence of echogenicity on B-mode and signal intensity on contrast mode. The luminal material with the highest score was deemed the optimal material. Results: Materials ranged from a score of 6 to 12. The Play-Doh\u00ae, support material and Elmer's\u00ae glue each had the lowest scores of 6 due to poor image quality, extensive artifact and poor visualization of the bowel walls and Lumason\u00ae on contrast mode. The Kinetic Sand\u2122 had a score of 7 and was better at visualizing the lateral bowel wall. The Metamucil\u00ae and Flarp Putty\u00ae had scores of 8 and 9 respectively, with complete visualization of the bowel wall and little artifact but both materials had increased echogenicity on B-mode. Play-Doh\u00ae in water and Kinetic Sand\u2122 in water had the highest scores, 12 and 11 respectively. These materials demonstrated no artifact from luminal content with optimal image quality of the bowel wall. Yet, the Play-Doh\u00ae in water scored the highest due to best Lumason\u00ae visualization in the bowel wall.",

Of these 87 patients, 27 patients were excluded as no tubes were placed. For the remaining patients (N=61), ETT, NGT and IOT placement was assessed using a combination of radiographs and multiplanar CT, and characterized as \"satisfactory position\" or \"malpositioned\". For the malpostioned devices, the exact location was also documented. Results: Of the 45 patients with an ETT, the tube was in satisfactory position in 9 (20%) patients and malpositioned in 36 (80%) patients. Of the malpositioned tubes, 5 were at the carina, 20 in the right main bronchus, 9 in the esophagus and 5 in other locations (at T2, T4, nasopharynx, etc.). The NGT was in satisfactory position in 13 (76%) patients and malpositioned in 4 (24%) patients, with tubes in the pharynx (two cases) and distal esophagus (2 cases). Of the 58 IOTs inserted, 15 (26%) were in satisfactory position and 43 (74%) were malpositioned, including 10 that had been completely removed but with CT evidence of prior incorrect positioning, 8 were through and through bone and 6 in the superficial soft tissues. Conclusions: Malpositioning of the ETT, NGT and IOTs in this study is likely multifactorial. Tube placement is less common in the pediatric emergency setting compared to adult medicine, possibly resulting in decreased experience and comfort level among pediatric EHS teams. There may be a role for further specialized training, with more frequent recertification. Use of a laryngeal airway mask could also be considered as an alternative to ETT in pediatric patients with difficult airways. The results of study will help to inform future training of pediatric EHS teams at our institution, with ongoing review of post-mortem imaging as a means of quality assurance. ",

Results: Data analysis revealed three thematic categories: (1) Common Influences on the Decision Process (these include patient factors, PEDP's experience, the specialist perspective, and logistics), (2) Radiology Consultation Experience, (3) PEDP Perspectives on ICDSS which includes perspectives on how implementation of an ICDS system at our institution may impact practice. PEDP's described consultation as a valuable component of ICDS but reported difficulty in coordinating an imaging strategy with radiologists and other physician consultants. PEDP's described the exchange of ideas as especially worthwhile for clinical scenarios that do not fit neatly into ICDS pathways. Significant barriers to radiologist consultation included: time, access to radiology attendings, limited confidence in trainees, and not wanting to disrupt radiologist workflow. PEDP's expressed a belief that ICDSS could potentially improve their workflow and augment effective interaction with the radiology department. Conclusions: PEDP's predict that radiologist consultation will continue to be an essential component of ICDS following the implementation of ICDSS. These results present an opportunity for radiologists to improve in-person radiologist consultation in clinical and didactic settings.

The first survey, administered at the inception of our pilot period, was applied towards the numerical scoring system.

Results: 16 out of 20 radiologists in our group responded to both surveys. Overall satisfaction was slightly higher (weighted average of 3.64 versus 3.5) for the scoreless peer review compared to the numerical scoring system. Our colleagues felt more likely to underreport while reviewing a case with the numerical system as compared to the scoreless one. Reported negative emotional impact from discordances was slightly higher with the scoring system. Radiologists felt more inclined to provide a comment for educational purposes when agreeing with the interpretation while using the scoreless system. Comments were felt to be important in both systems. Conclusions: A scoreless comments-only peer review system shows promise in providing more educational opportunities than a comment-enhanced numerical system, with less negative emotional impact on participant radiologists. This benefit may be even greater in practices in which radiologists are prone to underscore their colleagues.

Results: Silicone was the chosen material poured into 3D printed molds with break-away and dissolvable internal cavities to create the anatomic vein and atrial system. The phantom design was also divided into three main regions of interest: chest, neck, and thigh. Rubber tube connections between the regions and pumps allowed for circulatory flow.The design process of the phantom consisted of incorporating several 15year-old patient CTA exams to create the atrial and venous pathways. The pathways were then aligned with regions (chest, neck, thigh) segmented from CT exams in MaterialiseMimics and3-Matic. Connection ports between regions were added. Access points covered with a replaceable \"skin patch\" were added to the neck and thigh regions for reusability. The mold and breakaway cavities were 3D printed on a StratasysFortus450mcin ABS plastic. Smooth-On Ecoflex30was selected for molding to simulate the body and DragonSkin10for the skin patch based off the ShoreValue.Phantom feasibilityfor fluoroscopic visibility, contrast visibility, angiography, venography and device placement and removal was assessed and was successful in this prototype. Conclusions: Phantom creation for pediatric interventional radiology simulation and training is an exciting prospect in pediatric IR for complex and/uncommonly performed procedures both for attending staff skill maintenance and initial training for fellows and residents. Going forward subsections of this phantom will be removable for repeat procedures such as stent placement.

Results: A total of 11 ABCs in 11 patients (average age = 13.4 yrs; range: 8-17) were treated with 22 total procedures (range: 1-4 treatments/patient). 7/11 (63.6%) ABCs presented with recurrence following surgical resection. ABC location included spine 3/11 (27.3%), pelvis 4/11 (36.4%), lower extremity 2/11 (18.1%), humerus 1/11 (9.1%), and rib 1/11 (9.1%). Doxycycline sclerotherapy alone was used in 10 procedures in 4 (36.4%) patients, cryoablation alone was used in 7 procedures in 4 (36.4%) patients, and a combination of percutaneous ablation and doxycycline was used in 5 procedures in 3 patients (27.3%). All 22 (100%) procedures were technically successful. Clinically, 10/11 (91%) showed clinical improvement including cessation of pain and improved range of motion. Mean followup time= 9 months (range: 1-20 months). On imaging, 9/10 (90%) ABCs decreased in size with increasing sclerosis on follow-up imaging. 1/10 (10%) ABC did not respond to percutaneous treatment and required repeat surgical resection. One patient is awaiting imaging follow-up. 1/11 (9.1%) patient experienced a major complication of left lower-extremity paralysis, bowel incontinence, and fecal incontinence following treatment of an L4 ABC that resolved. 1/11 (9.1%) patient experienced a minor complication of transient numbness of the lateral thigh. Conclusions: Percutaneous treatment of ABCs is a safe and efficacious treatment option in the pediatric and adolescent population.",

Clinical and imaging follow up with MRI occurred at 3, 6, and 12 months. Results: Common imaging findings after cryoablation include resolution of fluid-fluid levels, decreased size of a T2hyperintense core, appearance of a sclerotic rim of bone, and a cryoablation burn zone. All patients reported markedly decreased pain and return to normal activity by 6 months post treatment, including one patient able to play a full hockey game at 3 months. No major complications were reported. No clinical or imaging indicators were present to suggest recurrence. Conclusions: ABCs are a difficult entity to treat with high recurrence rates and morbidity with current treatment options. After percutaneous cryoablation, ABCs may show common imaging findings which may help radiologists monitor treatment efficacy. All three patients treated at our institution showed excellent clinical results. Percutaneous cryoablation is a promising treatment modality for ABCs which in our series confers exceptional benefit to patient symptomatology without serious morbidity. Purpose or Case Report: Acoustic radiation force imaging (ARFI) is a type of quantitative sonoelastography (SE) that has been used to determine tissue stiffness in many disorders including liver fibrosis, breast cancer, thyroid nodules and more recently, cutaneous scleroderma.

Infections were established using a combination of positive cultures, elevated inflammatory markers, clinical assessment, and response to antibiotic treatment. MR studies were retrospectively reviewed by 2 radiologists in consensus for the presence of bone marrow edema, bony erosions, joint effusion, extracapsular edema, soft tissue abscess, and sciatic neuritis. Pre-treatment radiography was reviewed for the presence of radiographically visible osseous change. Clinical chart review was performed for clinical history and outcomes. Descriptive data is presented as mean \u00b1 SD. The inter-observer agreement was evaluated with weighted-kappa. Kappa scores (k) of 0.41-0.60, 0.61-0.80 and \u22650.80 were regarded to be indicative of interest (ROI) are created.The CT and MRI sequences are fused using the image registration algorithms in MIMICS TM .VSP and creation of patient specific surgical guides:The registered 3D models are imported into Geomagic Freeform (3D systems,SC,USA).The program has a force feedback haptic phantom and tools for cutting, moving, rotating, and creation of offsets, etc. Resection(osteotomy)planes are created on the model after due consideration of the safety margin required for the type of tumor,blood vessels in the line of osteotomy, preservation of musculoskeletal function, and any other clinical requirements of the surgeon.The planes are then used to cut the models, simulating the surgical procedure.Open type or closed guides are created depending on the anatomical location,tumor type,surgical plan and surgeon's preferences.Guides are designed as an offset of the remaining normal bone along the osteotomy plan. Screw holes for fixing the guide to the anatomical region of resection are provided.Bone thickness in the ROI is provided ahead of surgery for appropriate planning and preparedness.3D Printing:Designed guides are 3D printed with autoclavable materials such as DentalSG\u2122resin,ULTEM 9085, and Polyamide or with MED610-Sterrad sterilization.Patient specific surgical guides so produced are used in the sterile field and fitted on the ROI.The VSP resection plan is transferred to the OR and executed precisely.

We have observed subtle loss of the normal low signal intensity line of the zone of provisional calcification (ZPC) extending beyond areas of physeal bar formation in some patients with prior growth plate fractures. This loss is a marker of disrupted endochondral ossification and likely reflects a more extensive region of physeal damage that might be used to better predict treatment outcomes.

Signal maps demonstrated visually detectable differences that correlate with loss of the ZPC surrounding the physeal bridge versus normal radius and ulna. Conclusions: Quantifiable changes in the ZPC can be demonstrated with this model. The model will be applied to MRI's in patients with prior growth plate fractures and compared with clinical outcomes to determine its utility in providing a more complete assessment of physeal function. Purpose or Case Report: MRI interpretation of pediatric bone marrow is a challenging task due to the highly variable appearance. The bone marrow composition, especially the cellularity, changes with age, benign and malignant hematologic conditions, medications, among other etiologies. Detection of a marrow replacement process on MRI can be missed even by experienced radiologists. Normal hematopoietic bone marrow from birth to 9 years ranges from 20-40% fat (inversely related to cellularity). In malignant marrow replacement processes such as leukemia, bone marrow is highly cellular and fat percentage is low. Currently, no technique is routinely used in clinical practice to quantify bone marrow fat percentage on MRI.",

Bone marrow biopsy fat % was averaged between two blinded pathologists. MRI obtained from the suspected area of symptoms and core bone marrow biopsy obtained (as standard of clinical care) from the iliac crest. The MRI technique used was the Dixon technique with fat and water separation. Fat fraction is calculated based on the ratio of fat and water proton density. MRI was considered predictive of malignancy if fat fraction % was less than 20. Results: Six cases of patients (mean age 7.5y (range 3-14y)) were recruited. Pathologic diagnoses included: leukemia (n=5) or rhabdomyosarcoma (n=1). MRI was performed and analyzed from the: pelvis (n=4), spine (n=1), and elbow (n=1). MRI fat% correlated with pathology, but due to the small sample size was not significant (r=0.6, p=.20). Inter-pathologist correlation was high (r= 0.9, p<0.05). Elbow MRI fat% correlated with pathology (76 v. 67.5%), but was falsely negative in predicting leukemia. Of all other locations, mean fat percentage calculated by MRI versus pathology was similar (average\u00b1 standard deviation, 3.7\u00b1 1.3 v 3.0\u00b1 3.0). Conclusions: MRI can help radiologists detect a malignant marrow replacement process with more confidence using the fat fraction technique. Studies are ongoing to compare these cases to control patients. differences in seizure duration and seizure types among the three groups. Conclusions: Patients with concordant distribution of the findings between SWI and EEG had significantly frequent multiple or epileptic seizures. SWI may be helpful to discover the epileptic focus localization in children with acute seizures.

Bone marrow transplant patients were excluded. All children were oncology patients undergoing treatment. Control groups used include 18 consecutive patients at hospital A and 18 consecutive patients at hospital B who presented to the ED requiring CT of the face. Control patients with a history of sinusitis, patients with a facial bone fracture, and patients with any oronasal support devices were excluded. No exams of neutropenic fever patients at hospital B were available, hospital B uses nasal endoscopy to assess for sinus disease in this population. Lund-Mackay (L-M) and modified Lund-Mackay scores were applied to all CT scans. Results: The mean age in the neutropenic fever group was 9.86 years. The mean ages of hospital A and B control groups were 8.16 and 8.34 years, respectively. Age differences were not significantly different using a Student t-test. LM scores in the hospital A control group exhibited a mean of 5.50 with a mean modified-LM score of 6.92. Corresponding values in the hospital B control group were 3.11 and 4.00, respectively. In the neutropenic fever group of hospital A, the mean LM and modified-LM scores were 4.17 and 4.59, respectively. Findings viewed as \"positive\" in the neutropenic fever group resulted in 2 infectious disease and 2 ENT consults. All 4 consults concluded that fever was unlikely to be due to paranasal sinus disease, no intervention recommended. Conclusions: Mucosal sinus thickening is omnipresent in children and can vary based on region. Baseline paranasal sinus mucosal thickening is greater among children living in a desert climate. The description of paranasal sinus mucosal thickening in neutropenic children may be of little value in the approach to fever without source.

Results: On FLAIR images, median (25 th percentile, 75 th percentile) CNR and conspicuity for FCD was 11.3 (8.5, 20.9) and 10.2 (7.1, 15.4), significantly higher than corresponding CNR of 1.0 (-0.2, 5.5) and conspicuity of 0.8 (-0.2, 2.8) for controls (p<0.0001 for both). Similarly, CNR and conspicuity for FCD was also higher than controls on T1WI (p<0.0001). Subgroup analysis showed that these differences from normal were maintained irrespective of FCD detection or lack thereof at the initial review. Median CNR and conspicuity on FLAIR (p = 0.79 and 0.07 respectively) and T1WI (p = 0.64 and 0.76 respectively) were not significantly different for FCD cases that were detected and those that were missed on the initial review. Conclusions: Focal cortical dysplasia lesions have significantly higher CNR and conspicuity relative to mirror-location gray matter when compared to age and sex matched controls.

Brain models help surgeons to educate the patients, parents, residents and fellows to understand neuroanatomy better.Parents understand the clinical situation and suggested treatment implications better and give better informed consent. Purpose or Case Report: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven to be valuable in the fields of image processing and computer vision. Our work applies complexvalued CNNs to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to reduce scan times. The reduction of scan times has widespread pediatric benefits. A typical scan requires that patients remain still for up to an hour to produce a clear image, which is difficult for children without inducing anesthesia, which carries risks. A need exists for greatly improved MRI scan times without the loss of diagnostic accuracy. This scan time can be reduced by subsampling in k-space. We use CNNs to reconstruct images from these undersampled acquisitions. Our work investigates complex-valued CNNs for image reconstruction in lieu of two-channel real-valued CNNs.",

            "text": "Recent work suggests complex-valued CNNs could be more accurate than real-valued CNNs when dealing with complex-valued data. Typically, complex-valued data is fed into CNNs by using a 2-channel architecture where the channels contain the real and imaginary components of the data. This does not preserve phase information, which is valuable for many MRI applications. Recent work in applying complex-valued CNNs to music transcription and speech prediction tasks demonstrates complex-valued models are highly competitive with their real two-channel counterparts (Trabelsi et al., 2018) . Complex-valued neural networks have been applied to MRI fingerprinting with improvements in accuracy in comparison to real models (Virtue et al., 2017) .We apply complex-valued CNNs to subsampled image reconstruction by modifying components of our current CNN within our deep unrolled architecture to be complex-valued. We perform complex convolution and explore various complexvalued activation functions which keep the pre-activated phase intact, as well as activation functions which are based on the phase component. We evaluate the performance in terms of accuracy of this complex model compared to its real counterpart. Results: We trained two otherwise identical CNNs with realvalued convolution and complex-valued convolution, and approximately 900K trainable parameters each. The validation loss was 0.693 and 0.639, respectively. This shows complexvalued networks have the potential to be much more accurate than their real-valued counterparts. Conclusions: Our work shows potential for reducing MRI scan times by more accurately reconstructing images from subsampled data acquisitions using complex-valued CNNs.

The distribution and number of LCH lesions on both skeletal survey and PET-CT were documented from our institution's PACS. Any reports with insufficient information or ambiguity were re-evaluated by a Pediatric Radiologist. Demographic information was recorded and the concordance between lesions seen on the skeletal survey and/or PET-CT scan was calculated. Results: Data from 10 children (60% female) with a median age of 4.6 years (range from 1 year 7 months to 15 years, 1 month) are reported. A total of 53 lesions in 40 different bones were evaluated. Forty-nine per cent of all lesions were identified on both PET-CT and skeletal survey. PET-CT identified an additional 34% of lesions not seen on skeletal survey, while skeletal survey identified 17% of lesions not seen on PET-CT. There were 9 calvarial lesions, all identified on skeletal survey while only 4/9 were identified on PET-CT scan. The median interval between the skeletal survey and PET-CT scan was 2.5 days (1-15 days). Conclusions: Skeletal survey continues to be important in the evaluation of LCH patients, especially when assessing lesions involving the calvarium. This may, in part, be due to the thickness of the PET-CT slices reducing lesion conspicuity and the marked avidity of the brain parenchyma on PET-CT obscuring lesions within the calvarium.",

Added value of the co-registered CT was categorized as providing: increased sensitivity, improved localization, improved tumour delineation, improved differentiation between malignant and physiological or benign findings, detection of additional incidental findings, and/or no additional value when fused with the I-123 mIBG scintigraphy. Chi-square tests were performed to assess differences between diagnosis vs follow-up scans with added value from the co-registered CT. Curie score evaluation was performed using planar and SPECT/CT imaging. Results: Of all assessed scans, 70% of co-registered contrastenhanced diagnostic CT studies performed as part of the SPECT/CT scan provided added value (87% of staging scans at diagnosis (n=47), 67% in follow-up (n=337)). Overall, use of co-registered CT enhanced diagnostic sensitivity, tumour localization and delineation, and differentiation of malignant versus benign findings in many cases, and also identified additional incidental findings. Curie score assessment was improved in areas of equivocal lesions involving mainly the torso and particularly on follow-up examinations.

An experienced pediatric radiologist blinded to the clinical data recorded abnormalities including peribronchial thickening, adenopathy, pleural effusion, and pulmonary opacities (characterized as band-like, streaky, consolidative, round or other). Clinical and laboratory data were collected including length of hospitalization (LOS), days of respiratory support (DOS), days of fever (DOF), blood culture, CBC, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and nasopharyneal/oropharyngeal swabs for viral and bacterial pathogen detection, and whole blood for transcriptional analysis and MDTH calculation. We used chest radiographic findings to classify patients according to clinical variables and the genomic MDTH score. We performed two-tailed unpaired t-test to compare groups stratified by radiological findings. Results: 144 chest radiographs were reviewed. Patients with pleural effusion (right or left) (n=43, 30%) showed significantly longer LOS, DOS, DOF, CRP and higher MDTH scores (all p <0.05) compared with those patients without pleural effusion (n=101). Likewise, patients with consolidative opacity (air space opacity) (n=82, 57%) showed significantly longer LOS, DOF, and higher MDTH scores (all p <0.05) compared with those patients without a consolidative opacity (n=62). Conclusions: In a cohort of children hospitalized with CAP, we identified chest radiographic findings that classified patients according to: 1) clinical markers of disease severity and 2) the MDTH genomic score. Combining radiographic and genomic markers should contribute to a more precise clinical disease severity classification in pediatric CAP. Purpose or Case Report: Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome, or Wilkie's syndrome, is an obscure condition in which an acute angulation between the aorta and SMA leads to compression of the third part of the duodenum. Subsequently, patients typically present with a constellation of gastrointestinal findings that closely resemble small bowel obstruction, early satiety, and anorexia. SMA syndrome is most often observed in the setting of rapid weight loss, wasting conditions, and corrective spinal surgeries, where a decrease in retroperitoneal fat diminishes the cushion between the aorta and SMA, causing vascular compression of the duodenum. Diagnosis of SMA syndrome is one of exclusion and is based on the combination of highly suspicious clinical findings and confirmatory diagnostic imaging evidence of obstruction. Upper GI Fluoroscopy can demonstrate a dilated first and second portion of the duodenum, with compression of the third portion, and delayed passage of contrast past midline. Ultrasound and computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enable measurement of the aortomesenteric angle and distance, with normal values ranging from 25-60\u00b0 and 10-28mm, respectively, and values indicative of SMA syndrome ranging from 6-15\u00b0 and 2-8mm, respectively.We present a classic case of SMA syndrome in a 15-year-old patient. The patient presented with clinical symptoms consisting of scoliosis, chronic nausea and vomiting, weight loss, and anorexia. The patient then underwent Upper GI Fluoroscopy which demonstrated duodenal dilatation and delayed contrast transit past midline, achieved only after prolonged decubitus and prone positioning. Subsequently, abdominal ultrasound demonstrated an aortomesenteric angle of 10-18\u00b0 and an aortomesenteric distance of 5 mm. Lastly, abdominal MRI demonstrated an aortomesenteric angle of 15\u00b0 and an aortomesenteric distance of",

Validation of installed systems can and should be accomplished in order to optimize the level of sensitivity and effectiveness of each FMDS installed in situ. Purpose or Case Report: To describe and discuss some of the challenges of performing DEXA scans on pediatric patients including positioning, technical obstacles, reference data and post-processing and describing how to overcome some of these challenges.1. Positioning: Many patients with syndromes, have scoliosis, para or quadriplegia, or contractures that make placing the patient on the table difficult. In these patients, imaging has to be adapted to the patients' abilities and some components may need to be eliminated. With cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy for example, the whole body and AP spine might have to be deferred and only a hip and forearm obtained.2. Technical obstacles: There are many technical obstacles that can present challenges when performing DEXA scans on pediatric patients. Patients who have prostheses or metal rods present technical obstacles. There is no way to remove the metal artifacts in a whole body scan on these patients, so a hip or forearm might be the most accurate way to obtain the patient's bone density due to this technical factor.3. Reference Data: The reference data for pediatrics is limited in national data bases. For example, a total Z-score will not be factored for children under the age of 5 because there is not enough information in the national database for comparison. There is also not enough information on children of certain ethnicities. This presents a problem when diagnosing and treating children with abnormal bone density.4. Post-processing could be different for each user. It can also be different for machines manufactured by different companies. For example, a machine made by Hologic might produce different numbers than a machine made by General Electric. Also, if the user does not place the post-processing tools the exact same way the prior user did, the results can vary.Overcoming some of these challenges has presented opportunities to grow. Sedation is used for children who may not be able to be perfectly still for a Dexa and positioning tools help on some of the more challenging patients. Learning how to work around prostheses and working with the ordering physicians and radiologists with the limited amount of reference data are a few ways of growing from these challenges. Placement of post-processing tools are the key to providing key information in comparing Dexa scans for patients who have them regularly for evaluations. Staff Education is the largest challenge to overcome. Purpose or Case Report: PET/MRI is a relatively new imaging modality whose efficacy is still being determined. One of the major draws to PET/MR over PET/CT is the reduction in radiation exposure to patients. This is especially desirable in the pediatric population due to the likelihood of multiple exposures during their lifetime, and the increased sensitivity they have to radiation. A typical whole body PET/CT exam can take about 30 minutes, whereas a typical whole body PET/MR exam takes about 90 minutes at our institution. The introduction of a new 3D T2 Dixon technique sequence for PET/MR has the potential of decreasing total scan time significantly, however maintaining current image quality and diagnostic value is critical. Our objective is to test out this new sequence to see whether scan times are reduced and if it is a viable diagnostic replacement for our current T2 sequence.",

Motion and exposure factors were big topics.CR's low bone resolution has been posing a challenge with the risk of overexposure; DR's auto stitching brought the fast image acquisition with better quality and high volume capacity, still posing some issues with manual stitching and the overlap of vertebras. Discussions were conducted on several scoliosis and example cases were identified. Most importantly, the accuracy of the images for optimum diagnosis was our priority at CHOA. Speed stitching was identified as a solution for many of the inefficiencies in other technologies. With Speed stitching, we were able to reduce a scoliosis exam from 15 minutes to about 4 minutes with lower radiation and better quality.",

            "text": "Results: A case-based education for speed stitch vs other ways of stitching was developed and comparison cases with other methods of stitching were demonstrating for comparison and contrast. Reviews by the radiologists determine the advantages of speed stich and full transition to that technology is in process for the whole system at CHOA. Conclusions: Beside the higher initial cost, using speed stitch was faster. It demonstrated better image quality, less dose and better accuracy.Technologists moving from CR/DR to speed stitch had no challenges or issues learning the new technology. Mostly everyone thought it was more efficient and easier to use. Purpose or Case Report: In 2017, roughly 2 trillion (2,000,000,000,000) medical images were produced, reviewed, reported, archived, and used in the detection and management of disease. Based on historical trends, this number has doubled every 5 years and is accelerating. This explosive growth in imaging data has created major opportunities for the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The question is less whether radiologists, and technologists, will be replaced by AI (they will not) and more about whether we could survive without AI. Although intelligent algorithms have been used for some time in segments of the imaging field, new methods of machine learning, based particularly on \"deep learning\", are much more powerful. Many of the deep learning publications today point to the promise of significant advances in efficiency, precision, reproducibility, and prognostic abilities.If AI will not replace radiologists/technologists but rather augment them with tools to meet the rising demands for diagnostic imaging, then it is imperative that we have a basic understanding of the concepts and language that defines this area of knowledge. In the not so distant past the average technologist understood the basics of film processing but wouldn't even recognize the words DICOM or EMR; we are now at that point of change with AI. Deep learning, machine learning, neural networks, ground truth, the list goes on. The goal of this presentation is to provide a basic framework of the concepts, terminology, and references to how AI has, and likely, will be employed in medical imaging, thus making us better practitioners and partners with this technology. Purpose or Case Report: Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH), is a disorder that primarily affects children, but can affect individuals of all ages. Langerhans cells are cells that are responsible for regulating immune system in our bodies. They are mostly found in the skin, spleen, lymph nodes, liver and bone marrow. In patients who have LCH, these cells grow and multiply excessively. The abnormal growth of the Langerhans cells causes a formation of tumors called granulomas. LCH can affect different areas of the body: skin, nails, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system, pituitary and thyroid gland, liver, lungs and bones. The severity and symptoms of the disease vary in individual patients and are dependent on the organs and systems affected. Oftentimes, LCH can be found in multiple areas of the body and when that happens, the disease becomes a multisystem disease. The most common system affected by LCH, seen in about 80 % of individuals affected, is the skeletal system. Granulomas, which develop most commonly in the flat bones such as skull and long bones of arms and legs, cause sclerotic and lytic lesions that can in turn become the cause of pathologic fractures. Therefore it is crucial, to recognize the radiographic signs of skeletal manifestations of LCH. Radiography is the preliminary imaging of choice and skeletal surveys are oftentimes the best assessment of the status of LCH prior and post treatment. The purpose of this abstract is to describe radiographic appearances associated with Langerhans Cell",

EIThe radiolucent bed hood caused a decrease of approximately 13% of the radiation reaching the image detector. Utilizing the imaging tray in the Giraffe Bed caused a decrease of approximately 5% of the radiation reaching the image detector. Images taken at the shortest SID resulted in the highest doses and least optimal EI numbers as anticipated. Please note Image 1 had an inconsistant EI measurement. Conclusions: During the study, varying the SID had the most significant impact on radiation doses and EI numbers compared to the other factors caused by the Giraffe Bed. The maximum SID allowed when the bed hood is raised is only 32\" which produces higher radiation doses and EI numbers compared to imaging through the bed hood in the down position at a greater SID. When designing an imaging process, the primary consideration should compensate for a greater SID to reduce the radiation dose and EI number. Imaging at a greater SID also allows the technologist to select a wider range of technical factors and avoid over exposure of the smallest neonatal patients. Purpose or Case Report: Anesthesiologists face challenges in practicing in locations outside of the operating room. In particular when working in the MRI environment there may be unfamiliarity of the physiologic monitors and other equipment, MRI safety policies and procedures, limited access to expected equipment or additional anesthesia providers, unsure imaging protocols and positions as well as inability to rescue patients in the MRI scanner room.",

Additional false positive uptakes localizing to previously treated neuroblastoma and representing post-surgical changes.-Explore false negative MIBG uptake in neuroblastoma or neural crest tumors (i.e. ganglioneuroma and metastatic neuroblastoma liver lesions showing little to no uptake.) Key Point: Non-MIBG avid neuroblastoma may require troubleshooting with 18F-DOPA or 18F-FDG PET-CT.-Review cases of secondary tumors/malignancies occurring in the setting neuroblastoma, with variable uptake on MIBG (Increased MIBG uptake in renal cell carcinoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma; no MIBG uptake in myofibroma of the jaw and a mucoepidermoid salivary gland tumor.) Key Point: Suggest further dedicated imaging and correlation with tissue sampling if a lesion is suspected clinically. Results: A pictorial review of false positive and false negative cases at SPECT-CT I-123 MIBG imaging of neuroblastoma patients will be discussed. SPECT-CT may help localize areas of uptake and minimize false-positive results. Conclusions: Recognizing pitfalls during SPECT-CT I-123 MIBG imaging of neuroblastoma patients will help radiologists correctly interpret findings and help guide proper treatment and management.

They can become un-cooperative and move during the scan, resulting in non-diagnostic images due to motion artefacts. We previously reported in a prospective, randomized controlled trial that animated educational videos shown to children before their MRI scan reduced the percentage of children needing repeated MRI sequences and improved children's confidence of staying still for at least 30 minutes.

The second key driver we looked at was education. The goal was to educate patients on the risks of sedation. This approach might aid in reducing the demand for SMRI slots. We also wanted to recruit the help of ordering clinicians to share with patients our information sheet on sedation, and child life contact information, if families chose to go the non-sedation route. The third key driver was MRI simulation. With the help of Child Life, divert more patients to our MRI simulator and/or Virtual Reality (VR) goggles, then, if successful, on to an unsedated scan. Finally, reduce MRI scan times. Towards this effort, we set out to reduce protocol standards to the minimum necessary for quality scans; as well as reduce sequencing times in order to further abbreviate scans. Results: In Aug 2017, we introduced simulator Fridays. With the aid of Child Life services, eligible patients were offered the opportunity to try the MRI simulator. Once successful, the child would then be scheduled for an immediate unsedated MRI. By Dec 2017, we saw a dip in SMRI wait time from 62 days to 52 days, a 16% improvement. On 01 Feb 2018, we added a third sedation room on Mondays. The additional sedation resource achieved the greatest impact. By 30 Sep 2018, wait times had fallen to a low of 18 days, a 71% reduction from Jul 2017. Conclusions: By far our most dramatic gains have been from the increase in sedation resources.

Conclusions: Our results suggest that PEM POCUS does not impair growth of RADS US from the ED. More work is needed to determine if PEM POCUS for SSTI impaired growth for RAD US for SSTI, but the small growth in POCUS SSTI exams suggests lack of growth in RAD US for SSTI is due to nearing maximum capacity.

Contrast enhanced voiding urosonography (ceVUS) is a highly sensitive examination to diagnose VUR. Following FDA approval for the use of an ultrasound contrast agent for ceVUS in children, there is increasing interest in learning how to do the ceVUS examination. Ultrasound (US) phantoms that depict VUR are not available. We created 3D-printed phantoms as teaching tools to simulate the grades of VUR during the ceVUS examination. Methods & Materials: MR urograms that depicted varying degrees of urinary tract dilation in infants were identified and segmented to represent the four highest grades of VUR, one kidney for each grade. The segmented kidneys were connected to a CAD generated bladder, urethra, and ureter. Kidneys were paired to create two models to simulate the 4 grades of reflux that involved the upper urinary tract. The renal models were printed in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and embedded into a silicon (smooth-on eco flex 30) mold of an infantile abdomen and pelvis. The PVA parts were dissolved leaving behind cavities of the renal anatomy in the silicon. Printed posts were added to open and close the ureters to simulate grade 1 reflux. A catheter was placed in the urethra to enable filling. Results: GE LOGIQ E9 US system with a C2-9 contrast enabled transducer was used to image the models. One operator administered the contrast-saline solution in the urethral catheter while the other obtained US images. The US transducer was placed on the anatomic regions of the flanks, abdomen and pelvis with US coupling gel. Still and cine US images were obtained. Each kidney was easily visualized, as were the ureters and bladder including visualization of all anatomic structures in a single image. Images highly resembled clinical examinations. Conclusions: These ceVUS phantoms are reusable and can be used as a versatile teaching tool to demonstrate and practice the ceVUS procedure while depicting the appearance of different grades of VUR in children.Disclosures:All authors have disclosed no financial interests, arrangements or affiliations in the context of this activity.",

Moreover, fMRU is an accurate diagnostic tool to differentiate calyceal diverticula from renal cysts. In our sample, all diverticula were identified within a 15 minute delay cut-off, which allows to perform shorter examinations. Delays of over 30 minutes are hence unnecessary. In children <5 years of age, diagnosis of WT should be favored over NR when a renal mass is round and exophytic. Homogeneity favors the diagnosis of perilobar NRs. Imaging is not effective in identifying capsule (a key pathological discriminator of NR vs WT). We suggest 1.75 cm as the optimal cutoff for differentiating between NR vs. small WT. Furthermore, one model was used to plan a multidisciplinary surgical approach as well as educate the patient and family.Conclusions: Multiphase scan segmentation technique can produce a complexmodel without compromising structural detail. The composite model aids preoperative planning for complex surgeries. This process can be extended to merging of any temporally related images. Suzanne E.

Although multiple methods of HUS ventricular measurements exist, it is unclear if linear HUS measurements are concordant with other imaging modalities and how they correlate with ventricular volumes.Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess correlation between Frontal Occipital Horn Ratio (FOHR) and Frontal Temporal Horn Ratio (FTHR) indices obtained from HUS, with that of MRI, and to correlate FOHR and FTHR with ventricular volumes.Methods & Materials:We retrospectively included 100 infants at < 3 months of age with ventriculomegaly who had head ultrasound (HUS) and head MRI in a 3 day period without interval intervention. Each study, HUS and MRI was reviewed by 2 independent and blinded observers. Each observer measured the FOHR (bifrontal horn dimension + bioccpital horn dimension/ 2*biparietal diameter) and FTHR (bifrontal horn dimension + bitemporal horn dimension/ 2*biparietal diameter). MR images were used to calculate true ventricular and intracranial volumes and the ratio of the ventricular to intracranial volume (Vetricular volume ratio -VVR) was calculated using Analyze software. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland Altman analyses were generated to evaluate inter-observer concordance between a) the 2 HUS observations, b) the 2 MRI observations, and c) between the HUS and MRI observations for the FOHR and FTHR. Correlation between the HUS and MRI FOHR and FTHR with the VVR was assessed using Pearson correlation analysis. Results: ICC showed excellent correlation between the two reviewers in HUS FOHR (r=0.91), MRI FOHR (r=0.96) and HUS FTHR (r=0.91) and good correlation for the MRI FTHR index (r=0.86). ICC showed excellent correlation between the HUS FOHR and MRI FOHR (r=0.84). ICC showed good correlation between the mean HUS FTHR and MRI FTHR (r=0.85). Bland Altman plots of the FOHR and FTHR between mean observations of HUS and MRI showed excellent agreement in both cases. VVR had high correlation with HUS FHOR (r=0.87), MRI FOHR (r=0.85), HUS FTHR (r=0.83) and MRI FTHR (r=0.79). Conclusions: Frontal occpital horn ratio and frontal temporal horn ratio indices obtained from ultrasound in infants with ventriculomegaly show excellent inter-observer correlation, correlate with MRI derived indices, and correlate with ventricular volumes. This is therefore a promising tool for future studies on management strategies in infantile ventriculomegaly.Incidence and Concordance of Suspected Intraventricular Hemorrhage (IVH) on Fetal US and MRI in Open SpinalDysraphism with Postnatal Follow-Up Ryne A. Didier, didierr@email.chop.edu; Juan S. Martin-Saavedra, MD, Edward R. Oliver, MD, PhD, Suzanne E. DeBari, RDMS, RVT, RT, Julie S. Moldenhauer, MD, Nahla Khalek, Lori J. Howell, DNP, MS, RN, Gregory G. Heuer, N. Scott Adzick, Beverly G. Coleman, MD; Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA Disclosures: All authors have disclosed no financial interests, arrangements or affiliations in the context of this activity. Purpose or Case Report: Ependymal nodularity, layering debris, or susceptibility artifact can suggest intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) by fetal ultrasound (US) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in suspected open spinal dysraphism. However, imaging findings overlap with grey matter heterotopia (GMH). The goal of this study was to assess US and MRI in the prenatal detection and characterization of IVH in open spinal dysraphism and determine potential predictive factors that may suggest IVH over GMH. Methods & Materials: A retrospective, IRB-approved review of pregnant patients referred to our institution for suspected open spinal dysraphism from 1/2013-4/2018 was conducted. Prenatal and postnatal US and MRI reports were reviewed for findings of suspected IVH or GMH. Neonatal chart review was performed to determine fetal or postnatal surgical intervention. Results: 482 cases were confirmed to have open spinal dysraphism by US with 467 corresponding fetal MRIs and 216 postnatal MRIs. Ependymal nodularity was seen in 1338%) of fetal US and MRIs, respectively (\u03ba=0.56).Increased lateral and third ventricular size as continuous variables were both associated with suspected IVH by both US and MRI (p<0.05) but not with IVH on postnatal MRI (p>0.07). Even after excluding postnatal MRIs performed > 21 days of age or after an intracranial intervention, IVH was seen in only 6/17 (35.3%) suspected by fetal US and 13/28 (46.4%) suspected by fetal MRI. In this patient subset, when IVH was seen on both US and MRI prenatally (n=11), subjects with IVH on postnatal MRI demonstrated increased incidence of persistent hindbrain herniation when compared to those without Fetal US and MRI reported similar rates of IVH, agreement between modalities was moderate, and concordance with postnatal MRI findings was fair. Increased lateral and third ventricular size may suggest IVH over GMH in the setting of ependymal nodularity although evidence of IVH is infrequently present on postnatal MRI. IVH may cause decreased cerebrospinal fluid resorption leading to persistent hindbrain herniation and continued evidence of blood products postnatally.KaylaCort, DO, kayla.cort12@gmail.com; Hansel J.

This study compares the image quality and size-specific dose estimates (SSDE) of DECT and SECT in pediatric thoracic CTA.Methods & Materials:This institutional review board approved, retrospective study included 109 children (median age 7.5 years, 1 day to 17 years) who underwent DECT (n=53) or SECT (N=56) thoracic CTA between September 2014 and March 2018. DECT was performed on a Somatom Flash dualsource scanner (Siemens) with 80 and 140 kVp. SECT was performed at 80 kVp. Both DECT and SECT were performed with automatic exposure control and iterative reconstruction. SSDE was calculated based on effective chest diameter determined by the patient's age. Image quality was subjectively scored on a scale of 1 to 4 (1 excellent, 4 non-diagnostic). For analysis, data were divided into four groups based on the effective diameter, and two-sample t and Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed. Results: For the four size ranges of <15cm (group 1), 15SSDE was statistically higher for DECT (p<0.1). Median patient age was similar between DECT and SECT in all four groups.

Despite increasing CTA utilization for evaluation of pediatric PE, the rate of positive cases remains low, increasing exposure to ionizing radiation secondary to lack of evidence-based clinical imaging support guidelines. We propose a deep learning model for estimating risk of PE in pediatric patients analyzing free-text clinical notes.Methods & Materials:After IRB approval, a retrospective data base was collected including 5189 pediatric patients (1 month -18 years, 2387 female, 2799 male, 1 unknown) seen at a tertiary care pediatric hospital between 1/1/98 and 2/1/17 who had at least one contrast enhanced chest CT exam in their electronic medical record (EMR). EMR data collected up to one year before CT included heterogeneous clinical notes (H&P, ED notes, discharge), with temporal sequence maintained in the data base. Semantic data mapping and neural embedding technique were integrated in a single framework to produce an unsupervised text summarization method for handling the clinical notes. A many-to-one stacked recurrent neural network (RNN) was designed to model temporal dependency of patient visits with weighted categorical cross entropy loss function. The RNN model was trained with Adam optimizer (learning rate = 0.001) and 100 batch size. Results: The studied population had a total of 11744 chest CTs and between 5 -1400 clinical notes/patient. The database contained 4% positive PE cases (545). 80% of reports were randomly selected for training the neural network model and 20% for hold-out testing while maintaining patient-level separation. Our model achieved 0.81 AUC-ROC on the 20% hold-out test set. Conclusions: The model predicts PE risk accurately with high sensitivity, as well as returning most of positive PE cases (high recall).Artificial Intelligence Correction of Image Artifacts forFaster Pediatric Lung MRI David Y.

Ibrahim, ala.ibrahim@sickkids.ca; Michael R. Aquino, MD; Radiology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada Disclosures: All authors have disclosed no financial interests, arrangements or affiliations in the context of this activity.Purpose or Case Report: Review epidemiology and imaging work-up of thoracic spine fractures in pediatric trauma patients over a 16-year period at an academic children's hospital. Determine the diagnostic performance of radiographs for identifying thoracic spine fractures in the setting of trauma Methods & Materials: This was a retrospective review of all trauma patients \u226418-year-old that presented to an academic children's hospital between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2016. A trauma patient database was used to identify all patients with thoracic spine fractures. Recorded data included: patient demographics, modality and results of imaging performed, mechanism of injury, injury severity score(ISS), associated injuries, management details, and patient's outcome Results: There were 3,265 trauma patients identified. Of these, 90 (3%) had thoracic spine fractures. The most common 27%) surgical. Thoracic spine fracture was significantly associated with 1) the presence of a fracture at another spinal level, 2) soft tissue spine injury, and 3) ISS. ISS as a predictor of thoracic spine fracture resulted in sensitivity 77.6% (63.4 -88.2) and specificity 57.1% (53.9-60.4) using a score >10 on the receiver-operator curve. Radiographs were obtained in 85/90 patients with thoracic spine fractures. Of these, 75/85 had additional imaging: 46/75 (61%) CT, 10/75 (13%) MRI, and 19/75 (25%) both CT and MRI. Three patients had both CT and MRI only, and 1 patient had only CT. A total of 276 thoracic fractures were detected in the 90 patients. Three simple compression fractures were missed by CT. MRI identified all fractures seen on radiographs and CT. Conclusions: Thoracic spine fractures are significantly associated with the presence of other spine fractures and softtissue injuries and increasing ISS. Radiographs have poor sensitivity and can miss clinically significant fractures that require surgical management.Imaging Findings Following Button BatteryIngestions Neil Grey, neil.grey@ucdenver.edu; Peter E.

Severe damage can occur in as little as 2 hours after ingestion, and complications can have a latency period of more than 2 weeks. Given the potentially for severe outcomes, beginning in 2012 the authors' institution began performing serial MRI/MRAs of the chest on all BBI patients after retrieval. Methods & Materials: Following approval by IRB, we conducted a retrospective review of all BBI cases between April 2012 and September 2018. Clinical history and endoscopic findings were collected and all imaging studies were rereviewed. The degree and location of mediastinal inflammatory change was graded and the presence of complications was recorded: periesophageal, peritracheal and periaortic inflammation as well as fistula, fluid collection, and vascular injury. Results: 23 patients with BBI had at least one MRI/MRA chest for a total of 51 MRI/MRAs. The cohort was 70% male with median age 2 years [0.94-17 y]",

Patients with incomplete clinical information and with prematurely halted studies were excluded. Sequences performed include Steady State Free Precession (SSFP), Single Shot Fast Spin Echo (SSFSE), T1-weighted Spoiled Gradient Echo 2D (SPGR), SPGR 3D (SPGR-3D), SSFP 3D (SSFP -3D) Echo Planar Imaging (EPI), and SSFP Cine. The SAR (W/kg) and acquisition time values were retrieved from the DICOM header. The SED (J/kg), which reflects the sum of energy absorbed by the patient in the course of the MRI examination, was calculated as the SAR multiplied by the acquisition time in seconds. The accumulated SED is the sum of energy absorbed by the patient in the course of the MRI examination. Descriptive data is presented as mean \u00b1 SD.

Thin BHF (n=19, 56%) and isolated corner fractures (n=2, 6%) were only seen on initial skeletal survey and therefore were determined to represent signs of acute phase (n=21). On follow-up, most (n=11, 52%) had thick BHF and others had BHFG (n=3, 14%), DC (n=6, 29%), or were normal (n=1, 5%).12 cases of thick BHF (n=7) or BHFG (n=5) were noted on initial surveys. six of them had corner fractures. On follow-up, 3 (25%) had DC and 7 (58%) were normal. None of these demonstrated thin BHF on follow-up.The following signs of healing CMLs were seen in the initial (n=12) and follow-up (n=34) series; IMD (n=7, 15%), DC (n=6, 13%), and SPL (n=4, 9%). SPBF was not evaluated in five patients with concomitant other tibial fractures and was seen in 49% (20/41) of the fractures in the healing phase. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that thin BHF is the most common finding of acute CML fractures. Acute CMLs most commonly progress to thick BHF. SPBF is seen in about half of the healing CMLs. Other findings of healing CML are BHF with endochondral bone filling the gap, increased metaphyseal density, corner deformity and subphyseal lucency. Normal metaphysis on 2-week follow up does not exclude CML as it was seen in about one-fifth of cases.Disclosures: All authors have disclosed no financial interests, arrangements or affiliations in the context of this activity.",

All other authors have disclosed no financial interests, arrangements or affiliations in the context of this activity.Purpose or Case Report: General anesthesia (GA), while not always required, is frequently necessary in infants and children undergoing cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) based on risk-benefit of GA and breath-hold (BH) v/s the diagnostic value of the acquired cine images. Primarily, requirement of BH for cine imaging to evaluate ventricular volumes and function, a key prognostic measure in spectrum of congenital heart diseases, governs the necessity of GA. Herein we review our experience of completely free breathing (FB) CMR, including CArdio-REspiratory Synchronized (CARESync) cine imaging instead of multiple signal averaging (MSA) cine imaging, in unsedated pediatric population.Methods & Materials:We retrospectively reviewed the anesthesia and MRI records for all patients who had undergone CMR between June 2017 and September 2018. Results: Out of 1100 (17.1\u00b17.8, 7.6-65.9 yrs) CMR studies performed a total of 77 (14.5\u00b18.7, 7.6-63.0 yrs) unsedated patients were unable to hold their breath. All these 77 CMR studies were completed without anesthesia using FB-CMR and provided diagnostic image quality. -18.4 yrs), and atrioventricular valve diseases including, moderate-to-severe aortic insufficiency, aortic regurgitation, or mitral stenosis (18: 14.1\u00b15.1, 7.6 -24.2 yrs). Three (13.5\u00b13.0, 10.3 -16.1yrs) patients were indicated for left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC).Conclusions:Our experience demonstrates that complete FB-CMR studies including (CARESync) cine imaging allow elimination of anesthesia while providing diagnostic morphologic, functional and pathophysiologic evaluation in young children, and adolescents considered high-risk for anesthesia. CARESync has been previously reported to improve image quality significantly over MSA and provide comparable ventricular volumes[1]. Furthermore, superior delineation of trabeculation and myocardium from blood pool allows accurate measurements of non-compacted and compacted myocardium critical for HCM and LVNC and overall better wall motion assessment. It may be worthwhile to explore increased utilization of FB-CMR to further reduce need for anesthesia.[1] Krishnamurthy R et al.

Treatment requires distinct definitions of bulky disease, response to therapy, and organ involvement. In this way, pediatric radiologists form a center role in the medical care of affected children. This educational exhibit examines pediatric lymphoma diagnosis and response to therapy by detailing the varying classification systems, including the newer PET-related Deauville and Lugano classification systems.The Ann Arbor staging classification system for Hodgkin's lymphoma was initially developed in the 1970's and anatomically classifies lymphoma by site and number of lymph nodes affected, cross-diaphragmatic disease, and extralymphatic organ dissemination. More recently, after the introduction of PET/CT, newer classification systems which incorporated tumor metabolism were developed -including Deauville and Lugano. Notably, these systems are commonly applied to both Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This educational exhibit includes a discussion of these various systems as well as annotated examples. Additionally, risk stratification is discussed using strata defined by the Children's Oncology Group (COG), EuroNet, and Pediatric Hodgkin Consortium.After review, the pediatric radiologist should feel more comfortable staging and classifying response to treatment of lymphoma using PET assessment principles.Childhood Interstitial (Diffuse) Lung Disease: A Pattern Recognition Approach to Diagnosis in InfantsTeresa Liang, MD BSc, teresaliang86@gmail.com; Edward Lee, MD, MPH; Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA Disclosures: All authors have disclosed no financial interests, arrangements or affiliations in the context of this activity.",

The average age and patient body size of our patient population were statistically similar. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that there is a significant decrease in SSDE of CT studies performed at our institution compared to outside referral institutions. This finding is important in highlighting the successful application of the optimization principle of ALARA at our institution. Furthermore, the degree of SSDE variability among referral institutions is important in showing that the choice of facility is likely a major determinant in radiation dose to children in the region. Outside facilities may benefit from additional training regarding dose optimization techniques in the pediatric population.Bismuth breast shields for pediatric patients undergoing CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis: the benefits Joshua H.

There was a further increase in understanding of ACR appropriateness, with pre-lecture rating of knowledge increasing from 1.91 (95% CI 1.54-2.29) out of 5 to 3.61 (95% CI 3.33-3.90) post-lecture. Other areas of notable improvement included understanding of appropriate imaging orders for neurologic pathology (2.61 to 4.06 pre-and post-lecture) and in the abdomen/pelvis (2.78 to 4.17 pre-and post-lecture). Residents also provided positive subjective feedback upon conclusion of the program and reported a beneficial effect on their education. Conclusions: A radiologist-driven lecture series in a pediatric residency can improve resident understanding of appropriate ordering practices and radiation risk. Radiologist participation in pediatric residency training is well-received. Future directions for research could include evaluation of the rate of appropriateness compliance.Right ventricular pulmonary regurgitation and two dimensional right ventricular strain in repairedTetralogy of Fallot in children Rong-Zhen Ouyang, Master, oyrongzhen@163.com; Yumin Zhong, Chen Guo, Li-Wei Hu, master; Radiology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine, Shanghai, China Disclosures: All authors have disclosed no financial interests, arrangements or affiliations in the context of this activity.Purpose or Case Report: Many patients with repaired Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) have right ventricular (RV) volume overload due to pulmonary regurgitation (PR)and would have ventricular deformation as time goes by after repaired surgery. We studied the effect of pulmonary regurgitation on global and regional right ventricular (RV) deformation, and their relationships with conventional diagnostic parameters.Methods & Materials:Cases of repaired Tetralogy of Fallot with the duration time of 5-15years between surgery and cardiac magnetic resonance(CMR) were enrolled. The main pulmonary regurgitation fraction(PRF), RV volume and RV ejection fraction(RVEF), RV three segments (basal, mid, apical) of radial, circumferential and longitudinal strain were analyzed on CVI 46 (Circle Vascular Imaging, Canada).

Current guidelines recommend \"complete cardiac evaluation\" at ten years of age, but do not specify the type of imaging modality. We have been performing cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) routinely by 10 years of age. We sought to determine the progression of BMD cardiomyopathy during the adolescent years among patients who have evidence of fibrosis by late gadolinium enhancement(LGE).Methods & Materials:At our center, all BMD patients undergo CMR when sedation is no longer necessary by age 10 years. We retrospectively reviewed the CMR studies performed between June 2013 and June 2018. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test. Results: There were 43 BMD patients who underwent 98 CMR studies with LGE assessment. The average age of the first CMR study was 15.5\u00b14.8 (range 7-25) years. Of these 27/43 (63%) patients had negative LGE and 14/43 (33%) had positive LGE on the first study. The LGE positive group was significantly older (p<0.001) with average age 19.5\u00b13.1 years (range 16-25 years) compared to 13.5\u00b14 years (range 7-22 years). Patients who were LGE positive had a lower mean LVEF compared with LGE negative patients (53.9\u00b111.7% vs 62.6\u00b15.3% p-value < 0.005). 31 patients had serial studies for a total of 72 CMR studies. Of the LGE negative patients 2/27 (7%) became positive over a 12 month period. In serial follow up, LGE positive patients showed a statistically significant decline in LVEF. Over an interval of 2.6\u00b1 1.7 years, LGE positive patients had a decline in LVEF from 53.9\u00b111.7% to 48.5 \u00b1 10.9 % (pvalue < 0.005). Conclusions: Our study demonstrates a large number of BMD patients with occult cardiomyopathy identified by LGE at a younger age than previously described. Serial studies demonstrated a significant decline in LVEF and increase in LVEDVi over an interval of 2.6\u00b1 1.7 years. CMR studies should be considered in BMD patients when sedation is no longer required. Escalation of medical therapy should be considered for patients who demonstrate evidence of fibrosis. Larger longitudinal studies should be considered to better isolate independent risk factors of cardiomyopathy progression.Fetal MRI in the Prognostication of Prenatally-diagnosedOmphalocele Rachel Wise 1 , rwise2011@gmail.com; Jessica H.

Few prenatal prognostic indicators have been previously identified. We propose that features found on fetal MRI can predict morbidity and mortality in patients diagnosed with omphalocele.Methods & Materials:We performed a retrospective review of all patients prenatally diagnosed with omphalocele who received fetal MRI from 2006-2017 at a single institution. Thirty neonates met study criteria. Imaging biomarkers identified on fetal MR included observed-to-expected total fetal lung volume (O/E TFLV); herniation of stomach, spleen, or liver; omphalocele size; and number of umbilical cord vessels. The primary outcome was survival, whether to birth or to discharge. Bivariate and multivariable regression analyses were performed. Results: Seventy percent of patients survived to birth, and 45.2% survived to discharge. On bivariate analysis, observed/expected total fetal lung volume (O/E TFLV) correlated with survival to discharge (69 \u00b1 29% vs 39 \u00b1 25% for survivors vs. non-survivors, respectively (p = 0.007)). 23.1% of patients with stomach herniation (p = 0.021) and no patients with a herniated spleen survived to discharge (p<0.001). Liver herniation on MRI approached, but did not reach, significance for survival to discharge (53% vs. 81% for survivors vs. nonsurvivors, respectively (p=0.06)).On multivariable regression analysis after controlling for gestational age and gender, stomach herniation on MRI predicted lower likelihood of surviving at discharge (Adjusted Odds Ratio: 0.04 [CI: 0.004, 0.557], p=0.016).",

Requirement for oxygen supplementation at birth was observed in 12 of those patients and mechanical ventilation was necessary in the remaining 2 patients. O/E NLV did not significantly correlate with symptomatology at birth (p=0.15) or delay in feeding (p=0.14). O/E NLV did significantly correlate with requirement for supplementary oxygen (p=0.05) and requirement for mechanical ventilation (p=0.05) with a mean O/E NLV of 0.62 \u00b1 0.17 and 0.4 \u00b1 0.005 respectively.

All other authors have disclosed no financial interests, arrangements or affiliations in the context of this activity. or Case Report: To test radiographic diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing between stable distal radius buckle fractures (BF) from other distal radius fractures (DRF) after introducing a measurement guideline.Background: Management of pediatric forearm fractures has become fracture specific, as treatment of the common stable BF is trending toward home management with a removable wrist splint while other potentially unstable, DRF require immobilization and orthopaedic follow-up. Diagnostic accuracy between BF and DRF is therefore imperative. We developed and suggested our radiologists use a measurement guideline to aid diagnosis with this general rule: an isolated distal radius fracture in a child > 7y is not likely to be a BF if the fracture-to-physis distance is < 1 cm.Methods & Materials:This study was part of a quality improvement project between the Departments of Radiology and Orthopaedic Surgery. Medical record search identified children >3y with closed distal radius fractures diagnosed after all of our 26 pediatric radiologists received explanation of the measurement guideline. The radiology reports for the initial forearm and/or wrist series were compared to the final diagnosis (BF or DRF) as determined by consensus of 1 pediatric radiologist and 1 pediatric hand surgeon. The fracture-to-physis distance was measured for all fractures on the AP and LAT views by 1 author. Results: Results: Before introducing the measurement guideline, radiologists received training to differentiate BF from DRF, but diagnostic accuracy was only 54% in a patient group with 148 BF and 55 DRF, and agreement was 'slight' (\u03ba=0.120, SE=0.058, n=203). In the first 6 months after introducing the measurement guideline, there were 153 children >3y (range 4-16y) with isolated distal radius fractures: 64 (42%) stable BF and 89 (58%) potentially unstable DRF. Report diagnostic accuracy = 84%. Agreement for the diagnosis in this patient group was 'moderate' (\u03ba=0.592, SE=0.066, n=153). Eleven DRF were misdiagnosed as BF (sensitivity 83%). Thirteen BF were misdiagnosed as DRF (specificity 86%). No patient > 7y had a BF less than 1 cm from the physis. Only 1 false positive BF misdiagnosis was made in an older patient with a fracturephysis distance of < 1cm.

There is a need for active, automatic tracking of scan log in a MRI machine to 1) determine operational efficiency, 2)disease specific scan information, 3) identifying patient specific scan metrics.Currently, there exist no customizable open-source solution that can automatically obtain information from MRI scanners. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate implementation of a novel, customizable QI tool that can automatically extract scan log data from a MRI scanner in a pediatric setting.Methods & Materials: 'LogServer'(https://yarra.rocks/doc/server/yarralogserver/) was developed for use in Siemens MRI machines. This uses the 'Yarra' framework -an open source framework for complex MRI reconstructions. 'LogServer' monitors sequences, parses MRI sequences into discrete exams, generates 'EPIC-formatted' patient names, monitors scanner health, and tags exams with body region information. All extracted data were stored in 'PostgreSQL' -an open source database. 'ReDASH', an open source dashboard, was used to create customizable dashboards. In this study, for a clinical MRI scanner, we looked at 1) Daily scanner efficiency, defined as ratio of total hours scanner unused time to total hours (8am-7pm workday), and 2) Scan efficiency, defined as time when scanner was running to total time when the patient was on table. Results: 'LogServer' was successfully able to automatically extract scan logs from MRI machines on an hourly basis, extract all relevant information, and visualize them in needed format using a remote PHI secure web browser.Figure 1(https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fvyrSjq96EcHaAv9GenX1 v4b070tFP3l) demonstrates the scanner schedule for any given day.Figure 2(https://drive.google.com/open?id=1O7fxAIhWrAeqFVr3qRW 5QyMGaN3F0mnX) shows the scan metrics for a selected patient, including total scan time, idle time during a scan session, as well time for adjustments in scanner. Our daily scanner efficiency for a week was 64% while scan efficiency was 76.3 \u00b1 10%. Conclusions: We demonstrated a robust customizable QI tool that lets continuous automatic monitoring of MRI scanner. This is a useful tool for hospital administrators, clinical managers, clinical leaders in their informed decision making.Beyond the numbers: favorable perceptions of a scoreless peer review pilot program.A.

We would describe the clinical usefulness of the dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance (MR) lymphangiography for imaging of the lymphatic system in pediatric patients.Methods & Materials:A retrospectively evaluation of experience with DCE MR lymphangiography in four patients (Mean age 11.3 \u00b1 5.5 years) was performed. The access needle was placed in the central part of both inguinal lymph nodes (LNs) under ultrasound guidance. CT contrast agent was injected into the LNs to confirm proper access under fluoroscopic guidance. After moving patients into the MR imaging room, MR contrast material was injected into the inguinal LNs for DCE MR imaging by using T1-weighted 3D gradient sequence with VIBE in the coronal plane that can be acquired in 15-30 seconds was repeated every other minute to study lymphatic transit into the cisterna chyli and thoracic duct and ultimately into the confluence of the left internal jugular vein and subclavian vein. Results: Three patients were suspected to have protein-losing enteropathy. Two of these patients had a history of Fontan operation and liver transplantation, and one patient had no underlying disease. Another one patient was suspected to have chylothorax with unknown cause. The DCE MR lymphangiographic findings confirmed the presence of relatively normal thoracic duct in one patient, and abnormal thoracic duct dilatation in three patients. We could identify the retroperitoneal lymph system through DCE MR, though it did not provide evidence of the direct lymphatic leak to the retroperitoneal space associated with the symptoms in all patients. However, DCE MR showed an abnormal lymphatic leakage draining into the pleural space in one patient having chylothorax. The DCE MR lymphangiographic finding led to a help in management in all patients, continuation of conservative treatment in two patients, and intervention treatment in two patients. Image quality for visualizing the lymphatic system was considered good by both radiologists in all cases. There were no known adverse effects related to the DCE MR lymphangiography. Conclusions: DCE MR lymphangiography is a recently developed technology, and its clinical application is feasible in pediatric patients. The application of DCE MR lymphangiography would significantly increase in pediatric patients as the lymph-based understanding of many diseases increases.demographics, technical details of the procedure, and follow up imaging was collected. Results: Four KT patients underwent four procedures to embolize the lateral marginal venous system. Technical success was 100% and there were no complications related to the embolization. Two of the four patients underwent additional therapies at the same time including sclerotherapy for venous and lymphatic malformations. Three of the four patients had ultrasound follow up that demonstrated complete occlusion of the treated venous segment. One patient had partial recanalization on further follow up one month after the procedure and underwent laser ablation which was also only partially successful. Conclusions: Embolization of the lateral marginal venous system with the Clarivein TM device may be a good option for effective treatment.Fabrication of a custom pediatric phantom for pediatric interventional radiology endovascular simulation and training.

My educational poster will include anatomy, causes, and symptoms associated with Trigger thumb and a pediatric ultrasound case that relate with a finding of Trigger thumb. Methods & Materials: 3 years old girl presented as an outpatient with a history of bump or nodule to the base of her Left thumb for about a year. The ultrasound of left thumb was order to rule out the nodule and any structure anomaly. Results: Musculoskeletal ultrasound of the left thumb was performed using Musculoskeletal (MSK) superficial setting. The series of longitudinal and transverse images were documented of the nodule area. Based on the sonographic evaluation of the palmar base of the left thumb demonstrated a well-defined ovoid predominantly hypoechoic lesion superficial to the flexor pollicis longus tendon (FPL). The lesion measures 6x1x5mm without vascularity on the color Doppler ultrasound. It did not exert mass effect on the underlying tendon but definitely demonstrated A1 pulley thickening. Dynamic scanning during passive flexion and extension showed difficult tendon gliding underneath the abnormal A1 pulley. This may represent the condition called Pediatric Trigger thumb. Conclusions: In conclusion, Ultrasound should be an initial imaging study of choice for condition such as pediatric trigger thumb. Ultrasound can show varying degrees of flexor pollicis longus(FPL) tendinosis with a distinct nodule, A1 pulley thickening, and tenosynovitis. With ultrasound dynamic scanning is so beneficial to rule our Trigger thumb. Even color Doppler ultrasound plays a huge role in evaluating hyper vascularity in the region of the pulley and surrounding soft tissues. Thus, Ultrasound plays an important role in diagnosis congenital condition such as Pediatric Trigger thumb.

            "text": "Results: After reviewing the exhibit, the reader will be aware of the spectrum of chILD in infants, and be able to use the discussed imaging based algorithm to assist in efficient and accurate diagnosis of various chILD entities in the infant population. Conclusions: chILD in infants constitutes a diverse group of lung abnormalities which can be complex and challenging to diagnose. Aside from the infants with diffuse development disorders, whom typically are only imaged with chest radiographs, the remainder of the diseases in the chILD spectrum presenting in infants can be approached with a CT algorithm utilizing the stepwise assessment of lung volumes, ground glass, and cysts. In conjunction with the patient's demographics and clinical presentation, this algorithm can aid the radiologist in making an accurate and timely diagnosis. Purpose or Case Report: BPM's are often identified prenatally; while some have more detailed imaging and description, many are loosely called congenital pulmonary airway malformations (CPAM). A chest radiograph is usually obtained at birth, but CT imaging is often deferred until 3-6months of age in asymptomatic babies, when surgical removal is being considered. Participation in a presurgical conference has indicated that there is poor standardization of both performance and interpretation of CT for BPM's. High quality studies are most often hampered by poor timing of imaging, poor vascular opacification and obscuration of pathology due to atelectasis. There are four key internal feature of BPM's that help with lesion characterization, differential diagnosis and management decisions. These include: systemic arterial supply; bronchial mucoid impaction; overinflated lung and macroscopic cysts. Reliable recognition and description of these features in all cases is essential for guiding surgical decisions since some lesions can be treated conservatively, especially those with just hyperinflation and mucoid impaction. A feature that tends to be overlooked is mucoid impaction, indicative of bronchial atresia. Cystic changes and overinflated lung may be mischaracterized. Small systemic arteries can be missed. Multiplanar reconstructions and interaction with maximum intensity projections and a 3D dataset are very helpful. This poster aims to educate by providing multiple illustrative imaging examples and a standardized report template useful for radiologists, clinicians, research and registries.",

Purpose or Case Report: With an incidence of 3.25%, breast masses in the pediatric population are a relatively rare phenomenon. Despite this, breast masses are a substantial source of anxiety and concern for parents and patients alike, largely due to the increased awareness of breast cancer in the adult population. Fortunately, the vast majority of masses are benign, and pediatric breast malignancies constitute less than 1% of all pediatric malignancies. Moreover, malignancy tends to be secondary to metastatic disease from lymphoma, leukemia, or rhabdomyosarcoma, as primary breast carcinoma is exceedingly rare. Although initial sonographic characteristics of breast masses may be nonspecific, recommendation for further evaluation with biopsy and/or excision of the mass is usually not recommended due to the rarity of malignancy, and avoidance of disrupting immature breast parenchymal tissue. In adults, the Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System classification is quite accurate for dictating management recommendations. However, this system grossly overemphasizes the risk of malignancy in pediatric patients, as imaging findings are usually discordant with histology. Currently, there are no standardized guidelines for management recommendations of pediatric breast masses, and short-term follow-up ultrasound is usually recommended to evaluate for malignant potential. The purpose of this educational exhibit is to compare the sonographic abnormalities of breast pathologies arising from normal breast development, including but not limited to gynecomastia, mastitis, and abscesses, from those arising from neoplastic processes including fibroadenomas, hemangiomas, arterio-venous malformations, and phyllodes tumors. In addition, the current literature on management recommendations, including indications for MRI and biopsy/excision of breast masses, will be reviewed. Finally, this exhibit will discuss the important role pediatric radiologists play in understanding the epidemiology and natural history of breast pathologies, enabling accurate characterization of masses and appropriate treatment recommendations to further guide patient management. Purpose or Case Report: Pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) is a rare, intrathoracic, malignant tumor in the pediatric population with approximately 500 cases reported worldwide. Over 90% of these cases are in patients below the age of 6. The spectral morphology of PPB is used to classify the lesions along a continuum from the least malignant to the most malignant: type I (cystic) 14%, type II (solid and cystic) 48%, and type III (solid) 38%. Congenital lung cysts are not known to degenerate to become PPB, but the cystic type I PPB may progress to the more aggressive type II or type III PPB. In addition, PPB is associated with cystic nephroma in 30% of cases, and has been linked to the DICER1 mutation which puts these patients at risk for other tumors. For example, the genetic basis of the PPB familial syndrome (which is the heterozygous loss of function mutation of DICER1) includes PPB, cystic nephroma, ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors, ciliary body medulloepithelioma, nodular hyperplasia and differentiated carcinoma of the thyroid gland, pituitary blastoma, pineoblastoma, nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma, and cervical embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma.The purpose of this educational report is to demonstrate various presentations and identify distinguishing features of each type of PPB as seen on initial radiographs with correlation on subsequent CT scans. Only cases where the PPB and type were confirmed by pathology are included. At least one case of the PPB familial syndrome will also be presented. Positive DICER1 mutations will be provided when available, as this information is increasingly used to aid in the treatment decisions. Early recognition of PPB with timely investigation for cystic nephroma and DICER1 mutations can lead to improved patient outcomes. Purpose or Case Report: In 2017, children under the age of 15 accounted for only 10% of the 10 million Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) infections estimated by the World Health Organization. Child carriers of TB pose health risks to their adult caregivers, and children can exhibit greater susceptibility to significant health risks from the infection. Nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection presents disparate health risks and can generate imaging specific findings. This presentation addresses radiologic manifestations of mycobacterial disease as a means to educate pediatric radiologists given the medical significance of mycobacterial infection.",

            "text": "This exhibit will discuss how children may manifest TB infections differently than adults and describe imaging findings of pulmonary and extra-thoracic TB infection in children. Contrasting findings in multi-system NTM infection will also be detailed. The presentation will provide radiologic manifestations of verified mycobacterial infection and emphasize unique characteristics of mycobacterial infection. Results: Pulmonary TB in children may present with diffuse pulmonary disease and/or pleural effusions that can appear more impressive than the clinical presentation seemingly suggests. Extra-pulmonary TB can cause brain abscesses, osteomyelitis, and intra-abdominal infection which have distinct appearances compared to typical bacterial infections. Pathogenic NTM organisms include Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium xenopi, Mycobacterium fortuitum, and Mycobacterium chelonae. MTB commonly infect the soft tissues and cervical lymph nodes as well as the lungs. The radiologic and clinical presentation of mycobacterial infection often depends on the immune status of the child. Mycobacterial recovery is often complicated by inability to obtain a sufficient biologic specimen and lack of growth on routine contrast media. For this reason, pediatric radiologists play a key role in raising appropriate managementguiding concerns for disease. Conclusions: Mycobacterial infection can present differently in children. Radiographic findings suggestive of pediatric TB should prompt testing in relevant contacts.",

LMs are the second most common type of vascular malformation, second to venous malformations (1). The most common locations are in the neck, followed by the axillary region. On MRI, LMs are multiloculated, T2 hyperintense lesions, which may have fluid-fluid levels, and are without flow voids (1, 2). They can involve multiple tissue planes and do not regard anatomical and fascial boundaries (2). Cystic lymphatic malformations are further divided into microcystic, macrocystic, or mixed, based on the size of their cystic components. Macrocystic LMs are composed of larger cysts, while microcystic LMs are composed of smaller cysts and may appear solid on imaging.We present ten cases of microcystic, macrocystic, and mixed lymphatic malformations in a variety of anatomical locations. In addition to demonstrating the imaging findings, we present a review of the literature in regards to each anatomical region. Lymphatic malformations in this presentation include right orbit (n=1), mediastinum (n=2), pulmonary bronchovascular bundles/pleural space (n=1), retroperitoneum (n=1), mesentery (n=2), perirectal and scrotal (n=1), lower extremity (n=2). 6 of these children also had additional sites of T2 hyperintense disease involving the bones or spleen, suggestive of additional lymphangiomas.This presentation summarizes ten cases of lymphatic malformations in a variety of less common anatomical locations and a review of the pertinent literature Purpose or Case Report: Balancing PEEP settings in mechanically ventilated premature infants to maximize air exchange while minimizing barotrauma is typically evaluated using bronchography. A 4D dynamic airway computerized tomography protocol (4D CT) was developed as a less invasive method to evaluate large and small airways collapse at variable PEEP settings. Our purpose was to evaluate the radiation dose from 4D CT and to demonstrate the number of cycles impact on the radiation dose. Methods & Materials: 39 pediatric patients <5 years who underwent imaging as part of routine clinical care between 1/1/16-10/1/18. Dynamic sequential CT scan was performed on Siemens Flash, fixed 70 kVp, fixed 10 mAs. One 4D CT imaging cycle was defined as the time required for one full inspiratory-expiratory cycle at a given PEEP, which ranged between 2-8 seconds. Each cycle contained 7 rotations. The body and skin effective radiation doses were estimated using two methods: (1) the body effective dose is calculated using Monte Carlo simulations of a library of male and female anthropomorphic size and age-specific phantoms. (2) NanoDots optically stimulated luminescent dosimeters were used to measure the peak skin dose (PSD) by placing them on the chest of a newborn phantom for a different number of cycles. Results: Increasing the number of cycle/rotations increased the PSD, dose length product (DLP), effective dose, and the lung organ dose. The estimated effective dose varied depending on the patient's DLP value, patient's gender, and age weighting factors. The average effective dose was higher for female patients. From the simulation's results, the highest organ dose was received by the lungs. The average value for lung dose was 0.9 mSv. Conclusions: Irradiation over the same anatomic region by 4D CT results in accumulation of radiation dose and raising the concern for the potential deterministic effect of skin injury. The maximum measured entrance skin exposure by the 4D CT was orders of magnitude lower than the threshold dose for early transient erythema (2000 mGy). As the PSD increased by increasing the number of rotations, reducing the number of imaging cycles may reduce the overall patient radiation exposure. A differential effective dose in female patients is due to higher end-organ risk from radiation scatter. Extra caution to limit cycles should be exercised when using 4D CT technique in children under 1 year. In addition, DLP would be a better dose metric than CTDI because of DLP metric account for the total irradiated area. Purpose or Case Report: Delayed phase imaging increases the sensitivity of detection of injuries to the urinary tract and also assists in characterizing solid visceral organ injuries at the expense of doubling the radiation dose to the patient. If institutions can lower the rate of these examinations, the cumulative radiation exposure reduction would be substantial. Here we evaluate the rate of delayed phase imaging in the pediatric trauma population at our Level I trauma center as well as the frequency with which these patients demonstrate an indication on portal venous imaging for delayed phase acquisition. Finally, there are minimal guidelines dictating the appropriateness of delayed imaging in pediatric trauma. We include a review of the literature in order to elucidate appropriate indications and help guide clinicians to make evidenced based decisions.",

The primary variable analyzed was acqusition of delayed imaging. Indications for delayed imaging on portal venous phase imaging, including solid organ injury, pelvic fracture, and free fluid, were also reviewed. Given the potential for physiologic free fluid in postpubescent girls, data was also analyzed excluding free fluid as an indication in girls older than 12 years old. Results: 134 patients met the inclusion criteria. Delayed imaging was acquired in the majority of patients (91%, n=122). There was a near even split for presence/abscence of an indication for delayed imaging on the portal venous phase imaging. There was no statistical correlation with an indication for delayed imaging and the acquisition of delayed imaging (p=0.475). When accounting for each indication independently, there was no statistical correlation between a specific indication and acquisition of delayed imaging. Conclusions: We found no correlation between indication for delayed-phase imaging and its acquisition in pediatric trauma patients at our Level I trauma center. Delayed phase imaging was obtained in the vast majority of these patients, irrespective of indication. Improving referral education and adoption of a protocol in which delayed imaging is only obtained in pediatric patients with appropriate indications could reduce the effective radiation dose to the pediatric trauma patients at our instition by 25%. Review of the literature corroborates these findings. Purpose or Case Report: Given the relative sensitivity of pediatric patients to radiation, the need to limit exposure to the region of interest is of the utmost importance in pediatric radiography. This study assesses the practice of acquiring pediatric chest radiographs at a community hospital in which the imaging contract was acquired by a radiology practice with subspecialty-certified pediatric radiologists. Pediatric radiologists in the new radiology practice saw a need for improved collimation of pediatric chest radiographs at the community hospital. Many radiographs exhibited poor collimation and included much of the abdomen. This study examines an initiative to measure and improve radiograph quality. Methods & Materials: All pediatric chest radiographs (n = 50, average age 5.6 years) obtained at the community hospital during 4 consecutive weeks were reviewed. The following Disclosures: All authors have disclosed no financial interests, arrangements or affiliations in the context of this activity.Purpose or Case Report: Congenital high airway obstruction syndrome (CHAOS) is a rare life-threatening disease and prenatal diagnosis is essential. Some characteristic features seen on fetal MRI are well-known: primary lesion (upper airway obstruction) and secondary changes (dilated trachea, flattened/inverted diaphragm, enlarged and hyperintense lung). It is also reported that these secondary changes may be reduced if tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) is present. The aim of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of fetal MRI in the prenatal diagnosis of CHAOS by comparing results with those of normal fetuses.",

The fetuses with CHAOS were selected from among those who were diagnosed at our institution from 2006 to 2018 (four CHAOS fetuses with TEF were also included), and the normal fetuses were selected from consecutive fetal MRI performed in 2017 and 2018. Identification of the upper airway was evaluated in both groups (false negative rate [FNR] in the CHAOS group and false positive rate [FPR] in the control group). Measurement of tracheal diameter (TD), craniocaudal/antero-posterior ratio in the right diaphragm (CC/APR), cardiothoracic ratio (CTR), and lung-to-liver signal intensity ratio (LLSIR) were also carried out in both groups. For comparison between the CHAOS group and the control group, a t-test was used. Also, CHAOS fetuses with TEF were evaluated in the same way as described above. Results: Upper airway obstruction could be detected in all fetuses with CHAOS (FNR=0%), while the upper airway could not be clearly identified in five fetuses in the normal group (FPR=13.5%). There was no statistical difference in TD (3.6\u00b11.0 mm, 3.2 mm\u00b10.5 mm, p=0.13) and LLSIR (2.64\u00b10.68, 2.54\u00b10.66, p=0.35) between the CHAOS group and the control group.

Methods & Materials: REB approved retrospective single centre observational study of port-a-caths placed by Interventional Radiology (IR), in CMC with neurological impairment, to meet their general vascular access needs. Details of peripheral intravenous (PIV) attempts, PIV successful starts, PIV complications, alternative devices, port-a-cath insertions, dwell times, times accessed, and port-a-cath-related complications were analyzed. Information for the year pre-porta-cath was compared to the year post-port-a-cath in 21 patients (10M; 11F). The Wilcoxon signed ranks test were performed by SPSS. Results: 21 patients underwent 26 port-a-cath insertions (median age 3 years; median weight 12.7 kg). The median porta-cath dwell time was 26.5 months, total number of port-a-cath dwell days was 31,632 and total number of days accessed was 1,066 (median 21/pt). There was a significant reduction (p<0.05) in number of PIV attempts, PIV starts, needle pokes, ED visits and admissions in year the post-port-a-cath compared to pre-port-a-cath. There was no severe adverse events, 6 moderate and 18 mild adverse events. Limitations of the study include its retrospective design, lack of scores for difficult IV access or scales for IV infiltration and extravasation. Conclusions: Port-a-cath placement in CMC significantly reduced the number of PIV attempts, needle pokes and admission requirements with no major added complications. These results provide useful information for parents and health care providers considering port-a-cath placement in this population. Purpose or Case Report: Stenosis of the inferior vena cava or the hepatic veins is an underlying cause for hepatic compromise in liver transplant patients and in patients with inflammatory diseases of the liver, leading to considerable morbidity. CTguided or ultrasound-guided minimally invasive vessel recanalization procedures can reverse liver failure in these patients by restoring vessel patency. However, it can be difficult to employ these techniques using traditional guidewire tips against fibrotic obstructions associated with vessels that have undergone repeated stenosis. Sharp recanalization offers an alternative strategy to gain access through these obstacles by utilizing needles or the sharp end of the guidewire tip to penetrate the vessel obstruction. This technique has been welldescribed and employed successfully in adult patients, but has not yet been reported in the pediatric setting. Results: Here, we present 3 cases of image-guided hepatic vein sharp recanalization in pediatric patients, one of whom required stent placement for recurrent venous stenotic obstructions of the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins. We were able to restore hepatic vein patency in all three patients with no acute or longterm complications. Two of the patients had undergone previous liver transplants, and in following the durability of the venous recanalization in these patients, we observed long-term extension of liver graft life to the extent of at least 18 months and 38 months, respectively.",

Purpose or Case Report: Percutaneous CT-guided biopsy and ablation are established techniques to diagnose and treat solid tumors. However, some tumors are not adequately visualized with CT, even after IV contrast administration, because of transient enhancement. Many of these \"CT-occult\" tumors are optimally seen on preprocedural MRI or PET scans. To enable targeting of such tumors, we developed software that fuses MRI/PET images to intraprocedural CT in real time. The software corrects for soft-tissue deformations which occur due to differences in patient positioning or motion. The fusion imaging is generated after each intraprocedural CT scan and takes advantage of all available imaging data.

            "text": "The software was tested on four patients with CT-occult tumors undergoing biopsy. Two patients had bone lesions (Salmonella osteomyelitis and Ewing Sarcoma) that were optimally visualized on preprocedural MRI and PET. Two patients with neurofibromatosis had soft-tissue lesions with regions that were suspicious for malignant transformation best seen on preprocedural MRI and PET. During biopsy, CT images were pushed from the scanner to the workstation and fused with the corresponding MRI or PET. The time and accuracy of image fusion were measured. Accuracy was measured as target registration error (TRE) at anatomic landmarks identified by an expert in individual images while blinded to the fusion images. Results: Clinical experts reviewed the fusion images after the procedures and judged them to be visually adequate and accurate. The mean TRE of 4.1 mm supported this finding. The TRE data further showed that the algorithm achieved subvoxel registration accuracy (registration error < voxel size) of 0.85 voxels, averaged over all four cases. The mean time of image data transfer from CT scanner to the fusion workstation was 2.0 s for volumetric and 0.4 s for fluoroscopic scans. The mean time to perform image fusion was 35.7 s for volumetric scans and 7.0 s for fluoroscopic scans. Conclusions: The image fusion software was fast and allowed accurate visualization of MRI/PET visible tumors on the intraprocedural CT images. When fully integrated in the IR workflow, this tool has the potential to provide improve targeting of CT-occult tumors and improve efficiency and efficacy for CT-guided biopsy and ablation. A prospective clinical trial is planned to quantify the anticipated clinical benefits.Disclosures: All authors have disclosed no financial interests, arrangements or affiliations in the context of this activity.Purpose or Case Report: There is limited understanding and utilization of dynamic contrast enhancement MRI of marrow, periosteum and cartilage for diagnosis of musculoskeletal (MSK) disease in children. This is partly due to limited availability of pediatric disease models of marrow inflammation, infection, infiltration, or involvement by tumor. Herein we explore signal intensity time curves of relevant MSK targets using a 3D Golden-angle RAdial Sparse Parallel (GRASP) MRI technique. GRASP is an accelerated, freebreathing dynamic acquisition that has been shown to reduce the need for sedation. We aim to establish a baseline for normal enhancement characteristics of marrow, cartilage, synovium and periosteum of the growing skeleton in a sheep model as a precursor to translation to children. Methods & Materials: GRASP data were acquired in 4 sheep using standard dose gadobutrol at 3 mL/sec. All studies were performed on a 3T system. GRASP data are acquired with consecutive radial spokes that are rotated by the golden angle. The data can be reconstructed into time-resolved dynamic frames with user-selectable temporal resolution during contrast passage (https://cai2r.net/research/radial-vibe-sequence). We reconstructed at a temporal resolution of 4.5s. Signal intensity curves were generated from regions-of-interests in: marrow of diaphysis, metaphysis, and epiphysis of the humerus, proximal humeral physis, periosteum of the proximal humerus, a thoracic vertebral body and an adjacent intervertebral disc. Results: A sample data set is here https://www.dropbox.com/s/zmh5dakn847s6w0/20180727.mov All structures exhibited onset of contrast-enhancement within approximately the same time frame after contrast administration, with a time to peak signal of <10s and with little washout over 180 seconds. There was no difference in the slope of wash-in and wash-out. However, the peak signal varied by anatomy. Specifically, signal in the diaphyseal marrow increased from 16% to 31% above baseline; metaphyseal marrow: 56% to 246%; physis: 155% to 206%; epiphyseal marrow: 54% to 96%; periosteum: 62% to 339%; intervertebral disc: 65% to 118%; and vertebral body: 155% to 321%. Conclusions: GRASP allows rapid free-breathing characterization of contrast ehancement in the growing skeleton. It provides excellent anatomic delineation and can potentially demonstrate difference in peak signal between relevant MSK targets. We hope to translate our technique to children, and utilize it for qualitative and quantitative diagnosis of pediatric MSK disease. Purpose or Case Report: To date, a standard for CRD has not been established. Plain radiographs are a cost-effective, low-risk option for studying osseous structures in great detail. It is well known that bone age is superior to chronological age for determining biological and structural maturity; for decades, pediatricians have relied on plain films of the wrist and hand for assessing bone age in children (e.g. Greulich & Pyle Atlas, Tanner Whitehouse Method). However, some have proposed new approaches with greater accuracy and reliability across all ages and ethnic groups. Here, we present a new standardized radiographic dimension, CRD, as a tool to assess developmental maturity, which can be readily obtained from standard medical imaging platforms. Methods & Materials: X-rays of the elbow were systematically searched in the electronic medical record at a single institution from a 15-month period (June 1, 2017 -Sept 30, 2018). Inclusion criteria included patients <18 years of age with plain films in anteroposterior (AP) and lateral views. Patients with radial head dislocation, displaced supracondylar fractures, or a history of dysplasia were excluded. Follow up images were also excluded. CRD values, measured as closest linear distance from the humeral capitellum to the radial head, were measured by a staff radiologist. P-values <0.5 using a two-tailed Student's ttest were deemed to be statisticallysignificant. Results: 75 patients ages 3 months to 18 years were included in the study. 45 were male (mean age=10 yrs, range=24 mo-18 yrs) and 29 were female (mean age=9 yrs, range=3 mo-17 yrs).CRD decreased with age, with the most significant drop off observed after age 5, when most patients developed a radial head ossification center. Mean AP CRD for ages 5 and below was 7.25 mm [SD \u00b11.54 mm], while mean AP CRD for ages 6 and above was 3.41 mm [SD \u00b10.81 mm] (P <0.0001). Conclusions: The standard for determining developing skeletal maturity has historically involved X-rays of the hand and wrist. However, these methods have shown inconsistency across certain age groups and ethnic groups. Here, we present another radiographic measurement to aid in the determination of skeletal maturity. CRD proves to have a strong negative curvilinear relationship with increasing age, particularly from ages 3 months to 5 years, before many healthy patients have developed a radial head ossification center and thus demonstrate largest CRD values. Knowledge of this measurement will aid diagnosis of radial head subluxation. (n=1)] were reviewed retrospectively. Results: Most common presenting symptoms were soft tissue swelling and pain (n=13, 65%) while fever was accompanied only in three patients (15%). Median duration of symptom was 1 month (range: 2 days-3 months). Leukocytosis and elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP, > 0.5 mg/dL) were depicted in three (15%) and seven patients (35%), respectively. Sixteen children (80%) received Tokyo-172 vaccine by percutaneous multiple puncture method, three (15%) and one (5%) received intradermal Tokyo-172 and Danish strain, respectively. Distal femur (n=7) was the most frequently involved site followed by tarsal bones (n=4), proximal tibia (n=2), distal humerus (n=1), distal radius (n=1), sternum (n=1), rib (n=1) and proximal phalanx of big toe (n=1). Epiphyseal involvement of the long tubular bones were seen in seven patients (35%). Multiple bone lesions were depicted in two patients. Plain radiography showed ill-defined osteolytic lesion with cortical disruption in 13 patients. MRI showed central necrosis in the involved marrow cavity with cortical destruction and cold abscess formation in 14 patients (70 %). Surgical drainage was performed in 19 patients (95%), and half of them required repeated surgical interventions due to recurrent infection. Antituberculosis medications were administered for a median duration of 12 months (range, 12-31 months). Conclusions: BCG osteitis in immunocompetent children is a rare but serious complication of BCG immunization. High level of suspicion of BCG osteitis based on clinical and radiological manifestations is important for early diagnosis and prompt management. Purpose or Case Report: Children with Duchene muscular dystrophy (DMD) have increased risk for osteoporosis and fragility fractures due to progressive muscle weakness with eventual loss of ambulation and chronic corticosteroid therapy. Their fracture prevalence is 40-60%, and increases with age. Bone Mineral Density (BMD) is not reflective of fracture risk. Recent studies showed that cortical thickness and area were associated with increased facture risk. Digital X-ray measurement of the cortical thickness of the metacarpal bones can be used as a marker for metacarpal cortical health. To our knowledge, this marker of bone health has not been evaluated in DMD patients. The purpose of this study was to assess bone age (BA), cortical thickness and area of metacarpal bones in relation to age in children with DMD.",

Automated determination of bone age, and cortical bone density expressed as Bone Health Index (BHI) were performed using BoneXpert (Visiana, Holte, Denmark). Validation of bone age from Bonexpert has been performed extensively before. Zscores were computed for bone age and BHI, and age-related changes were noted. Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) was calculated for each metric in comparison to age. Results: The mean z scores of bone age and BHI reduced significantly with age. Z-scores for BA and BHI were: 1) 5-8 years (n=7), BA:-0.51; BHI: -1.17; 2) 8-11 years (n=14), BA: -1.17; BHI: -1.78; 3) 11-15 years ( n=21), BA: -2.36; BHI: -1.745; 4) 15-17 years (n=4), BA:-3.77, BHI:-2.46. The Pearson's r = -0.47 for BA and r = -0.36 for BHI (reduces with age, p<0.005).

BHI may have values in assessment of bone health in children with DMD. The worsening BHI with increasing age may correlate with increased fracture risk that is known to increase over time due to disease progression and longer corticosteroid exposure. Future study is needed to determine the association of BHI and fracture risk.

The scans included both conventional sequences (T1, IR, PD, T2weighted and T1 fat suppressed postcontrast) for osteomyelitis as well as a 3-minute GRASP DCE sequence that we have been concurrently evaluating in a sheep model. CS were interpreted per clinical standards. GRASP was interpreted independently by 3 radiologists, blinded to CS, and scored with binary (y/n) answers for reporting elements in OM including marrow signal abnormality, synovitis, subperiosteal abscess, intraosseous abscess, soft tissue or muscle hypoenhancement, myositis, and cellulitis. Results: Average total exam time for CS protocol was 46.2 \u00b1 15.1 minutes. Average additional time for GRASP was 8 \u00b1 5.1 minutes including prescription and scanning. Average slice thickness was 3.2 mm for CS and 1.5 mm for GRASP. CS demonstrated marrow signal abnormality in 4 of 6 cases, attributed to OM in 3, with one case being posttraumatic. Synovitis (n=3), soft tissue hypoenhancement (n=3), myositis (n=2), and cellulitis (n=4) were also identified. There were no cases of intraosseous or subperiosteal abscess. Based on the average sensitivity and specificity of the 3 readers, GRASP was relatively sensitive (83%) and highly specific (100%) in detection of marrow signal abnormality, highly sensitive (100%) and specific (89%) for soft tissue or muscle hypoenhancement, and 100% sensitive and 67% specific for cellulitis. GRASP was less sensitive than CS for detection of synovitis (50%) and myositis (50%), with high specificity (100% and 92% respectively). Locations of disease were concordant across readers and consistent with CS. Conclusions: Based on preliminary data in this ongoing study, GRASP holds promise for replacing CS in the diagnosis of OM and ultimately reducing sedation. Further analysis is necessary to determine if the addition of a single precontrast fluid sensitive sequence and quantitative DCE curves may provide additional diagnostic benefit.",

Images were analyzed at sagittal lateral and medial MRI slices using a house-made MATLAB software. A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: We found statistically significant negative associations between age and T2 relaxation times of ankle cartilage, ranging from -0.91 (P < 0.001) to -0.66 (P = 0.03) for all image protocols. Furthermore, statistically significant negative trends of T2 relaxation times for ankle cartilage were found with increasing age, ranging from -2.08 ms/year (P = 0.006) to -0.80 ms/year (P < 0.01) for all image protocols. Similarly, mean T2 relaxation times were found upon using a constant TR/TE to other image protocols, thus enforcing the generalizability of the protocol. In contrast, weak associations were found between BMI and ankle cartilage T2 relaxation times. Conclusions: Age plays an important role in understanding cartilage T2 relaxation times.

The association between these variables and the presence or absence of hemorrhage on the HUS was analyzed using STATA 12.1. Results: Twenty-one percent (N=29/136) of neonates had an ICH on their HUS. Studies that were ordered with an indication related to hematocrit were less likely to have an ICH on HUS compared to those with alternative indications for the study (odds ratio 0.35, p=0.018). The mean change in hematocrit (p=0.95), a decrease in hematocrit (p=0.30), and an abnormal neurological examination (p=0.25) were not associated with ICH on HUS. However, a lower gestational age (mean difference 4.47, p<0.001) and number of days since birth (mean difference 25.1, p=0.01) were both significantly predictive of ICH. Those with an ICH were also three times more likely to be premature, though this association was only borderline significant (odds ratio 3.03. p=0.09).Conclusions: Diffusion weighted imaging had no impact on distant staging in our pediatric cohort, but may add value in local staging.

Patients with metastatic disease had higher ctDNA levels compared to nonmetastatic patients. ctDNA levels correlated with clinicalcourse and, in some cases, rising ctDNA levels predicted relapse, earlier than was clincally apparent by imaging studies. Conclusions: ctDNA analysis holds promise as an ultrasensitive and specific tool for monitoring tumor burden. Our assay was able to detect ctDNA in the plasma of metastatic and nonmetastatic pediatric sarcoma patients at diagnosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ctDNA levels correlated with clinical response to therapy. In some cases, ctDNA levels proved more sensitive than imaging, detecting minimal residual disease andpredicting relapse. Purpose or Case Report: Experience in pediatric nuclear medicine is limited and not uniform across residency and pediatric fellowship training programs. At our tertiary care pediatric hospital, emergent nuclear medicine exams performed after hours are currently read by radiologists with expertise in pediatric nuclear medicine. A decision to shift this responsibility to in-house faculty has prompted creation of a continuing medical education (CME) learning module as part of an institutional comprehensive learning management system (LMS). The goal of this module is to train faculty, fellows and residents in the indications, protocols, diagnostic criteria, potential pitfalls and problem-solving techniques when reading emergent pediatric nuclear medicine exams. The purpose of this study is to better understand the volume of nuclear medicine cases on-call and the potential need for a dedicated pediatric nuclear medicine curriculum. Methods & Materials: All nuclear medicine gastrointestinal bleeding scans, Meckel's scans, hepatobiliary scans for biliary leak or acute cholecystitis, brain death scans and renal transplant evaluations performed between July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2018 were reviewed. Exams ordered after 4:30 PM on weekdays or performed on weekends were considered call studies. Faculty were surveyed to assess length of time since reading each type of scan, as well as their level of comfort protocolling and interpreting studies. Results: Case review revealed 54 emergent pediatric nuclear medicine studies with 13 (24.1%) read after hours. Of all studies performed, 28.6% of gastrointestinal bleeding studies (n= 2/7), 16.7% of Meckel's scans (n= 5/30), 22.2% of brain death studies (n = 2/9), 33.3% renal transplant scan (n=1/3), 75.0% of acute cholecystitis scans (n=3/4) and 0% of biliary leak scans (n=0/1), were read on-call. 19 (70.4%) of 27 faculty members who take call completed the survey. At least 63.2% have not read any of these types of nuclear medicine study since residency/fellowship or not at all. The percentage of those uncomfortable protocoling studies ranges from 73.7% to 89.5%, greatest with renal scans. The percentage of those uncomfortable interpreting studies ranges from 47.4% to 84.2%, greatest with renal scans. Conclusions: Even in large academic centers, there is a limited number of radiologists with expertise in pediatric nuclear medicine, making call coverage challenging. There is a need for continued training to provide important emergent nuclear medicine studies for patients after hours. Purpose or Case Report: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of 3 Tesla lung magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in children with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA).",

From October 2015 to January 2018, we prospectively evaluated twenty-seven consecutive children with ABPA. The diagnosis of ABPA was made on the ISHAM-ABPA working group criteria. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and 3T MRI of the chest was performed on the same day. Bronchiectasis, consolidation, nodules, and mucus impaction were assessed in all segments. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of MRI were calculated using HRCT findings as the reference standard. Interobserver agreement was calculated using the kappa statistic. Results: The mean age of the patients was 9.89 years (range: 5-16 years). There were 20 males and 7 females. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for bronchiectasis was 68%, 100%, 100% and 71.43% respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for consolidation was 80%, 100%, 100% and 96% respectively. For detection of nodules, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV was 75%, 100%, 100% and 88.46% respectively. There was 100% sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for mucus impaction. There was a high degree of interobserver agreement for MRI findings (k=0.9-1) as well as agreement (k=0.7-1) between CT and MRI for all the four findings. Conclusions: With the currently available routine MR sequences, MRI demonstrates high specificity but less sensitivity and negative predictive value to HRCT scan in children with ABPA. Newer MR sequences need to be explored and validated to enhance the potential of lung MRI in ABPA.",

Eligiblity for inclusion were all consecutive children with pathologically proven thyroid carcinoma from 2008 to 2017. Patients with no preoperative US or no resected lymph nodes were excluded. Pathology report of lymphadenopathy was used as the gold standard. Size, shape, echotexture and vascularity of the lymph nodes were analyzed and compared to the pathology findings Results: We reviewed preoperative US and histology reports of resected lymph nodes in 52 children with proven thyroid carcinoma (33F,19M; age range 5-18y; mean 13y). Metastatic cervical lymph node disease was documented on US in 29 children and on histology in 33. Sensitivity of US was 79%, specificity 84%, PPV 90%, NPV 70% and accuracy 81%. A significant association was seen between round shape, echotexture, vascularity and lymph node histology. The measurements in short axis for the metastatic nodes was significantly higher than benign nodes (U=168.5,P=0.005, Mann-Whitney U test). No significant difference was noted between the groups in long axis. Logistic regression Univariate analysis showed that round shape (OR=0.054,95%CI=0.006-0.466), echotexture (OR=0.048,95%CI=0.01-0.234), vascularity (OR=0.025,95%CI=0.003-0.225) and short axis measurement (OR=1.473,95%CI=1.019-2.130) contribute significantly to make a positive diagnosis. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed only vascularity contributed significantly to explain the disease probability when adjusting for the other variables. Importantly, 11 patients (38% of children with metastatic disease documented on US) had US diagnosis of abnormal lymph nodes based solely on abnormal echogenicity and vascularity, with normal size and shape Conclusions: Neck US showed high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity for identifying malignant adenopathy in children with thyroid carcinoma. Most of the abnormal lymph nodes were round in shape and had abnormal echogenicity and vascularity. However, this paper emphasizes that metastatic nodes may be normal in size and shape and the abnormality may be based solely on abnormal echogenicity and vascularity. Size, particularly long axis measurement, is not a reliable criterion to differentiate between malignant and benign lymph nodes. This has not been reported previously in pediatrics Disclosures: All authors have disclosed no financial interests, arrangements or affiliations in the context of this activity. Purpose or Case Report: To prospectively investigate the diagnostic accuracy and added value of lung MRI for evaluating pulmonary hydatid disease in children by comparing MRI findings with MDCT findings. Methods & Materials: 28 consecutive children with clinically suspected of having pulmonary hydatid disease were enrolled in this prospective research study from October, 2012 to July, 2018. In all 28 pediatric patients (24 boys, 4 girls; mean age, 8.93 +/-3.1 years; range, 5 to 17) were included in this study, MRI without contrast and enhanced MDCT of the chest were performed within 48 hours of each other. Two pediatric radiologists independently evaluated the lungs for the presence 3 mm, corroborating the ultrasound findings and confirming the diagnosis of SMA syndrome. The patient was initiated on nutritional support and at most recent follow-up was responding well to conservative treatments. Conclusions: Knowledge of the imaging findings of this rare disorder can provide early diagnostic capabilities and lead to more effective treatment plans. Purpose or Case Report: Gadolinium, a type of MRI contrast is typically used when imaging pediatric cardiac patients. Gadolinium enhances the images to give more clarity to the radiologists when distinguishing normal tissue from abnormal tissue. Further, contrast also allows for better visualization of the great vessels.Gadolinium alters the magnetic properties of nearby water molecules in the tissue. While contrast itself does not alter the tissue composition, it does affect how the scanner takes the picture. Accordingly, images can differ between preand post-contrast administration. While IV contrast can be administered safely, it is not without logistic implications and/or risks.MRI contrast can be given to pediatric cardiac patients intravenously, but IV access is oftentimes challenging in pediatric cardiac patients. In an effort to reduce the number of unsuccessful IV attempts and quantity of contrast administered, a novel non-contrast MR sequences is being utilized to better depict the great vessels in these children. If IV access is unsucessful or the patient cannot complete the MRI, this modality is employed to obtain more information on the patient's cardiact vasculature.This purpose of this case report paper is to show the MR imaging when using a non-contrast sequence to identify cardiac vessels in pediatric patients who cannot recieve IV contrast.",

Examination shows no evidence of hernia or incarceration. Results: Additional diagnostic sonography imaging demonstrated progression of inflammatory condition within the right scrotal and inguinal area. The right epididymis presented edematous, hyperemic, and heterogenous with surrounding soft tissue edema and scrotal wall thickening. Flow to the right testical was preserved however, the inflammation affected the orientation of the right testical in the scrotal sac. Conclusions: This case highlights the difficulty in clearly identifying pathology for acute testicular pain in a pediatric patient without known trauma. Purpose or Case Report: Imaging requisitions are the legal documents that health professionals use to communicate to radiologists and Medical Radiation Technologists (MRT(R)s) the relevant clinical information to guide their requested radiographic examination. Inadequate or incomplete information may have a substantial impact on patient care.Since the implementation of our electronic medical record system, EPIC (Epic Systems Corp.), we have the ability to track the number of errors on requisitions; the most common error is having the incorrect body parts selected or multiple unnecessary exams being ordered. The MRT(R)'s identify these errors and correct the inconsistencies following departmental protocols. Without such vigilance on the MRT(R)'s part, inappropriate radiographs could have been performed and could lead to additional, unnecessary radiation exposure. To help select the most appropriate protocol, educate and guide the health professionals at our hospital, an electronic software tool, \"EDI\" has been created.EDI (Examine the patient, Determine the correct radiograph, Input the order with pertinent and relevant clinical information) is an interactive tool that includes the exam protocol with the associated views per body part. Each exam also includes EDI with the field of view that will be exposed to radiation during the exam.Our goal is that EDI will serve health professionals to better understand what order needs to be selected in the electronic system and which radiographs will be provided. Ultimately, this will reduce any unnecessary exams and reduce pediatric radiation exposure. Purpose or Case Report: Purpose: The long-term effects from gadolinium tissue deposition in organs and the brain is unknown especially in children who may need repeated contrast studies for necessary follow-up of cardiovascular abnormalities. We aim to show the utility of a non-contrast MRA sequence in older children and young adults undergoing chest and/or abdominal MRA. Methods & Materials: Methods: We retrospectively review the utility of non-contrast navigator-triggered and ECG-gated 3D steady-state free precession (SSFP) imaging of the chest and abdomen generally acquired in the coronal plane performed for evaluation of cardiovascular abnormalities. Results: Results: When acquired during diastole to limit the amount of turbulent flow, non-contrast 3D SSFP imaging is successful in all patients who are able to remain still with regular breathing rates. The studies are diagnostic in over 90% of all older children and young adults with non-diagnostic imaging only occurring when there is substantial flow turbulence related to vascular or valve stenosis. The pulmonary veins are also occasionally not well visualized. There can be substantial artifact in younger children. A contrast-enhanced study should be performed following a non-diagnostic noncontrast study which will occur in a small percentage of older children and young adult patients. Conclusions: Conclusions: Gadolinium based contrast can be eliminated for most chest and abdomen MRA studies in older children and young adults. ",

Correlation was made with follow up radiology studies, clinical and/or surgical outcomes.Necrotizing enterocolitis, inflammatory bowel disease, infectious colitis, neutropenic enterocolitis, malrotation, short bowel syndrome, appendicitis, intussusception, Meckel's diverticulitis, intestinal polyp, vascular malformations, graft versus host disease, intestinal hemorrhage, perforation, and obstruction will be discussed. Results: Typical findings in normal and abnormal pediatric bowel exams will be illustrated. Emphasis on appropriate technique and methodology for serial examinations will be described.Conclusions: Through this exhibit, participants will learn to utilize bowel ultrasound as a powerful tool in evaluating pediatric gastrointestinal diseases and understand how to optimize their technique. Purpose or Case Report: Ultrasound has become a powerful tool for the evaluation of bowel pathology in the children. In the newborn, ultrasound (US) can be used to diagnose, stage, and follow up necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and its complication. US has excellent sensitivity and specificity for the identification of bowel wall thickening, peristalsis, pneumatosis, portal venous gas and free air and has become an integral evaluation tool for the newborn with abdominal distention. Our educational poster will:1. Summarize proper US equipment, technique and protocol for diagnosing and following up NEC2. Discuss advantages and benefits of incorporating US in the evaluation of bowel in newborns3. Illustrate the sonographic findings of mild, moderate and severe NEC through cases Methods & Materials: Pictorial review of US findings of NEC including grayscale and color Doppler. Comparison is made to similar findings in radiographs and clinical correlation. Results: The spectrum of normal and abnormal neonatal bowel US findings are presented. Abnormal findings are presented using illustrative cases. Conclusions: Ultrasound is a powerful tool that supplements and at times can replaced more traditional diagnostic methods in the assessment of NEC. This educational exhibit provides a practical guide for systematic evaluation of bowel in the newborn and how to diagnose, stage and follow up NEC and its complications. Purpose or Case Report: In 2016, we focused on MRI safety and the inherent cultural barriers to reduce the risk of undetected or misplaced metal objects causing MRI accidents. We successfully addressed this opportunity using a coordinated approach with Patient Safety, Performance Improvement and Radiology Leadership to provide a multi-faceted solution.Despite implementation of ferromagnetic detection systems (FMDS) technology, numerous gaps in screening effectiveness were identified. Three primary improvement objectives were established involving place, people and process leading to 42 new practice changes that were implemented, and 68 existing process improvements instituted. Alarm fatigue was one among many identified risks. Variables included the physical location of the projectile on the transport person, as well as the horizontal or vertical orientation of potential hazard while being carried were identified during a series of nine standardized PDSA testing sessions that were completed in the clinical setting.",

Treatment of JIA largely depends on frequently managing inflammation within the joints, and as such, ultrasound is a prime imaging modality that can be used for detection and monitoring of inflammation. Ultrasound is more sensitive than plain films in the early detection of JIA, and ultrasound is more sensitive than clinical examinations alone. As a low-cost, high-resolution imaging modality, ultrasound allows visualization of the joint spaces, can be used to detect joint effusions, and can monitor synovial proliferation and joint hyperemia, all while not exposing the patient to radiation. We will present ultrasound images of various joints in children such as knees, ankles, wrists, hands and feet. Ultrasound technique, imaging planes, choice of probes frequencies and ultrasound settings are analyzed for optimization of the images. This presentation will highlight the diagnostic imaging findings of JIA on ultrasound, such the presence of joint effusions, synovial proliferation, capsular thickening, tendinitis as well as provide information on common pitfalls associated with age-specific appearances of pediatric musculoskeletal structures on ultrasound. Familiarity with JIA and musculoskeletal ultrasound findings will allow timely diagnosis and implementation of appropriate treatment strategies. Purpose or Case Report: The MAGEC System is a surgical treatment for children with severe spinal deformities. The system utilizes surgically implanted rods, which are periodically extended by an External Remote Control (ERC). The traditional method to measure lengthening progression involved radiation exposure. Ultrasound provides an immediate evaluation with no bio-effects. Additionally, soft tissue changes incurred by rod implantation can be seen, which is difficult to assess with a radiograph. The sonographer acquires both pre-and postlengthening measurements before and after the ERC is applied to the child's skin at the level of the rods. The entire process can be completed in minutes within a single outpatient room, for the ease of both patient and parent. Methods & Materials: Children with scoliosis too severe for bracing or casting and too young for spinal fusion, have been traditionally managed with growing rods. This involves repeated surgical elongation, often requiring ten or more surgeries before the child reaches skeletal maturity.MAGEC rods require initial implantation surgery and are expanded with the use of an externally applied ERC. The sonographer scans each rod, measuring the pre-lengthening measurement. The physician utilizes the ERC to externally manipulate the MAGEC rods. The sonographer scans the child again, and can determine if the rods have been sufficiently extended. Additional ERC applications, if necessary, can then be employed. Results: Ultrasound has proven to be a useful tool in the measurement of MAGEC rod extension in patients with severe spinal deformities. It can easily be performed within the examination room in conjunction with the application of the ERC. Conclusions: The use of ultrasound to measure the lengthening of MAGEC rods minimizes radiation exposure, decreases the need for repeated surgeries, and allows for soft tissue evaluation. It streamlines the process of obtaining measurements and can be utilized in one room within an outpatient setting, simplifying the encounter for patient and family.",

The utility and clinical value of dynamic sonographic evaluation of the glenohumeral joint in infants with brachial plexus injury (BPBI) has been described since the late 1990's. However, this technique remains an underutilized tool in most imaging practices. Brachial plexus injury during the birthing process can lead to glenoid dysplasia, posterior shoulder subluxation and significant morbidity if left untreated. Imaging evaluation of the degree of deformity is paramount to guide clinical treatment and the follow-up of complicated cases. Imaging techniques include MRI, CT and US. Shoulder ultrasound provides a dynamic, noninvasive method of evaluation. It has also been our experience that this imaging technique can be mastered by the Sonographer and supported with accurate interpretation by the Radiologist.Purpose:Describe the imaging features of glenohumeral joint dysplasia due to BPBI with emphasis on ultrasound technique.Review step-by-step dynamic sonographic evaluation of the glenohumeral joint in BPBI with emphasis on correct positioning of the patient to ensure consistency and reproducible quality imaging.Improve both confidence and independent evaluation of patients through this presentation by the sonographer.",

Different factors affect bone health, such as genetics and family history, diet and exercise, certain medications, and whether a patient is ambulatory or non-ambulatory. It is important to conduct the proper testing to determine a patient's fracture risk and trying to prevent further bone deterioration.

We employ several different techniques and distractions tools to help the patient cope soundly through the exam. We work closely with the Hematology department staff and have developed a TCD task force specifically focused for this age group to increase our success rate. Some of the strategies we employ are as follows: arranging the ultrasound room so that the patient is able to view the television to watch a favorite show or program, letting the child play games on smart phones or tablets (without too much patient movement), having a parent or guardian lying with or holding the patient, sitting the patient up slightly, blowing bubbles, singing, having hand held musical or light up toys available and/or arranging to have a child life specialist present for the duration of the exam to help distract the patient. We have also produced a short informational video for new patients to view prior to coming to their first TCD exam so they can see what to expect. Results: By having several options in place and available, by planning ahead and having resilient, dedicated sonographers we are able to successfully perform TCDs on younger and younger patients thereby facilitating more positive outcomes for this patient population. Conclusions: Transcranial Doppler ultrasound is a low cost, easy to perform with dedicated practice, portable, radiation-free modality that with set parameters in place can be extremely successful in imaging younger patients.
