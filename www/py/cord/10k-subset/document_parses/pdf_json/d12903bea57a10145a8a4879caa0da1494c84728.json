Outcomes in patients with possible LRTD were similar to that of URTI. Our study also defined important clinical risk factors associated with poor outcomes of PIV LRTD, including oxygen requirement at diagnosis, low monocyte count, and steroid use >2 mg/kg/day. Numerous studies of respiratory viruses in immunocompromised hosts have examined LRTD either as an endpoint or a risk factor for mortality. However, previously published results for both the incidence and risk factors for progression and outcome vary widely [3-6, 11, 12] . Data presented here suggest that the variance in definitions of LRTD is one important reason for the observed differences. To address this issue, we conducted the present study to define the optimized diagnostic criteria that correlate with outcome. Based on the site of virologic detection and clinical manifestations, we classified LRTD into 3 groups ( possible, probable, and proven). The recently published Fourth European Conference on Infections in Leukaemia (ECIL-4) guidelines also proposed a classification based on levels of certainty ( possible, probable, confirmed) [15] . However, the ECIL-4 classification is for all respiratory viruses, applies to both UTRI and LRTD, and uses symptoms, exposure, and any viral detection (independent of site) as classifiers. In contrast, our classification is strictly among LRTD cases that were all virologically confirmed [15] . In our paper, we specifically focused on the \"possible\" category, which includes patients with nasopharyngeal tests demonstrating PIV infection and abnormal chest radiography, but without confirmation of virus in the lower respiratory tract. Numerous publications as well as society guidelines have generally accepted that these patients have LRTD [5-8, 11, 15-19] . Our data demonstrate that the mortality in patients with possible LRTD is significantly better than that in patients with probable and proven disease ( Figure 1C and 1D) and similar to that of patients with URTI ( Table 2 ). The effect was persistent throughout the study period (data not shown). Interestingly, possible LRTD patients without symptoms tended to have even better outcome than URTI (Supplementary Figure 1) . Nevertheless, many studies include this category as LRTD [6-8, 16, 17] . Therefore, we suggest that this group we defined as \"possible\" LRTD should be separated from the patient group with viral detection in the lung ( proven and probable LRTD cases). We developed our definitions a priori based on clinical practices across centers and the spectrum of definitions used in the literature. The \"possible\" and \"proven\" categories are by far the most common categories documented, both in our series and elsewhere.

Although our study focused on patients infected with PIV, we hypothesize that the outcome differences seen among the \"possible\" disease category may also exist for other respiratory viruses. Indeed, most studies and guidelines of non-PIV respiratory viruses include \"possible\" cases in their definitions of LRTD [7, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Additional studies are needed to extend these results to other respiratory virus infections. More than a decade ago, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) established the standard definitions for invasive fungal disease [20, 21] . These guidelines are widely accepted [22, 23] , and resulted in improved reproducibility of study results between centers. These guidelines have greatly aided consensus endpoint definitions for clinical trials in invasive fungal disease.
