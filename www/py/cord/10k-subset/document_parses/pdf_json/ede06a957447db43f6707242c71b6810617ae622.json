The fast sharing of 2019-nCoV genomes in GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org) provides a valuable dataset for 2019-nCoV haplotype network analysis, which is crucial for transmission and evolutionary track surveillance and secondary outbreak prevention.",

We found the 2019-nCoV haplotype network has obvious characteristics of single origin from haplotype hap_011: first, the network is star-like, centralized on the haplotype hap_011; second, hap_011 has the largest sample size and majority of the samples are from Hubei province-where outbreak originated (Tab. S1); third, most of satellite haplotypes are also from Hubei (Fig. 1) ; fourth, the average collection dates of hap_011 (has 0 mutation relative to MN908947) is earlier than all other mutation groups (Fig. S1 ). The single origin of 2019-nCov indicates a persistent animal to human transmission is unlikely, otherwise, multiple nodes with above characteristics should be observed.",

            "text": "We found five haplotypes (hap_009, hap_017, hap_023, hap_048 and hap_050) forming loops ( Fig. 1) , which typically indicate existing of genetic recombination. However, in rare cases, loops can also be formed by recurring sequencing error or parallel/back mutations. Further examination of the differences pattern among the five haplotypes found three sets of recurrent differences: C29095T, G11083T and C8782T/T28144C (Fig. 1) , most of which are nonsynonymous changes except C29095T (Tab. S2). Such highly frequent recurrent differences looks extremely unlikely raised by rare events like recurring sequencing error/mutations. To quantify the significance of recombination over recurring sequencing error/mutations, Phi [6] and Max Chi-squared tests [7] in the software PhiPack [8] were performed. It showed p-values of 0.03 and 0.005 for Phi and Max Chi-squared, respectively, indicating the presence of recombinants in 2019-nCoV population. 3 Since all the haplotypes originate from hap_011, the formation mechanisms of the five haplotypes could be inferred as follow: First, hap_048 and hap_050 mutated from the common ancestry hap_011 independently, hap_009 then mutated from hap_050; next, hap_048 donated the genome region harboring 11083T to hap_050 generated the recombinant hap_017; similarly, hap_048 or hap_017 donated the same region to hap_009 generated the recombinant hap_023 susceptibility directly from other strains [12, 13] ; the adaptability of 2019-nCoV to human immune system might be significantly strengthened through genetic recombination; the accuracy of diagnosis based on serologic and molecular biology assays might be compromised [14] ; and the transmission tracking based on phylogenetics tree could be misleading since the topology of mutation route is a network rather than a tree.",

It is anticipated since all these studies adopted region-wise phylogenetics analysis which cannot efficiently detect recent recombination events like haplotype network does. However, the recombination region they found in bat coronavirus is quite close to the 2019-nCoV recombination site 11083 (harbored by gene ORF1a) found in this report. This consistency of the ancient and the recent recombination analysis solidifies both our findings and prompts potential recombination hotspots existing around region 11083-20953 or gene ORF1a/ORF1b. This report provides the first evidence for genetic recombination-a new way of evolution besides mutation in 2019-nCoV. The existing of genetic recombination has the following implications: two different 2019-nCoV strains (here, hap_048 and hap_050) should have coinfected the same cell; a 2019-nCoV strain might acquire new traits like virulence and drug",
