For example, if we study the disease syndrome of croup, acute laryngotracheobronchitis in children, we find that parainfluenza viruses and influenza viruses are the most important etiologic agents, accounting for a great many such cases. But exactly what we find depends on other things too-season, for example. In Britain, for instance, parainfluenza 2 is not prevalent every year, although when it occurs it is, as Dr. Chanock said when he discovered it, a croup-associated virus.

There seemed to be 2 possibilities. One was that, in fact, only 30% of the people excreted viruses when they were infected with them. The other possibility was that our techniques were not sufficiently sensitive and that the remaining 70% of the specimens contained viruses that would not grow in the cultures that we were using, although we had made them as sensitive as we could for the viruses that we knew about.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "From the Common Cold Unit, Medical Research"}, {"text": "In order to distinguish between these 2 possibilities, we were very fortunate in having at hand the ideal test situation for a respiratory virus, namely, volunteers at the Harvard Hospital, established originally as the American Red Cross Hospital, near Salisbury, and since the war adapted to become the Common Cold Research Unit (figure 3) . The volunteers are kept in isolation for about 10 days and are inoculated with intranasal drops after a preliminary quarantine period of about 3 days. They remain in their rooms or away from other volunteers, after being inoculated, and about 30% of those given infectious fluids develop colds. We took some of the 70% of washings from which we could not recover virus and gave them to groups of volunteers, and immediately it a plastic petri dish, the surface scratched with a scalpel and planted with small squares of respiratory epithelium, tracheal or nasal.

Figure 5 shows the result of a typical experiment, in which nasal secretions containing a small amount of infectious influenza B virus were dropped onto such a culture 2 days after it had been put up, and the amount of virus in the medium was titrated at intervals thereafter. There was over a 100-fold increase in virus in the next 24 hr. This titer declined gradually, and in about 9 or 10 days it was obvious that something was wrong. The ciliated epithelium was no longer seen to be beating when the cultures were examined by reflected light with a low-power microscope. Sections of the cultures showed degeneration.

The type of degenerative change is almost indistinguishable from that seen either in the cells of a tissue culture infected with adeno- became clear that these materials contained viruses that could cause colds. We were forced to the conclusion, therefore, that the tissue cultures were not adequate technically, and the general thought was that there would be better success if we could use ciliated respiratory epithelium-in fact, the sort of cells in which the viruses must multiply when they cause a cold. Fortunately, Dr. Hoorn of the University of Lund had modified a technique originally described by Fell many years before at the Strangeways Laboratory, and now commonly called organ culture. We use it to culture not whole organs but small bits of tissue. Figure 4 shows the sort of technique that he finally adopted: virus or in the lung of a patient dying from adenovirus pneumonia.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 129, "end": 137, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 750, "end": 758, "text": "Figure 6", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}, {"start": 1603, "end": 1611, "text": "Figure 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "From the Common Cold Unit, Medical Research"}, {"text": "After a series of such experiments it was possible to make the generalization that any respiratory virus-any virus, that is, which is known to multiply in respiratory epithelium-would multiply in organ cultures of this sort, and furthermore that not only laboratory strains of virus would multiply, but also strains obtained in the form of clinical specimens. Furthermore, these i organ cultures were extremely sensitive. We could sometimes detect influenza virus more readily by inoculation of organ culture than of eggs, which are more frequently used. We noted one other thing: that this one system would allow the multiplication of a great variety of viruses. With the ordinary method of isolation, one has to use a number of different systemsdifferent cells and different media-in order to grow different groups of viruses. We were therefore tempted to say, \"This looks rather like the universal culture for respiratory viruses. Isn't it worth, therefore, seeing if we can cultivate with this system some of the respiratory viruses which have hitherto eluded us?\" Therefore we proceeded along 2 parallel lines. The first was that conducted by Dr. Hoorn. He took some specimens from his nose when he had his first cold after he got back to Sweden. This specimen turned out to be very interesting, because from it he could isolate no virus in tissue culture; therefore, he put it into ciliated epithelium of human origin, obtained from embryos and put up in organ culture, and with the sort of lucky chance that sometimes occurs, the cilia stopped beating 4 or 5 days later. He found that this was because a virus was multiplying and that this was just as precise a way of detecting its pres- ence as a cytopathic effect would be in an ordinary tissue culture. Figure 7 shows why the cilia stopped beating. The surface epithelial cells were completely shed. Even if the cultures are kept going much longer, the remaining cells are not destroyed. This virus has only a limited capacity to multiply. It must be supremely cell-specific and host-specific because apparently it can only destroy ciliated epithelial cells of human respiratory mucosa. It cannot multiply in any other form of cell, as Dr. Hoorn's work showed; mucosa of other species or other sorts of human cells will not support growth as determined by back-titration in ciliated cells of this sort. Furthermore, he showed that this virus had quite characteristic properties, that if passed through a relatively tight filter (50 mu, average pore diameter), it was acid-labile, that it was ether-stable, and that it would multiply at 33 C and not at 37 C. People infected with it developed antibodies, but it was not neutralized by serum against any known respiratory virus and in particular not by any known rhinovirus; this virus was, therefore, a rhinovirus of a new serological and biological type (HS).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1764, "end": 1772, "text": "Figure 7", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}], "section": "From the Common Cold Unit, Medical Research"}, {"text": "We concluded from this work that the organ culture technique would allow rhinoviruses that could not be grown in any other medium to grow and be detected.

Are we missing many viruses in this way?\" I think the answer is rather interesting.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "From the Common Cold Unit, Medical Research"}, {"text": "We have in fact found rather few rhinoviruses that cannot be persuaded to grow in tissue cultures, at least in our laboratory. However, what we have found is that this organ culture system is a most useful, \"enrichment\" medium for their cultivation from clinical specimens. If one takes clinical specimens, puts them into organ cultures, passes the organ culture fluid once or twice, and then puts them back into tissue cultures, one may double the rate of rhinovirus isolation. This work has been confirmed by Dr. Higgins in Cirencester. How much improvement is made must, of course, depend on how good the tissue cultures may be, but there is no doubt that it is a cumbersome, inconvenient method. However, some years ago Harnett and Hooper suggested that one might do almost as well by taking a small piece of respiratory epithelium, dropping it into a milliliter of culture medium in a test tube, and using that instead of the elaborate organ cultures. In fact, this seems to be correct. A visiting worker, Dr. Votava from Czechoslovakia, studied this recently in our laboratory, and table 1 is a summary of some of his experiments.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "From the Common Cold Unit, Medical Research"}, {"text": "Dr. Votava took nasal secretions from volunteers which contained either influenza B virus, or I may now make a brief aside, and ask, \"How on earth did these cultures do it?\" This is a problem that Dr. Dourmashkin and I have been interested in because, as those of you interested in the respiratory tract must realize, the respiratory epithelium is superbly equipped for removing particulate matter such as dust, bacteria, and viruses from its surface. It is continuously covered with mucus, which is moved along rapidly by the ciliary activity, and when we find that a culture like this is apparently much more effective at picking up viral particles than a monkey kidney culture, which doesn't move the virus particles along, we wonder how it is done. We considered this in a rather fanciful way and argued that the virus might exploit this very cleansing motion. Perhaps every time a viral particle comes near a cilium it is drawn to it as by a magnet; in this case the ciliary activity would, in fact, comb out viral particles from the medium and thus add to its efficiency.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "From the Common Cold Unit, Medical Research"}, {"text": "Was there any evidence that this actually happened? Figure 8 is a transverse section of a piece of ciliated epithelium, cut parallel to the surface, and 2 main structures can be seen. One is the cilia cut in cross-section, the membrane surrounding each one and the internal fibers, which probably produce the ciliary movement. There are also microvilli, protrusions from the surface of the cytoplasm, which are nonmotile and equivalent in some ways to the brush-border of other cells. Figure 9 shows a section in another place, this time normal to the surface of the cell. Microvilli can be seen, although the cilia are not cut or stained quite so well. But the point about this picture lies in the position of the vaccinia virus particles. It looks to us that just what one might expect is happening, i.e., viral particles, trapped perhaps in a bit of mucus, are being carried along over the surface of the epithelium by ciliary activity. Figure 10 shows similar epithelium exposed to influenza virus particles, and here the influenza virus particles are right down among the cilia, and many of them are sticking firmly, apparently, to the ciliary membrane. It does look, therefore, as though the influenza virus particles at least-we can't say about others-stick to the cilia. How they get into the cells after that and establish infection is not known.

We had at Salisbury among our volunteers' nasal washings some that would not yield viruses in tissue culture but that would cause colds in volunteers. One of these had some rather interesting properties. If we took the washings and filtered them through a gradocol membrane and inoculated them into volunteers, they produced colds. We thought that they might have been rhinoviruses, but when treated with ether overnight, they lost all their infectivity for volunteers and produced no colds. We thought that this might indicate that they were mycoplasmas, so we treated a group of volunteers with full doses of demcthylchlortetracycline. They got colds-typical upper respiratory disease. We thought, therefore, that we might be dealing with a lipid-containing virus, a myxovirus, a parainfluenza virus perhaps, which we could not cultivate very readily. Therefore the serum from volunteers who did get colds was titrated for all the then known myxoviruses-parainfluenza viruses, influenza A, B, and C, and also respiratory syncytial virus. No antibody rises were detected.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "From the Common Cold Unit, Medical Research"}, {"text": "We therefore made the suggestion, at a small meeting being held on myxoviruses by the CIBA Foundation, that perhaps there were some other sorts of myxoviruses around that could be cultivated, apart from the ones that we knew. Then a few more years went on and, as I have indicated, the organ culture technique became established. We wondered, therefore, whether this strange agent might be propagated in organ culture. We inoculated washings into organ cultures of human respiratory epithelium, and on successive days we collected the fluids and inoculated them into volunteers. Fluids on days 3 and 4 were pooled, and 4 out of 5 volunteers got colds. Even with fluids from days 8 and 9, 4 out of 7 volunteers got colds. By way of control, we inoculated these same washings into dishes that contained no tissue, and we got no colds. Similarly, if we used ferret rather than human tissue, we got no colds. This virus, apparently, like other viruses we had studied, could be propagated serially in human tissue; this was shown by passage in 4 serial transfers in such cultures [3] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1075, "end": 1078, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "From the Common Cold Unit, Medical Research"}, {"text": "We thought, therefore, that we had a virus growing, whatever it was, and that it would grow serially in these cultures. But we were only able to detect it by inoculation of volunteers. This is a pretty terrible technique for further study, so we looked at various possible alternative ways of detecting the presence of virus. Unfortunately this strain did not stop the cilia beating, so we could not use the method we had used with the HS virus. B814 virus could be detected by interference, the technique we had used originally with rhino viruses; cultures were given a dose of one of several viruses-enteroviruses or myxoviruses-and did not produce so much of this second virus as uninoculated control cultures. However, this was a difficult and cumbersome method to use, when each test required a set of organ cultures of human respiratory epithelium. Mrs. J. Almeida, then of S1. Thomas's Hospital, suggested to us that we should do direct electron microscopy of these cultures. I doubted that the procedure was practicable and set her a series of tests in which we sent her influenza-virus-infected, adenovirus-infected, and other organ cultures, under code. Every time she detected viral particles of the right shape in the right cultures, and so we then gave her additional organ cultures infected with B814 viruses, and in these she saw virus particles such as she had never seen from human material before (figure 11) . They had a pleomorphic appearance, and most of them were covered with a fringe of club-shaped projections, resembling in some ways the spikes of typical myxoviruses, but clearly not the same.

Table 1 is rather complex, but the general message of it is quite simple. If one uses neutralization, complement fixation tests, immunodiffusion with human sera or with animal sera, one can show serological relationships between the viruses of Dr. Hamre, some of the viruses that we obtained, the viruses obtained at NIH, and the MHV. But there is no known antigenic relationship at the moment between the human strains and the AlB viruses. Nevertheless, when it comes to cultivating the viruses, it is still generally true that the bird viruses grow only in bird cells, the mouse viruses grow in mouse cells, and the human viruses, with a few exceptions, grow only in human cells [7] . Now what are the effects of these viruses on the human population? We are still finding out. A serological survey against the 229E virus, done by Mr. Bradburne, shows that antibodies are pretty common in Britain in people of various ages. Last winter the frequency of antibodies increased, suggesting that during that period one of 569 these viruses related to the 229E was relatively prevalent in Britain. On the other hand, this also explains why MHV antibody is relatively common in human sera as well, because there are cross-reactions. In the case of the AlB virus, antibodies are found in human sera, but only in people who have close association with poultry-workers in packing plants and so on. . I am not going to say how many serotypes of virus there are for man, but it does seem that all the isolates tested so far-we have tested both the American and the British strains in our volunteers -are capable of producing colds. Table 2 shows some features of the disease produced. The lefthand side shows results obtained with coronaviruses, both the 229E type of Dr. Hamre and our B814; for comparison, results with typical rhinoviruses are shown on the right. A relatively high proportion of volunteers given coronaviruses get colds. There is at the moment before the final tribunal of viral nomenclature a proposal that all these viruses that I have been talking about, which are so similar in many ways, should be described by the term \"coronaviruses,\" to indicate that on electron microscopy, they look a little bit like a crown or a solar corona. It is not legal to use the term without quotation marks at the moment, so I must apologize for this, but it does happen to be less of a mouthful than some of the other pos- sible ways of describing the virus, such as avianinfectious-bronchitis-like-viruses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 825, "end": 828, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 144, "end": 151, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1766, "end": 1773, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "From the Common Cold Unit, Medical Research"}, {"text": "There is not always a tidy relationship between the presence of circulating antibody and the emergence of infection.
