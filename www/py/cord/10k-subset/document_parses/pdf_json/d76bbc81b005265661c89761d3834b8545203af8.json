Inappropriate or uncontrolled activation of complement can cause local and/or systemic inflammation, tissue damage and disease. Complement provides numerous options for drug development as it is a proteolytic cascade that involves nine specific proteases, unique multimolecular activation and lytic complexes, an arsenal of natural inhibitors, and numerous receptors that bind to activation fragments. Drug design is facilitated by the increasingly detailed structural understanding of the molecules involved in the complement system.

Complement is a key part of innate immunity and a modulator of the adaptive immune response; inherited deficiencies in complement proteins predispose individuals to bacterial infection and/or immune complex disease. The powerful cell-targeting and cell-killing properties of complement can be turned against self, a scenario that is prevented by the abundant expression of regulator proteins. In health, these regulator proteins maintain a fragile truce in which complement is continuously activated in what is known as tickover. Bacteria or other foreign surfaces lacking regulator proteins provoke massive activation and amplification of complement, generating activation products that label the invader, attract and activate phagocytic cells and directly cause lytic pathogen killing. Complement comprises a cluster of activation pathways that are triggered in various ways and progress through several amplifying enzymes to converge on a final common cell-killing pathway 1,2 . Surface-bound antibodies trigger the classical pathway, bacterial sugars initiate the lectin pathway and amplification is provided by the alternative pathway, regardless of initiating route (FIG. 1) . Fluid-phase regulators prevent uncontrolled activation in plasma, whereas membranebound regulators restrict activation on cells. The protective (and pathological) effects of complement are mediated by its activation products -active fragments or complexes of complement proteins. C3, the most abundant complement protein, has numerous activities; some C3 fragments (for example, C3b, iC3b and C3dg) can covalently bind to targets and act as flags to instruct phagocytes to bind to and engulf the targets, or they can enhance humoral immunity by facilitating B cell activation. The small C3a fragment, among its many roles, can attract and activate phagocytes. Downstream of C3, the terminal pathway releases the proinflammatory fragment C5a and assembles a pore in target membranesthe membrane attack complex (MAC) -that effects the lysis of bacteria and other activating cells.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1379, "end": 1387, "text": "(FIG. 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": ""}, {"text": "The list of diseases in which complement has a role, either primary or secondary to other triggers, is long and growing (TABLE 1) . Genetic deficiencies in complement components are relatively rare and associated with infections and immune complex diseases (BOX 1) ; however, excessive or dysregulated complement activation contributes to many inflammatory, autoimmune and degenerative diseases, and is a much larger problem 3, 4 . In a minority of these diseases, genetic changes, mutations or polymorphisms in complement proteins, regulators or receptors are the direct cause of dysregulation and disease; in most of these diseases, complement is not the primary cause but is recruited in response to tissue damage and serves to amplify and exacerbate inflammation and injury. Crucially, a small but growing group of conditions are now widely recognized as diseases caused by complement dysregulation, presenting obvious targets for complement-inhibiting drugs 5, 6 . Lessons from Figure 1 | Targets for inhibition in the complement pathway. The figure shows a highly simplified view of the complement system and highlights the targets for pathway inhibition. Activation is triggered through classical (antibody) or lectin (sugar) pathways that rapidly converge to form a complement C3-cleaving enzyme (C3 convertase), C4b2a. The alternative pathway can be independently activated to generate its own C3 convertase (C3bBb) but, more importantly, amplifies activation regardless of trigger. C3 fragments, both soluble and surface-attached, engage specific receptors on expressing cells to mediate key activities. The C5 convertase, formed by the recruitment of an additional C3b into the C3 convertase, cleaves C5 to release a small fragment, C5a, which binds to receptors on expressing cells to mediate activation events. Formation of C5b initiates the membrane attack pathway; sequential recruitment of components C6, C7, C8 and C9 creates a pore in the target membrane -the membrane attack complex (MAC) -that can activate or kill the targeted cell. The complement system presents many targets for inhibition with drugs. In the activation pathways these include the initiating complexes and enzymes, the initiators of the alternative pathway loop and the C3 convertases. In the C3-C5 axis, potential targets include the individual components (for example, C3 and C5), the activation fragments (for example, C3a and C5a) and the C5 convertases. In the terminal pathway, agents might target individual components (such as C5, C6 or C7) or intermediates (such as C5b6 and C5b67), block the functional MAC pore or inhibit the downstream signalling events that mediate cell activation or destruction.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 257, "end": 264, "text": "(BOX 1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 425, "end": 427, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 428, "end": 429, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 963, "end": 965, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 966, "end": 967, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 120, "end": 129, "text": "(TABLE 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 983, "end": 991, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Proteins and protein fragments that coat pathogens and dead or dying host cells to label them for recognition and elimination by phagocytes.

Experience gained from the first few drugs entering the clinic has added knowledge and identified issues that are specific to complement-targeted therapies. One major issue is dosing; most complement proteins are abundant in plasma and turn over rapidly, so adequate dosing of an inhibitor can be challenging. For example, C3 is present in plasma at ~1 g per l, and ~10-20% of total plasma C3 (~300-1000 mg) is consumed and replaced daily simply through the normal tickover process 23 . It is therefore obvious that large doses of complement-targeting drugs and frequent administration will be needed to block complement at the level of C3.

These huge and frequent doses contrast starkly with agents targeting cytokines, which are released de novo in disease and at much lower levels; for example, the tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-specific mAb adalimumab (Humira; AbbVie) is effective in rheumatoid arthritis at a dose of 40 mg every 2 weeks 26 . The plasma C5 concentration is ~80 mg per l and the turnover rate is ~60 hours 27 ; as a consequence, even with such high doses, breakthrough activity can occur in some patients treated with eculizumab and monitoring of complement activation in plasma is required 28 . Alexion have recently launched two new agents that are in Phase I trials (ALXN1210 and ALXN5500; 'next-generation' eculizumab molecules) that were probably developed to overcome some of the issues with eculizumab. C5 is not limiting in the complement cascade; therefore, inhibition at the C5 stage requires near-complete blockade or depletion of C5; these threshold kinetics necessitate large doses to achieve an effect. Approaches to circumvent the problem of high levels of protein turnover have been described, using drugs that only bind to activated forms of complement proteins, which are present at much lower concentrations in plasma 29, 30 ; these approaches show potential but have not been tested in humans.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 536, "end": 538, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1756, "end": 1759, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1760, "end": 1762, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2168, "end": 2170, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2252, "end": 2254, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2437, "end": 2439, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 3083, "end": 3086, "text": "29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 3087, "end": 3089, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Avoiding toxicity"}, {"text": "Apart from the problems arising from the sheer abundance of complement proteins, dosing is complicated because plasma complement levels vary widely in the population and because many are acute phase reactants, with synthesis increasing markedly in inflammation, which sometimes causes plasma levels to rise even in the face of increased consumption 31 .

We have reviewed this complotype concept previously 129 , and here we focus on its relevance to complementmediated diseases and therapy. Put crudely, individuals who have inherited a more active complotype are better able to resist infection but are at greater risk of complement-driven inflammation. Some variant proteins directly affect the activity of the amplification loop (for example, complement C3 R102G (C3-R102G) and Factor B R32Q (FB-R32Q)) 130 , and this is the primary reason for disease association, whereas others influence control local to the disease site, and risk is thus disease-or tissue-specific. This concept is well-illustrated by considering age-related macular degeneration (AMD): the most important genetic risk factor in AMD is a common polymorphism in the alternative pathway regulator FH that changes a single amino acid in the middle of the molecule (Y402H). The risk of developing AMD is at least threefold greater in His-variant homozygotes than in Tyr homozygotes 131, 132 . The Y402H variant influences the localization of FH to retinal ligands, whereas other complement polymorphisms (including those in FB and C3) influence AMD risk by increasing complement alternative pathway activity [133] [134] [135] ; common variants in just these three proteins together alter AMD risk up to 10-fold.

Onset of aHUS typically occurs in childhood or young adulthood and the frequency and severity of episodes is highly variable, with some patients having an indolent course requiring no therapy and others rapidly progressing to end-stage renal failure.

Many pharmaceutical companies are now focused on the development and manufacture of biologics because of their historical success, good economic return and low rate of attrition. As a consequence, most anti-complement agents developed to date are biologics -either antibodies or recombinant proteins -that deliver inhibitory activity. Essential to all drugs is their ability to get to the sites of disease; some complement-mediated diseases manifest in the vasculature (for example, PNH and vasculitis), whereas in other diseases (such as AMD, neuromyelitis optica and arthritis) complement attacks tissues at sites remote from systemic circulation. The ability of systemically-administered drugs to diffuse to the site of tissue damage and inflammation will thus be essential for treatment success. The liver produces most of the complement components found in the circulation, and if diffusion of circulating components to disease sites drives inflammation and disease then systemic depletion or blocking of specific complement components may ameliorate the pathology. However, locally produced complement is known to have key roles in some indications. For example, in renal allograft rejection, locally produced and activated C3 drives the T cell response and immune rejection 38 ; in this case, systemic anti-C3 therapy will be ineffective unless the drug gets into the tissues. Similar challenges exist in organs protected by tight barriers, such as the nervous system and the eye. In some diseases these barriers become damaged and leaky with disease progression, but it is likely that complement activation contributes to the early, pre-inflammatory stages of eye and brain diseases, so to be of value complement --inhibiting drugs are required in the relevant organ early in the disease when the barriers are still intact. Assuming that they have good bioavailability, small-molecule drugs may have advantages over biologics in these contexts because of their higher tissue penetrance; however, of the numerous small-molecule anti-complement agents that have been developed and tested in humans, none has yet progressed to the market [39] [40] [41] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1313, "end": 1315, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2175, "end": 2179, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 2180, "end": 2184, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 2185, "end": 2189, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Avoiding toxicity"}, {"text": "Getting in the way.

BB5.1 provided a powerful proof of principle for inhibition of the membrane attack complex (MAC) that was effective in numerous mouse models 140 ; BB5.1 also provided a rationale for the development of blocking mAbs specific to human C5. One such mAb, 5G1.1, was selected by Alexion, humanized and further manipulated to generate Fab (antigen-binding) and scFv (single-chain variable) fragments 141, 142 . By 2002, humanized 5G1.1, termed eculizumab, was in early clinical trials in a range of joint, kidney and skin conditions 143 ; however, its remarkable efficacy in paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) focused efforts in that area 144 . PNH is a clonal haematological disorder that involves chronic intravascular haemolysis, with complement lysis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor-deficient erythrocytes as its principal feature. Patients with PNH are anaemic with resultant lethargy and at risk of thrombosis. Prior to the use of eculizumab, treatment involved frequent blood transfusions and symptomatic support. Eculizumab transformed the outlook for patients with PNH, preventing haemolysis, reversing anaemia and removing transfusion dependence in most patients, thereby improving quality of life 145 . Eculizumab therapy is effective over the long term (>5 years), and substantially reduces mortality 146 . The only other disease for which eculizumab is currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). As with PNH, there were no specific therapies for this potentially catastrophic disease and the evidence implicating complement was overwhelming. In patients with aHUS, eculizumab treatment increased platelet number and improved renal function over the course of 1 year and some patients were no longer dependent on dialysis 147 . Numerous other clinical trials in various conditions are in progress, and these are summarized in TABLE 2. A major concern of governing bodies in the United Kingdom and elsewhere is cost; at the time of writing, standard PNH maintenance therapy (900 mg eculizumab delivered intravenously every 2 weeks) costs approximately UK\u00a3340,000 per patient per year; therefore, even for a rare disease with only ~200 cases in the United Kingdom, the estimated cost to the National Health Service (NHS) is \u00a358 million per year. A concise and up-to-date summary of the clinical data can be found on the electronic Medicines Compendium website (see Further information).

In humans, CR1 and CR2 are encoded by separate genes and have different roles: CR2 binds to C3dg and enhances humoral immunity whereas CR1 acts as a cofactor for the FI-mediated cleavage of C3b and has a key role in transporting immune complexes 48 . In mice, CR1 and CR2 are generated from the splicing of one gene and have limited expression; the main cofactor for C3b cleavage and generation of C3dg in the mouse is CR1-related gene/ protein Y (CRRY), a broadly expressed protein absent in humans 49 . Therefore, mice and humans respond to C3 fragments through different receptors and with different outcomes that will probably alter the effects of C3-targeted drugs. Nevertheless, in many models, disease mechanism and response to complement inhibition translate well and proof-of-principle is readily obtained.

An agent might inhibit progression in the activation or terminal pathways, act as an antagonist of an activation product, or cause activation and consumption of complement. Another broad distinction can be drawn between those drugs that inhibit complement systemically and those that are directed to specific sites of pathology to localize their inhibitory activity. Anti-complement drugs can also be divided into categories based upon their molecular characteristics: purified or recombinant forms of naturally occurring human regulators; modified protein copies or mimics of natural regulators; copies of pathogen-derived regulators; mAbs or fragments of mAbs; naturally occurring or synthetic small-molecule inhibitors; or antisense or similar nucleic acid constructs.

Initiation of classical or lectin pathway activation involves the recognition of an activating surface; in the classical pathway this activation occurs through a surfacebound antibody that ligates C1q, whereas in the lectin pathway this occurs via specific sugars on the surface that bind to MBL or collectins (FIG. 1) . Agents that block these events would switch off the respective activation pathways at the very first step, an attractive prospect given the amplifying nature of the complement system 51 . A potential classical pathway inhibitor might block C1q-binding sites on the antibody or the antibody-binding sites on C1q. A lectin pathway inhibitor might mask surface MBL-binding sugars or the sugar-binding sites on MBL. In either case, the agent would need to bind the target with higher affinity than the physiological ligand to compete effectively. Alternatively, an agent could disrupt or prevent the assembly of the multi-molecular complex, which comprises the recognition unit (C1q and MBL in the classical and lectin pathways, respectively) and the associated enzymes (C1r and C1s in the classical pathway and MASP1 and MASP2 in the lectin pathway) that are essential for pathway activation 52 . Both complexes circulate preassembled in plasma, so any agent targeting the complex would need to dislodge the bound enzyme to be effective; surprisingly, the C1s-and MASP2-targeting mAbs from True North and Omeros, respectively (described below), both achieve this effect. Another approach to inhibiting activation of the complexes would be to develop a molecular lock that restricts the conformational changes in C1q or MBL that occur upon ligand binding and are essential for activation of the associated enzymes. Such approaches have been used successfully to develop small-molecule inhibitors of chemokine receptor activation 53,54 , but have not yet been reported for C1 or the MBL-MASP complex. Several C1q function-blocking mAbs have been reported and were recently shown to be effective in a murine model of the antibody-mediated demyelinating disease, neuromyelitis optica 55 . Numerous peptide blockers of antibody-C1q interactions have been described, derived from the sequences of C1q binding sites in the antibody, C1q receptors or C1q itself, or selected from libraries. One such peptide blocker, termed peptide 2J, is a powerful inhibitor of the classical activation pathway in multiple species 56 ; however, there have been no further reports of this agent. Other peptides have been described that interfere with the binding of C1r and C1s in the C1 complex, but none has progressed beyond in vitro studies. The binding of MBL to specific sugar residues on surfaces presents a potential drug target, but no agents acting in this manner are reported.

The precise steps involved in activation of the MBL-MASP complex are less clear but probably involve a similar multi-step process 58 . The serine protease enzymes in these complexes are potential targets for pharmacological inhibition. Both the pharmaceutical industry and nature itself have invested heavily in the development of serine protease inhibitors (SPIs), and numerous SPI drugs have been made, of differing specificities and compositions, to target the myriad serine proteases essential for digestion, haemostasis, immunity, reproduction and many other physiological and pathological processes. The biggest problem in designing an SPI drug to inhibit a particular protease is specificity -almost all SPI drugs have some 'off-target' effects that can limit their use. Even nature struggles -the sole natural inhibitor of C1r and C1s is an SPI, C1 inhibitor (C1INH; also known as SERPING1), but C1INH also controls MASPs and proteases in the coagulation and kinin systems. Indeed, deficiency of C1INH leads to dysregulation in all these proteolytic cascades that, in aggregate, cause the disease HAE 59, 60 .

Remarkable successes in these early studies rapidly led to the adoption of plasma-derived C1INH as the standard of care for acute episodes in HAE. The obvious advantage of this approach is that a plasma-derived molecule should be low risk (once infectious agents are eliminated) and non-immunogenic. The widespread availability of industrial-scale protein-fractionation facilities -established for the production of immunoglobulins, albumin and other plasma products -made this a viable approach for purifying C1INH.

Deficiency of FH is rare and always associated with severe C3 dysregulation in plasma or on cell surfaces that leads to a range of renal diseases, including C3 glomerulopathy and aHUS; FH deficiency has been successfully treated with plasma exchange, strongly suggesting that FH would be an effective therapy in these diseases 75 . Indeed, in FH-deficient mice, therapy with human FH reversed renal injury 76 . AMD is strongly linked with the FH Y402H polymorphism, and this has provoked intense interest in giving at-risk individuals the protective Y402 form of FH to prevent or treat AMD. Several companies established programmes to produce plasmaderived or recombinant FH with this as the primary aim, but none of these programmes survive. Of note, some evidence from mouse models and human studies suggest that FH would need to be administered intra-ocularly in AMD to control complement dysregulation locally and alter the course of disease 77, 78 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1249, "end": 1251, "text": "75", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 1328, "end": 1330, "text": "76", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 1868, "end": 1871, "text": "77,", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 1872, "end": 1874, "text": "78", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Box 3 | Inhibiting protein-protein interactions"}, {"text": "In one study, instead of expressing full-length FH for use in therapy, this large molecule was stripped down to its key functional units and re-assembled to create a minimized FH, mini FH, which comprised four amino-terminal, complement-regulatory short consensus repeats and two carboxy-terminal, surface-binding short consensus repeats joined by a short linker.

The membrane regulators of the C3 convertases present a different challenge compared to the plasma regulators in that they cannot readily be purified for testing as potential drugs. The only way to test whether a membrane regulator might work as a therapeutic is to make a recombinant soluble form. The first of these, described in 1990, was a soluble recombinant form of CR1 (known as sCR1 or TP10) comprising the entire extracellular sequence of thirty short consensus repeats (>1,800 amino acids). The protein was a powerful inhibitor of both classical and alternative pathway convertases in vitro in human and rodent sera; pretreatment with sCR1 protected against reperfusion injury in a rat model of myocardial infarction 88 . Over the ensuing two decades, this agent provided an excellent proof-of-principle for complement inhibition in diverse models of human disease, effective in a wide range of disease models and in rodents, pigs and primates. After initial development work by SmithKline Beecham, Avant Immunotherapeutics took sCR1 into clinical trials in adult respiratory distress syndrome, acute lung injury and cardiopulmonary bypass; although some positive results were described 37 , there were also many failures, notably in large sepsis trials, and sCR1 has not progressed for these indications. More recently, guided by success in animal models, sCR1 entered The amplification (C3b feedback) loop is a positive-feedback cycle that consumes complement C3 to generate more enzyme and activation products; if unregulated, it cycles until all available C3 is consumed. Tight regulation is provided in the plasma by enzymes and cofactors that remove the C3 fragment C3b from the feedback cycle for breakdown into smaller fragments. As a consequence, the C3b feedback cycle normally operates at a very low rate (tickover). The balance between activation and regulation is disturbed in disease; a healthy balance can be restored by providing extra control (for example, increasing regulation, such as that provided by the complement regulatory protein Factor H (FH), thereby increasing 'feed out' from the amplification loop) or by preventing the formation of C3b in the feedback cycle (for example, by blocking convertase enzyme, thereby decreasing 'feed in' to the amplification loop).

This activity of cobra venom was recognized over a century ago, and purified CVF was first used as a tool to render the complement system of rodents deficient almost 50 years ago, making it the first anti-complement 'therapeutic' (REFS 100, 101) . Although the empiric use of cobra venom in therapy has a long history in everything from cancer to cosmetics, CVF as a drug has severe limitations: first because it is immunogenic, which renders repeat injections ineffective, and second because rapid and complete activation of complement by CVF generates high concentrations of C5a, causing circulating neutrophils to activate and aggregate in the lungs and other organs 102 . It is also unclear whether CVF can deplete complement locally in tissues. Attempts to address immunogenicity through humanization of CVF have created a hybrid that is 94% identical to human C3; small stretches of CVF-derived sequences in the C3 \u03b1-chain are sufficient to retain CVF-like complement consumption 103 . Although immunogenicity may be low, concerns over the toxic effects of continuous consumption of complement by CVF ensure that use will be restricted to acute conditions. Supplementation of the plasma convertase regulators offers therapeutic possibilities above and beyond the restoration of plasma levels in rare cases of deficiency. Systemic modulation of the cascade using endogenous soluble regulators (or soluble versions of membraneassociated control proteins) is likely to cause downmodulation rather than complete blockade and effect therapy in a manner that is more measured. Efforts to modulate complement by administering extra FH or FI are described above. However, the amounts of protein needed to raise plasma levels sufficiently to affect convertase activity may be prohibitive; the feasibility of this approach will require careful dose prediction, and dosing will probably be disease-specific and perhaps individualspecific.

The polypeptides C3a and C5a, released owing to the action of the C3 and C5 convertase enzymes, are biologically active, and they bind specific receptors on phagocytes and many other cell types to exert effects. The range of cell targets and activities is large and reviewed well elsewhere 106 , but their pro-inflammatory activities are particularly relevant to disease. C5a is a powerful inflammatory trigger implicated in many diseases, whereas C3a exhibits a complex mix of pro-and anti-inflammatory activities 107 . Both C3a and C5a (and their metabolites) bind to seven-transmembrane-domain G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are members of the large cytokine and chemokine receptor family. Similar to other GPCRs, those that bind C5a and C3a are attractive drug targets; many specific small-molecule blockers have been developed for cytokine receptors, although few have been developed for chemokine receptors, which more closely resemble the C3a anaphylatoxin chemotactic receptor (C3aR) and C5aR1 (REF. 108 ). Domp\u00e9 Pharmaceutical have described small-molecule C5aR1 blockers and claim potential for therapy of a wide panel of diseases; however, no trials are yet reported. Perhaps the most studied C5aR1 blocker is the cyclic hexapeptide PMX53, invented by Taylor and Woodruff and developed first by Peptech and then Arana Therapeutics 109 . This agent, modelled on the C terminus of C5a, showed high specificity and nanomolar affinity for C5aR1 and worked across many species; this latter property enabled the testing of PMX53 in a broad sweep of rodent models of inflammatory disease, and in many of these models this peptide had good efficacy. A number of Phase I and IIa clinical trials with PMX53 were initiated in rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, psoriasis and AMD; the molecule proved safe, but all trials were terminated because of poor efficacy. One possible reason for these failures was the poor oral bioavailability and tissue penetrance of PMX53 (REF. 110) . A modified version of PMX53, PMX205, shows improvements in these parameters and may re-surface in future trials, perhaps in combination with other agents. An orally active small molecule that blocks C5aR1 has also been developed by ChemoCentryx; this agent, CCX-168, has completed Phase II studies in anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) vasculitis, in which it was successful in enabling the reduction and elimination of high-dose corticosteroids and demonstrated improvement in renal health parameters. In 2014, CCX-168 was granted Orphan Drug status in both ANCA-associated vasculitides and aHUS.

Noxxon described a series of L-RNA aptamers (Spiegelmer; NOX-D19 to NOX-D21) that block C5a; these agents were effective in models of sepsis and transplant rejection 112, 113 , but have not yet progressed to humans. All of the above suggests that pharmacological blockade of C3a and/or C5a activities might be relatively straightforward; however, such an approach will only work in those situations in which these molecules are the major drivers of pathology, such as in neutrophilmediated disorders including ANCA-vasculitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lupus. Targeting C5. As described above, C5 is activated to create two moieties with distinct activities. The small fragment, C5a, is a powerful chemoattractant, and therapeutic blockade of its activities is described above. The larger fragment, C5b, forms the foundation of the MAC. Assembly of the MAC involves the nonenzymatic aggregation of the five terminal pathway components (C5b and C6-C9) into a pore that inserts into and through the cell membrane. C5b, while still attached to the convertase, binds sequentially to C6 and C7; the C5b67 complex is released from the convertase and binds to the membrane via a labile hydrophobic site. C8 and multiple copies of C9 are recruited in turn to build the pore. MAC activity is naturally regulated by inefficiencies built into the assembly system and by regulators policing the membrane to block complexes that reach the surface. The hydrophobic binding site in C5b67 is intrinsically unstable, decaying by interaction with water in a fraction of a second. Additionally, there are several proteins in the plasma that bind to the MAC to further restrict its capacity to bind to the membrane: clusterin and vitronectin (also known as S protein) are multifunctional proteins that, among their many roles, inhibit MAC assembly in this way, and C8 is an efficient inhibitor if it binds to C5b67 in the fluid phase. Once bound to the membrane, C5b67 is protected from these plasma inhibitors and recruits C8 and C9 to form the MAC. The last line of defence is the membrane regulator CD59, a small glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)anchored protein that binds to the forming complex and prevents the completion of the MAC pore.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 570, "end": 574, "text": "112,", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 575, "end": 578, "text": "113", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Targeting individual convertase components or regulators."}, {"text": "Opportunities for therapeutic inhibition are legion. The first obvious target is the first MAC component, C5b. Cutting off the supply of C5b by targeting the C3 and C5 convertases will inhibit MAC production; alternatively, C5 itself can be targeted to render it resistant to cleavage, which is the mode of action of the C5 monoclonal eculizumab, the most successful complement-specific drug to date. The success of eculizumab (BOX 2) has triggered interest in other ways of preventing C5 cleavage. Novartis have taken a C5-specific mAb, LFG316, into Phase II trials of intraocular therapy in advanced AMD (completed but unpublished) and, more recently, in choroiditis and panuveitis 114 . In August 2015, Novartis announced Phase I trials to assess the safety and efficacy of LFG316 in patients with PNH (NCT02534909). A recombinant human C5-specific mAb fragment, Mubodina (Adienne Pharma & Biotech), that prevents cleavage of C5 has undergone early-stage trials in aHUS and other renal diseases, although no development has been reported recently. Ornithodoros moubata complement inhibitor (OmCI), a small (16 kDa) lipocalin present in the saliva of soft ticks, is a potent C5 inhibitor that probably protects the tick from complement in its blood meal 115 . Recombinant OmCI (Coversin; Volution Immuno Pharmaceuticals) blocked C5 in numerous species and inhibited disease in rodent models 116, 117 . The drug bound C5 at a site remote from the convertase cleavage site, suggesting that it functioned by either blocking the interaction of C5 with the convertase or preventing conformational change essential for cleavage. Coversin completed Phase I trials in 2014 and is in development for PNH and other MAC-driven diseases. SOBI002 is a C5-blocker that is based on Affibody technology and developed by Swedish Orphan Biovitrum. Inclusion of an albumin-binding motif extends the plasma halflife of SOBI002. This small (~12 kDa) protein, derived using phage display, avidly binds to C5 and prevents cleavage; the simple structure of SOBI002 makes synthesis easy and inexpensive. SOBI002 is currently in a Phase I trial, which was recently listed as terminated (NCT02083666). Various non-biologic approaches have also been developed and are either soon to be tested or already in clinical trials. Ophthotech have developed a C5-specific aptamer (ARC1905, also known as Zimura) that, when given intraocularly in a Phase IIa study in combination with an antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), improved outcomes in patients with wet AMD. The RNAi approach taken by Alnylam is described above; at the 2014 American Society of Haematology (ASH) meeting, Alnylam reported effective knockdown in non-human primates using ALN-CC5 (see Further information), and Phase I trials are now underway with PNH as the primary indication. Interim Phase I data demonstrate substantial knock-down of C5 in singleascending-dose studies in humans (as announced in a recent Alnylam press release). RaPharma have developed a cyclic peptide that binds to C5 and prevents cleavage and activation; promising preclinical data were reported at ASH 2014 (see Further information), and Phase I studies are proposed for the near future. As with many of the C5-targeting agents reported here, the primary indication is likely to be PNH.

It is a rapidly moving field and, inevitably, some compounds will progress, others will fail and new drugs will emerge to take their positions in the landscape in the coming months and years. One certainty is that this already crowded field will become much more so in the near future. MAC formation, could be targeted. Regenesance BV has targeted C6 with both blocking C6-specific mAb and antisense approaches, and the latter was effective in animal models 105 . Regenesance also described a smallmolecule inhibitor of C6 in development for Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, but further development was not reported. A recent publication describes a small molecule (aurin tricarboxylic acid) that inhibits MAC assembly by blocking C9 binding; the agent prevented the lysis of PNH erythrocytes by serum ex vivo 121 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 800, "end": 803, "text": "118", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 1082, "end": 1086, "text": "119,", "ref_id": "BIBREF125"}, {"start": 1087, "end": 1090, "text": "120", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}, {"start": 1898, "end": 1901, "text": "105", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 2242, "end": 2245, "text": "121", "ref_id": "BIBREF127"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1183, "end": 1191, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Targeting individual convertase components or regulators."}, {"text": "Localizing therapeutics to sites of pathology Inhibition of systemic complement activity is a major concern with most anti-complement drugs as it renders the recipient susceptible to infection.

At its simplest, local delivery could mean direct administration to the site of disease -into the inflamed joint, eye or brain, for example. More interesting are the many modifications that have been made to ensure the homing of an agent where needed. Modification of sCR1 to favour its accumulation on inflamed endothelia (TP20) increased efficacy in models 89 , and addition of a membrane-binding tag to a truncated form of sCR1 (Mirococept) converted an inactive fragment into a viable therapeutic 90, 91 .

It is important that the drug that is delivered to the site is able to 'recycle' and release its target once inactivated, otherwise the target surface will rapidly become saturated with useless agent. More than 20 years ago, we described a prodrug approach whereby recombinant forms of natural regulators were generated as Fc fusion proteins in which regulatory activity was absent because of steric hindrance.

The same group also described a CR2-FH hybrid protein that was effective in several murine models 125 ; this provided the impetus to create a human CR2-FH hybrid, TT30, which is currently under development by Alexion for therapy of PNH (ALXN1102 and ALXN1103) 22, 126 . Potential advantages of this agent over eculizumab include a reduced risk of infection, a lower dose requirement and protection of PNH erythrocytes from C3 deposition and the resultant extravascular haemolysis.

However, the future looks much brighter; new therapeutics are entering the clinic, targeting different parts of the complement system, with different half-lives, different routes of administration and each with its own range of activities and side effects (FIG. 3) . Importantly, although the emphasis on orphan applications was pivotal in getting the first agents to the market, many of the new agents target common acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, for example AMD, arthritis and cardiovascular disease.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 705, "end": 713, "text": "(FIG. 3)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Targeting individual convertase components or regulators."}, {"text": "Hurdles to the commercialization of complement therapeutics still exist, including cost, routes of administration and infection risk. Short-duration complement inhibition, particularly in a controlled clinical environment, carries the least risk, and anti-complement drugs will probably first become mainstream for acute indications, such as reperfusion injuries. For chronic conditions, cost, ease of administration and safety may be substantial issues. Cost will become less of an issue as increased competition (the emergence of small-molecule inhibitors) and increased use should, theoretically, bring prices down rapidly. The experience of chronic therapy with agents that block complement is still relatively short-term, and it is possible that the elimination of molecules, such as C5a, may affect other activities of this multi-functional molecule, such as modulation of adaptive immunity, in the long term 106 . However, eculizumab was approved for use in PNH in 2007 and for aHUS in 2011 and, although the long-term consequences of C5 blockade remain uncertain, it is encouraging that after almost a decade of use no substantial adverse effects have been noted in carefully monitored and compliant recipients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 915, "end": 918, "text": "106", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Targeting individual convertase components or regulators."}, {"text": "Frequent intravenous administration is not clinically acceptable for chronic use, and so agents will need either very long half-lives or to be delivered by routes not requiring medical intervention (for example, subcutaneous or oral).

Inevitably, different diseases will require different approaches to complement inhibition -some may be entirely MAC-driven, others C5a-dependent, and most involve a complicated interplay between the various complement products and other inflammatory mediators. Selecting the right agent or agents will be crucial to success in trials, and here a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms by which complement drives pathology in the target disease is a sine qua non. Biomarkers that reflect complement activation in fluids and tissues can inform the selection of the right drug for the right patient, demonstrating engagement of the target and efficacy of the drug, and monitoring response to therapy. A lack of good biomarkers often handicaps early stage trials and simple readouts of effectiveness are crucial. In some cases this is obvious; for example, blockade of MAC formation can be demonstrated in serum through simple haemolytic assays. When activation fragments such as C3a, C5a, C4d, Bb and terminal complement complex (TCC) are present in the disease their levels can be monitored to demonstrate response to therapy and confirm target engagement. In some diseases, such as PNH, there is an obvious clinical readout of target engagement -eculizumab treatment prevents intravascular haemolysis in PNH. However, for diseases restricted to specific sites, for example, the retina, central nervous system or kidney glomerulus, plasma complement biomarkers may not reflect the response to therapy and are poor tools for assessing target engagement. There is thus a need for effective, non-invasive methods to detect complement activation and deposition within affected tissues without resorting to biopsy. Methods for imaging complement activation in vivo may fill this need; agents comprising the C3-binding domain of CR2 have been used to detect C3 fragments deposited in the kidney by magnetic resonance imaging in mouse models 127 . Antibodies against C3dg have also been developed as imaging agents and shown to identify retinal lesions in a mouse model of AMD 128 .
