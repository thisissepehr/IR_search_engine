However, this may be falsely reassuring. Most indications suggest that it is just a matter of time until the next influenza pandemic occurs (Osterholm 2005) . In the words of the UK Chief Medical Officer: \"most experts believe that it is not a question of whether there will be another severe influenza pandemic but when\" (Department of Health 2005) . Although experts are agreed that a future influenza pandemic is almost inevitable, its timing is unpredictable and it is uncertain whether the virus responsible will be H5N1 or another, novel, influenza strain (Osterholm 2005) . A recent editorial described avian influenza as a \"predicament of extraordinary proportions\" (Anonymous 2006) .

In the following two pandemics -in 1957 (H2N2; \"Asian influenza\") and 1968 (H3N2; \"Hong Kong influenza\") -the mortality was strikingly lower, with each pandemic killing approximately one million people (Hien et al. 2004 ). This highlights the association between the virulence of virus subtype and mortality. Death rates are also determined by various other factors including clinical attack rates, R 0 (basic reproduction number), vulnerability of affected populations and the effectiveness of preventive measures. It is therefore impossible to predict with accuracy the impact of the next pandemic. Best-case scenarios, modelled on the mild pandemic of 1968, predict global deaths in the range of 2-7.4 million (World Health Organization 2005a) . Should a virulent H5N1 become the next pandemic strain, evidence suggests that this strain would mimic the 1918 pandemic with estimates up to 360 million deaths globally (Osterholm 2005) .

In the absence of amantadine, the proton channel mediates an influx of H + ions into the infecting virion early in the viral replication cycle, which facilitates the dissociation of the ribonucleoproteins from the virion interior and allows them to be released into the cytoplasm and transported into the cell nucleus. In highly pathogenic avian viruses (H5 and H7), the M2-proton channel protects the hemagglutinin from acid-induced inactivation in the trans-Gol gi network during transport to the cell surface. In the presence of amantadine, the channel is blocked and replication is inhibited. The serine at position 31 lies partially in the protein-protein interface and partially in the channel (see inset). Replacement of serine by a larger asparagine leads to the loss of amantadine binding and the restoration of channel function. Depending on the particular amino acid, other mutations at position 26, 27, 30, or 34 may inhibit amantadine binding or allow binding without the loss of ion-channel function.
