The versatile functionality of Nef is partially attributed to different conformational states and posttranslational modifications, such as myristoylation. Up to now, many interaction partners of Nef have been identified using classical yeast two-hybrid screens. Such screens rely on transcriptional activation of reporter genes in the nucleus to detect interactions. Thus, the identification of Nef interaction partners that are integral membrane proteins, membrane-associated proteins or other proteins that do not translocate into the nucleus is hampered. In the present study, a split-ubiquitin based yeast twohybrid screen was used to identify novel membrane-localized interaction partners of Nef. More than 80% of the hereby identified interaction partners of Nef are transmembrane proteins. The identified hits are GPM6B, GPM6A, BAP31, TSPAN7, CYB5B, CD320/TCblR, VSIG4, PMEPA1, OCIAD1, ITGB1, CHN1, PH4, CLDN10, HSPA9, APR-3, PEBP1 and B3GNT, which are involved in diverse cellular processes like signaling, apoptosis, neurogenesis, cell adhesion and protein trafficking or quality control. For a subfraction of the hereby identified proteins we present data supporting their direct interaction with HIV-1 Nef.

Their plasma membrane was untypically frayed and structures that are reminiscent of neurite-like outgrowths or filopodia, which recently had been described for Cos-7 cells by others [16, 17] , could be observed. These structures showed high levels of GPM6B ( Figure 3A) . Interestingly, the presence of Nef affected the extent to which the membrane extensions occurred. In general, less and shorter outgrowths were observed when Nef was present in the cells in addition to GPM6B ( Figure 3B ). Cos-7 cells cotransfected with pGFP-GPM6B and the empty control vector (pDsRed) did not show significant changes in the length of the extensions compared to cells transfected only with pGFP-GPM6B.

This region is known to be necessary and sufficient for downregulation of CD4 by Nef (e.g. reviewed in [5, 6] ) and also its direct binding to Nef is well characterized ( [19] [20] [21] ). Thus, we investigated, whether any of the other proteins identified from the Y2H-screen show similarities to already known Nef interaction motifs. Comparison of residues 114 to 125 of the GPM6B cytoplasmic loop (Q13491-1) and 108-119 of GPM6A with the sequence of the Nef binding motif of CD4 (amino acids 408 to 419 of the mature protein chain; Figure 4A ) resulted in striking sequence similarities. In this region, GPM6B and CD4 sequences show a 50% identity and 25% similarity by only three out of controls, cells were alternatively transfected with a bait expression vector coding for the SV40 large T antigen (largeT) instead of Nef. The resulting immunoprecipitates were electrophoretically separated, blotted (WB) on a PVDF-membrane as indicated at the right and detected with anti-Myc or anti-HA antibodies. The approximate molecular weights of the proteins are shown. twelve residues that do not fit the alignment. The alignment of the respective regions of GPM6A and PLP1 with this CD4 region also showed striking similarities ( Figure 4B ). This suggests that the conserved cytoplasmic loop region of GPM6B and GPM6A might contain a Nef binding site similar to that of CD4. This region is notably also conserved in the myelin proteolipid protein (PLP1), which is the prototype protein of the PLP family. As shown in Figure 4D , fluorescence titrations using purified Nef protein and synthetic FITC-labeled peptides derived from the cytoplasmic parts of GPM6B or PLP1 respectively, verified a direct and rather robust interaction between the molecules with K D values ranging below 1 mM. Mutations in CD4, in which leucines 413 and 414 were replaced with alanines, renders CD4 refractory to Nefinduced downregulation [22] [23] [24] and at least in vitro drastically reduces the binding affinity of synthetic CD4 peptides to fulllength Nef protein [20, 21] . If this is the same binding determinant as the previously identified and well known Nef binding site of CD4, one may expect that the residues in GPM6B that correspond to the dileucine-motif also play an important role. Therefore, we also analyzed a peptide variant (GPM6B AA ) in which the dileucine-motif corresponding residues leucine 119 and histidine 120 of GPM6B were replaced by alanines. The relative fluorescence of FITC-labeled GPM6B AA was virtually independent of Nef concentration, suggesting that it did not bind to Nef ( Figure 4D , open circles). The mutation of leucine 119 and histidine 120 to alanines drastically reduced the affinity of the examined GPM6B peptide to Nef. This clearly shows that both residues contribute to Nef-GPM6B binding. It underlines the similarities between the Nef binding sites in CD4 and PLP-like proteins. Very interestingly, also in CD320/TCblR a region with high similarity to the Nef binding site of CD4 could be identified inside its short cytoplasmic portion ( Figure 4C ).

Such transient interactions are more easily detected by using a split-ubiquitin based Y2H screen, as was used in the present study. Here, Nef-prey complexes do not have to overcome lysis and purification steps, but only have to exist long enough to allow the ubiquitin hydrolase to separate the transactivating moiety from the Nef-prey complex, which subsequently switches on reporter gene transcription.

The indicated residue numbers show the beginning and the end of the amino-terminally fluoresceinylated GPM6B and PLP1 peptides used for the Nef binding studies shown in D. Numbering of GPM6B is based on UniProtKB entry Q13491-1 throughout this figure. C. Sequence of the cytoplasmatic portion of CD320/TCblR, homologies to CD4 indicated as described above. D. Fluorescence titration of 0.5 mM of fluoresceinyl-labeled peptides, GPM6B 112-127 , GPM6B AA , or PLP 193-108 with recombinant HIV-1SF2 Nef 2-210 protein (prepared as described in [68] ). The fluorescence signals are shown as a function of the Nef 2-210 protein concentration. Values result from the fluorescence of the peptides in the presence of the indicated concentration of Nef 2-210 in comparison with a buffer control titration. Assuming a simple bimolar interaction between the peptide and Nef 2-210 , the data were described by a model based solely on the law of mass action which accounts for ligand depletion [71] . Several recent genome-wide screening approaches for reduced viral replication upon RNAi knock down revealed more than 1000 annotated gene candidates for cellular proteins, also called ''HIV-1 dependency factors'' (HDF) that negatively influenced viral replication in cell culture [28] [29] [30] [31] . Although hits of such RNAi screens cannot be assigned to specific HIV-1 proteins, as for example Nef, and it is well known that Nef is dispensable for HIV replication in cell cultures [32] , which actually was the readout in the mentioned RNAi screens, we compared our hits with the lists of the published HDFs.
