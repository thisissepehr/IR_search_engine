Plasmodium merozoite surface protein 4 (MSP4) has been listed as a blood-stage subunit vaccine candidate for malaria. Infection with Plasmodium ovale species including P. ovale wallikeri and P. ovale curtisi, is also a source of malaria burden in tropical regions where it is sometimes mixed with other Plasmodium species. However, little is known about P. ovale MSP4.",

Recombinant proteins (rPoMSP4) were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, analysed, and immunized in BALB/c mice.

Further, truncated PoMSP4 segments were successfully expressed and purified as ~ 32 kDa proteins. Importantly, high antibody responses with end-point titres ranging from 1:10,000 to 1:2,560,000 in all immunized mouse groups were observed, with high IgG avidity to PocMSP4 (80.5%) and PowMSP4 (92.3%). Furthermore, rPoc-MSP4 and rPowMSP4 cross-reacted with anti-PowMSP4-specific or anti-PocMSP4-specific antibodies. Additionally, anti-PoMSP4 IgG antibodies showed broad immuno-specificity in reacting against rPoMSP1 and rPoAMA1. Lastly, PocMSP4-and PowMSP4-immunized mice induced cellular immune responses with PocMSP4 (36%) and PowMSP4 cells (15.8%) during splenocyte proliferation assays. Conclusion: Findings from this study suggest conservation in PoMSP4 protein sequences and high immunogenicity was observed in rPoMSP4. Furthermore, induction of immune responses in PocMSP4-and PowMSP4-immunized mice informed that both humoral and cellular immune responses play crucial roles for PoMSP4 in protection.",

            "text": "World Health Organization (WHO) estimated 219 million cases of malaria and 435,000 deaths, a figure that was assumed too high [2] . Effective vaccine development was emergently required to enhance existing malaria control measures because of the moderate spread of drug and insecticide resistance. Recently, some African countries applied one vaccine RTS, S/AS01; however, this vaccine only targets Plasmodium falciparum [3] [4] [5] and might probably be inadequate in areas where a remarkable proportion of patients suffers from Plasmodium vivax or mixed infections. Moreover, three other parasitic species, namely, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae, and Plasmodium knowlesi, can cause malaria infection. Plasmodium ovale can cause malaria infection in humans but has lower incidence compared with P. falciparum and P. vivax [6, 7] . Some cases of P. ovale infection can occur in endemic areas of malaria where other species co-exist [8, 9] ; therefore, such evidence should be considered in malaria control strategies. Plasmodium ovale has been separated into two distinct species (P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri) in 2010 [10] [11] [12] . Similar to other malaria parasites of primates, Anopheles species are able to transmit P. ovale; the parasites then invade reticulocytes and begin the erythrocytic cycle that might last approximately 49 h [7] .",

            "text": "Hosts respond to malaria parasites by generating antibodies against parasite-derived antigens, and naturally acquired immunity is developed after repeated exposure to infections [13] . Notably, antibodies against merozoite antigens play a significant role in conferring immunity against malaria [14, 15] . Asexual-stage antigens located on apical organelles or on the surfaces of merozoites offer considerable potential as components of vaccines against malaria. Immune responses induced by such vaccines can block the invasion of host erythrocytes through merozoites [16] . Thus, malaria antigens recognized as candidates for vaccine development are generally grouped as pre-erythrocytic, erythrocytic, and transmission-blocking antigens. Antigens in the asexual stages of malaria parasites represent potential targets for malaria vaccines. Blood-stage vaccines point to target the subsequent disease-causing stage of the Plasmodium life cycle and may provide protection against disease severity, reducing blood stage asexual parasitaemia and transmission [17] . Merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1) and apical membrane antigen (AMA1) are leading bloodstage malaria antigens and considered important vaccine candidates [15] , especially due to their association with protection in pre-clinical studies of mice and nonhuman primates [18] [19] [20] . Protection is associated with the induction of high-titre antibodies. Several studies have investigated immune cross-reactivity of antigens in erythrocytic asexual blood stages. For example, immune sera and monoclonal antibodies against AMA1 manifested only limited cross-reactivity between P. falciparum and P. vivax [21] . Similar studies using sera from people infected with P. falciparum and P. vivax showed crossreactivity of merozoite surface protein 5 (MSP5)-specific antibodies [22] . Evidence of immune response has been reported for the asexual erythrocytic stages of P. falciparum and P. vivax antigens, but there is limited information on antigens of P. ovale species.",

Murine models of malaria showed that this protein can induce protective immunity against lethal challenge and protect against heterologous challenge by a different species of murine malaria [27, 28] . Immunization with recombinant Plasmodium yoelii MSP4/5 in mice, a homolog of MSP4 and its related antigen MSP5, has induced protective immune responses against lethal parasite challenge with P. yoelii [27, 28] ; protection is enhanced when MSP4/5 is immunized in combination with P. yoelii MSP1 [29] . This finding suggested that MSP4 is a potential malaria vaccine candidate, especially in combination with other antigens. MSP4 immunogenicity has been associated with protection in natural infections with P. falciparum [30] [31] [32] . In addition, MSP4 shows a high degree of conservation among P. falciparum isolates [16, 33, 34] , supporting its potential consideration as a subunit component for malaria vaccine formulations.

Thus, humoral immune responses are important against malaria parasites because they play essential roles in protecting against blood-stage malaria [38, 39] . Antibody responses against blood-stage antigens are known for their importance in protecting against malaria [40] , and this study showed that recombinant PoMSP4 proteins were immunogenic in mice. IgG antibody titres elicited by PocMSP4 and PowMSP4 fragments were substantially higher than those found in the control group (PBS), and sera from immunized mice showed positive reactivity with rPocMSP4 and rPowMSP4 proteins. Cross-reaction between rPocMSP4 and rPowMSP4 was detected through ELISA and Western blot analyses. These results suggested that rPoMSP4 shared similar antigenic determinants that could enable the measurement of species-specific efficacy in vaccine trials. Such high cross-reaction between the two proteins addressed the possibility that both proteins may be used together for vaccine design. However, this result would need future functional studies to address the possibility of vaccine development. Antibody avidity seems to play an important role in protective immunity [41] . Results of this study indicated that rPocMSP4 and rPowMSP4 induced high-avidity antibodies (PocMSP4: 80.50% and PowMSP4: 92.32%). These findings suggested that MSP4 is a valid model for understanding the immune response in mice. MSP1 and AMA1 proteins are currently being developed as subunits for the development of malaria vaccines [19, 42, 43] . In the present study, cross-antisera reaction between PoMSP4 and PoAMA1 or PoMSP1 was observed, that is, anti-PoMSP4 antiserum cross-reacted with recombinant PoAMA1 and PoMSP1 in ELISA. This ability of PoMSP4 antigens to generate antibodies with broad immune responses against such important proteins make them attractive candidates to induce a polyclonal immune response.",

Lymphocyte proliferation assays are widely used to measure cell-mediated T-cell immunity and responses to specific antigens [44, 45] . Besides humoral responses, the cellular immune response is also an important indicator for evaluating the immunogenicity of a vaccine candidate. As demonstrated by the results, of this study PocMSP4 and PowMSP4 proteins could induce cellular immune responses in mice, suggesting that humoral and cellular immune responses play crucial roles for PoMSP4 in protection.",

PoMSP4 could induce cellular immune responses. Though future studies are needed to assess the mechanism by which PoMSP4 fragments play roles in immune protection, but the fragments of P. ovale that were used in this study may be more widely evaluated as potential vaccine candidates.",
