The paper then examines the results within the context of historic and international trends and theoretical models of food policy, community food security, and applied policy research. Public Health re-emerged as a driver of food security in BC-both as a key player and in positing the public's health as a driver in food security and food systems. While Public Health's lead role supported an increase in legitimacy for food security in BC, interviewees described a clash of cultures between Public Health and civil society. The clash of cultures occurred partly as a result of Public Health's limited food security mandate and top down approach. Consequently civil society voice at the provincial level was marginalized. A social policy movement toward a new political paradigm-regulatory pluralismcalls for greater engagement of civil society, and for all sectors to work together toward common goals.

However, in comparison to current global food security movements, it is important to note that this movement occurred at an international institutional, not at a civil society level. The ''world food movement'' built on the work of British physician and scholar, Boyd Orr, who first established food security as a determinant of health by linking nutrition and income (Cepede undated; Diouf undated; Orr 1936; Ostry 2006) . During the Great Depression, despite international agricultural surpluses-which were often dumped or destroyed (Boudreau 1947; United Nations, undated) -farmers and agriculture suffered as prices of food and other commodities fell to a point at which there was little profit in production (Akroyd in Passmore 1980) . Moreover, as some populations suffered from hunger or malnutrition, ''hunger in the midst of plenty'' became a contemporary phrase (Akroyd in Boudreau 1947; Passmore 1980; Turnell 2000) . Restriction of world food production was suggested as a solution, to which some were appalled (Cepede, undated; Passmore 1980) . Instead, a ''nutrition approach'' to world agriculture was proposed (Turnell 2000) . The ''nutrition approach'' brought forth the concept of a ''marriage of health and agriculture,'' linking nutrition and State Supply chain Civil society Fig. 1 Food policy triangle as contested space (Lang 2005a, b) 2 ''Community Food Security is defined as a situation in which all community residents obtain a safe, culturally acceptable, nutritionally adequate diet through a sustainable food system that maximizes community self-reliance and social justice'' (Hamm and Bellows 2003, p. 37 ). the public's health (consumption) to the food supply (production) (Passmore 1980) . The situation of ''hunger in the midst of plenty'' was a concern for the League on humanitarian grounds, but also because of the potential effect upon the social structure and internal peace of concerned countries (League of Nations 1937). The Second World War broke out soon after, bringing these efforts of the League of Nations to an end (Hambidge 1955; Orr 1943) . 3 Since then, two opposing international trends of decentralization and centralization in food security have been identified . First, a centralizing trend toward global consolidation in food and agricultural trade has occurred in international institutions, regulation of food supply, trade policy, and the food supply. Globalization is a centralizing feature at the international level. 4 In opposition, a decentralizing trend has occurred at the international level in the definition and address of food security as it has moved from a global, supply approach to the household, access level Maxwell 1996) . Decentralization is also demonstrated by NGO involvement, multiple definitions of food security, and the notions of food democracy and community food security. Tensions between ''centralization'' and ''decentralization'' are experienced at both the broader global context and at the local level (Allen 1999; Dahlberg 2001; Hassanein 2003; Lang 1999; Wekerle 2004) , the latter of which will be illustrated through this paper.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 97, "end": 112, "text": "(Boudreau 1947;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 113, "end": 127, "text": "Hambidge 1955)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 498, "end": 514, "text": "(Cepede undated;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 515, "end": 529, "text": "Diouf undated;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 530, "end": 539, "text": "Orr 1936;", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 540, "end": 551, "text": "Ostry 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 665, "end": 680, "text": "(Boudreau 1947;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 681, "end": 705, "text": "United Nations, undated)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 854, "end": 868, "text": "Passmore 1980)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1013, "end": 1027, "text": "Boudreau 1947;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1028, "end": 1042, "text": "Passmore 1980;", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1043, "end": 1056, "text": "Turnell 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1153, "end": 1170, "text": "(Cepede, undated;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1171, "end": 1185, "text": "Passmore 1980)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1256, "end": 1270, "text": "(Turnell 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1473, "end": 1488, "text": "(Lang 2005a, b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1736, "end": 1765, "text": "(Hamm and Bellows 2003, p. 37", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1835, "end": 1850, "text": "(Passmore 1980)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2194, "end": 2209, "text": "(Hambidge 1955;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2210, "end": 2219, "text": "Orr 1943)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2222, "end": 2223, "text": "3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2610, "end": 2611, "text": "4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2815, "end": 2828, "text": "Maxwell 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 3126, "end": 3138, "text": "(Allen 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 3139, "end": 3153, "text": "Dahlberg 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 3154, "end": 3169, "text": "Hassanein 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 3170, "end": 3180, "text": "Lang 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 3181, "end": 3194, "text": "Wekerle 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1426, "end": 1432, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Historic and international trends in food security"}, {"text": "While many centralizing factors can be viewed as negative with their association to a ''top down'' approach, resolving food insecurity is a clear example where solutions need to be sought at both centralized (anti-poverty/government/right to food) and decentralized (local/bottom up) levels.

Further, the Public Health Core Program in Food Security also framed food security comprehensively (Provincial Health Services Authority 2007a).

These two programs also spurred the hiring of food security coordinators in all of the Regional Health Authorities, and they obliged Health Authorities to comply with performance requirements associated with each. The fact that such a relatively high number of food security initiatives was introduced-by Public Health and through the cross-ministry ActNow BC initiative-supports the legitimization within the government. Interviewees also suggested that Public Health involvement and funding to local initiatives from the Community Food Action Initiative increased the legitimacy of food security at the community and municipal levels. Nonetheless, food security is still acknowledged as a low priority within the government. The dilution of food insecurity (hunger) within the agenda was another consequence. Food insecurity is included only weakly in the initiatives. For example, the provincial school meal program-a major food security programwas not included as part of the new funding thrust. Where food insecurity is addressed in BC reports, it is approached from a preventive, anti-poverty lens (Dietitians of Canada and Community Nutritionists Council of British Columbia 2006; Provincial Health Officer 2006; Provincial Health Services Authority 2007b). However, in programs the approach is primarily food-centered, and through alleviation. Interviewees see that a broader food security agenda has the potential to both pave the way for hunger to be incorporated and to deter from the broader issues. Conflict over if and how to address food insecurity existed among stakeholders, and numerous barriers to inclusion were identified.

On the other side, civil society food security networks were criticized for their adversarial approach and were seen as lacking formality in representation. As noted above, lack of representation was particularly frustrating for civil society food security networks that were foundational in bringing the food security agenda forward in BC. Interviewees warned that their exclusion restricted both the broad source of expertise that informed the integration and the political base for further integration. Consequently, while most stakeholders agreed that food security should be further integrated into government agenda, some had a ''qualified'' yes; they suggested that they would only support it if they saw increased civil society participation.

In parallel with the shift to Public Health, power also shifted from civil society food security networks and Community Nutritionists, toward Public Health Food Security Coordinators and Administrators and civil society health-oriented NGOs. To some degree, the institutionalization of food security was the objective of those who advocated for the integration.

Why has the need for a new, integrated paradigm arisen? The rise of decentralization, in the form of increased civil society NGO participation-both internationally and at the local level-is a key component driving the need for reconfiguration. Within the context of globalization, civil society has an increasing understanding and awareness of the impacts of broader, centralized decisions on their personal and community food security. Civil society has thus assumed a greater voice and is increasingly engaged in food security, in some cases demanding the right to control their food supply and food systems. Further, they recognize that they may have more success in shifting the status quo by working with government-a lesson observed recently in successful municipal food policy initiatives. The fact that civil society and government employees had a strong history of working together on food security in BC facilitated the integrated top down/bottom up approach seen in the initiatives under review. Finally, as explored below, shrinking governments under neoliberalism may increasingly recognize the need to utilize civil society capacity in offering programs to fulfill population needs.

A social policy movement toward a new political paradigm called ''regulatory pluralism'' can move food security beyond centralized/ decentralized approaches. It calls for greater engagement of civil society and for all sectors to work together toward common goals. Gunningham and Sinclair (2002, p. 193) suggest that ''regulatory pluralism'' occurs when the ''government harness(es) the capacities of markets, civil society, and other institutions to accomplish its policy goals more effectively, with greater social acceptance, and at less cost to the state.'' The integration in BC described here could be argued to exemplify an undertaking on the cutting edge in progress toward reconfiguration. Specifically, the ActNow BC declaration that all ministries and to some extent industry need to work toward a greater goal of the public's health in order to address upwardly spiraling health care costs is an example of a redesign of the role of government. However, this is only a beginning, as civil society food security networks in BC would argue that their goals-and meaningful participation-need to be integrated into government goals in reconfiguration. Their marginalization in a process that they were instrumental in initiating suggests a lag in a shift toward ''regulatory pluralism and cultural recognition. 9 Both food policy (Koc et al. 2008 ) and business (Porter and Kramer 2011) literature support the adoption of the concept of regulatory pluralism and creating shared values. Moving toward ''regulatory pluralism'' would require the government to commit to a greater engagement of civil society in BC. Possible approaches toward greater engagement outlined in this research include: supporting capacity building for civil society, finding ways to share power, articulation of agendas and limitations, and a more conciliatory approach from civil society. Correspondingly, MacRae outlines ways to engage a wider range of actors in food policy at federal, provincial, and municipal government levels. These include, but are not limited to: broadened participation in advisory councils, bringing civil society organizations into governance models, creating provincial networks of municipal food policy councils, and undertaking joint programming with civil society organizations (MacRae 2011). However, echoing BC's experience, he states ''although new forms of regulatory pluralism are emerging, it is not obvious that governments and food system actors are skilled at, or committed to, their implementation'' (MacRae 2011, p. 431) . Further, he suggests that while regulatory pluralism can ''offer short term opportunities to widen the set of actors who participate in policy development,'' it does not preclude or replace longer term significant structural change needed to enact comprehensive Canadian food policy (MacRae 2011, p. 453) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 301, "end": 339, "text": "Gunningham and Sinclair (2002, p. 193)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1374, "end": 1390, "text": "(Koc et al. 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1406, "end": 1430, "text": "(Porter and Kramer 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2561, "end": 2582, "text": "(MacRae 2011, p. 431)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2868, "end": 2889, "text": "(MacRae 2011, p. 453)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Moving toward a new policy map"}, {"text": "In translating the notions of reconfiguration and integrated top down/bottom up approaches into a practical model, Lang (2005a, b) food policy triangle was used as a beginning point.
