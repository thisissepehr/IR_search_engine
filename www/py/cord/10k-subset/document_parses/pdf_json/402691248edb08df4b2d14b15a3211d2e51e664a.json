AIVs of low virulence may cause severe disease in the presence of exacerbating conditions or infections with other organisms. Very little is known concerning the pathogenicity of AIV strains in ostriches compared to chickens and other avian species. AIV has been isolated from a substantial number of feral and domestic avian species. It is known that some species e.g. waterfowls are refractory to AIV infections with respect to development of disease (Alexander, 1995) . At present there are very few reports on isolation of AIV from ratites. Allwright et al.
