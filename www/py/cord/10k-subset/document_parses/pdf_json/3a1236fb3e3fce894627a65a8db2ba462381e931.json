Methods/design: A multicentre, mixed-methods, open label, randomised controlled trial of septoplasty versus medical management for adults with a deviated septum and a reduced nasal airway. Eligible patients will have septal deflection visible at nasendoscopy and a nasal symptom score \u2265 30 on the NOSE questionnaire. Surgical treatment comprises septoplasty with or without reduction of the inferior nasal turbinate on the anatomically wider side of the nose. Medical management comprises a nasal saline spray followed by a fluorinated steroid spray daily for six months. The recruitment target is 378 patients, recruited from up to 17 sites across Scotland, England and Wales. Randomisation will be on a 1:1 basis, stratified by gender and severity (NOSE score). Participants will be followed up for 12 months post randomisation. The primary outcome measure is the total SNOT-22 score at 6 months. Clinical and economic outcomes will be modelled against baseline severity (NOSE scale) to inform clinical decision-making. The study includes a recruitment enhancement process, and an economic evaluation.",

Keywords: Nasal septum, Nasal obstruction, Septoplasty, Turbinates, Mometasone furoate, Clinical trial, Cost-effectiveness, Process evaluation Background Septoplasty is surgery to straighten the nasal partition between the two nostrils (the septum). Septoplasty is a commonly conducted operation worldwide, with approximately 250,000 operations performed annually in the US and approximately 22,000 in the United Kingdom (UK) [1, 2] . Most of these are carried out for nasal blockage and associated symptoms such as a snoring and sleep disturbance.",

Septal deviation or lesions in the nasal passages, such as nasal polyps or enlarged adenoids or turbinates, may cause a 'fixed' sensation of blockage. 'Fluctuating' blockage symptoms may be caused by inflammatory conditions of the nasal epithelium such as infective or allergic rhinitis. In addition, the 'nasal cycle', a spontaneous physiological congestion and decongestion of the nasal cavity, compounds the challenge in characterising and assessing nasal patency [3] . The impact of the 'nasal cycle' can be mitigated by measuring nasal airflow following therapeutic nasal decongestion [3] .",

            "text": "On the sidewalls of the nose are 'turbinates', tissue structures which are rich in blood vessels and glands. Often when the septum narrows one side of the nose, it creates a larger space on the other side, into which the turbinate on that side expands. Medical management using topical nasal steroid sprays decongests the nasal lining and may lead to improvement in the symptoms of nasal blockage. However, such treatments are required on a daily, ongoing basis and in practice may not be successful. In addition, side effects of nasal dryness, irritation and bleeding may impact on treatment satisfaction and compliance. When surgery to straighten the septum is carried out, some surgeons also reduce the contralateral turbinate tissue. Potential complications of septoplasty include septal perforation, septal adhesions and bleeding [4] . Post-operative pain is common although this is reduced if sutures rather than nasal packing are used [4] [5] [6] . Patients typically are advised to take several days off work or usual activities after the operation. Septoplasty has no defined selection criteria, particularly in patients whose principal symptoms are sleep related, and clinical practice varies in different centres. The mode of action of septoplasty in sleep-related breathing disorders is not fully understood [7] [8] [9] .",

Where septoplasty fails and further surgery becomes necessary, revision rates are reported to be high [14] . There is also a lack of robust evidence about the additional benefit of turbinate surgery [11] . One study showed reduced revision rates for septoplasty when the turbinate tissue is reduced [15] ; other studies report no added long-term benefit from turbinate reduction [16] [17] [18] .",

As a pragmatic study, NAIROS does not ask surgeons to change their usual practice in relation to contralateral turbinate reduction. NAIROS surgeons may or may not carry out unilateral turbinate surgery on the wider side, according to their assessment of the individual patient airway.

SNOT-22 is a commonly employed patient reported outcome measure in the assessment of patients with pathologies of the nose and sinuses [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] and was first applied to septoplasty in 2003 [31] . Our PPI work found that patient symptoms mapped better to the SNOT-22 than to the NOSE and that patients preferred the SNOT-22 measure. To maximise collection of primary outcome measure, participants who cannot attend the 6-month follow-up visit may complete SNOT-22 by post.",

Contemporaneous field notes from non-participant observation in clinical settings will be edited to ensure anonymity of participants. Data will be managed using NVivo software.

We will undertake independent coding and crosschecking and a proportion of data will be analysed collectively in 'data clinics' where the research team share and exchange interpretations of key issues emerging from the data. Audio-recorded recruitment consultations will be subjected to content, thematic and novel analytical approaches, including targeted conversation analysis [52] and quanti-qual appointment timing (the 'Q-Qat method') [53] . There will be a focus on aspects of information provision that is unclear, disrupted, or potentially detrimental to recruitment and informed consent.",
