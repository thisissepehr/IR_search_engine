Since the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, China, now there are confirmed cases in multiple countries and there are many health care workers who have been infected while they were unprotected or improperly protected. As the 2019-nCoV is highly contagious and the transmission dynamics is still not fully understood [1] , in large hospitals, such as Sichuan provincial people's hospital which has more than 4000 beds and a large number of outpatient visits every day, it was necessary to establish a hospital-specific protocol to deal with the new coronavirus infection. January 17, 2020: the Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital officially launched the 2019 influenza emergency response plan and established a leading group for influenza prevention and control. The president of Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital serves as the team leader, and its members include related departments such as the administrative department, the intensive care unit, the infectious disease department, the respiratory department, nurses, the nosocomial infection control department and the radiology department. Afterwards we established multiple working groups: the emergency team, the prevention and control team, the medical emergency team, the material security team, the publicity and education team and the information updating team. Since the transmission dynamics were unclear, establishing fever clinics, isolation wards and emergency wards were the most important measures.",

The infectious disease physician, the respiratory physician and an emergency medical physician became a fever diagnosis and screening team to triage the patients who have fever. The specific flowchart is shown in Fig. 1 . For highly suspected patients, the rule is to enter the isolation ward and wait for the results of the New Coronavirus nucleic acid test and of the radiology examination. If the suspected patient is confirmed, then he enters the emergency ward for treatment. During the screening process, the medical staff must wear masks, wash their hands and put on isolation clothes to make sure not to be infected by 2019-nCoV carriers. The opening of the online clinics has reduced the number of common flu patients visiting hospitals, and consultation can be conducted at the online clinics.",

The objectives are: (1) to reduce the flow of personnel and reduce the chance of infection; (2) to save medical supplies and ensure that front-line medical staff who fight the 2019-nCoV have protective supplies available.",

On January 25, 2020, the enhanced biosafety secondary laboratory project was launched. It took 6 days for the construction and 2 days for the adjustment. It was officially put into use on February 4, 2020. The enhanced biosafety secondary laboratory is particularly suitable for related operations that pose pathogenic microorganisms threats to humans or the environment. In addition, we have established a special radiology examination route to perform X-ray or CT examinations for highly suspected and confirmed patients, thus reducing the chance of crossinfection with other patients, and protecting the safety of medical staff. We used the ultrasound to evaluate the pulmonary disease, if necessary, so that we can reduce the risk of infection transmission among patients being transported.",

This is not only a huge challenge for medical resources, but also a huge psychological pressure on medical staff, so strict isolation and protection measures are top priority. Also, the epidemic period coincided with the Chinese New Year, and a large number of people returned to work from outside the hospital's region. Therefore, it is particularly important to conduct epidemiological screening of medical staff, especially enquiring about any Wuhan travel history and contact history with Wuhan people. We prepared a form and sent it to the WeChat group, asking each employee, as well as interns and residents, to report their epidemiological history. Once there was a high-risk or suspected person, strict isolation was required for 14 days. Training was carried out on hand hygiene, wearing isolation gowns, how to take nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and environmental disinfection through online video or WeChat. We also introduced robotic systems to deliver meals and supplies to patients, reducing contact between medical staff and carriers, and reducing the chance of infection. We introduced a strictly control at the gates of the hospital, divided into the staff entrance and the patient entrance, and automatically monitor the temperature for everyone who enters the hospital.",
