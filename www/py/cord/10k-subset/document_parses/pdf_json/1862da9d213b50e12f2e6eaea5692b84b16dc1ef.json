While the ultimate goal of showing the efficacy of these pharmacological interventions remains elusive, the definitions elaborated then and now in widespread use did provide the impetus for conducting several epidemiological studies aimed at better characterising the septic syndromes and their sequelae.

In these surveys including all hospital wards, the prevalence of SIRS was about twice higher (64 % and 61 %) in the 3 wards participating in the incidence study than that recorded in the 27 other wards (25 % and 27 %) ( Table 2 ).

and ward population at 8 academic tertiary care medical centres[8] by studying all ICU patients and a random sample of non-ICU patients having had blood cultures drawn during a 15month period. They found that at least 2 of 3 criteria for SIRS were present in 44 % of 15 515 surveillance episodes among 12 759 patients. Of these episodes, 25 % eventually had clinically or microbiologically documented infection (i. e., sepsis). The authors estimated the incidence of SIRS at 18 % of all admissions to these 8 centres, or 27/1000 patient-days(Table 2). In ICUs, 40 % patients fulfilled criteria for SIRS, half of which qualified for sepsis. In non-ICU patients, sepsis was more frequent in patients fulfilling criteria for SIRS, occurring in 67 % of patients. However, it should be noted that only 70 % of non-ICU patients with positive blood cultures had SIRS, pointing to a suboptimal sensitivity of those criteria for bacteraemic infection.Other studies have confirmed the very high incidence of SIRS in various categories of ICU patients. Pittet et al.[9] published a separate analysis of a cohort of 170 patients derived from the surgical ICU studied at Iowa during a one-month period: 158 (93 %) had SIRS at some point in time, with an incidence density of SIRS of 840 per 1000 patient-days; 49 % of patients had sepsis; and 16 % had severe sepsis.
