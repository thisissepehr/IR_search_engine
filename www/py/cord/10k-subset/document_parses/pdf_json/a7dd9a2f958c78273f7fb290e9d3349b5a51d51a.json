Earlier work [M. Freistadt, H. Fleit, and E. Wimmer, Virology 195:798-803 (1993)] showed that the cellular receptor for poliovirus is present in 87% of primary human monocytes and that peripheral blood mononuclear cells support poliovirus replication. In the current work, monocytes, obtained by adherence or by a novel negative selection procedure using specific monoclonal antibodies to lymphocyte surface antigens, supported poliovirus replication. However, total virus yield was low and infectious centers assays revealed that a minority (6%) of monocytes become productively infected. Viral yield from monocytes was lower than from the heterogeneous mononuclear cells; however, when uninfected lymphocytes were added back to infected monocytes, the higher viral yield was restored. The purity of the cells did not significantly affect the number of cells infected. These results suggest that more poliovirus is produced per cell from activated rather than unactivated monocytes. Furthermore, poliovirus replication in monocytes may reflect genuine in vivo replication and comprise a system in which to determine molecular mediators of poliovirus tissue tropism.",

However, due to the surprising complexity of the PVR gene, mRNAs and proteins produced [18, 26, 27] , this information is currently incomplete. Published reports suggest that PVR expression in human tissues is either ubiquitous [9, 18, 27] or greatly exceeds poliovirus replication sites [36] . However, the localization of cell-bound PVR in human tissues has not been precisely determined. Previous studies have relied upon homogenization methods that do not distinguish cell type within tissues and probably contain heterogeneous cell types [9, 18, 27] , used probes that do not distinguish between the isoforms of PVR [36] , some of which are secreted [18] or utilized transgenic mice tissues, rather than human tissues [20, 36] . The possibility that PVR expression exceeds the tissue-specific replication of poliovirus, led to the invocation of a model for another cellular factor limiting poliovirus replication in vivo. Identification of a variant of CD44 (AF3CD44H) [40] as the cognate antigen of AF3 [-41] , a mAb that inhibits binding of poliovirus, types 1 and 2, to the cell surface, suggested that CD44 and PVR may be in a complex and that this complex would delineate poliovirus tissue-specific replication. However, preliminary studies suggest that while Av3CD44H may have a role in poliovirus uptake, it is likely not to be the molecular determinant of poliovirus tissue tropism (Freistadt and Eberle, submitted) .",

PVR is expressed on the cell surface of 87% of CD14positive mononuclear cells from human peripheral blood [8] . CD14 is the LPS receptor and, in this cell population, is a specific marker for monocytes [49] . The presence of PVR in human blood cells may explain the apparent ubiquity of PVR expression [9, 18, 27] . Earlier work demonstrated that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), a heterogeneous population consisting of lymphocytes, monocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, support poliovirus replication [8] , although the specific cell type supporting poliovirus replication was not determined. Although PVR-positive cells have not been detected within primary lymphocytes in our work, it is possible that a small population of such cells escaped detection and contributes to poliovirus replication within PBMCs. Furthermore, it is theoretically possible that an alternate receptor was active for poliovirus replication in the earlier experiments [8] . However, D171, a blocking anti-PVR antibody [30] , fully inhibited poliovirus replication in PBMCs (Freistadt and Eberle, submitted).",

This system may be useful to address the unsolved questions regarding the molecular mediators of poliovirus tissue tropism. We have deliberately chosen not to use specific growth factors to maintain the cultures, because this may induce PVR expression [10] . The disadvantage of this system is that because the cells are not transformed, many monocytes do not survive regardless of viral infection. Nevertheless, for a number of reasons, we believe this system is representative of poliovirus tissue tropism and that increases in viral titer represent genuine viral replication, not sloughing of bound virus. First, primary cells, resistant to poliovirus, require at least 24 h of culturing to become susceptible [36] . In contrast, poliovirus replication in PVR-positive, primary human blood cells occurs within 24 h of removal from the body, strongly suggesting that the cells were susceptible prior to the experimental infection. Second, if poliovirus was merely binding to PVR on monocytes and eluting off, it would not be detected by plaque assay because the specific interaction of PVR and poliovirus results in an irreversible conformational change that inactivates poliovirus [-11, 13, 16] . Third, we have determined that there are significant strain-specific differences in the ability of poliovirus to replicate in monocytes in our system (unpubl. obs.).",

The dilutions include a concentration such that if low number of cells were infected, each infected monocyte sample would yield countable plaques (about 50 per 6cm dish).

Each fraction of cells (PBMCs, adherent or nonadherent fraction) was separately infected with poliovirus at an moi of 10. A high moi was used to ensure that the maximum number of cells were infected. However, rigorous rinsing was then required to remove unbound virus, which was the majority of the input virus. The titers at time zero (residual virus, either loosely bound or not yet penetrated) tend to differ for the various fractions. This is likely to be due to the differing number of cells that express PVR in the various fractions, since residual virus correlates with PVR levels (unpubl. obs.). Samples were withdrawn at daily intervals and titered in a separate plaque assay on Hela cells (Fig. 1) . Control infections of unfractionated PBMCs supported poliovirus replication, as previously demonstrated [8] : the adherent cells also supported poliovirus replication, while the nonadherent cells did not support poliovirus replication. Although we are here concerned primarily with viral replication that occurs within 24 h of extravasation, a timecourse over 5 days is shown in Fig. 1 : data for the first day only is presented for subsequent studies. Increases in poliovirus titer from PBMCs is generally 2-10 fold within 24 h, although there is significant donor-to-donor variation. The extent of fractionation by adherence was assessed by immunofluorescence staining using lineage-specific markers followed by flow cytometric analysis. The starting material (Ficoll-purified PBMCs) was 32.9% CD14-positive (mean of 9 measurements, 23.3-41.6% range), the adherent cells contained 62.4% CD14-positive cells (mean of 5 measurements, 53.8-75.8% range), while the nonadherent cells contained 17.1% CD14 (mean of 4 measurements, 8.8-25.7% range). Therefore, adherent cells, which are greatly enriched for monocytes, can support poliovirus replication. However, the nonadherent cells, which contain a small amount of contaminating CD14-positive cells, occasionally supported a low level of poliovirus replication. This is likely to be due to the contaminating CD14-positive cells in the nonadherent fraction. However, it is possible that it may be due to other causes. It is possible that there is a small population of PVR-positive cells that are not monocytes: we have no evidence for this in primary blood cells. In addition, it is theoretically possible that there is an alternate receptor for poliovirus replication in primary human tissues. However, D171, a blocking anti-PVR antibody [30] , fully inhibited poliovirus replication in PBMCs (Freistadt and Eberle, submitted). To address these issues, an improved cell fractionation procedure was developed.",

Several attempts to use this method to derive a pure population of monocytes capable of supporting poliovirus replication were not successful. This was probably due to the long time periods that were required to fractionate the relatively low abundance monocytes and to the resulting reduced viability of the purified cells. An alternate procedure that uses negative selection by paramagnetic beads to separate specific antibodies was developed. A positive selection was not used to avoid possible interference of the antibodies with subsequent infection. The non-CD14-positive cell population in PBMCs consists of CD19 (pan B marker)-and CD2 (pan T and NK marker)-positive cells. Therefore, we used specific monoclonal antibodies to these lineage-specific markers in a negative selection procedure that leaves CD 14-positive cells intact. The cells were assessed for purity using a non-specific esterase histological stain [22, 50] because residual antibodies from the fractionation interfere with immunofluorescence staining. This histological stain is specific for monocytes. Using this method, negatively selected monocytes, that were 73% pure, were obtained (Table 1) . These monocytes supported poliovirus replication, while lymphocytes (negatively selected using an mAb to CD 14) were not able to support poliovirus replication (Table 2 ). There was donor-to-donor variation in the initial titers (Day 0). Therefore, fold-increase was used to calculate and compare extent of viral replication. These data strongly support the interpretation that within PBMCs, CD14-positive cells exclusively support poliovirus replication. 107 Ficoll-purified PBMCs, monocytes negatively selected with anti-lymphocyte mAbs or lymphocytes negatively selected with anti-monocyte mAbs (both from 10 v Ficoll-purified PBMCs) were infected with poliovirus, rinsed thoroughly to remove unbound virus and the indicated samples titered in a standard plaque assay on Hela cells. Viral yield is expressed as pfus/ml; fold increase over the first 24 h was calculated by dividing pfus/ml for Day 1 by that for Day 0. For each fraction, the fold-increase is averaged ",

Using these two assays, we identified monocytes as the exclusive cell type within PBMCs supporting poliovirus replication. Preliminary dual staining experiments of infected PBMCs for viral antigens and cell surface markers support this interpretation (unpubl. obs.). Virus yield from separated monocytes was lower than that from PBMCs. Infectious centers assays revealed while that a minority of cells, under either condition, supports poliovirus replication, more virus per cell is produced from the heterogeneous population. Higher total viral yield was restored when infected monocytes were mixed with uninfected lymphocytes, suggesting that interactions between monocytes and lymphocytes may affect poliovirus replication. Primary human cells were used in this study to avoid culture conditions that alter poliovirus susceptibility. However, primary cells are difficult to work with: there was donor-to-donor variability in the ability of monocytes to support poliovirus replication. Whether this is due to intrinsic differences between individuals or subtle differences is presently difficult to determine. It is possible Various cell fractions were infected with poliovirus, rinsed thoroughly to remove unbound virus and samples titered in a standard plaque assay on Hela cells at Day 0 and Day 1. Primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, adherent cells, nonadherent cells were infected: the last set represents infected adherent cells mixed with uninfected nonadherent cells. Viral yield is expressed as pfus/ml; fold increase over the first 24h was calculated by dividing pfus/ml for day 1 by that for day 0. Data are from 9 separate experiments. For each fraction, average and standard deviation of fold-increase is presented that genetic differences mediating differential susceptibility to poliovirus in epidemics, if they exist, are mediated by differences in the ability of an individual's monocytes to support poliovirus replication. A possible area of difference may be levels of PVR; however, with only one exception, we have not detected donor-to-donor differences in the levels of PVR on monocytes. A retrospective study of poliomyelitis victims may be required to address this issue. The levels of viral replication are very low: both in terms of percentage of infected cells and yield per cell. It is possible that, if viral replication in humans occurs in monocytes and macrophages, it is at these low levels. This is in contrast to tissue culture systems that have been optimized for viral production. The poliovirus replication cycle in monocytes appears to be slower than in Hela cells (about eight hours): kinetic studies are planned for the future. Preliminary experiments suggest that during the timecourse of the experiments presented here (1-5 days) multiple rounds of replication are not occurring (unpubl. obs.). Whether the infection is lytic has not been determined: too few cells are infected to observe lysis visually. If a persistent infection is being initiated, it would not be detected in these experiments because these primary cells are not immortal. However, persistent infection in macrophages may be relevant to the pathogenesis of Post-Polio Syndrome. It is of interest that poliovirus persistent infection has been reported in a hematopoietic cell line [23] .",

However, when one calculates the number of cells infected from the same starting material (1 x 107 PBMCs), taking into account the difference in PVR-positive cells between the two populations, the values for number of infected cells within PBMCs and fractionated monocytes do not differ greatly (footnote, Table 3 ). Of interest, however, is the higher virus yield per infected cells obtained from PBMCs, especially when virus yield per cell is considered (Table 3) . Mixing infected adherent cells with uninfected nonadherent cells restored the higher level of viral replication. It is possible that under certain conditions, nonmonocytes support poliovirus replication, although there is no evidence for this. Alternatively, enhancement of virus yield per infected cell may be due to an interaction between monocytes and lymphocytes. Preliminary results suggest that PHA increases viral replication (unpubl. obs.). Since PHA is a lymphocyte mitogen, this could be due to the lymphocyte secretion of cytokines that activate monocytes. The finding that 7-IFN increases PVR expression in the absence of poliovirus [10] may provide a mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon. Recent reports that levels of receptor can mediate differences in susceptibility support this interpretation [19] . It was not possible to correlate PV susceptibility with PVR expression on a cellular level in the present work because D171 (an anti-PVR mAb recognizing the poliovirus binding site) does not detect PVR during a poliovirus infection. Other effects of activation may be responsible as well. This can be tested by adding activated lymphocyte culture supernatant or purified cytokines to monocytes and determining whether this affects virus yield per cell. Alternatively, the enhanced virus yield could be due to direct cell-cell contact between different cell types. Within PBMCs, it may be that susceptible monocytes are already activated: differences in monocyte activation between donors may explain the differences in extent of poliovirus replication between people.",

Our ability to detect poliovirus replication in PVR-positive, primary human blood cells within 24 h suggests that the cells were susceptible prior to the experimental infection. Although our studies have focused on monocytes, it is likely that macrophages K.E. Eberle et at. also support poliovirus replication in vivo. In vitro generated macrophages support poliovirus replication, but since changes occur in the cells during the culturing, this does not shed light on whether primary human macrophages support poliovirus replication.

Although it has long been known that poliovirus replicates in oropharyngeal and intestinal mucosa [3] , the specific cell type carrying out the primary round of viral replication has not been identified. Furthermore, whether the replication occurs during or after crossing the gut barrier is not clear. There is recent, indirect evidence that poliovirus can be trans-cytosed across the epithelial layer by M cells, suggesting that the initial uptake is nonspecific and does not include a round of replication [42] . In this case, resident mononuclear phagocytic cells in the Peyer's Patches may support initial rounds of poliovirus replication, similar to a hypothesized scheme for reovirus pathogenesis [48] . This suggests that after nonspecific entry into mucosal associated lymph tissue (MALT), resident macrophages may be the specific cell type that carries out the primary round of poliovirus replication. The virus produced could be shed into the blood, causing plasma viremia [28] . However, it is possible that monocytes in the blood may also become infected and shed additional virus into the blood. Additionally, myeloid cells in MALT may be one of the elusive \"extraneural\" sites of viral replication that is responsible for continued shedding of poliovirus into feces after viremia has been cleared [4] .",

Another unresolved question in poliovirus pathogenesis has been how the virus enters the CNS. There is evidence for two routes: direct crossing of the blood brain barrier [29] or retrograde transfer after replication in peripheral tissues [37] . Furthermore, there are strain-specific differences in the route viruses use [29] . Our work suggests a third possible, though not necessarily exclusive, route: in nonimmune individuals, monocytes may carry the virus into the CNS when they diapedese and differentiate into microglia. The early finding that specific antisera rapidly cleared plasma viremia [28] is not inconsistent with such a route because in the presence of antibody, poliovirus enters monocytes via Fc receptors and is rapidly degraded (unpubl. obs.). In an immune individual, presumably antibody would clear virus before significant numbers of blood monocytes are infected. Direct testing of this may require an animal model.",

Data are from 3 separate experiments: \u2022 viral yield from 107 Ficoll-purified PBMCs; [] viral yield from adherent cells from 107 Ficoll-purified PBMCs;/k viral yield from nonadherent cells from 107 Ficollpurified PBMCs",
