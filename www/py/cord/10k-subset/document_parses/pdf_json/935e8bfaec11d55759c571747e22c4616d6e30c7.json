In patients with IHCA, 2D echocardiography has been shown to facilitate the rapid detection or exclusion of various aetiologies during the peri-resuscitative period and to help physicians identify targets for possible correction 9 . Furthermore, 2D echocardiography is useful for the diagnosis and treatment of post-arrest myocardial dysfunction (PAMD), a common condition affecting patients who achieve return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after IHCA 10-12 . Accordingly, 2D echocardiography may be useful for improving post-ROSC survival for patients who undergo ICPR for IHCA. However, available information related to this topic remains insufficient. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the association between in-hospital survival and the performance of 2D echocardiography within 24 hours after ROSC in patients who underwent ICPR after IHCA.

A total of 3,066 cases of IHCA were recorded at the study institution from January 2005 to December 2018. Of these, 454 cases involving paediatric patients and 735 cases involving repeated events of IHCA for a single patient during the study period were excluded. Accordingly, 1,887 patients with a first IHCA event were initially screened for study inclusion. Of those, 1,115 achieved ROSC after ICPR. After excluding 42 patients who underwent ICPR in the emergency department and 23 patients whose ICPR information was incomplete or missing, 1,050 patients were stratified according to their 2D echocardiography status. Eligible patients who underwent 2D echocardiography were assigned to the 2D-echo group, and those who did not undergo 2D echocardiography were assigned to the non-2D-echo group. The initial 2D-echo and non-2D-echo groups included 145 (13.8%) and 905 patients (86.2%), respectively. After PS matching, 142 and 284 patients remained in the 2D-echo and non-2D-echo groups, respectively (Fig. 1 ). The baseline characteristics of patients included in the analyses before and after PS matching are shown in Table 1 . After PS matching, all covariates were well-balanced between the 2D-echo and non-2D-echo groups, with an absolute value of the standardised mean difference (ASD) of <0.1. The PS distributions of the two groups were also similar, as demonstrated by a comparison between pre-and post-PS values (Fig. S1 ). Table 2 presents the results of a comparative analysis for in-hospital survival between the 2D-echo and non-2D-echo groups before and after PS matching. In the PS-matched cohort, 49.3% (70/142) of patients in the 2D-echo group survived to discharge from the hospital, compared to only 29.2% (83/284) of those in the non-2D-echo group. In a logistic regression analysis of the PS-matched cohort, the in-hospital survival rate in patients in the 2D-echo group was 2.35-fold higher than that in patients in the non-2D-echo group (odds ratio [OR]: 2.35, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.55-3.57; P < 0.001). A multivariable logistic regression analysis of the entire cohort similarly revealed that the in-hospital survival rate in patients in the 2D-echo group was 2.26-fold higher than that in patients in the non-2D-echo group (OR: 2.26, 95% CI: 1.53-3.34; P < 0.001; Fig. 2 ). Table 3 presents the differences in in-hospital survival between the PS-matched 2D-echo and non-2D-echo groups according to the aetiology of IHCA. When the aetiology of IHCA was cardiac arrest of a cardiac cause (n = 336), the in-hospital survival rate in patients in the 2D-echo group was 2.51-fold higher than that in patients in the non-2D echo group (OR: 2.51, 95% CI: 1.56-4.04; P < 0.001).

However, a subgroup analysis revealed that this association was only evident if the IHCA had a cardiac aetiology. This finding, which was demonstrated using both PS matching and multivariable-adjusted analyses of the entire cohort, is significant, because it suggests that 2D echocardiography should be performed within 24 hours of ROSC after IHCA to allow physicians to make more appropriate treatment decisions. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Our findings raise several points. First, and most importantly, PAMD was unlikely to be detected in patients who did not undergo 2D echocardiography within 24 hours after ROSC [10] [11] [12] . As rapid 2D echocardiography is required for the diagnosis of possible PAMD during the post-arrest period 13 , patients in our study who did not undergo 2D echocardiography within 24 hours were less likely to receive appropriate treatment for this condition. Second, 2D echocardiography can facilitate the rapid diagnosis or elimination of reversible causes of IHCA 9 , such as acute cardiac tamponade 14 , myocardial infarction 15 , or pulmonary embolism 16 . Therefore, such causes may not have been identified in patients who did not undergo 2D echocardiography (i.e., those in the non-2D echo group), whereas patients in the 2D-echo group were more likely to benefit from rapid detection and treatment. Third, 2D echocardiography may have helped to improve the quality of post-arrest care in patients with IHCA due to non-cardiac causes (e.g., sepsis or hypovolemia). Consistent with this possibility, 2D echocardiography has been reported to facilitate the management of septic and hypovolemic shock 7, 8, 17 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 861, "end": 865, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 866, "end": 870, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 871, "end": 875, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 984, "end": 986, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1334, "end": 1336, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1883, "end": 1885, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1886, "end": 1888, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1889, "end": 1891, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our findings directly contrast those of Jentzer et al., who reported that 2D echocardiographic findings (e.g., left ventricular ejection fraction) obtained within 24 hours after ROSC were not useful predictors of survival 18 .

Our study included every patient who achieved ROSC after ICPR for IHCA, regardless of their 2D echocardiography status within 24 hours, and differences in survival to discharge were compared between the 2D-echo and non-2D-echo groups.
