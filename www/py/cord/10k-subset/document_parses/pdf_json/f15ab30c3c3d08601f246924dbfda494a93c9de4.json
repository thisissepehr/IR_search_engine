The regulation of translation is a mechanism that is used to modulate gene expression in a wide range of biological situations. From early embryonic development to cell differentiation and metabolism, translation is used to fine-tune protein levels in both time and space 1,2 . However, although many examples have been described, much remains to be learned about the molecular mechanisms of translational control. Two general modes of control can be envisaged -global control, in which the translation of most mRNAs in the cell is regulated; and mRNA-specific control, whereby the translation of a defined group of mRNAs is modulated without affecting general protein biosynthesis or the translational status of the cellular transcriptome as a whole. Global regulation mainly occurs by the modification of translation-initiation factors, whereas mRNAspecific regulation is driven by regulatory protein complexes that recognize particular elements that are usually present in the 5\u2032 and/or 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) of the target mRNA. Recently, it has been found that mRNA translation can also be regulated by small MICRO RNAS (miRNAs) that hybridize to mRNA sequences that are frequently located in the 3\u2032 UTR.",

However, as direct physical evidence for scanning intermediates remains to be found, scanning is probably a rapid process that involves unstable intermediates. Translation initiation requires energy in the form of ATP. It is unknown whether this energy is used to unwind secondary structures in the 5\u2032 UTR to allow binding of the 43S complex, and/or to directly promote movement of the 43S complex. However, scanning of unstructured leaders can occur in the absence of ATP in vitro, which indicates that the movement of a 43S complex along the mRNA might not require energy unless the ribosome encounters a stable structure in the mRNA 11 . eIF1 and eIF1A contribute to the processivity of scanning 11, 12 . Although it is unclear at present whether the 43S complex remains physically associated with the cap structure during scanning, the eIF4F complex has been shown to support scanning 11 . Binding of the 43S complex to the initiator codon AUG results in the formation of a stable complex, which is referred to as the 48S initiation complex. Selection of the correct initiation codon critically depends on eIF1 (REFS 11, 12) . There is also an alternative mode of translation initiation that is independent of the cap structure and is mediated by IRESs, which are RNA structures that help to recruit ribosomal complexes to internal sites of the 5\u2032 UTR, sometimes directly at, or near, the initiation codon 5 (FIG. 1) .",

Whereas the elongation and termination phases are assisted by a limited set of dedicated factors, translation initiation in eukaryotes is a complex event that is assisted by more than 25 polypeptides 4,5,6 . Translation initiation involves the positioning of an elongation-competent 80S ribosome at the initiation codon (AUG). The small (40S) ribosomal subunit initially binds to the 5\u2032 end of the mRNA and scans it in a 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 direction until the initiation codon is identified. The large (60S) ribosomal subunit then joins the 40S subunit at this position to form the catalytically competent 80S ribosome (FIG. 2) . Here we provide a succinct overview of the process of translation initiation as far as it is directly relevant for the examples of translational regulation that are discussed below. For a more detailed description of the translation-initiation process, see The small ribosomal subunit, together with other factors, forms a 43S pre-initiation complex that binds to the mRNA. This 43S assembly contains the EUKARY-OTIC INITIATION FACTORS (eIFs) 3, 1, 1A and 5, and a ternary complex, which comprises the methionine-loaded initiator tRNA that will recognize the AUG codon during initiation and eIF2 that is coupled to GTP (FIG. 2) . At least in mammals, binding of the 43S pre-initiation complex to the mRNA is thought to involve bridging interactions between eIF3 and the eIF4F protein complex, which associates with the 5\u2032 cap structure of the mRNA 7 . The eIF4F complex contains several proteins, which include: eIF4E, which physically binds to the m 7 GpppN cap structure; eIF4A, a DEAD-BOX RNA HELICASE that is believed to unwind secondary structures in the As mentioned above, eIF2 is part of the ternary complex and associates with the small ribosomal subunit in its GTP-bound form. This GTP is hydrolyzed when the initiator AUG is recognized during translation initiation, producing eIF2 in the GDP-bound state. Exchange of GDP for GTP on eIF2 is catalyzed by eIF2B and is required to reconstitute a functional ternary complex for a new round of translation initiation 15 (FIG. 3a) . eIF2 consists of three subunits -\u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 -and phosphorylation of the \u03b1 subunit at residue Ser51 blocks the GTP-exchange reaction by reducing the dissociation rate of eIF2 from eIF2B. In effect, this sequesters eIF2B 16 and, as a consequence, GDP-GTP exchange no longer occurs and global mRNA translation is inhibited.",

Here we discuss The methionine-loaded initiator tRNA (L-shaped symbol) binds to GTP-coupled eIF2, to yield the ternary complex. This complex then binds to the small (40S) ribosomal subunit, eIF3 and other initiation factors to form the 43S pre-initiation complex. The pre-initiation complex recognizes the mRNA by the binding of eIF3 to the eIF4G subunit of the cap-binding complex. In addition to eIF4G, the cap-binding complex contains eIF4E, which directly binds to the cap, and eIF4A, an RNA helicase that unwinds secondary structure during the subsequent step of scanning. eIF4G also contacts the poly(A)binding protein (PABP) and this interaction is thought to circularize the mRNA. The 43S pre-initiation complex scans the mRNA in a 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 direction until it identifies the initiator codon AUG. Scanning is assisted by the factors eIF1 and eIF1A. Stable binding of the 43S pre-initiation complex to the AUG codon yields the 48S initiation complex. Subsequent joining of the large (60S) ribosomal subunit results in the formation of the 80S initiation complex. Both AUG recognition and joining of the large ribosomal subunit trigger GTP hydrolysis on eIF2 and eIF5B, respectively. Subsequently, the 80S complex is competent to catalyze the formation of the first peptide bond.

To repress translation, CPEB binds a protein known as Maskin that contains an eIF4E-binding domain, which resembles the one in eIF4G 30 .As such, the CPEB-Maskin complex can be considered to be an 'mRNA-specific 4E-BP' (FIG. 4b) . The affinity of isolated Maskin for eIF4E is apparently lower than that of eIF4G, but a Maskin peptide that includes the eIF4E-binding domain can inhibit translation in vivo, which suggests that Maskin indeed competes with eIF4G for binding to eIF4E 30 .",

The RNA-binding proteins hnRNP K (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K) and hnRNP E1 inhibit the translation of 15-lipoxygenase (LOX) mRNA during early erythroid differentiation. They bind to a repeated CU-rich element, which is known as the differentiation-control element (DICE) that is located in the LOX 3\u2032 UTR. Translational repression of LOX is independent of the poly(A) tail and also occurs when translation is driven in a cap-independent manner by the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) or the classical swine fever virus (CSVF) IRESs, which indicates that this type of regulation targets a late step in initiation 43, 44 . Sucrose-gradient analysis showed that 48S-complex formation occurred, but formation of the 80S ribosome was inhibited by the hnRNP-K-hnRNP-E1 complex. Furthermore, toe-printing analysis revealed that the 43S complex was placed at the initiator AUG codon on the silenced mRNA. So, these regulators seem to prevent the binding of the 60S ribosomal subunit to the 40S subunit at the initiation codon 44 (FIG. 5a) . In principle, hnRNP-K-hnRNP-E1 could achieve this either by interfering with a translation-initiation factor that is involved in this step, or by directly inhibiting the interaction between the two ribosomal subunits. However, hnRNP-K-hnRNP-E1 regulation is bypassed when the translation of a DICE-containing RNA is driven by the cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) IRES. As this IRES does not require any of the known translationinitiation factors, this finding suggests that hnRNP-K-hnRNP-E1 targets the initiation factors rather than the ribosomal subunits themselves 44 . However, it is not clear at present which initiation factor (or factors) represents the primary target of regulation.",

To carry out this function, Sxl binds to specific sites in both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs of msl-2 mRNA and recruits co-repressors to the 3\u2032 UTR 36, 37 (FIG. 4c) .

This increases the number of small ribosomal subunits that continue to scan to the initiation codon of GCN4, and provides an opportunity to bind an active ternary complex on the way. Therefore, an increased number of recharged ribosomal subunits reaches the GCN4 initiation codon, which explains the paradoxical increase in GCN4 translation when eIF2\u03b1 is phosphorylated (FIG. 5b) . A related mechanism is used to upregulate ATF4 mRNA translation in mammals. ATF4 is a transcriptional activator the expression of which is induced by several stress signals, including amino-acid starvation.

Binding of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) and hnRNP E1 to the differentiation-control element (DICE) in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of LOX mRNA prevents the 60S subunit from joining the 48S initiation complex at the initiator AUG codon. b | Mechanism of regulation of GCN4 mRNA translation. GCN4 mRNA contains four upstream open reading frames (uORF1-4). Under conditions of amino-acid sufficiency (upper panel), reinitiation occurs more frequently after each uORF (continuous arrow), because of an increased probability of recharging the scanning 40S subunits that traverse the regions between the uORFs with active ternary complexes. As a result, reinitiation at the GCN4 ORF becomes infrequent (dashed arrow). Under conditions of amino-acid scarcity, which induces eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, and low levels of ternary complex (lower panel), reinitiation is unlikely to occur at the uORFs. This increases the probability of scanning 40S subunits reaching the region downstream of uORF4 and, subsequently, the GCN4 AUG initiation codon. The asterisk indicates that the exact composition of the 43S pre-initiation complex, in the context of reinitiation, is not known. degradation -is based on the degree of complementarity between the small mRNA molecule and the mRNA target, as target mRNA that was modified to base pair perfectly with an authentic miRNA was degraded 54, 55 . Even though miRNAs and siRNAs arise from different precursors, they share common processing steps (BOX 1) . The miRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein (miRNP) particle contains proteins of the Argonaute family, which are also found in the siRNP 56 . However, it is unclear at present whether the molecular entities that catalyse mRNA degradation and translational repression are the same and, if not, to what extent they differ. The mechanism of translational repression by miRNAs is largely unknown. Translational repression of lin-14 mRNA by lin-4 miRNA did not alter its association with polysomes, which indicates that lin-4 inhibits the elongation and/or termination of translation 57 (FIG. 6) . Furthermore, C. elegans ribosomes that are associated with a repressed lin-14 mRNA were able to continue translation when incubated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, which indicates that ribosomes are not permanently stalled on the repressed MESSENGER RIBONUCLEOPROTEIN (mRNP) 58 . More definitive mechanistic insights are likely to require the establishment of in vitro translation systems that completely recapitulate the translational block that is imposed by miRNAs. It also remains to be determined whether translational repression by miRNAs requires proteins that recognize the mRNA-miRNA hybrid.",

It is now becoming clear that this early work represents the tip of the iceberg of what is emerging as a new field in translational control: the regulation of translation not only by protein factors, but also by small RNA molecules of~22 nucleotides in length that are known as micro RNAs (miRNAs). The first miRNAs to be discovered were lin-4 and let-7, which are crucial for regulating the developmental timing in Caenorhabditis elegans 49 . So far, several hundred miRNAs have been described in plants and animals that regulate a broad spectrum of biological processes, which range from cell metabolism to cell differentiation, cell growth and apoptosis 50,51,52 . miRNAs hybridize by incomplete base-pairing, usually to several sites in the 3\u2032 UTR of target mRNAs. Because the target mRNA remains intact after miRNA binding, the miRNAs are believed to repress translation, rather than prevent translation by degrading the mRNA. miRNA is biochemically indistinguishable from another small RNA species that is known as small interfering RNA (siRNA). siRNAs are double-stranded RNA molecules of 21-23 nucleotides in length, and they mediate the degradation of mRNAs that show perfect complementarity to either of the siRNA strands 53 . Indeed, the functional difference between miRNAs and siRNAs -translational repression versus mRNA RNase III A family of endoribonucleases that cleave double-stranded RNA and have an important role in the maturation of ribosomal RNA, among other processes.

Although the exact composition of RISC and the miRNAcontaining ribonucleoprotein particles (miRNPs) is unknown, both contain proteins of the Argonaute family 56, 65 . This observation, together with the fact that miRNAs can behave as siRNAs, has led some to speculate that RISC might direct both mRNA degradation and translational silencing 54 .
