However, to use this type of data for such purposes it has to be transformed into a coded format to make it computable. Because the cause of death in the certificates is reported as free text, encoding the data is currently the single largest barrier of using death certificates for surveillance. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of using a pipeline, composed of a detection rule and a natural language processor, for the real time encoding of death certificates using the identification of pneumonia and influenza cases as an example and demonstrating that its accuracy is comparable to existing methods. Results: A Death Certificates Pipeline (DCP) was developed to automatically code death certificates and identify pneumonia and influenza cases. The pipeline used MetaMap to code death certificates from the Utah Department of Health for the year 2008. The output of MetaMap was then accessed by detection rules which flagged pneumonia and influenza cases based on the Centers of Disease and Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition. The output from the DCP was compared with the current method used by the CDC and with a keyword search. Recall, precision, positive predictive value and F-measure with respect to the CDC method were calculated for the two other methods considered here. The two different techniques compared here with the CDC method showed the following recall/ precision results: DCP: 0.998/0.98 and keyword searching: 0.96/0.96. The F-measure were 0.99 and 0.96 respectively (DCP and keyword searching).

The surveillance of vital statistics is not a novel idea; mortality surveillance has played an integral part in public health since the London Bills of Mortality were devised in the seventeenth century [3] .

Each week, this system summarizes the total number of death certificates filed in 122 US cities, as well as the number of deaths due to pneumonia and influenza. However, even these data can be delayed by approximately 2-3 weeks from the times of death. This delay can be attributed to one of the following reasons: 1) timeliness of death registration and 2) reviewing of the death certificates to identify pneumonia and influenza deaths [6, 16, 17] . The registration and reviewing of death certificates varies by states and, as a result, there is variability in length of time to report a death to CDC.

To bypass the lengthy NCHS process, a variety of approaches have been attempted that are close to 'realtime' but less than optimal. For instance, in Utah keyword searching is used to identify pneumonia and influenza deaths; although this method is fast and easy to implement, it can easily result in the over or under estimation of cases.

The cause of death literals are coded into International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision (ICD-10) [23] and the underlying and multiplecause-of-death codes are selected based on the World Health Organization coding rules. These coding rules have been automated by CDC with the development the Mortality Medical Data System (MMDS) which consists of four programs: Super Mortality Medical Indexing Classification and Retrieval (SuperMICAR) Data Entry; Mortality Medical Indexing Classification and Retrieval (MICAR); Automated Classification of Medical Entities (ACME) and TRANSAX (Translation Axes). SuperMI-CAR was designed to facilitate the entry of literal text of causes of death in death certificates and convert them into standardized expressions acceptable by MICAR. It contains a dictionary which assigns an entity reference number (ERN) to statements on the death certificate. These ERNs are fed into MICAR200 which transforms the ERNS into ICD-10 codes by using specific mortality coding rules; the rules require look-up files and a dictionary. ACME and TRANSAX then selects the underlying and multiple causes of death respectively. ICD-10 codes from MICAR200 are fed into ACME which assigns the underlying cause of death using decision tables. The decision table contains all possible pairings of diseases for which the first disease can cause the second. In the latest version of the system, ACME is comprised of eight decision tables including three tables of valid and invalid codes, causal relationships (General Principle and Rule 1), and direct sequel (Rule 3), and three other tables needed by modification rules.

MetaMap coded this literal as aspiration pneumonia which was excluded from the CUI code list, but its respective ICD-10 included J189. For the 9 additional cases which were not present in the reference standard, we noticed two categories of errors: 1)cases where the string 'pneumonia' is present in the death literal but not coded into ICD-10 and 2) the reporting of aspiration pneumonia on the death certificate. The first category of errors was not due to MetaMap or the rule algorithm, but perhaps due to the coding process. As described earlier, MMDS produces entity axis and record axis codes. The entity axis codes would be a more appropriate reference standard for they provide the ICD 10 codes for the conditions or events reported as listed by the death certifier and maintains the order as written on the death certificate [43] ; but as noted earlier only the record axis codes were made available for this study. The algorithm used to produce record axis codes from the entity axis data removes duplicate codes and contradictory diagnoses within the entity axis data to produce the more standardized record axis [44] . For example, if a medical examiner reports pneumonia with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease both conditions will be shown in entity axis code data. However, in record axis code data, they will be replaced with a single condition: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute lower respiratory infection (J44.0).

A good recall is required to help capture the 'true' P-I deaths and a good precision is needed to avoidoverestimating the number of P-I deaths. This study also indicated that keyword searching underestimated pneumonia and influenza deaths in Utah. The simple keyword search method not only decreased recall and precision but also reduced the level of agreement. When reporting counts for surveillance purposes it's best to be as accurate as possible; however, there's a trade-off between recall and precision.
