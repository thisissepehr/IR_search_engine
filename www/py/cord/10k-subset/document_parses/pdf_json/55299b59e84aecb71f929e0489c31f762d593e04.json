Positive-and negative-stranded BDV-specific RNA species as well as three virus-specific proteins, known to be present in BDVinfected cell extracts, were demonstrated in these Freon-treated fractions. When the Freon-purified virus preparations were treated with RNase A prior to RNA extraction, only negative-stranded, genomic RNA was detected in Northern blot hybridizations using sense and antisense RNA probes.

            "text": "Borna discase virus (BDV) induces a T cell-mediated immunopathological encephalomyelitis in horses, sheep and a broad range of experimentally infected animal species (Richt et al. 1992) . BDV has only partially been characterized; in particular, virus-like structures have not been visualized in infected tissues. Purification of BDV has not been achieved, probably because the virus is mainly cell-associated, has a relatively low replication rate, and infectivity is low in all types of tissue and cell cultures. The data available suggest that BDV is enveloped, has a diameter of 80-120 nm (Elford and Galloway 1933; Heinig 1969) and has the physical and replicative properties typical for conventional viruses (Ludwig and Becht 1977; Duchala et al. 1989; Richt et al. 1992) . Only recently has it been shown that BDV contains a single-stranded RNA, presumably of 8.5 kilobases (kb) (de la Torre et al. 1990; Lipkin et al. 1990 ) or 10.5 kb (VandeWoude et al. 1990 Richt et al. 1991; Thierer et al. 1992) . The polarity of the genomic RNA has been a matter of controversy. At least three virus-specific proteins were described with molecular mass of 14, 24 and 38/39 kilodalton (kDa) (Sch~idler et al. 1985; Haas et al. 1986; Thiedemann et al. 1992) , respectively.",

The positive-stranded R N A probe hybridized to one R N A o f 10.0kb in Freon-treated material (Fig. 1B,  lane 4) . This means that the only negative-stranded RNA which exists in Freontreated material has a size of 10.0 kb, which can be considered as the size of the genome. Even after digestion with 20 ~tg/ml (Fig. 1 B, lane 3) or 40 ~tg/ml (Fig. 1 B, lane 2) RNase A, the negative-stranded RNA species of 10.0 kb size was still discernible. A smear of smaller, partially degraded BDV-RNAs of both positive and negative orientations were produced after digestion for 2h with RNase A concentrations of 20 ~tg/ml or 40 ~tg/ml. Since it was not clear whether these subgenomic BDV-specific RNA species were merely associated with virus particles, we digested Freon preparations for an extended period of 5 h with 40 ~tg/ml RNase A before RNA isolation and Northern blot hybridization. The results of the respective Northern gels are shown in Fig. 2 .

After 5 h of RNase A digestion, virus-specific positive-stranded RNAs were no longer detectable ( Fig. 2A, lane 2) . In contrast, the positive-stranded RNA probe was bound to a negative-stranded RNA with a size of 10.0kb (Fig2B, lane 2); the smear of subgenomic RNA species found in Fig. 1 B (lanes 2 and 3) had disappeared after this prolonged treatment (Fig. 2b, lane 2) . Comparable results were obtained when Northern blot hybridization of Freon-extracted tissue was carried out with preparations which had been RNAse A digested (40 ~tg/ml for 2 h) and purified in CsC1 gradient centrifugation (data not shown). Therefore, the subgenomic RNA species found in the fractions digested for 2 h with RNase A are apparently not present in the virion particles.",

Transmission electran micrograph of Freon-treated, BDV-infected MDCK cells after negative staining with 2.5% uranyl acetate. Bars-100nm infectivity titers. The structural entity carrying BDV infectivity is, therefore, left intact (Table 1) . Treatment of homogenates derived from BDV-infected brain tissue or cell cultures yielded infectious particles with a buoyant density of 1.16-1.22 g/ml. Comparable results were obtained when Freon treatment was omitted from the purification protocol. All known viral proteins were still present in the infectious preparations after extraction with Freon. This was also true for a multitude of positive-and negative-stranded RNA species which were found in BDV-infected brain tissue or cell cultures before and after treatment with Freon (Figs. 1, 2) . However, after treatment of Freon-purified preparations with RNase A, these samples contained only a negative-stranded RNA species of 10.0 kb (Figs. 1, 2) . The fact that infectivity was not destroyed by digestion with RNase A substantiates the assumption that this RNA represents the viral genome which had been incorporated into particles and remains protected from RNase digestion. Freely accessible genomic RNA would have been destroyed by pancreatic RNase as shown previously (de la Torre et al. 1990 ). From all these findings one can conclude that the particulate structures purified by Freon extraction and density gradient centrifugation carry the elements essential for virus replication, and they are in accordance with the physico-chemical characteristics which had previously been established for BDV (Richt et al. 1992) . It remains uncertain whether the structures depicted in Fig. 4 reflect the virus particles produced by the infected cell, because the virus preparations had undergone treatment with the lipid solvent Freon. Since all three types of viral proteins were present in this Freon-purified material (Fig. 3) , they must represent structural proteins of the virus. Even though these proteins must be part of the viral architecture, none of them seems to be exposed at the surface of the virus-like particles, since they could not be labeled with virus-specific antibodies and immunogold. In spite of the absence of a virus-specific marker, these particles may still be considered as virions if one assumes that the outermost layer consists of cellular material which is devoid of virus-specific proteins. In accordance with this interpretation are the findings that convalescent sera collected after natural or experimental infections do not have any neutralizing capacity (Narayan et al. 1983; Carbone et al. 1987) .",
