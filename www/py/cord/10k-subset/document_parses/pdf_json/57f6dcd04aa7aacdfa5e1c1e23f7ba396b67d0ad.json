First, the dangers of the fear response itself were highlighted as a threat to the integrity and continuity of quality care. Second, healthcare workers' fears were compounded by a demonstrable lack of societal and personal protections for infection prevention and control in communities and healthcare facilities, as evidenced by an ongoing cholera epidemic affecting over 20,000 patients in the capital Accra alone since June 2014. Third, a lack of coherent messaging and direction from leadership seems to have limited coordination and reinforced a level of mistrust in the government's ability and commitment to mobilize an adequate response. Initial recommendations include urgent investment in the needed supplies and infrastructure for basic, routine infection control in communities and healthcare facilities, provision of assurances with securities for frontline healthcare workers, establishment of a multi-sector, \"all-hazards\" outbreak surveillance system, and engaging directly with key community groups to co-produce contextually relevant educational messages that will help decrease stigma, fear, and the demoralizing perception that the disease defies remedy or control.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "The EVD epidemic provides an unprecedented opportunity for West African countries not yet affected by EVD cases to make progress on tackling long-standing health systems weaknesses.

In light of the demonstrable lack of personal and societal protections evidenced by the current cholera outbreak, and chronic deficiencies in the space, systems, staff, and stuff to meet routine healthcare needs, the potential to meet added demands for EVD preparation are widely perceived as unrealistic. Healthcare workers at most institutions in Ghana do not receive workers' compensation, disability or life insurance, risk allowances, or supplemental health insurance.

Prioritize strengthening infection prevention and control (IPC) in facilities, including reliable water and electricity. This is an urgent priority for both short and long-term investment. In particular, there should be adequate access to and proper training in the use of PPE for all healthcare workers, and that training should be followed up with structured programs for supervision, monitoring and evaluation. IPC is a critical aspect of EVD prevention, and should be particularly important as a focus for systems strengthening given the endemicity of cholera and tuberculosis in Ghana [6] . Investing in this critical competency is equally essential to build staff confidence and trust in leadership's commitment to quality care and their own occupational health and safety. The risk of an EVD patient escaping detection at triage seems considerable in light of the non-specific nature of symptoms, the experiences in Lagos, Port Harcourt, and Senegal where index patients did not initially disclose their EVD contacts, and the likelihood that -looking to the future -the next outbreak will come unannounced. 2. Provide assurances with securities for frontline healthcare workers. Specifically, healthcare workers should have guaranteed health insurance, workers' compensation and disability insurance should they contract EVD in the process of screening and providing care to patients. Senegal. This education is critical to combat the erroneous perception that EVD defies control, to decrease fear and stigma, and to encourage care-seeking. However, as studies of risk perception suggest, the communication must be bi-directional and contextual to be effective [15] . We need go to the communities and ask what their members understand, what fears they harbor, what practical challenges and concerns they have to implement the key recommendations, and how they think the issues should be addressed. This is the core aim of co-production. Engaging with local religious and community leaders early and often to develop acceptable solutions in context has been a vital component of successful EVD containment strategies in the past [16] [17] [18] .
