For millennia, mice (Mus musculus) were considered to be pests due to their propensity to ravenously consume stored foodstuff (mush in ancient Sanskrit means \"to steal\" [1] ) and their ability to adapt to a wide range of environmental conditions. Since the 1700s, domesticated mice have been bred and kept as companion animals, and in Victorian England, \"fancy\" mice were prized for their variations in coat color and comportment; these mouse strains were the forerunners to the strains used in the laboratory today. Robert Hooke performed the first recorded inquiry-driven experiments on mice in 1664, when he investigated the effects of changes in air pressure on respiratory function [2] . More recently, with data from the Human Genome Project and sequencing of the Mus musculus genome showing remarkable genetic homology between these species, as well as the advent of biotechnology and the development of myriad knockout and transgenic mouse strains, it is clear why the mouse has become the most ubiquitous model organism used to study human disease. In addition, their small size, rapid breeding, and ease of handling are all important advantages to scientists for practical and financial reasons. However, keeping in mind that mice are fellow vertebrates and mammals, there are ethical issues inherent to using these animals in medical research. This chapter will provide an overview of the important similarities and differences between Mus musculus and Homo sapiens and their relevance to the use of the mouse as a model organism and provide specific examples of the quality of mouse models used to investigate the mechanisms, pathology, and treatment of human lung diseases.

Specifically, there is a high degree of similarity in transcription factor networks but a great deal of divergence in the cis-regulatory elements that control gene transcription in the mouse and human genomes. Moreover, the chromatin landscape in cell types of similar lineages in mouse and human is both developmentally stable and evolutionarily conserved [3] .

Thus, the mouse BMR is roughly seven times faster than that of an average-sized human [6] . This higher BMR has effects on thermoregulation, nutrient demand, and nutrient supply. As such, mice have greater amounts of metabolically active tissues (e.g., liver and kidney) and more extensive deposits of brown fat [6] .

Moreover, there are important differences in the blood supply of the large airways in humans versus mice [7] . Specifically, the bronchial circulation (a branch of the high-pressure systemic circulation that arises from the aorta and intercostal arteries) supplies a miniscule proportion of the pulmonary tissue in mice (the trachea and bronchi) compared to humans; the majority of the lung parenchyma is supplied by the low-pressure, high-flow pulmonary circulation. In the mouse, these systemic blood vessels do not penetrate into the intraparenchymal airways, as they do in larger species [8] . This difference, although subtle, has important ramifications regarding the vascular supply of lung tumors which, in humans, is primarily derived from the systemic circulation [9] .

In addition to these differences in immune cell functions, the expression of specific genes involved in immune responses also differs, particularly those for Toll-like receptors, defensins, NK inhibitory receptors, Thy-1, and many components of chemokine and cytokine signaling; additionally, differences between mouse strains are known to exist for many of these mediators [12] . Another important consideration when using mice to perform immunological research (with a view to translating these findings to human medicine) is the availability of hundreds of strains of genetically modified mice that have enabled exquisitely detailed studies on immune cell function, regulation, and trafficking. Many of these strains involve the expression of inducible Cre or Cas9 that allow for targeted knockdown or overexpression of key immune function-related genes in specific cell types at specific moments in time. However, it is important to note that drift between mouse colonies has long been known to occur. In fact, a recent report described the fortuitous discovery of a point mutation in the natural cytotoxicity receptor 1 (NCR1) gene in the C57/Bl6 CD45.1 mouse strain, resulting in absent NCR1 expression. This mutation was found to have profound effects on the response of mice to viral infection, i.e., the mice were resistant to cytomegalovirus infection but more susceptible to influenza virus [23] .

Different strains may be more susceptible to allergic airway inflammation or pulmonary fibrosis, whereas others are more or less resistant. Choosing the right strain to model a specific disease or pathologic event is thus essential. The most widely used strains for models of allergic airway inflammation are BALB/c and C57BL/6. These strains differ regarding the type of immune response mounted to an inhaled allergen: C57BL/6 is generally considered a T H 1-skewed strain, whereas BALB/c is regarded as a T H 2-skewed strain [36] . Due to their strong T H 2response, and subsequent development of robust asthmatic responses, BALB/c has been commonly used to model asthma [37] . However, most humans do not express such a strongly T H 2-skewed immune system, suggesting this strain may not be the best model of human disease; instead, C57BL/6 may be more suitable as immune responses in this strain are more similar to those of atopic human subjects [37] .

Ideally, these features should be found in a physiologically relevant mouse model of asthma. However, for the sake of cost and convenience, early mouse models of asthma used the surrogate protein ovalbumin (OVA) [31] rather than an environmental allergen to induce an immune response, which also requires the use of a powerful T H 2-polarizing adjuvant such as alum delivered via the intraperitoneal route, followed by OVA nebulization-a clear divergence from the etiology of human asthma [36] . In terms of disease presentation, mice develop some hallmarks of asthma, including airway eosinophilic inflammation, goblet cell metaplasia, and increased airway smooth muscle density [31] . After the cessation of OVA exposure, most of the remodeling resolves, although some structural alterations remain up to 1 month after the last challenge [39] .

The etiology of COPD is highly complex and is believed to develop after many years of smoking in combination with other known factors such as genetic susceptibility or environmental factors [51] . In similarity to asthma, inflammation is a major component in COPD, but the leukocyte profile is very different: the most prominent players in COPD-related inflammation are neutrophils and, to some degree, macrophages [51] . Due to the complex etiology of COPD, it is difficult to recapitulate all aspects of this disease in a single model, so in most cases, the aim is to induce COPD-like lesions by exposing mice to tissue-damaging substances (usually cigarette smoke) or to mimic emphysema by the administration of tissue-degrading enzymes [27, 51] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 542, "end": 546, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 739, "end": 743, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 964, "end": 968, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1289, "end": 1293, "text": "[27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1294, "end": 1297, "text": "51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease"}, {"text": "Clearly, mice do not smoke cigarettes on their own, so to model COPD by cigarette smoke (CS) inhalation, the mice need to be exposed to unfiltered CS in an induction chamber; moreover, in an attempt to better model the chronic aspects of COPD, this needs to be performed for a prolonged period of time. Mice are very tolerant to CS, but eventually (over a period of several weeks), CS induces pulmonary neutrophilic inflammation that is associated with some degree of tissue degradation and destruction [51] . An important advantage of this model is the fact that CS is the actual irritant responsible for disease in humans, and mice develop several features similar to the clinical disease, making this model highly clinically relevant [27] . A significant drawback is the self-limitation of the model-the pathological changes do not progress after the cessation of CS exposure [51] . Furthermore, the exposure time needed for mice to develop COPD-like pathology is extensive, i.e., studies have shown that an exposure protocol of 5 days per week for a minimum of 3 months is needed to generate robust structural changes to the lung [52]. The pathological image in COPD is complex and varies greatly between patients, commonly encompassing chronic bronchitis and bronchiolitis, emphysema, fibrosis, and airway obstruction.

Furthermore, as it is used throughout the world, studies performed in different labs and by different groups can be compared relatively easily. Unfortunately, the intense pulmonary inflammation may be lethal, and fatalities are to be expected with this model [59] , representing an important ethical limitation. Furthermore, fibrosis is heterogeneous-it develops where the bleomycin solution is deposited. The solution usually deposits within the central lung, a localization that is not in agreement with the clinical situation where fibrosis is located in the more distal regions of the lung parenchyma. In addition, the fibrosis that develops as a result of severe tissue damage is self-limiting and reversible, unlike what is observed clinically [58] .

Irrespective of the route of delivery, systemic administration results in more homogenous fibrosis, affecting the entire lung through the pulmonary endothelium and persisting much longer than following local administration [61] . The main advantages of systemic administration are that inflammation is limited, while the fibrosis is more apparent and displays a more distal pattern, all of which mimics the clinical situation relatively well. The multiple administrations allow for lower doses with each injection; this is less stressful to the animals and results in little to no mortality [61] and is thus more ethically acceptable.

Of course, the financial aspects of conducting this type of work are an important limitation, as the costs of purchasing and housing mice can be prohibitive, especially when genetically modified mice and colony maintenance are required for the study. The practicalities of working with animals such as mice may also be an issue, as this type of work requires specialized facilities, equipment, and staff to ensure studies are carried out in a manner that is safe for both the researchers and the animals. Moreover, as discussed in detail in this chapter, the relevance of the selected animal model to human disease must be carefully evaluated to ensure that these experiments provide robust results that are translatable to human health and disease.

However, no responsible scientist wants to cause unnecessary suffering in experimental animals if it can be avoided, so scientists have accepted controls on the use of animals for medical research. In the UK, this ethical framework has been enshrined in law, i.e., the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. This legislation requires that applications for a project license to perform research involving the use of \"protected\" animals (including all vertebrates and cephalopods) must be fully assessed with regard to any harm imposed on the animals. This involves a detailed examination of the proposed procedures and experiments, and the numbers and types of animal used, with robust statistical calculations to support these numbers. The planned studies are then considered in light of the potential benefits of the project. Both within and outside the UK, approval for a study involving protected animals also requires an internal ethical review process, usually conducted by the research institution where the work is taking place, with the aim of promoting animal welfare by ensuring the work will be carried out in an ethical manner and that the use of animals is justified. Additionally, the UK has a national animal use reduction strategy supported by the National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs; London, UK).

For example, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is an excellent model organism for studies on genetic diseases, aging, and pathogen-borne illnesses but may be less relevant for studies on complex lung diseases. Importantly, model organisms such as fruit flies, zebrafish, and flatworms do not possess lungs, which somewhat limits the translatability of research on these animals in the field of respiratory disease. As such, it is likely that rodents will remain the model organism of choice for studies into lung disease for some time to come. There has been considerable progress recently in imitating single organs such as the liver, lung, and brain in vitro using multiple cell types and a physical scaffold. As an important advantage, these in vitro tests have replaced a large number of rodents in initial drug discovery experiments, while also speeding up the process [64] .

This standard of animal care is achieved through strict regulations and controls on how personnel are trained to carry out experiments on live animals. Adequate training is an important aspect of refinement and should be reviewed and improved on an ongoing basis. Moreover, refinement can be achieved by improving animal housing by environmental enrichment, e.g., providing a place for mice to hide in the cage and housing social animals such as mice in appropriate-sized groups.
