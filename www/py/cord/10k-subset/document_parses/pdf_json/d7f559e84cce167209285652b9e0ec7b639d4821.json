Proteomics has increasingly drawn attention from simply identifying novel genes to determining the functions of the proteins that they encode. Similar to genome research, studying the characteristics of protein-protein interactions requires the ability to perform massively parallel analyses (Yu et al., 2006) . Microarray technology is a promising method to provide an effective solution for simultaneous detection of various analytes in a single experiment (Bally et al., 2006) . Microarrays are built by assembling a set of ligands onto a solid surface and are suitable for high-throughput analyses. Compared to traditional immunological methods, protein microarrays have several distinct advantages (Rich and Myszka, 2007; Klenkar and Liedberg, 2008) , including low consumption of both the ligand and analyte, parallel screening of multiple interactions, and rapid response readout. Based on diverse detection technologies, protein micro-arrays can form the basis of various types of biosensors as the ideal analytical tools for proteomics (Templin et al., 2003) .",

Commonly used labels include fluorescent dyes (Ligler et al., 2003) , enzymes (Engvall and Perlmann, 1971) , radioactive labels (Aicher et al., 2003) , and the more recently developed quantum dot (Chan and Nie, 1998) . They provide ultra-high throughput readout of protein-protein interactions with good detection sensitivity, specificity, and reliability. Many of the commercially available protein microarray biosensors are labeled (Bally et al., 2006; Boozer et al., 2006) . However, such arrays have several drawbacks (Kodadek, 2001) . First, labeling may change protein conformations and impair bioactivity. This can be especially severe for low molecular weight proteins and peptides with only a few epitopes. Second, labeling may result in difficulties in quantification. In addition, the labeling process is normally time and labor intensive. To solve these problems, substantial effort has been devoted to the development of label-free protein biosensors, though their detection sensitivity for certain biomolecules is lower than that of labeled biosensors (Anastasiadou et al., 2008) .",

By replacing photonic detectors with CCD cameras, SPR imaging (SPRi) improves the throughput of conventional SPR to analyze multiple interactions in parallel. SPRi offers the possibility to simultaneously monitor hundreds of biological interactions and estimate the kinetic parameters of the interactions between the ligands immobilized on the biosensor surface and analytes in solution (Scarano et al., 2010; Kodoyianni, 2011) . Thus far, SPRi has been used for a wide range of biological applications (Campbell and Kim, 2007) , varying from hybridization reactions with DNA to protein-protein interactions. However, to date, little has been done to apply SPRi in commercial practices, such as clinical diagnostics, food analysis, and pharmaceutical research (Kodoyianni, 2011) . Ellipsometry is a conventional optical technique for measuring changes in light polarization states, and it can determine film thickness with a resolution of \u2264 0.01 nm as a nondestructive and label-free method (Arwin, 1998) . Imaging ellipsometry is an enhancement of standard single beam ellipsometry that combines the power of ellipsometry with microscopy (Jin, 2008) . A high spatial resolution, on the order of micrometers (laterally) and sub-nanometers (vertically), can be achieved with a large viewable area (several square centimeters), which allows simultaneous multi-sensing of target microarrays.",

In BTIRIE systems, imaging ellipsometry is performed in the total internal reflection mode, and the change of the evanescent wave field near the sensing surface is used to describe the biomolecular interactions. BTIRIE offers a much higher sensitivity because of its phase-sensitive property . Theoretically, BTIRIEs are 30 times more sensitive than the conventional SPR method (Asinovski et al., 2008) after optimization, including polarization setting, the spectroscopic technique, and the use of a cooled imaging device to improve the signal-noise ratio and detection limit (Liu et al., 2010 .",

The microarray reactor serves to fabricate the protein microarray and accommodate biomolecular interactions. Using the micro-fluidic reactor, various ligands are delivered to different cells to form a sensing array, and each sensing surface can be prepared homogeneously under the flow condition. The imaging ellipsometer acts as a reader for data acquisition from the microarray. Imaging ellipsometry is an enhancement of standard ellipsometry, which combines the power of ellipsometry with microscopy (Jin et al., 1995 (Jin et al., , 1996 . The latest imaging ellipsometer is a spectroscopic imaging ellipsometry (SIE) system . Compared to single-beam imaging ellipsometers, SIEs have advantages in achieving the thickness distribution on a solid substrate with optical lateral resolution on the order of microns upon magnification . SIEs can be used to visualize ultra-thin films and the concentration change of a molecular mass surface (Jin et al., 1995 (Jin et al., , 1996 . Slight variations of thickness can be remarkably distinguished by imaging ellipsometry, and the results are represented as grayscale images (Jin, 2008) . The grayscale value is approximately linearly proportional to the thickness of the molecular film (Chen et al., 2007a ). The control system is responsible for combining the microarray reactor with the imaging ellipsometer and functions to control the hardware's mechanical motion and obtain results in images. Indeed, the control system is the central piece of an automated biosensor. The biosensor database is used to aid BIE users in determining optimized experimental conditions by comparing previously stored data to current requirements.",

A ligand and its receptor (e.g., an antibody and its corresponding antigen, respectively) can assemble into bio-complexes due to their affinity. The optical biosensor is based on the fact that each reactant, such as a ligand, is immobilized to a surface to form a monolayer, acting as a bioprobe via its bioactivity. The other reactant, such as the analyte (or receptor), exists in a solution. The bioprobe is then exposed to the solution containing the analyte. When the analyte in the solution interacts with its corresponding ligand, they assemble into a complex based upon their inherent binding affinity. The molecular mass surface concentration where the interaction takes place becomes higher than before exposure to the analyte solution. A significant increase of the surface concentration indicates that the solution contains the receptor bound to the ligand. With the visualization of imaging ellipsometry, which has high vertical and lateral spatial resolution (on the order of 0.1 nm and 1 \u03bcm, respectively), the increase in surface concentration can be determined, and in this way, the existence of the analyte in the solution is verified. Many bioprobes can be arranged in a matrix to form a protein microarray for multi-detection (Jin and Wang, 2002; Wang and Jin, 2003b) .",

Ricin, whose estimated oral lethal dose is < 20 mg/kg body weight in humans, is one of the most potent plant toxins known. Antibodies against ricin can identify and neutralize the toxin quickly and efficiently and are thus of great significance for the diagnosis and treatment of patients exposed to ricin poison. All five antibodies react with 50 \u03bcg/mL ricin but not abrin, a ricin analog (Fig. 3A) . When the ricin concentration was decreased to 1 ng/mL, the limit of detection (LOD) values of 7G7, pVHHS1, 5S1R, VHHS1, and S1R are 5 ng/mL, 500 ng/mL, 1 ng/mL, 1 \u03bcg/mL, and 10 ng/mL, respectively (Fig. 3B) , which essentially agrees with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results.

BIEs have been applied in this field and demonstrated some success. Niu et al. (2008) developed a BIE protocol for quantitative measurement of CD146 for tumor marker detection. The CD146 glycoprotein, which may be involved in tumor angiogenesis in endothelial cells, was originally identified as a tumor marker for melanoma. First, CD146 antibody was immobilized by absorption to a protein G-modified silicon substrate. Then, a calibration curve was established for quantitative CD146 detection, and the relationship between the BIE signal y (grayscale value) and the CD146 concentration x (ng/mL) was established (y = 3.3ln(x) + 91.3, as shown in Fig. 4) . Finally, 18 serum samples were analyzed to quantify their CD146 concentrations, with detection sensitivity on the order of ng/mL. The majority of these results significantly statistically agree with those of ELISA measurements (Fig. 4C) . Qi et al. (2009b) analyzed 169 patient serum samples by BIE for clinical diagnosis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Five markers of HBV, including hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb), and hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), are generally used as clinical markers to detect HBV infection. BIE simultaneously detects five markers in eight samples in the same microarray in only 1 h, whereas ELISA can only detect one marker on each plate over a longer time (ligand immobilization and assaying lasts 1-2 days). Moreover, the BIE results are in good agreement with the ELISA results. Sensitivities of 1 ng/mL and 1 IU/mL for HBsAg and HBsAb detection, respectively, have been achieved. The cutoffs (CoVs, i.e., the percentage over the values of the corresponding to negative control produced by national reference negative samples) derived from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of the five markers (HBsAg, HBsAb, HBeAg, HBeAb, and HBcAb) were deduced to be 15%, 18%, 15%, 20%, and 15%, respectively. Anastasiadou et al. (2008) evaluated the potential of polarimetric imaging for the early detection and therapy of cervical cancer. The current strategy for cervical cancer detection and therapy is based on detailed examination via a colposcopy. Although being well established, a colposcopy is a very difficult and operator-dependent method, which may lead to a significant proportion of false diagnoses. To develop an additional clinical method, the authors performed the simple linear degree of polarization technique on cone biopsy specimens and found some preliminary but quite encouraging results. A clinical trial of this device is ongoing to compare this imaging modality with classical colposcopy for visualizing cervical precancerous or cancerous lesions.",

The calibration curves of AFP, AFU and ferritin are y = 13.4 lg(x) + 79.7 (detection range from 1 to 64 ng/mL), y = 24.6 lg(x) + 88.1 (detection range from 1 to 64 U/L), and y = 14.5 lg(x) + 76.8 (detection range from 5 to 160 ng/mL), respectively. Here, y is the BIE signal (in grayscale value) and x is the marker concentration (in ng/mL or U/L). The concentrations of AFP, AFU, and ferritin in 56 serum samples composed of 32 normal and 24 liver cancer patients were measured (shown in Fig. 5A ), and the results were compared to those obtained by routine clinical approaches, such as enhanced chemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) for AFP, ELISA for AFU, and immunoturbidimetry for ferritin. The Pearson's correlation coefficients of the comparisons are 0.532, 0.948, and 0.937 for AFP, AFU, and ferritin, respectively, which indicates that the results obtained by BIE and routine approaches are significantly statistically similar. ROC curves for single marker detection and logistic regression for joint marker tests were introduced to evaluate BIE's performance in the diagnosis of liver cancer. The area under the curve (AUC), which provides the relationship between the sensitivity and specificity for an independent test, is 0.827, 0.782, and 0.380 for AFP, AFU, and ferritin, respectively (shown in Fig. 5B ). However, the AUC increases to 0.884 for joint detection of AFP and AFU, while ferritin is much less related to these two markers. This indicates that the joint detection of tumor markers AFP and AFU may be more useful than their individual detection for clinical liver cancer diagnosis.",

Although at the lowest concentration of 0.1 ng/mL, the BTIRIE signal is still significantly higher than the reference. This implies that the detection sensitivity of BTIRIE reaches the order of 0.1 ng/mL, which is > 10 times more sensitive than BIE. Mustafa et al. (2010) exploited spectroscopic BTIRE as a highly sensitive method to detect \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2-16).

After passing the polarizer and compensator, the polarized collimated beam propagated perpendicularly to the prism and onto the sensing surface. The gold sensing surface was immobilized with ligand for biomolecule interaction in the contacting micro-fluidic reactor array. When the incident angle was larger than the critical angle, the evanescent wave appeared sharply at the sensing surface to detect biomolecule interaction in very shallow depth from the surface.

            "text": "Vesicle absorption is used to study cell membrane properties due to their similar lipid bilayer structures. Liu et al. applied BTIRIE to visualize the non-specific absorption and release process of vesicles (made of 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) from a poly-L-lysine-modified gold surface (Fig. 11; Jin et al., 2011) . Region 6 of curves \"a\" and \"b\" in Fig. 11 corresponds to the non-specific absorption of vesicles onto the poly-L-lysine surface. In region 7, the glucose solution was changed at a 5 \u03bcL/min flux. The corresponding signal decrease indicates vesicles being rinsed off by the glucose solution. When the flux increased to 10 \u03bcL/min (region 8), the signal remained nearly the same because the flux was not large enough to remove more vesicles. By increasing the flux to 30 \u03bcL/min (region 9), the signal in curves \"a\" and \"b\" further decreased but remained constant in reference curve \"c\". These results demonstrate that vesicles were removed from the surface by the shear-force of the glucose flux, by destroying the non-specific adsorption between vesicles and poly-L-lysine. By increasing the flux to 40 \u03bcL/min, the signal in curves \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" decreased simultaneously, indicating that the poly-L-lysine was also removed from the surface. These results were verified in a parallel experiment performed with a phase contrast microscope (NIKON, TI-U, Japan), indicating that the process of vesicle absorption, release, and poly-L-lysine layer destruction on the surface can be visualized by BTIRIE.",

The successful experiments described above prove that these techniques are suitable tools for biomedical and clinical applications. Aside from having the same advantages of being label-free, non-contact, and ultra-highly sensitive, BTIRIE excels over BIE by avoiding errors in the ex situ mode. Having high potential to monitor weak and transient biological interactions in real-time, which is very difficult for traditional approaches, BTIRIE has become a powerful technique for biomolecular detection as well as in clinical diagnosis. noassay; HBV, hepatitis B virus; LOD, limit of detection; SIE, spectroscopic imaging ellipsometry; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; SPRi, SPR imaging",
