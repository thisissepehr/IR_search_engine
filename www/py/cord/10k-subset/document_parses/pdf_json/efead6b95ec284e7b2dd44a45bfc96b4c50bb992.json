            "text": "The efficacy of penicillin G was evaluated in the prevention of infections caused by streptococci in patients receiving remission induction or intensive consolidation treatment for acute myeloid leukaemia. Between 1980 and 1988, 29 episodes of streptococcal septicaemia occurred in 139 treatment events. All patients received as prophylaxis regimen ciprofloxacin (n = 38) or a combination of polymyxin B with nalidixic acid (n = 42) or neomycin (n = 59). Six patients died of streptococcal septicaemia despite adequate antibiotic treatment. The high incidence of streptococcal septicaemia lead to the administration of penicillin G in addition to ciprofloxacin as prophylaxis regimen during the 14 days immediately following cytotoxic chemotherapy. Only two episodes of streptococcal septicaemia were documented after addition of penicillin G to the prophylaxis regimen (n = 76, p < 0.001). Both patients had an uneventful recovery after treatment with vancomycin. Patients receiving penicillin G prophylaxis experienced fever during 17 % of the time and received antimicrobial therapy during 20 % of the time per treatment event compared with 27 % and 32 % respectively of this time in patients receiving no streptococcal prophylaxis (p < 0.001). Penicillin G prophylaxis was associated with an increased incidence of fever of unknown origin and more frequent isolation of aerobic gram-negative bacteria in surveillance cultures. Penicillin G in combination with ciprofloxacin proved to be highly successful in preventing infections caused by streptococci and in reducing infection-related mortality and morbidity.",

Although gramnegative bacteria used to be the predominant pathogens causing infection, streptococci are now a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. Complications of streptococcal septicaemia include respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock (5) (6) (7) . Mortality rates vary between 10 % and 38 % (1, 8) . The change in the pathogen spectrum of bacterial infections and the severity of these infections have lead to revision of the strategies for management of neutropenic patients, Since currently used prophylactic regimens do not prevent streptococcal septicaemia, additional administration of vancomycin (9, 10) , roxithromycin (11) penicillin (12) has been suggested. Other investigators recommend the routine empirical use of vancomycin (13) or penicillin G (8) upon onset of fever. Heimdahl et al. (14) recommend limiting the portals of entry for streptococci by preventing oral herpes simplex virus infections.",

An increased incidence of infections caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis is as-Eur. J. Clin. Microbioh Infect. Dis. sociated with the more frequent use of indwelling central venous catheters (15, 16) . The increasing incidence of streptococcal septicaemia in patients with leukaemia coincides with the use of more aggressive cytotoxic chemotherapy causing more severe and prolonged neutropenia and a greater degree of mucositis, thereby providing portals of entry for these organisms (1, 2, 14) . Furthermore, the institution of selective intestinal decontamination (4), especially with the newer quinolones (6, 10) may play a role.",

Only two episodes of septicaemia caused by streptococci were documented after penicillin G was added to the prophylactic regimen (76 treatment events). One case involved the isolation of an erythromycin sensitive streptococcus in a patient who received erythromycin as alternative streptococcal prophylaxis because of allergy to penicillin. Apparently, because erythromycin is bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal, it could not prevent septicaemia. The second case occurred one day after discontinuation of prophylaxis in a still severely neutropenic patient. Both patients recovered uneventfully after antibiotic treatment with vancomycin. Streptococcal septicaemia was documented in 8 of 38 treatment events in patients receiving ciprofloxacin alone (p < 0.01), and in 21 of 101 treatment events in patients receiving polymyxin B plus nalidixic acid or neomycin (p < 0.001), with a fatal outcome in four and two cases respectively. Guiot et al. (12) also reported a decreased incidence of streptococcal infection after the introduction of penicillin G for prophylaxis. In another study, Guiot et al. (17) demonstrated that infections with viridans streptococci occurred less frequently and were less severe in patients on penicillin G prophylaxis compared with patients on cotrimoxazole prophylaxis.",
