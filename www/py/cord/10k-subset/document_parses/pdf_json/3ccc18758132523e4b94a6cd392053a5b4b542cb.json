This sequence also was always near the crossover sites in the recombinant RNA 3s observed here, and the 19-nt imperfect repeat also comes from this sequence. Therefore, we examined the requirement for this sequence in infection. Three deletion mutants were constructed: C1 \u00c123 , C2 T2B\u00c123 and T3 \u00c1163(A)\u00c123 , where the conserved 23-nt sequence was deleted from each of C1, C2 T2B and T3 \u00c1163(A) , respectively.

Since the pseudorecombinant viruses containing the 23-nt sequence were viable without detectable recombination for some time (Figure 2) , these results indicate that the 23-nt sequence is not essential for replication of the pseudorecombinant virus, but may be essential for maintaining infection of the pseudorecombinant viruses through the plants, just as the 2b protein was required for this task, but not for the maintenance of infection of the parental viruses (19, 21) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 213, "end": 217, "text": "(33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 218, "end": 221, "text": "38)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1724, "end": 1728, "text": "(19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1729, "end": 1732, "text": "21)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 959, "end": 968, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 1103, "end": 1112, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 1383, "end": 1393, "text": "(Figure 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Recombinant RNA 3s involve no detectable intermediates and are precisely generated"}, {"text": "The above results showed that the CMV sequence in the recombinant RNA 3 was similar or identical to the CMV RNA 5 sequence.

To determine whether CMV RNA 5 itself or the 3 0 NTR of CMV RNAs 1 and/or 2 could be used as a template for the synthesis of the recombinant RNA 3, we prepared the appropriate templates that would be expressed transiently in inoculated plants and assessed these for the presence of recombinant virus. In the templates, we deleted 326 nt from the 3 0 NTR of T3 to make T3 , and deleted the first 163-nt repeat plus 141 nt from the 3 0 NTR of T3 to make T3 \u00c1163(A)\u00c1141 (Figure 1 ). These two deletions had the same length of the TAV RNA 3 sequence as in the recombinant RNAs. In addition, we also made four RNA 5-like cDNA clones, C1 3081-3390 , C2 W2B2757-3065 , T3 1902-2386 and T3 2065-2386 . The former two were based on the CMV RNA 1 and C2 W2B sequences in the recombinant viruses, respectively, while the latter two were based on the sequence of TAV RNAs 3B and 5, respectively (39) . All of these clones were placed into the pCass1 vector, under transcriptional control of the CaMV 35S RNA promoter and terminator sequences. The infectivity results of the various plasmid mixtures tested on N. glutinosa and N. clevelandii plants are shown in Table 1 (Table 1 ). These results indicate that the sequences containing the 3 0 NTR are essential for the viral infection and could not be separated functionally from the rest of the TAV RNA 3 sequence. In addition, the results also indicate that the recombination observed in other experiments did not occur during the synthesis of (\u00c0) sense RNA from (+) sense templates, since there was no repair of the 3 0 NTR from synthesis initiated on either genomic RNAs 1 or 2, or subgenomic RNAs 3B or 5 (Table 1) and template switching to TAV RNA 3 lacking the 3 0 NTR. Such repair recombination is common among tombusviruses (8, 53) and occurs with the related brome mosaic virus (54) (55) (56) . Therefore, an alternative explanation is that the recombination occurred during (+) sense RNA synthesis on the (\u00c0) sense RNA templates, with recombination occurring as a result of template switching of the viral replicase from the donor (TAV RNA 3) strand to the acceptor (CMV RNA) strand.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1194, "end": 1198, "text": "(39)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2081, "end": 2084, "text": "(8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2085, "end": 2088, "text": "53)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 2136, "end": 2140, "text": "(54)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 2141, "end": 2145, "text": "(55)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2146, "end": 2150, "text": "(56)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 778, "end": 787, "text": "(Figure 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1460, "end": 1467, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 1468, "end": 1476, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 1958, "end": 1967, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Recombinant RNA 3s involve no detectable intermediates and are precisely generated"}, {"text": "Based on putative secondary structures for the 3 0 NTRs of CMV and TAV, models have been proposed to account for the generation of some of the other recombination products previously observed to occur between CMV and TAV (33, 38) .

The nature of the plasmid constructs is described in Figure 1 . recombination. Therefore, generation of TAV RNA 3 progeny with deletion of one of the 163-nt repeats is more likely to occur than recombination between TAV RNA 3 and another viral genomic RNA. That is, if one repeat is missing, then only intermolecular recombination can occur, which may explain why the recombinants were seen to accumulate more rapidly in the plants directly inoculated with virus containing only one repeat ( Figure 2 ). On the other hand, loss of a repeat was not a prerequisite for intermolecular recombination, since intramolecular recombination would involve loss of the first repeat [163(A)], while the recombinants formed from the full-length T3 all retained the first repeat. Intramolecular recombination would be expected to occur during (+) TAV RNA 3 synthesis, if the polymerase jumped from the beginning of the first repeat in stem-loop L2 ( Figure 7A ) to the beginning of the second repeat in stemloop L1 ( Figure 7B ). These sequences also contain the putative RNA 5 subgenomic promoter sequence (33, 38) that would facilitate this recombination and those described previously that involved this 'hot spot' for intermolecular recombination between TAV and CMV (33, 38) . The presence of another stem-loop structure (K1/K2 in Figure 7 ) immediately adjacent to the putative subgenomic promoter may slow the polymerase down sufficiently to stutter and in some cases switch templates. In the case of the first TAV-CMV RNA 3 recombinant described (30) , this occurred just before another stem-loop structure in the first repeat (J2 in Figure 7A ; see arrow), but in that instance, the polymerase jumped to the putative RNA 5 subgenomic promoter of (\u00c0) CMV RNA 2, leading to an initial recombinant that had a duplication of the two, putative subgenomic RNA promoters, which then led to a second recombination event, with the intervening TAV RNA 3 sequences deleted, giving the final, stable recombinant RNA 3 described (30) . The full-length TAV RNA 3, as well as the T3 \u00c1163(G) variant gave rise to similar recombination products, with the exact switchover position on the donor RNA of the recombinant determined by the 2b gene present (T2B versus W2B), while the switchover position on the receptor RNA is the beginning of the RNA 5 sequence in either CMV RNAs 1 or 2, again determined by the specific 2b gene present. In the case of C1C2 T2B T3 and C1C2 T2B T3 \u00c1163(G) , the recombination occurred immediately after nucleotide 2060. For C1C2 T2B T3, switchover would have had to occur at the base of stem-loop L1 ( Figure 7B ), while for C1C2 T2B T3 \u00c1163(G) , switchover would have had to occur within stem-loop G ( Figure 7B and C), since the sequences comprising stem-loop L1 (plus stem-loops K1 to H1) would not exist in C1C2 T2B T3 \u00c1163(G) . Since stem-loops L1 and G are quite different in most of their sequence and structure, as well as stability (\u00c1G = -1.3 kcal/mol for stem-loop G and \u00c06.9 kcal/mol for stem-loop L1), it seems likely that the common structures preceding these stem-loops (J2-I2-H2 versus J1-I1-H1; \u00c1G = \u00c03.8, \u00c04.8 and \u00c02.9 kcal/mol, for each stem-loop structure) may have slowed the polymerase sufficiently to allow it to pause at nucleotide 2060, in either stem-loop L1 or G ( Figure 7B ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 98, "end": 117, "text": "1-2060 T3 1902-2386", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1310, "end": 1314, "text": "(33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1315, "end": 1318, "text": "38)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1474, "end": 1478, "text": "(33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1479, "end": 1482, "text": "38)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1757, "end": 1761, "text": "(30)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2228, "end": 2232, "text": "(30)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 270, "end": 278, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 709, "end": 717, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1153, "end": 1162, "text": "Figure 7A", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}, {"start": 1220, "end": 1229, "text": "Figure 7B", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}, {"start": 1539, "end": 1547, "text": "Figure 7", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}, {"start": 1845, "end": 1854, "text": "Figure 7A", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}, {"start": 2827, "end": 2836, "text": "Figure 7B", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}, {"start": 2928, "end": 2937, "text": "Figure 7B", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}, {"start": 3516, "end": 3525, "text": "Figure 7B", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}], "section": "A model for the generation of the various recombination products"}, {"text": "In the case of C1C2W 2B T3 \u00c1163(G) , switchover occurred following nucleotide 2064 in stem-loop G, but did not immediately proceed to the (\u00c0) CMV RNA 2 as the receptor RNA. Rather, the polymerase jumped back to the subgenomic promoter stem-loop (L2) and copied this through the A residue in the gap between stem-loops L2 and K2 ( Figure 7A) , before pausing and jumping to the same subgenomic promoter sequence on (\u00c0) CMV RNA 2. The small difference in \u00c1G between the 6 bp stem-loop K2 in (\u00c0) TAV RNA 3 (\u00c1G = \u00c02.7 kcal/mol) and a weaker 3 bp stem-loop (K 0 ) structure adjacent to the subgenomic promoter in (\u00c0) CMV RNA 2 (\u00c1G = \u00c02.1 kcal/mol) may be sufficient to prevent the polymerase from pausing at the base of stem-loop K 0 in (\u00c0) CMV RNA 2. This explains the duplication of the 19 nt seen in Figure 5D , following the A residue (from copying the first nucleotide, U-1902 of the RNA 5/3B promoter). In the case of C1C2 W2B T3, the same recombinant progeny RNA 3 is seen, but it must have been generated from a different starting point, since the second repeat is present in the template but missing in the recombinant progeny RNA 3. Here, template switching occurred either immediately after nucleotide 2084 (the A residue in the gap between stem-loops L1 and K1), again leading to a partially duplicated subgenomic promoter with the 19 nt repeat, or it occurred at nucleotide 2064, in the lower region of stem-loop L1 ( Figure 7B ), and then proceeded as described above for C1C2 W2B T3 \u00c1163(G) .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 330, "end": 340, "text": "Figure 7A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}, {"start": 798, "end": 807, "text": "Figure 5D", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 1426, "end": 1435, "text": "Figure 7B", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}], "section": "A model for the generation of the various recombination products"}, {"text": "In contrast to C1C2 T2B T3 \u00c1163(G) , C1C2 T2B T3 \u00c1163(A) and C1C2W 2B T3 \u00c1163(A) underwent recombination 22 nt further along the TAV RNA 3 molecule after nucleotide 2245, adjacent to stem-loop E (in Figure 7C) , regardless of the nature of the 2b protein. Therefore, while the nature of the receptor RNA and the apparently slow selection of the recombinants (Figures 2 and 6) were determined by the 2b gene, the generation of recombinants at position 2245 was determined by the absence of the first repeat. Since the first and second repeats differ by only one nucleotide (underlined blue letters in Figure 7A and B, at positions 1966 and 2129), we propose that there must be a difference in structure between the virus containing only one repeat, when this is the second repeat versus the first repeat, and that this difference in structure affects pausing by the polymerase, leading to switchover to another template. This difference could be the presence (or absence) of a weak pseudoknot structure formed between the three A residues in the loop of stem-loop G and the three U residues in the non-base-paired region between stem-loops K2 and J2 (see blue letters in Figures 7) . This pseudoknot would not be stable in T3 \u00c1163(A) , since it would only contain two A:U base pairs. This weak pseudoknot structure may be sufficient to affect pausing by the polymerase in the T3 \u00c1163(G) variant, if it can re-form after the polymerase has gone through it the first time and then transcribed through the various, following stem-loop structures (stem-loops J, I and H in Figure 7 ), leading to template switching in stem-loop G.

However, based on the spatial separation of the 2b protein from the replication machinery within the cell (49) (50) (51) , it is difficult to envision how different 2b proteins provide the selection observed through their RNA silencing suppressor functions. In the case of the tombusvirus cucumber necrosis virus, inhibition of expression of the 20-kDa protein now known to be the RNA silencing suppressor of this virus, led to the rapid appearance of defective-interfering RNAs (59) . Thus, in that, the absence of the silencing suppressor led to enhanced generation or selection of recombinant RNAs, while in the case of CMV, the source of the 2b protein determined the nature of the recombinant RNAs selected and pseudorecombinant viruses could not be selected in its absence (21) . Moreover, in the case of influenza virus, where the NS1 gene encodes an RNA silencing suppressor (60) , mutation in a different gene (NS2) led to the rapid appearance of defective interfering particles (61) .
