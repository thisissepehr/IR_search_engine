Young age and comorbidities, such as obesity, diabetes, chronic heart failure, pregnancy, as well as the late administration of oseltamivir (>48 h after onset of fi rst fl u symptoms) have been described to be associated with the risk of becoming critically ill [1] [2] [3] [4] .

A matching process was not performed as we aimed at comparing an average patient population representative for the respective intensive care units to the very particular cohort of patients with H1N1v. Th us, we chose all adult patients who were consecutively admitted to our ICUs within a period of 6 months around the peak of H1N1v-associated ICU admissions as control group. Cumulative TISS 28 scores, as well as median TISS 28 scores per patient per day were higher in patients with H1N1v compared to control group patients. Th is particular score can be used to objectify the amount of work load per patient in terms of diagnostic and therapeutic measures, and, furthermore, correlates with patient-specifi c costs [22] . One has to keep in mind that the TISS 28 score does not account for extracorporeal gas exchange therapies, so that eff ort and costs were, in fact, even underestimated in patients with H1N1v.",

However, only cases admitted to intensive care units were registered centrally in our hospital, whereas all other admitted cases were reported directly to the respective health authority. In Austria, 1569 patients with proven infl uenza A H1N1v infection were admitted to a hospital during phase 6 of pandemic. More than half of them were younger than 19 years [23] . Recording of outpatients was not required from November 2009 on. Unfortunately, it is not possible to extract data on specifi c hospitals from this registry. Since the majority of our patients (11 out of 17; 65%) were referred from other hospitals, the number of ICU patients does not refl ect a proportion of patients with H1N1v treated in our hospital. However, the intent of this report was to study the clinical courses of critically ill patients with infl uenza A H1N1v and to describe the associated burden for the eff ected intensive care units as part of an ECMO referral center.",

Der Body Mass Index war 26 (24-35); 24 % waren \u00fcbergewichtig und 29% fettleibig. Der Charlson Comorbidity Index war 1 (0-2) und nur ein Patient hatte keinerlei Vorerkrankungen. Die mediane Zeit zwischen Symptombeginn und ICU Aufnahme betrug 5 Tage (Range 0-14). Keiner der Patienten hatte eine H1N1v Vakzine erhalten. Neun Patienten erhielten Oseltamivir, jedoch lediglich zwei innerhalb der ersten 48 Stunden nach Symptombeginn. Alle Patienten entwickelten ein schweres ARDS (PaO 2 /FiO 2 -Ratio: 60 (55-92); lung injury score: 3.8 (3,3-4,0)), waren maschinell beatmet und ben\u00f6tigten Vasopressoren.
