When such reactions occur minutes to hours after systemic, intravenous product administration, they are often called infusion reactions, hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis. However, there is no uniform terminology, and the use of these terms largely depends on the field of study (clinical oncology versus immunology, for example). The World Allergy Organization classifies hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) as immediate (occurring within minutes to hours of exposure) or delayed (requiring days before clinical manifestation) 2, 3 . According to the World Allergy Organization Anaphylaxis Guideline, the term 'hypersensitivity' refers to reproducible symptoms occurring as the result of exposure to a defined stimulus; 'allergy' is defined as an HSR initiated by a specific immunological mechanism; and 'anaphylaxis' is classified as a severe, life-threatening, generalized or systemic HSR 5 . The European Society for Medical Oncology divides the reactions into anaphylactic and anaphylactoid, and proposes the term 'non-allergic anaphylaxis' instead of 'anaphylactoid' where there is a 'non-immunological cause' 6 . The European Network for Drug Allergy's definition is independent of the underlying immunological mechanism and categorizes the HSRs as immediate and non-immediate. Moreover, differences between European and American physicians exist in managing these reactions 7 . The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events distinguishes between allergy, anaphylaxis and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) based on clinical manifestations 8 . The more commonly known Gell and Coombs classification is based on the underlying immunological mechanism and the time to manifestation, and includes four types: immediate/type I (developing within 15-30 minutes of exposure), type II (minutes to hours) and type III (3-8 hours) ; and delayed/type IV (48-72 hours) 9 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 133, "end": 136, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 137, "end": 140, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 141, "end": 144, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 145, "end": 148, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 675, "end": 677, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1992, "end": 2003, "text": "(3-8 hours)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Although many immune-mediated adverse effects exist, here we focus on IRs.

Despite the difference in underlying mechanisms, IRs may have overlapping clinical manifestations. Patients with acute IRs experience various symptoms including, but not limited to, skin flushing or rash, chest and back pain, dyspnoea, wheezing, chills, fever and rigor (Tables 1 and 2 ). These adverse effects require timely and accurate assessment, and proper management to avoid severe and potentially fatal consequences. Severe IRs are rare and occur in less than 5% of patients 4 . The incidence may increase, however, when different drugs are used in combination (for example paclitaxel and carboplatin), when patients have a certain type of human leukocyte antigens (HLA; for example HLA-B*57:01 and abacavir) or when there is an underlying viral infection (for example Epstein-Barr virus infection and penicillin) 6, 13 . Despite decades of research suggesting that the incidence of IRs depends on both pharmacodynamics and pharmacogenetics, it is largely unknown why some patients develop these reactions while others do not. The lack of uniform terminology and classification of the reactions further complicates the issue. As such, acute IRs cause substantial stress among patients and their families as well as care providers and regulatory agencies 16 . Several world-leading health authorities (the World Health Organization, the United States Food and Drug Administration 17 and the European Medicines Agency) agree on the noxious nature of these adverse effects and the need for improved prevention and management 6 .

The main cellular contributors to this HSR type are mast cells, the activation of which leads to hay fever, allergic asthma and/or anaphylactic shock 9, 13 . Type II HSR is cytotoxic hypersensitivity mediated by drug-specific antibodies (mainly IgG), the complement system and natural killer cells. Symptoms include pemphigus, nephritis, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia and Goodpasture's syndrome 9, 13 . Type III HSRs are mediated by the immune complexes formed between a drug and an antibody (either IgM or IgG), and they involve complement activation. Clinical manifestations are serum sickness, fever, glomerulonephritis and vasculitis 9, 13 . Type IV HSRs are mediated by T-helper cells and macrophages and manifest as erythema, induration, contact dermatitis, maculopapular rash and granuloma 9, 13 . An immediate IgE-independent HSR with symptoms resembling a type I HSR is known as a complement activationrelated pseudo-allergy (CARPA) 18 . Type I-III reactions and CARPA are commonly recognized mechanisms associated with drug-mediated HSRs. Platinumbased formulations are notorious for type I HSRs 4,6 , while CARPA is the best-studied reaction to nanomaterials 18, 19 . CARPA has been described for liposomal drugs (Doxil and Ambisome), micelles (Taxol and Taxotere) and modified dextran-coated iron oxides (Feraheme), all of which are approved for clinical use and are marketed with a black box warning of potentially life-threatening IRs. Properties of nanomaterials commonly associated with CARPA are summarized in Fig. 1a . Uncontrolled release of cytokines resulting from excessive proinflammatory stimuli, inadequate regulation of inflammation or a combination thereof is responsible for severe CRS. The clinical manifestations of CRS include erythematous or pruritic rash, hypotension, fever, malaise, tachycardia, tachypnoea, generalized swelling, altered mental status, diffuse lymphadenopathy, and enlargement of the liver and spleen 20 . CRS created translation barriers for immunotherapies (for example CAR-T cells), biologics (for example TGN1412) and nanotechnology-formulated therapeutic nucleic acids (for example MRX34) 10,21-23 . The consequences were severe and, in some cases, fatal 23 . It is important to mention that in some cases (CAR-T therapy, for example), clinical CRS manifestations are not immediate and may take a week or more, which further complicates IR definition, diagnosis and intervention. Moreover, some infections (such as influenza virus and bacteraemia) may trigger cytokine release with symptoms indistinguishable from the drug-mediated CRS 24 .

For example, activation of the complement system, which occurs in CARPA, is also involved in the pathogenesis of type II and type III HSRs. Conversely, the macrophages may contribute both to type IV HSRs and to CARPA. Cytokines that are produced by leukocytes are involved in CRS and can contribute to various types of HSRs, including pseudoallergy. An excellent demonstration of the complexity of frequently overlapping mechanisms that cause IRs to nanomedicines comes from the experiences with liposomes and lipid-based nanocarriers, which, according to a recent report by the US Food and Drug Administration, dominate the current landscape of nanomedicine 26 .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Mechanisms of IRs in humans"}, {"text": "Research groups worldwide have reported that lipid-based carriers are not immunologically inert 25, 27, 28 .

The proposed double-hit scenario in this mechanism implies that both the complement and macrophage activation trigger the IRs symptoms 29 . Recently, a study of polystyrene beads in the same model concluded that PIMs activation is the leading cause of HSRs to nanomaterials and challenged the role of the complement 30 . This mechanism caused robust debate 31, 32 . On the one hand, there is ample evidence that the pig model is sensitive to the detection of nanomedicine-induced CARPA 32, 33 . On the other hand, PIMs are not present in the lungs of humans and animals commonly used in preclinical research (mice, rats, dogs and non-human primates) [34] [35] [36] . In these animal species, the liver-and spleen-resident macrophages are primarily responsible for nanoparticle clearance. PIMs are induced in humans under certain pathological conditions, such as liver failure 34, 35 . In contrast, PIMs are common in the lungs of pigs, sheep and horses, not broadly recognized as preclinical models 34, 35 . Therefore, one area that requires close attention is the understanding of whether liver-and spleen-resident macrophages in humans play the same role as PIMs in pigs during IRs to nanomedicines. The hypothesis that hepatopulmonary macrophage migration triggers cardiorespiratory symptoms in humans exposed to nanomedicines 37 is attractive but requires verification. The pivotal role of PIMs in nanoparticle-mediated IRs in the porcine model will benefit from confirmation by various research groups and with various types of nanomaterials. For example, a recent study demonstrated that during the infusion reaction triggered in pigs by carboxylated, hydrophobic, highly anionic polystyrene nanoparticles, complement activation-related opsonization coincided with the peak of pulmonary distress 38 . The relative contribution of the complement and PIMs, as well as the cause-effect relationship, may vary between different types of nanoparticles. Therefore, studies with clinically relevant well-characterized nanomedicines (for example liposomes, micelles, iron-oxides) are essential, while research-grade nanomaterials with poorly understood physicochemical properties (such as polystyrene beads) may not provide clinically relevant answers unless these particles are thoroughly characterized. The nature of a condition (cancer versus inflammatory disorder, for example) treated with a nanodrug should also be considered when analysing the mechanism of IRs to the nanomedicine.
