In contrast to the efficacy of comparable dosages of rIFN-U2 [9, 11] , rIFN-f3ser was disappointingly ineffective in preventing natural rhinovirus colds. The first study, in which there was a tendency toward reduction in rhinovirus colds, prompted us to conduct a second trial at a higher dosage. Despite the higher dosage and daily administration of drug, the second trial failed to show an effect on the frequency of rhinovirus colds or any clinical benefits. The lower efficacy of rIFN-f3ser was not predicted by in vitro testing. Studies in cell culture have found comparable inhibitory effects of rIFN-u2b and rIFN-f3ser against representative rhinovirus strains [5, 6] . Also, the rhinovirus isolates from rIFN-f3ser recipients in the 1986 study had comparable sensitivities to rIFN-f3ser as did isolates from placebo recipients [5] , suggesting that resistance to the antiviral activity of this interferon did not develop in rIFN-f3ser recipients. Recombinant rIFN-f3ser administered by nasal drops also had no prophylactic effect against coxsackie A21 virus colds.

It is noteworthy that in the prior field studies rIFN-u2 was administered as nasal spray whereas our rIFN-f3ser trials were conducted with nasal drops. Nasal drops of rIFN-f3ser, however, were effective in preventing experimental rhinovirus colds [7] , and one study [12] using rIFN-U2 as treatment for experimental rhinovirus colds found greater efficacy with drops than with spray. It is possible that the efficacy of nasal drops in the challenge models relates to the fact that the viral inoculum is also given by nasal drops. Another possible explanation for the discrepant rIFN-u2b and rIFN-f3ser results is that of differing pharmacokinetics, particularly that of increased nonspecific tissue binding or natural inhibitors of interferon-f3 in nasal secretions [7, 13] . Studies with parenterally administered interferons have documented increases in peripheral blood leukocyte 2'-5'0Iigoadenylate synthetase activity [10, 14] as a marker of interferon activity. In this study, no such increases were seen in recipients of intranasal rIFN-f3ser compared with placebo, which probably indicates the lack of a systemic interferon effect.
