However, the extent to which critically ill children identified by consensus criteria reflect physician diagnosis of severe sepsis, which underlies external validity for pediatric sepsis research, is not known. We sought to determine the agreement between physician diagnosis and consensus criteria to identify pediatric patients with severe sepsis across a network of international pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). Methods: We conducted a point prevalence study involving 128 PICUs in 26 countries across 6 continents. Over the course of 5 study days, 6925 PICU patients <18 years of age were screened, and 706 with severe sepsis defined either by physician diagnosis or on the basis of 2005 International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference consensus criteria were enrolled. The primary endpoint was agreement of pediatric severe sepsis between physician diagnosis and consensus criteria as measured using Cohen's \u03ba. Secondary endpoints included characteristics and clinical outcomes for patients identified using physician diagnosis versus consensus criteria. Results: Of the 706 patients, 301 (42.6 %) met both definitions. The inter-rater agreement (\u03ba \u00b1 SE) between physician diagnosis and consensus criteria was 0.57 \u00b1 0.02. Of the 438 patients with a physician's diagnosis of severe sepsis, only 69 % (301 of 438) would have been eligible to participate in a clinical trial of pediatric severe sepsis that enrolled patients based on consensus criteria. Patients with physician-diagnosed severe sepsis who did not meet consensus criteria were younger and had lower severity of illness and lower PICU mortality than those meeting consensus criteria or both definitions. After controlling for age, severity of illness, number of comorbid conditions, and treatment in developed versus resource-limited regions, patients identified with severe sepsis by physician diagnosis alone or by consensus criteria alone did not have PICU mortality significantly different from that of patients identified by both physician diagnosis and consensus criteria. Conclusions: Physician diagnosis of pediatric severe sepsis achieved only moderate agreement with consensus criteria, with physicians diagnosing severe sepsis more broadly.

This finding is consistent with a prior report of a single-center study in the United States [10] . In general, patients with physician-diagnosed severe sepsis tended to be younger, less severely ill, and less likely to receive several sepsis-related therapies than patients who also met consensus criteria. These observations likely reflect the intention of the International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference to identify a more severely ill subgroup of critically ill children with severe sepsis for enrollment in clinical trials [6] . It may therefore be appropriate for physicians to diagnose severe sepsis more often than consensus criteria, particularly in children with a lower severity of illness who may need fewer adjunctive sepsis-related therapies. Physicians may also have been recognizing and treating children with sepsis earlier in their illness course, at a point when they may not yet have manifested the physiologic and laboratory derangements required by consensus criteria. The loss of a statistical difference in PICU mortality between patients identified by physician diagnosis alone and those identified by both definitions after correcting for severity of illness is consistent with these suppositions. A lower threshold for diagnosing severe sepsis in clinical practice likely accounts for the generally better outcome metrics identified in epidemiologic studies using administrative databases [1, 2, 5] than has been reported in clinical trials [20, [27] [28] [29] . Our study therefore suggests caution when extrapolating results from epidemiologic, observational, and interventional studies to this less severely ill subgroup of patients who are diagnosed on the basis of physician impression and do not meet consensus criteria. Conversely, the absence of certain features, such as two or more systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria [30, 31] , hypotension only after 40 ml/kg of intravenous fluid, and laboratory derangements beyond arbitrary cutpoints (e.g., international normalized ratio >2), should not preclude the clinical diagnosis of severe sepsis and/or septic shock.

Still, this observation highlights an opportunity to refine future iterations of consensus criteria and address variability in physician diagnosis to identify sepsis. Patients with preexisting neuromuscular disorders, such as cerebral palsy and epilepsy, were particularly likely to meet consensus criteria for severe sepsis despite an alternative clinical diagnosis. Many of these patients have dysautonomia or altered physiologic responses to illness that make it challenging to apply predefined rigid criteria. The higher rate of unknown primary site of infection suggests that consensus criteria may be less specific than physician diagnosis in identifying patients with a true infection. It is also possible that consensus criteria include PICU patients with a high severity of illness, namely those with shock and multiorgan system dysfunction caused by non-septic insults, who are commonly treated empirically for infection even if clinical suspicion is low. Alternatively, if physician diagnosis does not corroborate consensus criteria despite true presence of severe sepsis, there may be a higher rate of parental or clinician refusal to participate in research because the clinicians managing the patient may not agree on the diagnosis of concern. The incorporation of new biomarkers or novel microbiologic detection systems that improve early sensitivity and specificity for invasive infections into future revisions of the consensus criteria may improve alignment with physician diagnosis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "There are several limitations to this study. First, physician diagnosis and the application of consensus criteria to identify patients with severe sepsis could not be independently verified. The reasons why patients were not identified as having severe sepsis by one or both definitions were also not available. Although these concerns may have led to misclassification of some patients, it is unlikely that such a bias would have preferentially affected one group. Moreover, because we included only physicians practicing in a PICU setting, 89 % of whom were trained in pediatric critical care medicine, the level of agreement for other providers who commonly treat sepsis (e.g., emergency physicians) may differ from our results. A second limitation is that criteria used for physician diagnosis were not standardized. Although this may have increased variability in physician diagnosis across providers and sites, such an approach reflects that physicians often differ in their diagnostic approach. Third, the higher proportion of patients with available laboratory measures in the consensus criteria only and both definition groups may itself have increased the likelihood of identification by consensus criteria because, in the absence of available data, these measures were assumed to be within normal limits. Although it is more likely that sicker patients had directed laboratory testing performed than unsuspected organ dysfunction was discovered through routine laboratory testing, differential availability of laboratory results may have been a source of misclassification bias. Finally, because a \"gold standard\" does not exist, it is not possible to determine the degree to which either definition correctly identified pediatric patients with severe sepsis or compared the sensitivity and specificity of the two definitions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Physician diagnosis of pediatric severe sepsis achieved only a moderate level of agreement with consensus criteria across this multicenter, international point prevalence study. The results of a research study based on current consensus criteria may not be generalizable to nearly one-third of pediatric patients diagnosed with severe sepsis in a PICU. Further research is needed to understand the extent to which the specificity of consensus criteria and variability in physician diagnosis may be contributing to this discordant identification of pediatric severe sepsis.

Only 301 patients (42.6 %) were identified by both physician diagnosis and consensus criteria (\u03ba 0.57 \u00b1 0.02). The 31 % of patients with physician-diagnosed severe sepsis who did not meet consensus criteria were younger, had a lower severity of illness, and a lower PICU mortality than those who met consensus criteria or both definitions.
