Methods Mice were randomly divided into control, LPS, and crocin + LPS (15, 30, and 60 mg/kg) groups. HUVECs were separated into eight groups: control, crocin, matrix metalloproteinase 9 inhibitor (MMP-9 inhib), cathepsin L inhibitor (CTL inhib), LPS, MMP-9 inhib + LPS, CTL inhib + LPS, and crocin + LPS. The potential cytotoxic effect of crocin on HUVECs was mainly evaluated through methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay. Histological changes were assessed via hemotoxylin and eosin staining. Lung capillary permeability was detected on the basis of wet-dry ratio and through fluorescein isothiocyanate-albumin assay. Then, protein levels were detected through Western blot analysis, immunohistochemical staining, and immunofluorescence. Results This study showed that crocin can improve the pulmonary vascular permeability in mice with LPS-induced ARDS and inhibit the inflammatory signaling pathways of high mobility group box, nuclear factor \u03baB, and mitogen-activated protein kinase in vivo and in vitro. Crocin also protected against the degradation of endothelial glycocalyx heparan sulfate and syndecan-4 by inhibiting the expressions of CTL, heparanase, and MMP-9 in vivo and in vitro. Overall, this study revealed the protective effects of crocin on LPS-induced ARDS and elaborated their underlying mechanism. Conclusion Crocin alleviated LPS-induced ARDS by protecting against glycocalyx damage and suppressing inflammatory signaling pathways.",

The endothelial glycocalyx, a layer of negatively charged gel-like substance, exists on surfaces of pulmonary vascular endothelial cells. Heparan sulfate (HS) and syndecan-4 (SDC-4) are highly abundant in the glycocalyx [3, 4] . The endothelial glycocalyx plays an important role in albumin exudation formation, leukocyte adhesion, and anticoagulation [5] [6] [7] [8] . However, the glycocalyx undergoes dynamic changes and is susceptible to various factors. Enzymes are a key factor in glycocalyx degradation. Glasner et al. [9] reported that heparanase (HPA) and cathepsin L were connected with HS shedding in dengue virus non-structural protein 1-induced endothelial hyperpermeability. Reine et al. [10] reported that matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) was related to the degradation and shedding of SDC-4 in glomerular endothelial cells.",

However, sepsis can induce changes in the deformation ability of neutrophils in pulmonary capillary and their retention on the surfaces of endothelial cells, thereby increasing the capillary permeability of alveoli and inducing and promoting the production of inflammatory cytokines [11] . High mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1), nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways are important and common inflammatory signaling pathways in lung injury [12] [13] [14] . Activation of the inflammatory signaling pathways promotes the production and release of high levels of pro-and anti-inflammatory factors. Imbalance in the pro-and anti-inflammatory internal environment of the body leads to damage to vascular cells, cell dysfunction, adhesion or infiltration of inflammatory cells, and hemodynamic changes.",

Otherwise, HMGB-1 as an important late inflammatory factor can trigger the intracellular NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and aggravate serious injury [29] . As shown in previous reports, crocin had a strong anti-inflammatory effect in diabetic nephropathy model [18] . The results of this study also showed that crocin had the same strong anti-inflammatory effect in LPS-induced ARDS cell and animal models. However, inflammatory injury also induces the production and release of glycocalyx shedding factors (such as MMP-9 and HPA) [30, 31] . An incomplete glycocalyx may aggravate the inflammatory reaction and further spread inflammatory factors, resulting in persistent lung injury [32, 33] . The present study showed that pretreatment with crocin effectively reduced glycocalyx damage, and this protective effect may be related to inhibiting the activation of inflammatory pathways.",
