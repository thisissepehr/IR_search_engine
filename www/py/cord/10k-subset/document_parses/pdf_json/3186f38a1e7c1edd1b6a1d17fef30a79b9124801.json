In addition, infection with HBoV did not significantly influence the severity of gastroenteritis. Our results do not support a causative role for HBoV in gastroenteritis, despite its frequent detection in fecal samples worldwide. To further clarify the linkage between HBoV and gastroenteritis, future priorities should include additional case-control studies that have larger cohorts of case and control samples, the establishment of serological methods to trace the viral antigens and the immune response, and the development of an animal model for HBoV infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Make every mother and child count", "authors": [], "year": 2005, "venue": "World Health Report", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Identification of viral agents causing diarrhea among children in the Eastern Center of Tunisia", "authors": [{"first": "I", "middle": [], "last": "Fodha", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Chouikha", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "I", "middle": [], "last": "Peenze", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2006, "venue": "J Med Virol", "volume": "78", "issn": "", "pages": "1198--203", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Diversity of viruses associated with acute gastroenteritis in children hospitalized with diarrhea in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam", "authors": [{"first": "T", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Nguyen", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "F", "middle": [], "last": "Yagyu", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Okame", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2007, "venue": "J Med Virol", "volume": "79", "issn": "", "pages": "582--90", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Viruses causing gastroenteritis", "authors": [{"first": "I", "middle": [], "last": "Wilhelmi", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": [], "last": "Roman", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Sanchez-Fauquier", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2003, "venue": "Clin Microbiol Infect", "volume": "9", "issn": "", "pages": "247--62", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "Cloning of a human parvovirus by molecular screening of respiratory tract samples", "authors": [{"first": "T", "middle": [], "last": "Allander", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["T"], "last": "Tammi", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Eriksson", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Bjerkner", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Tiveljung-Lindell", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "B", "middle": [], "last": "Andersson", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2005, "venue": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "volume": "102", "issn": "", "pages": "12891--12897", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF5": {"ref_id": "b5", "title": "Detection of viruses identified recently in children with acute wheezing", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": ["Y"], "last": "Chung", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "T", "middle": ["H"], "last": "Han", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": ["W"], "last": "Kim", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": ["K"], "last": "Kim", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Hwang", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2007, "venue": "J Med Virol", "volume": "79", "issn": "", "pages": "1238--1281", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF6": {"ref_id": "b6", "title": "Human bocavirus in French children", "authors": [{"first": "V", "middle": [], "last": "Foulongne", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Y", "middle": [], "last": "Olejnik", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "V", "middle": [], "last": "Perez", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Elaerts", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Rodiere", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Segondy", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2006, "venue": "Emerg Infect Dis", "volume": "12", "issn": "", "pages": "1251--1254", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF7": {"ref_id": "b7", "title": "Human bocavirus infection among children", "authors": [{"first": "N", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Kaplan", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "W", "middle": [], "last": "Dove", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": ["F"], "last": "Abu-Zeid", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "H", "middle": ["E"], "last": "Shamoon", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Abd-Eldayem", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Hart", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2006, "venue": "Jordan.
