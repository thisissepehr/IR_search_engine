Centrolepis racemosa displays secondary unifi cation of programs of leaf development, absence of the leaf hyperphyll and loss of shoot dimorphism. Presence or absence of a leaf ligule and features of infl orescence and fl ower morphology are useful as phylogenetic characters in Centrolepidaceae.",

Flower-subtending bracts are essential in understanding infl orescence architecture (e.g., Prenner et al., 2009 ; Whipple et al., 2010 ) , and knowledge of fl ower position in an infl orescence allows adequate analysis of the spatial arrangement of phyllomes associated with fl owers (e.g., recognizing their adaxial, abaxial, or transversal position on fl oral pedicel/ axis).

Th e evolutionary origins of the grass fl ower and infl orescence are among the most controversial topics in comparative and evolutionary plant morphology (e.g., Philipson, 1985 ; Clifford, 1986 ; Cocucci and Anton, 1988 ; Kellogg, 2001 ; Skvortsov, 2003 ; Rudall et al., 2005 , Sajo et al., 2008 . This debate is fuelled in part by the high species diversity of the grass family (Poaceae) and their prominence both in worldwide ecosystems and agriculture, but also because grass fl owers and spikelets are considered to be particularly complex and specialized compared with the reproductive structures of many other monocots. Some sedges (Cyperaceae) are also problematic with respect to interpretation of fl ower-infl orescence boundaries as well as interpretation of partial infl orescences as spikelets or monochasia (e.g., Vrijdaghs et al., 2007 Vrijdaghs et al., , 2010 Prychid and Bruhl, 2013 ) . Centrolepidaceae are relatively species-poor, economically insignifi cant and geographically restricted, yet the origin and the morphological identity of their reproductive structures are enigmatic, as in grasses and sedges.",

            "text": "Whereas fl ower identity is clear and uncontroversial in Restionaceae, morphological interpretation of the basic reproductive units is contentious in Centrolepidaceae (reviewed by Sokoloff et al., 2009a ) . Th ese units are interpreted either as fl owers (euanthia) or as compact groups of reduced and oft en fused, unisexual, perianthless fl owers (pseudanthia or synanthia). Proponents of the pseudanthial concept have viewed the unusual pattern of carpel arrangement in multicarpellate species of Centrolepis (in two rows along a stalk-like structure, see Fig. 1D , E ) as the principal supporting evidence (e.g., Eichler, 1875 ; Hamann, 1962 ) . However, a recent study of gynoecia in all genera of Centrolepidaceae ( Sokoloff et al., 2009a ) found that the pattern of carpel arrangement does not contradict interpretation of the carpels as belonging to the same fl ower (see also Hieronymus, 1873 ) . In flowers of Centrolepidaceae, carpels always form a single whorl, as in most other monocots , but the whorl becomes strongly asymmetric in Centrolepis due to one-sided elongation of the receptacle ( Sokoloff et al., 2009a ) . Another possible interpretation is that the fl oral center is formed by united ventral parts of carpels rather than by the receptacle, but this alternative interpretation does not aff ect any aspects considered here. If all the carpels of a reproductive unit are viewed as belonging to a single fl ower, there is no argument against interpreting the bisexual reproductive units of Centrolepidaceae as bisexual fl owers. Th is interpretation is followed in the present paper. Multiplication of carpels within the single whorl and their placement at diff erent levels due to one-sided growth coupled with the occurrence of only one monothecal stamen ( Fig. 1D , E ) make fl owers of some Centrolepis one of most unusual and peculiar among angiosperm fl owers.",

Most species of Centrolepis possess two large bracts on the primary infl orescence axis, each subtending a lateral group of fl owers arranged in a zig-zag pattern. Th e morphological nature of these lateral structures was problematic due to the apparent absence of fl ower-subtending bracts. Hieronymus (1873) viewed the zig-zag pattern as evidence supporting the arrangement of the fl owers into a cincinnus (a kind of monochasium). Following this interpretation, the entire infl orescence could be described as a thyrse (see Endress, 2010 ) . In contrast, Bentham (1877 Bentham ( , 1878 interpreted the lateral units in infl orescences of Centrolepis as dorsiventral distichous spikelets, so that the entire infl orescence should be viewed as a double spike. Th is interpretation implies that spikelet dorsiventrality in Centrolepis involves oblique insertion of flowers. Dorsiventral spikelets with pronounced oblique insertion of fl owers are superfi cially remarkably diff erent from nondorsiventral ones ( Fig. 2A-F ) . On the other hand, in angiosperms that lack fl ower-subtending bracts entirely, dorsiventral distichous spikelets and cincinni can appear superficially very similar ( Fig. 2G-J ) . However, considerable fundamental diff erences exist between these two patterns of fl ower arrangement, allowing for divergent evolutionary and taxonomic interpretations ( Fig. 2G-J ).",

The same mode of presentation of the lateral spikelets is used in the diagrams of infl orescences of Aphelia and Centrolepis below.",

However, due to the small overall size of infl orescences with densely crowded fl owers and the tiny size of some of these phyllomes, it is diffi cult to analyze them using herbarium material and a dissecting microscope (i.e., the common taxonomic approach). As a result, current knowledge of phyllomes associated with fl owers of Centrolepidaceae is inadequate. For example, Cooke (1995) in his detailed revision of Australian Centrolepis did not describe the spatial arrangement of the phyllomes; a feature regarded as taxonomically important by Hou (1957) , although the latter considered only the three Malesian species. In this present paper, using SEM investigations, we document the occurrence in some species of additional phyllomes that are not mentioned in the taxonomic literature.",

Distichy is well recognizable on shoots with conspicuous internodes and relatively sparse branching, as in our material of Gaimardia setacea Hook.f. ( Fig. 3A ) and G. fi tzgeraldii Rodway. As pointed out by Cooke (1992) , the basically distichous phyllotaxis is obscured in most species of Centrolepis by the crowding of leaves from the numerous growing points forming each tuft , sometimes producing a false spiral phyllotaxis in species with numerous linear leaves such as C. strigosa (R.Br.) Roem. & Schult. Our data confi rm the occurrence of plants with basically distichous (to spirodistichous) phyllotaxis obscured by extensive branching (e.g., in C. milleri ). However, in many species with densely crowded leaves (e.g., Centrolepis fascicularis , C. strigosa , C. racemosa , Gaimardia australis Gaudich., and Aphelia nutans Hook.f. ex Benth.), we found true spiral phyllotaxis. When vegetative leaves are distichous, the pattern of phyllotaxis does not change on transition to an inflorescence. In species with spiral phyllotaxis, except C. racemosa , the pattern changes to distichy on transition to an infl orescence. In C. racemosa , the Fibonacci spiral continues directly to the infl orescence.",

Th e cotyledon ( Fig. 3E , I ) has an open sheathing base with membranous margins and a fi liform photosynthetic lamina with a haustorial tip that remains associated with the endosperm and seed coat up to the time of anthesis and fruit set; there is no ligule. Th e main shoot produces foliage leaves immediately aft er the cotyledon in all species of Aphelia and Centrolepis for which we have observations. Lateral shoots of Gaimardia possess a bladeless adaxial prophyll forming an open membranous sheath. In G. setacea and G. fi tzgeraldii ( Fig. 3A ) , the prophyll is followed by foliage leaves. Th e fi rst foliage leaf is abaxial and the plane of distichy of lateral shoots is almost the same as that of the main shoot. In G. australis , the leaf following the prophyll is also abaxial, but has a reduced lamina; other leaves have normal laminas and follow a spiral pattern. In Aphelia ( Fig. 3D ) and Centrolepis ( Fig. 3H ) , lateral shoots lack an adaxial prophyll, and the leaf series starts with two leaves in transversal or obliquely transversal positions (these can be interpreted as prophylls analogous to those of most eudicots). If the shoots are distichous, the plane of distichy of a lateral shoot is perpendicular to that of the main shoot. In Centrolepis , the fi rst leaves of the lateral shoots are normally foliage leaves ( Fig. 3H ). An exception was found in plants of C. polygyna (R.Br.) Hieron., which bear branches of several orders. Branches of higher orders did not form foliage leaves at all and the two fi rst phyllomes were bladeless cataphylls. In Aphelia , one ( Fig. 3D ) or two fi rst leaves of lateral shoots are membranous bladeless cataphylls. Th ese can be followed by foliage leaves (or a single foliage leaf; rarely all leaves are foliage leaves). However, one or two cataphylls may be the only leaves produced by a lateral shoot before its transition to an infl orescence. In small plants of Aphelia , the only vegetative foliage leaves are on the main shoot, but in vigorous plants, there also are foliage leaves on at least some lateral shoots. Both patterns are recorded in the same species ( A. cyperoides R.Br.). We did not record shoot branching in the axil of the prophyll of Gaimardia , but branching oft en takes place in the axils of the fi rst leaf (as well as subsequent leaves) in Aphelia and Centrolepis (e.g., in Fig. 3H there is branching in the axil of the fi rst leaf of a second order shoot, labeled 1).",

Th e lamina is elliptical in cross section and possesses one to three vascular bundles. In Aphelia and Centrolepis , the vegetative foliage leaves have an open sheath with membranous margins ( Fig. 3F , J, N ) and a fi liform lamina with single vascular bundle. According to Cooke (1995 Cooke ( , 1998 , a ligule is absent from both Aphelia and Centrolepis , though a minute ligule is reportedly present in C. monogyna (Hook.f.) Benth. ( Cooke, 1992 ) . In our taxon sampling, a ligule was present in Aphelia ( Fig. 3D , F ) and absent in Centrolepis ( Fig. 3J , N ). Ligule length increases sequentially in leaves along the main shoot in Aphelia . Th e leaf blade is likely unifacial in Aphelia and Gaimardia , though developmental data are needed to test this hypothesis. In Centrolepis aristata (R.Br.) Roem. & Schult., the membranous margins of the sheathing base are continuous with longitudinal ribs in the proximal part of the lamina and there is no ligule ( Fig. 3N ). Th ese ribs can be interpreted as borders of adaxial and abaxial surfaces and thus, blades of the vegetative leaves of Centrolepis are bifacial. However, the ribs are not clearly recognizable in many species of the genus (e.g., Fig. 3J ), but again, there is no ligule.",

In our opinion, the zig-zag curvature does not indicate that the infl orescence axis is sympodial, as proposed earlier by Cooke (1995) with respect to Aphelia . Its monopodial nature is supported by two arguments. (1) Phyllomes of the primary infl orescence axis bear axillary structures (usually spikelets, see below), easily interpretable in the monopodial model. If a sympodial model is followed, these spikelets could be viewed as terminal, but in this case, the continuation of the primary infl orescence axis appears to be a lateral branch without a subtending phyllome, which is a relatively complex interpretation. (2) Th e zig-zag curvature appears late in infl orescence development. Th e young infl orescence axis is straight ( Fig. 6G ) .",

Of these species, we here investigated A. nutans and A. brizula F. Muell. All phyllomes normally have a base that encircles approximately one half of the circumference of the infl orescence axis (Fig. D in Appendix S1; Figs. A, E, F in Appendix S2), but the width of the base of the fi rst phyllome is variable (Figs. C, E in Appendix S1). Distal phyllomes have sheathing bases only (a very short lamina is rarely present in A. brizula ); the proximal phyllomes vary in presence or absence and length of the lamina (in A. nutans , the lamina is only rarely present and always short). Ligules are present only in phyllomes with well-developed laminas. In both species, the distal phyllomes diff er from the two proximal ones in the presence of incurved basal auricles and conspicuous hairs along the membranous margins (at least in their basal portion, extending into the auricles). In A. brizula (Figs. D-F in online Appendix S3), all phyllomes are strongly folded along their midline (the folding is not shown in the diagram in Fig. 4G ), resulting in Relative arrangement of organs as seen in serial sections perpendicular to the primary infl orescence axis; however, all the structures appearing at all consecutive nodes of the primary infl orescence axis have been placed in the plane of a single diagram. We interpret the structures in the axils of the phyllomes of the primary infl orescence axis of Aphelia as lateral dorsiventral spikelets whose axes are parallel to the plane of the diagram (and located just below this plane, as explained for the spikelet diagram in Fig. 2 ) . In E, all lateral spikelets one-fl owered. In F and H, all but the fi rst lateral spikelets are one-fl owered. In G, all but the two lower spikelets are one-fl owered.

Th e second cell is longer and thinner than the lower cell and its tip is either straight or slightly twisted.

Of these, our sampling covers three species. In all three species, the base of the upper phyllome about one half surrounds the infl orescence axis, but that of the lower phyllome almost completely encircles the axis ( Figs. 3K, 8D, 8E, 8H, 8I ). In C. polygyna ( Fig. 8D -G ) and C. glabra ( Fig. 8H ) , the lower phyllome has a sheathing base with membranous margins and a long or short fi liform lamina, while the upper phyllome lacks a lamina ( Fig. 8D, H ) ; both phyllomes lack any hairs or papillae. In C. polygyna ( Fig. 8F, G ) , the membranous margins of the sheathing base extend distally into the ventral side of the lower phyllome, but their bases are not adjacent to each other, as described above. In the space between their distal ends, a transverse ridge is present ( Fig. 8G ). Anatomical investigation clearly shows that this ridge is the boundary between the adaxial and abaxial surfaces, whose histological patterns diff er dramatically in the bifacial sheathing base. However, the lamina is unifacial, rounded in cross section, with a uniform epidermis and subepidermal chlorenchyma across the section. In C. glabra , the membranous margins do not extend distally onto the ventral side and the lamina is slightly fl attened ( Fig. 8H ). Th is leaf could be bifacial, but more comparative and developmental data are required to test this hypothesis. In C. milleri ( Figs. 3K, 3L, 8I ), the lower phyllome lacks hairs or papillae. It has a laterally compressed sheath ( Figs. 3K, 8I ) that extends distally into very short auricles and a lamina that is longer than the auricles ( Fig. 3L ) . Th e upper phyllome has a sheath with a smooth central region and papillate membranous margins distally prolonged into very short auricles and a lamina that is about as short as the auricles ( Fig. 8I ). In both phyllomes, the margins of the sheathing base extend distally only slightly onto the ventral surface, so that there is a clear gap between them ( Fig. 3L ) , as in the lower phyllome of C. glabra . On the other hand, the lamina is rounded or almost rounded in cross section, as in the lower phyllome of C. polygyna .",

In these taxa, each phyllome on the primary infl orescence axis directly subtends a fl ower (see Fig. 5D , E ). We see no evidence for any more complex interpretation (e.g., for interpreting each fl ower as a reduced one-fl owered spikelet). In the reduced one-fl owered spikelets of C. polygyna (see below), the orientation of monosymmetric fl owers with respect to the phyllome of the primary infl orescence axis is almost opposite that of C. racemosa . In C. polygyna , the stamen of a unistaminate fl ower is closer to the subtending phyllome of the one-fl owered spikelet (see Fig. 8D : phyllome is labeled by an asterisk), while in C. racemosa , the stamen is closer to the primary infl orescence axis ( Fig. 7D ).",

In a group of species of Centrolepis with dimorphic phyllomes on the primary inflorescence axis (here represented by C. milleri , Fig. 7C ; C. polygyna , C. glabra ), only the upper phyllome subtends a spikelet (which is Th e lateral spikelets in infl orescences of Centrolepis in both species groups discussed are dorsiventral ( Figs. 7A-C, 9D-C ). Dorsiventrality is manifested by the fact that the fl owers are oriented toward the adaxial side of the infl orescence axis. Th is dorsiventrality clearly refl ects the spatial constraints created by the massive phyllomes of the primary infl orescence axis that subtend spikelets (the phyllomes are massive in the context of small-sized plants of Centrolepis ). Flowers of Centrolepis are either all bisexual, or sometimes proximal fl owers in spikelets are bisexual, while the distal fl owers (or fl ower) are female (e.g., C. drummondiana , C. glabra ).",

As outlined later, fl owers of Aphelia are associated with two phyllomes of diff erent morphology, which are spaced in a precise way with respect to a stamen and/or a carpel.

C, E in Appendix S1). Its position is intermediate between adaxial and basiscopic transversal. Phyllome 2 is much longer than phyllome 1 in mature fl owers and its base is much broader ( Figs. 6C ; Fig. B in Appendix S1, Figs. C-E in Appendix S2, Fig. E in Appendix S3, Fig. C in Appendix S4). It is membranous and has two cell layers (the outer and inner epidermises) throughout its length (Figs. C, D in Appendix S2), sometimes with a discontinuous internal cell layer. Th e margins are covered by hairs or glabrous. Phyllome 2 is typically folded inward along an eccentric midline to enclose a stamen and/or a carpel in preanthetic fl owers. In female fl owers of A. brizula , the midline of the phyllome is keeled, with a row of thin hairs along the keel (Fig. D in Appendix S3). Phyllome 2 of Aphelia species is usually broadest just above the base and its margin closest to phyllome 1 is folded either outward (i.e., toward the primary infl orescence axis) or inward (both conditions can be found in the same species, A. cyperoides , Figs. 6C , Fig. B in Appendix S2). When the margin is folded outward ( Fig. 6C ) , phyllome 2 superfi cially appears to be outermost relative to phyllome 1; when the margin is folded inward (Fig. B in Appendix S2), the phyllome 1 appears to be the outermost one. Since the bases of phyllomes 1 and 2 usually do not overlap, it is not possible to determine whether one of them is the lowermost or outermost. However, in cases where we observed real overlapping of the bases (lines of attachment), phyllome 1 was always outermost (Fig. C in Appendix S3); hence the numbering used here. Developmentally, phyllomes 1 and 2 appear in a very rapid sequence and phyllome 2 soon becomes crescent-shaped ( Figs. 6F, G ; Figs. D, E in Appendix S1; Figs. A, B in Appendix S3; Fig. F in Appendix S4). At least in some cases, we were able to document that phyllome 1 is initiated slightly before phyllome 2 and that the primordium of the latter is relatively narrow at initiation.",

In the current study, having examined two more species and more material of C. exserta , we were unable to document young stages with only a single phyllome present. Th erefore, the two or three phyllomes are initiated either simultaneously or in a very rapid sequence. Figures 9B and 9C ( C. banksii ) and 11A and 11B ( C. curta ) show spikelets where the youngest fl owers already possess all phyllomes.

The relative lengths of the two conspicuous phyllomes depend on species and stages of development (though we lack data on actual initiation of the phyllomes).

To summarize, stamen position is similar in Aphelia and Centrolepis , while the position of the fi rst-formed carpel in Centrolepis diff ers from that of the solitary carpel of Aphelia ( Fig. 10 ) Th e gynoecium of Aphelia consists of a single carpel. In Australasian species of Gaimardia , the gynoecium is syncarpous with long synascidiate, short symplicate, and long asymplicate zones; the two carpels are inserted at the same level ( Sokoloff et al., 2009a ) . Th ere are no data on the anatomy of anthetic fl owers in G. australis. In Centrolepis , the carpels form a single whorl, which is strongly monosymmetric in anthetic fl owers. Initiation of the carpels is somewhat staggered and due to the one-sided growth of the receptacle, the last-formed carpels are inserted at higher levels than the fi rst-formed carpels; the result is that the carpels appear to be arranged in two rows along a stalk-like extended receptacle. With the extended taxon sampling here, we are able to recognize two types of structure and development of pluricarpellate gynoecia in Centrolepis .",

Another peculiar feature of G. australis is the long stalk-like base of the fruit, which is longer than the dehiscing region that contains the seeds ( Fig. 5H ) .",

            "text": "In contrast, our data on Centrolepidaceae show that the spiral phyllotaxy on the primary infl orescence axis is an autapomorphy of C. racemosa . In a more general context, this feature of C. racemosa can be viewed as a reversal, because outgroups of Centrolepidaceae such as Restionaceae have spiral phyllotaxy in their infl orescences (e.g., Kircher, 1986 ) . Kellogg et al. (2013) reconstructed the spiral phyllotaxy in infl orescences of Centrolepis as a feature inherited from a common ancestor with Restionaceae. However, this conclusion was biased by insuffi cient taxon sampling in Centrolepidaceae. Th eir interpretation of fl ower arrangement in C. aristata as spiral ( Kellogg et al., 2013 ; their fi g. 1D and E illustrates a dorsiventral lateral spikelet) is contradicted by our results, which demonstrate that the phyllomes on the primary infl orescence axis are distichous in all Centrolepidaceae except C. racemosa . Kellogg et al. (2013) highlighted the phylogenetic signifi cance of diff erences in phyllotaxis within the two-ranked pattern in grass infl orescences. Th ey used the term \"distichous\" for cases in which the two ranks of primary branches are initiated at angles of 180 \u00b0 and \"two-ranked\" if the ranks are less than180 \u00b0 apart on one side of the inflorescence. Thus, \"distichous\" is a subset of \"tworanked. \" Th e two terms are identical etymologically (Greek stikhos means a row or a line), so we prefer to use them as synonyms. Th e second condition, in which the two ranks are less than 180 \u00b0 apart on one side of the axis, is an example of pendulum symmetry, which is viewed here as the regular alternation of mirror-shaped metamers on distichous shoots, where it is correlated with dorsiventrality ( Charlton, 1997 ) . Pendulum symmetry is characteristic of distichous shoots of various taxa across the angiosperms ( Charlton, 1997 , see also Goebel, 1882 Goebel, , 1913 Sokoloff et al., 2007 ; Prenner, 2013 ) .",

Grass rhizomes are also oft en dorsiventral, because axillary buds are displaced around the axis away from the midline (or the midline itself is displaced?); left -hand and right-hand displacement regularly alternate at nodes along a rhizome ( Bell and Bryan, 2008 ) . A potential correlation between pendulum symmetry in the vegetative shoot and the infl orescence axis would merit further exploration. Goebel (1913) observed that in some legumes and grasses, dorsiventrality characterizes the entire plant. As noted by Kellogg et al. (2013) , the developmental basis for the regulation of dorsiventrality remains unknown in grasses. Pendulum symmetry is such a common feature in distichous shoots across angiosperms that we predict common patterns of developmental regulation, based on the regulation of distichy. Since pendulum symmetry occurs in model systems such as cereals and legumes [ Lotus japonicas (Regel) K.Larsen, see Sokoloff et al., 2007 ] , a comparative analysis of its genetic control is potentially achievable.",

Th is feature is common among monocots, including grasses and Restionaceae, and therefore we interpret it as plesiomorphic in Centrolepidaceae. When shoots are distichous in Gaimardia , the plane of distichy is the same in both mother and daughter shoots. In contrast, in grasses, the plane of distichy is transversal with respect to the axil of a subtending leaf (both in vegetative parts and inflorescences, e.g., Smirnov, 1953 ) . The arrangement of the fi rst two leaves in the transversal positions is a synapomorphy of Aphelia + Centrolepis and when shoots are distichous, the plane of distichy of a lateral shoot is perpendicular to that of the primary shoot, as in grasses. Th ese diff erent patterns of initiation could indicate that distichy has appeared more than once during the evolution of the graminid clade. Linder and Caddick (2001) suggested that the ligulate foliage leaves of Restionaceae and Centrolepidaceae have unifacial laminas. In their interpretation, the ligule margin represents a morphological boundary between the abaxial and adaxial morphological surfaces, so that both surfaces are present in the leaf sheath but only the abaxial one in the lamina. Th is interpretation is supported by the fact that the laminas are oft en elliptical to almost round in cross section in both families. In terete laminas, epidermal characters do not show a clear boundary between the abaxial and abaxial surfaces ( Cutler, 1969 ) . In Centrolepidaceae ( Hieronymus, 1873 ; Cooke, 1992 ; Tillich, 1995 Tillich, , 2007 Kellogg et al., 2013 ;  this study) and those Restionaceae that have epigeal germination ( Linder and Caddick, 2001 ; Tillich, 2007 ) , the terete photosynthetic part of the cotyledon (phaneromer sensu Tillich, 2007 ) resembles the lamina of foliage leaves. Morphologically, the phaneromer is the proximal region of the cotyledonary hyperphyll ( Oberblatt ). Th e hyperphyll of Centrolepidaceae and Restionaceae is interpreted as unifacial ( Tillich, 2007 ) , and it is tempting to adopt the same interpretation for the (broadly similar) laminas of epicotyledonary leaves.",

            "text": "On the other hand, there are arguments against interpreting all laminas in Restionaceae and Centrolepidaceae as unifacial. When the lamina has three vascular bundles (e.g., in Gaimardia spp.), the bundles are arranged in the same plane, as would be expected in a bifacial leaf ( Cutler, 1969 ) . A ligule is absent in many Restionaceae, and its presence is not universal in Centrolepidaceae. In vegetative nonligulate leaves of Restionaceae ( Briggs et al., 2014 ) and Centrolepis (this study), the margins of the sheathing base are continued into the lamina, though the ribs indicating the presumed boundary between the abaxial and adaxial surfaces soon disappear along the length of a lamina, at least in our material of Centrolepis . Briggs et al. (2014) highlighted a narrow groove, interpreted as the adaxial surface, on the upper side of a lamina in Anarthriaceae and those Restionaceae that possess more developed laminae. Although Briggs et al. (2014) termed such laminae unifacial, they are, in their interpretation, fundamentally bifacial, with very narrow adaxial surface (subunifacial: see Ozerova and Timonin, 2009 , for a review of terminology). Briggs et al. (2014) also recognized a narrow adaxial surface in the leaf lamina of Centrolepis and Gaimardia , but this observation seems less convincing based on their illustrations. Arber (1922 ;  see also Goebel, 1913 ; Cutler, 1969 ) described the lamina of phyllomes on the primary infl orescence axis of C. aristata as belonging to an extremely reduced ensiform type, with a second bundle above the median bundle, resulting from the fusion of two laterals. However, only one bundle is present in the vegetative leaves ( Arber, 1922 ) . Th is diff erence fi ts well with our data where only phyllomes on the infl orescence axis are ligulate.",

Normally, monochasial vs. racemose types of fl ower arrangement can be distinguished using the relative positions of fl owers, fl ower-subtending bracts and infl orescence axes. However, this criterion is equivocal in Centrolepis , because of problems in distinguishing the fl ower-subtending bracts from tepals (see below). We believe that the sporadic occurrence of partial infl orescences with three rows of fl owers (documented here for the fi rst time for Centrolepis ) further supports their interpretation as spikelets, rather than cincinni. Indeed, both tristichous and distichous partial inflorescences are accommodated readily by the spikelet model, diff ering merely in the phyllotaxis along the spikelet axis (1/2 and 1/3).

At fi rst glance, the variation in number of fl ower rows found in Centrolepis suggests a comparison with pair-fl owered cincinni. Pairfl owered cymes, which are probably restricted to certain members of the eudicot order Lamiales ( Weber, 2013 ) have axes of all orders ended in a pair of fl owers rather than a fl ower. Compact cincinni of Epithema Blume (Gesneriaceae, Weber, 1976 : fi g. 7) indeed superfi cially resemble the partial infl orescences of Centrolepis . However, they possess four, rather than three rows of fl owers; four rows is precisely what should be expected theoretically in such a pattern of fl ower arrangement. Four rows of fl owers should be also expected in a geminifl orous cincinnus. A geminifl orous cyme is a special type of cyme with one of the two dichasial branches reduced to a single fl ower ( Weber, 2013 ) . In theory, a pattern with three rows of fl owers can be found when geminifl orous (or pair-fl owered) cymes are alternating regularly with normal cymes along a cincinnus, but this would be an extremely complex explanation. To our knowledge, nothing similar is found in any other monocots. We accept the much simpler spikelet model.",

Th e presence of only one spikelet correlates with dimorphic morphology of the phyllomes of the primary infl orescence axis. Th e upper phyllome (that subtends the only remaining spikelet) is narrower and shorter than the lower phyllome. Clearly, the lower phyllome of species of Group 2 plays an important protective role for the spikelet. Among the species not sampled here and not studied developmentally, lower spikelets can be either present or absent in C. mutica (R.Br.) Hieron. ( Barrett and Sokoloff , 2015 ) . In some species with two spikelets ( C. aristata , C. pilosa of Group 3, see Fig. 13 ), the upper lateral spikelet was more advanced developmentally than the lower lateral spikelet of the same infl orescence. Th is can be regarded as a step toward a complete loss of the lower spikelet. Th us, a tendency to suppression and loss of the lower spikelet can be seen in Centrolepis , at least in Groups 2 and 3. We did not record pronounced developmental retardation of the lower spikelet in examined members of the Group 1. Is this an argument in favor of a potentially close phylogenetic relationship between species of Groups 2 and 3 (as in Fig. 13A , B )? Published molecular phylogenetic data ( Briggs et al., 2014 ) are insuffi cient to resolve this issue, due to relatively low taxon sampling in Centrolepis .",

Our data show that species with two conspicuous phyllomes belong to two diff erent groups and that members of these groups diff er in position of the phyllomes (the diff erences are scored in characters 30 and 31 of our data matrix). In species of Group 3 (see Fig. 13A : C. aristata , C. fascicularis , C. pilosa , C. drummondiana ), both long phyllomes are located on the adaxial side of the fl ower, but on different radii ( Fig. 10H , long phyllomes are thick blue arcs). In the group of tropical annuals of Group 1 ( C. banksii , C. exserta , C. curta , C. racemosa ), one long membranous phyllome is adaxial, and the other is abaxial ( Fig. 10D -F , long phyllomes are thick blue lines). Centrolepis strigosa (a basal member of a clade comprising species of Group 1) has three long, conspicuous phyllomes ( Fig.  10G ) and could be considered intermediate between species of the Group 3 and tropical annuals because the two phyllomes on the adaxial side of a fl ower are in the same positions as in Group 3, but there is also a conspicuous phyllome on the abaxial side, as in tropical annuals. Th e position of C. strigosa inferred from the morphological cladistic analysis is perfectly compatible with its intermediacy between members of Group 3 and tropical annuals.",

Centrolepis glabra ( Fig. 10J ) and C. polygyna form a clade (Group 2) with C. milleri, but diff er from it in the presence of a single phyllome associated with a fl ower. Th e phyllome is short and abaxial to basiscopic. Th erefore, we believe that this single phyllome is homologous with the short phyllome of C. milleri and Group 3.",

At fi rst sight, these phyllomes appear comparable with those of Centrolepis milleri . However, in terms of phylogeny, C. milleri is not closely related to Aphelia . Also, the long membranous phyllome of Aphelia is adaxial/basiscopic rather than merely adaxial, while the long membranous phyllome of C. milleri is adaxial/acroscopic. Th erefore, the two long phyllomes are unlikely to be homologous. Th e short phyllome of C. milleri has a broad base and consists of two cell layers, as in Group 3 of Centrolepis , whereas the short phyllome of Aphelia has a narrow base and consists of more than two cell layers. In these characters, the short phyllome of Aphelia resembles the vestigial fl ower-subtending bracts of C. banksii , C. curta , and C. exserta , but the hypothesis on their homologies requires further testing.",

All other phyllomes of Aphelia and Centrolepis belong to the fl oral axis. We speculate that these phyllomes can be interpreted as tepals rather than fl oral prophylls (bracteoles) because fl oral prophylls are not recorded in the closely related family Restionaceae ( Kircher, 1986 ) . In species of Centrolepis with three tepals (Group 3 and C. strigosa ), the adaxial/ basiscopic tepal occupies in an inner position with respect to the other two, so we interpret it as an inner-whorl tepal, strongly associated (or even basally fused) with the stamen. Strong association between stamens and tepals occurs in a broad range of monocots (reviewed by Endress, 1995 ; Remizowa et al., 2010 ) , indeed, it is more common between inner-whorl stamens and tepals (petals) than between outer-whorl stamens and tepals (sepals). In Restionaceae, the family most closely related to Centrolepidaceae, only inner-whorl stamens are present, either as fertile stamens or as staminodes in functionally male fl owers ( Ronse De Craene et al., 2001 , 2002 ; these inner-whorl stamens are basally connected with the inner-whorl tepals (H. P. Linder, University of Zurich, personal communication, 2011).",

Its similarities with Aphelia (numerous phyllomes of the primary infl orescence axis) and Australasian Gaimardia (plants diaxial: fl owers borne directly in the axils of phyllomes of the primary axis) should probably be interpreted as homoplasies. Centrolepis racemosa clearly belongs to Centrolepis and, more precisely, falls into the group of tropical species that is defi ned by a suite of fl oral features. Although its phylogenetic position in the tropical group (predicted by Sokoloff et al., 2009b ) is supported by the current study, C. racemosa diff ers from other tropical species and in fact from all other species of Centrolepis in an impressive list of characters (online Appendix S7). Our phylogenetic analysis provided two alternative hypotheses for a potential sister-group relationship of C. racemosa (both within the group of tropical annuals), one with C. curta ( Fig. 13C ) and the other in an unresolved position among other tropical annuals ( Fig. 13B ) . Th ese two topologies imply that the branch leading to C. racemosa is eight or nine steps long, respectively. In all shortest trees found, the branch leading to C. racemosa is the longest branch within Centrolepidaceae. In contrast, the branch length for its potential sister groups is either zero ( C. curta , Fig. 13C ), or 1-2 steps (see Fig. 13B ).",

Shoot apical meristems of phylogenetically related species of Centrolepis produce three distinct types of phyllomes in a precise sequence, i.e., the foliage leaves, the cataphylls and the phyllomes of the primary infl orescence axis (Appendix S7). In C. racemosa , all the phyllomes produced by the shoot apical meristem are basically similar to each other. In other species of Centrolepis , the leaf lamina is formed by the hyperphyll ( Oberblatt ), at least in phyllomes of the primary infl orescence axis. In C. racemosa , the leaves are apparently formed by the hypophyll only (its leaves lack clear demarcation between hypophyll and hyperphyll). In Centrolepis species other than C. racemosa , the infl orescence is clearly demarcated from the vegetative part of a shoot. Th e last internode before the infl orescence (the fi nal internode) is the only long internode in many species (though not in C. curta ). In many species, phyllotaxy changes at the transition to the infl orescence, but in C. racemosa , the boundary of the infl orescence is not sharp (an empty phyllome is sometimes inserted between the two fl owersubtending phyllomes), the basal internode is not diff erentiated, and there is no phyllotactic change at the transition to the infl orescence. In other species of Centrolepis , spiral phyllotaxy, when present, is confi ned to the vegetative parts of the shoot.",

Th is is the approach that we used in our cladistic analysis. Long branches like the one leading to C. racemosa in our analysis are thought to be indicators of saltational events, so that all character transformations in the branch could result from a single mutation ( Bateman and DiMichele, 2002 ; see also Nuraliev et al., 2014 ) .",

Th is diff erence is in accordance with the high phylogenetic distance between the grasses and Brassicaceae.
