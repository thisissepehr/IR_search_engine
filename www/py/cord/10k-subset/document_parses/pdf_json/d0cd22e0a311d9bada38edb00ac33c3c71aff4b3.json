Tonsillitis due to beta haemolytic streptococci is a well recognised triggering factor for both guttate and palmoplanter psoriasis. Between 25 and 50 percent of patients with psoriasis experience worsening of their skin condition after an attack of tonsillitis. We reviewed 13 patients with recalcitrant psoriasis exacerbated by recurrent tonsillitis who underwent tonsillectomy over four years, There were 12 females and one male with a mean age of 17 years, 6-28. Six patients had guttate psoriasis and seven patients plaque psoriasis. Patients were followed by chart review and postal questionnaire Full follow up was available on all patients. Psoriasis cleared completely after tonsillectomy in 7 patients, improved in 3 patients and was unchanged in 3 patients The guttate group did better than the plaque psoriasis group. We discuss the rational and indications for tonsillectomy in the psoriatic patient. Before 1985 drug management of hypertension comprised the \"stepped care\" approach, i.e. start with a diuretic (D), add a beta blocker (B), then a vasodilator (V) and/or neuronal blocker depending on the BP response.

Despite appropriate antimicrobial chemotherapy, the mortality rates associated with severe bacterial infections remain high. To improve prognosis, prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential. Thus, the development of early detection methods would be advantageous. Since IgG antibody binding receptors (FcTRI FcTRII and FcTRIII) are important mediators of phagocytosis, measurement of these receptors could be useful in the early detection of infection t~). In this study Fc~R expression was measured on the neutrophils and monocytes of 38 patients suspected of systemic infection and compared to FcTR expression in 30 healthy blood donors. Of the 38patients tested, 17 were blood culture positive, 7 were blood culture negative but had severe bacterial infection at localised sites and the remaining 14 had no cultural evidence of infection. FcTR expression was measured using flow cytometry. There was no significant difference in the expression of FcyRI on neutrophils or monocytes in patients with systemic Vs localised infection, (p=0.27, p=0.25) respectively. Fc~,RI expression was, however, significantly increased in both these infected groups, compared to patients without evidence of infection for neutrophils (p=0.0007, p=0.0001) and monocytes (p=0.03, p=0.02) and compared to controls, p<0.0001, in all cases. The expression of FcTRII did not differ significantly between the patient groups, although patients with systemic or localised infection were significantly different to controls for both neutrophils (p=0.003, p=0.01) and monocytes (p=0.004, p=0.0004). Measurement of FcyRIII was not useful in distinguishing the different patient groups from controls. This data suggests that increased FcTRI expression on neutrophils or monocytes may be a useful rapid indicator of bacterial infection. The efficacy and scheduling of BCG and its potential to interfere with the interpretation of the tuberculin test as a screening tool are debated.

These findings have important implications for the development of new therapies for patients with RA. College and National Maternity Hospital, Dublin. Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HEG) has frequently been associated with thyroid hyperfunction. In the present study the prevalence of Thyrotrophin Receptor Antibodies (TRAb) in whole serum and IgG concentrates prepared in serum from patients with HEG was compared with those obtained from \"well\" patients studied during the first trimester of pregnancy (T1) and in non-pregnant controls. TRAb was measured using using a radioreceptor assay. Sera and IgG concentrates which produced inhibition of E25I TSH binding to thyroid membranes >15.0% were termed positive. TRAb were positive in 7/56 (12.5%) of patients requiring hospitalisation for HEG. Of 19 \"'well\" T1 pregnancy patients, one (5.2%) was TRAb positive. Similarly only 1/22 (4.5%) of non-pregnant female controls was TRAb positive. When IgG concentrates were prepared from sera by PEG (50%) precipitation, positivity increased to 10/11 (91.0%) in HEG and a 16/19 (84.2%) in \"well\" T1 pregnancy. In order to investigate a possible role for hCG in influencing TRAb positivity in pregnancy, known concentrations of hCG (62.5 -500x 103 IU/L) were added to an incubation mixture containing TRAb negative serum. Inhibition of ~25I TSH binding increased from 6.4%-22.3% with increasing hCG. The results suggest the presence of a non-hCG TSH binding inhibitor in sera from patients with HEG. They also emphasise the need to exert caution in interpreting results of TRAb investigations, particularly in IgG concentrates prepared from pregnancy sera. We present a most unusual case of neonatal thyrotoxicosis in premature twins. The mother of the twins has Graves disease, was thyrotoxic for two years, becoming hypothyroid one and a half years prior to delivery during which time she was maintained on L-Thyroxine. During pregnancy she developed rising levels of thyrotrophin receptor antibodies (TRAb) which had been absent in early pregnancy rising to 70% inhibition of J25-I labelled TSH binding at 26 weeks gestation. Twin boys were delivered vaginally at 30 weeks + 6 days gestation. Both boys were significantly hyperactive. Twin 1 developed intermittent tachycardia which resolved spontaneously, he displayed no inability,-persistently fed well and had good weight gain. Peak TRAb on Day 2 was 61.4%. Twin 2 developed tachycardia from day 8 which became increasingly severe necessitating treatment with propranolol. Weight gain was also poor despite adequate intake. The twins, now nine months of age remain under followup. At review both twins are thriving and propranolol treatment has been discontinued for twin two. These findings demonstrate the importance of thyrotrophin receptor antibodies (TRAb) in monitoring neonatal thyrotoxicosis. The report outlines the course of neonatal thyrotoxicosis and demonstrates the need for careful evaluation of offspring born to mothers with thyroid disease. A large number of publications have reported a high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in elderly subjects. Secondary hyperparathyroidism in association with hypovitaminosis D is now being diagnosed with increasing frequency probably due to the advent of more sensitive assays for intact parathyroid hormone. The effect of high dose Vitamin D supplementation in correcting SHPT in a patient with stress fractures is presented; serum PTH decreasing from 6.9 -2.2 pmol/L as serum 25(OH)D increased from 14-128 nmol/L. The concentration of serum 25(0H)D necessary for restoration of serum PTH to the adult reference range may be as high as 70 nmol/L in patients who have developed SHPT.",

The Queen's University of Belfast Lipoprotein Lp(a) is a variant of low-density lipoprotein and subjects with values >30 mg/dl have greatly increased risk of coronary heart disease. Lp(a) levels are strongly influenced by genetic factors. It was of interest to measure Lp(a) levels in very elderly subjects, who as survivors of their peer group, might be expected to show a predominance of lower values of Lp(a) consistent with a reduced risk profile for atherosclerosis. In this preliminary study, 129 elderly subjects, who were apparently well and living in the community, were enlisted -60 subjects > 90 years of age, 35 subjects > 80 years of age and 32 subjects 65-80 years of age. Lp(a) was measured by standard immunoassay methods (Immunozym).",

Lp(a) values, in the 'at risk' range for atherosclerosis, are present in a higher percentage of well nonagenanan subjects, than are present in 'younger' old groups. This finding is surprising in view of the expectation that risk factors for coronary heart-disease might be reduced in nonagenarian subjects who by virtue of their age have survived premature heart disease. Helicobacter pylori is associated with a wide range of gastroduodenal pathology from asymptomatic carriage through gastritis and/or peptic ulcer disease to gastric cancer. The aim of this study was to assess whether H. pylori-related diseases are associated with specific strains using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fingerprinting technique. H. pylori stain was isolated from each of 40 individuals including 35 patients with duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer, non-ulcer dyspepsia and five asymptomatic volunteers. The organisms were subcultured on chocolate agar for 3-5 days and the cells of each strain were harvested. H. pylori DNA was extracted by the phenol/chloroform method and amplified using the polymerase chain reaction-based RAPD with a combination of two 10-nt primers. Electrophoresis of RAPD products on 2% agarose gel yielded DNA profiles (fingerprints) of DNA of each strain. The fingerprints of strains were compared with their corresponding clinical gastroduodenal disease status. RAPD fingerprinting with a combination of the two primers yielded 10-20 main bands on the agarose gels. The profiles of the PCR products of DNA from all the 40 strains were different from each other. There were no specific bands that associated with the clinical outcome of gastroduodenal pathology. In conclusion, the strains ofH. pylori may not be disease specific and the host response to the infection may determine the clinical outcome.",

We have been studying the molecular genetics of a family with an inherited autosomal dominant predisposition to colorectal cancer. This family has a phenotype atypical of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), with an average age of diagnosis at 68 years, (later than classical FAP) but it falls within the range of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal carcinoma (HNPCC). However, some family members contain up to 25 colonic polyps, more than the usual number for HNPCC. There is a possibility that an attenuated form of FAP -attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli (AAPC) -is involved. This phenotype, represented by a later age of onset and fewer polyps than classical FAP, is due to less deleterious germline mutations in the APC gene. Attempting to elucidate the nature of this kindred's form of colorectal cancer, we have proceeded with genetic analysis. The results indicate that previously identified conserved and nonconserved single base-pair changes have been shown not to be responsible by single strand conformational polymorphism and heteroduplex analysis. Thus, we have undertaken linkage analysis of the APC gene on chromosome 5 (the disease locus for FAP), using 5 highly informative polymorphic markers flanking the APC gene to determine if alterations in this gene are responsible for the condition. Melanoma is the most lethal of cutaneous malignancies accounting for 85% of skin cancer related deaths. The aim of this study was to assess survival and identify prognostic indicators in all melanoma patients treated at a single institution over a 9 year period. 232 patients (167 females, 65 males) mean age 50 years (range 5-92 years) were treated. All had stage 1 disease at presentation, lower limb (41%) was the most frequently affected site in females and trunk (38%) in males. 64% of the melanomas were invasive, 50% nodular and 46% superficial spreading. Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan Meier methodology and the overall 5 year survival was found to be 81%, with the majority of deaths occurring within 2 years of diagnosis. Multivariate analysis using a logistic regression model identified Breslow thickness as being the only independent statistically significant determinant of prognosis, emphasising the importance of early diagnosis and prompt referral in this disease.",

It occurs most commonly after prolonged exposure to infra red radiation at a level lower than that which produces an acute thermal burn. Reports of bullae formation in erythema AB IGNE are very rare. We report three cases of bullous erythema AB IGNE that presented to our clinics over a two year period. Histologically the split occurred at the level of the dermo-epidermal junction similar to that seen in seconddegree thermal burns. Direct immunofluorescence of perilesional skin was normal in two patients. We have found only two previous cases of erythema AB IGNE associated with bullae formation in the literature 1'2. In one of these cases the histology suggested a coexistent lichen planus. In our three cases, there was no evidence of lichen planus. We propose that thermal injury in erythema AB !GNE may result in bullae formation, and that erythema AB IGNE is more frequently associated with sub-epidermal bullae than is hitherto reported. Vasculitis may have many causes. Immunoglobulin deposition may be a non specific finding but IgA deposition is thought to be mainly associated with Henoch Schonlein Purpura (HSP) and may convey a greater risk of renal disease. We studied all patients diagnosed over the past seven years with vasculitis characterised by IgA deposits in the blood vessel walls. Patients were identified retrospectively from laboratory records and clinical details obtained from hospital notes. Twenty-seven patients (age range 17-70 years) with IgA vasculitis were identified, 14 females and 13 males.

Biopsies of flexural skin revealed elastic fibre abnormalities on EM confirming a diagnosis of PXE. His asymptomatic parents and siblings (N=3) were similarly assessed. Cutaneous examination was normal in all cases. One sibling demonstrated swollen fragmented elastic fibres with elastic Van Gieson stain. EM examination showed evidence of the characteristic elastic fibre abnormality in these cases and also in their asymptomatic 70 year old mother. The pedigree pattern clearly supports an AD pattern of inheritance. We propose that EM examination of clinically normal flexural skin is a useful tool in the detection of PXE or of the asymptomatic carrier state. We present epidemiological data on 456 patients with psoriasis vulgaris (probands) attending a dermatology clinic, directly questioned about age of onset and family history of the disease. 191 (41.9%) were male, 265 (58.1%) female, mean age was 28.3 SD _+ 18.4, mean age of onset 21.5 SD \u2022 16.2. 405 (25.2%) presented before 40, M:F 1:1.4, 115 (25.2%) before 10, M:F ratio l:l 7. Age of onset declined steadily for men after 40, in women a greater number still developed the disease. 198 (43%) of probands had an affected 1 ~ relative, 24 (5.3%) a 2 ~ relative. Probands with earlier age of onset had a higher % of affected relatives, 58.3% between 0-9, 7.1% between 40-49, suggesting stronger genetic influence with earlier onset. 333 (72.6%) of probands had neither parent affected, 121 (26.3%) had 1 parent and 4 (0.9%) both parents. 68 (20.5%) probands with neither parent involved, had another sibling affected. These results do not favour simple autosomal dominant or x-linked recessive or dominant inheritance. An autosomal recessive pattern with a lower than expected frequency due to delayed age of onset could account for our figure of 20.5%. Dublin. Dermatophyte nail infection is regarded as rare in children with a reported prevalence of 0.2%, as compared to between 2-5% in adults, rising with the age of population studied. We document its occurrence in the paediatric age group with 3 case reports of tinea unguium occurring in healthy children, ages ranging from 7 to 14 years from different families, presenting over a 6 month period. All were asymptomatic but presented because of the distressing and dystrophic appearance of their nails. All cultured trichophyton rubrum species and only one had an associated tinea pedis. We show carriage of asymptomatic T.Rubrum on clinically normal toe-nails of other family members in 2 of the 4 cases, which may act as a reservoir for transmission of infection. We suggest that the prevalence of onychomycosis in children may be increasing and that certain subpopulations of young children are more at risk. We speculate as regards the lower prevalence in children, compared to adults but stress the importance of correct diagnosis at presentation by appropriate mycological assessment. Mutant p53 & bcl-2 inhibit apoptosis and allow tumour proliferation. In malignant melanoma bcl-2 expression is most prominent in the radial growth phase. In this study we compared bcl-2 expression in 13 nodular and 13 acrallentiginous malignant melanomas and looked at Ki-67 expression, a known proliferative marker and determined any relationship with prognostic variables. Mean bcl-2 staining score in the acral lentiginous group was 2.6 compared to a score of 1.7 in nodular variant (P<0.05). Bcl-2 protein expression was not associated significantly with mitosis, Breslow thickness or survival. Percentage of positive Ki-67 cells varied considerably and did not correlate with mitotic index and survival. The novel observation of markedly increased bcl-2 expression in the acral-lentiginous group of melanoma suggests that this variant of malignant melanoma is biologically different from nodular malignant melanoma. We hypothesise that the acrallentiginous variant of malignant melanoma is protected intrinsically from stresses that induce cellular apoptosis, for example ionising radiation and chemotherapy.",

Clinical, laboratory, histological and immunological markers of coeliac disease activation were evaluated. All patients remained asymptomatic throughout the challenge period and no laboratory evidence of malabsorption was found. There was no mucosal damage seen on routine histological examinaton of post challenge duodenal biopsies. Surface enterocyte height remained unchanged and intraepithelial lymphocyte counts were also unaltered following challenge. Furthermore, oats did not cause immunological activation since no rise in alpha gliadin or endomysial antibodies or in MHC class II staining of enterocytes was evident. This study demonstrates that oats is neither toxic nor immunogenic in coeliac disease and oats does not appear to contain the putative toxic peptide sequence found in the 3 other cereals. Erasmus University Rotterdam, Holland; Regional Transfusion Centre, Bristol, U.K A major complication of Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT) is Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) which is mediated by donor T cells. Abrogation of GvHD while preserving stem cell repopulating ability might allow an increase in the donor panel for BMT. In vitro evidence suggests that ultraviolet B light(UV-B) can inhibit T cell reactivity. A prospective study of time to engraftment, chimerism kinetics and long term repopulating ability (LTRA) of UV-B treated marrow precursors was performed in a murine BMT model. Irradiated animals were rescued with an inoculum of donor cells treated with varying doses of UV-B. Animals were sampled at weeks 1-4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 26 and assessed by PCR of Short Tandem Repeat Sequences. In semi allogeneic BMT, 20 animals were studied. At low UV-B doses (< 1,000 J/m 2) donor engraftment was delayed, whereas doses of 2,000 J/m 2 or more never resulted in donor chimerism. There was no significant GvHD in control or UV-B treated animals. In the more immuno-aggressive allogeneic BMT 18 animals were studied. 5/6 control animals died of GvHD. At 1000 J/m 2, there was no significant GvHD and 4/6 animals were long term donor chimeras. At 2,000J/m 2 there was no evidence of GvHD but no animal became a donor chimera. These results indicate: 1. High doses of UV-B may affect stem cell function (semi-allogeneic studies). 2. There may be an optimal dose of UV-B that prevents development of GvHD while preserving LTRA of stem cells (allogeneic studies). Complement deficiencies are best detected using haemolytic assays because these assays allow for screening for activity in all components. Haemolytic assays have been developed that allow determination of both functional activity and identification of the missing component, when late acting complement component deficiencies (LCCD) exist. We have further developed this assay system to include activity of certain classical components such as C2, because C2 deficiency is the most common complement deficiency, but difficult to detect by antigenic assays. We applied these assays in studies in two Irish families. In one family a 14 year old girl from Co. Tipperary presented with a third episode of severe meningococcal septicaemia and meningitis. Testing revealed that she and a younger sibling have complete deficiency of the eighth complement component (C8D) whereas three other siblings, and the parents, have normal C8 activity. The other index case was a woman from Dublin with a history of recurrent meningoccal disease. She and two sisters were found to have complete C6 deficiency (C6Q0) (one sister was tested in the USA) and both these sisters have a history of meningococcal disease. Of three other siblings with no history of infection, one was tested and found to be complement sufficient, as were all the children of the index case and one affected sister. Several approaches to prophylaxis for these cases can be considered. They include counselling, the use of the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine (which gives limited protection) and long term penicillin prophylaxis. Gastrointestinal (GI) infection is a common cause of morbidity in young animals. Evidence is emerging that oral immunisation of the gastrointestinal tract with specific immunoglobulin (Ig) provides protection against intestinal pathogens.

Abnormalities of the autonomic nervous system in Alzheimer's disease have been suggested by previous studies of the cardiovascular response to standing. In this study, 12 outpatients having Dementia of the Alzheimer Type (Clinical Dementia Rating, Score ~ 1 ; mean age _+ SEM, 74 + 2 years) were continuously monitored using Finapress and their responses to the Valsalva manoeuvre and positional change were compared with 12 age matched (73 _+ 1 years) healthy elderly controls. Mean resting supine blood pressure and heart rate were not different between the two groups. Although both groups had the predicted tachycardia during the Valsalva manoeuvre, on opening the glottis only the controls showed the typical bradycardia (-10.2 +_ 2.6 versus +6.2 _+ 3.7 beats per minute, b.p.m., for the patients, P<0.01). When the subjects stood, there was a similar increase in systolic blood presure for both groups. In contrast, whereas controls had a robust tachycardia (+18.6 _+ b.p.m.) this was not the case for the Alzheimer's patients (+5.8 _+ 2.8 b.p.m., P<0.01). This indicates diminished baroreceptor cardiac reflexes in mild Alzheimer's disease. B/A4 amyloid is thought to be responsible for much of the pathology observed in Alzheimer's disease. We studied its ability to induce neurodegeneration following intrahippocampal injection in rats. Male Wistar rats received \"injections of: a) Soluble B/A4 (1-40, 7.5 lag) and N-methyl D-aspartate (4.4 lag), b) Aggregated B/A4 and NMDA, c) Aggregated B/A4, d) Vehicle (water), intrahippocampally (CA1-CA3) via an indwelling cannula over a 3 week period. The hippocampal lesion, cannula tract areas and numbers of cell bodies within the pyramidal cell layer were measured in 10 lam sections (week 8). All injections produced localised tissue destruction, neuronal loss and reactive gliosis. The relative damage was expressed as the ratio of total damage versus cannula damage. We found that aggregated B/ A4 appeared to be substantially more damaging than soluble amyloid, while the vehicle alone had little effect. NMDA appeared to potentiate the toxic effect of the aggregated B/A4. This suggests that B/A4 is indeed neurotoxic, especially when aggregated and with co activation of NMDA receptors. Success with long term prophylactic therapy requires patient compliance and education. We reviewed case records and questioned 35 consecutive outpatients with grand mal epilepsy concerning their medication . Patients were receiving largely mono-therapy carbamezepine (15), phenytoin (10) and sodium valproate (5). The mean age was 42 years (range 14-81); 14 were female. Almost half (43%) were fit free during the previous year. Most knew the name and dose (71%), some (23%) name only and 6% knew neither. About half reported drowsiness and tiredness with their medication and 31% claimed it caused hair loss. Only 5 (14%) did not attribute any side effect to their medication. Patients, including 2 on warfarin, were unaware of potential drug interactions, and almost 30% were unaware of possible problems with driving, drinking, alcohol or pregnancy despite prescribers advising on these topics when initiating therapy. On the other hand almost all knew what to do if a dose was missed, attended for therapeutic drug monitoring, and requested more information about medication. Additional education including written information and reminders concerning therapy could be valuable and would be appreciated by patients with epilepsy.

Precise, powerful and sometimes subtle in their effects, lasers are increasingly important medical tools which have yet to find any major application in orthopaedic surgery. In one area, the increasing numbers of re-operations carried out on total hip replacement patients cause considerable difficulty for orthopaedic surgeons. One particular problem lies in the removal of the bone cement inserted during the primary operation, without causing damage to the bone. In order to develop a method for differentiating between polymethyl methacrylate bone cement and bone during laser ablation, the laser-induced fluorescence from bone cement has been studied and compared to that from the bone. An Oriel multispec spectrometer was used to analyse and record the radiation emitted in the range 340-840nm during 248nm excimer laser ablation. There was very high intensity fluorescence from bone relative to that from bone cement and several peaks occurred in the spectrum of bone which were absent from that of bone cement. Monitoring of this emission has enabled controlled laser ablation of bone cement in contact with bone to be achieved in vitro with no damage to the naked eye. This has shown the potential of controlling the power of laser surgery to solve the problem of cement removal. The aetiology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is believed to involve both environmental and genetic factors. A large part of the inherited component is associated with a shared epitope (SE) found in several DRB alleles. Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFc~) both because of its chromosomal localisation in the major histocompatibility complex and biological effects, is a candidate gene underlying the genetic association of the MHC with susceptibility to, or severity of, rheumatoid arthritis. We have recently described the first known polymorphism in the TNFot gene and shown that the rare allele (TNF2) lies on the extended haplotype A1-B8-DR3-DQ2. We have therefore examined the genetic contribution of this polymorphism in RA.",

Patients (n = 45) with controlled hypertension for at least 6 months (a BP < 160/ 95 mmHg) were randomised to continued medication (C) (n = 24) or withdrawal (W) (n = 21). Drug therapy was recommended if BP exceeded 160/95 mmHg on any visit. Both groups were counselled regarding lifestyle by their GP and reviewed at least monthly for 9 months. Both groups were initially similar for BP, heart rate, age, duration of therapy, total cholesterol and body mass index. 3 subjects (1 from the W and 2 from the C group) did not complete monitoring. There were no cardiovascular events. 71% of W subjects remained off drug therapy at 9 months (15 of 21) with mean BP of 144/85 mmHg (W) and 139/86 mmHg (C). No significant differences were observed in mean systolic or diastolic BP, heart rate, or body mass index between the two groups after 9 months (MANOVA). The W group h~td a 6% reduction in body mass index after 9 months. Successful W group patients had lower baseline diastolic BP than u n s u c c e s s f u l subjects (p<0.05). On multivariate analysis, physical activity level at 9 months was the best predictor of change in systolic (r2=0.20) and diastolic BP (r2=0.12) over the study. A proportion of motivated hypertensive patients can cease drug therapy and be adequately maintained by lifestyle advice from their GP for at least 9 months. Cessation of drug therapy may be an important motivating factor for lifestyle change. Diarrhoea is a significant cause of morbidity, particularly in the elderly.

Conventional methods of assessment of the anal sphincters primarily provide functional rather than anatomical information. Anal endosonography is the only modality providing direct visualisation of the sphincters. The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of the 120 ~ sector scanner (more widely available than the 360 ~ transducer previously described) in the identification of anal sphincter defects. 75 women were examined in the left lateral and prone positions by a Toshiba PVL 516s sector scanner. Neither the patients' symptoms nor the results of anal manometry and pudendal nerve terminal latencies were known to the ultrasound operator and the examinations were assessed by two independent observers. 79% (n=59) had abnormal transanal ultrasound. Of these 19% (n=l l) had defects of the internal sphincter; 20% (n=12) had external sphincter defects; 36 (61%) had defects of both. All patients had abnormal manometry. We conclude that endosonography using a 120 ~ sector scanner provides a reliable and well tolerated adjunct to conventional methods for assessing the anal sphincters.

Women whose babies had a congenital malformation or perinatal death were excluded~ 520 women completed the questionnaire (a 63% response rate). Parity, health plan status, antenatal class attendance, awareness of delivery types, analgesia and labour length were studied. Visual analogue scores (VAS) were recorded for satisfaction with pain relief during and after labour and for care during labour. The majority of women (65% VAS 7 or >) were satisfied with care in labour. Factors significantlyassociated with such satisfaction were good analgesia during labour (specifically epidural), vaginal delivery, adequate preparation for labour and if personal concerns were listened to by staff. 98.5% had hoped for a vaginal delivery (VD) and 1.5% for caesarean section (CS) -(actual rates -81% VD, 10% CS, 9% operative VD). 81% felt they had been adequately listened to by staff.

To determine whether this effect was selective for platelets, prostacyclin formation was measured as the urinary excretion of its metabolite, 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF w In pregnant subjects, excretion of PGI-M was elevated (476_+54, n=7; normal <220 pg/mg creatinine) when measured on two separate days. Neither aspirin preparation altered prostacyclin generation. In contrast, urinary TX-M decreased by more than 90% following 7 days of treatment with either preparation.",

Although negative attitudes toward Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) patients have been reported ~, the quality of care delivered has been inadequately addressed. Therefore, the aims were, to measure: 1). Nurses' expressed comfort with AIDS care, 2). Behavioural intention toward AIDS patients, 3). Knowledge of AIDS, and 4). Attitudes towards AIDS. A random sample of both psychiatric and general nurses were surveyed, using an 150-item questionnaire comprising a). demographic details, b). a 80-item Nursing Care Expressed Comfort Scale which included 4 behavioural sub-scales measuring: willingness, avoidance, refusal intention and caution, c). 19 attitude items measuring: stress, prejudice, and risk perception d). a 21-item knowledge scale. A response rate of 97% (N=155) was obtained. While 63% (98) were willing to nurse an HIV/AIDS patient, 51% (78) would be uncomfortable with being assignmed to an AIDS ward and 12% uncomfortable with nursing an AIDS patient. All respondents expressed some level of avoidance with regard some aspects of AIDS care. Five percent (8) were tested for HIV after an occupational injury. In the case of those who would be uncomfortable, the findings imply that the care AIDS patients receive may be less than desirable. The question then, is if voluntary allocation to AIDS care may be of more benefit to all parties involved. The:health service is one of the leading employers in Ireland and Great Britain. Its occupational health (OH) services vary enormously or are absent in health boards and voluntary hospitals in Ireland. Health service employees are exposed to numerous hazards -for example needlestick injuries -so adequat e use of their OH department is important. This project investigated i) the knowledge and attitude of health care workers within the United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS) regarding their OH department, and ii) their awareness of policy for needlestick injuries. A questionnaire was sent to 300 NHS employees: the response rate following a second mailing was 51%.",

A number of recent publications have described mladels of liaison child psychiatry service provision, but the actual work of such a service has not been described. The present study reviews the work of a liaison child psychiatry service in a 266-bedded paediatric hospital from January to December 1993. The service which was provided by three consultant child psychiatrists included two components, a) weekly psychosocial ward rounds with specialist paediatric teams, b) direct referrals from paediatrics to child psychiatry. Two hundred and thirty three young people were referred, representing 1.4% of all adaissions during the same period. Reasons for referral included for clarification of the role of emotional factors in paediatric presentations in 104 cases (44%), and for assessment of deliberate self harm, anxiety or depression in 72 cases (30%). Rates of referral increased with age of the child, most being in the 11-15 year age range, with equal numbers of boys and girls being referred. Referral rates were much higher from paediatricians than from paediatric surgeons, although rates of emotional and behavioural disorder are equally common in children attending these services. Increasing awareness of the importance of psychological factors in the management of both acute and chronic paediatric disorders is focusing attention on the development and efficacy of liaison child psychiatry services. Lactase enzyme reduces the lactose content of milks, and is available as \"Lactaid\" an \"over the counter\" preparation.

There was a slight spontaneous change in milk osmolality over 24 hours. At 24 hours, osmolality ranged from 386 to 416 mOsm/Kg with one drop of added Lactaid; and from 474 to 591 mOsm/Kg with four drops. The rate of change of osmolality was maximum in the first four hours, and Lactaid exerted the majority of its effect within the first 12 hours. Lactaid incubation time can be reduced to less than 12 hours. However the osmolalities achieved after incubation exceeded both the MRC1 and CONAPP2 guidelines for infant formulas. There is a wide variation in the osmolality of formulas reconstituted from powder. Postpartum depression is well recognised. However, the occurrence of elation or hypomania in the postpartum period and the effect that childbirth has on partners is less understood. Over a six week period 385 mothers and their partners were asked to complete the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the 'Highs' Scale and 82% (N=317) took part. At six weeks postpartum, 12% (N=29) of mothers scored 13 on the EPDS; higher scores were associated with bottle feeding (P=0.001), unemployment (P=0.003), failure to attend ante-natal care (P=0.02), babies that were difficult to manage (P<0.001), and maternal health problems (P<0.001). Only 1.2% (N=2) of partners scored 13 on the EPDS; higher scores were associated with fewer years in formal education (P=0.003) and unemployment (P=0.009). Using the cut-off of 8 on the Highs scale, at Six weeks, 9.6% (N=23) of mothers and 13.3% (N=17) of partners were classified as 'cases'. Maternal 'highs' scores were associated with bottle feeding (P=0.03), fewer years in formal education (P=0.02), unemployment (P=0.02), and failure to attend for antenatal care (P=0.005). Partners' 'highs' scores related only to partner age (P=0.001). Depression and elation scores were strongly associated with one another in both the mother and partner groups (P=0.001). These findings suggest a complex and not mutually exclusive relationship between depression and elation in the postpartum period and identify possible predictors of mood disturbance in both mothers and their partners that may impact on treatment strategies.

There is growing interest in asssessing measures of deficit symptoms in studies of the course of schizophrenia. It is postulated that although overlapping, negative and deficit symptoms are not co-extensive. The Quality of Life Scale (QLS) is a 21 item scale, based on a semi-structured interview designed to assess deficit symptoms.

There were 31 males and 33 females with a mean age of 36.30 years (SD 12.13) and mean duration of illness of 10.55 years (SD 7.70). The mean QLS score was 51.70 (SD 21.50 and range 13 to 108) indicating moderate to severe impairment of functioning. Total SANS and all the individual SANS subscores were strongly negatively correlated with total QLS score (p<0.001) as was duration of illness (p<0.001). Educational attainment was associated with better quality of life. Age at diagnosis and gender were not correlated with QLS score. These findings suggest that premorbid functioning, duration of illness and negative symptoms adversely impact on the outcome of schizophrenia. Recurrent nightmares occur in up to 5% of the population and are associated with insomnia, irritability, tiredness, anxiety and depression. Nightmares resemble phobias in that stereotyped cues trigger anxiety and result in avoidance behaviour. Several case reports and treatment trials support the value of behavioral treatment in recurrent nightmares. We have conducted a treatment trial to focus on the exposure method (also known rehearsal relief). 171 suitable subjects were recruited following an advertisement in the media. They suffered weekly nightmares for at least a year and were randomised into one of three groups, exposure, relaxation or waiting list. The complete trial was administered by post including measures, diaries and treatments. Exposure treatment reduced the average frequency of nightmares by 50%; significantly better than relaxation treatment and waiting list control. Other measures including depression and anxiety diminished significantly in the exposure treatment group. There was an average 18 deaths per year in psychiatric inpatients accounting for 6% of all suicides per annum. The rate of suicide in short stay inpatients (stay less than one year) was 319/100,000. The rate for long stay (stay more than 1 year) 118 per 100,000. The suicide rate for all inpatients increased fourfold in a 100 years while the rate in the general population rose by a factor of eight. 35% of suicides were 25-34 years. 63 (47%) had depression and 52 (39%) schizophrenia. 46% made previous suicide attempt. The risk of suicide was higher the shorter the time interval after admission. 110 (74%) suicides in those registered as psychiatric inpatients occurred while patient was away from the hospital. 52 (35%0) were absent without leave. -Conclusion: The high rate of suicide immediately after admission and the number who leave hospital emphasises the importance of careful management of patients at risk of suicide in a safe secure environment. The person year method is appropriate for monitoring changes in suicide rates. Lifestyle plays a key role in determining both the duration and quality of life. Personal advice from health professionals can exert a powerful influence on health behaviour of patients.

Other prognostic factors studied included: maternal age, sex, mother's county of residence, season of birth and presence or absence of other congenital anomalies, specifically congenital heart disease (CHD) and gastro-intestinal anomalies.

If contracted in pregnancy it may cause non-immune hydrops foetalis and foetal death in up to 10%. We describe the first outbreak of B19 infection in this country. In December, 1993, a cluster of 6 pupils with typical \"slapped cheeks\" rash occurred in a Dublin primary school and the diagnosis was laboratory confirmed using serology. Information leaflets on the infection were circulated to parents and management guidelines to physicians. In June, 1994, the parents of all pupils were asked whether their child had the suggested symptoms during the previous 6 months. 16% of pupils had such symptoms. Of these, 85% had slapped cheeks, 62% had rash elsewhere. The rash was evanescent (i.e. waxed and waned) in 72%. The mean duration of symptoms was 10 days. 57% reported spread to family members. 65% were aware of the illness which may have been due to the information campaign mounted at the time of the initial outbreak. 88% had not seen a similar rash before. None of the teachers had clinical symptoms. Six months after the initial outbreak, parvovirus lgG antibody was detected in salivary samples of 62% of the pupils, a level higher than that usually detected in the adult population.

A recent Japanese study presented evidence of an allelic association between a dinucliotide repeat polymorphism in the promoter region of the NT3 gene and schizophrenia in a population of 70 schizophrenics compared With 70 controlled. We have examined the frequency of the alleles at this polymorphism in 175 caucasian schizophrenic patients and 147 control subjects.

Of all the EUROCAT registries, Dublin had the highest birth prevalence of neural tube defects for the period 1980-1990 (28.9/10,000), but this fell from almost 50/10,000 to 15/10,000 over the ll year period. Of all the EUROCAT Although the majority of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) are cured following chemotherapy, the prognosis for patients in 2nd or subsequent clinical remissions (CR) remains poor. Allogeneic BMT is associated with a 40% disease free survival but is often limited due to,lack of a HLA identical sibling donor. This study was undertaken to investigate hemopoietic chimerism following MUD BMT for ALL in 2nd or subsequent CR. Clinical outcome was unknown at time of study. Chimerism post BMT was assessed by amplification of polymorphic short tandem repeats using PCR.. 17 patients have been evaluated from 1-18 months post BMT. 5 patients exhibited donor chimerism (DC); in 2 of these patients, DC persisted at all times post BMT and these patients remained in CR. In 3 patients DC evolved to mixed chimerism (MC) and was predictive of subsequent relapse. 5 patients exhibited stable low level MC (level of recipient cells <I%) and all remain in CR. 7 patients showed initially high or progressive MC post BMT. Although ALL can be treated with chemotherapy/BMT, this may only result in reduction of disease burden without eradication of the leukemic clone. Persistence of low numbers of leukemia cells in patients in \"apparent\" clinical remission is termed Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) and may allow relapse prediction. Culture based studies were used to detect leukemic precursors in ALL patients. Initial studies focussed on two semi solid assays. Cells from 36 patients with B precursor ALL at diagnosis were grown using either assay system but leukemic blast cell colonies were only detected for 50% of diagnostic samples. This prompted a change to a system with allogeneic stroma as a feeder layer to prevent apoptotic death of ALL precursors, Stromal layers were grown from normal donor marrow in 25cm cell culture flasks. Intrinsic stromal hemopoiesis was abrogated by removing all non-adherent cells after 24 hours. When a confluent layer was obtained (4-6 weeks), it was detached and replated into wells of a 24-well culture dish. Bone marrow cells from patients with ALL (diagnosis/remission) were cultured on stroma for 7 days. Contents of the wells were removed and stained with an anti-CDl9 antibody. Subsequent analysis on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson) allowed percentage recovery of B cells from the system to be calculated. 7 samples have been cultured in this system and % CD19+ cell recovery evaluated. Culture of further samples is required to test efficacy in the growth of ALL cells, particularly from remission samples. To elucidate the mechanism of inhibition of platelet aggregation by pyridoxal-5'-phosphate(PLP). Platelet aggregation was determined using the Chronolog 430 aggregometer. Phospholipids were extracted by the method of Bligh & Dyer ~0, separated by t.l.c., located by iodine vapour and extracted and analysed for phosphate (Bartlett~2~), PLP (10raM) luas shown to inhibit aggregation of platelet rich plasma and of platelets resuspended in Tyrode solution. Analysis of the phospholipid fractions showed that aggregation caused a decrease in phosphatidyl choline, phosphatidyl ethanolamine and phosphatidic acid with concomitant increase in the lysophosphatidyl choline and lysophosphatidyl ethanolamine and in the combined phosphoinositide/phosphatidylserine fraction. Inhibition of the aggregation by PLP was associated with inhibition of these changes in phospholipid components. These results point to the direct effect of PLP on phospholipase A2; an effect on phospholipase C is less clear and requires further study. Ionised calcium plays a key role in platelet function \"~. Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) inhibits platelet aggregation ~2~. This study was carried out to detect an effect of PLP on Ca 2 \u00a7 mobilisation in human platelets.

PLP(10mM) potentiated both platelet aggregation and Ca 2+ mobilisation induced by the Ca2+-ionophore, bromo-R23187. This potentiation was not observed in the absence of extracellular Ca 2+. Here PLP may exert its effect through direct or indirect inhibition of Na+/H \u00a7 exchange, leading to cytosolic acidification, which in the presence of extracellular Ca 2+ would facilitate exchange of H + for Ca 2 \u00a7 mediated by the ionophore. Since the establishment of the Irish Unrelated Bone Marrow Registry, 11 donors have donated, 1 in 1992, 1 in 1993 and 9 in 1994 for patients in Ireland (3), Europe (4) and U.S. (4). Ten have donated bone marrow and 2 donated peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). The volume of marrow harvested under G.A. varied from 595 mls -1,200 mls (mean 897 mls/depending on patient weight). Engraftment occurred in 8/10 marrow harvests and in the PBSC harvest. One patient who failed to engraft subsequently engrafted with PBSC from the same donor. Six of the eleven patients are alive and well 4-15 months after transplantation. The most common complication suffered by donors was prolonged discomfort delaying return to work (3 female). One of the two donors who donated PBSC following GCSF developed moderate thrombocytopenia Which resolved spontaneously. All but one of the marrow donors indicated their willingness to donate again if requested, but the complications of this procedure suggest that PBSC collection with GCSF may be a more acceptable method of harvest for donors. However, the effects of GCSF need to be carefully monitored as experience in normal donors is limited. The lymphocyte homing receptor (CD44) is involved in lymphocyte adhesion to endothelial cells of high endothelial venules and lymphocyte exit from the blood. There is considerable evidence that it may be involved in haematogenous dissemination of malignant lymphoma. CD44 expression was determined in a series of 36 consecutive patients with primary gastro-intestinal non Hodgkins lymphoma who have been followed up for a period of up to ten years.

Antibiotic audit of in-patients in the MMH is undertaken to evaluate both existing practices and the trends in treatment of infection. Information on the influence of microbiology reports on choice of therapy is also recorded. The audit is undertaken by examining patient's records on the wards, and consulting relevant nursing personnel and medical staff. Three hundred and forty four and three hundred and eight five patients were audited in 1993 and 1994 respectively. 60% received antibiotics in 1993 compared to 50% in 1991. 48% of surgical patients received antibiotics for prophylaxis in 1993 and this rose to 78% in 1994. The commonest infections treated were respiratory and urinary. Duration of therapy for urinary infections fell from eight to five days and for respiratory infections an increase from six to eight days was noted. There was a 15% increase in switch from IV to oral antibiotics over the period. Choice of antimicrobial agent was seen to be appropriate in the majority of cases. Neisseria meningitidis isolates can be characterized by the use of epidemiological tools such as polysaccharide capsule serogrouping, class 1 and 2 outer-membrane protein serosubtyping, and multi-locus enzyme electrophoresis. We used these assays to study case isolates from individuals with deficiency of the late acting complement components (LCCD). These individuals have increased susceptibility to recurrent meningococcal disease, but some disease manifestations may be less severe in the absence of complement activity. Alternatively deficient subjects may become infected with less virulent organisms. Sixteen N. meningitidis strains were recovered from cases with known LCCD (all C6 deficiency) and were compared with 122 routine case isolates (obtained from the same area, during the same time period). Common serogroups, particularly B, predominated in both patient groups. However, rare serogroups were significantly more prevalent in deficient patients. Sero-subtyping showed no significant differences. Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis revealed the same genetic diversity in isolates from both groups. However, the ET-5 complex (which is associated with epidemic disease) was found in 18% of the routine clinical isolates but in none from the LCCD subjects. Moreover, a highly significant finding We investigated antibodies to HEV in sera from 500 antenatal patients and 100 consecutive samples sent to our laboratory for serological diagnosis of viral hepatitis. Antenatal samples are readily available, and represent the seroprevalence of HEV in the general population in Ireland. The viral hepatitis screens were negative for hepatitis A and B. Antibodies to hepatitis C were detected in 3 of the 100 samples.",

A study was undertaken to confirm the reliability of Random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) as a fingerprinting method for the gram negative organism, Enterobacter cloacae. Previously, a group of seven E. cloacae isolates, collected from an Intensive Care outbreak of infection with this organism, and two control strains, had been investigated with RAPD. The PCRbased fingerprinting method was readily applied to this organism providing sufficient discrimination to permit differentiation between strains with identical biochemical profiles and antibiograms. Subsequently these isolates have been further characterised by a second well established genotypic fingerprinting method -pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The bacterial strain to strain differentiation established by RAPD analsis was independently confirmed using PFGE, thus establishing the reliability of RAPD as a fingerprinting method for E. cloacae. Bovine herpes mammillitis (BHM) is an ulcerative disease of the teats and udder which usually occurs in recently calved heifers and cows. It is caused by bovine herpesvirus 2 which is more closely related to human herpes simplex virus than to any bovid herpesvirus. To assess the usefulness of serology as a diagnostic/confirmatory method, 2,000 sera from unaffected cattle and 212 samples from 19 outbreaks of BHM were examined for antibodies using a serum neutralisation test incubated at 32~ The presence of specific IgM in paired samples was detected by titre elevation in the presence of complement. Low titred antibody (GMT 8) was detected in 7% of the national herd. By contrast, in investigating the 19 outbreaks, high titred antibody (GMT 21) was detected in 89/ 114 single samples and in all herds examined. Much higher antibody titres (GMT 37) were present in cattle with BHM compared to their unaffected herd-mates (GMT 12). High IgM and total antibody titres were detected in the first of paired samples (GMT 4:2), demonstrating that antibody concentrations had peaked early and had began to decline quickly (GMT 7 in second samples). The results demonstrate that a clinical diagnosis of BHM can be corroborated by the detection of high titred total antibody or IgM, often in the earliest samples collected. Fungal infections are a major cause of morbidity in critically ill surgical patients? We assessed the incidence of candidiasis in a general surgical ITU, the characteristics common to patients with postoperative candidiasis 'and the efficacy of regular surveillance cultures in providing early detection. All surgical patients who remained in ITU for more than 24 hours were included in the study. The presence of established risk factors for the development of candidiasis was noted. 2 Twice weekly urinary surveillance cultures were taken. Blood cultures were performed where clinically indicated 50 patients were studied. 9 patients developed urinary candidiasis (18%), 2 of these developed a candida septicaemia. Distinguishing candidiasis patients from those with bacterial' sepsis is a difficult clinical problem. Long hospitalisation and parenteral nutrition, multiple operations and antibiotics are well known predisposing factors to candidiasis. Similar predisposing factors were found to be significant in the present study also. Regular urinary surveillance cultures may be useful in the early detection and management of these patients. Classical swine fever (CSF) is a peracute to chronic disease of domestic pigs and wild boar which continues to occur in extensive outbreaks in the EU. Ireland is at risk of importation of CSF virus (CSFV) via live pigs or meat products. Isolation of CSFV is currently performed in cell cultures grown cn flying coverslips, followed by virus detection using fluorescent antibody staining. However, this method is unsuitable for examining large numbers of samples at multiple dilutions, as is required when investigating a suspected outbreak of a notifiable disease. A method using microtitre cell cultures and immunoperoxidase staining was developed. This was evaluated by spiking normal porcine organ homogenates and serum with CSFV and measuring virus recovery. Virus was detected 24 hours after cell culture inoculation, with peak titres being reached in 48 hours. Virus concentrations recovered from spiked serum were almost as high as from control samples, but a hundredfold (2 log~o) loss of virus activity occurred in the spiked organ samples. The presence of intracellular lipid or lipoprotein inhibitors of measles, dengue, herpes simplex and rabies virus has been reported previously. It is possible that these substances are widespread in nature and adversely affect attempts at virus isolation. Breast carcinoma is a leading cause of death in women. Endometrial cancer is the commonest genital tract cancer with a lower mortality especially because it can be diagnosed at an earlier stage. Tamoxifen, a synthetic non-steroidal, anti oestrogenic drug is widely used as adjuvant therapy for breast cancer in post menopausal women with positive oestrogen receptors. Current trials are exploring the use of Tamoxifen as a prophylactic agent in women at high risk of developing breast cancer.",

Measurements of serum enzyme patterns are important diagnostic indicators of liver damage: enzyme measurements most commonly used in this way include alkaline phosphatase, alanine and aspartate aminotranferases and y-glutamyl transpeptidase. It has been suggested that glutathione Stransferase (GST) may be a better diagnostic enzyme for liver damage in a variety of clinical conditions. ~1) In this present study, we have studied the levels and isoenzyme patterns from groups of patients diagnosed as suffering from chronic active hepatitis (group 1, n=8), cholestasis (group 3, n=9) and cholestasis complicated by active cell damage (group 3, n=6) . Although the standard liver test enzymes are elevated in the second group, GST activity is within the reference interval for this enzyme (0.35U/mg, n\u2022 while significantly elevated in ihe other groups. Hepkit TM ELISA assays indicate that Alpha class GSTs are the predominant isoenzymes in these samples. Mu class isoenzymes were detected using a qualitative Mukit TM ELISA assay in 57% group and 25~ group 3 samples while no group 2 samples gave positive results for these enzymes. Alpha class GSTs were expressed in 100% group 1, 40% group 2 and 100% group 3. These results probably reflect GST polymorphisms in the human population. Based on these measurements, we suggest that low levels of GST, accompanied by elevation in the standard liver test enzymes may help to distinguish cholestasis from cholestasis complicated by active cell damage. Malignant Hyperthermia (MH) is a serious disorder, dominantly inherited, which results in muscle contracture and hyperthermia, provoked by volatile agents and muscle relaxants commonly used in anaesthesia. There are few reports of muscle biopsy findings in patients undergoing investigation for MH. Whether a specific \"MH myopathy\" recognisable by histological criteria exists remains uncertain. We studied muscle biopsies from 111 patients undergoing investigation for possible MH for histological/histochemical abnormalities~ Seventy eight biopsies were normal, 33 showed some myopathic features. When compared with results of muscle contraeture tests using caffeine and halothane, there was no direct relationship between contracture test results and histological findings. However, a higher incidence of myopathic features was found in MH probands i.e those who had experienced a clinical episode of hyperpyrexia, probably reflecting prior muscle damage. A few biopsies showed other muscle pathology e.g. mitochondrial myopathy, Thomsen's disease. Eight large kindreds within the group were studied in detail. Specific histological features tended to be found within individual families e.g mitochondrial excess, fibre type distribution patterns. The results suggest that there are no specific \"Malignant Hyperthermia Myopathy\" biopsy features, but that biopsy is often abnormal in probands and may be useful in indicating other muscle disease.

A prescribers' education programme emphasising use of frusemideamiloride reduced significantly H admissions within two years (p=<0.0001). This new situation indicates highly significant changes in DAH/non DAH admissions with H: most H admissions are not now related to diuretics; in DAH, frusemideamiloride admissions have higher K levels (3.2 vs 3.0mmol/1) and less morbidity from equal K levels; other drugs e.g. corticosteriods, bronchodilators are key precipitants in 62% of admissions with frusemide-amiloride DAH; admissions with frusemide-amiloride DAH are no longer caused by H alone. We conclude that frusemide-amiloride has led to beneficial chanqes in incidence and profile of DAH in hospital admissions.

Additional methods of continuous intervention are required to achieve long term effects. The General Medical Services (GMS) scheme provides medicines free of any charge to approximately 36% of our population. We looked at prescribing of ulcer-healing agents and analgesics between 1989 and 1993 to determine if the reintroduction in 1991 of alginates/antacids and certain analgesics had any impact on histamine H2 antagonist/omeprazole and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) prescribing respectively. Data was obtained from the GMS lists of top 100 drugs each year. Post re-instatement, alginates/antacids were used extensively -48,000 of 459,000 (10%) ulcer-healing items in 1991; 196,000 of 655,000 (30%) by 1993 -but histamine H2 antagonist prescribing continued to rise, implying no substitution occurred, and fell only in 1993 when prescribing incentives were introduced. Omeprazole use rose from 5,000 items in 1990 to 62,000 in 1993, possibly indicating consultant/hospital influence\"~. Prior to the re-introduction of paracetamol, its combinations and dextroproxyphene in 1991, the alternative analgesics were NSAID's, dihydrocodeine or morphine. NSAID's comprised 1.25m (85%) of 1.46m analgesic items dispensed in 1991 and rose to 1.3m items in 1992, before falling to 1.17m in 1993 (71% of 1.7m items). The less expensive reintroduced agents accounted for the rise in total analgesic use. Prescribing changes were temporally more related to introduction of budgetary incentives than to the re-introduction of therapeutic alternatives and prescribers appear to use such items in addition to, not instead of more expensive options until there is good incentive to change. Spontaneous reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADR's) by yellow cards is the most widely used surveillance system for the safety of drugs in clinical practice, however, fewer than 10% of ADR's are reported. We surveyed 240 hospital doctors and of 118 respondents, over half (54%) had never reported and of reporters, 49% had just one ADR. Just 20% of respondents knew all the NDAB reporting criteria. Seriousness of the reaction was the most important reason for reporting while unavailability of yellow cards was considered the most important deterrent. Having previously identified unavailability of yellow cards as a constraint to reporting ~1~, we made yellow cards prominently available in wards and clinics and for three months inserted one upon admission into patients' charts. Prescribers were reminded regularly of their availability. During the three months of interventionalactivity, the NDAB received 29 ADR reports from this hospital compared with 12 in the preceding three months. Cessation of visual and verbal reminding was followed by a drop to 14 reports in the next five months despite continued availability of yellow cards.",

The onset and progression of copper induced LDL oxidation was assessed by measuring the lag phase of production of conjugated dienes in an isolated LDL solution with continuous monitoring spectrophotometry at 234 nm through 4 hours. In patients on combined antihypertensive drug therapy, there was a significantly increased lag phase when compared with single antihypertensive drug treated patients (67.0 _+ 32.6 vs 46.6 _+ 9.9 minutes, mean _+ SD, p < 0.05) indicating the increased resistance of LDL to oxidation. Our data suggests that in hypertensive patients, there may be less oxidative damage and increased resistance to further damage in those on combined drug therapy. High activity of erythrocyte sodium-lithium countertransport (SLC) system is associated with essential hypertension. It is a genetically-determined trait and has been reported to be stable over prolonged periods in individuals. However, it is becoming increasingly evident that the transport system is susceptible to modulation, both acutely and chronically, by various factors. In this study, we observed temporal variatio0s in SLC over a period of ten hours (08.00 -18.00h) in healthy volunteers.",

Lung disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF). Lung destruction results from chronic pulmonary inflammation, characterised by a massive influx of neutrophils from the bloodstream. Recently, hyper-expression of the B2-integrin (CD18) adhesion molecules on circulating neutrophils has been observed in patients with Adult Respiratotf Distress Syndrome (ARDS). It is suggested that this may contribute to the excessive influx of neutrophils to the lung observed in ARDS. To assess whether similar mechanisms might be operating in CF, we compared su]'face expression of CD18 on circulating neutrophils from 10 CF patients and 10 control subjects of similar age and sex. Peripheral blood leukocytes were labelled With FITC-conjugated antibody to CD18 and analysed by flow cytometry. Results were calculated as the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD 18-labelled neutrophils. No difference in surface 82-integrin expression on circulating neutrophils between CF patients (MFI = 54.6\u2022 and control subjects (MFI = 57.2_+10.8) was observed. Only one CF patient displayed an MFI value above normal range (i.e. > mean control value + 2SD). Thus, in CF, over-expression of B2-integrins on circulating neutrophils does not seem to contribute to the excessive accumulation of neutrophils in the lung.

These results indicate that short-term treatment with nebulised DNase has little effect in attenuating underlying inflammation in CE This work was supported by the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland. Extrinisic allergic alveolitis (EAA) and sarcoidosis are two granulomatous lung diseases characterised by an expansion of lung T-cells. In active sarcoidosis an increase in CD4 relative to CD8 T-cells is seen, resulting in a raised CD4/CD8 ratio. In EAA the increase in both CD4 and CD8 T-cells is similar. Recent studies indicate that interleukin-4 can induce the transformation of CD4 to CD8 T-cells via a CD4+CDS+ intermediate. By assessing BAL samples from EAA and sarcoidosis patients for the presence of CD4+CD8+ T-cells, this study set out to examine whether a difference in the level of CD4 to CD8 transformation might contribute to the different pattern of T-cell expansion observed in these two diseases. BAL cells recovered from EAA (n=6) and sarcoidosis (n=28) patients were double labelled with fluorescent anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies and analysed by flow cytometry. Paired samples were labelled with anti-CD3 (pan T-cell) antibody and the percentage of CD3+ cells that were CD4+, CD8+ and CD4+CD8+ calculated. The percentage of CD4+CDS+ cells was found to be significantly higher in the EAA group compared to the sarcoidosis group (EAA = 9.1 \u2022 sarcoidosis = 2.0\u2022 p<0.005). These results suggest that differences in the level of transformation of CD4+ to CD8+ cells might indeed contribute to the differential T-cell expansion observed in EAA and sarcoidosis.

Video-assisted thoracic surgery appears to be a viable alternative to conventional thoracotomy when surgical management of spontaneous pneumothorax is required. Apical pleurectomy and bullectomy can be performed with this approach thus sparing the patient the morbidity associated with formal thoracotomy. Using video-assisted techniques, we have performed 140 procedures on 130 patients, between January 1992 and January 1995, including 33 patients with spontaneous pneumothorax. The male : female ratio was 1.4:1. Age ranged from 17 to 84 (mean 38.7). The tw O main therapeutic strategies were apical pleurectomy in all patients (33) and blebectomy/ bullectomy in 29 (88%). There was one hospital death (hospital mortality = 3%) in an elderly patient who developed multiorgan failure post bullectomy and persistent air leak. One patient (3%) required conversion to formal thoracotomy. Mean postoperative chest tube drainage was 3.1 days and mean postoperative hospital stay was 6.1 days. There has been no recurrence of pneumothorax in this series. Our evidence indicates an expanding role for video-assisted thoracic surgery which is now an option in the management of patients with spontaneous pneumothorax. Renal functional reserve (RFR) is the normal increase in renal blood flow (RBF) in response to a protein load, which may be diminished in severe COPD. We investigated this using Duplex Ultrasonography in 17 stable hypoxaernic COPD pts: and 5 mild COPD controls. Mean (SD) PaO2 was 8.2 (1.08), PaCO2 6.2 (0.71)kPa, FEVI 0.74 (0.27)1 in the hypoxaernics, and PaO2 10.8 (0.66), PaCO2 5.2 (0.3) and FEVI 1.55 (0.43)1 in controls. I0/17 pts. were hypercapnic. The pulsatility index (P1) (an index of RBF) was measured with an Acuson 128 scanner at baseline and 30, 75, 120 and 165 rains, after a 250g steak. The PI should decrease with increasing RBE Results: The PI fell normally in the controls, was unchanged in the normocapnic pts., and rose in hypercapnics. We conclude that there is evidence of sub-clinical renal impairment in pts. with severe COPD, which is more marked in hypercapnics. We investigated the immunopathological profile of the proximal airways in five patients (3 female, 2 male) who died from severe asthma. Blocks of tissue from the second generation right middle lobe bronchus were obtained within 24 hours of death and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Double immunofluoresence and immunoperoxidase techniques were performed using monoclonal antibodies directed against CD4, CD8, CD68, RFD1, RFD7, EG1 and EG2 surface markers. Frozen biopsy sections of human palatine tonsil served as positive controls. Each section had a negative control (buffered saline) and an irrelevant control (monoclonal antibody to B cells).

Spinal fusion was performed from T 1 to L4. lntra-operatively an intrathecal catheter was implanted, tunnelled and connected to a Medtronic implantable infusion pump. An intrathecal baclofen infusion was increased from an initial rate of 0.05 mg/24 hours to 0.8 mg/24 hrs. over a 5 day period.

Intubating conditions were significantly better (p<0.01) and anaesthetic time reduced (p<0.001) in the group who received suxamethonium. The incidence of myalgia was low in both groups (one patient in each group). This study shows that when suxamethonium is administered as part of a standard anaesthetic regimen, it does not appear to increase the frequency of POM in children. The use of suxamethonium optimises intubating conditions while reducing anaesthetic time. The incidence of suxamethonium myalgia in children is reported to be low ~, but has not been previously assessed in a randomised fashion. 70 children undergoing adenotonsillectomy were randomised to receive either deep inhalational anaesthesia with halothane (n=33), or suxamethonium lmg.kg-1 (n=37) for intubation following induction with thiopentone 6mg.kg-1. Variables recorded included intubating conditions, respiratory A High Dependency Unit (HDU) is defined as an area for patients that require more intensive observation, treatment and nursing care than can be provided on a general ward. The economics, the improved nurse/patient ratio and the rationalisation of intensive care utilisation justify the need for such a facility o~. In a 491 bedded hospital with a complement of 18 intensive care beds, we present a 4 month audit of a newly opened 8 bed HDU. We review the demands of the various specialities in terms of utilisation and percentage occupancy. The outcome of 85 consecutive patients (mean age 65.9+_11.7 years) with confirmed myocardial infarction was audited using a predictive instrument for mortality (t) Seventeen patients (20%) died within 6 weeks of admission: the predictive instrument predicted an overall mortality of 27.0_+23.5%. None of the 30 patients (35%) predicted to have a mortality below 12% died. Those who died did not present later than survivors (6.4+_5.9 vs. 6.1+-8.6 hours), but were older (75.4_+8.7 vs 63.5_+11.1 years, p <0 .001)~ Forty six patients (54.1%) were given thrombolytic therapy. These patients presented earlier (4.1 +/-3.6 vs. 8.5 +/-10.8 hours, p<0.02) and were younger (63.5_+10.7 vs. 68.6_+12.2 years, p<0.05) than the 39 patients not given thrombolytics. There was a mean delay of 83+-51 minutes between admission and thrombolytic administration. Only 3 of the 17 who died received thrombolytics. The actual mortality rate of those not given thrombolysis was 36% compared with a predicted rate of 33.9_+28.1%: both higher than th predicted (21.1_+16.5%, p<0.02) and actual (6.5%) mortality rate of those given thrombolytics. There may be a bias against giving thrombolytics to severely ill patients, since all 6 patients with shock were not treated. Of the rest not treated only 2 had an absolute contraindication; other reasons were: non-diagnostic ECG changes (12 patients), late presentation (3 patients), bleeding risk (5 patients), age (2 patients), hypertension (2 patients), no reason (7 patients). Conclusion: the predictive instrument identified those most likely to die from acute infarction and, hence, those most likely to benefit from thrombolysis.",

Diabetic retinopathy is a practised contraindication to thrombolysis in this hospital. Ptatelet aggregation and adhesion is mediated through glyc0protein (Gp)IIb/IIIa: an adhesion receptor The primary ligand is fibrinogen which binds via the sequence Arg-Gly-Asp(RGD). Hence RGD-containing peptides are antagonists at the receptor. However peptide antagonists induce an active conformation of the receptor and the appearance of novel epitopes: ligand induced binding sites(LIBS). The function of LIBS is unclear but they may be involved in cell activation and thus indicate partial agonist activity. We examined a novel nonpeptide GpIIb/[IIIa antagonist (NPA), which binds to the RGD recognition site, in 9 patients with stable angina. Platelet aggregation was assessed in response to thrombin related agonist peptide(TRAP) alone and in combination with collagen (agonist pathways unaffected by aspirin).

We have investigated the role of cyclooxygenase in the forearm vascular responses to serotonin in healthy volunteers. Ten healthy volunteers aged 25-36 years were studied.

Acetylcholine is now known to stimulate muscarinic receptors on the endothelial cell surface, resulting in production of nitric oxide. Local infusion of acetylcholine and measurement of vascular response is now a widely used technique for assessing the function of the vascular endothelium in vivo. L-NMMA, a stereospecific inhibitor of nitric oxide, has been found to only partially inhibit vasodilation to acetylcholine~2L This suggests that another vasodilator substance such as a cyclooxygenase product may be involved. Ten healthy volunteers (age 49-57 years) underwent brachial artery cannulation. Forearm blood flow was measured at baseline and following local drug infusions using venous occlusion plethysmography. Acetylcholune was infused at 60, 120, 180 and 240 nmo/min for 2 minutes each. Indomethacin (100) mg was then administered orally and after a period of 90 minutes the infusions were repeated. Results were analysed using paired t-tests and Dunnett's test of multiple comparisons. Acetylcholine caused a dose-dependent increase in blood flow. There was no significant change in basal or stimulated flow following indomethacin. In conclusion, cyclooxygenase products do not influence forearm vascular responses to acetylcholune in healthy volunteers.

At each of the 64 electrode sites QRS and ST-T iso-integrals, and 11 other features of the QRST segment are measured. In addition new variables are derived which describe the 3-dimensional geometric surface of the map. Using a training set of maps recorded on 80 controls and 69 patients with MI, 14 variables were identified which correctly classified 79/80 of the controls (specificity = 98.8%) and 65/69 of the MIs (sensitivity = 94.2%). The algorithm based on these 14 variables was applied prospectively to a further 48 control subjects and 59 patients with MI (10 anterior, 31 inferior, 13 inferoposterior, 2 posterior, 1 lateral, 1 inferior with right bundle branch block and 1 anterior non-Q wave MI). All 48 control subjects (specificity = 100%) and 57/59 of the MIs (sensitivity = 96.6%) were correctly classified. This algorithm demonstrates a high level of sensitivity and specificity for the early detection of MI.

The two examinations were performed within a few days of each other in all cases. Angiographic stenosis measurements were recorded in each patient using a digital subtraction technique and dedicated equipment. Measurements were similarly obtained using duplex ultrasound scanning and colour flow mapping. Measurements obtained from the 103 patients were placed in recognised groups of severity. In 93% of cases arteries demonstrated to be sonographically normal were confirmed normal on angiography. However, in patients with higher grade sten0ses (greater than 70%) agreement was rather less at 79%. Overall agreement between the two modalities occurred in 71% of cases. Conclusion: We have demonstrated that duplex sonography can reliably identify normal and minimally diseased vessels. However, in higher grade stenoses we would recommend the greater sensitivity of angiography as a standard part of the imaging protocol. 154 consecutive patients completed a questionnaire stating why and for how long they expected to take warfarin and if they were aware of certain problems with long term anticoagulation. The clinic doctor then correlated this with the information on each patient's anticoagulant card, which should include indication for anticoagulation, target International Normalised Ratio (INR) and expected duration of treatment. The indication for anticoagulation was stated on the card in 84% of cases, known by 68% of patients and unknown in 5%. These indications included valvular heart disease and atrial fibrillation (70%) and complications of ischaemic heart disease (15%). The expected duration of treatment was given on the card in 44% and known by the patient in 59%. It was assumed to be lifelong in a further 15% as the indication in these cases was valve replacement. The INR target range was stated in only 17% of cases. Patients indicated that they were aware of the potential for drug interactions and the possibility of bleeding after surgery or dental work in 48%, 40% and 49% of cases respectively. This audit reveals shortcomings in the completion of anticoagulant cards with basic details such as duration and target anticoagulation range often omitted. The study also revealed that continuing patient education is needed as knowledge of long term risks of anticoagulation was poor. +Project Co-ordinator",

The ultimate objective of this project is to produce a functional model of a miniaturized Total Chemical Analysis System (/aTAS) suitable for application in real-time monitoring of clinically important analytes particularly lactate and glucose. Equipment miniaturization would increase speed of analysis and reduce consumption of reagents which may be epensive and harmful to the environment. Details on two aspects of the project will be presented -1) the improved performance obtained with amperometric enzyme membrane electrodes using Lactate Oidase/Glucose Oxidase Sandwich membranes in combination with flow injection analysis (FIA). The linear lactate concentration increased from 1.5mM to 20mM by combination with EA using a volume injection of 25.1al. 2) the fabrication and performance parametrs of integrated thin film lactate and glucose sensors. The relative effects of potential interferents in clinical application were studied and show that ascorbic acid and uric acid interference is negligible. Paracetamol at a concentration 10 times the therapeutic concentration causes a reading error less than 0.5mM/L for glucose. Probes for continuous monitoring of blood pressure, temperature and oxygen status of blood in the critical care of patients have been developed. The application on a total chemical analysis system for continuous monitoring of analytes is under development. The sample for analysis could be withdrawn through a microdialysis probe inserted subcutaneously or directly in blood. Microdialysis is a diffusion based method by which small molecules can be removed from living tissue for analysis. The sample obtained is free from macromolecules (mainly proteins) and may be introduced directly into microanalytical systems without further purification. The aims of this presentation are to report the effects of perfusion flow rate, temperature and dialysis membrane size on microdialysis efficiency as judged by relative recovery of lactate and glucose in in-vitro studies. Relative recovery of lactate and glucose decreased from 93% to 10% as perfusion flow rate increased from 1.5 to 20pl/min. Dialysis efficiency was not significantly altered by temperature change within the physiological range -effciency altered by 0.33% and 0.54% per degree Celsius for lactate and glucose respectively in in-vitro experiments. The relative recovery of lactate increased from 10% to 100% as microdialysis membrane surface area increased from 10mm 2 to 80mm 2.

Shibutani has suggested that the critical level of oxygen delivery (Crit DO2) in cardiac surgery is 300-00 ml/min/m2. Dopexamine improves oxygen delivery. This study prospectively analysed the effect of prophylactic dopexamine on oxygen delivery in low risk patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. 23 consenting elective patients without ventricular dysfunction were enrolled in a double blind, placebo-controlled study. They received either a prophylactic infusion of dopexarnine at 2ug/kg/min (N--12) or saline (N=ll). Serial oxygen delivery (D02) and oxygen consumption (VO2) were measured at 12 pre-determined intervals. Crit DO2 was calculated using split linear regression~analysis from grouped measurements in early (0-5 hr) post operative and late (6-24 hr) post-operative periods. The number of DO2s in each group falling below the Crit DO2 were compared.",

Routine supplementation of trace elements is common in patients receiving total parenteral nutrition. This practice may be both unnecessary and unsafe. For many trace elements, only severe prolonged deficiency will lead to clinical symptoms 1. On the other hand, routine supplementation may give rise to toxic effects. The proprietary preparaffon Addamel| has been discontinued following reports of Manganese toxicity. As Manganese is excreted primarily in the bile, this is most likely to occur in patients with cholestasis 2. Monitoring of serum Manganese levels is an attractive option but may be impractical because of long delays in obtaining results. For these reasons, it has been our practice not to give Addamel| or Additrace| to patients receiving short term parenteral nutrition (less than 2 weeks). We do, however, give Zinc to all patients as Zinc deficiency is common in the critically ilP. We have reviewed the nutrition records of 227 patients. 38 patients (34%) received Addamel| and 78 patients (17%) recelved Additrace| but only after 2 weeks of feeding. This was not associated with adverse effects. In contrast, 212 patients (93%) received Zinc (average 303 lamol daily). We conclude that routine Manganese supplementation is unnecessary during short term parenteral nutrition. Vascular overproduction of the vasodilator nitric oxide (NO) causes pathological vasodilatation in endotoxic shock (ES). Thus NO synthase inhibitors including NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) have been administered to endotoxaemic patients. This treatment restores blood pressure but reduces cardiac output (CO). In healthy pigs we have shown that CO is restored by the selective arterial vasodilator nicardipine indicating that reduced CO is due to increased afterload. To establish whether these findings could be applied to an appropriate pathological situation, we aimed to optimise an existing porcine model of ES and to assess the effects of L-NAME and of subsequent vasodilatation with nicardipine on CO in this model. In three groups of six pigs ES was induced by administration of E. coli lipopolysaccharide endotoxin (LPS 160 lag kg 1 as a 30 minute infusion) with concomitantly inhaled NO to attenuate pulmonary vasoconstriction and intravenous fluids to maintain preload. Systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances (SVR, PVR) and CO (thermodilution) were measured at 30 minute intervals. This protocol produced an appropriate model of ES 60 minutes after the start of the LPS infusion (SVR 96 to 53 kPa 1 -~ sec; PVR 14 to 15 kPa 1-1 scc; CO 6.5 to 8.51 minl). In two groups L-NAME (5 mg kg q between 75 and 85 minutes after the start of LPS infusion) increased SVR (to 111 kPa 1 -~ sec) but increased PVR (to 32 kPa 1-1 sec and reduced CO (to 6.21 min-1). One of these groups subsequently received nicardipine (50 lag kg ~ between 135 and 145 minutes) which reduced SVR (to 69 kPa 1 j sec) and PVR (to 26 kPa 1-1 sec), temporarily restoring CO (to 6.61 rain-l). It may be possible to coadminister vasoconstrictors and vasodilators in ES in doses titrated to restore SVR without increasing PVR or reducing CO. Hepatitis C infection (HCV) has been suggested as a triggering factor for porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). Patients with PCT have been found to have a hundred fold increase in HCV antibody prevalence compared with blood donors, ranging from 10% of PCT patients in Ireland to 79% in Spain. There are at least four patients in Ireland who have been diagnosed with both HCV and PCT. In addition, HIV infection has also been associated with significantly abnormal porphyrin metabolism. However, the role of HCV infection alone in precipitating PCT is unclear. We therefore studied porphyrin metabolism in 2 groups of patients with HCV infection.",

Hepatitis C infection alone is not sufficient to cause PCT. Additional co-factors such as genetic susceptibility, iron overload, alcohol abuse and oestrogen therapy appear necessary for induction of PCT, as all 4 patients with PCT had such additional risk factors. The natural history of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is unaffected by standard chemotherapy. Treatment with interferon-or produces cytogenetic remission in only a few patients. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is curative, but only a small minority of patients are suitable because of age or lack of donors. For these reasons, attention ha s recently focussed on autologous transplantatio n. Although the bone marrow of patients with CML appears 100% Philadelphia chromosome (Ph') positive, there is evidence that patients have some residual Ph'-negative progenitors. Carella and others have selectively harvested these cells after myelosuppressive chemotherapy. We have mobilised peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) from 7 patients with CML in first chronic phase with idarubicin 8 mg/m 2 on days 1 and 2 and cytosine arabinoside 200 mg/m 2 bd on days 1-5 followed by G-CSF until the end of PBPC harvesting. Short term cultures indicated an adequate yield of PBPC in 517 patients. In 316 evaluable patients PBPC were predominantly Ph'-negative (5/90, 2/60, 2/90 metaphases Ph' positive). One patient has been given high-dose chemotherapy and a PBPC infusion and has engrafted well with predominantly Ph'-negative haemopoiesis. We conclude that Ph' negative PBSC can be mobilised from patients in first chronic phase CML. Serotonin produces a biphasic response in the forearm vascular resistance bed of healthy volunteers, vasodilatation occurring at low dose and vasoconstriction at high dose. In vitro studies have shown that the vascular relation to serotonin is endothelium-dependent 01. Age-related impairment of flow mediatedendothelium-dependent vasodilatation in the human forearm circulation has recently been reportedt2L We have studied forearm arteriolar responses to serotonin in young and older non-smoking healthy volunteers. Nine young subjects (age range 25-32 years) and eight older subjects (age range 48-63 years) underwent cannulation of the brachial artery for the local infusion of drugs. Forearm blood flow was measured at baseline and following each drug infusion using venous occlusion plethysmography. Serotonin was infused in 5 incremental doses 0.003-30 lag/min for 2 minutes each. Results were expressed as change in forearm blood flow (ml/100ml/min) and analysed using multivariate analysis of variance and Dunnett's test of multiple comparisons. Serotonin produced a biphasic response in both groups with vasodilatation occurring at low doses and vasoconstriction at the highest dose (fig 1) .

University Department of Surgery, St. James's Hospital, Dublin. Reflux into the proximal oesophagus may be associated with extra-oesophageal manifestations of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. This study examined the correlation between distal oesophageal acid exposure refluxate pH, clearance of refluxate, oesophageal motility and proximal oesophageal reflux. Oesophageal manometry and 24 hour dual channel pH monitoring were performed in 105 patients; group I (n=42) normal controls; group 2 (n=33) distal GORD; group 3 (nhad greater oesophageal wave amplitude and lower sphincter pressures. Characteristics of distal reflux did not predict proximal oesophageal acid exposure. The pathophysiology of proximal reflux remains unclear.

(P.35) ANTIBODY CROSS-REACTIONS BETWEEN GANGLIOSIDES AND LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDES OF CAMP YLO BA CTER JEJUNI A. E Moran*, A. Neisser, R. J. Polt, H. Bernheimer, M. Kainz, B. Schwerer. *Department of Microbiology, University College, Galway, and Obersteiner Institut, University of Vienna. Guillain-Barr6 syndrome (GBS), an inflammatory demyelinating autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system, is frequently associated with serum antibodies against gangliosides. GBS often develops after enteric infection with certain serotypes of Campylobacterjejuni (0:2, 0:4 and 0:19). Mimicry by ganglioside-like structures in lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of C.jejuni has been suggested to link infection, antiganglioside antibodies and development of GBS. The purpose of this study was to investigate the cross-reactions of antibodies with gangliosides and C.jejuni LPS. Binding studies were performed using thin-layer chromatography with chemical-and immuno-staining. Binding of anti-GM1 antibodies to 0:19 LPS, and of anti-asialoGM1 antibodies to 0\" 19 LPS, but predominantly to 0:2 LPS, was observed. Anti-C.jejuni 0:19 antiserum bound GMl and asialoGMl, whereas 0:4 antiserum did not bind these gangliosides. Sera from two GBS patients who had C.jejuni infection contained antibodies predominantly of the IgA class against GM1, asialoGMl, and GDlb, as well as against 0:2, 0:4, and 0:19 LPS. Ganglioside-like epitopes in C.jejuni LPS, and the predominance of IgA in both patients, support the possibility that immune reactions against C.jejuni contribute to GBS.

Endocrine Laboratory, Departments of Medicine & Surgery,University College Dublin. Cytochemical measurement of Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity is routinely performed under an atmosphere of N 2 to prevent H \u00a7 reacting preferentially with 02 and thus being unavailable to reduce a neotetrazolium (NT) H+ acceptor. G6PD activity was minimal when benign tissues were reacted under an atmosphere of 02 . An unexplained finding was that in many malignant tissues a significant amount of G6PD activity is retained under 02. In this study G6PD measured in frozen sections from benign thyroid tissues (N=14) gave a mean of 33.4_+0.7U under 02. In contrast, malignant thyroid tissues (N=6) demonstrated O 2 insensitivity in that significant G6PD activity was retained under 02 (N 2 39.2_+1.0U; 02 37A_+l.0U; 95% G6PD activity retained). O 2 insensitivity in malignant tissues has been attributed to the inability of such tissue to remove superoxide radicals. Frozen sections of thyroid tissue were incubated with the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD; 42-4201U/ml) prior to G6PD measurement. Addition of SOD abolished the 02 insensitivity of G6PD in the malignant thyroid rendering its behaviour similar to benign tissues which were themselves unaffected by exogenous SOD. of malignant to metabolise 02 radicals and demonstrate that this investigation is a true metabolic index differentiating between benign and malignant thyroid tissues.(E136) OESTROGEN AND PROGESTERONE RECEPTORS IN TAMOXIFEN ASSOCIATED ENDOMETRIAL LESIONS S.

Department of Clinical Cardiology, Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Eccles Street, Dublin 7.To establish current clinical practice in the care of patients with acute myocardial (AMI), a questionnaire survey of 50 consultant physicians was performed. There were 42 (84%) responders.All use aspirin in the acute setting. 38/42 (90%) give thrombolysis in CCU only; 4/42 give thrombolysis in casualty also. 36/42 (86%) use streptokinase only, regardless of patient age or site of AMI. 6/42 (14%) use TPA for anterior AMI in patients under 60. ACE inhibitors are given by 34/42 (81%) in patients with anterior AMI and evidence of LV dysfunction. ACE inhibitors are neither given routinely nor given before day 3 by any physician surveyed. Magnesium is checked routinely by 8/42 (19%) and given routinely by none. The percentage of AMTs considered for angiography in the individual physician's units varied from 10-50%.Conclusion: Despite the recent depth of literature supporting the use of TPA, early ACE inhibition and magnesium in the treatment of AMI, current practice predominantly is streptokinase~ selective late ACE inhibition and no magnesium. The reasons for the dichotomy between the favourable results of randomised trials of therapy in AMI and clinical practice are unknown.(P.182) DIABETES, RETINOPATHY AND THROMBOLYSIS A. Scallon, M.

Murphy.Departments of Gastroenterology and Dermatology, Beaumont Hospital; Department of Biochemistry, St. James's Hospital, Dublin. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been implicated as a possible triggering factor for porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) with antibody prevalence ranging from 10% in Ireland to 76% in France. We therefore compared porphyrin metabolism in 2 groups of patients with HCV infection.Group 1 comprised 34 Rhesus negative women immunised with anti-D immunoglobulin (age range 30-56, mean 44 yrs). Group 2, all HIV negative intravenous drug abusers (IVDA), included 14 male, 11 female (age range 16-43, mean 28 yrs) HCV positive patients (Elisa and RIBA 3). Haemoglobin, serum ferritin, liver function tests, Hepatitis A and B status, plasma and urinary porphyriias were measured. One patient in Group 1 was on oestrogen therapy. Three in Group 2 abused alcohol.Porphyrin excretion was normal apart from 3 (12%) in Group 2 with elevated free erythrocyte protoporphyrin, ranging from 756-969 ng/L (normal<590). Liver function tests were abnormal in 27 (76.4%) in Group 1 and 19 (76%) in Group 2. Ferritin levels were elevated in 2 (5.9%) at 267ng/mL and 671ng/mL (normal: 8-110)in Group 1 alone.HIV and HCV infection are associated with significantly abnormal porphyrin metabolism. Four of 59 patients with HCV infection alone, had mildly abnormal porphyrin profiles. Other factors, including, p r o g r e s s i v e liver disease, genetic predisposition, older age, ethanol, iron overload and oestrogen therapy may be necessary to precipitate overt PCT.(P.19) MALIGNANT MELANOMA -THE CASE FOR EARLY DIAGNOSIS A.

The phase of the menstrual cycle was confirmed histologically. The PF was collected from the Pouch of Douglas at laparoscopy and kept frozen until analysed. Vitamin E was estimated using HPLC methods and PGs were measured by the radioimmunoassay techniques. The values given are mg/L (mean _+ SEM). Women with MSE had vitamin E levels of 3.67 _+ 0.43 compared with values of 4.87 _+ 0.88 in the normal group (p<0.05). Peritoneal fluid vitamin E showed a significant negative correlation with its PGFz~ content in women with a normal pelvis (r=0.69; p<0.01) but not in women with MSE (r=0.26; p>0.05). In contrast the levels of vitamin E in the PF of normal women showed a positive correlation with its PGE z content (r=0.62; p<0.02) but not in women with MSE (r=0.30; p>0.05). From these results it appears that vitamin E plays an essential role in the synthesis and/or metabolism of ovarian PGs in the luteal phase and this function is abnormal in women with MSE.

Following reperfusion, urinary TXM increased in the RO43-5054 group to 31 +9ng/ml (n=4), similar to controls. This increase was blunted in the RO44-9883 treated group (9+2.5ng/ml, n=4). Hence, GPIIb/IIIa antagonists that do not induce LIB S result in greater suppression of platelet activation in vivo, although without any discernable functional benefit in this model. The persistent generation of TXA2 with LIBSexpressing antagonists, suggests that such antagonists have partial agonist activity.had coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG] for isolated disease of the LAD, and to assess their 4-10 year clinical outcome. Patients were identified from the operative records of all hospitals performing cardiac surgery in Ireland from[1984][1985][1986][1987][1988][1989][1990]. Cine coronary arteriograms and clinical case notes from the time of operation were reviewed. Follow up on 283 patients was by postal questionnaire or telephone interview and was complete in 100%.The left internal mammary artery was used as a conduit in 246 patients[87%]. Median duration of follow up was 6.6 years. Survival was excellent, being 97% at 5 years and 86% at I0 years.At time of follow up, 263 [93%] of patients were alive, 195 [69%] were free of angina, 17 [6%] had a myocardial infarction and 32 [11%] had cardiac failure. Repeat cardiac surgery was required in 15 patients [5%], with 1 having cardiac transplantation. Conclusion. Patients undergoing CABG for isolated LAD disease have an excellent prognosis. Where possible internal mammary artery grafts were used. (E189) THE LEARNING CURVE FOR NEW CORONARY DEVICES T. Hennessy, H. McCann, D. Sugrue. Department of Clinical Cardiology, Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Dublin 7.Since 1990, percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedures have been performed in 82 patients using new coronary devices (stents --70, atherectomy = 12). We compared the major complication rate of patients undergoing new device intervention with patients undergoing conventional PTCA during this time. All stented patients were aggressively anticoagulated (Aspirin, intravenous heparin until INR > 3, Warfarin for 1-3 months). Results are tabulated below. No patient required blood transfusion or dropped haemoglobin > 2g/dl. Conclusion: the requirement for emergency CABG was greater in the \"new device group\". Otherwise new device PTCA at our institution had a low major complication rate. In particular the the of vascular repair (2.4%) and absence of significant haemorrhage is encouraging.(E191) IMPACT OF CIGARETTE SMOKING ON OUTCOME POST BYPASS SURGERY FOR ISOLATED LAD STENOSIS T. Hennessy, M. Codd, S. Donnelly, A. Hennessy, C. Hartigan, H. McCann, D. Sugrue Departments of Clinical Cardiology, Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Dublin.Cigarette smoking predicts an adverse outcome following coronary artery bypass grafting[CABG]. The purpose of this study was to detail the effect of smoking on a highly select group of patients who had CABG for single vessel left anterior descending [LAD] coronary artery disease. Patients were identified from the operative records of all hospitals performing cardiac surgery in Ireland from 1984-1990. Follow up on 283 patients was by postal questionnaire or telephone interview and was complete in 100%The vital status and clinical events for all patients relating to their smoking history are tabulated below Conclusion: Of patients with single vessel LAD disease having CABG, 12.7% continued to smoke. While continuers were less likely to suffer from angina to quitters, they were more likely to die, have a myocardial infarction [MI], suffer from cardiac failure [CCF], or require redo CABG.(P.190) LONG TERM OUTCOME FOLLOWING CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING FOR ISOLATED LAD STENOSIS T.

Blake, H. McCann, D. Sugrue. Department of Clinical Cardiology, Mater Misericordiae Hospital and National Maternity Hospital, Dublin. The direction and magnitude of change in cardiac output (CO) during the third trimester remains controversial. This Vol. 164, 1995 Supplement No. 14 Irish Journal of Medical Sciencecontroversy is founded in part on the small numbers studied and the methodological difficulties in obtaining reproducible measurements of CO non-invasively. Doppler flow velocity profiles and aortic root cross sectional area measurements using transthoracic ultrasound are an accurate and reproducible method for non-invasive measurement of CO. We performed serial measurements of CO on 5 occasions from 24 weeks gestation to term and once during the puerperium in 26 normal pregnancies (156 measurements in total). Absolute values & % change from baseline.Conclusions: In this study, CO increased in a linear fashion until the end of pregnancy. Thereafter, it reached a plateau and ultimately declined before term, though not to baseline. These observations have management implications for patients with serious heart disease complicating pregnancy.(P.193) VALUE AND LIMITATIONS OF DOBUTAMINE STRESS ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY IN THE DETECTION OF CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE T.

            "text": "The pathogenesis of coeliac disease appears to involve an immunological response to the ingestion of specific cereal proteins in wheat, barley and rye. The issue of oats toxicity is controversial and was investigated in this study. 9 biopsy-proven coeliac patients in clinical and histological remission were challenged with 50g of oats daily for a 3 month period. Clinical, laboratory, histological and immunological markers of coeliac disease activation were evaluated. All patients remained asymptomatic throughout the challenge period and no laboratory evidence of malabsorption was found. There was no mucosal damage seen on routine histological examinaton of post challenge duodenal biopsies. Surface enterocyte height remained unchanged and intraepithelial lymphocyte counts were also unaltered following challenge. Furthermore, oats did not cause immunological activation since no rise in alpha gliadin or endomysial antibodies or in MHC class II staining of enterocytes was evident. This study demonstrates that oats is neither toxic nor immunogenic in coeliac disease and oats does not appear to contain the putative toxic peptide sequence found in the 3 other cereals. We examined postprandial endogenous cellular cholesterol synthesis in obese subjects before and after enrolling in a weight reducing program. 9 obese insulin resistant subjects were studied for 7_+2months. Blood was drawn fasting, at 30 minutes and at 4 hours after consuming a carbohydrate rich meal. Lymphocytes were isolated and incubated with ~4C acetate to measure de novo cholesterol synthesis. Insulin resistance was determined from the fasting insulin to glucose ratio while the ratio of the change in insulin from 0 to 30 minutes to the change in glucose over the same time yielded a index of insulin secretion. Weight and BMI fell from 101.6+9.6 to 92.7-+8kg{p<0.001 } and from 37.5_+2.9 to 34.4_+2.4kg/m 2 {p<0.001 } respectively. Fasting lipids did not change. There was a decrease in insulin resistance from 3.04+1 to 2.0-+0.6 (p=n/s} and in insulin secretion from 31.3_+10.1 to 20.3-+8 {p<0.05}. At baseline there was a rise in cholesterol synthesis postprandially from 362.1_+73.2 to 502.6-+124.4 pg/mg cell protein {p<0.05 } but after weight loss",
