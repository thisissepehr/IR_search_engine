Retroperitoneally located pancreas and duodenum injury with or without liver injury occur rarely but they are seriously life threatening injuries. For these reasons we aimed to investigate the traumatic liver, duodenum and pancreas injuries as a whole. Materials and methods: 55 cases of blunt and penetrating traumas occured in our district are included in this study. In these patients parameters of sex, age, etiology, admission time, stability and physical status on admission, concurrent organ injury, operation type, gradings of injuries, were investigated. Results: 51cases (92,7%) suffered from liver injury, while 4 cases (7,3%) suffered from hepaticopancreaticoduodenal injury. 31 cases (56%) were caused by penetrating injuries. 31 cases of liver injury group had isolated liver injury whereas 15 cases of the group has additional thoracic injury, 3 cases had great vessel injury, 1 case had orthopedic injury and lastly 1 case had head injury in addition to the liver injury. In the combined hepatic injury group mortality rate was 7,3%. Conclusions 1. In hepatoduodenopancreatic injury group blunt and penetrating injury rates are equal. 2. Duodenum-pancreas injuries occur rarely. Liver,with injury rates of 51 cases in this study, is the most frequently injured organ. 3.

This was achieved by reviewing our experience as a Major Victorian Trauma Service in the management of bowel and mesenteric injuries and how this compares to current literature. Methods: A retrospective study reviewing 278 consecutive patients who presented to the Alfred trauma centre with blunt bowel and mesenteric injuries over 6 years. Results: Of the 278 patients with BBMI 66% were male, 34% were female. 80% of the patients underwent a laparotomy, 17% of patients were treated conservatively and 3% were diagnosed post-mortem. The times from admission to laparotomy were: 0-4 h 67%, 4-8 h 9%, 8-12 h 3%, 12-24 h 10%, 24-48 h 4%, more than 48 h 7%, respectively. FAST (focused abdominal sonography for trauma) was done in 86 and 51% of this group had a positive FAST. While 44% of patients had a negative FAST and 4% of patients had an equivocal FAST. 13% overall group did not have a FAST. Computerised tomography (CT) scans were undertaken preoperatively in 68% of the patients and showed: free gas (22%), bowel wall thickening (31%), fat and mesenteric stranding or Hematoma (38%) and free fluid with no solid organ injury (43%).

Patients were identified at the Severe Trauma Registry of our hospital, between 1993 and 2006. Results: We found 105 (16,6%) GIMI out of 632 patients with abdominal trauma, in a Registry with 1.495 severe trauma cases included. The mean ISS and NISS were of 20 and 25, respectively. Mortality was of 9 (8,5%) patients, 4 of them unexpected. A CT scan was performed in 56 (53%) cases, and only in 37 were there signs suggestive of a GIMI. Surgery was delayed for more than 8 h in 21 (20%) patients, the most common reason being a false negative result in the CT scan. There was no significant increase of morbidity or mortality in the delayed diagnosis group. Conclusion: The overall incidence of GIMI was high in our Registry (31% in penetrating and 10.7% in blunt trauma). Several factors such as the initial lack of symptoms, a low diagnostic sensitivity of the CT (34% false negatives), and the nonoperative management of solid organ injuries, have contributed to a delayed diagnosis in one of every five patients in our series, but this has not led to a significant increase in septic complications in this group. Author to editor: CT scan diagnosis of gastrointestinal injuries continues to be a matter of concern. There is controversy on the clinical significance of a delayed diagnosis of small bowel injuries 10 Management of Rectal Injury: Reappraisal of Old Techniques Introduction and objectives: Due to immunological functions, conservation of injured spleen following abdominal trauma is very important. For this reason nonoperative management (NOM) in the last 25 years has been accepted as the ideal treatment in those patents who are hemodynamically stable and do not require a laparotomy; however in case of multiple abdominal solid organ injuries (SOI) NOM is controversial. Methods: We report on a case of a 27-years-old patient with spleen and renal injury subsequent to blunt abdominal trauma. CT scan revealed a OIS IV injury (Third degree in Graz classification) and an OIS IV renal injury. Since chances for successful spleen angioembolization were judged poor by radiologist, a laparotomy and partial spleen resection with preservation of one-third of the spleen was performed. Immediately after surgery, angioembolization of the renal injury was successfully performed. Results: A contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) performed on day 7 and day 30 after trauma revealed a hypertrophy of the residual spleen with diffuse distribution of contrast agent in the spleen parenchyma, confirming functional activity of the organ. Morphological and functional evolution of left kidney was normal.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Conclusions: Sequential treatment (surgical preservation of the most injured organ followed by immediate angiographic embolization) could be a valid option in case of multiple abdominal SOI; furthermore, CEUS is an interesting new tool to determine functional activity of residual spleen. Introduction: Precise timing of cholecystectomy procedure after biliary pancreatitis is still controversial. The major drawback of interval cholecystectomy is the recurrence of pancreatitis within the interval of 6-8 weeks. Early cholecystectomy (performed prior to discharge), however, have the disadvantages of increased technical difficulty and conversion rates. Methods: We reviewed 47 patients with recurrent biliary pancreatitis among a total number of 277 cases of biliary pancreatitis in-between January 2007 and January 2009. Results: The mean age was 64.5 (range 29-85), and male-to-female ratio was 0.4 (13:34). Seventeen patients (%36) had a history of previous cholecystectomy. Of these 17 patients, 8 (%17) have had early cholecystectomy, and 9 (%19) have had interval cholecystectomy. The rest of the patients (%64, n = 30) consists of those who have been scheduled for interval cholecystectomy but have had a recurrent episode during the 8-week interval (%6, n = 3) or after the 8-week interval (%57, n = 27). Conclusion: The majority of patients with biliary pancreatitis do not have any recurrent episodes even if they do not have a surgical or an endoscopic treatment. According to our data, however, an influenced percentage of recurrent pancreatitis develops in patients who do not have early cholecystectomy. Therefore, we prefer early cholecystectomy in means of reducing the risk of recurrent pancreatitis during or after the 8-week interval.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Introduction and aim: Nonoperative management (NOM) of splenic injury is currently the most common management strategy in hemodynamically stable trauma patients.

Introduction: It was the aim of the study to analyze the potential value of microdialysis in the rectus abdominis muscle (RAM) compared with conventional monitoring parameters currently in clinical use for the detection of the abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). Methods: 30 pigs were anaesthesized, mechanically ventilated and continuously monitored. Microdialysis was performed in different abdominal organs, the RAM and cervical muscle (distant reference) for glucose, lactate, lactate-pyruvate ratio (LPR) and glycerol. IAH was maintained for 6 h. Three groups were analysed: control (A), IAH 20 mmHg (B) and 30 mmHg (C).Cardiopulmonary parameters, urinary output, blood gas analysis and venous lactate were recorded.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Results: Mean arterial pressure and abdominal perfusion pressure remained above clinically defined thresholds during the experiments for groups A and B.

In contrast, microdialysis revealed a significant increase of LPR in all monitored organs in groups B and C, indicating ischemia and energy failure. Of interest, LPR in the RAM showed a significant increase already after 2 h of IAH in group B.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Conclusion: Microdialysis of the RAM detected local metabolic derangements in animals with IAH of 20 mmHg while clinically established monitoring tools failed to show organ dysfunction/tissue ischemia.

Introduction: To avoid morbidity associated with open abdomen, subcutaneous linea alba fasciotomy (SLAF) was introduced for management of abdominal compartment syndrome (ACP) in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). We analyzed the efficacy and safety of SLAF as a surgical decompressive technique. Methods: A retrospective study of a 3-year period identified 10 patients with SAP and ACS undergoing SLAF. Mean age was 46 (range 33-61) years, 9 were male and 9 had alcohol-induced SAP. SLAF was performed 1-17 days post-admission, in 6/10 cases within 48 h. Results: The mean (range) preoperative intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) was 31 (23-45) mmHg and immediate postoperative IAP 20 (10-33) mmHg. The mean decrease was 10 (2-17) mmHg and the decompressive effect was considered sufficient in 7/10 cases. Two of these developed recurrent ACS and required completion laparotomy, as did the 3 with insufficient effect (0-3 days post-SLAF). The mean preoperative SOFA score was 12 (4-17) and 11 (1-20) 1-5 days postoperatively, the decrease was > 5 in 3 patients with successful SLAF. Eventually four patients underwent necrosectomy, two following sufficient SLAF. The overall mortality and morbidity rates were 4/10 and 3/10, no complications were attributed to SLAF itself. Mean hospital stay was 35 (11-70) days. Of the survivors, fascial closure was achieved in two, and planned hernia in four (two with split-thickness skin graft and two with post-SLAF hernia).

Missed final diagnosis were: Acute cholecystitis (10), acute appendicitis (10), missed fractures (8), pneumothorax (2) liver mass (2), urethral stone (2), ectopic pregnancy (1), diverticulitis (1), subarachnoid bleeding (1), others (9). Conclusions: Acute cholecystitis, acute appendicitis, and missed fractures were the most frequent surgical causes of URs after emergency department discharges. Liberal utilization of abdominal sonography and abdominal CT scan may reduce missed acute abdomen in abdominal pain patients and appropriate radiological imaging and meticulous evaluation of the X-rays may reduce unnoticed spinal, pelvic and facial fractures in trauma patients. Editor to self: Se\u00e7ilmi\u015f bildiri olabilir Introduction and aim: Bacteremia sepsis and septic shock might develop rapidly for the patients with infection in bile path. Early diagnosis, surgical treatment and antibiotherapy decrease mortality. In this study, the relation between choledocholithiasis, cholangitis and pancreatitis and treatment methods have been evaluated. Method: The demographic features, the treatments, the intensity of the illness and mortality rate of the 155 patients in Afyon Kocatepe University General Surgery clinic between the years 2006 Background: Enterocutaneous fistula continues to be a serious surgical problem. They are related with major electrolyte imbalances, malnutrition and delayed tissue healing. Our recent experience with enterocutaneous fistulas is reviewed hereby. Methods: We analyzed the charts of all patients with enterocutaneous fistula from January 2006 to December 2008. Fistulas were assessed for localization, type, output, etiology, use of somatostatin analog and fibrin glue, nutritional support, type of surgical intervention, wound VAC, and endoscopic findings. Results: We identified 20 patients. Fistulas were localized as gastroduodenal in five patients, jejuno-ileal in seven, and colonic in eight. There were 11 enterocutaneous and 9 entero-atmospheric fistulas. Endoscopy was performed in 12 patients. Output was low (< 400 ml) in 14, whereas high (> 400) in 6 patients. Seventeen patients developed fistulas due to iatrogenic reasons, six patients had an underlying malignancy, and three patients developed fistulas after pancreatitis. Somatostatin analogs were used in 12 patients. Conservative treatment was performed in 10 patients, primary surgical intervention in 3 patients, and secondary surgical intervention in 7 patients. Fibrin glue was used in 9 patients and was of benefit to 3. Healing was achieved in 18 patients (90%) after mean 19.3 days (range 14-75).

The surviving and mortal groups of patients were compared for demographic data, etiological factors and treatment modality besides length of hospital stay and treatment cost. Results: The mean age of the patients was 54.5 years and female/ male ratio was 6/12. Mortality was seen in 6 (33.3) patients and significantly high in female (66.6%) (p = 0.035). The most frequent comorbid disease was diabetes (39.2%), etiological factor was perianal abscess (55.6%) and etiological source was anorectal region (61.1%); and they did not affect the mortality.

We report an asymptomatic PTCA in a young patient. Case: 26-year-old male, with no significant previous history. Admitted intubated and ventilated after a car runover. He had cerebral, thoracic, abdominal, pelvic and lower extremity trauma. Initial assessment disclosed eight left fractured ribs with associated pneumothorax; FAST was negative, head CT normal. Thoracic CT reveled small bilateral hemothoraces and pulmonary contusion, with no evidence of vascular lesions. He also had a fibular, clavicle, and pelvis fracture. Control angio-CT at day 40 showed pleural and pericardial effusions and raised the suspicion of left descending PTCA, subsequently confirmed with MRI. The patient remained asymptomatic with normal EKG and cardiac enzymes throughout this period. A coronariogram confirmed the PTCA, that had undergone spontaneous thrombosis, with no further treatment required. Discussion: Coronary aneurysms (true or false) may occur after blunt thoracic trauma. PTCA normally result from controlled rupture post myocardial infarction or cardiac contusion, with gradual wall rupture. Although in this patient the diagnosis was made without any clinical manifestation, suspicion is the main key for diagnosis. Aneurysms must be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients with thoracic trauma history associated with arterial emboli, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, chest pain or dyspnea.

Introduction: In our previous study, we examined the treatment results of burn patients older than 45 years, and found a significant increase in mortality with increasing age groups. The aim of the present study was to reevaluate this patient group and also compare these results with the previous study period of 1979 to 1998. Patients and Methods: One-hundred and fifteen patients older than 45 years were admitted to our burn unit during the last 10 years. These patients were divided to three groups with respect to their ages (Group A: 45-60 years, Group B: 61-59 years, and Group C: older than 70 years). Demographic properties of patients, etiology, and extend of burn injury, co-morbidity, length of hospital stay, and mortality rates were recorded. Results: During the last 10 years, demographic properties and etiology of burn injury did not changed significantly. However overall survival rate increased from 51.3 to 82% and LD 50 values for burn injury are significantly increased in all age groups. Length of hospital stay is significantly decreased in all age groups, especially in Group B (from 60.7 to 26.5 days).

Introduction and Objectives: Preparation is essential to meet the challenge of optimal care for a sudden unexpected surge of casualties due to a major incident. By definition, requirements exceed standard care facilities in qualitative and or quantitative respect and interfere with regular patient care. To meet the growing demand for disasterpreparedness a permanent facility to provide structured, prepared relief in such situations was developed. We describe this facility. Objectives: The aim of this study is to find out the effects of melatonin on the erythrocyte and kidney malodyaldehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels in radiocontrast nephropathy. Methods: In this study, 24 New Zealand type rabbits were included. The test subjects were divided into four groups six rabbits in each (control, sham, hydration and melatonin groups). Blood samples of all subjects were taken in beginning of study. Renal tissue was obtained in the control group. The rest received 10 ml Diatrizoat sodium intravenously. Hydration group was given 10 ml/kg/day IV bolus 0.09% NaCl. Melatonin group was given 10 mg/kg IV melatonin four times with the same dose isotonic. It was blood and renal tissue samples were taken at the 48th and 72nd hours.

In this study our goal is to assess the safety and efficacy of parenteral glutamine on antioxidant capacity and organ dysfunction in septic patients. Methods: Prospective, randomized study of the septic patients admitted to the surgical intensive care unit (ICU). Patients were randomized to receive either glutamine (Group GLU, n = 12) or glutamine + N-acetylcysteine (group NAC, n = 11) or a control supplement-placebo (group PLA, n = 10) parenterally up to 10 days. Organ dysfunction and clinical outcomes were assessed by daily total Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score over the 10-day study period. Serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was measured by CUPRAC method. Also we evaluated procalcitonin (PRC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels as infection markers on days 0, 3, 6, and 10. Results: There was no significant differences between the patients' ages, APACHE II, SOFA scores and infection markers on the day of admission. Group GLU and NAC showed a significant decline of daily total SOFA score (GLU: p < 0.05, NAC: p < 0.001, PLA: p = 0.05) and CRP levels (GLU: p < 0.05, NAC: p < 0.001, PLA: p < 0.05). But PRC levels decreased significantly over time just in group GLU (GLU: p < 0.001, NAC: p = 0.2, PLA: p = 0.05). On the other hand, serum TAC measurements were not significant. The mean ICU length of stay were GLU: 29 \u00b1 19.2, NAC: 12.4 \u00b1 6.7, PLA: 12.5 \u00b1 8.7 (GLU/NAC: p < 0.05, GLU/PLA: p < 0.05), but in group GLU the overall mortality was significantly lower than NAC and PLA groups (GLU: 25%, NAC: 45%, PLA: 40%). Conclusion: In septic patients, parenteral supplementation with glutamine results in significantly better recovery of organ function compared with NAC and PLA.

The purpose of the study is to assess any indicators of improved survival. Mater\u0131al and methods: Retrospective study of 64 trauma patients, who underwent haemodialysis over a period of 5 years (patients with penetrating, blunt trauma and burns). Information on pre-hospital and in-hospital resuscitation, trauma scores and physiological scores and daily ICU records were collected. The majority of patients were initially dialysed with CVVHD and later on with SLED. Results: Of the 64 patients, 47 died and overall mortality was 73.4%. This was highest in the group of burn patients (84%). Survival in all patients irrespective of mechanism of injury was unrelated to RTS, ISS, APACHE II and TRISS. The duration of haemodialysis be-tween the three different trauma mechanism groups was not significantly different. Age is not a significant predictor of survival. Patients with polyuria at time of initiation of haemodialysis had not a better outcome than those who were oliguric/anuric/normouric. Conclusions: ARF in trauma patients has a low survival rate. Controversial conclusions have been presented in the literature. In our study, none of the parameters reported in previous publications to affect survival was proven as correct, although our number of patients was comparable to that of other studies. As we are still at an early stage of understanding the predictors and the behaviour of renal failure in the trauma patients there is a need for the planning multicentric prospective studies. Weaning from mechanical ventilation constitutes a dynamic process, and represents one of the most challenging decisions in the management of critically ill patients. Success of weaning depends on multiple factors, and wrong decisions result either in prolonged mechanical ventilation, or reintubation and nosocomial pneumonia. Many mathematical indexes have been described and used for decision making with varying successes. We have developed a multiparameter fuzzy-logic decision support system for prediction of success of weaning from mechanical ventilator. After fuzzifying relevant numerical variables, this system evaluates the appropriateness of perfusion, arterial blood gases, mechanical properties, and gas exchange, and converts these to a weaning probability. System has been designed using jFuzzyLogic package and uses Mamdani center of gravity algorithm for defuzzification.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Haemodialysis for Acute Renal Failure in Trauma Patients"}, {"text": "After optimization system has been tested over a software that creates random clinical scenarios within a range that can represent challenging patients.

Additionally we would like to discuss the potential of fuzzy-logic in clinical decision support, and design and optimization issues. Trauma scoring systems used for uniform reporting and evaluation of trauma outcomes include physiologic, anatomic and combined systems. These systems have already been evaluated and shown to have accurate performance. We proposed a possible effect of response to resuscitation on the performance of trauma scoring. Data necessary for calculation of ISS, RTS, TRISS and ASCOT systems have been retrospectively collected from the records of last 150 consecutive trauma patients admitted to our surgical critical care unit. Score and mortality prediction calculations have been performed over a software developed in our department, at three time points, at admission to ER, after 1 h of resuscitation, and at ICU admission. Additionally a fuzzy-logic inference system which uses physiologic variables as input has been designed for trauma related mortality prediction and applied to the same dataset. Performances of scoring systems and fuzzy-logic inference system have been evaluated. Results indicated that all systems have good discrimination, but variable calibration characteristics. For all systems evaluated response to resuscitation has effected system performance and scores and predicted mortality values calculated after resuscitation have shown better discrimination. Fuzzy-logic inference system designed has shown discrimination characteristics comparable but not better then the other systems, which indicate the importance of inclusion of specific organ injuries in trauma scoring and mortality prediction.

The ''Traumax \u00d2 '' hip screw plate is a new device that allows the treatment the fractures both of the neck and the trochanteric area of the femur, expected subtrochanteric area. This plate conserves the characteristics of a dynamic hip screw (compression of the fracture site, good positioning of the pieces of bone, integrity of gluteus muscles) more specific characteristics: this device is modular, allows to choose the length of the barrel adapted to the length of the head screw, the diaphysal screws are locked by a tech nut according to the patented ''Surfix'' system. The locked screw gives a good stability even if the bone has a poor density and allows to use a short plate that preserves the piercing lateral vessels of the femur. This short modular screw plate can be implanted by a 3 cm minimal invasive approach using a particular instrumental pipe. During the presentation we will report the results of a prospective study colligating 250 cases of ten French hospitals. A preliminary study of 60 consecutives cases gives prominence to a few blooding with an average of 180 ml, a operative time of an average of 32 mn, a xr exposing time of an average of 16 s. Healing bone has been obtained in all cases. The head screw has been placed at the center or just below in 97%. No complication dues to the plate has been reported; in all cases only one approach has been used. Aim: To assess moderate-term outcomes of silastic joint replacements of the first metatarsophalangeal joint. Methods: The 32 patients (37 feet) that had silastic implants inserted were reviewed at an average of 2 years and 4 months (ranging 7 months to 5 years and 4 months). The mean patient age was 63 years. These patients answered a subjective questionnaire, had their feet examined clinically and radiographically and a pre-operative and post-operative AOFAS score was calculated for each. Results: The questionnaire revealed that every patient described that their pain had decreased after surgery and 17 feet (46%) were completely pain free. There was a significant improvement in patients' subjective pain scores after surgery (t value \u00a3 0.0001). Preoperatively, the mean pain score for all 37 feet was 8.14, whereas post-operative the mean pain score was 1.32. The mean AOFAS score before surgery was 39.97. This increased to a mean score of 87.40 after surgery (p \u00a3 0.0001). This again is a significant improvement. No patient was dissatisfied with the outcome with their surgery.

Objective: To assess the effectiveness of mobile angiography with a digital subtraction angiography (DSA) technology directly into the emergency room (ER) for blunt trauma patients with pelvic injury. Materials-methods: This is a retrospective review of a cohort of blunt trauma patients with pelvic injury treated after the direct availability of mobile angiography by trained trauma surgeons into the ER for resuscitation. Data was collected including demographics, hemodynamic variables, resuscitation intervals form admission through completion of hemostasis, metabolic factors (pH and body core temperature), mortality and transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) related complications. Results: Twenty-nine patients underwent TAE in the ER. Mean age, shock index, and injury severity score were 40 \u00b1 17 years old, 1.1 \u00b1 0.6, and 30 \u00b1 14, respectively. The interval from the decision to perform TAE through initiation of TAE and the interval from the decision to perform TAE through completion of TAE were 31 \u00b1 12 min and 110 \u00b1 32 min, respectively. The mean Dbody core temperature (BT) from admission through completion of TAE was -0.2 \u00b1 1.5\u00b0C. And the mean DpH from admission through completion of TAE was 0.02 \u00b1 0.13. There were clinically significant correlations between DBT and resuscitation interval, and between DpH and resuscitation interval. TAE was successfully performed in all cases and mortality was 17%.

In group 1 (n = 20), K-wire applied after closed reduction. In group 2 (n = 20), only cast was applied following closed reduction. The mean follow-up was 20 months. The compared clinical and radiological parameters were; pain, limb deformity, range of motion of the wrist, angulation of the fracture site, radial distal epiphyseal angle and severity of translation. Redisplacement rate was 10% in group 1 and 50% in group 2. This shows, Kirschner wire fixation had a positive effect in continuity of the initial reduction (p = 0.014). Age (p = 0.289), gender (p = 0.264), reduction quality (p = 0.970) had no effect on redisplacement. Concerning the severity of translation, the risk of redisplacement increases in stage 3 (50-100%) and stage 4 (> 100%) fractures (p = 0.003). Concomitant complete ulnar fracture had also redisplacement risk (p = 0.016). Redisplacement risk increases when the distance of fracture line to epiphyseal line was between 11 and 20 mm (p = 0.073). There was no significant difference between two groups after last evaluation based on radiological parameters and clinical results (p > 0.05). As a conclusion; this study shows that Kirschner wire fixation prevents redisplacement in early follow-up of first 3 weeks but there is no superiority after 20 months follow-up in distal metaphyseal fractures of children. Patients in group C showed the best functional results, the greatest ankle range of motion, the fastest full bearing, the fastest walking on toes and heels, and the shortest duration of physical limitations (walking on uneven ground and sports activities) (p < 0.001 for all). In group B, there were two reruptures, in group C one, and in group A there were no reruptures. Good functional results and a relatively small number of postsurgical complications advocate the usage of surgical techniques. The best and fastest functional recovery was attained in the group treated with the original technique of percutaneous fixation with two embracing and crossed loops.

Surgical technique: We reduce the fracture percutaneously by towel clips with the patient in the supine position. We insert two 3.0 mm Kirschner (K) wires in a caudocranial direction under arthroscopic control. We do four stab incisions to assign the inferolateral (IL) and inferomedial (IM), superolateral (SL) and superomedial (SM) portals besides the K wire tips. We insert a trocar with its cannula from SL portal to SM portal under the K wires. We take the trocar out and leave the cannula inside. We run 18-gauge cerclage wire through the cannula in SL to SM direction. We take out the cannula. We perform exactly the same steps directed from SM portal to IL portal, from IL portal to IM portal, and from IM portal to SL portal, respectively. Finally near the SL portal, wires are secured with a single knot. We check the fixation by C scope. Results: Radiographic consolidation was achieved in all five patients at an average of 2 months.

Introduction: Injury of the soft tissue results in a release of numerous cytokines, which activate fibroblasts of the surrounding tissue to proliferate and to undergo a phenotypic transdifferentiation into contractile myofibroblasts (MFs). In this study we analyzed the hypothesis, that human joint capsule MFs are specifically regulated by the cytokine IFN-c via the modulation of alpha-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) which is responsible for the contractile phenotype. Methods: Joint capsules were obtained from patients undergoing orthopaedic surgeries. To investigate the functional effect of IFN-c, we cultured MFs in a three-dimensional (3D)-collagen gel contraction model. An alamarBlue assay in combination with the collagen gels was established to analyze the viability and the proliferative capacity of MFs upon IFN-c treatment. The effect of IFN-c stimulation on the gene expression levels of the specific MF markers a-SMA and collagen I is going to be determined by real-time PCR (RT-PCR).

Prospective randomised research is required in order to determine the right surgical indications and to find out what the long-term results of this relatively new method of fixation are. Aim: Our main aim was to find out whether there is a place for nonoperative treatment as a definitive primary option in patients with significant medical co-morbidity.

The decision was made by orthopaedic consultants in ten cases and by multidisciplinary team in four cases. Five patients refused surgery and five patients were palliative due to terminal illnesses. Patients who did not proceed to surgery had significantly higher mortality rates (overall mortality rate 60%) suggesting that they were physiologically much worse group of patients. Conclusion: As the average life span of our population increases, some hip fractures are now treated nonoperatively because of the possibility of severe or fatal complications due to surgery. Often, refusal of surgery by the patient or the patients' family obligates the need for nonoperative treatment. It might be acceptable not to opt for the surgery if the patients are medically very high risk because of these reasons (e.g. acute cardiac event, severe aortic stenosis, multiorgan failure etc). The burden of patients with pubic rami fractures seems to be increasing. More patients with pubic rami fractures are admitted to hospital due to the absolute increase in the number of elderly people. Although pubic ramus fractures are generally considered a benign fracture for its inherent stability experience indicated that this fracture is accompanied with a high morbidity and mortality. In a case-control study patients aged over 60 years old with an isolated single fracture of the pubic rami admitted to the hospital were compared for morbidity and mortality to age-and gender matched hospitalized patients without fractures. Data was acquired by the patient files. During 14 years 99 patients, with a median age of 80.1 (range: 60-98) years, were admitted with a median length of stay of 10 days (range: 2-57).

Purpose: Comminute fractures of the radial head are challenging to treat with open reduction and internal fixation. Radial head arthroplasty is an alternative treatment. The purpose of this study was evaluating our results of a closely followed cohort of patients in whom an unreconstructible radial head fracture had been treated with modular pyrocarbon/metallic prosthesis. Methods: From May 2003 to September 2007, 24 patients were operated for traumatic injuries in elbow. There were 12 female and 12 male with mean age 49 (34-70 years). The follow-up was a mean of 31 months (12-54 months). Fractures of the radial head have been classified by Mason with a subsequent modification by Johnston. The indication for a radial head replacement are comminuted type III fractures in 16 cases, type IV in 5 cases, and Monteggia variant with olecranon and radial head fractures in 3 cases. Results: By using the Mayo elbow Score, 18 patients had good/ excellent results, with 5 fair and 1 poor outcomes. Patients showed an average arc of motion from -10\u00ba to 135\u00ba. Complications were three implant dislocations, needed to remove the implant. Asymptomatic radiographic heterotopic ossification in elbow was showed in one case and bone lucencies were found in seven cases. We had not seen persistent instability, infection, synostosis, loosening, severe degenerative changes or impingement.

External fixation has already became on the end of last century as routine temporarily method of fracture bone fixation, especially in the light of damage control. But out of damage control, external fixation has been accepted in many developed countries as routine temporarily method in treatment of complex articular fractures (knee, ankle, elbow). The main reason was absence (night time, weekend) of experienced surgeon who can treat these complex particular fractures, as during the night. Sometimes, the skin problem can prolong such fixation for three or more weeks. However, external fixation of tibia and distal radius can be method of choose for definitive treatment not only in open but in closed fractures as well. It becomes justified when high mobile and relatively simple external fixation devices have been developed allowing addition correction of reduction. In this paper, we want to present possibility of using already applied, external fixation device as temporarily method. About 1 week after external fixation done (on femur or tibia) we developed technique existing external fixator to be used as a reduction device. Once, desirable fracture reduction achieved, internal fixation is very easy and we do not need fluoroscopy control for reduction, just for internal device fixation by minimally invasive method. Using this method, we already treated 10 patients with femur fractures and 12 with tibia fractures. From results obtained it can be concluded that external fixator developed by Mitkovic is suitable to function as accurate fracture reduction device providing condition for simple minimally invasive internal fixation.

The mechanism of injury were motor vehicle accident in 19, fall from high in 4 and industrial accidents in 2 patients. 11 patients had additional extremity trauma. Vascular injury detected in 4 knees who required immediate reconstruction by vascular surgeons. The orthopaedic stabilization of the initial injury was bridging external fixation in 13 knees included all vascular injuries. 5 patients had fibular nerve palsy.

However, the indication of how successful the treatment has been is the functional outcome of the patient. Functional outcome of upper-extremity fractures can be measured reliably using the DASH (Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand) Outcome Measure. Materials-Methods: 39 consecutive patients with 40 non-or minimally displaced scaphoid fractures, treated conservatively, were included. The trauma mechanism, treatment modality, diagnostic modalities, duration of cast immobilization and complications were analysed for all patients. Functional outcome was measured using the DASH Outcome Measure. Results: 30 patients showed good clinical and radiologic outcome after 6 weeks of cast immobilization with a mean DASH of 4.6. Six patients consolidated within 12 weeks with a mean DASH of 11.8. Three patients with four fractures took more than 12 weeks to achieve clinical and radiologic consolidation and had a mean DASH of 38.5. The DASH questionnaires showed statistically significant differences between patient age, fracture location and duration of cast immobilization. Conclusion: Conservative treatment of non-or minimally displaced scaphoid fractures results in good functional outcome after 6 weeks of cast immobilization, particularly in young patients with distal or waist scaphoid fractures. Objective: Pedicle screw instrumentation is the most common procedure in stabilizing fractures of the throracolumbar spine, but yields an immanent potential for iatrogenic damage due to malpositioned pedicle screws. Methods-materials: 99 patients undergoing posterior instrumentations were included. Preoparative CT scans were used to determine fracture level and classification. Postoperative CT scan were evaluated for screw positions of all pedicle screws. Cobb angles were compared to calculate the degree of reduction.

Introduction: Intramedullary nailing is challenging in proximal tibia fractures, associated with high rates of malalignment. To date, no studies report the potential of lateral tibia nail insertion to correct primary valgus malalignment, commonly seen in proximal quarter fractures. Materials and methods: 18 fresh-frozen cadaver lower extremities were used to simulate an AO/OTA 41-A3 fracture. Six nails (Expert Tibial Nailing System, Synthes, Salzburg, Austria) were inserted at the lateral third, six nails at the middle third and six nails at the medial third of the lateral tibia plateau. After nail insertion, alignment in the coronal plane was recorded. Results: Mean varus malalignment was dependent on the entry point at the lateral tibia plateau. Mean varus malalignment was 16\u00b0if nails were inserted at the lateral third, 10\u00b0at the middle third and 4\u00b0after nail insertion at the medial third. If nails were inserted from the medial third, valgus malalignment was recorded in two specimens. Discussion: The effect of correction of coronal malalignment in proximal tibia fractures is dependent on the point of nail entry at the lateral plateau. Primary valgus deformation up to 20\u00b0can be corrected by inserting tibia nails at the lateral third of the lateral tibia plateau. Surgeons should be aware of possible varus deformity and valgus malalignment despite lateral nail insertion.

Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed for a consecutive series of patients with conservatively treated distal radial fractures. Axial radial shortening, radial displacement, radial angle, dorsal angle, and dorsal displacement were measured on the postero-anterior and lateral X-rays. Functional outcome was measured using the Quick DASH-score (QDS). Minimal follow up was 24 months. The radiological findings of patients who met the criteria for conservative treatment were compared to those of patients that met the current criteria for operative treatment (dorsal angulation > 10\u00b0, radial angle > 10\u00b0, radial displacement > 2 mm, radial shortening > 5 mm and step off > 2 mm) but who had been treated conservatively instead. Results: In a 2-year period 396 patients were treated conservatively for a distal radial fracture. The QDS was performed in 256 (65%) patients. Male female ratio was 1:3, the average age was 60 years (range 18-94). The mean QDS was 12 (SD \u00b1 18; range 11-84). Age and female sex associated negatively with the QDS. None of the radiologic findings was associated with the QDS. Half of the patients met the current criteria for operative treatment.

In this study, the clinical and radiological results of conservative treatment are retrospectively evaluated. The patients were treated with closed reduction, plaster splint and brace. Methods: Dislocations of all 21 patients were towards posterior and the average length of immobilization was 20.2 days (7-30 days) after closed reduction. The patients were assessed clinically for range of motion, instability, and atrophy after 33.9 months of mean follow up. Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS) was used to evaluate functional outcome. Standard elbow X-rays were evaluated for degeneration, heterotopic ossification, and concentric reduction. Results: The average age of the patients was 35.4 (12-81) years. None of the patients had muscular atrophy. Four patients (19.1%) reported mild pain with heavy activity. Six patients (28.6%) had neurological complaints related with ulnar nerve. The average flexion arc and average rotational arc were 131\u00b0and 172\u00b0, respectively. The differences between the contralateral elbow motions were 10.9\u00b0for flexion arc and 3.1\u00b0for rotational arc. Four patients (19%) had minimal residual instability. Three patients (14.3%) had mild radiographic signs of arthrosis and 14 patients (66.7%) showed minimal-mild degree of heterotopic ossification. An average score of 96.9 was obtained using MEPS. Only four patients (19%) considered themselves fully recovered. Conclusion: Closed reduction and immobilization is a universal method for simple elbow dislocations. However, although functional scores were excellent, most of the patients did not consider themselves fully recovered. Anterior odontoid screw fixation (AOSF) is a valuable treatment after OF, reported union rates in the elderly vary between 70 and 100% when assessed on plain radiographs. In this study union-rates in OF treated with AOSF in patients aged \u2021 60 years were revisited and risk factors for non-union analyzed. Retrospective data review of a prospectively gathered C2-fracture patients treated with AOSF for OF and age \u2021 60 years were included for study. Asides demographics and common injury characteristics, injury radiographs and CT-scans were assessed for fracture displacement, type, atlantodental osteoarthritis and particularly focussing on the square surface of OF. Follow-up CT-scans were assessed for technical failures, odontoid union, number of screws in AOSF, square surface of screws used and the related healing surface. There were 13 male (72.2%) and 5 female (17.8%) patients with a mean age of 78.1 \u00b1 7.6 years at injury (60-87y). Mean follow-up with CT-scans was 75.7 \u00b1 50.8 months (4.2-150.2mo).

Mean square surface of fractures was 127.1 \u00b1 50.9 mm 2 (56.3-215.9 mm 2 ) and mean osseus healing surface was 84.0 \u00b1 6.8% (67.6-91.1%). CT-based analysis revealed osseus union in nine (50%), while the remaining nine patients (50%) revealed non-union. In two patients, symptomatic non-union indicated posterior fusion of C1-2.

Retrospectively, all data were reviewed of hemodynamically unstable patients with a pelvic ring fracture in the period 1/1/1999 till 1/9/2006. Of all patients, the pathway of treatment was analysed and compared with the standardized treatment protocol in our clinic. All injuries were categorized in injuries in Airway, Breathing, Circulation and Disability according to ATLS \u00d2 principles. Death was classified as directly related to the pelvic fracture if the patient required massive transfusions, died within 24 h after admission and had no other body area injury with AIS \u2021 4 responsible for persistent hemorrhagic shock. We reviewed the data of 115 patients. 26/115 patients died (23%). These patients were significant older and had a significant higher ISS and shock class than survivors. Two patients died of pulmonary trauma (7%), 11 patients (43%) died of exsanguination(C) and 7 patients (28%) died due to major head trauma. In 6 patients (21%) there was a combination of injuries, which caused death. Thus, overall hypovolemic shock contributed to mortality in 17 cases. Only in three patients death could be directly related to hemorrhage from the pelvis. Two nonsurviving patients (8%) were not treated according to our standardized treatment protocol. In the survivor group this was only one patient. There is no consensus on the treatment of the acute total Achilles tendon rupture. Treatment modality is chosen on the basis of patient characteristics or the preference of the attending surgeon. Using ultrasound, the distance between the two tendon ends in equinus position can be measured. This could form the basis for decision making between conservative-and surgical treatment. This cohort study consists of 164 consecutive patients, between January 2000 and January 2007. Using ultrasound, patients were assigned to a surgicalor conservative treatment group.

Introduction: Missile wounds induced by aviation bomb splinters pertain to grave injuries, due to large wound area and high risk of complications. Material-methods: 11 patients with large defects, in 7 of casescombined with long bone fractures caused by missile injuries were treated by us in the period of August-November in 2008. Every cases were subjected to radical primary debridement with complete drainage. After relevant preparation for soft tissue plastic repair (involving primary radical debridement, primary external fixation, complex drug therapy and repetitive regular debridement) the following repair procedures were undertaken: In four cases, soft tissue defects were covered via rotation of local flaps. In three cases, defects were covered through transplantation of free skin grafts. In four cases, large soft tissue defects were overlayed by vascularized thoraco-dorsal (LD flap).

Introduction: Shoulder arthroplasty remains a valuable treatment for complex fractures of the proximal humerus. However the success of anatomical arthroplasty is mainly dependent of anatomical healing of the tuberosities. Even with specific prostheses and fixation techniques in 25-40% of cases anatomical healing is not achieved. Using a nonfracture specific trauma prosthesis we achieved better elevation and abduction; however endorotation, exorotation, subjective shoulder rating and complication rate did score poorer than in anatomical arthroplasty. We assumed that the impossibility to refixate the lesser and greater tuberosity fragment, and subsequently the subscapularis and infraspinatus-teres minor tendons, are the main cause for this observation Material-methods: We developed a fracture specific reversed shoulder prosthesis allowing for anatomical refixation of the tuberosities. We included 20 patients in the reversed fracture arthroplasty group. Function is scored using the constant Murley-score. Radiographically we evaluate for evidence of scapular notching. Complications are recorded. We compare our results to an historical series of Delta III prostheses. Results: At 6 months the mean Constant score is 51.5 points. There was no case of notching. There was one complication, an early infect. The mean Constant score in the Delta group was 42 points. There was notching present in 55% of cases.

Introduction: As fractures of the femur are severe injuries and patients mostly suffer from extensive pain they quickly attract the physician's attention in the emergency room. The literature has shown that injuries to the ipsilateral knee can occur accompanying such injuries. In most cases, these injuries though were diagnosed on delay. Excluding cases in which a knee injury was apparent already on admission, we sought to investigate the number and severity of initially undetected lesions to the knee accompanying a femoral shaft fracture and give an overview of the literature. Methods: Charts and X-rays of patients treated for a femoral shaft fracture from January 2000 until December 2007 were reviewed. Patients, in whom any other injury of the affected limb apart from a midshaft femoral fracture was initially diagnosed, were excluded. Also patients, in whom an injury to the knee had been diagnosed on admission, were excluded. Results: Fifty-three patients with midshaft femoral fractures were available for analysis. An injury to the knee was diagnosed in 3 cases (5%). There was one partial tear of the posterior cruciate ligament and two grade 2 lesions of the medial meniscus. All lesions were conservatively treated. The shoulder is the most mobile joint of the human body. It has a great range of movement that takes place in all three Cartesian planes. This is a complex phenomenon. There is considerable controversy over an ideal method for the functional assessment of shoulder joint complex. Various methods have been used but they are often inaccurate and unreliable. Thus, a better technique, that is reliable as well as repeatable, is required to measure the movements.

Patients and methods: From October 2005, thoracic views for detection of PTX are systematically included in the EFAST protocol during primary survey for every trauma patients (pts) admitted to our Level I Trauma Center. Among hospitalized pts, a selective USguided aspiration for small PTX was applied in three pts (two with a slow reabsorption time, one in a pt requiring hyperbaric oxygen therapy for a soft tissue infection of the leg). In supine position, delimitation of the area of anterior PTX was done with a linear probe, searching for lung points in adjacent intercostal spaces. Under local anesthesia, a 8 Fr catheter was inserted in the PTX and aspiration monitored in real time by US, until restoration of sliding lung. The day after, after confirmation of normal gliding lung, two pts were discharged and one deemed suitable for hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Discussion: Small traumatic PTX is generally monitored without treatment. In some pts, drainage is however required, but the procedure is blind if performed on the basis of CXR findings. US allows to precisely define the site and the limits of PTX, insert a small catheter in the right area, monitoring reexpansion of the lung and complete aspiration of PTX and shortening recovery.

The procedures were simply diagnostic in nine patients. The mean operating time and hospital stay were 36.4 min and 4.7 days, respectively. There was neither intraoperative or early postoperative complication, nor mortality. In a patient who had intra thoracic adhesions due to prior tuberculosis, unmentioned by the patient preoperatively, adequate exploration could not be achieved during thoracoscopy.

Conclusion: Thoracoscopy seems to be a safe, quick and efficient method in the diagnosis and treatment of diaphragmatic wounds, due to thoracoabdominal penetrating injuries. The nonoperative management is gradually more used in abdominal stab injuries and surgeons can resort to thoracoscopy and laparoscopy as a minimally invasive, diagnostic and therapeutic tool.

Hepatic portal venous gas (HPVG) is often associated with serious intra-abdominal pathology like ischaemic bowel disease and necrotizing enterocolitis, with reported mortality rates above 75%, with most requiring urgent operation. However, HPVG has been reported seen on ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scans immediately after blunt trauma, followed by spontaneous resolution. Gastric pneumatosis (GP) has rarely been reported as a trauma-related entity. The combination of HPVG and GP after blunt trauma has been described in very few patients. We report the case of a 16-year-old woman who presented with an EDH requiring craniotomy and an initial abdominal CT scan showing only an OIS grade 2 liver injury. A transient increase in serum amylase combined with abdominal distension led to a repeat abdominal CT scan 48 h post injury to rule out pancreatic and duodenal injuries, revealing GP and HPVG. Endoscopy demonstrated mucosal erythema of the posterior gastric wall from the fundus to the pylorus.

Background: At our department, a simple scoring system based on three criteria (blood pressure below 90, BE below -7.5 and body temperature below 35\u00b0C) has been used to determine the suitability of individual patients as candidates for DCS. Objectives: The present study was undertaken to establish a valid strategy for the treatment of severe pancreatic injury and to test the validity of the scoring system used at our department for identifying suitable candidates for DCS. Subjects and methods: The subjects of the study were 12 patients with the grater and equal of grade III (Organ Injury Scale (OIS))pancreatic injury treated surgically (type III in 3 cases and IV or V in 9 cases). Results: Resection of the pancreatic body and tail was performed in both the groups to treat type III injury, and all of the cases with type III injury had favorable outcomes. Among the cases with type IV or V injury, all of those patients satisfying two or fewer than two of the criteria of the DCS scoring system survived DCS, while two patients satisfying all the three criteria of the DCS scoring system died after DCS. The two patients who underwent pancreatic duct-forming surgery needed prolonged hospitalization. Discussion: Our results suggest that DCS should be selected in cases where at least one of the three criteria of the DCS scoring system is satisfied. As a procedure for radical operation, resection of the distal pancreas may be recommended for type III, and pancreatoduodenectomy for type IV or V. Author to editor: Our results suggest that DCS should be selected in cases where at least one of the three criteria (systolic pressure below 90, severe hypothermia with body temperature below 35\u00b0C, and acidosis with BE below -7.5) of the DCS scoring system is satisfied.

Introduction: The liver is the most commonly affected organ in abdominal trauma. In our Department, the majority of traumatic liver injuries are treated conservatively. This option involves the monitoring of possible complications, such as late rupture, hemobilia, arterio-venous fistula, pseudo-aneurysm, biloma and abscess formation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results:"}, {"text": "Case: A 19 year-old patient was admitted after a 8 m fall. Established diagnoses were: multiple facial fractures, right pneumothorax with pulmonary contusion, right renal artery thrombosis and grade 3 hepatic laceration. The patient was discharged on the 21st post-trauma day (PTD), after an uneventful course. On the 61st PTD, he was readmitted for abdominal pain. Thoracoabdominal CT revealed an intra-hepatic arterio-venous fistula. Angiographic superselective embolization was performed, and the patient was discharged following a control abdominal CT scan that showed resolution of the fistula. He was again readmitted on the 84th PTD, with abdominal pain, jaundice and gastrointestinal bleeding. An abdominal ultrasound raised the possibility of hemobilia, confirmed by upper endoscopy. A new angiography did not reveal any active bleeding, and an abdominal CT showed satisfactory evolution of the liver lesion. The patient was discharged on the 97th PTD, asymptomatic. At 6 month follow-up, the patient presents no complaints, other than a new-onset arterial hypertension of renovascular origin. Conclusion: Arteriovenous fistulae and hemobilia are relatively uncommon sequelae of abdominal trauma. However, these diagnoses should be actively sought in the presence of abdominal pain, especially when associated with jaundice and gastrointestinal bleeding. A multidisciplinary approach is essential for a successful treatment. Diaphragmatic hernias constitute frequent complications after thoracic and abdominal trauma (0.8-5%), especially on the left side (90%) and the diagnosis is frequently delayed. Clinical presentation is variable and may include respiratory distress and abdominal pain, frequently attributed to intestinal obstruction, pancreatitis, biliary colic or peptic disease. The authors present a case report of a right diaphragmatic hernia diagnosed 2 years after a thoracoabdominal blunt trauma. The male patient, 64 years old, was admitted in the Emergency Room with epigastric pain, bloating, slight abdominal distension with 6 months of evolution and recent worsening. He suffered a previous thoracoabdominal trauma 2 years ago, consecutive to a downfall of about eight meters high with lumbar vertebrae fracture (L1) and was submitted to conservative treatment in an orthopaedic ward; X-ray signs of diaphragmatic hernia were unrecognized. Actual chest X-ray revealed an elevated right hemidiaphragm and presence of abdominal content in the right hemithorax. MR demonstrated a right hemidiaphragmatic rupture and the presence of abdominal content in the thoracic cavity. Patient was operated by laparoscopic approach; a diaphragmatic hernia grade III (A.A.S.T. classification) was observed and submitted to prosthetic repair. Postoperative period was uneventful. Patient remains asymptomatic with no signs of recurrence after 3 years. This case is paradigmatic of the difficulty of immediate diagnosis of diaphragmatic hernias, especially at the right hemidiaphragm. High index of clinical suspicion is needed for its early recognition in context of blunt trauma. Laparoscopic treatment revealed to be safe and efficient, with the known advantages of minimally invasive procedures. Results: Their ages were between 5 AND 69, 168 were male and 35 were female. The type of injury was penetrating in 122, blunt in 80 and blunt and penetrating in 1 patient. In 117 patients, the left kidney was injured, in 80 the injury was at right kidney and in 6 injuries was bilateral. The average transport time to hospital was 112 min (30 min-10 days). One hundred and seventeen out of 203 patients were explored immediately as they hemodynamically unstable position. Remaining 86 patients were evaluated with ultrasonography, intravenous urography and computerised tomography. Sixty four of these patients were followed conservatively.

Introduction: Intra and retro abdominal hemorrhage are common following blind and penetrating abdominal trauma. Liver, spleen and kidneys are known to be prone to injury and to bleed after an abdominal trauma. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a well known disease. However, a renal mass from a primary origin in the liver is rare. This paper presents a patient, who was treated with right nephrectomy for traumatic bleeding from a ruptured renal mass. End diagnosis was metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma. Case: The patient was 50-years-old man. He had no positive medical and surgical history, and no complaint. He was referred to Emergency service after traffic accident. During his initial assessment abdominal rigidity and tenderness were found, which were accompanied with tachycardia and hypotension even after fluid resuscitation. FAST revealed that there was free fluid in his abdomen, so we decided to operate him. At laparotomy we observed a bleeding tumoral mass in the right kidney and in his liver. He was treated with right nephrectomy and irregular hepatectomy. Pathologic examination demonstrated a metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.

GB is afforded significant anatomic protection from external trauma, since it is partially embedded in the relatively massive liver parenchyme, cushioned by the surrounding omentum and intestines, and shielded by ribcage. Clinical symptoms may be minimal or nil initially but gradual clinical deterioration, related to spillage of bile into the peritoneal cavity, can follow. Bilous fluid taken by paracentesis or diagnostic peritoneal lavage can only be helpful after a delay as abdominal computed tomography. An 18year-old male was admitted to our emergency department for the fifth time because of penetrating abdominal trauma of at the right upper quadrant by a knife in a 15-day-period. He was hospitalized in three of them and operated on at last, because of acute abdomen, since paracentesis revealed bile coloured free abdominal fluid in addition to abdominal guarding, leucocytosis(19,000/mm 3 ), and fever.The ultimate ultrasonography and computed tomography revealed large amount of free fluid (bile) and minimal intrahepatic hematoma. At laparotomy; full-cut hepatic and cholecystic perforation (both anterior and posterior surfaces) resulted in cholecystectomy. He was discharged on the fourth postoperative day. Since almost all reports about the delayed rupture of GB are usually unrecognized GB perforations,a diagnostic delay can only be avoided by a high clinical index of suspicion. Sixty-three patients were treated conservatively, whereas 22 patients had laparotomy and 2 patients underwent angiography. Of 47 patients transported by ambulance or helicopter, 83% arrived at the emergency unit within 60 min after prehospital alert. In 57% the time on scene were longer than 10 min. In this group only 31% were diagnosed by CT within 60 min after arrival to the emergency unit. Conclusion: Low volume in trauma care results in substandard handling time. In hospitals with a low volume exposure to trauma, the prehospital response teams and surgeons achieves limited experience, especially in penetrating trauma.

Introduction: Explosives create and energize particles that act as projectiles prone to further fragmentation in the body. These fragments may result in secondary injuries. This has been repeatedly described in the orthopedic and neurosurgical literature. In this paper we demonstrate that such a process is also possible for abdominal injuries during or after fascial penetration. Material-method: In all abdominal wall injuries, despite negative physical examination of conscious and alert patients we used local wound exploration as a standard approach. Finding a full thickness fascial defect, we assumed an intraperitoneal injury and performed laparotomy.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Treatment of Isolated Penetrating Flank Trauma"}, {"text": "Result: Using this method, we found hollow organ injuries in 7 of 8 (87.5%) patients. In 3 (37.5%) of these patients at laparotomy, we found multiple, projectile induced injuries in a sprayed distribution. These injuries were found far from the trajectory, in the absence of bone fragmentation. The mean number of peritoneal defects was 1.7, however, for each peritoneal defect, we found an average of 6.8 intraabdominal injuries when through and through injuries were excluded. Conclusion: Local wound exploration is an accurate indicator of possible intraabdominal injuries. Although fragments of projectiles would be expected to be distributed along the trajectory, meticulous exploration of abdomen is mandatory because this is not always true. Despite a single peritoneal defect, there may be multiple intraperitoneal injuries due to further fragmentation of the projectile.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pancreatic Lesions in Blunt Abdominal Trauma"}, {"text": "Introduction and objectives: Nonoperative management of penetrating abdominal stab wounds has been established as standard care recently.

Delayed small bowel obstruction after blunt trauma is very rare clinical entity. It may be caused by subclinical bowel perforation, localized bowel ischemia or mesenteric vascular injury. We present a 34 years old man of blunt abdominal trauma that was treated nonoperatively. Despite the success medical treatment, 2 months later, the patient presented with abdominal pain and vomiting.

Gastroscopy (n = 1), echocardiography (n = 1), intravenous pyelography (n = 1) were necessitated for further evaluation, but showed no abnormality. The patients were followed up with routine abdominal examinations, vital signs and routine laboratory tests and discharged from the hospital on days 4 and 5 after uneventful recovery periods. Discussion: Patients with penetrating abdominal buckshot wounds may be followed with nonoperative management instead of routine laparotomy. Objective: Treatment procedures in cases who were operated due to colon injuries were investigated in this study. Material-methods: Thirty-two cases who were operated due to colon injuries in our clinic between 2002 and 2008 were investigated retrospectively. Cases were investigated with regard to age, sex, type of trauma, hemodynamic condition, interval between injury and surgery, additional organ injury, transfusion volume, injury site and severity, faecal contamination, surgical procedures, postoperational complications and mortality and factors affecting morbidity and mortality were determined. Colonic Injury Severity Scale (CISS), Abdominal Trauma Index (ATI) and Flint classification were used for evaluating severity of colon injury,severity of additional organ injury and faecal contamination, respectively. Systolic blood pressure less than 80 mmHg on admission was referred to as ''shock''. Results: Males comprised 28 out of 32 cases and mean age was 35.7 (range:17-72) years. Twenty-five cases were injured due to penetrating trauma and left colon injury was the most common (12 cases) type of injury. Additional intraabdominal organ injury and extraabdominal injury were observed in 21 and 6 cases, respectively. Mean interval between injury and surgery was 2.7 (range 0.5-8) h. Fifteen cases received blood transfusion. Five cases had shock on admission. Seven cases received stoma surgery while all cases with Flint grade more than III or ATI score higher than 25 received colostomy. Only cases with high CISS score received resection and anastomosis surgery. Complications were observed in 11 cases while mortality occurred in two cases due to hemorrhagic shock. Conclusion: Routine primary repair cannot always be performed in colon injuries since many factors affect the decision for type of surgery. Primary repair may be performed safely in hemodynamicallystable cases with ATI score less than 25 and Flint grade I-II. Seat belt syndrome is defined as a seatbelt sign associated with lumber spine fracture and bowel perforation. An isolated rectal perforation due to seatbelt syndrome is extremely rare. There is only one case reported in the Danish literature and non in the English literature. Hereby, we report a 48-years old male who was a front seat restrained passenger involved in a head-on collision. He has presented with lower abdominal and back pain. Seat belt mark was seen transversely across the lower abdomen. Initial trauma CT scan was normal except for burst fracture of L5 vertebra which was operated by internal fixation on the same day of admission. The patient continued to have abdominal pain and distention which became clear on the third day. Repeated abdominal CT scan on the third day has shown free intraperitoneal air. Exploratory laparotomy has revealed a perforation of the proximal part of the rectum below the recto sigmoid junction. Hartmann's procedure was performed with end colostomy. The abdomen was left open and temporarily closed using saline IV bags sandwiched between 2 layers of Steri-Drape. Peritoneal toileting was performed four times under general anesthesia with gradual closure of the abdominal fascia over a period of 2 weeks. Postoperatively, the patient had urinary retention due to a quada equina injury although he could walk.

Objectives: Any sort of discomfort in the abdominal cavity that lasts less than 1 week is defined as acute abdominal pain. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the outcome of hospitalized patients with unspecified acute abdominal pain following initial clinical and laboratory evaluation. Method: From January 2008 to December 2008, 114 patients with acute unspecified abdominal pain were admitted to surgery department. Gender, age, definite diagnosis, time from hospitalization to surgery and hospital length of stay were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Fifty-six of the patients with acute unspecified abdominal pain were females (49%) and 58 were males (51%), median age was 34 years (range 16-82). While definite diagnosis was confirmed in 70 patients (62%), the initial diagnosis was not changed in 44 patients (38%). Distribution of new diagnoses were appendicitis (n = 24), gastroenteritis (n = 7), genitourinary disorder (n = 17), Familial Mediterranean Fever (n = 6), inflammatory bowel disease (n = 2), mesenteric adenitis (n = 2), peptic ulcus perforation (n = 1), constipation (n = 1), diverticular disease (n = 1), pneumatosis intestinalis (n = 1), hepatobilier disease (n = 7) and intra abdominal tumor (n = 1).

The ideal TSS must be has some properties: adherence, control of water loss, safety, flexibility, stability on wound surfaces, bacterial barrier, and ease of application, ease storage and cost effectiveness. Case report: A 2-year-old girl was admitted to our burn center with deep flame burns affecting face, thorax, upper and lower extremity (45%). She underwent an early burn excision on day 4 post-burn day. The whole area excised with hydrosurgically was covered with Biobrane \u00d2 and compressive dressing. Seven days after we removed Biobrane from the upper and lower extremities and grafted the wound bed. Face healed spontaneously under the TSS and TSS covering the thorax was rest intact. After 10 days thoracic TSS was removed and grafted and we covered the thorax with Biobrane \u00d2 over the grafts again. After 10 days a second grafting was needed. Patient was discharged from the hospital 56th post-burn day. The use of Biobrane \u00d2 as a TSS after burn wound excision was satisfactory, because it enabled us to delay auto grafting until we were sure of good conditions in the wound bed. Also it proved to be a good dressing over the meshed autografts. It reduces the healing time and improved the quality of grafts.

Aim: We hypothesized that one of the most widely used anesthetic agents, propofol, may reduce inflammatory processes, and organ injury induced with cecal and ligation puncture Study design: Bacterial peritonitis was induced in 18 rats by cecal ligation and puncture. The rats were randomly assigned to three groups. Group 1 (n = 6) received propofol, group 2 (n = 6) received intralipid, group 3 (n = 6) was control, which did not receive any injection. All animals were killed 14 days later so we could assess the adhesion score. Tissue antioxidant levels were measured in 1-g tissue samples taken from the abdominal wall. Results: The adhesion score was significantly lower in the propofol group than in the control group (P < 0.05). The catalase levels were higher in the intralipid and control groups than the propofol groups. Conclusions: Intraperitoneal propofol reduced the formation of postoperative intra-abdominal adhesions without compromising wound healing in this bacterial peritonitis rat model. Propofol also decreased the oxidative stress during peritonitis Approximately, 20 min after the onset of the operation, a sudden decrease in end-tidal carbon dioxide from 32 to 11 mmHg was noticed. Soon after, both systolic arterial pressure and heart rate decreased dramatically. Arterial blood gas measurements showed that pCO 2 was 41 mmHg at that moment. Surgery and insufflation of gas was stopped, ephedrine 5 mg was given intravenously and ventilation with 100% O 2 was started. Trendelenburg position was achieved immediately. A catheter was introduced through the right juguler vein to the right atrium rapidly and 3-4 ml gas bubble was withdrawn. Soon, hemodynamic measures were recovered.

D-xylose was found to be 102.7 \u00b1 33.1 mg/dl. In the second group, proliferation, of mainly E. coli, were detected on cultures and D-xylose was found to be 151.0 \u00b1 37.9 mg/dl. Statistically significant increases were assigned between groups, between tissue and blood cultures (p < 0.001) and D-xylose values (p < 0.007). Results: Detecting statistically significant increases in D-xylose levels in the second group leads to the conclusion that increases in bowel permeability plays an important role in bacterial translocation.

Computed Tomography (CT) has become the mainstream of evaluating all hemodynamically stable patients with acute problems when the attending doctor, is urging for diagnosis. Basing a diagnosis solely on radiological data sometimes ignoring medical history and physical examination may lead to unexpected errors. Wrong interpretation of radiological images or images with equivocal findings which may delude the radiologist and technical errors (artifacts) are all potential sources of mistakes. The aim of this study is to draw attention to the danger of the modern imaging diagnostic modalities to misguide the treatment of patients who need emergency care. We present some cases we faced in our clinic where radiological images showed pathologic entities which in fact did not exist (false positive errors) but forced us to inappropriate treatment. Two patients underwent negative laparatomies with imaging diagnosis of a ruptured gallbladder in one case and free air under the diaphragm in the other. A patient with a severe head injury and a CT scanning showing pneumocephalous was transferred to a tertiary centre to be proved on repeated images that initial diagnosis was mistaken due to a wrong calibration of the gantry. Imaging findings do not necessarily represent reality. Almost always surgeons rely on CT scans for treatment decisions. it is a hard task for a surgeon to question or ignore the pictures to treat a patient based on medical history and physical examination.

The hydatid cysts may rupture spontaneously or as a result of trauma. Herein, we describe a rare case of retrovesical hydatid cyst which was resulted from rupture of spontaneous rupture of liver hydatic cyst intraperitoneally. Case: Fifty-four years old male was admitted to emergency department with complaints of frequent urination and abdominal pain lasting for 10 days. There was general abdominal tenderness on physical examination. There was no history of trauma or operation. In his abdominal ultrasonography and tomography there were primary cyst (11 \u00b7 6 cm), ruptured cyst (6 \u00b7 4 cm) and retrovesically located cyst (15 \u00b7 13 cm). Indirect hemagglutination test was positive for echinococcus granulosus (1/4,096) . Laparotomy was performed and all the cysts were excised by partial cystectomy. There was no postoperative complication. The patient was externalized on postoperative 5th day with albendazol treatment. Conclusion: Retrovesical localization of hydatic cyst is a very rare. These cysts mostly occur as a result of surgical inoculation caused by inadequate surgery or free intraperitoneal rupture of primary hydatic cyst. In endemic regions, possibility of hydatic cyst should be kept in mind in differential diagnosis of intrapelvic cysts and masses. Background: Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis of unknown etiology characterized mainly by involvement of the upper airways, lungs, kidneys and may rarely involve the gastrointestinal tract. Intestinal involvement may be asymptomatic. We herein report a WG with massive lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage due to colonic involvement. Case: The patient complained of dyspnea which started 2 months ago, fatigue, generalized arthralgia and myalgia together with loss of sensation on right upper extremity was applied to emergency and hospitalized by internal medicine department. Physical examination revealed a very ill-looking patient, there were positive lung findings for WG and c-ANCA was positive. We consulted the patient because of hematochesia with abrupt drop of hemoglobin and platelet count. On colonoscopy whole mucosa was full with fresh blood from sigmoid to anal canal. On angiography multiple foci of bleeding were demonstrated on descending and sigmoid colon. Embolectomy was not performed because of multiple foci. hemoglobin decrease continued and his clinical condition deteriorated; an explorative laparotomy and total left colectomy was performed. His melena persisted for 34 days but hemoglobin was maintained at 9 after 8 units transfusion after operation. Conclusion: We herein report a case with clinical WG who developed a gastrointestinal hemorrhage and treated by surgery.

Methods: 58 patients who underwent cholecystectomy for acute biliary pancreatitis in our clinic between 2004 and 2009 were evaluated retrospectively. The patients were divided into three groups as early, late and elective cholecystectomy cases. F\u0131nd\u0131ngs: 20 patients who had undergone cholecystectomy operation in the first 10 days until the administration to hospital were classified as the first group (early cholecystectomy). 12 patients who had undergone cholecystectomy between the 2nd and 10th weeks until the administration to hospital were classified as the second group (late cholecystectomy). 26 patients who had undergone cholecystectomy after 10 weeks were classified as the third group (elective cholecystectomy). In Group 2, no patient had pancreatitis attacks; 8 of 26 patients in Group 3 had recurrent pancreatitis attack in the preoperative period and treated in our clinic. In order of these data, age, height, weight, gender, SGOT, SGPT, amylase, bilirubin and the time for waiting for the operation were compared and evaluated statistically. The time for waiting for the operation was found to be p > 0.001, and it was shown to be significant. Results: There is a tendency to perform cholecystectomy in patients with acute biliary pancreatitis, after the acute attack is resolved. We believe that the early cholecystectomy prevents the patient from the additional morbidity in patients with acute biliary pancreatitis, by showing this with a statistically significant result in our study. Traumatic right sided diaphragmatic hernia is clinically rare and may present with complications in a later period. On the right side presence of liver is thought to be a protective factor for both development of diaphragmatic injury itself and for its complications. We present a case of right sided diaphragmatic hernia due to blunt trauma, which was asymptomatic for 57 years and has been presented with intestinal obstruction. The patient, 76 years of male, has presented with intestinal obstruction and abdominal pain which has been relieved after nasogastric decompression. Despite conservative treatment patient has not shown further improvement and has been operated on a semi-elective basis. Significant part of small and large bowel, distal portion of stomach, and almost whole of liver had been herniated and reduced by right thoracoabdominal approach. 10 cm wide defect in diaphragm has been repaired with prolene mesh, laparotomy has not been closed and Bogota bag has been applied.

Blunt thoracic trauma leads to various clinical conditions, such as hemothorax, pneumothorax, pulmonary contusion, and respiratory tract hemorrhage. Especially, respiratory tract hemorrhage resulting from pulmonary contusion is so critical to require a clinical challenge. Of our experienced survivors, 3 trauma victims (male 3/3, 19-23 years old) with blunt thoracic trauma associated with motorcycle accident were transferred to our emergency departments. They similarly suffered respiratory failure (average respiratory rate of 32) and hypotension (average shock index of 1.2) on arrival. Immediate after the rapid-developing respiratory failure in relation to lung contusion and endobronchial bleeding, bronchial blockade device and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were urgently introduced at an average of 32 and 104 min, respectively, and achieved rapid resolution of their respiratory crisis. All of them withdraw from ECMO within 5 days. Pulmonary contusion sometimes follows fatal progress, and we consider that quick bronchus blockade and ECMO introduction is the key of survival. Emergency departments (ED) in Greece are incorporated to the departments of the hospital and are divided in two major areas: one for internal medicine and one for general surgery.

Author to editor: Saved by LookUs Introduction: An association between the administration of paracetamol and relative hypotension in critically ill patients has been reported by the staff working in the surgical and trauma intensive care unit of Istanbul Faculty of Medicine. Methods: A prospective, observational study was undertaken to investigate the effect of paracetamol on systemic blood pressure in two groups of critically ill patients. A dose of 500 mg of paracetamol was administered intravenously to both groups in 15 min time. Blood pressure, heart rate were recorded at baseline, at the end of infusion and then at 15, 30, 60 min after administration. The differences occured over the observation period was measured by Friedman analyse. Results: Twenty-eight patients with sepsis, were enrolled to group-1 (anti-pyretic effect) and 20 postoperative patients were enrolled to group-2 (analgesic effect). Analysis of data from all patients showed that systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were reduced significantly over the observation period in both groups (SAP:p < 0.001 for both, MAP:group-1 p < 0.05, group-2 p < 0.001). SAP and MAP in group-1 and group-2 decreased by an average of approximately 7 and 10% respectively. However, no significant decrease in DAP was noted in group-1. Conclusions: Utilization of the intravenous paracetamol for febrile and/or postoperative patients caused a significant decrease in systemic blood pressure after administration. This drug-induced hypotension was clinically relevant to control the required blood pressure.

Background: Electrical injuries are related with multiple organ dysfunction as well as high morbidity and mortality. Pulmonary compromise is rare, if compared to other organ dysfunctions related with electrical injuries. In this study, we presented a case with pulmonary hemorrhage associated with electrical injury. Case: A 24-year-old previously health man was brought to our Emergency Department (ED), 1 h following the accident, with electrical injury. Initial examination findings were blood pressure 80/ 40 mmHg, heart rate 79/min, respiratory rate 37 breath /min. Glasgow coma score was 3. Decreased breath sounds, bilateral rales and wheezing were determined. There were small necrotic wounds (typical contact injury) on the first finger of left hand and under the right foot of patient. There was no trauma in thoracic wall. Blood gas analysis revealed respiratory and metabolic acidosis. The INR and platelet levels were normal. When chest radiograph and thoracic computed tomography were assessed, air bronchograms and symmetric consolidations were determined in the both lungs. Patient was intubated and fresh blood was aspirated from endotracheal tube. Mechanical ventilatory support was performed the patient due to lung hemorrhage and respiratory failure. Patient died after 4 h of admission in the ED. Conclusion: Multiple organ dysfunction and necrotic skin lesions could be occurred in electrical injuries. Electrical injuries on the chest may cause lung infarction because of the direct effect of the electrical current and vascular embolism.

Methods: Two cases over 40%, 2nd and 3rd degree burn injury admitted to our facility. First case who was 9 year old female developed S. aureus and second case was 18 years old female developed P. aeruginosa sepsis which was confirmed by blood culture. In first case DIC developed at postburn 18 day and in second case at postburn 26 day. In both cases DIC developed after postsurgery day 7. Results: On patients, bleeding points, as leaking, were detected on all over burn areas. At the same period thrombocyte values decreased sharply (88.9 K/UL). Increase in prothrombin time (PT) (38.2 second) and active partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) (108 second) values, decrease in fibrinogen levels was observed. Cases were discharged from hospital in 35th day, without any problem. Patient was taken for 9 IU erythrocyte suspension and 6 IU platelet suspension in this time totally. Conclusion: DIC occurs in early period of burning; but it can be formed in later periods, even after defects were recovered by operation. Rapid establishment of DIC table just before the discharging term from hospital is an unusual and interesting situation. The patients in our study can be accepted as an example of the necessity of observing coagulation parameters in every periods of burn damage.

It can include lifethreatened various reasons as cardiac, respiratory, and serious gastrointestinal problems, rarely. Case: A 47 year old man had an emesis with recurrent epigastric and left upper caudran pain admitted as second turn to ED in 24 h. Physical examination except a slight epigastric sensitiveness, EKG, urine test and biochemical tests, complet abdominal ultrasonography, X-rays were nonspesific on the first day. WBC was 12.2 on CBC. His complaints relieved with semptomatic treatment with an 50 mg ranitidine, 10 mg metoclopramide, serum sale on his observation and discharged with suggestions. In second admission with nonspecific physical examination findings, computerized tomography (CT) revealed splenic unenhanced parenchymal areas consistent with splenic infarcts. Computerized tomography angiography (CTA) showed a small aneurysm of the celiac trunk, a characteristic pattern of caliber irregularities and arterial wall thickening of the splanchnic arteriesincluding splenic artery, common hepatic, right and left hepatic arteries-, suggesting splanchnic arterial mediolysis (Figures 1 and 2 are presented with permission of patient's written consent). He was hospitalized to general surgery and started low molecular weight heparin. As clinical and radiologic findings were degrated, he was discharged without an operation. Conclusions: Splanchnic (segmental) arterial mediolysis is a rare noninflammatory vascular disease of the abdominal splanchnic arteries with slight symptoms. CT for vasculary and internal organs should be performed to diagnose in recurrent complaints beside observing the physical findings. Introduction: It is well documented that healing of peptic ulcer perforation (PUP) is possible with conservative therapy in selected cases.

This is the first case of gastric hamartoma which is coexistent with duodenal ulcer perforation. Case: A 59-year old male admitted to our hospital with complaints of stomach ache, nausea and vomitting. Because there was free air under right subdiaphragmatic surface on chest X-ray, an emergency operation was performed. There was a perforated ulcer on the first part of duodenum and a large quantity of bile mixed with blood in the abdominal cavity. On further exploration a tumoral mass which was about 3 cm in diameter was found on the stomach corpus. Because of possibility of malignancy, a subtotal gastrectomy including the perforation zone was performed. Histologically the tumor was well circumscribed and it consisted of uniform, clear cells.

Case 1: An 86-years-old man presented with a 20 years history of bilateral inguinal mass. Ultrasound examination described a hernia which contains mobile bowel segments inside, on the right side. The appendix was obsereved edematous and hyperemic in the hernial sac. An appendicectomy was done. Further exploration of the bowels revealed a meckel diverticulitis which was managed by a wedge resection.

Discussion: Acute appendicitis or perforation of the appendix within the hernia sac simulates perforation of the intestine, and does not have specific symptoms or signs. Preoperative clinical diagnosis is very difficult and the diagnosis is made intraoperatively. Since the absence of any pathognomonic radiological features, the value of preoperative computed tomography is limited. Treatment of hernial appendicitis is an appendicectomy with suture hernial repair. The management of a non-inflamed appendix is debatable.

Methods: The arcuate foramen is an anatomical variant of the atlas vertebra: anterior and posterior osseous bridges or ponticles can arch over the vertebral artery, to a greater or lesser degree, transforming the arterial groove into a canal. Dissection of the vertebral artery leading to thrombotic occlusion or ischaemia from narrowing of the arterial lumen has been described in trauma. There are fistula between a dural branch of the spinal ramus of a radicular artery and an intradural medullary vein in spinal vascular malformations. MDCT angiography is feasible and is an alternative technique in diagnosis spinal vask\u00fc ler malformations. The craniovertebral junction (CVJ) is a funnel-shaped structure comprised of the clivus and foramen magnum and the upper two cervical vertebrae.

His medical history revealed a laparoscopic appendectomy 6 months ago. He emphasized that his complaints started shortly after the operation and increasingly got worse. He was admitted to hospital 3 days after operation with symptoms of ileus and managed conservatively. The intermittant abdominal pain and nausea continued. Since the pain was intensified after meals, patient refused eating. During the period of 6 months he lost 20 kg of weight. After numerous radiological and endoscopic investigations patient was referred to psychiatry due to persistent anorexia. After short psychiatric medication, he was referred to our surgical unit. Multislice abdominal computerized tomography and and enteroclysis of small bowel clearly demonstrated an obstruction in the jejunal segment of the intestine. At laparotomy, small bowel obstruction was detected and segmental resection was performed. Postoperative period was uneventful and patient was discharged from hospital on postoperative day 6. Conclusions: The diagnosis of anorexia and nausea due to SBO is relatively difficult. The patients were sometimes misdiagndosed as having psychiatric disease. Before starting psychiatric medication, they must be reevaluated for all putative causes of SBO. Introduction: Endoscopically placed biliary stents are a well-established procedure for the treatment of benign and malignant biliary disease.

In this study, we analysed the demographic and clinic characteristics of the patients who admitted to emergency service due to tick bite. Methods: In this study, patients were selected from cases of tick bite admitted to the department of emergency medicine of Ankara Numune Hospital during the 2007-2008 periods. Detailed histories and some blood tests of patients were taken, and the body of the tick grasped gently avoiding to inject more salivary toxins. Results: Totally 301 patients admitted to hospital in this period. The most frequent symptoms at administration were malaise, myalgia, and fatigue. Hemorrhagic manifestations were observed in 28 patients and bleeding was from multiple sites in 15 patients. Other symptoms were watery diarrhoea, skin eruption, macular rash, and petechia-ecchymosis. In the comparison of the clinical features and laboratory results of the surviving and the patients who died, we found that the rates of fever during hospitalization, confusion, neck stiffness, bleeding from multiple sites and presence of petechia/ecchymosis were higher in the patients who died than in the surviving ones. Additionally, the mean values of ALT, AST, LHD, CK, PTT, international normalized ratio (INR), and urea were also higher and mean PLT counts were lower in the patients who died. Conclusion: The acute tick-bite reactions show special histologic features, which are unquestionably related to the particular morphology and physiology of the mouthparts of these arthropods. Results: Totally 46 patients (33 men and 13 women) were evaluated. The mean age was 55.7 (20-97) years and the mean follow up period was 38 (7-68) months. The localization of the hernias were as follows: 33 inguinal hernias, seven femoral hernias, two umblical hernias, two paraumblical hernias, one epigastric hernia and one inguinal + femoral hernia. All of these strangulated hernias were treated with prosthetic graft repairing. In addition to these hernia repairs, in the same operation sessions three hydrocele repairs, three omentum resections, two partial small intestine resection and anastomosis, one lymphadenectomy, one orchiectomy and one laparotomy were done when necessary. In the early post operative period four patients died because of other diseases not related with the surgical procedures or hernia itself. Wound infections were observed in three patients and they were treated with antibiotics and anti inflammatory drugs. We report a rare case of ileal perforation caused by an ingested 15cm long fork. A 43-year-old man presented to the emergency department with exhaustion, weight loss and abdominal pain. He had been having pain in the abdomen, nausea and vomiting for the previous 2 days. The patient had received psychiatric treatment, and started to experience weight loss and exhaustion 3-4 months previously. No conclusions could be drawn from physical examination for abdominal tenderness and defence. Direct X-ray showed an appearance conforming to a fork in the intestine and subdiaphragmatic free gas. The patient was sent for emergency surgery, with a diagnosis of ileal perforation and foreign-body ingestion. Most of the ingested foreign bodies that reach the stomach pass through the alimentary tract without complication. Perforation occurs in, 1% of all cases of foreign-body ingestion, usually in the oesophagus. Other sites where perforation can occur are the pylorus, the duodenum, the duodenojejunal flexure, the ileocaecal region and any site of congenital anomalies. Long, thin or sharp objects, as seen in our case causing ileal perforation. Foreign-body ingestion is a possibility to be borne in mind at presentations to the emergency department, especially those with symptoms described in psychiatric cases. Appendicectomy is a common emergency operation, its major complications are uncommon. Most complications of appendicectomy occur in the early postoperative period and easy amenable to treatment with conservative medical therapy. Appendicitis, usually a benign disease, can have its prognosis worsened in case of postoperative fistula. The latter occurs rarely after open appendicectomy but accounts for 10% of the morbidity rate.

Methods: Retrospective study of all patients admitted to the Trauma and Emergency Surgery Intensive Care Unit (ICU) from January 2005 through December 2008 with TBI. Criteria for TBI-coagulopathy (TBI-C) included a clinical condition consistent with coagulopathy in conjunction with a platelet count < 100,000 mm3 and/or international normalized ratio (INR) > 1.2 and/or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) > 29 s and/or prothrombin time (PT) > 14.5 s. The following potential risk factors were included to identify independent risk factors for TBI-C and its association with mortality, age, mechanism of injury (blunt (B) or penetrating (P)), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Injury Severity Scale (ISS), presence of polytrauma, ICU length of stay (ICU-LOS). Results: A total of 82 patients met study criteria. TBI-C occured in 86.5% (n: 71) of all patients (B: 66.1%, P: 33.9%). In patients with TBI-C, mean age was 36.42 \u00b1 17.03 years. The averages of GCS was 7.9 \u00b1 2.74, ISS was 33.14 \u00b1 14.12, ICU-LOS was 11.51 \u00b1 6.77 days, polytrauma was considered 57.7% (n:41) and the overall mortality was 21.1%(n: 15) in patients with TBI-C. Conclusions: In our study, TBI-C occured more frequently among patients sustaining blunt versus penetrating injuries. To our knowledge, TBI patients are at considerable risk of developing coagulopathy and anesthesiologists should be aware of this life-threatening syndrome, especially in TBI patients with blunt injuries. Erythropoietin (EPO), glycoprotein hormone, is a mainly produced by the kidney that stimulates proliferation, growth and differentiation of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow. Recently, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, antiapopitotic, angiogenic and vasodilatator effects of EPO have been also determinated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of rHuEPO in reducing the severity of experimental spinal cord injury (SCI). Ninety adult Sprague-Dowley rats weighted 200 g (\u00b1 15) were used for the study. Through a dorsal incision, T6-9 laminectomies performed in prone position and clip compression had made for ischemic injury as Tator method. The rats divided in three groups. Systemic 200 l (1,000 U/kg) rHuEPO had given 24 h before the trauma in the first group, 30 min. later after the injury in the second group and the third was the control group. The rats were killed with high dose intraperitoneal ketamin 24 h later after the injury. The histological examination of injured spinal cord specimens for the potential neuroprotective effects of rHuEPO was done. Further more the axial spine sections stained with TTC (triphenyl tetrazolium chloride). The ischemic areas were evaluated with a imaging calculation program. We use wet-dry method for determination of ischemic tissue edema. We concluded that administrating a single dose rHuEPO (1,000 U/ kg) has potential neuroprotective effect on experimental spine injury by reducing severity of inflammation and tissue edema in the secondary ischemic area. It has known both early surgery and high dose steroid treatment prevents the neurological function and viability caused of the traumatic secondary spine injury. We present surgically treated a traumatic rotation-compression spinal cord injury caused by a motor vehicle accident. The patient referred to our clinic 45 h after the injury. At the time of admission, he had a localized pain at the thoracic 10-11 vertebrae level, loss motor and sensorial function under the level T10 classified as ASIA grade A. He was incontinent. In the radiological evaluation we found loss of height at the thoracic 10th and 11th vertebrae body, serious spinal column injury include T10-11 burst fracture, laminas and facet joints fractures with three colon damage (Denis F). We detected the spinal instability criteria in . We did not see penetrating injury or primary spinal cord injury signs but spinal canal tightness for 30 percent in CT and MRI scans. We took the patient to surgery in unusual classical surgery timing. First, decompressing surgery applied to the T10-11 laminas and posterior stabilization with transpedicular screw-rot system. One day after the first operation, T10 and T11 corpectomy applied for anterior stabilization with cage-screw system. Mega dose steroid had given also before the first surgery. Postoperatively early neurological evaluation, he had ASIA grade C, after second month ASIA grade D without incontinence. In our opinion the decompressing surgery that applied in 48 h in the patients without complete primary spine injury, has a positive neurological feedback. Introduction: It is a rare occurrence with the rate of 1% in the subjects with spinal infestation cyst hydatic Echinococcus granulosus. Intradural hydatic cyst is relatively rare when compared with other spinal hydatic cysts. We are presenting here a 68-year-old female case who applied to emergency service with backache and paralysed legs and was diagnosed with spinal intradural extramedullary hydatic cyst.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "ICU"}, {"text": "Case: A 68-year-old female patient applied to emergency service with complaints of a backache started two days ago, paralyses in both legs and being unable to walk.

In the torako-lomber spinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), multiple cystic characterized nodular lesions having peripheral contrast with regular contour including right neural foramen and paravertebral zone at the level of T11-T12 and L1 in the intradural distance were determined. The patient was diagnosed with common spinal intradural extramedullary hydatic cyst exhibiting bone involvement. As the lesion was very broad had paraplegia, we did not consider operation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "ICU"}, {"text": "Conclusions: Hydatic cyst infestation is a benign disease. If it is not diagnosed early and treated when it involves in some systems rarely as it did in this study, the results can be serious. Diagnosis should be confirmed quickly with increasingly common advanced radiological diagnosis methods. The aim in these cases is to eradicate the cysts surgically, however, chemo-therapy and percutaneous drain methods have become more significant recently. Introduct\u0131on: Several guidelines advocate multiple chest radiographs during primary resuscitation of trauma patients. Several local hospital protocols include a repeat radiograph before leaving the trauma resuscitation room (TR). The purpose of this study was to determine the value of routine repeat radiograph. Methods: One year data of all radiological imaging in our TR were prospectively collected for all patients presented to the TR of the hospital. We counted and assessed the radiographs and classified our findings as either 'new injury detected', 'presence of intervention equipment', or 'deterioration of previously detected injury'. Results: In total, 674 patients were included. More than 75% had two radiographs. Eight (2.1%) new injuries without clinical relevance were found on the repeat radiograph after an initial normal radiograph. In total 61 patients (9%), had a repeat radiograph to verify the effect of an intervention or position of equipment. In 28 patients (22%) with two abnormal radiographs, newly diagnosed injuries (n = 9) or deterioration of known injuries (n = 19) were found. In 411 patients (81%) the results of the repeat radiograph had no clinical consequences. Conclus\u0131on: Our study supports a strategy of omitting a routine repeat radiograph in trauma patients whose initial radiograph is normal. Introduction and objective: The neck region is affected in only about 5-10% of all trauma cases, and isolated neck injuries, especially from a blunt mechanism, is even more rare. Our objective was to assess the incidence, disability from spinal cord injuries, and preventable deaths in our patients with isolated neck trauma. Material and methods: Patients were identified at the Severe Trauma Registry of our hospital, between 1993 and 2006. The TRISS method was used to assess preventable deaths. Results: We found 117 (7.4%) patients with neck injuries out of 1.575 patients included in our registry, 70 (60%) from blunt (BNT) and 47 (40%) from penetrating trauma (PNT). Only 9 (13%) BNT and 19 (40%) PNT were isolated. The mean ISS of the BNT and PNT groups was of 25 \u00b1 7 and 14 \u00b1 9.5, respectively.

However about applications increased gradually with a peak at 17 o'clock in all groups. Patients treated at ED were mostly stricken (58.5%) and the busy period was between 12-24 h with two peaks at 17 and 22 o'clock. Totally, 231 patients were hospitalized mostly in group III (48.9%) regardless of cause (p < 0.01). Patients referred to another hospital were frequently in group III (39.9%) and also in group IV (32.3%). Mortality was slightly high in group III. However higher rate (1.1%) was seen among patients in group II. Conclusion: Midnight hours seemed safe in terms of mortality and severity of trauma. Whether the reason for a higher transportation rate at night hours is the severity of trauma or sedation of ED staff is not clear. Introduct\u0131on: In this study we aimed to investigate and compare the features of child and adult injuries due to bicycle accidents admitted to our emergency department. Patients and Methods: The study was carried out retrospectively by searching the files of patients admitted to the emergency department due to bicycle accidents, in the emergency department and archive records between the dates of January 2005 and December 2008. The patients were divided into two groups as adults and children. Age and sex of patients, season or month of injuries, place and mechanism of injury, injury site of the body, diagnosis and treatment modalities, discharge and hospitalization rates were evaluated. Results: Totally 150 patients were included in the study. 79% of the patients were in child age group, 21% were adults. It was determined that number of accidents increased especially in the summer months. 71.4% of accidents concerning children and all of adult accidents occurred in the streets. Falling down from the bicycle was the most common injury mechanism in children (91%) and adults (90%). Head and neck region was the most common body site subjected to the injury both in children (32%) and adults (40%). 78% of child patients and 84% of adult patients were discharged after emergency department follow up and treatment. There was a significant difference between two groups with respect to injury severity. Conclus\u0131on: As a conclusion most of the injuries due to bicycle accidents happen in children, in the streets, in summer months and school vacations.

Hence, helicopters are effectively used by the military although they are austere environments that offer limited space, equipment and resources for the crew and requires higher level of skills for prehospital trauma care. Mater\u0131al-Method: The data were collected from 60 consequent casualties, by the helicopter medical team (a surgeon, anesthesiology technician and a paramedic). During the flight, we triaged the casualties according to wound characteristics (severity, mechanism, location), physiological parameters, and provided basic life support stated by trauma resuscitation course (TRK). We transmitted these findings to the military trauma center to provide hospital preparedness. Result: Injury mechanisms were 70% explosives and 30% highvelocity weapons. Time to hospital admittance was < 50 min after the injury. Most frequent sites of injury (AIS 1-5) were extremities (75%) and thorax (38.3%); the frequency of \u2021 2 anatomical site injury was 35%. Capillary refill rates were; < 2 seconds 74.3%, > 2 seconds 25.7%. Mean SaO2, GCS, HR, Respiratory Rate values were 97.2 \u00b1 3.2, 14.1 \u00b1 2.34, 87.6 \u00b1 20.5, 17.5 \u00b1 3.1, respectively. During uninterrupted care, 6 (10%) intubations were performed and 67% of casualties were operated upon admittance without any onboard mortalities. Conclusion: The high energy and lethality of the wounding agents in combat render the helicopter evacuations indispensible. Additionally, civilian major trauma patients may benefit from expeditious transport to the closest trauma centers or from rural inaccessible areas within the 'golden hour of trauma'. The most important steps for the treatment of the combat injury causalities are to stop or reduce bleeding and to start fluid resuscitation. Peripheral intravenous (iv) line placement is one of the most important procedure in the battlefield conditions. Most of the time, fluid resuscitation would be the only available medical treatment for the injured combatant because of the prolonged evacuation period in the battlefield. Also, this procedure would be very difficult and time consuming especially under hostile gunfire.

It would be proper to study the issue of work anxiety by obtaining psychological support, and to cooperate with the actors in this sector to develop solutions. It is concluded that further studies should be conducted on work anxiety and its reasons. In general, emergency patients should be transported to the closest appropriate hospital. If the emergency medical services have identified a specific hospital with better resources to treat seriously injured patients, the patient should be transported to that institution, bypassing closer hospitals. The cooperation is expected between the hospitals, and the development of formal transfer agreements, describing all of the legal, economic, and medical aspects of the relationship are encouraged. Ideally, the entire trauma system in a city should be designed on the basis of need and existing resources, with all affected parties involved in the planning, development, and implementation. The goal of the system is to match the needs of an injured patient to the resources of the available facilities so that optimal and cost-effective care is achieved. We conduct six essential questions for the preparation of trauma. Is there a legal authority to formally designate hospital's trauma response in your city? What sources were used as a basis for standards of the trauma response in your service area? Were the number of hospitals identified for your service area limited based on the results of needs assessment? What type of transport practice occurs in your service area when a field assessment identifies a trauma patient with severe injuries that threaten loss of life or limb? Is a trauma registry present in your service area? Is there a designated trauma advisory committee that evaluates the performance of trauma care delivery within your service area? We evaluated the role of primary hip arthroplasty (consisting of both total hip replacements and hemiarthroplasty) in these comminuted, osteoporotic or neglected fractures. These patients at-risk were in need of a single definitive surgical plan for early ambulation and preventing complications. Typically these patients were elderly with poor mobility and had multiple other medical condition to be able to withstand multiple surgeries. There was a need to obtain the best results with the single, rapid procedure for pain relief and early ambulation. Excellent to very good results were obtained in about 77% of these patients. Good results were obtained in about 19% of these patients and poor results in about 4%. Most of the poor results were the outcomes of complicated medical conditions rather than the failure of the orthopaedic procedure itself. We advocate arthroplasty in neglected, osteoporotic or severely comminuted per-trochanteric fractures for immediate mobilization and optimising outcomes. The role of intra-articular steroids or hyaluronic acid injections in early arthritis may be warranted and perhaps safe. But for patients waiting for a knee replacement these can prove positively dangerous. A meta-analysis has revealed that intra-articular injections given in patients waiting for a knee replacement procedure is fraught with dangers. Apart from a high risk of post-operative infection and failure of the procedure, several other side-effects or complications make this risky. There is a higher-than-average chance of quadriceps tendon rupture, delayed wound healing, superficial infections and slower rehabilitation. In comparison hyaluronic injections have been found efficacious in the short term and do not contribute to complications normally attributed to steroids. Thus intra-articular injections should be used with caution, repeated injections are best avoided and are certainly contraindicated if a procedure is anticipated to be performed within six months. Introduction: Pediatric forearm fractures are common. The majority has satisfactory outcome. But poor results do occur and malunion can compromise rotation. We belief that the angulation of the fracture depends on the action of the body and that we can reduce the fracture by completing the action. This way we can perceive a stable anatomic reduction without internal fixation. Methods: We undertook a prospective study of distal forearm fractures in children. We included 21 children with a non-displaced angulated metaphyseal distal forearm fracture. The angulation was between 15\u00b0and 42\u00b0.We all reduced them by completing the action of the body. This means a volar angulated fracture is reduced by pronation of the hand and a dorsal angulated fracture is reduced by supination. After the reduction they were casted in an upper-arm cast in pronation or supination depending of the reduction manoeuvre. Afterwards the all received 3 weeks of upper-arm cast and 3 weeks of lower-arm cast.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "National Medical Rescue Team"}, {"text": "Results: They all healed without loss of reduction and without further treatment.

Background: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays an important role in the bone repair process as a potent mediator of angiogenesis and influences directly the osteoblast differentiation. Inhibiting VEGF suppresses angiogenesis and callus mineralization in animals. However, no data exist on systemic expression of VEGF with regard to delayed or failed fracture healing in humans so far. Methods: One hundred fourteen patients with long bone fractures were included into the study. Serum samples were collected over a period of 6 months following a standardized time schedule. VEGF serum concentrations were measured. Patients were assigned to 2 groups according to their course of fracture healing. The first group contained 103 patients with physiological fracture healing. Eleven patients with delayed-or non-unions formed the second group of the study. In addition, 33 healthy volunteers served as controls.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "National Medical Rescue Team"}, {"text": "Results: An increase of VEGF serum concentration within the first 2 weeks after fracture in both groups with a following decrease within 6 months after trauma was observed.

First, DSBLS is applied to 2.5 cm proximal to most prominent point of medial malleol of tibia. The DSBLS was inserted parallel to the joint surface in frontal and horizontal plane. After the DSBLS is applied the selected nail is inserted. Reamed IMN is used for the tibias with narrow isthmus (6). The success of DI is checked following the insertion of nail with set screw on the DSLBS. The unsuccessful attempts are repeated after the reason is removed. The DI of 36 tibias were successful and 4 were unsuccessful at the first attempt. In unsuccessful cases, the nails were at the posterior (2), anterior (1) and lateral (1) Collum femoris fractures accounts 4.5-5% of all fractures. However it is very rare in children (1%). In this study we evaluated 12 pediatric patients who were operated due to collum femoris fracture in terms of avascular necrosis and functional outcome. Age of the patients ranged from 3 to 14. There were seven girls and five boys. Two of the patients were admitted to the emergency department due to a fall from height, therefore they had multi system trauma. The remaining ten patients had isolated collum femoris fracture. Fractures was classified according to Delbet classificaion; seven transcervical and five cervicothrochanteric. Locking plate-screw fixation was applied to one patient, other fractures were fixed with two or three cannulated screws. Open reduction was applied to four patients and closed reduction to eight. Five of the cases were operated in the first 24 h of the fracture, however the remaining seven patients were operated after the first 24 h (2-10 days) due to late admission. Range of motion of the hip joint was limited in only one patient who had polytrauma and operated after the first 24 h. There were three avascular necrosis as acomplication. All of them operated after the first 24 h and all the fracture types were cervicotrochanteric. Open reduction was applied to two patients and closed reduction to one. Pediatric collum femoris fractures are rarely seen in children but treatment is challenging and open to complications. Fracture type, surgical methods, did not effect the outcome, but timing of surgery did. Author to editor: In this study we discussed the outcome of pediatric collum femoris fractures, which is a very rare fracture in orthopaedic experience. Surgical management of humerus shaft fractures is an increasing interest nowadays. We want to discuss the outcome of conservative, open reduction and internal plate fixation (OR _ IF) and intramedullary nailing (IMN) methods in adults (22-80 years old). 10 patients had conservative treatment with modified custom made Sarmiento brace and 9 of them had union with 5\u00b0-20\u00b0of malunion. None of the nine have complains and the avarage union duration is 10 weeks (8-12). One patients did not tolerate bracing and undergone surgery. 14 Patients had OR _ IF and 2 had gone second operation for nonunion and 4 had elonged wound drainage. All the fractures healed eventually with in 10 weeks (6-16). No neurovascular complication was observed. 18 Patients had IMN treatment and 4 had delayed union up to 6 months, 2 had undergone reoperation with OR _ IF for non-union, 1 had intraoperative fracture of elbow and 6 had shoulder problems with impingement and rotatory cuff problems. Avarage union duration was found 9 weeks (7-12). Surgical treatment is getting more popular for long bones nowadays. Early return of work and social life, anatomic reduction, using no sling or such devices and easy follow up protocols are the facts that popularising the surgical management. But in our series, we had seen multiple types complications that are as high as they are mentioned in literature. With the experience of those 42 patients that had been treated with in this year, conservative treatment methods have to be conserned firstly in suitable and tolerable patients for us. Intoduction and Objectives: Correction of sagittal deformity is important in thoracolumbar burst fractures. The clinical maneuvers needed for reduction and the assessment of correction of the fractured vertebra is not well described. In this prospective series we used the length of the interspinous ligaments as reduction parameter. Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of this assessment technique in achieving good correction. Methods: From 1999 to 2005 25 patients (M/F 14/11, mean age 34.7) with unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures were treated by posterior fusion with a standard construct by a single surgeon. All patients were treated with segmental posterior instrumentation with two levels above and two levels below the fracture level fixation by means of pre-contoured rods and distraction technique. With these maneuvers the length of the injured level was tried to be equalized to the mean of upper and lower levels. Anterior column was assessed by radioscopy. Preoperative and postoperative radiographs were analyzed and local kyphosis (LK), Farcy's sagittal index (FSI) and compression percentage (CP) were measured. Results: The preoperative LK decreased from 18.96\u00b0to 3.44\u00b0, FSI decreased from 18.2\u00b0to 3.8\u00b0and CP decreased from 28 to 46.8. After a minimum follow-up time of 2 years all patients continue to do well with no statistically significant decrease in these parameters. Conclusions: Assessment of thoracolumbar burst fracture reduction with pre-contoured rods and distraction technique can be made safely by intraoperative measurement of the length of the interspinous ligaments. Case: An 85-year old lady was admitted in our emergency department with a Neer 3-part fracture of the right proximal humerus caused by a fall. She was operated on and received a shoulder hemiarthroplasty. During cementation of the stem the patient became bradycard and acute respiratory arrest occurred. She was resuscitated, but eventually died 9 h postoperatively. Postmortem examination revealed embolic bone marrow occluding the pulmonary capillaries. Comment: Pulmonary embolus after upper extremity surgery is a rare complication. Fatal pulmonary embolus is even more rare. When reviewing literature there is no previous case of fatal pulmonary embolus caused by fat emboli described. Fat embolism syndrome was first described by Zenker in 1861, but its frequency today is still unclear. Usually it presents as a multisystem disorder. The most often and most seriously affected organs are the lung, brain, cardiovascular system and skin. It is a self-limiting disease, therefore treatment should be mainly supportive.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "National Medical Rescue Team"}, {"text": "Purpose: Lack of knee flexion is a possible complication in severe femur fractures. Two different techniques for the treatment of this problem were applied. Mater\u0131als-Methods: From 2006 to 2008, 3 patients with severely arthrofibrotic knees were managed with two different operative techniques. The mean age of the patients at the time of the operation was 45 years. We recorded the clinical outcome of 1 patient using Judet quadricepsplasty with a follow-up of 28 months, and of two patients using extra-articular mini-invasive quadricepsplasty and intra-articular arthroscopic lysis of adhesions during the same anesthesia session with a mean follow-up of 14 months. All patients were evaluated according to the criteria of Judet and The Hospital for Special Surgery knee-rating system. Results: The average maximum degree of flexion increased from 33\u00b0p reoperatively to 65\u00b0at the time of the most recent follow-up. According to the criteria of Judet, the result was good for 2 knees, and fair for one. The average Hospital for Special Surgery knee score improved from 48 points preoperatively to 58 points at the time of the most recent follow-up. A superficial wound infection occured in one patient. Conclusions: If you select the appropriate cases, the Judet procedure and mini-invasive operation for the severely arthrofibrotic knee can be used to increase the range of motion and enhance functional outcome. Purpose: Floating Knee and Elbow injuries are complex injuries. The types of fractures, soft tissue and associated injuries make this a challenging problem to manage. We present the outcome of these injuries after surgical management. Materials and Methods: Two patients with floating knee injuries(classified by Blake and McBryde) and one patient with floating elbow injuries were managed over an average of 22 months. Both fractures of the floating knee injury and the three fractures of the elbow injury were surgically fixed using different modalities. The associated injuries were managed appropriately. Assessment of the end result used the Karlstr\u00f6 m criteria after bony union. Results: Mechanism of injury was road traffic accidents in two patients (floating knee) and falling from height for one patient (floating elbow). There were 2 associated injuries, patient 1 was TipIIA, patient 2 was TipIIB. Both these patients had intramedullary nailing for femur fractures. Patient 1 had ilizarov external fixation for segmenter tibia fractures, patient 2 had a proximal medial plate for proximal tibia fracture. Patient 3 had plates af\u0131xed to all fractures.Complications were knee stiffness and delayed union of femur in a patient (second operation required). The bony union time average from 32 weeks for femur fractures, 18 weeks for tibia, 12 weeks for upper extremities. According to the Karlstom criteria the end results was acceptable.

Within the population with primarily 3-view series 249 (35%) were repeatedly incomplete and 16 (2%) were inevaluable. In the major part of the incomplete 3-view series no apparent reason could be determined. However, the presence of clavicular fractures (resulting in incomplete radiographs in 68 vs. 43% without a fracture; p < 0.001) and rib fractures (56 vs. 34%; p = 0.008) were associated with incomplete 3-view series. Conclusion: In more than a third of the patients primarily assessed with 3-view series, the results are incomplete or inevaluable necessitating CT scanning. Therefore, the diagnostic value of 3-view series is questionable. In patients with clavicular and rib fractures 3-view series can be omitted and primary CT scanning is advised. The treatment of open distal tibia fractures is still discussed controversially and they are a great challenge for surgeons. It is still not clear if there should be initial stabilization with an external fixator or primary osteosynthesis with an intramedullary nail or plate. We retrospectively examined 20 patients with II\u00b0and IIIa\u00b0open distal tibia fractures which were treated during the last 4 years in our level one Trauma Center. We treated 16 male and 4 female patients with an average age of 31 years. Ten patients were treated with an external fixator and 10 patients were treated with an intramedullary nail or plate osteosynthesis in acute surgery. The patients, firstly treated with an external fixator, were stabilized with reamed intramedullary nailing in eight cases and with locked plating in two cases after wound closure. There was no difference in the duration until bony union in any groups. Fewer unplaned revisions (n = 3) and no deep osseous infections were found in those patients treated with an external fixator in the acute phase of the injury. Patients treated with a definitive osteosynthesis underwent unplaned revisions in six cases and developed deep osseous wound infections in four cases. We therefore recommend that initial treatment with an external fixator should be preferred and after consolidation of the soft tissue, the definitive stabilization should be done with a stabile osteosynthesis system. Author to editor: This topic remains of a high interest among trauma surgeons, especially now, that angle stable intramedullary fixation systems run the market. Fractures of the clavicle shaft are common and have been typically addressed to nonoperative treatment. But favorable results with the precontured anatomic plates are facilitating surgeons for primary surgical treatment. This study reports the surgical results of 10 adult clavicle shaft fractured patients (age range 18-76) that had been operated with in last 18 months. All fractures were displaced and none of them was open nor had neurovascular injury. Avarege healing time was found 8 weeks (4-50 weeks). All patients had anatomic reduction postoperatively. 5 of the patients fracture site was grafted with DBM. 4 of 10 patients had sterile wound drainage which was lasted for 2 weeks postoperatively (all were grafted with DBM), 5 of them re-operated (3 of them for early implant failure and 2 early implant removal for plate disturbance) and one patient was operated for 5 times (2 of them was in another center) for early implant failure, nonunion,wound problems and neurovascular complications. 9 of 10 was healed eventually. 9 of 10 patients were satisfied with the treatment and had a full range of motion at final follow-up and were able to return to pre-injury occupational and activity levels. Nonoperative treatment of displaced shaft fractures may be associated with a higher rate of nonunion and functional deficits. However, our study shows that surgical treatment also has high complication rates. There is currently considerable debate about the benefits of primary operative treatment of these injuries because it remains difficult to predict which patients will have these complications. Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) is applied in orthopaedic, maxillofacial and plastic surgery with variable outcome. Different growth factors and cytokines are stored in platelets, including Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF), contributing to the potential positive effects of PRP. The aim of our study was to investigate the properties of PDGF administered locally in a rat femoral non-union model. In our experiment a critical sized osteotomy was performed in the rat femur, which was filled with a spacer, inhibiting bone formation for a period of 4 weeks. In a second operation this spacer was removed and the test item was applied into the defect. We compared the PDGF group (d = 250 ng, c = 1 lg/ml of PDGF in fibrin matrix) with the FIBRIN alone and BLANK control groups.

Method: In a year time, five patients with severe hand traumas who admitted to our clinic, treated with perforator based three radial artery and two ulnar artery adipose-fascial forearm flaps. The adipose-fascial island flap was raised on one or two of these perforators without sacrificing a major vessel.The flap was transposed to defect region and covered with STSG.

There was no flap loss except one patient who had partial flap necrosis and it healed secondarily. The donor side was healed uneventfully in all the patients. There was no tendon adhesion. Conclus\u0131on: Perforator based radial or ulnar artery adipose-fascial flap is a safe and reliable method for closing defects on the hand. It has both less donor side deformity and fascial component of the flap provides better tendon gliding and less tendon adhesion. However, it requires more experience to raise adipose-fascial flap. Introduction and object\u0131ves: One of the most common causes of the lower extremity defect in adult is a road traffic accident. The most challenging issues is to close the defect on the 1/3 of lower extremity because local tissue is very limited and mostly damaged due to high energy injury. We investigated the difficulties of how we close the defect on one third of the lower extremity particularly in children, in our unit. Method: In a year time, 7 patients under 6 years old admitted to our unit. All patients had Gustillo IIIB injury and the biggest size of the defect was 20 \u00b7 13 cm. One patient had 2 different lesions on the heel the other was on the anterior aspect of tibia. After radical debridement, the wound closed with ALT free flap with in first week of admission. 2 different defects on a lower extremity were closed with ALT and Vastus lateralis muscle free flap with a single pedicle.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Author to editor: The Topic of our Presentation: Research in Trauma"}, {"text": "Result: The biggest flap size was 22 \u00b7 13 cm.

Conclus\u0131on: In children even less than 6 years age, one of the good and suitable options for closing the defect on the one third of the lower extremity is ALT as a free flap. Stable odontoid fractures can be treated with external immobilization using, e.g., a Philadelphia collar (PC) or a halo thoracic vest (HTV). It is important to delineate the capacity of both orthoses, Halo and Philly, for immobilization of the atlantoaxial complex (AAC), e.g., for their use in odontoid fracture care. In this in-vivo biomechanical comparison 20 volunteers (mean age = 30.9 \u00b1 4.2) were subjected to flexion-extension radiographs immobilized in a modified HTV and a PC. Radiographs were analyzed for the segmental rotation angle of C1-2 in sagittal plane (SRA C1-2) and the absolute rotation angle of C2-7 (ARA C2-7). Separation angles (rSRA C1-2 and rARA C2-7) were calculated from flexion-extension views. Concerning restriction of subaxial sagittal plane motion, the HTV was more effective than the PC. The difference for the rARA C2-7 between the PC (mean 20.7\u00b0) and HTV (mean 9.2\u00b0) yielded significance (p = 0.01). But, concerning restriction of flexion-extension at the AAC, there was no statistical significant difference for the rSRA C1-2 between the PC and HTV (p = 0.3). PC (mean 1.3\u00b0) was superior to the HTV (mean 3.3\u00b0) in restricting sagittal motion at C1-2. In comparison to normals atlantoaxial motion was restricted by 88.5% (PC) and 70.8% (HTV). The current study demonstrated that there was no significant difference in restriction of sagittal motion at C1-2 between the PC and HTV. In light of the current biomechanical data and a selected review of literature it is concluded that the use of a PC is sufficient for the treatment of stable odontoid fractures. Introduct\u0131on: Although most ankle injuries are associated ligamentous structures, some types of fractures mimic to ligamentous sprain and misdiagnosed as well. Most of the ankle sprains undergo radiographic examination and some of type fractures easily are missed even X-ray. The aim of this study is to evaluate the missed talar neck fractures and to emphasize the missed fractures. Mater\u0131als-Methods: Misdiagnosed 8 cases were included in the study. Average age at the time of trauma was 28 (20-40). All cases evaluated prospectively. If the patients had ankle sprain and their initial X-rays show no evident of fracture, they were involved in the study. The diagnosis of the fracture was figured out by control X-ray, CT scan and MRI (except 1 case). All patients were evaluated by the scoring system of American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS Introduct\u0131on and object\u0131ves: Treatment of proximal humeral fractures remains controversial, because of complexity of this kind of fractures. The purpose of this study is to present our first experience using angular stable fixation in 3 and 4 part proximal humeral fractures Method: In last 6 mounts we treated 19 patients with this method, 9 men and 10 women (mean age 62). Anterior approach was performed in every case (MIS technique in two cases), and every patients underwent to early rehabilitation. Periodical clinical and radiographic control were performed. Results: Short term results are good with satisfaction of the patient, no pain and acceptable range of motion. We have 1 case of deep infection that need revision surgery and antibiotic treatment. Preoperative diagnosis of appendiceal diverticulitis is rare. The incidence of appendiceal diverticulitis ranges from 0.004 to 2.1%. 60% of the diverticulitis of colon cases appear above 70 years of age, and they are mostly in the left colon. Case: A 73 year-old male, who had a 1-year history of episodic right lower quadrant abdominal pain was admitted to the surgical emergency department for worsening of his complaints. The physical examination was only notable for right lower quadrant abdominal tenderness. Laboratory findings was normal. On ultrasonography examination signs of acute appendicitis was noted. As the radiological findings did not match with the clinical status of the patient, he was followed up. Later, acute abdominal symptoms appeared, and the patient was admitted to the operating theatre. Two 1 cm long nodules were seen on the appendix preoperatively. Appendectomy was done. The patient was discharged on the first postoperative day. The histopatological examination revealed acute appendicitis signs and two 10 mm long diverticula one of which is inflamed in the middle and the other in the distal part of the specimen were reported. Conclus\u0131on: The most common cause of acute appendicitis in adult population is fecaloid. Lymphoid hyperplasia, carsinoid tumors, mucosel, parasites, fruit and vegetable seeds are other causes.

Method and Technique: We are describing a L-configuration reattachment of distal biceps tendon rupture, using a single anterior transverse incision at the cubital fossa crease. Each pair of sutures from the most distal anchor is passed through the distal part of the tendon. One strand of each pair is passed in a zig zag fashion through the tendon whilst the other strand is simply passed straight through the tendon in a posterior to anterior direction. The four strands of the proximal anchor are passed so that they form two mattress sutures through the proximal part of the tendon. Tightening is then performed in a specific sequence with initially pulling on strand A and B to bring the tendon down to bone and then tightening these to the corresponding suture strand of their pair. The two pairs of sutures are then tied to each other. This second anchor tightening ensures that the tendon is brought down onto the bone in an L configuration increasing the contact surface area between tendon and bone. Results: We have used this technique in 26 patients till now with excellent results and no re-ruptures. Discussion: Our technique is simple to perform and provides a sound repair with a large surface area of contact between tendon and bone. Results: Out of a 66% (n = 494) response rate, 305 respondents (101 male, 204 female) were included in the study. We excluded people with previous hip, knee or back problems. In our study, the symptom scores that is Lysholm, Oxford and Visual analogue scale for pain and function did not show any significant decline with age. On the other hand, the scores measuring activity levels that is Tegner and UCLA scales declined significantly with increasing age. Our normal scores were far ahead of age-matched post operative scores following total knee replacement. There was no difference between males and females. The symptom scores declined with increase in medical problems. Conclus\u0131on: Our age matched scores were superior to post operative total knee replacement (TKR) scores from the NJR. This furthered our motive to create a set of reference knee scores in the normal population which could be used by other studies to compare their results and help improve postoperative outcomes. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent stromal cells that have extensive proliferative potential and the ability to undergo multilineage differentiation. Traditionally, osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells has been studied in cells isolated from bone marrow and iliac crest. However, these harvest techniques are associated with several problems, including donor morbidity, pain, and limited amount of cells. Only a few years ago, adipose tissue has been identified as another source of mulitpotent MSCs, which are referred to as Adipose Derived Stem Cells (ADSCs). The aim of our study was to provide a comparative analysis of primary osteoblasts from the iliac crest and osteogenic differentiated MSCs from adipose tissue, using osteoblast-specific protein expression. In 21 patients the cells were differentiated into the osteoblast lineage using osteogenic medium (ADOBs). Primary osteoblasts were isolated from iliac crest specimens in 30 patients undergoing osteosynthesis with spongioplasty (female: 16, male: 14, mean age 54 \u00b1 14.7). Phenotype marker expression of osteoblast-specific proteins osteocalcin, alkaline phosphase, type I collagen, and CBFA-1 (Runx-2) was analyzed up to 21 days following incubation using RT-PCR, western blot, and immunocytochemistry. Additionaly, the following surface proteins of ADSCs were analyzed: nucleostemin, CD34, CD105, CD 10, CD 13, CD 59, and CD 166. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the non-differentiated ADSCs contained different types of stromal cells with a large variety of CD marker expression. Surface protein expression (CD) did not differ significantly in cells isolated from either fat tissue or bone. Author to editor: Saved by LookUs. Background: At our department, classification of the responsiveness to fluid resuscitation and a simple and practical damage control surgery (DCS) scoring system have been used to determine the efficacy of the treatment strategy in trauma patients. Cases and Methods: We examined 247 out of 289 hepatic injury patients, excluding cardiopulmonary arrest cases. The present study was undertaken to establish a valid strategy for the treatment of hepatic injury, and further improvement of the survival rate was evaluated based on the grater and equal of grade IV [Organ Injury Scale (OIS)] hepatic injury necessitating emergency room laparotomy. Result: Interventional Radiology (IVR) treatment cases were all stable or responder patients and all survived with effective hemostasis. Transient responder or non responder patients that needed hemostasis were treated by emergency laparotomy, and all the cases that eventually expired needed DCS. The mean injury severity score (ISS) was 42.3 and the mean probability of survival (Ps) was 0.413, and hemostasis treatment was started within a mean of 39.1 min, yielding a survival rate of 42.9% in the cases with grater and equal grade IV (OIS) liver injury that needed emergency room laparotomy. Conclusion: Our criteria for deciding the therapeutic strategy based on the response to the initial fluid resuscitation seemed to be useful from the viewpoint of hemostasis for liver injury. The key to securing quality regional trauma care is to designate a trauma care hospital as a trauma center and to transport severely injured patients to the center as rapidly as possible.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 73, "end": 76, "text": "1 1", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "L-configuration Re-attachment of Distal Biceps Tendon Rupture"}, {"text": "Author to editor: We show that our classification of the responsiveness to fluid resuscitation and a simple and practical damage control surgery (DCS) scoring system is very effective for liver injury strategy.

The imaging is essential for a prompt diagnosis. Purpose: To prospectively study the mechanism, distribution of injury, and outcome of patients hospitalized with camel bite injury. Methodology: All patients admitted to Al-Ain Hospital with a camel bite were prospectively studied over 6 years (October 2001 -October 2007 . Mechanism of injury including behavior of the camel, distribution and severity of injury, patient's demography, and outcome were studied. Results: All 33 patients were males having a median (range) age of 27 (10-58). Almost half of them were Pakistani. Twenty-five were camel caregivers while five were camel riders. Seven patients were raised up by the camel's mouth and thrown to the ground while the other patients were only bitten. Majority of the injuries were in the upper limb (21) followed by the head and neck (8). 10/21 upper limb injuries had associated fractures. Two patients who were bitten at the neck were admitted to the ICU. One of them died due to massive left-brain infarction and the other had complete quadriplegia due to spinal cord injury. The median hospital stay was 6 days. One patient died (3%). Conclus\u0131on: The behavior of the camel is occasionally unpredictable and the canine teeth of the camel, which are long, can cause severe penetrating trauma despite the small puncture on the skin. Care should be taken when handling the camel. Author to editor: Dear colleague: This is the only prospective clinical study of camel bites in the literature that took us 6 years to collect. The data is very unique and is of great interest. Fikri Abu-Zidan Gastrointestinal cytomegalavirus infections occurs predominantly in immunocompromised patients.Involvement of the gastrointestinal tract in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients is frequent. However the prevalence of cytomegalovirus appendicitis is exceedingly rare. Case: A 44 year-old male infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, who had chronic abdominal pain with subsequent development of acute right lower quadrant tenderness was admitted to the surgical emergency department. His physical examination revealed no other finding than a mass in the right lower quadrant. His abdominal ultrasonography and abdominal CT revealed a plastron appendicitis. So he was hospitalized for medical treatment and discharged after 10 days of treatment. His control abdominal ultrasonography and CT at the second month showed that plastron appendicitis persisted, therefore the patient was rehospitalized. He was discharged after 10 days of medical treatment. After 3 months the patient experienced severe abdominal pain. Appendectomy was performed and histopathogic examination revealed a cytomegalovirus infection. The problems related to diagnose cytomegalovirus appendicitis and therapeutic management of cytomegalovirus infections are discussed. Conclusion: Aggressive use of ultrasound and abdominal computed tomographic scanning, along with early surgical intervention, is recommended. Introduction: Spontaneous intramural hematoma of intestine due to anticoagulan therapy is an unusual reason for acute abdomen. The first symptom is usually severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. The most useful radiographic methods is computed tomography. The treatment approach is conservative and surgical. We present four patients treated our clinics due to intramural hematom. Two patients are treated surgically and two patients are treated conservatively. Material and method: We carried out four patients diagnosed and treated for intramural hematoma of small intestine between 2003 and 2008 years in Haydarpasa Numune Training and Research Hospital second surgery department. We examine in this patients age, sex, etiologcy, hematologic parameters, the treatment approach (conservative and surgery), hospitalization times. Results: The mean age of the patients was 60.2 years (range 38-78). All patients were male. The etiological factor was warfarin treatment due to aort valve replacement in three patient and ischemic cerebral disease in one patient. Laboratuary parameters were elevated leukocyte counts in all patients. Two patients was treated by surgical treatment due to intestinal obstriction and ishemia Two patient was treated conservatively (nasogastric decompression and total parenteral nutrition). Median hospitalization time was 8.7 day (8-11). Discussion: When patients using anticoagulan therapy applied to emergency unit with abdominal pain, Physicians must remember intramural hematoma as reason of acute abdomen. First choice is conservative treatment however cases of acute abdomen with intestinal obstriction and ischemia require surgical intervention. Introduct\u0131on: Motorcycle accidents continue to be a source of severe injury. The joy and exhilaration of riding motorcycles brings with it the risk of morbidity and mortality associated with these accidents. Case: It concerns a 47-year-old man that in 21/10/07 entered the emergency room after suffering a motorcycle accident. At the admission he had pain, swelling and deformity of the left knee. Radiographs showed tibial plateau fracture type VI of Schatzker. He was submitted to surgical treatment with open reduction and ostheosynthesis with LISS plate and was orientated to rehabilitation. Six months after, the fracture was healed in correct alignment, had normal gait, normal knee range of motion and returned to work. Eight months after surgery he suffered another motorcycle accident with left leg trauma, radiographs showed a supracondylar femoral fracture type 33.A3 AO-ASIF and diaphyseal tibial fracture below the plate. He underwent surgical treatment with open reduction and osteosynthesis of the supracondilyan femoral fracture with LCP plate, extraction of the LISS plate and ostheosynthesis with diaphyseal LCP plate. Eleven weeks postoperatively, he was able to walk without crutches. Five months after had normal range of motion of the left limb and was working. Conclus\u0131on: Tibial plateau fractures are serious injuries and stable fixation without compromising the soft-tissue envelope is often difficult but with the LISS plate we can achieve fixation of an associated metaphyseal/diaphyseal fracture component with minimal approach. Multiple consecutive fractures are an important source of limb deformity and impairment, which we could prevent in this case. Introduction: The optimum management of non-united humeral diaphyseal fractures remains unclear. A number of implants are available utilising varying operative philosophies and balancing operative complication risks. We present two cases of humeral shaft non-union treated with an intramedullary compression nail, a technique which is previously unreported. Cases: Case 1: A 23 year old male with a closed fracture of the humeral diaphysis (12-A3). Initial failed open reduction and internal fixation with an anterior placed 4.5 mm dynamic compression plate (DCP) was subsequently revised to a posterior 4.5 mm DCP plus bone graft 3 months later. One year post revision, the fracture had failed to unite and was referred to the senior author. He underwent a 2 stage reconstruction with the T2 Humeral Intramedullary nail in compression mode. At 6 month review the fracture had united and at 2 years postoperatively he had full range, pain free shoulder and elbow movement. Case 2: A 90 year old female with a closed diaphyseal humerus fracture (12-A1) treated conservatively in a U slab and functional brace developed a mobile, painful non-union. She underwent the same procedure as above and at 6 months the fracture had united. She was pain free and had full range of elbow movement. Shoulder movement was restricted due to co-existing glenohumeral osteoarthritis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 419, "end": 432, "text": "(October 2001", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 433, "end": 446, "text": "-October 2007", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Ovarian Vein Suppurative Thrombophlebitis Complicating Cesarian Section"}, {"text": "Conclusion: Key tenets of fracture and non-union surgery include the ability to obtain stability and compression. This paper describes the first reported use of an intramedullary nail in compression mode for humeral diaphyseal non-union. Fingertip amputations are the most common type of amputation injury in the upper extremity and they are important because of an often disproportionately long period of convalescence. Different surgical procedures are available for reconstruction, but none is absolutely satisfactory. Twenty-two cases (19 patients) of fingertip amputation have been treated by primary skin closure using the V-Y plasty (Tranquilli-Leali). There were 14 men and 5 women. The average age was 38.7 years. The procedure was carried out under regional anaesthesia using a tourniquet. All devitalized tissue was excised and the bone was smoothed. A triangular flap with a distal base was developed. The width of the base should be the same as the amputated edge of the nail or the nailbed, and the length should be a little longer than the width. The flap was mobilized and sutured to the nail or the nailbed. Finally the volar gap was closed. The average follow-up period was 18 months, ranging from 6 to 27 months. All of the flaps survived and achieved normal or adequate two-point discrimination. Two patients had some loss of distal interphalangeal joint extension and five patients had cold hypersensitivity. Rapid return to work was possible in most cases. The technique is simple and presents an excellent method for fingertip reconstruction in Allen type I, II and III injuries. Bilateral anterior shoulder dislocation is rare, and his aetiology is via various traumatic insults, atraumatic occurrences, and through extreme muscular contractions like epilepsy. In epileptic seizures is more common to occur posterior bilateral dislocation. The aim of this work is to describe a rare case of anterior bilateral shoulder dislocation after a convulsive crisis. It concerns a case of a 35-year-old male, with alcoholism history, who entered the emergency room in 25/05/08 with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. After, he had bilateral shoulder deformity and swelling. Radiographs demonstrated a bilateral anterior shoulder luxation and bilateral greater tuberosity fracture. The dislocation was reduced and both shoulders were immobilized. 1 month later, radiographs showed bilateral reduction maintenance and bilateral greater tuberosity fracture deviation. The patient had extremely restriction of active and passive ranges of motion in both shoulders: in the left had 5\u00ba of active external rotation and 60\u00ba of abduction; in the right 0\u00ba of active external rotation and 50\u00ba of abduction. At this moment surgical procedure was done with bilateral open reduction and osteosynthesis with ''phylus'' plate and was orientated to physical rehabilitation. At the 2 month follow up, he had significantly improved both shoulders range of motion, and returned to the normal daily activities and 2 months later returned to work. Displaced fractures of the greater tuber-osities after shoulder dislocation may result in motion limitation and functional disability. Open reduction and stable fixation allows for early passive motion of the joint and early return to activities of daily living.

Our objective was to assess its severity, prognosis and associated injuries as compared to victims with chest wall trauma following explosions. Material and methods: Retrospective study of victims of the March 11 terrorist bombings in Madrid who were treated at the closest hospital. We compared the group with pure BLI (bilateral infiltrates in a butterfly pattern, and absence of chest wall fractures) (Group I) with that of patients with peripheral infiltrates and chest wall fractures (Group II). Results: Of 58 patients included in the Registry, 45 (78%) had thoracic injuries. 17 (40%) were included in group I, and 27 (60%) in group II. The mean ISS in groups I and II was of 25.8 \u00b1 7 and 20.6 \u00b1 9.5, respectively. Among the critical patient population in both groups (n = 27), those belonging to group II were in need of a longer period of ventilatory support and had more ventilator-associated pneumonias. In group I, the most frequent associated injuries were tympanic perforation (94.4%), 2\u00ba-3\u00ba burns (83.3%) and abdominal trauma (33%).

Mater\u0131als-Method: Twenty three patients with penetrating thoracal stab injury, between 2004 and 2008, were investigated retrospectively.

One of these cases went into emergency coronary artery bypass surgery due to LAD injury. Only four patients required intensive care postoperatively and four patients were lost perioperatively all of which had additional cardiac injury. Conclus\u0131on: The overall mortality rate was 18%, but mortality of patients with additional cardiac stab injury was higher, with a rate of 40%. Suspect of cardiac injury should be considered in patients who are injured close around cardiac area and one should intervene quickly both in diagnosis and treatment. Introduction: Abdomen and thorax blunt and penetrating injuries, common cases of emergency surgery, cause less complication with proper analysis and surgical intervention. Material and method: We retrospectively evaluated 31 patients operated due to thoraco-abdominal blunt and penetrating trauma in _ Istanbul Training and Research Hospital last year. Results: Median age was 33.1 (9-78) and all were male.

Case: A 42-year-old man fallen down onto his left elbow with small skin erosion and a large area with ecchymosis on the elbow presented. Left radial and ulnar pulses were nonpalpable but no sign of acute ischemia was noticed. He had drop hand and could minimally make flexion, opposition, abduction and adduction of fingers. Strength of fingers, wrist flexion and thumb adduction were weak. Radiography was normal. Emergent surgical exploration was performed with prediagnosis of severe closed soft tissue injury and vascular damage. Brachial artery and vein had complete disruption with rupture of brachial muscle and the anterior joint capsule. Elbow joint could be posteriorly dislocated. Artery and vein were repaired with saphenous vein graft. Median and ulnar nerves had normal appearance. At postoperative 12th hour nerve injuries showed complete recovery. He could have normal range of motion in the wrist and hand. Sensorial examination was normal. He had a well perfused arm. Conclus\u0131on: Spontaneously reduced dislocations of the elbow can be sometimes missed. Large hematoma and neurologic dysfunction in closed injury of the elbow indicate severe trauma of joint also in case of normal bone structure in radiography. Immediate diagnosis and operative treatment of brachial artery injury is mandatory. Closed elbow dislocation and multiple nerve injuries may have good results with conservative treatment. We present the case of a 53 y male, with his left lower limb severely damaged by a caterpillar vehicle. He was admitted in the ER about 90 min after the accident. He presented with exposed fractures of the femur and leg bones, extensive soft tissue and muscle damage, class III shock, and an umbilical clamp in the exteriorized femoral artery in the thigh, placed by a fireman in site. The MESS (Mangled Extremity Severity Score) calculated for this patient was 9. After the initial assessment in the ER the patient was transfered to the OR. He had a complete transection of the femoral artery and vein with a severe ischemic foot. Despite the MESS score, a vascular and bone repairs have been considered. Two temporary shunts were placed in both femoral vessels (artery and vein) followed by external fixation of the femur and leg fractures. The definitive vascular repair of the artery and vein was made with autologous saphenous vein after the bone fixation.

Besides this, it has the ability to cause continuing tissue destruction, from 6th hour to 28th day after injury. This fact could explain why there was no artery lesion at the admission but at the 20th day. Conclus\u0131on: Sulphuric acid burn is potential devastating and tend to be prolonged in time, obliging to a continuous monitoring and multidisciplinary approach. Introduction and object\u0131ves: The medicolegal studies show that the most frequent mechanisms of the lethal major vascular injuries were stab wounds followed by gunshot wounds and blunt trauma.

Ecchymotic bruises on the left abdominal-pelvic, femoral, right inguinal, genital region, deformation under the right knee were observed during the autopsy. It was determined that there was a traumatic transection on the left common femoral artery and vein, which was accompanied by massive bleeding in surrounding soft tissues and muscles without any fracture of the left femur.

If vascular injury was determined in the early times after the trauma, surgical and medical treatment could be performed successfully and the case could survive. Introduct\u0131on: Traumatic Internal Carotid Artery dissection is a rare and grave cause of embolic strokes occurred especially in young age group. If it is not diagnosed early and required treatment is not given, thrombosis can be a serious trouble with permanent neurological deficit and high mortality rate up to 40%. Case: We presented a delayed diagnosed traumatic carotid artery dissection in a 21 year-old female case. There were no ischemic infarct findings in the cerebral CT on admission, but there were cerebral infarct findings in the cerebral CT taken twice because of the left hemiplegia noticed 7 days later when the patient regained her consciousness. We made the diagnosis of the case, forwarded to our emergency service with acute cerebral infarct diagnosis, certain through arterial Doppler ultrasonography, cerebral MRI, diffusion MRI and MR angiography. We did not consider invasive treatment since the neurological damage was permanent and dissection grade was IV according to angiography findings. We did not administrate anticoagulant treatment considering that the patient can turn her ischemic infarct into hemorrhagic infarct. The case was discharged within a week and advised physiotherapy. Conclus\u0131on: Although the advances in diagnostic methods, diagnosis with traumatic carotid artery dissection is still missed out or delayed as in the case we presented. Early diagnosis enables permanent neurological damage to be decreased or vanished. However, the vital factors for early diagnosis are the obtained anamnesis to direct to radiological examinations, detailed physical examination and high clinical doubts. Introduction: Acute arterial occlusion is a serious clinical condition resulting death of patient or related organs. These are usually older patients with a lot of comorbid conditions. Method: _ In our clinic, We retrospectively examined the records of 73 patients who underwent surgical treatment for acute arterial occlusion between January 2005 and December 2008. Mean age of patients was 66.8 years. 35 (48%) of these patients were female, and 38 (52%) were male. Embolic occlusions were found in an upper extremity in 13 (18%) patients and in a lower extremity in 60 (82%). The most common source of these emboli was cardiac origin. Atherosclerosis, trauma and arterial catheters were the other causes of emboli. 35 (48%) of patients were admitted less than 6 h preoperatively, 18 (25%) were admitted 6-24 h preoperatively, 20 (27%) were admitted after a delay of longer than 24 h preoperatively. 27 (37%) of patients were in sinus rythm, 46 (63%) were in atrial fibrillation preoperatively. Motor dysfunction of extremity was found in 24 (33%) of patients preoperatively. Diagnosis was based on the findings of physical examinations and emergent doppler ultrasonography. Any other invasive evaluation was not performed to decrease acute occlusive ischemic period. Surgical intervention had performed immediately Results: The overall mortal\u0131ty rate was 12% (9). _ In 10 (13.6%) of patients, after setting of demarcation line, amputation was performed. Conclus\u0131on: Early diagnosis, catheter embolectomy and use of anticoagulation are very important therapeutic modalities for limb salvage and reduction of morbidity and mortality. There was a comorbidity in all patients and cardiac disease and hypertension were the most common ones. The most common laboratory abnormalities were leukocytosis, hypoalbuminemia, hyperamylasemia. There was superiory vasculary necrosis in 16 patients, inferior vasculary necrosis in one patient.One patient had nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia. Segmentery resection was performed to 13 patients. Abdominoperineal resection was performed to the patient with inferior mesenter artery occlusion. We performed duodenotransversostomy on two patients and only laparotomy on two patients. Reoperation was required in five patients. Causes of death was multiorgan insufficiency in seven cases, cardiac death in two cases.One patient died due to short intestine syndrome. Results: The patient was discharged on postoperative 16th hours without any complications.

All the imaging findings of different complications were evaluated and differential diagnosis with postoperative modifications in the posttraumatic period was performed. Results: In order to facilitate the specification, the intraabdominal postoperative complications were classified as follows: superficial infections: infections of the abdominal wall (cellulites, abscess, phlegmona); visceral infections (abscess, cholangitis, fistulas); intra-and retroperitoneal infections (peritonitis, abscess, hematomas, bilomas, urinomas). The most frequent postoperative complications and the common postoperative status in polytrauma patients were described, being illustrated with examples from our experience. Conclusions: Postoperative infections represent significant causes of morbidity and the diagnosis is difficult.

Results: The patient's age range was 41-70 years (mean 56.5 years), three female and 3 male. Clinical findings include chronic and acute, life threatening GI bleeding and abdominal pain. Gastric corpus was involved in two, antrum in three and antero-corporal part in one case. Posterior wall was involved in all six cases. Ulcerations were present in all cases. Endogastric growth was observed in one, exogastric four and mixed in one case. Indications for surgery were one emergency for life threatening bleeding; three cases with acute bleeding, after treatment with blood products, planed treatment and two elective surgeries for gastric tumors. Wedge resection has been performed in two, gastrectomy in four cases, without fatality. Follow-up ranges between 1 and 38 months after surgery, without bleeding, recurrence or metastasis. CD117 and CD34 were positive. Conclusions: Even rare, GI bleeding causes by gastric GIST might be life threatening. Urgent and complete surgical resection with achieving negative margins is the standard therapy of bleeding gastric GIST. Author to editor: I think that Scientific Committee is doing very good job. All the nine patients had a damage control surgery and six survived. Mortality was associated with the delayed diagnosis, the extension of necrotized bowel and severity of peritonitis at the time of the first laparotomy. Conclusions: Evidence from the series of patients described suggests that damage control surgery improves survival in patients suffering acute mesenteric ischaemia. A damage control approach involves emergency resection of ischaemic bowel with no attempt to restore gastrointestinal continuity and formation of a laparotomy. Patients are stabilized in the intensive care unit (ICU) and definitive surgery is then considered after 2, 3 or more days.

In 2006 the German Trauma Society introduced the TASH-Score, which estimates the probability of MT following a multiple trauma. Our aims are to determine MT incidence and outcomes in our environment, and to analyze the value of the TASHscore in our series.Conclusions: MT is associated to a high mortality, 48.1% in our study. TASH-score had a good predictive value in our series but over-estimated the relationship between unstable pelvic fracture and MT. were the most frequent etiologies. Mean age was 39 years. 100% of the patients in the labor related trauma were men, and 63% in the intencional fall. Mean ISS score was 27.3 and NISS was 34.1. Trauma severity according to ISS and NISS scores was higher in the high falls group than in other etiologies of severe trauma. Spine and tibia were the most frequent damaged bones. The most frequent injury combination was pelvis and long bone. Mortality was 14.3%. Mortality rates among the suicidal attempts and labor related group were 21.3 and 17%, respectively. Exanguination and BTI were the most frequent causes of mortality among the intentional and accidental groups respectively. Discussion: Vertical deceleration injuries after high fall are a frequent cause of severe blunt trauma. Patients in the intentional group present different injury patterns, have higher severity scores and higher mortality. The etiology of the mortality varies between the jumpers and fallers group. Keywords: high falls, suicidal attempt, pattern of injury.Background: Trauma remains a major cause of death and disability in our world. Many scoring systems have been proposed to predict mortality and survival. This study was performed to evaluate the influence of routine thoracoabdominal CT on the predicted survival analysis according to the TRISS method. Based on the injuries detected by CT scan on indication, mean ISS was 14.6, resulting in a predicted survival of 87.45% using the TRISS methodology. Routine thoracoabdominal CT scan resulted in a mean ISS of 16.9, resulting in a predicted survival of 86.27%. Victims of terrorist bombings show a greater deterioration of their emotional and psychological universe than casualties of more conventional trauma and are more prone to depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress syndrome, but with less social interaction alterations. Author to editor: Trauma outcome is still mainly measured by riskadjusted mortality and preventable deaths, but there are few data on functional outcome and quality of life. On other hand, victims of terrorist explosions represent a unique group of trauma patients where those data might be different from the more conventional trauma group128 Primary Management of the Posterior Urethra by Traction Over the Foley Catheter in Patients with Pelvic FracturesBackground: Pelvic fractures with injury to the posterior urethra are quite rare. There is no uniform policy regarding treatment. Operative realignment of the disrupted urethra over the Foley catheter is an old method giving the best results with regard to the serious squeals of the injury, such as incontinence, impotence and stricture of the urethra. However, it is usually performed after initial operative procedure of stabilization of fractured pelvis. Patients and methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 17 polytraumatized patients with type C pelvic fractures and complete disruption of the posterior urethra treated by traction over the Foley catheter in one single surgical procedure in teamwork of traumatologist and urologist. Results: Nine patients did not have any complications 1 year after the procedure. In eight cases we found short partial stenoses of the posterior urethra, which were successfully resolved by intraureteral dilatation with bougienage intrauretral resection or in one case by transperitoneal resection. There was no impotence and no incontinence found.Conclusions: The method used was successful and offered good results with few complications and avoiding additional interventions. Adhesion-molecule dependent processes occur in post-capillary venules whereas adhesion-molecule independent retention occurs in micro-capillaries. The latter requires process F-actin polymerization of the neutrophil cytoskeleton. We show that sFg can reduce both types of neutrophil-EC interactions. Methods: Neutrophil adhesion to EC was studied in an in vitro flowchamber. Cells, pre-incubated with various concentrations sFg or albumin, were perfused over TNF activated or chemokine presenting Neutrophils incubated with sFg appeared round, a feature of unactivated cells. sFg decreased the length of chemo-attractantinduced actin polymerization. sFg did not activate neutrophils, measured by intracellular [Ca2+], p-Erk or Nfjb phosphorylation. Conclusion: Acute phase concentrations of sFg reduce neutrophil adherence and sequestration. Achievement of high plasma concentration of sFg directly after shock has the potential to reduce neutrophil adherence. Resuscitation using sFg or Fg-derived peptides might prevent ARDS and MOF.Objective: Crush injury or traumatic rhabdomyolysis is caused by crushing of large muscle mass, usually of the femoral and gluteal compartment. Crush syndrome is general manifestation of crush injury with acute renal failure (ARF). ARF is caused by deposition of myoglobin in distal tubules. The concentration of serum creatin phosphokinase and myoglobin is an indicator of the extent of injured muscle. We investigated the association between Injury Severity Score (ISS) and BUN, Myoglobin and CPK. The results were compared with internationally available logistic regression models for survival (adjusted for age, injury grade, physiology and mechanism of injury), using W-statistics. The TRISSmodel with coefficients from the National Trauma Data Bank (2005) (W_NTDB 05) and the UK TARN (W_TARN) were chosen. Results: Crude mortality rate for severely and critically injured decreased from 21 to 14% and 33 to 21%, respectively. W-statistics indicate increased survival for the period after strengthening the institutional trauma care organization with a formal Trauma Unit. The improvement increases with increasing severity of injury, reaching significance for the critically injured. Conclusion: Organizing trauma care in a formal Trauma Unit was followed by improved survival of the severely and critically injured patients.Mohamed Akhavanheidari, Peter Rhee, Rifat Latifi 1 1 Department of Surgery, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA Conclusion: Very few trauma centers have psychiatric units and patients are transferred for inpatient treatment and lost for follow up. Considering the facts that 33% are new patients, 12% repeat offenders, and 10% of trauma mortality is due to suicide, there is a need for a suicide prevention and intervention protocol within the trauma system.

Most of the papers presented focus mainly on the safety of the technique and on the implant/radial nerve relationships. Less information is given about the indications and the results in relation to the type of fracture and patients and about the the pitfalls of this demanding technique. Materials and methods: Between 2006 and 2008 we operated on 18 patients with humeral shaft fractures with MIPO. We mainly used 4.5 LCPs placed laterally on the humeral shaft through two incisions and after isolation of the radial and circumflex nerves. In some cases a third incision was made to reduce the fracture and insert a lag screw or to facilitate plate positioning. We retrospectively reviewed all the patients and registered the surgical time, complications, time to union and clinical results with the DASH and Constant scores. Conclusion: We conclude that MIPO of humeral shaft fractures is a demanding technique that requires a deep understanding of the fracture fixation principles and a good acquaintance with mipo techniques to achieve good results. We recommend a namely Mipo technique for multifragmentary fractures but when dealing with a simple fracture we suggest to obtain a good fracture reduction, even through a minimal access to the fracture if needed. We do not recommend this procedure in obese patients and in not collaborative patients, but we believe that in selected cases the results can be good and easily predictable. Quality of Life and Functional Results after Open Reduction and Internal Fixation of Calcaneal Fractures Pieter Boele Van Hensbroek 1 , Nicole A.m. Heesakkers 1 , Jan S.K. Luitse 1 , Mario Maas 2 , J. Carel Goslings 1 1 Trauma Unit, Department of Surgery, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands 2 Department of Radiology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The NetherlandsBackground: Dislocated fractures are often treated by means of Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF). However, little evidence exists about the long-term results of this treatment. Purpose: To assess the quality of life and functional result after ORIF of the calcaneus. Methods: All consecutive patients with a dislocated calcaneal fracture, who underwent an ORIF in our hospital during an 8-year period, were selected. Fractures were classified according to Essex-Lopresti. The quality of life and functional result were assessed using the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) and the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS). Results: One hundred and ten patients, of which 73 men (66.4%) were selected. The median age was 41.3 years. Sixty-seven patients (60.9%) sustained an isolated fracture, and in 98 patients (89.1%) the fracture was unilateral. Forty-nine patients (44.5%) sustained an Essex-Lopresi 'Joint depression' fracture. Nine patients (8.2%) underwent an arthrodesis of the posterior talo-calcaneal (PTC) joint. The median EQ-5D score was 0.69 (general Dutch population = 0.88). The median FAOS sub-scores (100 = best) ranged between 50 and 83.8. There was no difference in EQ-5D or FAOS scores between 'Joint depression' and 'Tongue type' fractures. Patients with multitrauma or a PTC arthrodesis had significantly worse EQ-5D, FAOS Pain, -Daily living, and -Quality of life scores as compared with the other patients. Conclusion: Quality of life in patients with ORIF of dislocated fractures is lower than the general Dutch population. Multitrauma and a PTC arthrodesis are associated with a worse quality of life and functional result.Purpose of study: Authors present their experiences with deep frozen meniscus transplantation in young patients with weight bearing pain and chondromalacy in injured compartment after menisectomy. Methods: Chondromalacy and pain begins usually in some years after subtotal menisectomy in injured compartment. Meniscus transplantation could improve forces transmission and could help to cartilage healing. Material: From May 2004 to June 2007 operated authors 34 meniscus transplantation, with arthrotomy in 23 patients, arthroscopically in 11 patients, 15 women and 19 men, 24 medial and 10 lateral. Contemporary ACL reconstruction was in 11 patients. All menisci were fixed transosseous to the tibia in anterior and posterior horn and with PDS suture to the capsule. In 8 biologically young patients (31-39 years) with cartilage defects 2nd-3rd second. Outerbridge and good X-ray axis made contemporary microfracture of cartilage defects. Results: All patients were healed without complications. All patients had no walking pain in 4 months after operation. Control arthroscopy was made in 11 patients from which 6 were after microfracture. All menisci were healed and defects were covered with good fibrocartilage tissue. Control MRI was in 13 patient and all menisci showed normal density. Discussion: Meniscus transplantation is a new method by which is possible to improve conditions in weight bearing compartment after menisectomy. Deep frozen meniscus grafts healed without problems to the capsule and tibia, decrease weight bearing transmission and improve lubrication of the synovial fluid and by the way nutrition of cartilage too. Results are short time but look very promising.227 U-shaped Sacral Fractures: Surgical Treatment and Quality of Life Astrid J.

We investigated BF by Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella oxytoca on polyethylene, titanium and stainless steel and we tested whether maggot excretions/ secretions (ES) interfered with BF. Comb-models of the biomaterials were made to fit into 96-well microtiter plates. Aliquots of 100 ll of suspensions of 2.5 x 10E5 bacteria/ml and nutrient medium were added to each well. Combs were placed in the wells and incubated for 3, 5, 7, and 9 days at 37\u00b0C. Biofilms were stained with crystal-violet, eluted in ethanol and quantified by measuring the optical density at 595 nm. Maggots excretions/secretions (ES) were collected according to a standardized method, added in different concentrations to (nonstained) mature biofilms (7 days), incubated another 24 h, stained and measured. The results showed tight BF by S. aureus and S. epidermidis, which was strongest on polyethylene and weakest on stainless steel (p = 0.0001). BF by K. oxytoca, E. faecalis, and E. cloacae was very weak on all biomaterials. The effects of ES were tested on S. aureus and S. epidermidis only, because of the weak BF of the other bacterial species. On all materials, BF by S. aureus was inhibited (p \u00a3 0.0063) and even broken down by ES (p \u00a3 0.0407). S. epidermidis showed comparable results. Previously, we showed reduction of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. We conclude that maggot ES can reduce BF and may be used as adjuvant therapy to reduce BF on orthopaedic materials.

There was a time when open reduction by large incisions were performed in these patients. Today, under the impression of the MIPO technique indirect, closed reduction and plate insertion without any big incisions are proposed. The disadvantage of this technique, which acts perfectly well in compound fractures, are malrotations, that may ask for further surgery. These types of fractures can also be treated by open reduction using a small incision and insertion of the plate by means of another two small incisions. Interfragmentary compression can be achieved by a lagscrew through a plate hole. The advantage of this technique is anatomic reduction (without any rotational deformity) and rigid fixation in combination with ''MIPO'' insertion of a plate. This technique can be used in distal tibia fractures (most common location), humerus shaft fractures (if no nail is at hand) and radius shaft fractures.

In 45% closed fracture reduction was successful, in 55% a 2-3 cm incision above the fracture was necessary. Intraoperative complications were: unsuccessful reduction and conversion to ORIF in two cases, bleeding in one case. Infection occured in three cases. In 5.4% TEN had to be removed after fracture union because of medial migration protruding under the skin. Mean hospital stay was 2.5 days. Shoulder exercises began on day 1.

We hypothesized that the expandable nails have satisfied results as well as conventional locking intramedullary nails in treatment of selected fractures. The study included 68 patients had femoral midshaft fractures. The mean age was 32.6 (18-70). Forty-eight fractures were treated by interlocking intramedullary nailing and 20 fractures by inflatable intramedullary nailing. The patients were evaluated with regard to operation times, range of motion in postoperative period, fracture union times, weight bearing times, and fluoroscopy application times. The mean follow-up of 26.9 weeks. The results were evaluated according to the Thoresen criteria. Final evaluation included 62 fractures whose follow-ups were completed (missed cases from conventional nail group). The mean time to union was interlocking for intramedullary nailing was 16.5 weeks and for inflatable intramedullary nailing was 15.2 weeks (12-24). average operation time was interlocking intramedullary nailing 93 min (55-120) and expandable intramedullary nailing 26.3 min (20-35). According to the Thoresen criteria, interlocking intramedullary nailing 86.6% and expandable intramedullary nailing 95% of patients had excellent or good results. Exposure to ionizing radiation was minimized by expandable intramedullary nailing. Most difficult part of the intramedullary nailing is distal interlocking period. This period is time consuming and includes more radiation from fluroscopy. The expandable nails can straighten out that period. They present enough stability without locking nails in selected cases. The inflatable nails have a reliable alternative for treatment of selected femur fractures.

Its advantages are short application time, low blood loss, and minimal surgical dissection. We retrospectively evaluated the clinical and radiological results of proximal femoral nails applied in our institute. Methods: In this study 73 hips of 71 patients were included. There were 34 male and 37 female patients. The average age was 71.2 (33-95 years). Only 29 patients accepted to come for radiological control and for remaining 42 patients Barthel Daily Living Activity Score (BDLAS) and mortality rate were evaluated by telephone interview. Physical examination, fracture healing, BDLAS, and complications were evaluated. Results: Fifteen (21.1%) patients were dead. Radiographic healing of fracture was observed in 27 of 29 patients. No callus formation was observed in radiographs of two patients. In four patients cephalomedullar screw penetration was observed. The mean BDLSA was 18/ 20 (8-20). No infection was detected. Mean surgical duration was 42.4 min, and mean blood loss was 108 cc. Patients did not require blood transfusion. Conclusion: Proximal femoral nailing technique has several advantages for intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric femoral fractures in elderly patients with minimal surgical dissection, minimal blood loss, and short operation time. These factors decrease mortality and morbidity. However, instable fractures require surgical experience for this technique. Maggot Excretions and Antibiotics in Infected Wounds: do They Have a Synergistic Effect? Department of Trauma surgery, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands 2 Department of Medical Microbiology and Infection Control, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The NetherlandsMaggots are successfully used as a treatment for severe infected wounds in trauma patients. We investigated whether maggot excretions/secretions (ES) influence the antibacterial activity of different antibiotics. We determined minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of gentamicin and flucloxacillin for Staphylococcus aureus, of penicillin for Streptococcus pyogenes, of amoxicillin and vancomycin for Enterococcus faecalis, of gentamicin for Enterobacter cloacae, and of gentamicin, tobramycin and ciprofloxacin for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bacteria were grown overnight in nutrient medium. In the first experiment, we determined MIC and MBC of every bacterium and antibiotic alone. Then, by checkerboard titration, we investigated a range of concentrations of antibiotics in combination with ES and compared MIC and MBC. A start inoculum of 5 \u00b7 10E6 bacteria/ mL was used. The results show a dose-dependent synergistic antibacterial effect of gentamicin and ES on S. aureus (p = 0.0015). In presence of ES, MIC and MBC of gentamicin decrease 32-fold. Gentamicin and ES reduce the bacterial growth of P. aeruginosa (p = 0.0001). The other ES/antibiotic combinations showed no synergistic or antagonistic effect. As we showed in previous research, ES alone have no antibacterial effect. The synergistic effect of gentamicin and ES can be of direct importance in clinical practice, because a very low concentration of gentamicin is bactericidal in presence of ES and thus the risk of gentamicin side-effects (nefrotoxicity and hearing loss) can be minimized. In further research, we will focus on the mechanism behind this synergism and on possible indirect antibacterial activity of maggots and/or their ES.

The aim of this study is to report experience on pelvic ring injuries. Materials-method: Between 2003 and 2008 396 pelvic ring fractures were evaluated at our trauma department. Fractures were classified according to Tile classification. There were 283 Type A, 75 Type B, and 38 Type C fractures. Immediate pelvic external fixator was applied in 11 hemodynamic unstable pelvic ring injuries to restore hemodynamic stability. In the 8 of these 11 patients, urogenital injuries were also operated in the same sessions. Seven pelvic belts were used to maintain hemodynamic stability. 15 open book injuries were followed closely without intervention. 14 sacroiliac joint dislocation were stabilized with percutaneous cannulated screws. Four symphysis pubis diastasis were treated with plate-screw fixation. Results: Two patients who had additional severe injuries died despite intensive care management. One patient with open pelvic fracture had deep wound infection and treated after recurrent debridments and antibiotic therapy. Pelvic fixators were removed at an average of 8. At the latest radiologic evaluation 13 patients were seen to have a slight pelvic tilt, there were four pseudoarthrosis. Five patients had significant sensory loss. Conclusions: Early management of pelvic fractures with multidisciplinary approach may decrease the mortality and morbidity. Damage control orthopaedics is the current choice of treatment in pelvic trauma.239 Anterior Odontoid Screw Fixation in the Elderly Patient: a CT-based Analysisof Risk Factor for Non-union", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF74": {"text": "Development of osseus union was not influenced by age of patient, the interval injury to index treatment nor by osseus healing surface.Introduction: Traumatic dislocation of the shoulder is an orthopedic emergency. To reduction under anesthesia or sedation is offered treatment method. Especially in army, at the battle field or combat training area might not be suitable using anesthesia or sedation. The aim of this study was to attract attention and show that how efficient of this technique. Material-Method: Between 2007 and 2008, 20 patients had isolated traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder joint were treated by ''chair reduction method'' (White, Parisien, Clotteau). A patient has shoulder dislocation is asked to sit on a chair in profile position without anesthesia or sedation. The patient's armpit is fitted to top of the chair's back. The top of the chair is supported by a pillow so that avoiding to axillar nerve damage or broken of humeral neck. Physician stands to behind the chair, grabs the patient's elbow, and applies vertical traction. A little external rotation may necessary (Milch, Hippocratic). The patient is not able to contract his muscles. There is not necessary to countertraction because of back of chair (Matsen). The patients' demographics were recorded. Results: Mean age was 22. After preparing period of chair method, all dislocations were reduced in less than 10 s. We did not face any complication. Conclusions: Giving education to residents about chair reduction method is recommended for using unsuitable circumstances. The chair method especially for young patients is reliable and practical method for reduction of shoulder dislocations.

Poor treatment results of the patients with pelvis injuries in specialized traumatologic departments are accounted for insufficient volume of medical care at the early period of treatment and, as a consequence -development of early posttraumatic complications. Methods: We present our experience of surgical treatment of 167 patients with pelvis fractures type B and C (M.Tile classification), associated with 449 nonpelvic injuries. ISS scale was 25-50 points. The mean age was 32.6 \u00b1 1.12 years. Males were 109 (65.3%), females 58 (34.7%). The treatment was carried out in parallel with the antishock measures on the resuscitation step. Stabilizing pelvis osteosynthesis was performed in 18 patients, early intervention -in 116, late operation -in 33. Patient hemodynamics was stabilized after stabilizing and early pelvis osteosynthesis; the volume of transfusion At operating table there was performed a satisfactory reposition of pelvic ring and a stable fixation in 91%. The patients after stabilizing osteosynthesis felt themselves more comfortable. They could change the position in bed, activated their regime. The treatment outcomes were evaluated according to S.A.Introduction and objective: To report on the results of a minimallyinvasive technique for the fixation of displaced proximal humeral fractures with a locked intramedullary nail (T2). Methods: All consecutive patients (in a single institution) with displaced proximal humeral fractures who were treated with an intramedullary T2 nail between 2004 and 2007 were evaluated. Thirtythree patients were included (mean age 78, m:f ratio 1:4). Fracture characteristics were classified according to AO and Neer. Follow-up included the Constant Score and the Shoulder Rating Questionnaire. Results: Eighteen patients had a two-part fracture, eleven patients had a three-part fracture and five had a four-part fracture. Functional outcome according to the Constant Score was excellent in nine, satisfactory in eight and poor in three patients. Subjective outcome was satisfactory to good for patients with two-part and three-part fractures but poor for four-part fractures. Major complications comprised four fixation failures, two cases of impingement and one deep infection. Avascular necrosis did not occur. Conclusions: Minimally-invasive fixation of displaced two-part and three-part humeral fractures in an elderly population shows satisfactory to excellent results in 80% of patients.

Operative fixation allows for early mobility and return to function, we describe the results of LISS plating in treating distal femoral fractures in 28 patients over the age of 55 years and discuss the outcomes and complications. Materials-methods: All patients over the age of 55 who sustained a distal femoral fracture, between August 2003 and December 2007, treated with a LISS plate were included in the study. The patients were reviewed clinically and radiologically and the degree of mobility at final follow up was assessed. A total of 28 patients were included with an average age of 79 years and mean follow up of 15 months. Results: 85.7% of fractures were secondary to falls and low energy trauma, 53.5% had intraarticular fractures. Interestingly, 39.2% of patients sustained peri-prosthetic fractures. Complications included three implant failures, nonunion in three patients, prominent metalwork in one patient and residual knee stiffness in one patient. Three patients required further procedures. The mortality rate was 7.1% with no incidence of superficial or deep infection noted and seven patients returned to their previous level of mobility. Conclusion: LISS plating is an effective treatment modality in treating distal femoral fractures with minimal soft tissue dissection however the technique requires a degree of experience and it is paramount that anatomical reduction be achieved prior to insertion of the implant.

Purpose: To evaluate the knee function and efficacy of intramedullary nailing and plate fixation in proximal third tibial fractures with or without joint extension. Patients and Methods: Over a 6 year period between 2001 and 2006 at two university settings, 105 proximal third tibial fracture were treated with either intramedullary nailing with static locking screws or minimal invasive plating. Sixty-one fractures (Group I) were treated with plates in a minimal invasive manner. Forty-four fractures (Group II) with closed reduction and intramedullary nailing. Prospective data acquisition were done in all patients. Radiographs were reviewed to determine fracture healing and alignment. Lysholm score was used for functional assessment and compared. Results: Sixteen patients could not be followed overall. The remaining 49 fractures in Group I united at an average of 20.2 weeks. The average union time in 40 fractures of group II was 22.5 weeks. Average follow-up period was 45.6 months in group I and 43.2 in group II. Acceptable radiographic alignment was obtained in 43 fractures in group I (87.7%) and 31 fractures in group II (82.5%). The mean Lysholm scores were 79 and 81 points in group I and II, respectively. The difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.53). Conclusion: Intramedullary nailing and minimal invasive plate fixation are both effective treatment modalities of proximal tibial fracture. Despite radiographic malalignment in some cases,the functional knee score was not different between two. Aim: Evaluate our results of treatment of type B2 periprosthetic femoral fractures (Vancouver classification) using a long-stem cementless femoral component with or without allograft. Material-methods: We reviewed the midterm follow-up of 16 femoral periprosthetic fractures around the stem with an unstable implant managed with a long-stem porous-coated femoral component.The average follow-up in this series was 5 years (minimum 2 years).The average age of the patients at the time of fracture was 78.3 years (range 66-91). Nine fractures were treated with a long stem porous-coated femoral component and seven were treated with additional allograft struts placed around the fracture and secured with cables. The patients were evaluated at 1, 3, and 6 months after the operation, and every year thereafter. Harris hip score, major complications and fracture-healing were assessed. Results: In the group without allograft all the fractures showed union; the average time to union was 3.4 months. In the group with allograft, one fracture showed nonunion; the average time to union was 3.3 months.There was no statistically significant difference between the union rate and the incidence of nonunion between the two groups (RR 1.29 (0.23-6.98). There were two patients in each group who developed deep infection. Nevertheless, no statistically significant difference was found (RR 1.2 (0.63-3.93). The mean Harris hip score was 55 points in the group without allograft and 49 points in the other group. This difference was not significant. Conclusions: A long-stem cementless femoral component is indicated for periprosthetic femoral fractures type B2. No better results were found with the use of an additional strut allograft.

Materials-methods: Retrospective review of multiple injured patients admitted to our Level 1 Trauma Center from 2002 to 2007. Inclusion criteria were: patients with ISS > 40, or polytrauma with pelvic fracture or abdominal injury in the presence of hemodynamic instability, or an AIS score of 2 for the torax, in whom a damage control procedure was the treatment for stabilization of long bone fractures. Thirty-one multiple injured patients with a total of thirty-eight long bones fractures met the criteria. Three patients died when they were in intensive care unit. The age of patients averaged 36 years. Twentyone were male and six were female. All the fractures had been caused by a high-energy trauma. Injury Severity Score averaged 37,07. Thirty-eight fractures were analyzed. Sixteen fractures were open. 58% of the fractures were secondary to a motor-vehicle accident and 20% to a fall. Conversion of the initial external fixation to internal fixation averaged 16.7 days. Rates of deep infection and fracture healing were the main outcome measurements. Results: All the fractures healed. Rate of deep infection was 2.7%. Conclusion: Damage control orthopedics in unstable multiple injured patients is a safe and effective method of treatment of the fractures of long bones. This approach reduces the systemic impact of surgery providing low infection rates.

Most of the plates allow insertion of either threaded locking screws or smooth locking pegs. No biomechanical studies are available comparing locking screws and pegs under axial and torsional loading. Materials and methods: Sawbones radii were used to simulate an AO/OTA A3 fracture. Volar fixed-angle plates (Aptus Radius 2.5, Medartis, Switzerland) with threaded locking screws (n = 5) or smooth locking pegs (n = 5) were used to fix the distal metaphyseal fragment. Each specimen was tested under axial compression and under torsional load. Qualitative parameters were recorded as well as axial and torsional stiffness, torsion strength, energy absorbed during monotonic loading, and energy absorbed in one cycle.Results: Axial stiffness was comparable (p = 0.818). If smooth pegs were used, a 17% reduction of torsional stiffness (p = 0.017) and a 12% reduction of minimum torque (p = 0.012) were recorded. A 12% reduction of energy absorbed (p = 0.013) during monotonic loading was recorded if smooth pegs were used. A 34% reduction of energy absorbed in one cycle (p < 0.007) was recorded if threaded screws were used. Sliding of the pegs was recorded at a mean torque of 3.80 \u00b1 0.19 Nm. No sliding was recorded if threaded screws were used. Discussion: According to the results of the present study using Sawbones, volar fixed-angle plates with threaded locking screws are mechanically superior to volar fixed-angle plates with smooth locking pegs. The theoretical rationale of using smooth locking pegs for volar fixed-angle plating is questionable and should be reconsidered.Lean Thinking-A Value Stream Pathway for Care of Hip Fractures Dip Chakrabarti, Taher Yousri, Zeeshan Khan, Richard Fernandes, Khaldoon Wahab 1 1 Good Hope Hospital, Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK Introduction: LEAN principles, derived mostly from the Toyota production system is now an emerging concept adopted by the National Health Service, in an attempt to optimize care with the use of available resources. This study aims to evaluate the impact of LEAN thinking application on the care of hip fracture patients. Materials and methods: Study included hip fracture patients admitted prior to application of LEAN from September 2005 to August 2006, who were compared with those admitted post LEAN from September 2006 to August 2007. Data collected included age, sex, type of fracture, and operation, door to theatre time (DT), length of hospital stay and mortality. Results: A retrospective study of 518 hip fracture patients over a 2 year period. Post-LEAN strategy application, the results in terms of the mortality rate and DT time were quiet impressive. Patients' 30 days mortality was reduced by 42.58 and 80.94% of patients went to theatres within 48 h. Discussion: LEAN thinking for the hip fracture patients focuses on improving the smoothness of the patients' flow from the time of their admission until they are discharged. Mapping the stream of patients allows identification of different problems in the pathway, cutting down on the steps which are identified as waste, thus improving the quality of care. Following the National Hip Fracture database guidelines, the stream is monitored by looking into door-to-theatre (DT) time, admission into trauma beds, pre and post operative medical assessment by the orthogeriatricians.

Different treatment options have been advocated with varying results. More recent studies have shown a high complication rate after nonoperative treatment of clavicle fractures. This study was done to evaluate indications, technical pitfalls and functional outcome of two surgical treatment options: elastic stable intramedullary nailing with titanium nails was compared with plate fixation. Methods: We report the results of a group of patients with clavicle fractures who underwent intramedullary nailing or plate fixation for stabilisation of their displaced midshaft and lateral clavicle fracture between 1998 and 2008. Both groups were compared. Outcome analysis included clinical follow-up, patient-oriented outcome and complication rates. Results: A total of 102 patients were included: 82 men (80.3%) and 20 women (19.6%). Only one patient had a medial clavicle fracture (0.9%), most had a midshaft fracture (60.8 vs. 38.3% lateral fractures). The mean age was 40.2 years old. Of all patients 45.0% was treated with intramedullary nailing, the other 55.0% with plate fixation. The rate of complications was higher in the intramedullary nailing group. Intramedullary nailing led to 39.1% complications (15% penmigration and 11% perforation of the skin) versus 14.2% in plate fixation (5.3% pseudarthrosis and 3.8% hardware failure). The functional outcome was good in almost all cases. Conclusions: More complications were found in the intramedullary nailing group. However, in both groups, the overall long-term follow up was good.

Surgical intervention is an accepted way of treatment of these fractures. The aim of this study is to evaluate the results of open reduction and internal fixation of closed displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures.Methods: In a period between 1995 and 2008, 33 patients (6 patients with bilateral fractures), 19-69 years old were treated surgically using the lateral extensile approach. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 10 years. The patients were evaluated radiographically by the X-ray appearance of Bohler's angle and calcaneal morphology. The evaluation was based also on the active range of motion, footwear problems and time off work. The short form 36 (SF-36) health status survey was used for outcomes assessment.Results: All fractures have been healed in an average time of 15 weeks. The outcome was excellent for 19 cases, good for 12 cases and poor for 8 cases.Conclusions: Open reduction and internal fixation is an effective method of treatment for displaced calcaneal fractures provided that the restoration of calcaneal height and talocalcaneal relationship is achieved.Introduction: Post-operative complications after total hip surgery and hip hemiarthroplasty can be reduced by the so called minimally invasive surgery (MIS) according to Bertin and R\u00f6 ttinger", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF82": {"text": "260 Exchange Reversed Arthroplasty for Failed Fracture Prosthesis: first Results Stefaan Nijs, Paul Broos 1 1 Departement of Trauma Surgery, UZ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium Introduction: Shoulder arthroplasty remains a valuable treatment for complex fractures of the proximal humerus. However the success of anatomical arthroplasty is mainly dependent of anatomical healing of the tuberosities. Even with specific prostheses and fixation techniques in 25-40% of cases anatomical healing is not achieved. In those patients suffering from pain, antero-superior instability and/or poor function reversed arthroplasty is proposed as solution. However in the friable patient revision arthoplasty with stem removal is a complex procedure complicated by iatrogenic fractures, delayed healing of the removal window and infection. Material-methods: We developed a specific reversed shoulder prosthesis allowing for revision arthroplasty without the need for stem removal. We included six patients in the revion reversed fracture arthroplasty group. Function is scored using the Constant Murleyscore. Radiographically we evaluate for evidence of scapular notching and iatrogenic fractures Complications are recorded. Results: At 6 months the mean Constant score is 42.5 points. There was no case of notching. There were no complications. In all patients pain scored better after revision. Function ameliorated significant in all patients. Conclusion: This relatively simple procedure results in less pain and an ameliorated functional status in all patients. However function does not recuperate on average to the same level as for rotator cuff arthroplatsty or primary reversed fracture arthroplasty.

Different treatment modalities can be used: shortening, segment transport, distraction ossteogenesis and the use of cancellous or structural autoand allografts. More recently the RIA system has been promoted to harvest bone grafts out of the femoral diaphyseal canal. We evaluate its use in the treatment of defect fractures. Material-methods: We treated eight patients with severe bone loss with bone grafts harvested from he femoral canal. There were three ulnar, three tibial, one radial and one humeral defects. The defect sizes did vary between 4 and 7 cm.Results: All but one fractures united within 4 months after graft application. No implant failure occured. In the patient with the radial defect there was an almost complete resorption of the graft. A second application of Ria graft after preparation of the acceptor site using the Masquelet technique, results in better healing. In one patient overreaming did cause a fissure in the femur. No additional treatment apart from partial weight bearing was necessary. In all other patients donor site pain subsided completely within 4 weeks of harvesting.

The new distal humerus system (Synthes \u00d2 ) is designed to provide better stability in osteoporotic bone and complex fractures by using locking head screws. Methods: Between 6/04 and 12/08, 34 patients were treated with the DHP-System. 22 patients (8 A-, 1 B-and 13 C-fractures; \u00d8 69.7 years) with a minimum follow-up of 22 months were included. Follow-up at 6, 12 and 52 weeks postoperatively. In addition, a free research follow-up visit under an approved protocol containing the Mayo Elbow Performance Index (MEPI), HSS-Score, DASH questionnaire, X-ray (ap/lat.), ROM, and the Broberg and Morrey Index (BMI) was performed. Results: 16 of 22 Patients with a mean follow-up of 29 months were able to participate the late examination. We found one asymptomatic nonunion, one preoperative and three postoperative sensory ulnar nerve damages which recovered incompletely in two patients. One CRPS two Implants were applied too distal, causing a painful impingement. \u00d8 ROM was F/E 129\u00b0/16\u00b0/0\u00b0. According to BMI, HSS-Score and MEPI the outcome was good (\u00d8 83; 86; 84 pts.). The DASH Score averaged at 24 pts. The mean flexion force of the injured elbow in percentage of the uninjured joint was 71%. No implant failure or loss of reduction. Conclusion: Supra-and intraarticular fractures of the distal humerus remain a surgical challenge. The anatomically pre-shaped plates and multiple locking screws simplify intraoperative handling and improve stable fracture fixation, especially in osteoporotic bone.Kritaya Kritayakirana, Sukanya Sriussadaporn, Rattaplee Pak-art, Supparerk Prichayudh, Suvit Sriussadaporn 1 1 Department of Surgery, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand Introduction: For the past 14 years our policy for diagnosing and treating cardiac trauma has not changed but the survival rate in our institute has markedly improved. Even though penetrating cardiac trauma has a better chance for survival in our series all four patients with blunt cardiac trauma survived. Methods: Patients presenting with suspected cardiac trauma will be managed initially according to the advanced trauma life support followed by focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST). Patients presenting in extremis with suspected cardiac trauma will receive emergency room thoracotomy in questionable FAST we will obtain formal transthoracic echocardiography. If still in doubt our policy will proceed with intra operative subxyphoid window and a set up for median sternotomy. Data was collected from retrospective chart review during September 1994 to September 2008. Results: Throughout the study period 42 patients had cardiac traumas the over all mortality rate was 14.2%. Four patients had blunt injury resulting in one ventricular septal defect and three ruptured right atrium. Right ventricle was injured the most 44%, right atrium 23%, left ventricle 20%, left atrium 2%, one patient had superior venacava injury and another patient had inferior venacava injury. Four patients had pericardial violation but no cardiac chamber injury. In this cohort 38% underwent emergency room thoracotomy. Associated injuries were presented ranging from craniotomy to intra abdominal injuries in 38% of cases. Conclusion: High index of suspicion and prompt management for cardiac trauma should be considered in patients presenting with injuries to the chest.265 Endovascular Treatment of Acute TraumaticThoracic Aorta Lesions", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF86": {"text": "need for intervention by tube thoracostomy in 65% of patients in this study.Introduction and objectives: Thoracic injuries are significant causes of morbidity and mortality in trauma patients, second only to head injuries for trauma-related deaths.

Cases were analyzed with regard to age, gender, type of residence (at village or town), type of biting animal, season, and site of injury. F\u0131nd\u0131ngs: Of all 487 cases, 366 (75.2%) were male and 121 (24.8%) were female. The mean age was 25.2 years (range: 1-90 years) and most patients were younger than 20 years old (52.6%). Half of the cases were living at villages (52.3%). Dog bites were the most frequent type (89.3%), followed by cat bites (5.9%), cow bites (1.6%), horse bites (1%), bear and fox bites (0.8%). Incidences were most frequently seen at June (16%) and July (12.5%). Most frequently injured sites were lower extremities (46.7% legs, 12% foot) and upper extremities (39.1%). Injuries to other sites including head, neck, thorax and abdomen constituted 2.2% of all cases. Of all animals, 61.1% were private property and 8% had received vaccination.

The external fixator according to Mitkovic enables unilateral fixation with convergent pins orientation, without any guidance. There is also possibility for compression, distraction and varus/valgus corection of the deformation. Methods: The result of external fixation in 42 patients with open tibial fractures (Gustilo Type II, IIIA, IIIB), average age 42.59 years old (19-69), are presented in this work. All fractures are treated with Mitkovic external fixator type M29, M20CD and M20CDV. Results: The results applied external fixation method are excellent and good. Union rate was 81%. Nonunion rate was 12%, malunion 7%.

Methods: We conducted a web-based survey between June 2006 and June 2007 consisting of 10 multiple-choice questions that was e-mailed to 278 upper limb surgeons. Results: 43% upper limb surgeons prefer neighbour strapping alone for non-operative management of little finger metacarpal fractures. Ulnar gutter cast or splint was the next choice among 19% surgeons while 13% respondents apply neighbour strapping to ring finger along with a splint. There was mixed response regarding period of immobilisation. 40% of surgeons were in favour of 3 weeks of immobilisation, 23% for 2 weeks while 28% do not immobilise these fractures at all. For surgical intervention, rotational deformity was the most common indication (84%), followed by open fracture (70%), intra-articular fracture (44%), associated 4th metacarpal fracture (26%), shortening > 5 mm (21%) and volar angulation -(15%). Follow up one visit was suggested at 3 weeks by 40% while 36% thought that no follow up is required. Conclusion: Many clinical studies have demonstrated that in the conservative care of boxer's fractures (casting, with or without reduction), between 20\u00b0and 70\u00b0of dorsal angulation is acceptable. The indications for operative intervention are open fracture, rotational deformity, intra-articular fractures and shortening. We conclude from our survey that there is no consensus even among the upper limb surgeons with regards to management of little finger metacarpal fractures in United Kingdom. Early Ankle Fracture Fixation Can Lead to Reduced Length of Stay: the Window of Opportunity Nanjunduppa Harshawardena, Ravi Bharadwaj, Ajay Sahu, Richard Hartley 1 1 Poole General Hospital, Poole, UK Introduct\u0131on: The aim was to compare the results and length of stay of patients of early ankle fracture fixation with conventional fixation in a hospital in UK. Methods: We collected data from case-records, clinical coding information and clinic letters. 200 patients who underwent ankle fracture fixation from July 2004 to June 2005 were included. We looked into age, place of living, Weber classification, mechanism of injury, comorbidities especially diabetes and peripheral vascular disease, smoking, anticoagulation, delay for theatre with reasons, length of stay in hospital and complications if any. Other things to look were overlying skin condition, the amount of swelling, talar shift needing reduction, injury types-open or closed or with associated neuro-vascular injury. In operative management -what method of fixation was used. Results: There were 200 ankle fractures that required surgical intervention. Only 22 of these had surgery within 12 h (mean length of stay, 3.3 days), and 67 of these had surgery within 48 h (mean length of stay, 4.9 days), and 111 had surgery after 48 h (mean length of stay, 9.4 days). Finally we calculated the cost (784 bed days -\u00a3235 thousands pounds) incurred to the trust in terms of extra bed occupancy and treating the complications as a result of wait. Conclus\u0131on: This study shows that early operative intervention for ankle fractures reduces the length of hospital stay. We want to emphasise on the 'Window of Opportunity' ie initial 12 h to fix ankle fractures to decrease overall morbidity & cost. The Conservative Treatment of Upper Cervical Spine Fractures in Children Ryszard Tomaszewski, Karol Pethe, Jacek Kler 1 1 Department of Pediatric Orthopedic and Traumatology, Silesian Medical University, Zabrze, Poland Background: The treatment of the upper spine fractures without displacement and neurological damage in children and adolescents is generally conservative. Material and method: From 01/2002 to 01/2007 12 upper spine fractures were treated. 1 patient with occipital condylar fracture, 5 with C1 fractures without displacement, 6 with C2 without displacement. The fractures were caused by a traffic accident in 6 cases, sport accidents in 4 cases, 2 the others. In 2 patients cervical fractures were accompanied by polytrauma. After accommodation in hospital XR, CT and MRI were used. All the patients were treated conservatively using the cervical spine brace for 85 days (66-125). Results: CT scan and XR cervical spine in flexion and extension 3 month after the treatment were used. In 1 patient XR shows the cervical instability C1_2 after C1 fracture needed the surgical procedure. Conclusion: The orthopedic treatment of the upper spine fractures without displacement is a save method with good results.

The clinical results of these cases were discussed in this study. All the patients were treated with minimally invasive technique without soft tissue dissection. Multi system trauma was observed in four patients. Posterior ligamentous injury was seen in three patients. All the cases were neurologically intact. The operations were performed by an experienced spinal surgeon without any complication. The average follow-up of the patients was 18 months. The local sagittal angles of all cases were measured preoperatively, postoperatively and at last follow-up. We found that postoperative adequate sagittal correction was obtained. We did not observe a significant increase in kyphosis at last follow-up measurements. With this technique, the well-known disadvantages of open surgery like, hemorrage, detachment of muscles and instability secondary to mucle insufficiency could be avoided. In suitable patients with AO type A thoracolubar fractures posterior instrumentation with percutaneous pedicular screw technique ia an effective treatment modality with advantages of minimal invasive surgery like, less pain compared with bracing, early mobilization without the need of a brace for multitrauma patients, using the advantages of posterior instrumentation in the prevention of postoperative kyphosis.As a result percutaneous pedicular screw fixation technique is a new and effective treatment option in spinal surgery as a minimal invasive method. Author to editor: Minimal invasive surgery is increasing its popularity over time. In spinal fracture fixation we have new mini invasive techniques. In this study the results of this technique was discussed. 521 VEGF Serum Concentrations in Patients with Long Bone Fractures Kambiz Sarahrudi 1 , Vilmos Vecsei 1 , Seyedhossein Aharinejad 2 1 Department for Trauma Surgery, University of Vienna 2 Laboratory for Cardiovascular Research, Center of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF175": {"text": "522 The Combined Osteosynthesis of the Children's Humeral Bone Diaphyseal Fractures Pakhriddin Mahamatovich Nizamkhadjaev, Takhirjan Timurovich Shadmanov Republican Research Center of Emergency Medicine, Tashkent, Uzbekistan RepublicIntroduction and objectives: The osteosynthesis of humeral bone fractures remains as a topical problem, quantity of these injuries reaches 14.5-16.2% among all fractures of long bones of extremities. Diaphyseal fractures reaches 13-25% cases of all injuries of a humeral bone(Klimovitsky V.G. 2003). The methodic of the combined osteosynthesis has been applied on 9 children with fractures of a humeral bone at the age of 6-13 years. 6 children had a radial nerve injury.Methods: In the department of children's traumatology of our clinic we applied the methodic of combined osteosynthesis: the combination of intramedullary osteosynthesis by Bogdanov's nail, and fixation of compressive-distraction Ilizarov's apparatus (hereafter CDA). First we place Bogdonov's nail intramedullary after an open reposition of bone fragments. After that we put on Ilizarov's devise consisting two half rings that fixate the pins which are taken through bottom and top third of humeral bone. The compressive-distraction Ilizarov's apparatus and Bogdonov's nail have been taken off on 24th-32nd day, after radiographic examination. Results: The healing of wounds passed with primary intention, the disordered innervations has been recovered within 1-2 weeks. We often observed restoration of the circulation immediately on an operating table within 30-40 min after stabilization of fragments. The recovery of elbow joint function has observed in the next 1-2 weeks after taking off the CDA. Conclusion: The combination of intramedullary osteosynthesis by Bogdonov's nail and CDA fixation allows to get stable osteosynthesis, and receive best results. Predicting Value of Different Commercial Quick Tests for Fracture Risk Assessment in Elderly Patients with Already Prevalent Proximal Femoral Fragility Fracture Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia Cohort study of patients above 65 with prevalent proximal femoral fracture. We checked the predicting value of different commercial quick tests for risk assessment in elderly people. We used quick test for predicting risk for fragility fracture of the Slovenian patient oriented society for osteoporosis, 2 commercial tests of the pharmaceutical industry and SF36 in elderly with fresh femoral fracture. The test of the Slovenian patient oriented society for osteoporosis does predict higher risk powerfully. Only 5 out of 20 patients were not recognized to be at higher risk for fracture. The two commercial tests did not confirm their validity. The patients with prevalent fracture were not estimated to be at higher risk for fracture! The SF36 test showed strong impact of prevalent fracture on life quality. The analysis shows fair predicting value of so called quick tests of RR in patients with prevalent osteoporotic fracture of the proximal femur. Their main benefit is to warm the elderly patient of osteoporotic fracture, but do not estimate the proper individual risk. Outcome of Intracapsular Femural Neck Fractures Treated with Cannulated Screw Fixation Sisto Riccardo, Daghino Walter, Gallo Alberto, Sacco Fernando, Zoccola Kristian, Biasibetti Antonio 1 1 Traumatology Department, CTO Hospital, Turin, Italy Introduct\u0131on: Femoral head-preserving treatment for femoral neck fractures with cancellous screws is a method widely performed. Treatment of intracapsular fracture varies according to the pattern of the fracture, patients age, bone quality, and comorbidities. Methods: We evaluated the surgical outcome following cannulated screw fixation of femoral neck fractures in 70 patients (Garden type I-IV fractures). All patients were treated between may 2003 and may 2007 by the same surgical equipe. The mean age was 44.3 years (range 25-65 years). Mean follow up was 49.8 months (range 12-64 months). Mean preoperative time was 49.2 h (range 2-220, median 24). WOMAC questionnaire and clinical documentation was used to evaluate patients outcome. Result: The mean pain, stiffness and physical functional score was, respectively, 77.3, 76.4, and 75.9 (best score:100, worst score:0). Eight patients undergone femural head necrosys, two patient had femural neck collapse, one developed pseudoarthrosis. Conclus\u0131on: A significant correlation was found between WOMAC score, patients age and comorbidity. There was no correlation between treatment outcome, follow-up time and preoperative time. Supracondylar Fractures of the Humerus in Children -Results of Surgical Treatment Sofia Isabel Vi\u00e7oso De Sousa Fernandes, Joel Reis, Vitor Caetano, Manuel Loureiro, Rui Cerqueira, Ramon Ferrero, Jos\u00e9 Fraga Ferreira 1 1 Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Guimar\u00e3 es Hospital, Guimar\u00e3 es, Portugal Introduct\u0131on: Supracondylar humerus fractures in children are common. Fractures without displacement usually undergo conservative treatment, but the one displaced usually require surgery with open or closed reduction. The purpose of this work is to analyze the fracture characteristics and compare the outcomes of the methods of treatment. Methods: This study was conducted from January 1998 to December 2007 and included 70 patients of Guimar\u00e3 es Hospital, who had type IIa, IIb or III according to the Wilkins modification of the Gartland system and underwent surgical treatment (closed reduction and percutaneous fixation with 2 k-wires or open reduction and fixation with 2 cross k-wires). Outcomes were measured according to Flynn criteria. Elbow motion and carrying angles were compared according to the surgical technique and fracture type and the data were analyzed. Results: There were 53 males and 17 females between 2 and 12 years (medium age 5,7); 3% were type IIa fractures, 32% IIb and 65% III. 95% had extension type fracture and 5% flexion. The medium charging angle were 4,46\u00ba in open reduction and 7,6\u00ba in closed. According to Flynn criteria the results in open reduction were excellent in 64% and good in 22%; and in closed were excellent in 34% and good in 33%. Conclusions: Closed reduction should be tried even in type III because it permits a good outcome, but the reduction is not anatomic and had compromised carrying angles. Open reduction had worse outcome, lost of extension, but is indicated when the fracture is irreducible by closed methods. 526 A New Distal Interlocking System for Tibia Intramedullary Nailing Fuat Akpinar 1 , Fatih K\u00fc \u00e7\u00fc kdurmaz 2 , Necdet Saglam 1 , Mustafa Tekke\u015f in 1 , Murat Durkaya 1 1 Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology, Umraniye Education and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey 2 Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology, Mus Governmental Hospital, Mus, TurkeyAlong with advantages of intramedullary nailing (IMN) of tibia but it has still some problems.

In this prospective study our results with this uncommon technique are presented. Mater\u0131als-Methods: From January 2006 until December 2007 there were 17 patients operated with this technique. Inclusion criteria were intraligamentary ACL lesions with open physes Tanner stadium I-III.Excluded were bony ruptures of the eminentia. A preoperative X-ray of the knee as well as an MRI were available for all patients. Tegner, Lysholm and IKDC scores were evaluated. After that the autologous ACL reconstruction with semitendinosus tendon was performed. Femoral fixation was done with a flip button, on tibial side with a bioabsorbable interference screw after direct scoping of the tibial tunnel with measurement of the epiphyseal plate. At follow up all scores were evaluated again and all patients were clinically examined. Results: Mean time to follow up was at 20.4 months (12-28 months). The mean age of the patients was at 13.8 years (9-15 years). All patients had excellent to good results in the scores used. There was no damaging of the epiphyseal plate until now. Conclusion: ACL reconstruction with autologous semitendinosus tendon and tibial fixation with a bioabsorbable interference screw at skeletally immature patients is a good alternative to the common procedures.

In order to gain more insight in the epidemiology and current treatment of these injuries this study was conducted. Patients and Method: Approximately 2,000 patients with hand injury were treated at the Emergency department of a level-2 trauma-centre in the last 3 years. The number of luxations at the MCP and IP joints was registered. Information of the trauma-mechanism and patient characteristics was collected.Results: Approximately 5 percent of all hand injuries involved traumatic luxation at the MCP and IP joints. A total of 94 patients were included in this study. In this population the most frequent luxations were located at either the 1st MCP or the 5th MCP and PIP joint. The majority of the cases where due to fall or sport injuries (55%). Overall the vast majority was treated with a plaster splint. Patient remained for 6 weeks under control. Patients were also evaluated by a short clinical exam after treatment. Patients who suffer from poor to moderate disabilities had flexion less than 60\u00b0and no ability for extension in MCP and IP joints. Normal function was restored in 49 patients, 45 were left with moderate to poor disability. and 12 patients were left with very limiting disability who where treated with surgery intervention.

In osteoporotic bones use of anglestable implants is advocated. A more simple method is the modification of a straight plate into a hook plate. Method: Out of the last plate hole a hook is created, that can be anchored in the small fragment. By excentric drilling in the other main fragment an axial compression of the fracture is achieved. If one single plate is not rigid enough, a second plate can be superimposed on the first one to strengthen the construct (e.g. on the olecranon). Results: The said technique was performed on fractures of the distal humerus, on olecranon fractures, on fractures of the distal radius, subcapital fractures of the distal ulna and on metacarpal fractures.

Evaluation of the Life Activities of the Highrisk, 75 Years and Older Patients who were Gone Under External Fixation for Pertrochanteric Fractures Ahmet Mutlu Vural, Ahmet Aybar, Mustafa Cevdet Avkan 1 1 Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Bak\u0131rk\u00f6 y Dr. Sadi Konuk Educational and Research Hospital, _ Istanbul, Turkey Purpose: To evaluate prospectively the life quality change of 75 years and older patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) values 3 and over, who were gone under external fixation surgery for pertrochanteric fractures. Mater\u0131als-methods: Thirty patients 75 years and older with pertrochanteric fractures, who were completed postoperative 6 months follow-up period were evaluated at the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6 y Dr. Sadi Konuk Educational and Research Hospital between March and May 2008. All the patients were ASA 3 and over. Twenty-one of the patients were female, nine of them were male. Mean age was 82 (75-92). All the patients were gone under external fixation surgery under general or regional anesthesia and were evaluated with Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living (BAI) preoperatively and at sixth month postoperatively. Results: All the fractures were healed completely. One patient had deep pin tract infection that was treated completely with antibiotics. Eight patients had superficial infection. Screw migration was detected in two patients. Twenty percent decrease was found between preoperative and postoperative BAI values. Conclus\u0131on: The external fixation surgery has the disadvantages of pin-tract infection, screw migration and undesirable cosmesis, but it is still an effective alternative surgical technique as it has the advantages of shorter surgery time, minimal hemorrhage, decreased cardiac risks and easy implant removal without general anesthesia. The decrease of BAI values was thought to be related with pertrochanteric fracture, additional systemic diseases and difficulty in aftertreatment. Complication and Failure of Spinal Instrumentation of Thoracolumbar Spine Fractures Mehmet Bulent Balioglu, Mehmet Akif Kaygusuz, Osman Cimen 1 1 3rd Orthopaedic Clinic, Ministry of Health Metin Sabanci Baltalimani Bone Diseases Education and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey Purpose: Management of thoracolumbar spinal fractures is one of the most controversial areas in modern spinal surgery. Pedicle screws or other implant instrumentation have been widely used for spinal stabilisation following spinal injury. Pedicle screw use in spinal stabilisatin has increased. Our aims are to highlight the topic of implant failure.Materials-Methods: Fourteen patients of unstable thoraco-lumbar fracture with or without neuro-deficit were treated by stabilisation with posterior pedicle screws enstrumentation. For the fracture classification system were used to Magerl/AO. The results were evaluated by neurological recovery (ASIA score), pain relief, VAS score and estimate of the implant failure.Result: Of these patients, 10 patients were male and four were female, average age 41. The condition causes included motor-vehicle accident in 4 patients, fall from height in 9 and working accident was 1. All of them received open reduction posterior internal fixation and posterior fusion, with an average follow-up period of 100 months. Patients had spinal fractures between the fourth thorasic and the fifth lumbar vertebral body (22 vertebra). According to the comprehensive classification, the 20 type A, 2 type B were identified preoperatively. The effect of implant failure was also evaluated. In the all patients broken pedicle screws were seen in 8 patients and a broken rod was seen 1 patient in the all patients. Implants were removed for 3 patients. VAS score was average 2.8. ASIA score was 1 patient C, 1 patient D and the others E. Conclus\u0131on: Back pain and function of these patients were all rated good. 8 patients with breakage of transpedicular screws and 1 patient was breakage of rod were encountered during follow-up, but there were no complaints.Treating Stable Odontoid Fractures: the Philadelphia Collar vs. Halo Thoracic Vest Michael Mayer 1 , Alexander Auffarth 1 , Herbert Resch 1 , Juliane Zenner 2 , Stefan Lederer 1 , Heiko Koller 2 1 Department of Traumatology and Sports Injuries, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria 2 German Scoliosis Center, Werner-Wicker-Klinik, Bad Wildungen, Germany", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF188": {"text": "548 Management of the Missed Fractures of the Talus Mahir Mahirogullari 1 , Osman Rodop 1 , Mustafa Akyuz 1 , Selami Cakmak 2 , Kenan Keklikci 1 , Can Solakoglu 1 , Mesih Kuskucu 1 1 GATA Medical Faculty Haydarpasa Training Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey 2 Aksaz Navy Hospital, Mugla, Turkey", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF189": {"text": ").

Ns Harshavardhana, Ajay Sahu, Simon Maret, Simon Richards, Paul Jairaj, Sunil Batra 1 1 Poole General Hospital NHS Trust, Dorset, England Aims and object\u0131ves: To review the existing coding for orthopaedic trauma, To ascertain accuracy of procedural codes, To identify limitations, implement changes, close the loop and re-evaluate. Study design: Complete audit cycle. Materials and Methods: All orthopaedic trauma surgeries (244 cases) performed over one month (March 2006) were comprehensively analysed. The primary procedural accuracy of OPCS4.2, its limitations and loss of revenue due to missing codes (6 patients) were determined. Electronic discharge summaries were implemented to enhance efficiency. The audit loop was subsequently closed to evaluate implementation of these changes by re-auditing all trauma surgeries performed in the same month the following year i.e. March 2007 (303 cases) against OPCS4.3 codes. Results: The primary procedural accuracy was 95.38% (11/238 coding errors) and omissions in 6 patients resulted in net loss of revenue of \u00a313,700 for March 2006. Following the closure of audit loop in March 2007 after implementation of changes, the primary procedural accuracy was 98.95% (3/286 coding errors) and cumulative loss of revenue due to omissions in 17 patients was \u00a346,750. D\u0131scuss\u0131on: Despite improvement in coding accuracy at the closure of audit loop, there were increased financial losses for trauma directorate. An in-depth analysis is being performed to identify lacunae (training/ staffing issues) as the trauma workload rose by 24.2% in a year. Conclus\u0131on: Accurate and ethical coding is challenging having impact on data quality, audit and research in addition to financial reimbursement.

Patients who sustain such fractures are usually elderly and frail, therefore reduction of the surgical ht is mandatory. A reduction of the surgical time, blood loss and need for transfusions using SCED with a MIPO technique has been reported. We wanted to compare the results of the treatment of SPF with a DHS inserted through a standard or a MIPO approach in a consecutive series of patients with attention to the surgical time, drop of haemoglobin and transfusions units. Mater\u0131al-Methods: Between January 2006 and January 2007 we treated forty patients for SPF. The patients received a 4 holes DHS plate and were randomly assigned to the Standard Group (SG) or MIPO Group (MG). In the SG a standard incision was used while in the MG the incision was reduced to a maximum of 6 cm. Differences in the surgical time, drop of haemoglobin and need of transfusion were registered. Results: The mean surgical time and mean drop of haemoglobin in the MG were significantly lower than those of the SG. Also the need for transfusion was significantly reduced in the MG. No major complication occurred in both groups. Conclusion: The treatment of SPF with a DHS through a MIPO technique has shown to be time saving in the OR, to limit the perioperative bleeding and to reduce the need for transfusions.

Despite the common occurence of AC joint dislocation no ideal surgical technique is known. Early and late postoperative complications are common including breakage of the implant, migration, loosening, clavicular erosion and postoperative arthritis. Methods: We present arthroscopic technique of AC joint stabilization with TightRope system (Arthrex). With arthroscope in subacromial place AC joint is cleaned and distal clavicular resection is performed to ensure complete clavicle reduction. Intraarticular access to coracoid is used through rotator interval. Coracoid is visualized. With drill guide C ring and cannulated drilling clavicle and coracoid tunnel is prepared. TightRope system (two titanium buttons connected by a heavy suture in a four strand configuration) is introduced through clavicle and coracoid. Clavicle is reduced under direct visualisation and the sutures are tied. This step completes the reduction and stabilization of the AC joint. Results: Technique is minimal invasive, safe and reproducible. Arthroscopic reconstruction yields to good functional and cosmetically pleasing results. No clinical or radiological loss of reduction were observed. Conclus\u0131ons: AC joint reconstruction and stabilization can be performed safely and effectively with arthroscopic technique which provides stable AC joint with good cosmetic result.

It is caused by the weakening of the ligaments and muscles that hold the rectum in place.It is associated with advanced age, long term constipation or diarrhea, childbirth, previous surgery, and sphincter paralysis. Trauma may cause sphincter paralysis and can be associated with rectal prolapse. It usually begins with prolapse of the rectum during defecation or Val Salva movement and usually progresses to a chronic stage. Long term prolapse can cause ulcerations, bleeding and in some cases perforation if not reducted. A 51-year-old male presented with rectal prolapse, bleeding, abdominal pain. He stated that he could not replace the prolapsed segment for 2 days and has been suffering for 20 years since after he fell from a tree and he had massive bleeding during the last 8 h. Physical examination revealed that a 15 cm segment of the rectum was prolapsed with the whole layers. There were ischemic and necrotic areas and active bleeding from the mucosa. Reduction trial was not successfull. Emergent laparotomy was performed. Bimanual reduction failed.Thus transanal intervention, with sigmoid resection was performed. End colostomy was preferred.

In order to achieve satisfactory treatment results trauma treatment team must include a maxillofacial surgeon.Mater\u0131al-Methods: The study shows treatment results of 29 polytraumatized patients with maxillofacial injuries. Dominant trauma was: maxillofacial in 17%, craniocerebral in 38%, locomotor in 17%, thoracic in 14% and abdominal in 14% of cases. Treatment of maxillofacial trauma was in 28% of cases surgical and in 72% conservative. Treatment of other traumas was operative in 17% and conservative in 83% of patients. Results: Early mortality rate was 21%. Four exitus were recorded during the first 24 h, 1 exitus on the 4th day and 1 exitus on the 6th post-trauma day. Dominant trauma was in 4 exitus craniocerebral, in 1 exitus thoracic and in 1 exitus severe locomotor. Long-term treatment results in remaining 23 patients were: for maxillofacial regiongood in 16 patients (70%), satisfactory in 3 patients (13%) and poor in 4 patients (17%); for other regions -good in 20 patients (87%), satisfactory in 1 patient (4%) and poor in 2 patients (9%). Conclus\u0131on: Existing maxillofacial trauma in polytraumatized patients usually directs treatment toward conservative methods.Reasons for this are insufficient number of maxillofacial surgeons in trauma teams and delay of surgical treatment of other present traumas due to difficult anesthesia application. Unfortunately, conservative treatment approach induces inadequate treatment results from both functional and esthetic point of view. However, as revealed by hospitalization, transportation, and mortality data, women were exposed to more severe trauma. In addition, poisoning and fall caused more death. The rate of mortality of women seems to be less when compared to literature. Conclus\u0131on: Bicyclists in non-fatal frontal crashes with cars suffered the most serious injuries from the impact to bonnet and windshield, likely due to highest energy transformation. Bicycle helmets, collision mitigation system that alerts the driver or automatically brakes the car, and external airbags protecting the bicyclists from hitting bonnet and windshield, may reduce injuries.Author to editor: This is a complete analysis of mechanism of injury in crashes carfront versus bicyclist.

Third impact in 42 patients gave 29 injuries (16 head/neck) at windshield (9 AIS 2 +) or street (4 AIS 2 +). Thirteen persons, who hit the street as the fourth impact point, sustained three injuries (zero AIS 2 +) as contusions of the pelvis and lower back. Conclus\u0131on: Pedestrians in non-fatal frontal crashes with a car suffered the most serious head injuries at second impact in bonnet, windshield or street. Safer passageways for pedestrians might preclude the crash. Mechanisms preventing the pedestrian of hitting the bonnet and windshield, may reduce the injuries.

One of the primary characteristics which professions possess is to make the members of a profession have autonomy in decision making and practice. Nursing practice is evaluated in relation to professional practice standards and guidelines, rules, etc\u2026 Application of professional standards requires that nurses use critical thinking for the good of individuals or groups. Critical thinking also requires the use of scientifically based and practiced-based criteria for making clinical judgments. These criteria may be practice based on standards developed by clinical practice guidelines developed by individual clinical agencies. For example, intensive care units (ICUs) are designed to meet the special needs of acutely and critically ill patients. A patient is generally admitted to the ICU for one of three reasons. The patient may be physiologically unstable, at risk for serious complications and require intensive and complicated nursing support. Despite the emphasis on caring for the patient who can survive death is common in ICU patients. It is reported that 10% of patients admitted to ICUs will die, and another 20% may leave the ICU but will not survive to discharge. This suggests a need for caution and coordination of care when transferring patients from ICUs to general units. In this article, the practice guideline which titled ''Patient Appropriateness for Adult ICU Admissions and Discharge'' will be discussed. The terminology for pelvic fractures and its recent modifiers are confusion to the trainee to say the least. We surveyed 70 orthopaedic trainees in the latter part of their surgical rotations. The same set of radiographs were shown to all trainees and their classifications recorded. the same set of radiographs were shown to the trainees again after a period of 21 days. We found significant inter-observer variability (45%) and wide intra-observer variability (15%). Though trainees were adept at identifying basic fractures patterns and identifying individual column or lip/wall fractures the complex fracture patterns seems to generate different answers from the same observer at different times. The CT scan was the most effective tool identified for accuracy of the fractured fragments but the more complex assignments resulted in the trainees grouping them differently. Results: Twenty-one fractures (87.5%) healed without complication including five fractures where external fixation was converted into internal one. The mean time to union was 6.5 (4-9) months. There were two pin-track infections, two deep infections, and only one nonunion. The femur length was equal to the healthy side in 19 cases, and was shorter by 1-2 cm in five cases. Mean active knee flexion was 90\u00b0. Knee flexion was more than 110\u00b0in 9 patients. Conclusions: External fixation is a useful technique for the stabilization of severe open and close highly comminuted femoral shaft fractures. It is safe procedure to achieve temporary rigid stabilization of femur fracture in critical polytraumatized patients before delayed internal fixation (damage control orthopedics).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Influence of Maxillofacial Trauma in Polytraumatized Patients on Long-term Treatment Results"}, {"text": "purpose of this study was to determine the factors predicting mortality.Methods: A retrospective study was performed on 174 cases of pelvic fracture who visited to Emergency Department from January 2003 to June 2008.

Methods: The mean age was 39.1 years. A straight posterior surgical incision was performed. A thin oscillating saw was used to begin the olecranon osteotomy. A small osteotome was then inserted and the osteotomy was completed through the subchondral bone. The posterior elbow capsule was incised. The olecranon fragment and the triceps muscle were reflected proximally to expose the distal humeral articular surface. Osteotomy fixations were performed with two intramedullary Kirschner wires and dorsal tension band in 23 patients. In four patients, an intramedullary screw and a tension band were used for fixation. Results: At the final control, the Jupiter Classification system was used for the evaluation of the patients. Eighty one percent of the patients revealed good and excellent results at the long-term followup. None of the patients showed osteotomy nonunion. The most frequent complication was skin problem due to subcutaneous prominence of the implants.Conclusions: The goals of treatment of distal humerus fractures are anatomic articular restoration and rigid fixation. Olecranon osteotomy provides good visualization for rigid fixation especially in Type C distal humeral articular fractures. This is a useful method for excellent anatomic reduction of the articular surface.

Introduct\u0131on: The population who applied to the public emergency services due to the injuries related to butchering the sacrificial animals during the feast of sacrifice were evaluated. Mater\u0131als-Method: Eighty-nine patients who admitted to the emergency services in Kirikkale during the feast of sacrifice in 2008 were evaluated according to age, sex, application day and time, state of experience, type and mechanism of injury and medical treatment. Results: The age average was 43 \u00b1 13 and 80% of them were male. Eighty-eight percent of the patients admitted in the first day. Seventy percent of the injuries were penetrating injuries and 30% of them were blunt. The average time passed after the trauma was 120 min. Almost half of the cases were wounded with a knife, 18% were wounded unintentionally by the others and 36% of the cases were due to hit of animals. Fifty-seven percent of the patients had butchering experience before. Ninety-one percent of the cases were hand injuries. Thirty percent of the cases had fractures. Nine percent of all cases had tendon injury, 55% of the cases were treated primarily skin suturation. Conclus\u0131on: The injuries related to butchering of the sacrificial animals sometimes can be serious. In extremity injuries, the number of tendon cuts and bone fractures can not be underestimated. Both equipments and medical staff support for the injured people should be provided and preliminary arrangements should be done during the feast of sacrifice. Every butchering job in this period should be given to professionals. Introduction: Osteoporotic fractures of the trochanteric area are often treated with a gamma-nail or similar implants utilizing a screw applied into the femoral head. One of the main problems of these techniques is the cut out in the femoral head. We biomechanically evaluated a novel technique of cement augmentation of the bed of the screw in a standardised osteoporotic bone model and its capability to reduce the cut out rate. Material and methods: Utilizing a polyurethane-foam osteoporotic model that has been previously described (specific gravity 0.192 g/cm 3 ), a biomechanical testing of a neck of femur screw (TGN, STRYKER, Duisburg, Germany) was performed. The screw was implanted according to manufacturers instruction, the migration characteristics were then biomechanically tested (Zwick testing machine) with a static stepwise load increase (50 N). First these tests were performed without, in a second series with the augmentation of a fast hardening biopolymer (Corthoss, Orthovita, USA). Each series was repeated five times. The transfer from a stable to an unstable condition was biomechanically determined.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ". Vacillation and anxiety in indication of conversion"}, {"text": "Results: On average the applied load at the moment of failure with critical cut out was 1431 N for the non-augmented screws. With augmentation, the average load was 1,987 N, the difference was statistically significant.Discussion: It appears in biomechanical testing that augmentation of the femoral head can improve the load bearing capabilities and thereby possibly reduce the rate of cut-out failure in osteoporotic bone. We proceed now with further biomechanical testing, grant of the local ethics committee for human testing has been applied for. Introductions and object\u0131ves: The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between childs' favourite cartoon stars who can fly and falling down from a high place in two cases. Methods: In this paper we presented two similar cases who were seen with a history of falling down from a high place. The first case was a 4-year old girl who fell down from the third floor of their apartment. On her examination it was learned that she wanted to fly like her favourite magical cartoon star girls. The second case was a 5-year old boy who fell down from the second floor. While falling down he was screaming to his friends that he was flying.Results: On the physical examination of the first case, deformity and crepitation in right femur were found. X-rays showed right femur distal epiphysis Salter Harris type IV fracture. She was hospitalized due to the pneumothrax in pediatric surgery intensive care unit. The procedure of closed reduction and fixation with multiple kirschner wires was performed under general anestesia. Closed body fracture in the left femur was found in case II. Introduct\u0131on: The purpose of this study was to compare the biomechanical properties of different possibilities of screw placement in multidirectional palmar fixed-angle plate in distal radius osteotomy cadaver model under loading conditions. Methods: An extra-articular fracture was created in 16 pairs of fresh frozen human cadaver radii. The 32 specimens were randomized into four groups. All radii were plated with a volar fixed-angle plate. There were 4 different possibilities of screw placement in the distal fragment:Group a: 4 screws were used in the distal row of the plate. Group b: 4 screws were used alternately in the distal and proximal row. Group c: 3 screws were used in the proximal row. Group d: 7 screws were used filling all screws holes in the distal and proximal row of the plate.The proximal fragment was fixed with 3 screws each. The specimens were loaded with 80 N under dorsal and volar bending and with 250 N axial loading. Results: Group d had the highest stiffness of 429 N/mm under axial compression and was statistically significant stiffer than the other groups. Group b had a stiffness of 208 N/mm followed by group a with 177 N/mm. Group c showed only a stiffness of 83 N/mm. There were no statistically significant differences under dorsal and volar bending.Conclus\u0131ons: Occupying all screw holes in the distal fragment offered the highest stability. Using only the proximal row with 3 screws showed an unstable situation. It is therefore recommended to use at least 4 screws in the distal fragment. Perilunate dislocations are the most common type of carpal dislocation. They can be produced by high-energy injuries. The population primarily at risk is male young adults. In perilunate dislocations, the proximal articular surface of the lunate retains contact with the distal radius. The dorsal-perilunate/volar-lunate dislocation is more common. We performed a retrospective study of perilunate dislocations from 2006 to 2008. A total of 5 were reviewed. Mean age of the patients was 28.6 (range 18-48). All the patients were male. The trauma mechanism was fall from height in 3 and motor vehicle accident in 2. All the dislocations were dorsal-perilunate/volar-lunate dislocations. All the dislocations were together with ipsilateral scaphoid fractures. All were closed injuries and all were reduced by closed reduction maneuvers. Percutaneous pinning was applied for the dislocation and scaphoid fractures. Mean follow-up time was 11 months (range 6-18 months). When compared with the non-injured wrist, there was limited range of movement in only one patient.No limitation of range of motion in the other patients could be obtained. The patients did not have pain and instability. Radiologically no arthrosis of the wrist could be obtained but in all patients there was scaphoid pseudoarthrosis. Functional range of motion of the wrist after a perilunate dislocation is independent of the concomitant scaphoid fractures.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "MRI Guided Kypho-and Vertebroplasty on a Spine Model"}, {"text": "Bostjan Sluga, Tomaz Malovrh 1 1 Traumatology Department, University Clinical Centre, Ljubljana, SloveniaInfective complications of tibia fractures result in nonunion, bone defects and soft tissue envelope impairment. Several methods of treatment have been described to deal with bone defect including callus distraction, fibula transfer, muscle flap and bone grafting. There are many possibilities to encourage bone healing; bone morphogenic proteins, platelet rich plasma, electrical, ultrasound or shockwave stimulation and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. A patient with both tibias infected nonunion is presented. High energy trauma primarily and inadequate debridement secondarily were probably the cause of the healing complications. A middle-age man was injured in a gas explosion and suffered comminuted closed fractures of both distal tibias. After an immediate external fixation we operated him on the 28th day after the injury, anatomical reduction and internal fixation on both sides was done. An infection developed after 3 weeks. Ankle joint arthrodesis was necessary on one side and implant removal, repetitive debridement with bone grafting on the other. We could not cure the infection and the fracture did not heal. After 2 years, 7 operations, 277 days of ciprofloxacin, 60 days of gentamicin, 57 days of vancomycin, 40 days of implanted gentamicin antibiotic beds and the use of cultivated autogenous steam cells clinically evident nonunion was still present. Surgery was performed again, a resection of 9 cm of bone and callus distraction with an unilateral frame. Despite a fast progress in knowledge and improvement of methods, a radical debridement, preservation or reconstruction of soft tissue coverage, systemic and local antibiotic therapy and appropriate stabilization is still a keystone in infected nonunion treatment. Some people who live in some regions of our Country trust in bonesetter's skills more than these ones of professional orthopaedist in the hospitals. The fact that some bonesetter's particular skills to cure the non-operative back pain seems to make them credible on closed reduction too. In this case report, right humerus proximal body fractures due to falling were discussed. The case was 9-year-old male. In the treatment of this case, velpau bandage, closed reduction and plaster cast-splint has been applied after that he was called to the clinic control, but he did not come to control. The parents of the case were aware of the fact he cannot raise enough the right upper extremity and he was taken along to the hospital. From his anamnesis, it has been learnt that the bonesetter has removed the castsplint and, tried to perform closed reduction. Actual physical examination showed that there was an arm pain, crepitation and deformity. A diagnose has been made: there was an union right humerus proximal body fractures, so he has to be hospitalised. Under general anaesthesia, closed reduction and bandage Velpeau were applied. On the 3rd day of the hospitalisation, the case was externed and was advised to come for a polyclinic control. Because of the importance of epiphysis lines of bones and of other complications from the upper extremities fractures, the treatments have to be performed by the orthopaedists or in accordance with them. About this medical issue, families should be made conscious by healthy authorities. There were 3 women and 20 men. The mean age was 39.7 years (range 19-55 years) and mean follow-up period was 23 months (range 9-56 months). Posterior Kocher-Langenbeck approach was used at 21 patients and ilioinguinal approach was used at two patients.Results: There were 10 both column, 6 posterior column with posterior wall, 4 transverse with posterior wall and 3 posterior wall fractures. Anatomic reduction was obtained at 18 patients and adequate reduction at 5 patients according to Matta criterias. Harris scoring system revealed excellent at 13, good at 4, moderate at 2 and bad at 4 patients. Over 70% of these patients had satisfactory function. There were any pulmonary embolism, deep infection or nonunion detected. One of four patients whom had developed osteoarthritis, managed with total arthroplasty. Postoperative sciatic nerve injury was developed at one patient. Conclus\u0131on: Secondary arthrosis, nonanatomic reduction, unstable fixation and nerve injuries were associated with poor results.

Particularly people with chronic diseases (such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure and gout) are prone to develop quadriceps muscle ruptures. We present a case of partial rupture of the quadriceps muscle in a 4-year-old girl after intramuscular injections. We thought that this patient could be the youngest patient reported with a quadriceps muscle rupture. Methods: Patient presented to our clinic with left knee pain, limitation in knee flexion and a localized palpable swelling at the anterolateral side of thigh. There was no blunt trauma but it happened while she jumping on the sofa. In her detailed history we learnt that she had a serious upper tract respiratory infection a week ago and used some parenteral antibiotics (twice a day, intramuscular Clindamycine for 7 days).Results: Plain radiographies were normal. MRI showed a partial tear of the vastus lateralis muscle matching with the injection sites. The patient was placed in a long leg half-cast which was maintained for 3 weeks. She treated with conservative treatment successfully.Conclusions: MR imaging is useful to diagnose and differentiate in this pathology. Multiple intramuscular injections may contribute to damage muscles and make them prone to tears with muscle contractions. Quadriceps muscle ruptures in children can be treated successfully with conservative treatment. Twenty year old female attempted suicide by jumping from a four story high building, resulting in multiple fractures of the limbs and a complex fracture of the body of the fourth lumbar vertebra (L4) resulting in paralysis of the inferior limbs. The L4 fracture was treated by a Neurosurgeon with the extraction of the body of the vertebra, insertion of a cage device and arthrodeses of the third and fifth vertebras using a metal plate and screws, thereby stabilizing the affected segment and decompressing the medullar channel. The approach was achieved by a General Surgeon using the technique of Localio, that consists in a paramedian incision of the abdomen and the dissection of the retroperitoneal space without entering the abdominal cavity, dissecting and isolating the left ureter and the main vascular structures (iliac vessels and the left iliolumbar vein) in order to allow a good exposure of the three vertebra bodies involved. The patient recovered the complete function and control over the limbs, resulting no neurological sequelae from the fracture. It is of major importance that this procedure be performed by a multidisciplinary team of surgeons, involving a Neurosurgeon and a General Surgeon, in this way achieving a better result and a lower risk of complications.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Trauma-related Amputations at Emergency Department: an Epidemiologic Study"}, {"text": "Josef M\u00e4rz 1 1 Department of surgery, Regional hospital Karlovy Vary, Czech RepublicAbdominal ultrasonography or CT were applied to 5 (62.5%) patients with blunt trauma and 8 (34.7%) patients with penetrating trauma. One (12.5%) negative laparotomy was applied to patients with blunt trauma. 2 to 3 splenic injuries was splenectomy. 1 sigmoid perforation, 1 diaphragm rupture, 1 bladder rupture were observed and were fixed primarily. One patient died during surgery due to liver and vena cava injuries. Patients with penetrating injury were operated due to firearm injury in 6 (26%) and stab wound in 17 (74%), mortality was not. Negative laparotomy was applied to 5 (21.7%) patients. Multiorgan injury was observed in 6 patients. Tube thoracostomy was inserted to 4 patients. 6 of the intestine injuries and stomach injury was fixed primarily. Two resection and anastomose and three diversionary ostomy were done. Conclusion: Proper examination must be considered according to the formation of trauma. _ Imaging methods have been used less in penetrating trauma, and negative laparotomy is reported to be applied more than in cases of blunt traumas Introduct\u0131on: Chest tube insertion is frequently used by thoracoabdominal surgeons in urgent conditions. Occasionally, this invasive procedure may be associated with lethal complications in inexperienced hands. In this study, we analyzed 6 patients with visceral and/or diaphragmatic injuries due to chest tube insertions. Methods: Six patients with diaphragmatic and visceral injuries subsequent to chest tube insertions between 2003 and 2006 were evaluated. The diagnosis was established with roentgenogram, biochemistry of the fluid drained from the chest tube and confirmed with computerized tomography in all patients. Results: Pleural effusion accompanying respiratory distress was the main indication for chest tube insertion in all patients. In five patients, coexistent gastric perforations with diaphragmatic ruptures were detected, also the esophagus was additionally perforated in one patient. Partial gastrectomies were performed in three patients, whereas total gastrectomy in one and primary repair required in two patients respectively. Five of the patients died from septic complications. The only survived patients with early diagnosis and primary repair was discharged from the hospital on the 12th day. Conclus\u0131on: Penetration of a drainage tube through viscera is a wellrecognized but seldom reported phenomenon. In the majority of patients with diaphragmatic rupture, abnormalities can be found at initial chest radiography. If transdiaphragmatic herniation is missing, diaphragmatic rupture is difficult to diagnose by chest radiography alone. Computed tomography is often necessary to reveal the correct diagnosis. Early diagnosis and treatment are extremely important in the management of these patients. Bronchobiliary fistula is a rare condition, arising as a complication of hydatid disease of the liver, hepatic tuberculosis, hepatic malignancy, chronic pancreatitis, hepatic trauma or surgery. Conservative treatment is directed at non-surgical approaches of relieving biliary obstruction to allow for normal flow of bile into the duodenum via endoscopy or percutaneous routes. However in complicated cases which failed conservative non-surgical therapy, surgical intervention is usually required. We report a 35-year-old man who presented with bilioptysis from a bronchobiliary fistula resulting from firearm injury after 15 days. For his current admission, the patient reported a 5-day history of cough productive of yellow-green sputum coupled with fevers and malaise.This was successfully treated surgically with a right medial lobectomy and t-tube drainage. Paget-von Schroetter Syndrome(PSS) refers to spontaneous thrombosis of the subclavian vein and constitutes 0.5-1% of all venous thromboses. It is prevalent among young and healthy adult males who engage in sports. A 42-year-old male presented with pain and swelling of the left arm after a sequence of intense, repetitive weight lifting exercises. Upon questioning, He disclosed that he had been engaged with weight lifting for a long time and had complaints for a while. Bases on these findings, upper-extremity effort thrombosis was suspected. Contrast-enhanced MR Angiography revealed near-complete occlusion of the proximal left subclavian vein and collateral formations in the distal were observed. Color Doppler US showed a heterogeneous thrombotic mass that filled almost the entire proximal segment of the left subclavian vein thrombosis extended into the proximal segment of the left internal jugular vein. Furthermore, extensive venous collateral formations were present the left proximal cervical localization. Both MR angiographic and sonographic findings were consistent with PSS. As the patient had already developed extensive venous collaterals, no surgical intervention was performed. Instead, treatment with lowmolecular weight heparin and anticoagulants, was initiated and was continued along with the follow-up for bleeding parameters. As of 3 years clinical follow-up the patient is doing well, and treatment is continued with oral anticoagulants and acetylsalicylic. PSS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of effort induced upper extremity pain and swelling. Conservative non-operative treatment is acceptable and can be successfully used with favorable long-term outcomes. Although, blunt trauma of the extremities is a common diagnosis in emergency clinics, compartment syndrome associated with vascular injury following blunt trauma may be difficult to diagnose. Urgent diagnosis and treatment of compartment syndrome is of particular importance for limb salvage or even to save the patients' life. 43 years old male patient was referred to emergency clinic due to blunt trauma of the right lower extremity. Right thigh was echimotic and swollen. Pallor, coldness and severe pain were present at the lower part of the trauma level. Distal pulses were not palpable. Acute compartment syndrome of the right thigh was diagnosed that led to an emergent operation. Intraoperatively, popliteal artery rupture was diagnosed and repaired with end-to-end anastomosis. Fasciotomies were performed at the anteromedial and anterolateral portions of the right leg and anteromedial part of the thigh for the treatment of compartment syndrome. In early postoperative period, distal pulses were palpable. Preoperatively present pallor and coldness improved in the first few h. Fasciotomies were closed with skin grafts at the 10th postoperative day. Patient was discharged at the 19th postoperative day with palpable distal pulses and failure of dorsal flexion of the right ankle representing mild neurological injury. Possible vascular injury should be kept in mind in a patient with compartment syndrome following blunt trauma of extremities. Success of surgical repair depends on the early diagnosis and treatment. Late repair may result in neurological complications or even the loss of extremities.Conclus\u0131on: Acute mesenteric ischemia is highly mortal emergency which should always be suspected in elderly patients with cardiac disease suffering from abdominal pain.624 Acute Ischemia of the Lower Member after Injury by Firearm -Case Report Patient with 48 years, male sex, admitted at the Urgency Department after injury of the left lower member by firearm. At the admission presented loss of substance and hemorrhage in the medial and lateral faces of left leg and foot with signs of ischemia. An arteriography of the member was carried out showing infrapopliteal arterial lesions of the three axes. During surgery, fracture and losses of peroneum substance was observed with macroscopic tibial and peroneal common nerves integrities. He was submitted to tibial interposition grafts with subsequent reversed contralateral internal saphena vein bypass.In the 21th postoperative day it was carried out surgical debridement and plastia with partial skin graft. He presented good cicatricial evolution, with hospital discharge 7 days after, oriented to external consultations of Vascular Surgery, Plastic Surgery, Physical/ Rehabilitation Medicine and Pain Consult. Five months after surgery, pain was controlled with the medication instituted, with improvement of the left lower member limitations with physiotherapy, good cicatricial evolution and posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses palpables. D\u0131scuss\u0131on: The incidence of arterial wounds following penetrating injury of the members is 10%. The vascular trauma occurs more frequently in the lower extremities, being the most common clinical presentation acute isquemia. The most frequent causes are vehicle accidents, falls and firearm wounds. In the United States, injuries by firearm represents the first cause of death in young individuals of male sex. The arterial bellow-knee injuries by firearm remain like a challenge, with an associated rate of amputation of 20 to 54%.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Resorbable Implants -Suitable Alternative"}, {"text": "Jorge Pereira, Luis Filipe Pinheiro 1 1 Surgery Department, S\u00e3 o Teot\u00f3 nio Hospital, Viseu, PortugalTrauma represents one of the most important causes of death and disability of today.

This fact has produced great improvement, proven and reproducible, decreasing mortality and morbidity of trauma. The next stage of treatment implies surgery. The DSTC course, and other similar ones, allow the teaching of surgical damage control to surgeons. In this courses, the surgeon not only learns the theoretical basis of the surgical techniques but also acquires the skills to perform them. More importantly, he learns trauma pathophysiology, so he can perform the difficult task of surgical decision-making. Using the same computer-animated drawing technique as in a previous video (Primary Survey), the authors continue to present a trauma patient, after the stabilization of the Primary Survey, at the Operating Room. The patient has a severe abdominal trauma and needs Damage Control of his lesions, for he is already suffering from the deadly triad: hypocoagulation, acidosis and hypothermia. A 66 year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital for severe abdominal pain. Thoracoabdominopelvic CT scan demonstrated incarcerated bowel loops in the right hemithorax. Strangulated transverse colon segment and omentum through the defect at the dome of right diaphragma was found at diagnostic laparoscopy. Diaphragmatic hernia was primarily repaired with endostitches, and supported with a polipropylene mesh fixed with endotuckers subsequent to reduction of strangulated organs to the abdomen. Resection of necrotic intrabdominal organs and a side-to-side stapled colocolonic anastomosis was performed through a subcostal minilaparotomy. Drainage of right hemithorax was provided with a tube thoracostomy. The patient was discharged on the 5th post-operative day without any major complications. Introduction And object\u0131ves: Single incision laparoscopic procedures are accepted as a step towards pure natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery. However, loss of requirement of any perforation of visceral organ and an endoscopic equipment make this technique more popular and easily performable.
