The results showed that DcR3 was secreted in HUVECs through the NF-\u03baB pathway. Transcription factor NF-\u03baB participates in cell proliferation, apoptosis, immune inflammation and tumorigenesis, and activation of NF-\u03baB reportedly promotes the expression of DcR3. Xia et al. (2012) found that when the human pancreas cell line ASPC-1 was challenged with LPS or TNF-\u03b1, the active NF-\u03baB up-regulated DcR3 expression. Meanwhile, Chen and Yang (2008) found that human intestinal epithelial cells secreted DcR3 through TLR/PI3K/ NF-\u03baB regulation, and Ho et al. (2007) found that the EB virus promoted DcR3 expression by activating NF-\u03baB [43] [44] [45] . The NF-\u03baB pathway was critically involved in the molecular mechanisms underlying the action of EGFR and inflammatory cytokines [46] . In our present research, we also found that DcR3 was up-regulated via the NF-\u03baB pathway in the sepsis cell models.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1429, "end": 1446, "text": "Xia et al.

In cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis mouse models, DcR3 protein treatments markedly improved survival in septic mice, reduced the inflammatory response, and decreased lymphocyte apoptosis in the thymus and spleen [8] . In the present study, we found that elevated DcR3 levels in septic cell models proceeded through the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway, as did DcR3 secretion in HUVECs stimulated by LPS, LTA or zymosan. Taken together, the emerging evidence suggests that DcR3 plays an important role in sepsis and may be a therapeutic target for sepsis treatment.
