This vast amount of new information makes possible more comprehensive and accurate target identification using several new computational approaches, including identification of metabolic \"choke-points\", searching the parasite proteomes for orthologues of known drug targets, and identification of parasite proteins likely to interact with known drugs and drug-like small molecules. In this chapter, we describe several databases (such as GENEDB, BRENDA, KEGG, METACYC, the THEM-PEUTIC TARGET DATABASE, and CHEMBaNK) and algorithms (including PATHOLOGIC, PATHWAY HUNTER TOOL, AND AUTODOCI0 which have been developed to facilitate the bioinformatic analyses underlying these approaches.

Most existing anti-trypanosomatids drugs were developed using the former approach, although the latter has gained much attention in the last twenty years under the rubric of \"rational drug design\". Until recently, one of the major bottlenecks in anti-trypanosomatid drug development has been our ability to identify good targets, since only a very small percentage of the total number of trypanosomatid genes were known. That has now changed forever, with the recent (July, 2005) publication of the \"Tritryp\" (Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania major) genome sequences.

Each species contains a number of gene families of varying size. Predicted functions have been ascribed to -40% of the protein-coding genes, but this has been confirmed experimentally for only -5% of the proteins. Most of the remaining genes encode conserved hypothetical proteins, of which slightly more than half are found only in trypanosomatids. Interestingly, -2-3% of the Tritryp proteins are related to those found in prokaryotes but not other eukaryotes. At least some of these appear to have arisen from horizontal gene transfer, and may represent excellent candidates for drug targets. The Tritryp genomes display a remarkable degree of synteny, with -75% of the genes in L. major having orthologues in both other species and >90% of these occurring in the same genomic context (see Table 1 ). The proteins within this Tritryp \"core\" proteome exhibit an average 57% identity between T. brucei and T. cruzi, and 44% identity between L. major and the two other trypanosomes, reflecting the expected phylogenetic relationships. 5'6 Interestingly, substantially fewer orthologues are shared only between L. major and T. brucei than between L. major and T. cruzi, perhaps reflecting the common intracellular environment of their mammalian stages. However, all three genomes contain a significant number of species-specific genes, which account for .-21% and 38% of the protein-coding genes in T. brucei and T. cruzi, respectively, but only -13% of the L. major genes. These species-speciflc genes (and pseudogenes) mostly encode large families of surface proteins, exemplified by the variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs) and Procyclic Acidic Repetitive Proteins (EP/PARP/procyclin) of T. brucei; the trans-sialidases, dispersed gene family protein 1 (DGF-1), mucins, and mucin-associated surface proteins (MASPs) of T. cruzi; and the amastins andpromastigote surface antigens (PSA-2) of L. major. In addition to these species-speciflc genes, all three species demonstrate differential paralogous gene expansion or contraction, with the ESAG4 adenylate/guanylate cyclases and leucine-rich repeat proteins being over-represented in T. brucei; GP63 surface proteases and recombination hot spot (RHS) proteins in T. cruzi; and mitochondrial carrier protein, ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporters, and Heat Shock Protein (HSP) 90 gene families in L. major.

Conversely, the paucity of Tritryp genes encoding transcriptional regulators is offset by an abundance of proteins with RNA binding motifs, 18 consistent with their reliance on post-transcriptional models of gene regulation. 19 DNA replication in trypanosomatids also appears to differ significandy from that in higher eukaryotes, with only one of the six subunits typically found in the eukaryotic replication origin complex being identified. 2 There are also substantial differences in the mitochondrial replication machinery, since the complexity of the kinetoplast DNA (the trypanosomatid equiva-9 20 lent of a mitochondrial genome) structure dictates an unusual replication mechanism.",

This database currently contains 153 5 targets and 2107 drugs/ ligands, including 19 entries listing potential anti-trypanosomatid use. The most simplistic approach for searching the Tritryp genomes for potential targets similar to these existing targets would be to carry out BLASTP or PsIBLAST searches of the Tritryp protein databases to identify parasite proteins with significant sequence similarity to those in the TTD. The resulting list of parasite proteins would need to be subsequently winnowed down by removing those that are too similar to the human orthologues and/or are similar to proteins involved in more than two pathways in humans, since drugs against these are likely to have deleterious effects on the human host. However, given what we know about the imprecise nature of the relationship between protein sequence and structure, it is likely that this method will have a significant false negative rate (i.e., it will miss many potentially useful targets because they won't have suf~cient sequence similarity). Statistical learning methods, such as support vector machines (SVM) and neural networks, have recently enjoyed considerable success for prediction of protein structure and may be useful for identifying targets missed by simple BLAST searching.

The identification of more than 8000 new protein-coding genes, many of which are shared between the Leishmania and Trypanosoma genera, vastly expands the potential drug targets available for investigation. In fact, the situation has gone from a relative dearth of useful targets to an embarrassment of riches, with far more potential targets available than can possibly be studied in detail. In this chapter, we have described several different computational approaches that should be useful in reducing this smorgasbord of genes to a manageable number of high-value targets, which will form the basis of detailed biological and pharmacological investigation. Of course, target identification is only the first stages in the lengthy and expensive process of drug development; with steps such as target validation, lead identification and optimization, as well as preclinical pharmacological screening, necessary before a potential drug can enter clinical trials. Nevertheless, these bioinformatic methods hold great promise in being able to identify targets (and potential lead compounds in some cases) which have a higher probability of successful drug development than traditional methods. While only time will reveal the validity of this promise, we hope that this advent of the post-genomics era for trypanosomatid biology heralds a renaissance in the discovery of much needed new drugs for the devastating diseases caused by these parasites.",
