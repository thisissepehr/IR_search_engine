The considerable heterogeneity in admission policies, study design, guidelines compliance [21] , and severity scoring in these studies probably accounts for the wide range of reported mortality rates and makes meaningful comparisons difficult. Most of these studies have used ICU admission rather than severity scores to indicate severe disease. Only three studies [12, 18, 21] defined censor points for death, which is important as in-hospital mortality increases following ICU discharge by between 15 and 27% [33] . Admission practices in different countries may also lead to large ranges in mortality. Take for instance one study of 395 patients admitted to a Spanish respiratory ICU in the 1990s the mortality rate was 5% but with rates of mechanical ventilation and septic shock of 9% and 2% respectively [14] , whereas in a UK study published in 1997 the mortality rate was 58%, with mechanical ventilation and septic shock rates of 96% and 16% respectively [11] . The mortality rates reported here are more in keeping with other recent, large cohorts. The CAPUCI group analysed 529 patients admitted to over 30 Spanish ICUs between 2000 and 2002 and found ICU mortality rates of 28% with associated APACHE II scores of 19 [21] . They included both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients. In the 459 immunocompetent individuals the rate of death at ICU discharge was slightly lower at 25%, a figure that is closer to the 19% seen in the GenOSept cohort, (in which immunocompromised patients were [3] . In the PORT study, 170 of 1,339 patients were admitted to the ICU with an in-hospital mortality rate of 23.3% [24] . The standard censor point for most interventional ICU studies is 28 days, although it is recognised that there is a significant attrition rate post ICU discharge. It is also well-recognised that in CAP patients there is an increased death rate in the months following discharge [34] , and in patients with sepsis there is significant excess mortality for at least five years [35] . In one study, the death rate of ICU patients between 28 days and 6 months was 9% in patients with sepsis, similar to the 8% seen in ICU patients without sepsis [36] and the 10% found in the present study. This compares to an increase in mortality from 18.2% at 30 days to 24.8% at 90 days in the subgroup of ICU patients in the PORT study [24] and an increase from 17.3% to 34.8% at 12 months in the GenIMS cohort of ICU patients [3] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 113, "end": 116, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 117, "end": 120, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 121, "end": 124, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 125, "end": 128, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 129, "end": 133, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 134, "end": 138, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 139, "end": 143, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 144, "end": 148, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 149, "end": 153, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 154, "end": 158, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 159, "end": 163, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 164, "end": 168, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 169, "end": 173, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 174, "end": 178, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 179, "end": 183, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 184, "end": 188, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 189, "end": 193, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 286, "end": 290, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 561, "end": 565, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 566, "end": 569, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 570, "end": 573, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 707, "end": 711, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1006, "end": 1010, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1160, "end": 1164, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1425, "end": 1429, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1705, "end": 1708, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1821, "end": 1825, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2106, "end": 2110, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2203, "end": 2207, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2370, "end": 2374, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2549, "end": 2553, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2640, "end": 2643, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Multivariate analysis"}, {"text": "Although the microbiological methodology was not standardised, our findings are consistent with previous studies of severe CAP. Notably, Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 28% of all cases and no aetiological agent was identified in over a third [37] .

Amongst the 333 patients with confirmed pneumococcal pneumonia in the present study, a total of 429 positive results were obtained. Of these 123 (29%) were positive urinary antigen tests and 42 (10%) were based on positive blood serology. Further evidence to support this apparent increase in detection rates is provided by a recent study that reported detection rates of 50% for Streptococcus pneumoniae, with 16% of cases being diagnosed using antigen testing [21] . In comparison, the BTS study from 1992 reported a rate of Streptococcus pneumoniae infection of 18%, with positive antigen testing in only 6% of patients [7, 21] . In hospitalised patients with CAP, as many as 18 to 29% may involve a viral infection, the virus being the only organism isolated in 10% [40] . Failure to respond to standard antimicrobial therapy means that more patients with viral pneumonia are likely to be admitted to ICU. Certainly patients with co-morbidities have a higher incidence of viral infection. In the present study viral infections were rarely identified. This raises the question as to whether a more aggressive search for viral pathogens should be conducted in all ventilated patients, coupled with more frequent and targeted use of antiviral therapy.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 250, "end": 254, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1208, "end": 1212, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1242, "end": 1246, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1711, "end": 1715, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1872, "end": 1875, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1876, "end": 1879, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2019, "end": 2023, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Multivariate analysis"}, {"text": "Multivariate analysis identified four variables (APACHE II score, haematocrit, mechanical ventilation and pH) that were independently associated with outcome at both 28 days and 6 months The need for mechanical ventilation was related to a worse outcome at both 28 days and 6 months, consistent with other data showing respiratory failure to be an independent predictor of mortality in many categories of critically ill patients [28, 29] . The persistence of this relationship for up to 6 months reflects the fact that many patients who have received ventilator support will continue to have significant neuromuscular weakness and be at risk for a prolonged period after discharge from the ICU [41] . It may be that over-aggressive use of intravenous fluids, reflected in a dilutional reduction in haematocrit worsens lung injury and thus prolongs the need for mechanical ventilation. Conservative fluid management has been associated with better outcomes, albeit in the later phases of critical illness [42] . A key element of early goal-directed therapy in patients with sepsis is blood transfusion to maintain the haematocrit, perhaps accounting for the positive association between better outcomes and a higher haematocrit in the present, and other studies [43] .
