Using nasal discharge as a parameter of a common cold does not pick up all cases, and in some children nasal discharge is not due to infection. It has been demonstrated that purulent discharge from the nose may be due solely to a viral infection and need not necessarily indicate secondary bacterial infe~tion.'~ The colds may have been due to a number of different viral infections, e.g. rhinovirus and coronavirus. Viruses can be cultured from about 70-80% of patients with a cold, and about 30% of these are rhinovirus infections.* Possibly, the different types of virus may cause different reactions in the Eustachian tube and a different degree of tuba1 dysfunction. Mucociliary function in the Eustachian tube is always abolished in SOM.6 The viruses presumably do not spread to the Conceivably, though, the children in the day institutions have a greater readiness for producing secretion, so that in them tuba1 dysfunction occurs more readily and is slower to return to normal. When ascertaining how often a common cold induces SOM, we found this to be most marked in group A, especially at the age of 1 and 2 years. In group B2 there were also many cases at 1 year of age, but this subgroup comprised only 9 children, so that the result is uncertain. All the youngest children of group A were from a day nursery and a young-children group in a kindergarten. Within group B2 quite a number of the colds induced SOM in the 5year-olds. Another finding of interest concerns the children who develop SOM without having a cold. As SOM usually does not appear until a few days after the cold, this may give part of the explanation. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the 3 groups in this phenomenon which comprised about 15%.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The cases of SOM which lasted for a long time, i.e. more than 3 months, do not seem to have been caused by lengthy colds.
