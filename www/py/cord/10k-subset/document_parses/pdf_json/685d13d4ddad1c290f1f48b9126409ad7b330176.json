Importantly, the understanding of P. ovale-nowadays regarded as the two distinct species P. ovale wallikeri and P. ovale curtisi-largely stems from case reports and case series lacking study designs providing high quality evidence. Consecutively, there is a lack of systematic evaluation of the clinical presentation, appropriate treatment and relapse characteristics of P. ovale malaria. The aim of this systematic review is to provide a systematic appraisal of the current evidence for severe manifestations, relapse characteristics and treatment options for human P. ovale malaria.",

For in vitro studies, only assays with interpretable results were considered. Severe P. ovale malaria was determined on the basis of the 2014 WHO criteria for severe falciparum malaria [14] and other serious or life threatening clinical conditions as defined by the authors. As parasite counts are generally lower in severe P. ovale than in severe P. falciparum malaria [7] no threshold was determined for parasitaemia. A relapse was defined as a reappearing P. ovale parasitaemia following an initially diagnosed and adequately treated P. ovale \"primary infection\" (regardless of 8-aminoquinoline application) and subsequent permanent residence in a nonendemic country. The term \"primary infection\" was used to describe the first reported P. ovale infection in the article, which was adequately treated (important for malaria infection studies, where patients were mostly not treated in case of self-limiting infection). The period between primary infection and relapse and two relapse events, respectively, was counted as time between the date of treatment and the first mentioned date of reappearance. In order not to confuse delayed primary attacks with relapses, articles where the primary infection was not explicitly stated to have been a P. ovale infection were excluded.",

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was reported in five patients and therefore was the most prevalent severe condition.

Following elaborations of underlying studies in the WHO guideline however rather break this down to experience [38] . In this systematic review, no high-quality studies supporting current treatment recommendations were identified. Not a single randomized controlled clinical trial on P. ovale malaria has been published in scientific literature. This finding is supported by a report by Visser et al. [37] . Although chloroquine has been tested in small prospective uncontrolled trials, one might question whether this small number of participants and a lack of control groups in all studies provide enough evidence for unequivocal treatment recommendations. Summing up all published reports and clinical experience, it becomes evident that anti-malarial drugs employed for P. falciparum are also effective for P. ovale.

Also the previously considered benign malaria species P. malariae, P. vivax and P. ovale were reported to cause severe disease and even death in a small minority of patients. To date little is known on the specific pathogenesis of severe diseases in these non-falciparum malarias. The results of this systematic review support this understanding. It is of interest that ARDS was the main feature of severe disease in P. ovale malaria as it was described in returning travellers with P. vivax malaria [40] . The potential coincidence that the two patients with a history of tuberculosis 10 years and more ago both died from ARDS raises the question whether a preexisting pulmonary condition may be a risk factor for respiratory complications of P. ovale infection [41, 42] . Anaemia was also reported as a feature of severe P. ovale malaria, however due to its multifactorial aetiology it is difficult to attribute this with confidence to P. ovale infection. Nevertheless it has been reported concordantly in paediatric patients with P. vivax infection in Asia [43] .",

The description of these histological structures resembles the findings of Krotoski described for Plasmodium cynomolgi bastianelli in Rhesus monkeys (average diameter 4.5 \u00b5m) and for P. vivax in chimpanzees (approximately 4-5 \u00b5m The patient who did not receive primaquine treatment for his 1st relapse developed a second one, however it was not clear from the article, which one of the two patients developed the described second relapse [50, 51] . However, this analogy does not constitute proof that these uninucleate structures truly represent hypnozoites or rather retarded forms. Furthermore it does not provide evidence for these structures to cause relapse events [48] . Based on this lack of firm experimental evidence and the scarcity of clinical reports a recent perspective article challenged the current concept of P. ovale relapse caused by liver hypnozoites proposing a gradual dormancy concept [52] .",
