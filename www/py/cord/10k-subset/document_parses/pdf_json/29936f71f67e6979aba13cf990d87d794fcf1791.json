Indeed, synthetic biology uses such models to design synthetic networks, prior to their construction in the cell, to perform specifi c tasks, or to change a biological process in a desired way.

To follow the protein dynamics of the positive feedback loop, a destabilized yellow variant of the enhanced green fl uorescent protein (d2EYFP) (Clontech), with a half-life of approximately 2 h, was expressed together with the tTA transactivator from the same mRNA, via an Intra Ribosomal Entry Sequence (IRES) in between of the transactivator tTA and the d2EYFP (Fig. 2 ) . In order to stably express in HEK293 cells the inducible feedback loop and to better characterize its dynamics overtime, we used a lentiviral vector ( 5, 6 ) , based on the multisite Gateway technology provided by Invitrogen. When deriving a model from experimental data, three major approaches can be used: white-box, black-box, and gray-box. In white-box modeling, the model and parameter values are entirely derived from fi rst principles, while in black-box, the model is completely derived from input-output data. The third alternative, the so-called gray-box approach ( 7 ) , combines the two above approaches. Specifi cally, fi rst principles are used to partially derive the model structure, while parameters in the model are estimated from experimental data. The approach described in this chapter, both for the yeast and the mammalian synthetic network, is a graybox one.

We show an example of such iteration, in the case of the yeast network. Once a model of a synthetic network has been derived, it is possible to refi ne it by means of several alternative strategies. The primary goal of model refi nement is the improvement of model predictions as regards the network dynamics, i.e., how gene and protein expression change in time following a perturbation; in order to accomplish this task, the experimenter may need to stimulate its synthetic network with highly dynamical signals. This is usually done to elicit nonlinear modes or other peculiar characteristics of the network under development. Most of the synthetic networks documented so far ( 12 ) use chemical compounds as inducers and thus the previous requirement often translates in the need to quickly change the concentration of these compounds in the media where cells are grown. On the contrary, effective strategies for data acquisition are needed to measure changes in the concentration of the species of interest in live cells. Here, we propose an integrated strategy intended to solve both of these issues at once via \"microfl uidics\" devices and timelapse fl uorescence microscopy. Microfl uidics involves the manipulation of very small fl uid volumes, enabling creation and control of nanoliter-volume reactors, thus mimicking cellular microenvironments. Microfl uidics devices can be conveniently used to fi nely control the concentration of compounds in the extracellular environment during time lapse microscopy experiments. Data acquired from long term stimulation of cells carrying fl uorescent tags and tracked by the microscopy imaging can be conveniently used to improve the quality of the mathematical model of the circuit of interest.

As mentioned above, in the fi rst set of experiments (Dataset 1) the cells were kept at 37\u00b0C, while, in the second round of experiments (Dataset 2), we used a lower temperature (32\u00b0C) to limit cell motility.

The dynamics of the \"switch off\" are faster if the temperature is higher, as the cells metabolism is faster ( 13 ) . In the model, we captured this behavior by changing the degradation rate of the reporter protein (parameter d 3 in Table 2 ). Another parameter we estimated, the maximal transcription rate of the CMV-TET promoter (Table 2 ) , was quite different form the reported value in literature. The physical meaning is that the strength of the positive-feedback loop is much stronger than previously estimated, at least in the cell-line we used in this experiment (HEK 293). The presence of the positive feedback loop is the key to understand the dynamics of the network, because it makes it harder for the d2EYFP to be down regulated by Doxycycline.

The setup of experiments for S. cerevisiae and mammalian cell lines is quite similar and differs only in the preparation of cells and temperature/ CO 2 conditioning settings.
