Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients with laboratory confirmed Penicilliummarneffei Results: 127 patients with P. marneffei infection were identified. All were HIV-infected; median CD4+ T-cell count was 24 cells/\u03bcl (IQR:12-48); 76% were men. Common clinical features were fever (92.9%), skin lesions (82.6%), hepatomegaly (61.4%), lymphadenopathy (40.2%), weight loss (59.1%) and cough (49.6%). Concurrent opportunistic infections were present in 22.0%; half of those had tuberculosis. Initial treatment regimens were: itraconazole or ketoconazole capsule (77.2%), amphotericin B (20.5%), and fluconazole (1.6%). In-hospital mortality was 12.6% and showed no significant difference in patients treated with itraconazole (or ketoconazole) and amphotericin B (p = 0.43). Dyspnea, ascites, and increased LDH level were independent predictors of mortality. No seasonality was observed. Conclusion: The clinical features, treatments and outcomes of HIV-associated P. marneffei infection in northern Vietnam are similar to those reported in other endemic regions. Dyspnea was an important predictor of mortality. More patients were treated with itraconazole than amphotericin B and no significant difference in treatment outcome was observed.

However as NHTD is a specialized tertiary hospital, and most (82%) of the cases were referred, and because other epidemiological data were lacking, it cannot be concluded that there is a difference in disease prevalence between northern and southern Vietnam. The clinical features of disseminated penicillosis are consistent with other studies including profound immunosuppression (median CD4+ T-cell count: 24 cells/\u03bcl) and high rate of co-infections with other opportunistic pathogens [2, 4, 6] . One third of the patients were already on ART for in average 10 days, this indicates that many patients had an ongoing P. marneffei infection that was not revealed before initiation of ART, but was probably unmasked by immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) after initiation of ART, this has earlier been reported in a few case studies [8, 9] . In our study the presence of dyspnea, ascites, and high LDH levels on admission independently predicted hospital mortality. Of the six patients that had dyspnea and died no one had tuberculosis or Pneumocystis jiroveci diagnosis, however two had septicemia. This may indicate that pulmonary involvement (i.e. P. marneffei pneumonia) drives disease severity or that the disease severity result in pulmonary lesions. This is consistent with a prior study showing that high respiratory rates and dyspnea among penicilliosis patients predicted poor hospital outcome [4] . Of the 11 patients with dyspnea 5 also had lung lesions, of these one was diagnosed with Pneumocystis jiroveci and non with tuberculosis. Lung involvement of P. marneffei has been shown in Taiwan where it was found to be the most common cause of cavities in the lungs of immunosuppressed HIV infected patients [10] . The majority of patients with dyspnea did not have lung lesions, hence the dyspnea might be due to the severe condition with multi-organ involvement and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It should be noted that there could be some under diagnosis of tuberculosis due to the poor sensitivity for sputum microcopy and culture in immunosuppressed individuals as well as for Pneumocystis jiroveci as microscopy of sputum, obtained by nebulizer or bronchoscopy, is not routinely performed.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 234, "end": 237, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 727, "end": 730, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 731, "end": 733, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 734, "end": 736, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1087, "end": 1090, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1091, "end": 1093, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1658, "end": 1661, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1974, "end": 1978, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Typical skin lesions were present in 80% of patients in this study. The pathogenesis and prognosis of skin involvement is poorly understood.

In the absence of skin lesions, the differential diagnoses for an AIDS-associated febrile illness with reticuloendothelial system involvement are broad and include: Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium Avium Complex, histoplasmosis and cryptococcosis among others [11] . This poses a major challenge in diagnosis and treatment, especially in areas with poor access to blood culture and other diagnostic laboratory. Penicilliosis should be considered in all severely immunosuppressed HIV patients with one or more of the common presentations, skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, ascites, jaundice and dyspnoea, who have been in P. marneffei endemic areas, and empirical antifungal treatment in very ill patients may be indicated.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 305, "end": 308, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 650, "end": 654, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In this study 22% of the patients had a concurrent OI; of whom half had tuberculosis.

In our study there was no significant difference between itraconazole and amphotericin B in treatment outcome. So far no randomized, prospective treatment trials have been conducted to compare the efficacy of different antifungal treatment regimens for penicilliosis.
