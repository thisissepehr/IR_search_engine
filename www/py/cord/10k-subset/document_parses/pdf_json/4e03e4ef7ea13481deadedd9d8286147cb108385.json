Nonetheless, they also left several gaps in knowledge: in example, the relationship between complications and survival had been analyzed at the 30 th postoperative day only [1] . While it is ascertained that patients with more depressed LVEF have worse late survival despite optimal surgical/medical management than patients with normal LV function, discussions have risen about reasonable and unreasonable employment of human and social resources for the treatment of the most severe patients. These discussions are both clinical and ethical, and they appear every time the limits of contemporary medical knowledge, convictions, healthcare system capacities are overwhelmed. The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is painfully illustrating the reality of such aspects to both the medical community and the public opinion. Similar to the sailors of the ancient world, we face in humility and grief the pillars of Hercules marking the limits of our possibilities, only to ask whether and how we will be capable to push them beyond.",

This is disturbing for healthcare providers who devoted major efforts in the rescue of cases with most severe postoperative course, which is intuitively considered as a success [3] .",

One must underline the importance of extreme vigilance over these patients in the early postoperative and promptness to escalate the level of care in response to a first major complication, in order to prevent additional complications to occur ('domino' effect). Beyond that, more granular strategies can hardly emerge from herein. In fact, the VASQIP database is a tremendous source of valuable information but the current paper lacks potentially significant data: in example, the surgical technique (beating-heart on-pump CABG has been proposed for very depressed LVEF or active ischemia); the number and outcomes of patients later receiving heart transplant or LVAD implantation (and their interaction with the complications burden); the demonstration and extent of myocardial viability. In this respect, it is surprising that late myocardial recovery has been scarcely investigated in prospective studies [4] , despite it constitutes one theoretical legitimation of the current indications to CABG. Other limitations are of minor impact, such as the 99% prevalence of male patients, one of the STICH sub-studies having demonstrated absence of gender-related differences in late outcome among these patients [5] .",
