New methods of CF applying different agents such as cephalin, bispecifi c nanoparticles, fuso-genic cell lines, or v-fusion are investigated [ 29 -32 ] . Combining different fusion methods and introducing additional modifi cations of conventional techniques have been studied to improve the fusion effi cacy, either by increasing the cellto-cell contact capability or permeabilization area. The selection of proper fusion method and protocol optimization depends on the cell type, cell number, culture conditions (monolayer vs. cell suspension), their sensitivity to unfavorable conditions, and equipment availability. The efficacy of polykaryons creation can be controlled by factors such as time and/or fusing agent concentration. Higher numbers of polykaryons can be also generated by repeating the fusion procedure [ 33 ] .

Monoclonal antibodies are used to treat a variety of diseases and conditions such as cancer, autoimmune disease, infl ammation, and transplant rejection. Creation of immortalized hybridomas is an essential part of monoclonal antibody production. Antibodies such as Muromonab-CD3 (anti-CD3) are directly produced by mouse hybridomas [ 49 ] . However, basiliximab (anti-CD25), which is a chimeric antibody, is primarily created by mouse hybridoma and further modifi ed by utilizing recombinant DNA technology to replace the mouse immunogenetic component of the antibody with human protein [ 50 ] . The concept of direct application of ex vivo CF in creation of cellular therapies was initiated by observations of opposite sex hematopoietic cell transplantation. The ability of transplanted stem cells to fuse spontaneously with defected cells and restore their function originated the research focused on creating cellular therapies. These experimental therapies are oriented towards approaches such as fusion of differentiated cells with stem cells or reprogramming of specialized cells to pluripotent state via CF of embryonic stem cells or embryonic germ cells.
