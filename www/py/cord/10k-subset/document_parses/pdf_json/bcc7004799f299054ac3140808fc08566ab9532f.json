Suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1) is a negative regulator of proinflammatory cytokine signaling. We have found that adenoviral gene transfer of SOCS-1 ameliorates smoke inhalation-induced lung injury in C57BL/6 mice. We also found that the release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was increased post smoke exposure, while oxidized ATP, an inhibitor of purinergic P2X7 receptor, suppressed smokeinduced NALP3 inflammasome assembly, caspase-1 activation, and K + efflux. Similar to oxidized ATP, high protein level of SOCS-1 dampened the formation of NALP3 inflammasome and the activation of caspase-1 and IL-1\u03b2 induced by smoke exposure in mouse alveolar macrophages. In conclusion, SOCS-1 relieves smoke inhalation-induced pulmonary inflammation and injury by inhibiting NALP3 inflammasome formation.",

Ninety percent of burn-related mortality can be partially attributed to smoke inhalation-associated acute lung injury (SI-ALI). Despite advances in care and rehabilitation of patients with burns, SI-ALI-related mortality remains substantial at 21.3% in 2015 [1] . Smoke inhalation is the leading cause of acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and serious respiratory failure. ALI/ARDS is also a significant clinical problem with no drug treatment currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Because ALI/ARDS patients entering the intensive care unit often have already developed clinical diseases, therapeutics targeting not only the initiation but also the propagation of ALI/ARDS is necessary. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms of smokeinduced lung injury can help the treatment of ALI/ARDS. Yet, despite decades of intense research, the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of smoke inhalation-induced ALI are poorly understood.",

Macrophages can be rapidly activated by burn injury to release proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1\u03b2), and may therefore play important roles in burn-induced ALI [8, 9] .

SOCS-1 is characterized by the presence of an N-terminal proline rich domain called the central Src homology 2 (SH2) domain and a C-terminal conserved motif named the SOCS box [13] . The SOCS box can couple with SH2 domain-binding proteins to activate ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and thus function as a negative regulator of cytokine signaling [14, 15] . SOCS-1 deletion causes fatal inflammation, which can be rescued by deletion of IFNG [16] . Previously, findings indicate that SOCS-1 is critical in macrophages for preventing uncontrolled inflammation [17] . In LPSinduced ALI, downregulation of SOCS-1 by alveolar macrophages-derived miR-155, which is a proinflammatory factor blinding to 3'-UTR of SOCS-1, remarkably exaggerates lung inflammation [18] . Increased expression of Ad-SOCS-1 has been shown to protect lung from hyperoxic injury by suppressing IL-1\u03b2 levels [19] . Ad-SOCS-1-infected murine exhibits a lower degree of lymphocytic inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis as well as a diminished mortality after bleomycin treatment [20] . However, the role of SOCS-1 in inflammation during smoke inhalation-induced ALI has not been revealed.",

NALP3 also participates in the pathogenesis of ALI [21, 22] . ATP, an NALP3 agonist, acts on P2X7 purinergic receptor (P2RX7) to alter the permeability of the cell membrane, which results in cytosolic K + efflux and the collapse of cation gradient [23] . A drop in cytosolic K + level is a common and sufficient trigger for NALP3 inflammasome assembly and caspase-1 activation [24] . In response to the rising outflow of K + , the assembly of ASC specks, which are large multimeric complexes predominantly composed of dimers and oligomers of ASC, is activated. This allows procaspase-1 to be recruited and starts the autocatalytic event that ultimately leads to the formation of active caspase-1 heterotetramers and the conversion of inactive cytosolic pro-IL-1\u03b2 to the functional form [24] [25] [26] [27] . Recent in vitro experiment using alveolar macrophages (AMs) indicates that ROS-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome plays an essential role in burn-induced ALI [7] . Other studies suggest that SOCS-1 may suppress the activity of NALP3, resulting in attenuated encephalomyelitis (EAE) pathogenicity [28] .",

Briefly, total RNA was extracted from C57BL/6 mouse liver tissue by Trizol RNA extraction kit (Invitrogen, US). RT-PCR (Thermo Fisher Scientific, US) was used to obtain mSOCS-1 cDNA by PrimeScript\u00aeRT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara, Japan). The mSOCS-1 cDNA was cloned into a multicloning site of pHMCMV10. The pAdHM4-SOCS-1 was constructed by ligation of I-CeuI/PI-SceI-digested pAdHM4 and I-CeuI/PI-SceI-digested pHMCMV10-mSOCS-1. To generate the virus, pAdHM4-SOCS-1 was digested with PacI and purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Linearized DNAs were transfected into HEK-293 cells with Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 (Invitrogen, US) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The viruses were amplified in HEK-293 cells.

            "text": "GFP exposed to smoke all died within 3 days and the lung tissue showed lung tissue damage and immune cells invasion. However, survival rates and these pathological changes were significantly ameliorated in Ad-SOCS-1 mice. Galam et al. show that SOCS-1 overexpression inhibits ASK-1 and suppresses IL-1\u03b2 levels to restore lung tissue in HALI [19] . Therefore, we speculate that ASK-1 may participate in inflammation of lung injury induced by smoke and interact with SOCS-1 in this process. 5 . Negative regulation of SOCS-1 on smoke-induced NALP3 inflammasome assembly, caspase-1 activation, and IL-1\u03b2 expression. Ad-GFP or Ad-SOCS-1-treated mice were exposed to smoke for 15 min and allowed to rest for 1 day. Isolated alveolar macrophages were analyzed for a NALP3 inflammasome assembly and b caspase-1 activity and IL-1\u03b2 secretion. NALP3 inflammasome is activated and the inflammatory cascade is triggered with subsequent fibrosis in crystalline silica-induced lung injury [38] . Bleomycininduced inflammation and fibrosis of ALI also require activation of NALP3 [39] . Using the mouse model of hemorrhagic shock (HS) in the lungs, HS activates lung endothelial NAD(P)H oxidase through high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) to induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS then promotes association of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) w i t h N A L P 3 a n d s u b s e q u e n t a c t i v a t i o n o f inflammasome and IL-1\u03b2 secretion [40] . NALP3 inflammasome formation and IL-1\u03b2 cleavage are induced by hyperoxia both in vivo and in vitro [32, 33, 41, 42] . In the hyperoxia-induced lung injury mice model, hyperoxia can induce ATP efflux. The elevated extracellular ATP interacts with P2X7 receptors, causing K + efflux and activation of NALP3 inflammasome [43] . Likewise, our results show that smoke-induced ATP promotes inflammasome formation and caspase-1 activation through stimulation of P2X7 receptorinduced K + efflux. Previous study investigating the effect of NALP3 on an inflammatory disease, EAE, demonstrates that IFNAR (the shared receptor for IFN\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) signaling in macrophages induces SOCS-1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation to decrease the production of mitochondrial ROS, resulting in inhibition of NALP3 inflammasome activity [28] . Our results indicate that SOCS-1 reduces NALP3 inflammasome formation through repression of the smoke-induced interaction between NALP3 and ASC, which thereby inhibits caspase-1 and IL-1\u03b2 activated by NALP3. Recent reports also indicate that Cobalt protoporphyrin induces COX-2 expression by activation of P2X7 receptors, ASK-1/MAP kinases, and STAT-1 degradation signaling pathways [44] . Therefore, there may be a relationship between ASK-1 and P2RX7 that leads to the formation of NALP3 in smoke-induced ALI, which we will further investigate in the future.",
