The introduction of free bile acids, cholic acid (CA) at concentrations over 2 mM and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) over 1 mM inhibited colloidal carbon pinocytosis. CA and CDCA at concentrations over 0.5 mM inhibited IgG-coated sheep red blood cell phagocytosis. With the application of conjugated bile acid and endotoxin at concentrations over 50 lag/ml, endocytic function was inhibited. With bile acids, a dose-dependent increase in the concentration of fl-glucuronidase occurred in the culture medium, and with endotoxin a timedependent increase in fl-glucuronidase was noted. Bile acids produced alterations in cell organelles before destruction of the cell membrane. The presence of endotoxin led to the appearance of large vacuoles in the cytoplasm. These observations suggest that bile acids and endotoxin inhibit Kupffer cells by different mechanisms. We tentatively conclude that bile acids rather than endotoxin influence Kupffer cells in vivo.",

However, the concentration of bile acids in bile canaliculi in obstructive jaundice has been measured to be 10-20mM (Klaasen 1971; Erlinger and Dhumeaux 1974) . Bile acids in the bile duct enter the sinusoid through leaky tight junctions and capillaries and bile acids in hepatocytes may leak into the sinusoid (Forker 1969; Sternlieb and Quintana 1985) .

One might be an alteration in the Fc receptor necessary to phagocyte IgGcoated SRBC (Munthe-Kaas 1976; Kaplan et al. 1975) . The present study demonstrated that IgGcoated SRBC phagocytosis was inhibited by bile acids even at a concentration of 0.5 mM. However, at this concentration colloidal carbon pinocytosis, which does not require special receptors, was not inhibited, suggesting that receptor alteration may not be a major influence. The detergent effect of bile acids has been considered to be an important cause of cellular dysfunction (Fedorowski et al. 1978; Kakis and Yousef 1978) . In our study, bile acids at concentrations over 0.5 mM CDCA or 0.5 mM CA interfered with the endocytic function of KCs. Although at these concentrations the membrane of KCs did not seem to be altered, the cellular organelles showed definite changes. Therefore, plasma membrane damage may not be the primary event. The pseudopodia and microvilli decreased in number and were shortened with increased concentrations of bile acids, hence, the microfilaments may also play a important role in KC function. In our study, the lysosomes decreased in number and p-glucuronidase activity in the medium increased as the concentration of bile acids increased. Dysfunction may follow the decrease in lysosomal fusion degradation, which is the last step of endocytosis after attachment to the cell membrane, internalization and intracellular transport (Praaning-van Dalen etal. 1982) , secondary to damage and decrease of lysosomes.",

It was reported that the concentration of endotoxin in vivo did not exceed 50 pg/ml (A1-Tuwaijri et al. 1981 ; Kuratsune et al. 1983 ). Therefore, the concentration of endotoxin which inhibited the endocytic function of KCs in this study was much higher than the concentration measured in vivo. The mechanism by which endotoxin caused damage to cultured KCs differed from that caused by primary bile acids. The KCs exposed to endotoxin had many cytoplasmic vacuoles considered to have originated from lysosomes and cell swelling in vivo (Frenzel et al. 1977; McCuskey et al. 1983 ) and in vitro (Maier and Ulevitch 1981 ; Morland and Kaplan 1977) . The present study confirmed that the same changes occurred with 100 pg/ml endotoxin. Therefore, KC dysfunction after the application of endotoxin was considered to be caused by excessive endocytosis (Mathison and Ulevitch 1979; Ruiter et al. 1981) .",

KCs treated with bile acids for 24 h produced similar changes (data not shown). It was therefore assumed that /~-glucuronidase secretion by KCs treated with bile acids was dose-dependent. When endotoxin carried to the liver is taken up and detoxified by KCs (Mathison and Ulevitch 1979; Praaning-Van Dalen et al. 1981) , fl-glucuronidase is secreted by these cells. In our study, the secretion of/~-glucuronidase did not increase with 100 pg/ml of endotoxin after less than 12 h incubation, but did increase with 10 ~tg/ml endotoxin after 24 h incubation. Therefore, the activation of KCs seemed to depend on the incubation time. There was also a difference between bile acids and endotoxin with regard to their effects on the secretion offl-glucuronidase from KCs.",
