Tt comprises thc ERI which is in continuity with the nuclear envelope, the Golgi apparatus, the endosomalllysosomal system, the secretory granules in cclls that possess the regulated secretory pathway, the plasma membrane, and various types of vesicular and/or tubular intermediates that mediate the dynamic connections between these niembranc compartmcnts (1) (2) (3) (4) . 'Thc ER is the entry site of the pathway and targeting to the ER is mediated by various typcs of EK targeting s e q u e n~c s (~-~) . Proteins destined for secretion and luminal proteins of intracellular compartments are cotranslationally translocated across the ER membrane: while integral membrane proteins are partially translocated across the membrane and are anchored in the lipid bilayer in various waysi5-6j. In the ER. proteins undergo various co-and post-translational modifications: including proteolytic cleavage, topogenesis. glycosylation, formation of disulfide bonds, polypeptide folding, assetnbly of homo-or hetero-oligonieric structures, lipidation and others\"). Only properly folded and assembled proteins can exit the ER (8) . Misfolded proteins are retained and degraded probably within the ER@'. The Golgi apparatus is a complex and dynamic organelle and plays a pivotal role in way up to the plasma membrane with the bulk membrane flow by default unless they are retained in specific compartments or sorted lo various branched Although several sorting signals (summarized in Table 1 ) and the main fcatures of the cxocytotic pathway have now been defined, inany fundamental questions remain to be answered and understanding of how soi-ting signals function is still lacking. Recent work done in this and other laboratories is now beginning to shed some light on several key grey areas. These include ER retention, ER-Golgi transport, Golgi retention and Golgi-cell surface transport. This review will deal mainly with these issues. Other important aspects of protein trafficking such as protein translocation across the ER, the biochemistry of vesicular transport and other aspects of protein transport have been reviewed extensively by other authors( 1-3S-6.14-16).",

One model, similar to that proposed for the ER localization of luminal proteins (see below), is that membrane proteins bearing this signal actually exit the ER and are then selectively retrieved from a post-ER compartment (e.g. the CGN) by binding to cytosolic. and/or membrane receptor (s), which triggers routing of the complex back to the ER. The potential components that interact with this signal have not yet been described. Identification, purification. characterization and molecular cloning of these putative interacting components will provide greater understanding of ER localization mediated by this type of signal. Several approaches may be employcd, and thc lirst will be to screen for mutants in yeast that are defective in ER localization mediated by this signal, followed by cloning and characterization of the mutant gencs. The yeast system can only be employed if the KKXX/KXKXX 01-related sequence could mediate ER localization in yeast, which remains to be established.

The details of the retrieval process, including the possibility of ligand-induced recycling of the receptor-ligand complex, is unknown. Recently. the transmernbrane topology of p23 has been established (our unpublished results). Several regions, including the carboxy-terminal21residue sequence of p23 are exposed to thc cytosol. These cytoplasmic regions. especially the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail, may potcritially interact with components of a morc elaborate recycling machinery upon binding the KDEL ligand (which occurs in the luininal domains). This interaction may lead to selective retrieval back to the ER. In support of this hypothesis, a mutation in thc yeast ERD2 gene that resulted in the deletion of the last 12 residues of the C-tcrminus led to a loss of the ERD2 gcne function (24),, establishing the importance ofthe C-terminal cytoplasmic tail in the function of this protein. By following the subcellular dynamics of p23 when the cells were subjected lo a low temperature treatment, we demonstrated that the mammalian homologue of the yeast ERD2 gene product could indeed cycle between the Golgi and the ER. as has been describcd for somc other proteins(10-11.20). The retrograde route from the Golgi back to the ER has been demonstrated and invcstigated by employing the fungal mctabolite, brefeldin A. which inhibits the antcrograde transport of the exocytolic pathway and causes extensive recycling of Golgi components back to the ER(\"l. Intercstingly, overexpression of the inammalian homologues of the yeast ERD2 gene in rnamrnalian cells caused brefeldin Alike effects. indicating that this protein may also be involved in regulating the balance between the retrograde and the anterograde traffic, and/or other important aspects of the exocytotic pathway('7).",

Upon warming up to 3 7 T , tubular extensions were observed to emanate from thc EKES, and this tubular network apparently connects the ERES to the perinuclear Golgi region. Within a short period of time. p23 could be chased exclusively into the perinuclear Golgi. There are several ways to account for the observation of the tubules and the tubular network emanating from the ERES. One hypothesis is that there may exist physical connections between the ERES and the entry sitcs of the Golgi and that vesicles derived from the ERES are transported along these physical connections to thc Golgi. We speculatc thal these physical connections could consist of several central 'highways' leading to thc Golgi and each ERES is connected to these central highways by its local 'driveway'. The tubular structures observed upon release from the low temperature block(\") could be the result of a continuous stream of transport vesicles moving along these 'driveways' and 'highways\".

A schematic depiction of this hypolhesis is presented in Fig 2. The concentration of p23. ts045 VSV G-protein and other proteins in the ERES at I 5OC could be the result of an accumulation of the budded vesicles around the ERES. which is most likely due to an inhibition of movement of the budded vesicles along the transport 'driveway' and 'highway'. The accumulation ofvcsicles in the ERES at 15 O C results in the formation of ultrastruclurally identifiable structures composed mainly of clustered vesicles and short tubules(37), the structure of which is morphologically similar to the transilional elements of the ER (33) (34) . These structures may also be The ERES might be equivalent to thc reccntly identified intermediate compartment involved in EK-Golgi transport.

A mutant form in which the cytoplasmic tail has been dclcted was delivcrcd to the cell surface, suggesting that the cytoplasmic tail of TGN38 is necessary for Golgi localization. When the cytoplasmic domain of TGN38 is transfered to a cell surface protein, the chimeric protein is indeed localized to the TGN. demonstrating that the cytoplasmic tail of TCN 38 is sufficient for TGN localization. Detailed dissection of this region revealed that a critical Tyr residue and some of its flanking residues are essential for the TCN localization (our unpublished observations). The nature of this cytoplasmic signal and thc mechanism governing TGN localization are currently being investigated.",

            "text": "Experiments so far have identified signals lhat mediate selective targeting to both the apical and basolateral surface, especially in polarized MDCK cells. 'The isolation of similar but distinct vesicles harboring either apical or basolateral cargo suggests strongly that selective transport to either surface is mediated by distinct types of vesicular carriers(74)). As has been previously proposed, transport to the plasma membrane could occur by default (17) This observation raised the intriguing question as to the whereabouts of the default pathway from the TGN lo the surface in polarized epithelial cells, such as MDCK cells. Our recent studies employing brefeldin A, in conjunction with other observations, indicate that there exists a default pathway from the TGN to both the apical and basolateral surfaces in MDCK cells (63) . Polarized cells could thus possess both signal-mediated and default pathways to either surface, creating an enigma of how the TGN sorts domain-specific proteins accurately while maintaining a default pathway to both surfaces. A highly speculative model is presented in Fig. 3 . We hypothesize that the TGN is struc-Apical surface Basolateral surface Fig. 3 . A hypothetical model for protein sorting in the TGN. We speculate that thc TGN is organized into two major sub-domains: the sorting (S) and default (D) domains. Proteins dcrived from the Colgi stack enter the TGN by fusion of the transport veiscles with the sorting ( S ) domain, where signal-containing proteins are actively packaged into vesicles destined for selected post-Golgi strnctures (e.g. the apical or hasolateral surface of polarized epithelial cells). Proteins with no sorting signals move readily from the S to the D domain and are then packaged into default vesicles that will fuse with any potential site of the plasma membrane. turally organized into two major domains: the S (sorting) and D (default) domains. The S domain is mainly involved in signal-mediated packaging of proteins to various types of transport vesicles destined for selected post-Golgi structures (e.g. the apical or basolateral domains of polarized cells); while the D domain is mainly involved in the formation of default transport vesicles which could ruse with any area of the plasma membrane (both the apical and hasolateral surfaces in polarized cells). The D domain is more distal than the S domain from the Golgi stack. Therefore, protcins derived from the Golgi stack encounter the S domain first and signalcontaining proteins are sorted inimcdiatcly to either the apical or the basolateral vesicles. Proteins containing no specific signals move readily from the S to the D domain by diffusion either in the lumen (for secretory proteins) or along the lipid bilayer (for membrane proteins), where they are packaged into vesicles for the default pathway to both cell surfaces. One important requirement for this model is the organization of the TGN into two structurally and functionally related but distinct domains. This complex nlemhrdne organization could readily be compared to the ER system, which consists of several domains, including the nuclear membrane. the rough and smooth ER, and possibly the ERES(2). This model would explain the experimental results accumulated so far. For example, the BFA effect on MDCK cells(62-63) could be resolved by proposing that BFA selectively inhibits the packaging of apical proteins into apical vesicles in the S domain. Unpackaged apical proteins lhen diffuse into the D domain whcre they arc incl~idcd into default vesicles that will fuse with both the apical and basolateral domains. The identified basolateral signals may mediate protein targeting into vesicles destined for the basolateral surface in the S domain, ensuring that the targeting is accurate and efficient even though there is a default pathway to both surfaces. If the signal was to be destroyed by mulagenesis, thc rnubnt proteins would no longer be sorted in the S domain and. therefore, evcntuallp end up in the D domain for the default transport to both surface^('^^^^). Alternatively. a protein may contain an apical signal whose function is masked by the presence of a dominant basolateral signal in the same protein, and such a protein is sorted to thc basolateral surface in the S domain. Mutagenesis of the dominating hasolateral signal will unmask the apical signal, which will then target the protein to the apical vesicles' 14.70) . Introducing a dominant basolateral signal could target an otherwise apical protcin to the basolat-era1 surface by selective packaging into basolateral vesicles in the S d~m a i n (~~~~~) ) .",

As mentioned above, there are two pathways for the targeting of protcins into the cndosomal/lysosornal system: direct targeting from the TGN or indirectly from the surface.
