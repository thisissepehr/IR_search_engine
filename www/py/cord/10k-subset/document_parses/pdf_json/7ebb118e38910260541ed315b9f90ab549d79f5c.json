Methods: We reviewed the literature on intensive care of pediatric intestinal transplantation as well as our own experience. This review is not aimed only at pediatric intensivists from ITx centers; these patients frequently require ICU care at other institutions. Results: Preoperative management focuses on optimization of organ function, minimizing ventilatorinduced lung injury, preventing excessive edema yet maintaining adequate organ perfusion, preventing and controlling sepsis and bleeding from varices at enterocutaneous interfaces, and optimizing nutritional support. The goal is to extend life in stable condition to the point of transplantation. Postoperative care focuses on optimizing perfusion of the mesenteric circulation by maintaining intravascular volume, minimizing hypercoagulability, and providing adequate oxygen delivery. Careful monitoring of the stoma and its output and correction of electrolyte imbalances that may require renal replacement therapy is critical, as are monitoring for and aggressively treating infections, which often present with only subtle clinical clues. Signs of intestinal rejection may be non-specific, and early differentiation from other causes of intestinal dysfunction is important. Understanding of the expanding armamentarium of immunosuppressive agents and their side-effects is required. Conclusions: As outcomes of ITx improve, transplant teams accept patients with higher preoperative morbidity and at higher risk for complications.

In selected experienced centers, ITx is now remarkably successful with up to 90% 3-year patient survival and 95% freedom from parenteral nutrition after isolated ITx [1, 2] . These results have led to increasing application of ITx as the treatment for intestinal failure (IF) when parenteral nutrition fails. Currently, approximately 175 ITx's are performed annually in the United States, with annual increases in volume [3] .

Threatened progression of early and/or mild parenteral nutritionassociated liver disease in patients with IF usually indicates transplantation of the intestine alone. The expectation is that postoperative withdrawal of parenteral feeding will arrest the progression of liver disease [12] . When severe fibrosis or cirrhosis accompanies IF, particularly with signs of portal hypertension, transplantation of both intestine and liver are required. Motility disorders may involve severe impairment of gastric emptying and may mandate multivisceral transplantation (to include the stomach). The consensus of the transplant community is that loss of half of the usual access sites, the internal jugular and subclavian veins, is sufficient to warrant referral [13] .

In general, patients with liver failure prior to transplant (combined liver/intestine or multivisceral recipients) have a more complex course than those patients receiving an intestinal graft alone, because impaired respiratory, renal, and cardiac function that are present before surgery do not correct immediately after organ replacement. Severe coagulopathy and portal hypertension as well as a more pronounced reperfusion injury make the transplant operation significantly more difficult, transfusion requirements higher, and may result in postoperative fluid overload. Severe infections and the need for reoperation for peritonitis in the first week post-transplant are also more common in patients with multivisceral transplants. Vital organ function typically continues to deteriorate in these patients in the early post-operative period as a result of the extreme pathophysiological stresses associated with transplant surgery. As a result, duration of mechanical ventilation and time interval to successful enteral feeding are longer in these patients (Table 3) . Poor vital organ function can be surmounted with appropriate critical care support if good graft function is obtained early and maintained thereafter.

Hemoglobin oxygen saturation[95% and hematocrit between 27 and 30% provide the optimal balance between oxygen carrying capacity and viscosity that, when high, reduces cardiac output and microcirculation. Tissue perfusion is also preserved by maintenance of a relatively hypocoagulable state. An INR of 2-3 and platelet count as low as 40 9 10 -6 /L are not usually associated with spontaneous bleeding, and plasma and platelet transfusions should generally not be given if postoperative intra-abdominal bleeding is absent. Hemodynamic stability is critical for graft viability and function. Cardiac output should be normal to high, based primarily on adequate volume status (assessed by central venous pressure in conjunction with clinical examination) rather than inotropic support, as early postoperative hypotension is usually due to hypovolemia secondary to intraoperative sub-optimal fluid administration, shifts of fluid out of the intravascular compartment, and high peritoneal fluid losses. In light of protein loss from peritoneal fluid, albumin is usually given. Ideally, maintaining adequate hematocrit, oxygenation and preload will lead to adequate tissue perfusion. However, if vasopressor and/or inotropic support are necessary, agents with a predominance of alpha receptor activity, i.e., norepinephrine, should be avoided, since these vasoconstricting agents tend to produce acceptable blood pressure at the expense of graft perfusion.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Cardiovascular"}, {"text": "After the acute postoperative phase, either hypotension or hypertension may be encountered.

Dose requirements may be altered by absorption and intestinal graft function. Beta-blockers are commonly employed in patients with extended liver failure who have left ventricular hypertrophy.

After transplant, generous fluid administration required to maintain graft capillary blood flow risks pulmonary edema, leading to intrapulmonary shunts, especially with pre-existing lung disease. Decreased chest wall and abdominal wall compliance secondary to edema, large graft size, ascites, and pleural effusions may further compromise pulmonary function. High inspired oxygen concentrations and distending airway pressures needed to maintain desired hemoglobin oxygen saturation greater than 95% may lead to further pulmonary injury. In patients with severe lung disease, permissive hypercarbia may minimize such injury, with target tidal volumes of 6-8 cc/kg body weight and plateau pressures \\30 cm H 2 O, as per the ARDSnet protocol [24] . High frequency oscillatory ventilation is sometimes required to achieve adequate oxygenation while maintaining low intra-alveolar pressures. Patients with a multivisceral transplant are at an increased risk for transient diaphragmatic dysfunction that can be assessed with ultrasonography or fluoroscopy. This may prolong the mechanical ventilatory course but is almost always reversible with conservative management.

Patients with multivisceral transplants usually remain intubated for several days, particularly when large graft size mandates delayed abdominal closure (Table 3) , however, the priority must be early extubation to reduce the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Increases in stoma output caused by infection with Rotavirus and Norovirus typically occur more suddenly and in higher volumes [over 100 mL/kg/day] than are typical of acute rejection, and may result in acute dehydration and hypovolemic shock; resistance to antiperistaltic agents is typical [41] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 747, "end": 751, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "High stomal output"}, {"text": "The nephrotoxic effects of tacrolimus and other agents may lead to impaired concentrating ability; polyuria may continue until hypotension supervenes. Because of concurrent medication-induced reductions in baseline GFR, blood urea nitrogen levels may become very high. Absence of anticipated oliguria during periods of high stoma output may delay recognition of dehydration by both family and health care providers. Treatment consists of prompt restoration of intravascular volume, immediate intestinal biopsy to identify the cause of the diarrhea, and adjustments in immunosuppression based on diagnosis; treatment of rejection (increased immunosuppression) may be detrimental if the correct diagnosis is viral enteropathy.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "High stomal output"}, {"text": "Numerous regimens have been employed to induce the high degree of immunosuppression required to prevent initial rejection of the allograft [42, 43] . Standard agents include methylprednisolone in combination with tacrolimus (Prograf \u00d2 ). Methylprednisolone is administered in doses as high as 50 mg/kg in total during the first postoperative week, subsequently converted to low-dose [0.1-0.2 mL/kg/day] oral prednisone. Tacrolimus is administered either through the gastrointestinal tract or intravenously to achieve a whole blood trough level as high as 25 ng/mL during the first post-operative month and tapered progressively thereafter. In recent years, this regimen is often supplanted with the interleukin-2 receptor antagonists basiliximab (Simulect \u00d2 ) and daclizumab (Zenapax \u00d2 ) as well as anti-lymphocyte preparations such as Thymoglobulin \u00d2 and alemtuzumab (Campath \u00d2 ).
