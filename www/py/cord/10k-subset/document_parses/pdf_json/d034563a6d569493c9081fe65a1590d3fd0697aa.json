Figure 2 shows the overplay of baroreceptor regulation: blood pressure and heart rate rose and fell in parallel Depressed myocardial contractility resulted in a low cardiac output of 2.5 1/min at high normal filling pressures. Myocardial damage due to catecholamine excess was likely to be responsible for later ventricular tachycardia degenerating into fibrillation. Repeated electrical defibrillation was necessary. Typically severe hypertension had occurred minutes before the serious arrhythmias. No consistent evidence for myocardial infarction was found. ECG showed intermittend loss of Rwaves anteroseptally and incomplete right bundle branch block. Van Vliet has examined 26 fatal cases of pheochromocytoma [13] ; 15 showed histological evidence of \"active catecholamine myocarditis\": focal degeneration and necrosis of myocardial cells, inflammatory cells, diffuse edema and left ventricular hypertrophy. Atrial and ventricular arrhythmias had been common in these patients.",

In our patient it developed on the second day of hospitalization and was accompanied by total loss of muscle tone in the extremities. EEG, CT and normal cerebrospinal fluid examinations were compatible with diffuse encephalopathy. Hepatic failure may have contributed to the cerebral dysfunction. But the coma persisted while ammonia levels fell close to the normal range. The full mental and neurological recovery from coma and loss of muscle tone in this patient rules out major ischemic or hemorrhagic vascular events. Disseminated intravascular coagulation with typical multiple cerebral hemorrhages had been found by Hill et al. in 1 patient who died from a pheochromocytoma [8] . In addition a thrombotic occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery had been found. A further case of pheochromocytoma had also shown transient unconsciousness [9] . CT scan had revealed bilateral cerebellar infarction. Cerebral artery spasm, embolism, intravascular thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation have been discussed as possible pathogenetic mechanisms for cerebral dysfunction in pheochromocytoma. Hypertensive encephalopathy was probably not the cause of coma in our patient. In one case of MEN II coma had been more likely due to hypoglycemia from insulinoma than the result of catecholamine excess [14] .",
