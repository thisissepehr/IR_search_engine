NET formation has been reported to be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, there are no reports dealing with serial changes of NET formation in tracheal aspirate of ARDS patients. Case presentation: We report three cases of ARDS. Case 1 is a 69-year-old man with necrotizing fasciitis of the buttocks, case 2 is a 49-year-old woman with extensive burns (80% of total body surface), and case 3 is a 73-yearold woman with severe bacterial pneumonia. We found abundant expression of citrullinated histone H3 (Cit-H3) and the formation of NETs at the onset of ARDS in all cases. The amounts of Cit-H3 and NETs decreased with the amelioration of respiratory failure in cases 1 and 2. In case 2, the amounts of Cit-H3 and NETs increased with aggravation of infection and respiratory status. In case 3, the abundant expression of Cit-H3 and NETs persisted; the patient did not recover from ARDS and eventually died. Cit-H3 and NETs were found in tracheal aspirates even if the patients had no direct injury to the lung as in cases 1 and 2. Conclusions: In these three cases, the formation of NETs was observed in tracheal aspirate of patients with ARDS by either direct or indirect insults to the lung. The amount of NET formation changed dynamically over the clinical course of each patient.",

The main components of NETs are deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), histones, and intracellular antibacterial proteins such as neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase [1] . Citrullination of histone H3 leads to the formation of NETs by decondensing chromatin, which is a marker of active NET formation [2] . NETs rapidly trap and kill pathogens by antibacterial proteins and histone toxicity [1] . In addition, NETs lead to the recruitment of neutrophils and induce clotting within blood vessels [3] . These mechanisms prevent bacteria from disseminating hematogenously to other tissues, but they can also cause endothelial and tissue damage through inflammation and ischemia [4] . The formation of NETs is stimulated by contact with pathogens such as bacteria or fungi and by various factors such as inflammatory stimuli (damage-associated molecular patterns, cytokines, or activated platelets) or chemical compounds [5] . The clearance of NETs is processed by DNase and macrophages [6] .",

Injury is initiated by either direct or indirect insults to the alveolar structure of the lung. It is characterized pathologically by diffuse alveolar damage, fibrin deposition, and excessive infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into the alveolar space. Large amounts of toxic mediators (neutrophil elastase, myeloperoxidase, histones, and reactive oxygen species) are also detected in the alveolar spaces [7] . Because the components of intraalveolar fluid from ARDS patients are similar to the component elements of NETs, the association between ARDS and NETs has been focused on.",

These reports assessed the amount of NETs by quantifying DNA and histones in alveolar lavage fluid, lung tissue, or plasma by cross-sectional analysis compared to controls or healthy people. The serial change of NET formation in ARDS patients is unclear. In addition, sampling by alveolar lavage or lung biopsy is an invasive medical procedure that is difficult to perform in patients with severe respiratory failure. Thus, it is necessary to perform a less invasive method to identify NETs in ARDS patients. Tracheal aspirate may be a surrogate sample for assessing NET formation in ARDS patients. However, there have been no reports, to our knowledge, of NET formation being observed in tracheal aspirates of ARDS patients. Here, we report three cases of ARDS patients with morphological assessment of NET formation in tracheal aspirates and their clinical courses.",

We previously reported that the length of NETs in tracheal aspirates initially increased and then shortened during acute respiratory infection, and this correlated with the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as interleukin-8 or CXC ligand-2) in the blood [13] . The association between interleukin-8 and NETs was also reported in ventilator-associated pneumonia [9] . The amount of NET expression in bronchial aspirates might be associated with the increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines even in ARDS patients. It was also reported that the formation of suicidal NETs induced by various stimuli occurred within 3-4 h in vitro [16] . However, the timing of NET formation triggered by stimuli in vivo is unclear. As we reported previously, the maximum amount of NET release was observed on the day following the development of bacterial pneumonia, whereas the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the blood was most abundant on the day of onset [13] . The release of NETs via pro-inflammatory stimuli might be delayed in critical situations in humans when compared with that in vitro. Further study is needed to confirm these suppositions.",

These reports all suggested an association between the quantity of NETs and the severity of ARDS: in other words, \"the more NETs, the more severe ARDS.\" In our patients, the progression or regression of NETs in tracheal aspirates paralleled the patients' respiratory status, and the persistent release of NETs resulted in a poor outcome in case 3. Observed changes of NET release in aspirate can be a marker of ARDS severity and predictor of the clinical course. They also imply that controlling NET formation might contribute to the control of ARDS. Previous reports suggested that not only excess expression of NET release but also reduced clearance of NETs by macrophages and DNase were observed in ARDS [11, 17] . Controlling NET formation by inhibiting inflammatory stimuli or enhancing the clearance function might be new therapy for ARDS. Further accumulation of basic and clinical observations is warranted to elucidate this point.",

We also identified NETs in the bloodstream in intubated patients, and NETs were more frequently detected in \"the presence of bacteria in tracheal aspirates\" group [18] . These findings suggested that the presence of bacteria in the respiratory tract may be associated with NET formation in the tracheal aspirates and blood. Other reports suggested that infection was a major factor inducing NET formation but that infection was not necessary to trigger their release. NET release is induced by various stimuli: microorganisms, damage-associated molecular patterns, pathogenassociated molecular patterns, cytokines, and chemokines [19] . NET release occurred in our patients with not only direct lung injury caused by microbial pneumonia but also indirect injury due to severe insults of other tissues. This finding suggests that NETs in tracheal aspirates could be formed by stimuli other than direct bacterial effects and may help in understanding the pathology of ARDS in critical illness.",
