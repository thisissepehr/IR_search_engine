Despite many hypotheses about the increased risk of complications and comorbidities in the underweight and obese BMI groups, our study does not validate the hypothesis that these cohorts of patients have increased severe sepsis mortality [7] . Rather, our results support those of prior studies of critically ill patients demonstrating no significant difference in mortality between different obesity strata [6, 7, 29] .

An examination of the baseline clinical characteristics across BMI groups reveals several plausible explanations for why, despite fulfilling criteria for severe sepsis, obese patients show a trend toward, and morbidly obese patients experience significantly lower mortality than normal BMI patients. Specifically, morbidly obese patients present in a less critically ill state than the other groups based on clinically significant differences in: age (younger,) hemodynamic status (higher minimum MAP,) laboratory values (higher CrCl despite higher serum creatinine levels,) lower mean calculated ED APACHE II scores, and lower MICU admission rate. Furthermore, along with the obese group, morbidly obese patients present much more frequently with severe sepsis due to skin or soft tissue infections than do those with lower BMIs.

First, due to the retrospective design of our study, 10 % of patients who had severe sepsis during the study period were excluded due to missing BMI data. In addition, our retrospective design is potentially prone to selection and ascertainment bias. However, excluded patients were comparable to the included cohort in terms of age and severity of illness (Appendix 2-3). Second, the use of admission height and weight for BMI calculations is another potential limitation. Patient weight at presentation to the ED, or upon arrival to a hospital floor, will vary the degree of dehydration and the volume of fluid resuscitation delivered in the ED. This is likely to generate a non-differential bias given that processes of care in the ED did not differ by BMI, and weights were recorded prior to knowledge of the primary outcome. Further, BMI may not be an accurate predictor of risks associated with obesity, and a component of BMI may reflect volume overload not obesity in patients with congestive heart failure and other diseases. More nuanced analyses of the relationship between obesity and mortality may be obtained if a measure of functional status is included in the analysis, [33] or if the waist circumference is measured in addition to BMI [34] . We did not collect information on recent weight loss, and a recent weight loss of 10 % in a morbidly obese or underweight patient may compromise health and confer increased risk. Further, we did not collect data on nutrition consumed during hospitalization, and variations in the percent of daily requirements actually received during critical illness may have implications about outcomes. In addition, despite having a final cohort of 1,191 patients, the number of patients in the underweight group (102 patients), and combined obese and morbidly obese group (308 patients), may have been underpowered to find differences between them and other groups that were actually present thus producing a Type II error. Using a database of severe sepsis patients with a wide range of disease severity concentrated the primary outcome in a smaller cohort of patients, and this may have biased toward no difference in mortality being found between BMI categories.
