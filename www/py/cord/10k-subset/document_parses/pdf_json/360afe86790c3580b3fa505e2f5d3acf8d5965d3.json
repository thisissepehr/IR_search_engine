Interestingly, ER-to-Golgi blockade or ER stress induces alternative GRASPmediated, Golgi-bypassing unconventional trafficking of wild-type CFTR and the disease-causing \u0394F508-CFTR, which has folding and trafficking defects. Here, we show that Sec16A, the key regulator of conventional ER-to-Golgi transport, plays a critical role in the ER exit of protein cargos during unconventional secretion. In an initial gene silencing screen, Sec16A knockdown abolished the unconventional secretion of wild-type and \u0394F508-CFTR induced by ER-to-Golgi blockade, whereas the knockdown of other COPII-related components did not. Notably, during unconventional secretion, Sec16A was redistributed to cell periphery and associated with GRASP55 in mammalian cells. Molecular and morphological analyses revealed that IRE1\u03b1-mediated signaling is an upstream regulator of Sec16A during ER-to-Golgi blockade or ER stress associated unconventional secretion. These findings highlight a novel function of Sec16A as an essential mediator of ER stress-associated unconventional secretion.",

During protein overload in the ER lumen, the number of ERES increases together with the Sec16A levels in response to the increased cargo load 17 .

The blockade of ER-to-Golgi transport, either direct via the inhibition of COPII-mediated vesicular transport (e.g., transfection with the dominant-negative form of Sar1), or indirect via the inhibition of COPI-mediated transport (e.g., transfection with the dominant-negative form of Arf1), triggers the activation of ER stress 18 and evokes the unconventional secretion of core-glycosylated CFTR via the GRASP-dependent mechanism in mammalian cells 7 .",

Wild-type CFTR undergoes Golgi-mediated complex glycosylation, and the complex-glycosylated CFTR (Fig. 1 , band C) was expressed at the plasma membrane in a surface biotinylation assay (Fig. 1a) . As reported previously 7 , the induction of ER-to-Golgi blockade by the dominant-negative Arf1-Q71L mutant induced the cell-surface expression of ER core-glycosylated wild-type CFTR and also the folding-deficient \u0394 F508-CFTR via unconventional protein secretion ( Fig. 1a-d, lane 3) . To exclude the possibility that these results were caused by a nonspecific inhibition of membrane protein internalization, we repeated the experiments with the inhibitor of dynamins (dynasore) or the dominant-negative dynamin mutant (dynamin2-K44A) that had been shown to inhibit the internalization of plasma membrane proteins, such as transferrin receptor and CFTR 19, 20 . As shown in Figure S1 , although these treatments increased the cell-surface expression of transferrin receptor and complex-glycosylated wild-type CFTR by 40-80% ( Figure S1a ,b), dynasore and dynamin2-K44A neither affected Arf1-Q71Lmediated cell-surface expression of core-glycosylated CFTR nor induced cell-surface expression of \u0394 F508-CFTR ( Figure S1b-d) .",

HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing wild-type (WT) (a,b) or \u0394 F508 CFTR (c,d), and a surface biotinylation assay was performed 24 h after transfection. Some cells were cotransfected with the Arf1-Q71L plasmid to induce ER-to-Golgi blockade. The cells were pretreated with scrambled or Sec16A-specific siRNAs (100 nM) 24 h before plasmid transfection.

Representative surface biotinylation assays are shown (a,c), and the results of multiple experiments (n = 4) are summarized (b,d). Sec16A knockdown abolished both the conventional cell-surface trafficking of the Golgi complex-glycosylated WT-CFTR (band C) and the unconventional cell-surface trafficking of the ER coreglycosylated WT, as well as \u0394 F508 CFTRs (band B) induced by Arf1-Q71L.

Knockdown of Sec16B and core COPII components (Sec23, Sec24, Sec13, and Sec31) did not affect the unconventional cell-surface transport of \u0394 F508-CFTR.

CFTR at the cell surface was immunostained with anti-HA antibodies before membrane permeabilization (green), and then the total CFTR was stained with anti-R4 CFTR antibodies after permeabilization (red). Some cells coexpressed Myc-Sar1-T39N to induce unconventional surface expression of \u0394 F508-CFTR (c,d). The expression of the Sar1-T39N mutant was confirmed by anti-Myc staining.

Interestingly, Arf1-Q71L altered the intracellular localization of Sec16A. In control cells, Sec16A displayed typical ERES localization, in which Sec16A puncta were mostly concentrated in the juxtanuclear area ( Fig. 3a and HA-negative cells in Fig. 3c ; arrowheads). However, when the ER-to-Golgi transport was blocked by Arf1-Q71L, Sec16A dispersed into more peripheral regions and the Sec16A puncta appeared in >80% of the cytoplasmic area ( Fig. 3b-d, arrows) . These results are comparable to a recent finding that ER relocalization of GRASP is a requisite for unconventional secretion of CFTR 21 .",

Subsequent immunofluorescence colocalization analyses assessing both the percentage of overlapping area and the pixel colocalization correlation between Sec16A and ER markers revealed that the relocalized Sec16A puncta were highly colocalized with the ER-marker proteins, suggesting that Sec16A relocalized to the peripheral ER area (Fig. 5) . The peripheral localization of Sec16A increased Manders' Colocalization Coefficient (MCC) due to an increment in the co-incident coefficient between the fractions of Sec16A and ER marker proteins (Fig. 5c,g) .",

In addition, Sec16A puncta located in the cell periphery were completely devoid of GRASP55 (Fig. 6a ). Stimuli that induce unconventional secretion, such as ER stress and ER-to-Golgi blockade, significantly redistributed and colocalized the Sec16A and GRASP55. Treatment with thapsigargin, which induces ER stress by depleting Ca 2+ stores in the ER lumen, and coexpression with Arf1-Q71L or Sar1-T39N, which induces ER-to-Golgi blockade, redistributed GRASP55 from the juxtanuclear region to entire cellular area, significantly increasing the overall colocalization of GRASP55 with Sec16A puncta, especially in the peripheral regions ( Fig. 6b -e).

Again, a high level of GRASP55 expression or ER-to-Golgi blockade by Sar1-T39N relocalized the Sec16A puncta into > 80% of the whole cellular area in HeLa cells, whereas only ~20% of the cellular area was Sec16A-positive in control cells. In contrast, neither GRASP55 expression nor ER-to-Golgi blockade by Arf1 and Sar1 mutants significantly altered the Sec31A distribution. Morphometric quantification indicated that Sec31A remained in ~15% of the whole cellular area of cells with GRASP55 overexpression or Sar1-T39N (Fig. 7) . Interestingly, the cellular distribution of Sec31A seemed to be contracted by the ER-to-Golgi blockade, especially by Sar1-T39N, although the change was not statistically significant ( Fig. 7c -e). Coimmunostaining with \u03b3 -tubulin revealed that Sec31A became highly concentrated at the minus ends of the microtubules, known as the centrosome or the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC; Figure S7 ). In addition, the distribution of Sec24, another core component of COPII, was also not affected by ER-to-Golgi blockade ( Figure S8 ).

Therefore, we next investigated the role of IRE1 in Sec16A-mediated unconventional secretion. As shown in Fig. 8a ,b, the depletion of IRE1\u03b1 by siRNA strongly inhibited Arf1-Q71L-induced surface expression of \u0394 F508-CFTR in HEK293 cells, but supplementation with exogenous Sec16A rescued the effect of mutant Arf1 that induced the cell-surface expression of \u0394 F508-CFTR. Furthermore, consistent with the mutant Arf1 results, GRASP55-induced \u0394 F508-CFTR rescue was inhibited by IRE1 silencing and recovered by Sec16A replenishment (Fig. 8c,d) . Immunocytochemistry results further supported the notion that IRE1 is an upstream regulator of Sec16A expression and localization during unconventional secretion. IRE1\u03b1 depletion reduced the overall Sec16A expression levels in HeLa cells, and the increased Sec16A-positive area resulting from Arf1-Q71L or GRASP55 overexpression was diminished from 91% to 19% (Fig. 9) .

In addition to this well-defined conventional trafficking pathway, recent evidence suggests that many cytosolic, nuclear, secretory, and membrane proteins reach the cell surface by unconventional secretion pathways that bypass the Golgi 24 . In general, unconventional secretion events are not constitutive, but are instead stress induced. Cellular stress signals such as inflammation, starvation, mechanical stress during development, and ER stress can induce the unconventional secretion of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins 7, 25, 26 . However, the mechanisms and molecular components of the unconventional pathways, and particularly, how the secretory cargos leave the ER are still not fully understood. Here, we provide evidence that Sec16A is involved in the ER exit of the cargos during ER stress-associated unconventional secretion in mammalian cells.",

Sec16A in mammals is a large hydrophilic protein that is tightly associated with ERES and makes an indispensable contribution to the organization of ERES 27 and COPII-mediated ER export 28, 29 . The inhibition of COPII function by Sar1-T39N induces, rather than inhibits, unconventional CFTR secretion (Fig. 2c) . In contrast to that of Sar1 (Fig. 2c) and core COPII components ( Fig. 1e and Figure S2 ), the silencing of Sec16A inhibited the unconventional secretion of CFTR induced by ER-to-Golgi blockade or GRASP55 overexpression (Figs 1, 2 and Figures S2 and S4) . These results indicate that Sec16A is a global organizer or regulator of ER export with a role that is not restricted to the conventional COPII-mediated transport pathway.",

Subsequently, Sec16 analogs were found in other species and shown to be involved in the COPII-mediated ER exit of cargo proteins in those organisms. However, the specific and precise role of Sec16 in COPII-mediated transport is still not fully established. For example, Stephens et al. suggested that Sec16 is a central organizer of COPII vesicles that defines ERES localization and recruits core COPII components in a stoichiometric fashion 27, 30 . In contrast, Glick et al. proposed that Sec16A regulates COPII turnover and consequently influences the stability of ERES instead of organizing COPII vesicle formation 31 . Although there is some debate about whether Sec16 recruits COPII to ERES or the other way around 31 , it is generally agreed that Sec16 associates with core COPII components and is required for export-site assembly and function 32 . Our results indicate that Sec16 is also required for the COPII-independent ER exit of secretory cargos. Considering the scaffolding role of Sec16, it will be intriguing to identify the binding partners of Sec16A during ER stress or ER-to-Golgi blockade. Such investigations should aid our understanding of the molecular components and the big picture of ERES for unconventional protein secretion.",

            "text": "A notable finding of the present study is the relocalization of Sec16A. In Drosophila larval muscle cells, it has been reported that parts of dGRASP colocalize with Sec16 and participate in the ER exit of the integrin subunit \u03b1 PS2 33 . However, it is unclear as to whether dGRASP and Sec16 mediate unconventional secretion of \u03b1 PS2 in Drosophila. Furthermore, dGRASP and Sec16 are enriched around the nucleus in Drosophila muscle cells during \u03b1 PS2 secretion 33 . In contrast, GRASP55 and Sec16A relocalize to the cell periphery and mediate unconventional secretion of CFTR upon ER stress or ER-to-Golgi blockade in mammalian cells (Figs 3-6 and 9) . Notably, the core COPII component Sec31 did not relocalize under those conditions (Fig. 7) . Instead of dispersing Sec31, Sar1-T39N seemed to cause Sec31 to move to a more central distribution relative to the MTOC ( Figure S7 ), suggesting the possibility that there is a signal that induces the relocalization of Sec31 into the minus end of microtubules during strong ER-to-Golgi blockade. The ER-Golgi interface and ERES are concentrated in the juxtanuclear region adjacent to the MTOC. The COPII vesicles that depart ERES initially travel towards the minus ends of the microtubules, which transport cargo proteins to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, and eventually to the Golgi 32 . After being processed in the Golgi, the secretory cargos leave the trans-Golgi network and travel towards the plus ends of the microtubules via vesicular trafficking to reach the cell surface. The peripheral movement of Sec16 puncta raises the possibility that ER stress signals separate Sec16A from the core COPII components by transporting Sec16A towards the plus ends of the microtubules. The unconventional secretion of CFTR induced by ER stress and ER-to-Golgi blockade is sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and nocodazole 7 , indicating that it requires vesicular trafficking via microtubules. The peripheral localization of Sec16A and ERES for unconventional secretion might facilitate the direct trafficking of secretory vesicles to the cell surface via short-distance, plus-end trafficking on microtubules that bypasses the Golgi.",

An alternative explanation of this finding would be that Arf1-Q71L or other potentially cytotoxic treatments may nonspecifically increase cell-surface expression of membrane proteins by inhibiting internalization of surface proteins rather than activation of a secretion event. As shown in Figure S1 , the inhibition of membrane-protein internalization by dynasore and dynamin2-K44A did not evoke the cell-surface expression of core-glycosylated CFTR, suggesting that inhibition of protein internalization cannot account for the cell-surface expression of core-glycosylated CFTR during ER stress and ER-to-Golgi blockade. An interesting finding to note is that the inhibition of cell surface-protein internalization did not significantly affect CFTR transported unconventionally to the cell surface by Arf1-Q71L ( Figure S1b-d) , while it did increase the cell-surface expression of conventionally transported membrane proteins by 40-80% ( Figure S1a,b) . These results suggest that Arf1-Q71L inhibited the internalization of surface proteins. Considering that the folding-deficient membrane proteins that are transported to the cell surface remain under the control of peripheral protein quality control 34 , the inhibition of internalization would be an additional benefit that increases their retention time at the plasma membrane, although the inhibition of internalization alone is not capable of inducing the cell-surface expression.",

To maintain homeostasis in the ER lumen, the ER responds to an excess of unfolded proteins and relieves ER stress by triggering UPR signaling pathways 38 . Generally, UPRs reduce the protein load in the ER by decreasing the transcription and translation of secretory proteins, and by directing misfolded proteins into the ER-associated degradation pathway 39 . In addition, UPRs may activate the secretion of misfolded proteins via the unconventional route to relieve ER burden 7 . IRE1, one of the three major branches of UPR signaling 16 , was shown to be responsible for the generation of new ERES and the upregulation of Sec16A during chronic overload of a secretory cargo 17 . IRE1 was also shown previously to mediate ER stress-induced unconventional secretion of CFTR 7 . Our current findings suggest that the IRE1-mediated UPR is a major upstream signal that regulates the generation and anchoring of Sec16A at the ERES involved in ER stress-induced and GRASP overexpression-mediated unconventional secretion (Fig. 8) .",

It is possible, however, that a simple reduction in Sec16A levels by IRE1 knockdown, rather than by true inhibition of Sec16A redistribution, would lower the Sec16A in immunofluorescence to subthreshold levels more profoundly in the peripheral regions than in the perinuclear region. Although we analyzed the immunofluorescence images with an increased laser gain to minimize the problem (Fig. 9) , our results cannot completely rule out this possibility. In any case, profound reductions in peripheral Sec16A levels are associated with decreases in unconventional secretion of CFTR. Considering that peripheral redistribution of GRASP55 is critical for the unconventional secretion of CFTR 21 , and that GRASP55 associates with Sec16A during ER-to-Golgi blockade (Fig. 6) , peripherally localized Sec16A would play an important role in the ER exit of cargos during ER-to-Golgi blockade. Therefore, accumulated evidence suggests that 1) GRASP is redistributed from the Golgi to the ER during ER stress and recognizes some cargos subjected for unconventional secretion, particularly membrane proteins such as CFTR that have a PDZ-binding motif at their C-terminus, and 2) GRASP associates with the Sec16A-containing protein complex, which delivers the cargos to the vesicles that depart from the ER membrane during unconventional secretion.",

Recently, Joo et al. reported that ATG1/ULK-mediated phosphorylation at the Ser846 residue of Sec16A is essential for the COPII-mediated ER-to-Golgi trafficking under basal physiologic conditions 41 . Considering the finding that ATG1 is also involved in the ER stress-induced, unconventional trafficking of CFTR 7 , it will be an interesting task to investigate whether phosphorylation(s) at specific Sec16A loci is required for unconventional secretion. Increasing evidence indicates that autophagy components are involved in various kinds of unconventional trafficking. For instance, coronaviruses use nonlipidated, ATG8/LC3-positive vesicles for replication, which emerge from the ER by a COPII-independent mechanism 42 . However, this pathway is not dependent on ATG7 42 , whereas the ER stress-induced, unconventional trafficking of CFTR is dependent on both ATG7 and ATG8 7 . Therefore, it appears that diverse cargos, from viral particles to mammalian membrane proteins, employ several combinations of autophagy components for their travel to the cell surface after ER exit.",

Amplification was performed under the following cycling conditions: 95 \u00b0C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, and 60 \u00b0C for 40 s. Analyses were performed in triplicate for each cDNA. The relative mRNA expression levels were calculated using the comparative threshold cycle (C t ) method with GAPDH as a control, as follows: \u0394 C t = C t (GAPDH) \u2212 C t (target gene). The fold-change in gene expression normalized to GAPDH and relative to the control sample was calculated as 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394Ct .",
