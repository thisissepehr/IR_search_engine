Using epidemiological analyses and economic modeling, we propose that the best use of these and similar funds would be to serve as global insurance against the continued threat of emerging infectious diseases. An effective strategy would involve the initial investment in strengthening mobile and adaptable capacity to deal with the threat and reality of disease emergence, coupled with repeated investment to maintain what is effectively a 'national guard' for pandemic prevention and response. This investment would create a capital stock that could also provide access to safe treatment during and between crises in developing countries, lowering risk to developed countries.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The 2013-2015 West African Ebola virus disease outbreak (hereinafter termed ''W. African Ebola outbreak'') lasted more than 1 year and was longer and larger (65 times the next largest historical outbreak) than any prior outbreak, with 27,678 reported cases in 10 countries and 11,276 reported deaths as of July 15, 2015 (World Health Organization 2015a, b; Table 1 ). Most previous outbreaks have been localized to a single country, and only 7 have caused more than 100 known cases prior to 2013, with the largest of these affecting 425 people (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2014; Table 1 ). The unprecedented scale of the 2013-2015 outbreak highlights a critical weakness in our global battle against the threat of pandemics-the lack of a well-funded, long-term strategy to pre-empt pandemic emergence. Pandemics originate from sporadic, but frequent emerging disease events that are caused largely by socioeconomic and environmental changes (Morse et al. 2012) . As prior pandemics have occurred, societal response has included initiatives designed specifically to thwart their origin and spread, e.g., broadening of the International Health Regulations (IHR) following the SARS outbreak (Orellana 2005; Heymann et al. 2015) . These initiatives are often coupled with surges of funding for basic and applied research to reduce future threats. However, these are often subject to waning public interest in the inter-pandemic intervals between perceived threats. For example, in the USA, the 2001 anthrax attacks led to a surge of funding to counter potential bioterrorism agents ('select agents') much of which supported strategies of value to other pandemic pathogens (Morens et al. 2004; Khan 2011) . The emergence of H5N1 avian flu and H1N1 pandemic flu each led to funding for the development and purchase of medical countermeasures (vaccines and drugs) and for basic science and capacity building in countries of high prevalence (Collin et al. 2009; Walley and Davidson 2010) . Following the largest ever Ebola outbreak in 2013-2015, the US President requested $6.18 billion and Congress allocated emergency funding of $5.4 Billion for control and prevention programs (The White House Office of the Press Secretary 2014; Mikulski 2015) . The World Health Organization (WHO) announced a $100 million emergency fund to avoid impacts of future emerging diseases (Reuters 2015) . Here we use epidemiological and economic analyses to examine whether this could be considered another step in a boom-bust cycle of pandemic threat and response, or the beginning of a new strategy to pre-empt the repeated emergence of pathogens with pandemic potential. We then examine how these funds could be spent to best reduce the opportunity for future global health emergencies of the same scale as the 2013-2015 West African Ebola outbreak.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 956, "end": 975, "text": "(Morse et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1203, "end": 1218, "text": "(Orellana 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1219, "end": 1239, "text": "Heymann et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1683, "end": 1703, "text": "(Morens et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1704, "end": 1714, "text": "Khan 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1948, "end": 1968, "text": "(Collin et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1969, "end": 1994, "text": "Walley and Davidson 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2240, "end": 2254, "text": "Mikulski 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2378, "end": 2392, "text": "(Reuters 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 357, "end": 364, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 594, "end": 601, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Our analysis consists of two components: an epidemiological analysis of factors that may have led to the unprecedented scale of the West African Ebola virus disease outbreak, and an economic analysis that uses this information to examine optimal self-insurance-cum-protection (SICP) funding strategies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "METHODS"}, {"text": "We conducted a basic epidemiological analysis to test two hypotheses on why the 2013-2015 W.

We describe the general modeling framework here, with further mathematical details and some analytical results in an ''Appendix''. We examine the economic tradeoffs associated with investments in preventing a disease outbreak and apply the model to the Ebola case. Unlike prior analyses that distinguish between ex ante disease prevention and ex post disease control, e.g. (Berry et al. 2015) , we recognize that investments in preventing an outbreak (e.g., healthcare capacity) may also be useful in controlling an outbreak should it occur. Investments like these that reduce both the likelihood of a bad state of nature (self-protection) and the severity of the bad state (self-insurance) have been termed self-insurance-cumprotection (SICP; Lee 1998) . Our analysis examines the economically optimal investment strategy in SICP to address future major disease outbreaks and assess whether there are likely to be significant benefits to such investments in the case of Ebola-like outbreaks. To do this, we examine the dynamics and economic impacts of the West African Ebola outbreak, and use this to analyze the economics of its prevention. Our model makes the preliminary assumption that urban areas are currently free from an Ebola outbreak, although the occasional random infection may generate a risk of a major outbreak in one or more areas that could then spread quickly. The expected economic costs of this outbreak are referred to as economic damages and denoted JX(N(t)), which consist of both human health expenditures and lost productivity and commerce. Damages are decreasing in a stock of SICP capital N t \u00f0 \u00de; i.e., JX N (N(t)) < 0 (Subscripts denote derivatives with respect to the indicated variable). The capital stock represents the capacity to reduce the chances of a major outbreak (selfprotection), and to also react rapidly to reduce the economic costs of any outbreak that does arise (self-insurance).

Models of the 2013-2015 epi-demic's early growth dynamics (Kiskowski 2014 ) suggest that we should expect no strong linear association between population density and final outbreak size. These models also lend weight to the notion that the proportion of outbreaks which are large may increase in the future. Community and household structure modulates the effect of population density on disease transmission (Kiskowski 2014) . The stochastic nature of epidemics sees many (around 40%) initial outbreaks burn out with fewer than 150 cases. With small community mixing sizes (e.g., C = 5 outside-of-household contacts per individual), the distribution of epidemic size is skewed toward smaller numbers of cases. As community mixing size increases (representing more urbanized environments), the distribution of epidemic size becomes bimodal, with almost all epidemics which reach the survival threshold seeing over 1000 cases. This implies that while the 2013-2015 outbreak was not significantly different from past outbreaks, the increased interconnectedness of the area which it occurred in led to a larger overall outbreak. This is of course only one driver of the increased risk of an outbreak, and we can also consider land use change and climate change to be possible drivers. This is consistent with the 2013-2015 outbreak, where a major city (Conakry) was affected early in the outbreak [by the end of May 2014 when there were still less than 300 cases (World Health Organization 2014b)], whereas previous Ebola outbreaks were successfully contained in less densely populated areas.

However, the portion of funding allocated to SICP remains unclear and may not adequately reflect the benefits of SICP. By contrast, the pandemic fund proposed by WHO is correctly positioned for SICP but woefully inadequate. We find that a standing capital prevention stock of $970 million could provide expected savings of $10.3 billion in reduced costs from avoiding expected future emerging disease impacts. Maintaining this stock at a steady state, however, would require annual investments of $48.5 million. That represents a significant amount of funding by donors, and one that would be politically challenging. We argue that this would be best structured as a pre-outbreak investment in strengthening existing SICP networks, e.g., through the WHO Global Outbreak Alert Fig. 3 . Time paths of key variables in the baseline scenario. The panels depict the time (t, shown on the horizontal axis) paths of the following variables in the cost-minimizing outcome prior to a future Ebola-like outbreak: a SICP capital stock, N, b investments, n, and c the hazard rate, w (solid), and background hazard rate, b (dashed). We assume initial capital stocks are negligible and that the initial background hazard rate is 2.6% and growing. Discontinuities at time t = 0 stem from a large initial investment in N (since N(0) = 0), which immediately increases N and decreases the hazard rate from the initial background level of b(0) = 0.026. After this initial investment, smaller investments in SICP are required to increase the capital stock as the background risk level increases to its steadystate value, after which investments only occur to offset the effects of depreciation. The investments mitigate the increased background hazard as the hazard rate remains much smaller than, and increase less quickly than, the background rate. and Response Network (GOARN). This could involve strengthening GOARN to explicitly fund a reserve of mobile staff, equipment and laboratory capacity coupled with annual investments to maintain and expand this reserve over time. Staff and equipment could be deployed to leverage existing capacity in developing nations and emerging infectious disease hotspots (Allen et al. 2017 ).

Previous articles have likened pandemic prevention to military activities (Time Inc 2015) , and there has been a growing interest in, and funding to support global health threats as concomitant threats to security (Global Health Security Agenda 2018). While there are clear moral and ethical differences between wars and pandemics, this metaphor has economic cogency-for military and pandemic threats, investing in internationally-based rapidly deployable human resources coupled with strengthening of in-country infrastructure and capacity to curtail new events is economically optimal (Gostin and Friedman 2015) . Defense departments use these approaches to counter global security threats. They create an overseas surge capacity (a 'standing army') and build alliances with partner nations, which include providing additional capacity to those partners. They also develop tactics to avoid redundancy in peace time. For EIDs, this could consist of trained responders based in regions prone to emerging diseases, with reservists stationed in donor countries. These international allies would be deployed first through networks like the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN)-with significantly improved capacity. In the West African Ebola outbreak, international aid funds were used to supply equipment and staff to enhance clinical and diagnostic capacity, to purchase personal protective equipment, increase biosecurity, and more rapidly develop and test vaccines and therapeutic agents (e.g., Butler 2014). These measures appear to have been ultimately successful. But without continued funding, capacity building investments depreciate over time, making them temporary in nature. In addition, if these resources were already deployed overseas before the outbreak, they may have been distributed faster. This leads to a health economics dilemma: the strategy of responding to risks with a sudden increase in the flow of prevention spending-treating the control of the outbreak risk as a temporary flow that we can wait out-may be inadequate. A global pandemic fund, structured to produce a networked 'standing army' with international reservists to combat EIDs and to support ongoing costs of maintenance avoids this problem. This approach seems to reflect the goals of WHO GOARN (World Health Organization 2018). A straightforward solution to the pandemic threat may be a better-funded GOARN with a line item commitment for donor funding that cannot be significantly degraded between outbreaks or in global recessions, as seems to have occurred prior to the recent Ebola outbreak (Gostin and Friedman 2015; Heymann et al. 2015) . This could be enhanced with a formal link to in-country programs that use development aid to build capacity to counter the pandemic threat (Gostin and Friedman 2015) . Examples recently proposed include the FAO-OIE-WHO ''One Health'' approach to building biosecurity around livestock farms in countries where prior influenza outbreaks have originated (World Bank 2008) , and the USAID ''Emerging Pandemic Threats'' program that targets novel and known emerging zoonoses in EID hotspots (Morse et al. 2012) . While an international network of reservist experts would be needed to support this approach, a focus on building a standing army of local first-responders in at risk nations built around EID hotspots would logically provide the best allocation of resources. It also suggests that continued funding for global health security in countries at high risk of pandemic emergence could be a critical step to optimizing prevention and response to their threat (Global Health Security Agenda 2018).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 172, "end": 187, "text": "(Time Inc 2015)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 685, "end": 711, "text": "(Gostin and Friedman 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2695, "end": 2721, "text": "(Gostin and Friedman 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2722, "end": 2742, "text": "Heymann et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2884, "end": 2910, "text": "(Gostin and Friedman 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 3096, "end": 3113, "text": "(World Bank 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 3231, "end": 3250, "text": "(Morse et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Fig. 2."}, {"text": "The proposed levels of investment in our analysis should be taken as a lower bound.

This would act as an additional benefit of capital, so that the optimal amount of investment in prevention rises until the total marginal benefit is equal to the marginal cost of funds. This could be a result of extending the focus from global health security to individual health security (Heymann et al. 2015) .

(6) represents a linear control problem. The optimal choice of n depends on the sign of its marginal value:where n * is the singular value of n (i.e., an interior, unconstrained solution). This condition says no investments should occur when the marginal benefit of SICP investments (q 1 ) is less than the marginal cost of investment (unity), and investments should occur at a maximum level when the marginal benefit of SICP investments exceeds the marginal cost of investment. The singular solution should occur when the marginal benefits and costs of investment are equated. The remaining necessary conditions for an optimum are given by the following adjoint conditionsand also the state equations. Together, conditions (A1)-(A4) and the state Eqs. (1), (2) and (5) determine costminimizing behavior through time.Note that condition (A3) has the solutionFrom (A5), -q 2 is the present value of expected costs, at time t, conditional on an outbreak having not yet occurred. Define Z = (JX(N) + q 2 ). This expression represents the difference between the certain costs of an outbreak (JX) and the expected costs continuing along the pre-outbreak prevention path (q 2 ). Hence, Z is the expected increase in costs from transitioning from the pre-outbreak to post-outbreak state at time t. Alternatively, Z is the expected cost savings (i.e., a net benefit) from continuing along the pre-outbreak path as opposed to transitioning to the post-outbreak state. The term Z must be positive (Z > 0); otherwise the post-outbreak costs would be less than preventing an outbreak and it would be optimal to transition sooner. In what follows we treat Z as a state variable that changes over time according toWe proceed by examining the singular solution. In this case, (A1) yieldsTime differentiating this condition yields _ q 1 \u00bc 0.
