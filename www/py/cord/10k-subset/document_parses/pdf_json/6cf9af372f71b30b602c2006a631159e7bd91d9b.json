Escherichia coli expresses a variety of adhesins (e.g., pili, fimbriae) that may enable it to more strongly adhere to the housefly (Kalita et al. 2014 ). It has been demonstrated that pili on the surface of E. coli use a roll and stick adhesion mechanism and are, not only resistant to shear force, but activated by it (Thomas et al. 2004) . The bacterium may also stick more strongly to the pulvillus, which is the sticky substance released by the glandular hairs of filth flies (Graczyk et al. 2001) . In a study by Tan et al. (1997) , it was shown that increased viscosity can make it more difficult for the house fly to remove materials adhering to the legs. It is possible that the E. coli create a more viscous solution that adheres to the fly bristles and hairs more strongly than other bacteria. The strain used in the study presented here (E. coli ATCC 25922) encodes a limited number of adhesins including papG (DR76_1632), fimH (DR76_2431), sfaD (K758_20486), and csgA (DR76_3880) (Minogue et al. 2014) . Future studies will be needed to define the roles for E. coli ATCC 25922-encoded adhesins, as well as additional adhesins encoded by other pathogenic E. coli strains Flies were exposed to E. coli or P. aeruginosa for 5 min and then not allowed to clean or allowed to clean for 5 or 10 min. Bacterial reduction was then calculated by dividing the average bacterial measure for 5 min or 10 min by the average bacterial measure for no cleaning and multiplying by 100. The three species of flies tested were selected for their size variation. It was found that the flies did not pick up significantly different amounts of bacteria/gram weight. After allowing time for cleaning, they also were able to remove similar amounts of bacteria, as the 5 and 10 min cleaning times were not significantly different for the three fly species. In a study by De Jes us et al. (2004) , the number of E. coli that M. domestica could pick up from food and carry on their body were quantified to be up to 5.5 log 10 CFU/fly. Our study indicates that the number of E. coli cells adhering to M. domestica flies was highly variable ($5.5 log 10 -8 log 10 CFU/fly). However, our results show that flies pick up similar amounts of bacteria when fly size is taken into account (Table 3) . Another interesting finding was that D. virilis picked up significantly more P. aeruginosa than E. coli. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a known pathogen of D. virilis that relies upon the twitching pathway to be pathogenic (D'Argenio et al. 2001) . Twitching is a locomotor mechanism which relies upon type IV pili (Semmler et al. 1999) . It is possible that the type IV pili could be used for attachment to the fly. It is not known why it would be higher in one species of fly, but there were differences in M. domestica's ability to remove E. coli as well. We may find bacterial adaptations for fly species that are yet unknown. Lewis and Hughes (1957) reported two primary mechanisms that flies used to remove fine particles: \"walking\" them off of the tarsal spines and forming clumps of particulate that could be knocked off. Szebenyi (1969) characterized cleaning behavior in D. melanogaster as sweeping and rubbing that moved particles off the body, while Holloway (1976) observed that hover flies contaminated with pollen used tapping, combing, and eating to remove the pollen. In this study, flies that were exposed to bacterial contamination increased their cleaning behaviors significantly. They also used the combing or rubbing behavior to fling bacteria in aggregates off their bodies (Table 3) . This action could be contributing to bacterial transmission, but it was also noted that they significantly increased the movement of the legs to the mouth. This would suggest that the flies could be eating the contaminating bacteria, although it was not quantified in this study. A recent publication by Nayduch and Burrus (2017) described the interaction of house flies and bacteria. Larval house flies eat bacteria as a nutritional requirement. This could be an important means of reducing bacterial loads on fly surfaces.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 84, "end": 111, "text": "(Greenberg 1971, Levine and", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 112, "end": 124, "text": "Levine 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 183, "end": 202, "text": "(Guber et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 336, "end": 355, "text": "(Kalita et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 524, "end": 544, "text": "(Thomas et al. 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 685, "end": 706, "text": "(Graczyk et al. 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 723, "end": 740, "text": "Tan et al.

(2008) found a significant reduction in bacteria from the wings of M. domestica when inoculated with Vibrio cholerae. Flight was also found to significantly reduce the amount of bacteria on flies; however, the proportion of bacteria retained on individual flies varied greatly. This study also reported that M. domestica was capable of removing 86% of both E. coli and P. aeruginosa, although the removal was only significant for P. aeruginosa due to the high level of variability for E. coli. The importance of cleaning seems supported by the fact that flies removed 86% of both E.coli and P. aeruginosa within 10 min of cleaning. However, flies in our study failed to remove all of the plate-acquired bacteria, which may shed insights into the ability of M. domestica to mechanically spread infectious agents for up to 8 d (Graczyk et al. 1999 , Nayduch et al. 2002 . Moreover, ingested bacteria are greatly reduced in the gut of the fly after 3-4 d but still can remain viable and be transferred via defecation (Kobayashi et al. 1999 , Sasaki et al. 2000 .
