The specific aim of this study was to understand the epidemiological characteristics of mild and severe enterovirus cases through integrated surveillance data. Methods: All enterovirus cases in Taiwan over almost ten years from three main databases, including national notifiable diseases surveillance, sentinel physician surveillance and laboratory surveillance programs from July 1, 1999 to December 31, 2008 were analyzed. The Pearson's correlation coefficient was applied for measuring the consistency of the trends in the cases between different surveillance systems. Cross correlation analysis in a time series model was applied for examining the capability to predict severe enterovirus infections. Poisson temporal, spatial and space-time scan statistics were used for identifying the most likely clusters of severe enterovirus outbreaks. The directional distribution method with two standard deviations of ellipse was applied to measure the size and the movement of the epidemic. Results: The secular trend showed that the number of severe EV cases peaked in 2008, and the number of mild EV cases was significantly correlated with that of severe ones occurring in the same week [r = 0.553, p < 0.01]. These severe EV cases showed significantly higher association with the weekly positive isolation rates of EV-71 than the mild cases [severe: 0.498, p < 0.01 vs. mild: 0.278, p < 0.01]. In a time series model, the increase of mild EV cases was the significant predictor for the occurrence of severe EV cases. The directional distribution showed that both the mild and severe EV cases spread extensively during the peak.

Before the laboratory results came back, the media called it a mystery disease, which made numerous Asian parents worried. In fact, severe epidemics of enterovirus have occurred frequently in Asia, including Malaysia [2] , Singapore [3] , Taiwan [4, 5] and China [6] . The clinical severity varied from asymptomatic to mild symptoms [hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) and herpangina], severe pulmonary edema, hemorrhage and encephalitis [7] . The EV-71 infections involved 6-29% asymptomatic infection, 13-32% non-specific viral syndrome, and 37%-40% HFMD/ herpangina symptoms [8] . Among the non-polio enterovirus serotypes, EV-71, which has caused severe clinical illness and many fatal cases [9] , and particularly a high risk of poor prognosis for children under one year of age [7] , has become one of the most important public health concerns since the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the \"global polio eradication initiative\" program in 1988 [10] . However, children with an asymptomatic and mild infection of EV-71 still can carry the virus to transmit to others [11] . During 1998~2005, 37.98% (588/1,584) of severe EV cases in Taiwan had only encephalitis complications, and 22.8% (353/1,584) had encephalitis with pulmonary edema or hemorrhage [7] . In other words, whether increasing numbers of mild EV cases would provide a possible sentinel signal of the early stage of an epidemic is worth investigating, particularly as a vaccine and more effective drugs for EV-71 have not been available [12, 13] .

A lag effect between mild and severe EV cases was taken into account to find out whether mild EV cases occurred earlier or later than severe EV cases, in order to determine whether mild cases might serve as early warning signals for severe cases. In addition, we applied cross-correlation analysis in a time series model to see whether there was any conditional correlation among the severe and mild EV cases and four types of EV isolation. An ARMA model (Autoregressive moving average model) was fit using the SAS Release 9.2 software (Cary, NC). The selection of the autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) was based on the minimum information criterion (MINIC) method [17] . Because the mild and severe EV cases were from different surveillance systems, the age definition of the EV cases we used was different.

The cumulative incidence of the pediatric severe EV cases was calculated with the corresponding mid-year population from July 1999 to 2008.

After identifying the space-time clusters of the severe EV cases, the corresponding data of the mild EV cases from sentinel physician surveillance were further analyzed for consistent temporally increasing trends or even earlier increasing trends.
