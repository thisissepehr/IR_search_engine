LRV generates a short transcript, corresponding to the 5' end of the positive-sense RNA (320 nt), via a cleavage event mediated by the viral capsid protein on the full-length positive sense RNA transcript. To address the possibility that the RNA cleavage represents a regulatory mechanism for maintaining persistent infection, the interactions between Leishmania cytoplasmic proteins and in vitro synthesized viral transcripts were studied. In gel mobility shift experiments, three specific RNA/protein complexes were formed between cellular proteins and the cleaved viral transcript, and three major proteins were labeled by UV cross-linking. No protein binding activity was observed for either the short (320 nt) or full-length RNA transcripts. However, the two cleavage reaction products were able to form stable RNA/RNA complexes. We present a model in which the virus is targeting its own transcript for cleavage to promote binding of host factors to cryptic domains inaccessible in the full-length transcript.",

PCR analysis further suggests that viral transcripts do not possess the 39-nt mini-exon sequence, the trans-splicing leader required for translation in trypanosomatids (3, 12) . Absence of the mini-exon sequence is supported by the results of cDNA tailing experiments (unpublished data). These observations suggest that LRV1 has evolved a capindependent translation strategy, presumably using cisacting elements present in the 5' end to provide an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) function. The predicted 5' end structure of LRV positive-sense RNA resembles those of polioviruses and other picornaviruses known to initiate translation by internal ribosome entry (23, 14) .

Mobility shift and cross-Unking experiments were performed to examine the binding characteristics of the viral 5' end in three different transcripts (full-length, and the two products produced by cleavage) for host proteins.

The resulting supernatant (S10 fraction) was either stored at -80'C or centrifuged at 100,000 Xg for 1 h at 4'C. The 100,000 Xg supernatant (S100 fraction) was frozen at -80\u00b0C in storage buffer (adjusted to 0.37 mM DTT, 100 mM KC1, 5% glycerol, and 0.2 mM PMSF). Ribosomal fractions were prepared as described by Kusov et al. (18) with some modifications. Briefly, the 100,000Xg pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM DTT, and 0.1 mM EDTA (pH 7.0). A 4 M solution of KC1 was slowly added to the ribosome suspension to give a final KC1 concentration of 0.5 M in a finnl volume of 1 ml. The solution was stirred at 4'C for 20 min and the ribosomes were pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 x g for 1 h at 4\"C. The pellet was resuspended and washed as above with 0.6 M KC1.

The self-ligated plasmid was digested with BamHI with the resulting 5' overhangs filled by Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs, NEB) and treated with alkaline phosphatase (calf intestine, NEB) to prevent self-ligation. Plasmid pBSK-FULLl4 (19) , which contains the full-length cDNA sequence of LRV1-4, was digested with Smal and Clal, and incubated with Klenow fragment to produce blunt-ends.

            "text": "ST-RNA Forms RNA/RNA Complexes with SC-RNA-Unlabeled ST-RNA, whose 3' end is identical to the short transcript generated from full-length viral RNA {20), was used in competition experiments to test whether it interferes with SC-RNA/protein complexes. At molar excesses as high as 150-fold, ST-RNA failed to compete with any of the three SC-RNA/protein complexes (Fig. 4B, lane 3) , supporting the mobility gel shift data using 32 P-labeled ST-RNA (Fig. 2) . Surprisingly, however, one new slowmigrating complex was formed in the presence of 50-molar excess ST-RNA (Fig. 4B, lane 1) , and a second new slower migrating complex was observed at 100-fold molar excess of ST-RNA (Fig. 4B, lane 2) . Initially, the two new shifted complexes were believed to be SC-/ST-RNA/protein complexes, but their presence in control reactions lacking S100 extract (Fig. 4B, lane 4) identified them as RNA-RNA complexes. In the presence of S100 fraction, however, it seems that the interaction of SC-/ST-RNA is enhanced (compare lanes 2 and 4 in figure 4) , and the two new shifted complexes in the absence of Si00 fraction are always sharp and clear while in the presence of extract they become less sharp and more defuse (data not shown). Therefore, we can not rule out the possibility that some other factor(s) may be involved in the formation of RNA-RNA complexes. Sequence analysis shows 60% reverse-complementarity between the 5'-terminal 113 nt of SC-RNA and nucleotides 46-165 of ST-RNA (data not shown). These findings support the possibility that the two in vivo RNA cleavage products (represented in vitro by SC-and ST-RNA transcripts) might interact with each other. To determine whether ST-RNA competes with the formation of SC-RNA/protein complexes, SC-RNA probe was pre-incubated with different molar excesses of unlabeled ST-RNA before the addition of the Si00 fraction (Fig. 5A) . Pre-incubation with a 100-fold or greater molar excess of ST-RNA (Fig. 5A, lanes 7 to 10) competes effectively with the formation of two of the three SC-RNA/protein complexes. At 200-fold molar excess, only the slowest migrating complex is still detectable, suggesting that the protein involved in that complex has a higher affinity for the viral RNA or, alternatively, that its binding domain overlaps minimally with the RNA/RNA interaction region. In the absence of pre-incubation, however, a 400-fold molar excess of ST-RNA is unable to compete with the formation of these complexes (Fig. 5A, lanes 3 to 6) . The two slowest migrating complexes formed in the presence of excess unlabeled ST-RNA were resistant to DNase but sensitive to incubation (2 min) with RNase A/Tl (Fig. 5B) , showing that the nature of these complexes is RNA. Doubling the ribonuclease concentration was more effective (compare lanes 3 and 4 in Fig. 5B ). Free probe was not completely degraded under these incubation conditions, presumably due to its excess in the reaction. Detection of Proteins Binding to LRV1-4 5' End-To characterize the proteins binding to SC-RNA in the gel mobility shift assays, S100 fraction prepared from Leishmania M4147 cells was incubated with 32 P-labeled RNA probes, and the complexes were covalently cross-linked by UV irradiation. As shown in Fig. 6 , SC-RNA probe labeled several proteins in the extracts (lane 4). Identical results were obtained with Si 00 fraction from either virus-infected or -uninfected cells (data not shown). Protein labeling was entirely dependent upon UV irradiation, and was not detected when labeled FL-RNA was used as a probe (lane 2). These results are consistent with the data obtained in RNA mobility shift experiments. The molecular masses of the three labeled proteins are approximately 29-, 41-, and 49-kDa. Although the signal intensity was dependent on the experimental conditions and varied slightly from experiment to experiment, only SC-RNA was able to form crosslinked complexes with proteins in cytoplasmic extracts.",

Nevertheless, to rule out that possibility, because conformational disruptions or changes could have been induced, the additional 4 nucleotides were removed from the original pSC construct. The resulting clone (pSC-/}BamHI) generates an RNA transcript that starts precisely at viral nucleotide 321, identical to the 5' end of the in vivo cleaved RNA transcript. Gelshift assays using these RNAs (pSC and pSC-dBamHI transcripts) yielded indistinguishable patterns of shifted complexes as shown in Fig. 2 (data not shown) . The UVcrosslinking experiment was then repeated as described in \"MATERIALS AND METHODS\" using the pSC-dBamHI transcript and the results were compared with those using pSC-derived transcripts. The patterns of the labeled RNAprotein complexes were identical for both probes (Fig. 6,  lanes 4 and 6) . Taken together, the results demonstrate conclusively that the additional 4 nucleotides encoded at the 5' end of the SC-RNA probe are not responsible for the differential interactions observed between Leishmania cellular proteins and the cleaved Leishmaniavirus RNA transcripts.",

            "text": "Leishmaniaviruses are believed to establish a persistent infection since no extracellular virus has ever been found (21) . Thus, the productive infection must require a regulatory process so that viral proteins are synthesized in appropriate amounts to maintain the viral particle number at a level compatible with cellular function without inducing a shut-off of host cell macromolecular synthesis. Competitive RT-PCR experiments have shown the presence of about 100 copies of the viral genome per cell (unpublished data). The cleavage of viral transcripts could be a mechanism by which the virus controls its gene expression. Removal of the 5' end could presumably affect RNA stability, RNA packaging, replication, and translation. These regulatory mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and may all contribute to balance the virus/parasite ratio in Leishmania cells. The 5' end of the LRV1-4 positive sense RNA, like that of picornaviruses, is a long, highly structured non-coding region with multiple non-initiator AUGs (4) . The absence of trans-spliced viral RNA in vivo and the lack of a cap structure at the 5' end strongly suggest that LRV1 has evolved an internal initiation mechanism of translation. Internal initiation in picornavirus requires the interaction of cellular proteins with an IRES element in the viral 5' UTR (22) . Several of these proteins have been identified, but the functional roles for the majority of the frans-acting factors remain to be elucidated.",

The UV-cross linking study shows that several proteins from the Leishmania cell extract bind only to the cleaved viral 5' end (represented by SC-RNA), but not to the full-length transcript (represented by FL-RNA). The sizes of the three major Leishmania proteins cross-linked to the RNA are approximately 29-, 41-, and 49-kDa. These proteins are present at similar concentrations in both virus-infected and -uninfected parasite strains, suggesting that they are not induced by viral infection. It is difficult to speculate on the nature and putative roles of the crosslinked proteins identified in the experiments presented here because little is known about the translation machinery in Leishmania. Therefore, the nature of these proteins remains to be identified in the future.",

Our results suggest that the domains are either non-functional or unavailable in the full-length viral 5' end (represented by FL-RNA). Presumably, cleavage of full-length RNA unmasks a cryptic domain that is now accessible to bind host factors.

Although other roles in the viral cycle can not be ruled out, cleavage of viral RNA by its own viral capsid protein may generate an RNA devoid of translation inhibiting sequences, such as non-initiating AUGs, for example. The LRV1 5' UTR may also provide a challenge to the translational machinery of the cell considering its length and presumed secondary and possibly tertiary structure which could impede ribosome movement. Intraleader ORFs have been shown to accumulate at the viral 5' end of some coronaviruses during the establishment of a persistent infection (27) . Our in vitro translation data suggest that LRV transcripts from 5' end deletion mutants are translated more efficiently than those with a complete 5' UTR (unpublished data). However, those transcripts are all translated at very low efficiency compared to non-viral RNAs. It seems likely that some specific host factors required for the efficient translation initiation of viral transcripts in Leishmania are absent from the wheat germ and rabbit reticulocyte translation systems. It remains to be determined whether the Leishmania proteins cross-linked to SC-RNA in the present studies are also present in these in vitro translation systems.",

Constructs lacking the first 120 nt of the LRV1-4 5' end showed a 10-fold reducion in the translation of a downstream reporter gene in a dicistronic construct (15) . This result is somehow contradictory to our in vitro translation study described in above. The discrepancy can be explained by the fact that these experiments were performed by transfecting the expression construct into an L. major strain, which is not a natural host for LRV1. Due to the high divergence between LRV1 and LRV2 (less than 40% homology), it remains possible that the two viruses have evolved different translation strategies optimized for function in their respective Leishmania host strains. Indeed, a co-evolution theory has been proposed based on the phylogenetic comparison of LRV genomes and DNA fingerprints from host parasite strains (28) , shows a positive correlation between virus and parasite genetic distances. While optimal activation of the viral transcript for translation may require precise cleavage, residual IRES activity may exist in the full-length 5' end. It is very possible that removal of these first 120 nt simply disrupts the secondary structure of the downstream domains required for internal ribosome entry.",

Sequence analysis identified an 113-nt sequence of SC-RNA with reverse complement to nucleotides 46 to 165 of ST-RNA, raising the possibility that the two products of the RNA cleavage may also interact in vivo. These complexes were formed in a dose-dependent manner and, when the molar excess of competitor ST-RNA was raised from 50-to 100-fold, a second RNA/RNA complex appeared, presumably formed through the addition of a second molecule of ST-RNA. We do not have any more information about this second complex and further analysis needs to be done. To detect the possibility of competition between ST-RNA and the host factors for SC-RNA (presumably masked by an excess of probe), binding experiments with a previous incubation of both RNAs were carried out. Pre-incubation of ST-RNA with the SC-RNA probe prevented the formation of the two fast-migrating SC-RNA/protein complexes and reduced the amount of a slow-migrating SC-RNA/ protein complex showing that the presence of the short transcript (ST) can interfere with protein-binding to the cleaved (SC) RNA. If those RNAs interact in vivo as they do in vitro, then the short transcript generated by cleavage can be expected to prevent protein from binding to the cleaved RNA transcript and thus interfere with any function that protein binding may have in translation initiation. This activity may represent a regulatory mechanism allowing the virus to establish fine control of the ratio of bound and unbound cleaved transcripts to host factors.",
