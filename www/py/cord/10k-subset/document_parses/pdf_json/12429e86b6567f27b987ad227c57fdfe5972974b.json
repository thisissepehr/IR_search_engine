Results: Timely infant testing for HIV accounted for 346(62.0%). Mothers who attended antenatal care (AOR: 2.77; 95% CI: 1.17, 6.55) and who were counselled on feeding options (AOR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.11, 3.65) were strongly associated with timely infant testing. Poor maternal adherence status was associated with infants' HIV positivity at the 18th month of antibody test (AOR: 15.93; 95% CI: 2.21, 94.66).

Conclusions: A considerable proportion of exposed infants did not undergo timely testing for HIV.
