We investigate the variation in the inhomogeneity of the distribution of the epidemic with the absolute velocity v of moving agent, the infection density q, and the interaction radius r. By comparing d \u00c3 in the dynamic networks with d \u00c3 H in homogeneous mode, the simulation experiments show that the inhomogeneity of epidemic spreading becomes smaller with the increase of v, q, r.

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Among the most studied models for investigating the spread of epidemic, susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) and susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic models are two famous epidemiological models. 7, 8 When studying the epidemic spreading with these models in complex networks, researchers often adopt homogeneous mixing hypotheses [9] [10] [11] [12] which each infected agent has same probability of contact with any susceptible agent. However, such a hypothesis is not strong and should be thoroughly discussed. Recently, researchers have discussed the credibility of the hypothesis. For instance, Liu et al. implement the distribution of an epidemic is always inhomogeneous after the transition process in Refs. 13 and 14, where they present the characteristic infected cluster size (CICS), which characterizes the inhomogeneity of the epidemic spreading. However, the CICS measurement studied on the typical size of the largest infected cluster, which cannot reflect the infected clusters.",

In statistical physics, cluster entropy has been used in the study of problems, such as percolation 15, 16 and complex systems. Cluster entropy was utilized within the Axelrod model to measures the number of cultural groups of different sizes. 17 Cluster-size entropy was also used in the Axelrod's cultural adaptation model which gives information on the variability of the cultural cluster size present in the system. 18 In the paper, the normalized entropy based on infected clusters (d \u00c3 ) can reflect the variability of the infected clusters in dynamic model. In addition in order to characterize the inhomogeneity of the epidemic spreading, we denote the Homogeneous Mode 13 where all the infected agents are randomly distributed and keep static in the system, is used to represent the case where the epidemic is homogeneously distributed. For the convenience of discussion, we denote the d \u00c3 of homogeneous mode as d \u00c3 H . Therefore, for given infection density q, the larger jd \u00c3 \u00c0 d \u00c3 H j is, the more inhomogeneous the epidemic spreading is.",

It is assumed that agents M are distributed randomly in a square of linear size L with periodic boundary conditions initially. Each agent can jump into any position (i.e., long position) inside the square with the probability q or perform the local motion with the probability 1 \u00c0 q. Considering the fact that the jumping process is much shorter than the infection period, we assume that the status of the jumping agents will be kept when it move.

And then we update agents' state synchronously in the model for Dt (Dt is set to 1) time steps. All data points shown in each figure are acquired by averaging over 50 runs. In Fig. 1 , one can find that the distributions of the infected clusters are different when the infection density q \u00bc m=L 2 is different and r \u00bc 1. When q is low, the infected agents can scatter small clusters with similar size as shown in Figs. 1(a)-1(c) .

However, d \u00c3 can give information on the variability of the infected clusters. Next, we will discuss the inhomogeneity of the epidemic spreading by a comparable analysis on d \u00c3 in the dynamic networks and d \u00c3 H in homogeneous mode.

The reason for this is that when the infection rate a is large, the probability that a susceptible agent is infected by its infected neighbors is also high. Thus, more susceptible agents get infected. In addition, the result of numerical simulation shows that q is close to 1 with the increase of a and q.",

            "text": "When r \u00bc 1, v \u00bc 0:5, we can plot d \u00c3 versus q with different q (as illustrated in Fig. 3 ). The comparable curve in homogeneous mode (d \u00c3 H ) is also given in Fig. 3 with black color. It shows that d \u00c3 is close to d \u00c3 H when q ! 1, which it means the infected agents are distributed homogeneously. Obviously, this conclusion is coincident with that of theoretical analysis. However, d \u00c3 is apparently less than d \u00c3 H when q 2 \u00bd0; 0:6\u00de and q 2 \u00bd0:2; 0:7 which it means the epidemic spreading is inhomogeneous. This conclusion by letting q \u00bc 0 is coincident with that of previous results. 13 To study the effect of the absolute velocity v on the inhomogeneity of the epidemic spreading when q 2 \u00bd0:2; 0:7, q 2 \u00bd0; 0:6\u00de and r \u00bc 1, Fig. 4 demonstrates the d \u00c3 as a function of v for different values of q with q \u00bc0.15, 0.25, and 0.35, respectively. To comparison, in Fig. 4(a) we plot six curves (v \u00bc0.3, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 10, respectively) of dynamic network and a straight line (d \u00c3 H ) of homogeneous mode when q \u00bc 0:3. Similarly, Figs. 4(b) and 4(c) show the situations when q \u00bc0.5, 0.7, respectively. One can find that the variation of the inhomogeneity is related to v. When v 2 \u00f00:1; 2, d \u00c3 is apparently less than d \u00c3 H for each q. That means, the epidemic spreads inhomogeneously. When v > 2, d \u00c3 is close to d \u00c3 H for each q. Namely, the epidemic spreading is homogeneous. In fact, when the agents move with a high velocity, they have greater chance to jump out of the area that is covered by its infected neighbors than that in the case of small v. Therefore, the infected agents cannot gather into a large cluster. In addition, The infected density q affect the difference between the maximum and minimum of d \u00c3 . When q \u00bc 0:3 and v \u00bc 0:1 (or v \u00bc 2) d max \u00c0 d min \u00bc 0:22\u00f00:05\u00de; when q \u00bc 0:7 and v \u00bc 0:1 (or v \u00bc 2) d max \u00c0 d min \u00bc 0:02\u00f00:01\u00de:",

            "text": "Then we can say that the smaller is the infected density q, the stronger v affects the inhomogeneity of the epidemic spreading. And the finding is in accordance with the previous work. 13 Previous results 13, 14 have not discussed about the role of the interaction radius r on the inhomogeneity of the epidemic spreading. Fig. 5 presents d \u00c3 as a function of a for various v when r \u00bc 1, q \u00bc 0. One can find the epidemic spreads inhomogeneously when v 2, a < 0:6. Next, suppose r 2 \u00bd1; 2, we plot d \u00c3 against r for different values of a when q \u00bc 0, v \u00bc 0:5 in Fig. 6 . As can be seen in Fig. 6 , d \u00c3 is approaching to d \u00c3 H with the increase of r which it means that the epidemic spreading tends to a homogeneous state. Our results indicate the inhomogeneity decreases even disappears with the increase of r. And one can see that d \u00c3 monotonously decreases with the increase of r. The reason for this is that the neighbors can infect each other in interaction neighborhoods which are determined by the radius r at each time step. As pairwise interactions increase with r, it is possible for a susceptible agent to be infected more by its infected neighbors. So the infected agents are prone to form large infected clusters.",
