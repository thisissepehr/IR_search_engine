However, when considered together, there was good agreement (Table 2 ). This, in part, may have been because of a lack of agreement among the radiologists as to the criteria for clearly differentiating between the two observations. The kappa statistics for nodular densities and parenchymal consolidation, considered as \u00aaabsent\u00ba vs. \u00aapresent\u00ba, were 0.56 and 0.57 respectively, both suggesting moderate agreement among the radiologists (Table 1) . However, the strength of agreement for lung volume (normal vs. low vs. increased) was low (kappa = 0.21). Since the prevalence of children with an enlarged heart as read by the original reader was only 6.9 %, and the observed and chance agreements were high (90.5 % and 87.7 % respectively) (Table 1) , the low kappa statis-885 tic of 0.23 may be misleading. It is well recognized that the statistic depends upon the proportion of children (prevalence) in each category. If more children with an enlarged heart had been included in the study but the observed agreement remained the same, the kappa statistic would be greater because the chance agreement would be lower. Among group I children, 194 had at least one cardiac echo study and at least one radiograph. Of these, there were 38 infants who had a z-score for echo-determined end-diastolic dimension (EDD) of greater than 2.0; 15 (39 %) also had notation of an enlarged heart on chest radiograph. Of the remaining 156 children who never had an EDD z-score > 2.0, 119 (76 %) never had an enlarged heart on radiography (S. E. Lipshultz, personal communication).
