Tidal volume size was similar between the groups. Higher P max was a potentially modifiable ventilatory variable associated with in-hospital mortality in multivariable analyses. \u0394P was not independently associated with in-hospital mortality, but reliable values for \u0394P were available for 343 patients only. Non-modifiable factors associated with in-hospital mortality were older age, presence of immunosuppression, higher non-pulmonary sequential organ failure assessment scores, lower pulse oximetry readings, higher heart rates, and functional dependence.",

While inadequately too low positive end-expiratory pressures (PEEP) have been demonstrated to worsen outcome of patients with ARDS, especially in moderate or severe cases [7] , patients without ARDS likely do not benefit from higher PEEP [8] .

First, V T size decreased over time, not only in patients with ARDS [10, [12] [13] [14] , but also in patients at risk of ARDS [11] . Presently, V T above 10 to 12 ml/kg predicted body weight (PBW) is seldom used. The median PEEP level that is set has increased over time in patients without ARDS [11, 13, 14] . In patients with ARDS, higher levels of PEEP usually are restricted to patients with more severe hypoxemia [7, 10, 15] . Both investigations, though, suggested there is still potential for improvement in ventilatory management in critically ill patients [10, 11] , and one recently published secondary analysis of LUNG SAFE showed that lower PEEP, higher peak inspiratory (P peak ), plateau (P plat ), \u0394P, and increased respiratory rate represent potentially modifiable factors contributing to worse outcome in patients with ARDS [16] .",

In the present analysis, P max was the single ventilator factor associated with in-hospital mortality, suggesting this is the only potentially modifiable factor in these patients. Parts of our findings are in line with prior studies in this field. Older age is independently associated with worse outcome in patients with ARDS [16, 24, 25] and patients without ARDS [13] , and also immunosuppression is a risk factor for mortality in our study and in trials that included patients with ARDS [16, 25] . Severity of illness factors associated with outcome was a higher heart rate and higher non-pulmonary SOFA score, consistent with previous studies in patients with [16, 25] , as well as in patients without ARDS [13] . In addition to the results of the LUNG SAFE [16] , we here show that, irrespective of the presence of ARDS, older patients, patients with immunosuppression, patients with high non-pulmonary SOFA score, and higher heart rate are at increased risk of worse outcomes. Ventilatory support with a higher P max was independently associated with both increased hospital mortality and ICU mortality. This finding is in accordance with previous studies where higher P max was associated with worse outcomes, for example increased risk of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) [26, 27] , and increased mortality in patients without ARDS [13] and those with ARDS [16, 21, 28, 29] . \u0394P was only associated with ICU mortality and not with in-hospital mortality. It should be recognized, though, that that analysis was only possible for 343 patients, and this smaller sample size may have reduced the power so that there was no association between \u0394P and in-hospital mortality. This could also be concluded from the results of the post hoc analysis of P max , using the same smaller cohort of patients. Nevertheless, the finding that \u0394P was not associated with in-hospital mortality is in line with a recently published investigation in a cohort of patients without ARDS [30] . In addition, the small range of tidal volumes used in this cohort also led to a small range of \u0394P, which could blunt the effect of \u0394P on mortality, which may be much subtler than is found in patients with ARDS [9] . Similar findings came from a recently published study that failed to find an association between \u0394P and mortality, even though their results show a trend for higher mortality rates with each cm H 2 O increase of \u0394P [30] . Yet the influence of \u0394P on outcome is consistent with previous reports exposing the importance of \u0394P on development of pulmonary complications also in patients without ARDS undergoing general anesthesia for surgery [31] , and on ventilator-induced diaphragmatic injury in critically patients receiving mechanical ventilation [32] . Similarly, experimental studies suggested an association between higher \u0394P and development of VILI. In studies considering patients with ARDS, \u0394P was the ventilation variable that best stratified mortality risk, even in those undergoing ECMO for refractory hypoxemia [9, 16, 28, 33, 34] .",

The lack of a relationship between V T and outcome in the present study likely reflects the widespread adoption of lower V T ventilation, as V T in our cohort concentrated in a narrow range around a median of 7.9 ml/kg PBW. With less patients receiving ventilation with high V T , the association between V T and outcome was no longer present. This finding is in line with the abovementioned recently published investigation in a cohort of patients without ARDS [30] .

Nevertheless, most trials performed so far that addressed the effects of PEEP on outcomes in ICU patients without ARDS were relatively small and mainly assessed other outcomes than mortality, for example development of pulmonary complications [8] .

These findings are particularly important since PRoVENT found differences between the ventilatory management of patients at risk and not at risk of ARDS [11] . While within the inspiratory capacity, the only independent variable for VILI is dynamic strain, i.e., V T , above the inspiratory capacity, the combination of all ventilation parameters can lead to VILI and worse outcome [43, 44] .",

It is important to note that we classified pulse oximetry as non-modifiable; however, one could argue that this is modifiable through adjustment of FiO 2 . Also, although respiratory variables are potentially modifiable, adjustment of the ventilator can be influenced by certain non-modifiable factors that are present at the time of adjustment. For example, PEEP is affected by hypoxemia; some protocols allow higher plateau pressures in the presence of severe acidemia, and \u0394P is directly influenced by changes in the respiratory system compliance. These interactions are complex, and ventilator settings may not always turn out to be modifiable when treating a patient. Another limitation is the use of maximal airway pressure in pressure-controlled mode as a surrogate for the plateau pressure to calculate \u0394P, although this was only done when there was no proof of spontaneous breathing efforts to minimize erroneous measurements. Prospective trials are needed investigating specifically the directly measured pressures in the lung, including the transpulmonary driving",
