Sixteen kidney samples (clear cell RCC) were investigated to determine the differences in the protein components between renal cancer and surrounding tissues, using HPLC analysis. The metallothionein (MT) and zinc levels were consistently lower in renal cancer tissues compared with in surrounding tissues. The mean concentration of MT in normal tissues surrounding renal tumors was about 15 times higher than that in cancer tissues. An immunohistochemical study confirmed that the expression of MT in renal cancer tissues was lower than that in adjacent normal tissues. The activities of aminopeptidases (APs) were significantly decreased in renal cancer tissues compared with in adjacent normal tissues. An immunohistochemical study and Western blot analysis confirmed that the expression of AP-N in renal cancer tissues was also lower than in adjacent normal tissues. These results suggest that the immunohistochemical detection of MT and AP-N could provide useful information as a pathological diagnostic tool for classifying renal cancer and surrounding tissues.",

Zinc is an essential heavy metal in the human body, and is most abundant in prostate tissue (1) and is a constituent of more than 200 enzymes. Zinc plays an important role in nucleic acid metabolism, cell replication, tissue repair, and growth, and is required for tumor growth (2) . Although several studies have focused on the evaluation of the zinc concentration in renal cell carcinomas, the concentration has been reported to vary, as it is high and low. This seems to result from the great fluctuation of the zinc concentration in kidney tissues.",

This protein is also involved in the detoxification of nonphysiological metals and plays a protective role in metal-stressed individuals (3) . Both serum and urinary MT have been observed to increase significantly in metal-stressed individuals. Exposure to heavy metal cations, both in vivo and in vitro, has been associated with alteration of immune responses and immunotoxicity. The long term result of this can be autoimmunity, immunosuppression, or even cellular transformation (4) . Most MT binding of heavy metals is intracellular, but extracellular forms of the protein are released from injured or dead cells. Tumor cells can cause injury to and death of the surrounding normal tissues, thereby increasing the MT level in the extracellular space. The biosynthesis of MT has been reported to be regulated by steroid hormones (5) . MT also seems to participate in the scavenging of oxygen free radicals (6) , and has also been implicated in drug resistance in cancer chemotherapy (7) .",

This molecule is a zinc ion-dependent exopeptidase which cleaves neutral amino acids from the N-terminals of oligopeptides. It is well known to be highly expressed on the brush border membranes of the small intestine and renal proximal tubules (9) . In fact, AP-N constitutes 8% of the total protein in the intestinal brush border membrane, where it participates in the final hydrolysis of ingested nutrients. This enzyme is also present in the breast (10), colon (11) , and synaptic membranes of the central nervous system (12) . It has been reported that the neuropeptides, enkephalin and endorphin, are principally degraded by AP-N. AP-N might also act as a corona virus receptor (13) , and has been implicated in antigen processing (14) . Further reported functions of AP-N include degradation of collagen type IV with a proposed role in tumor invasion (15) . Although AP-N expression in tumor progression is involved in growth (16) and metastasis (17, 18) , the precise relation of AP-N to renal cancer remains unclear.",

This protein participates in the absorption, metabolism, transport, and storage of essential metals such as zinc and copper. MT contributes to the detoxification of heavy metal cations in the human body since heavy metal cations bound with MT do not exert toxicity in cells. Although zinc is an essential element for humans, many animal experiments have demonstrated that an increase in the zinc level is necessary during tumor growth. The levels of MT and zinc in liver were reported to increase during experimental carcinogenesis (21) . Jin et al.

The concentration of zinc was reported to increase in human malignant disease with concomitent overexpression of MT (23) . In contrast, Zaichick et al. (24) reported that the zinc level markedly decreased in human prostatic adenocarcinomas as compared with in normal tissue. The present study also demonstrates that the zinc levels in renal cancer tissues significantly decrease as compared with in surrounding normal tissues, implying that the zinc levels decrease with carcinogenesis in renal tissues. The decrease of MT in renal cancer tissues was observed to be greater than that of zinc These findings suggest that the lower zinc levels in the renal cancer tissues cause the reduction of the amount of MT (Fig.  2 ). Since Gunshin et al. (25) recently reported and cloned the divalent cation transporter which probably imported zinc into cells, this decrease in the zinc level may seem to be based on a disorder of zinc import in the cancer tissues. It is unclear from the results of this study whether the import system of zinc was damaged or not. Although Saika et al. (26) have also investigated the expression of MT in renal cell carcinomas, their conclusion was more ambiguous than the results of the present study.",

            "text": "Aminopeptidase A (AP-A)/gpl60 is known to be a differentiation-related kidney glycoprotein which is expressed on the surface of epithelial cells of the glomerulus and proximal tubule cells of the human nephron (27). Nanus et al. (28) reported that alterations of the AP-A protein, including loss of protein expression or enzymatic activity, occurred in -20% of primary clear cell renal cancers. In this study, however, we demonstrated that the activities of APs were significantly decreased in cancer tissues compared with in adjacent normal tissues, suggesting decreases in other AP(s) except AP-A, Therefore, we speculated that changes in the levels of other AP caused significant differences in the activities of APs. To identify the AP that decreased in renal cancer tissue, we performed Western blot analysis and immiinohist/Trhpmiflrry, using a specific antibody against the purified AP-N. AP-N is well known to be highly expressed on the renal proximal tubules (9) , while the precise relation of AP-N to renal cancer remains unclear. In human renal cancer tissues, the expression of AP-N was observed to decrease markedly as compared with in normal surrounding tissues. The expression of AP-N is also known to increase in acute myeloblastic leukemia and in some cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Bogenrieder et al. (29) reported that AP-N was strongly expressed in benign prostatic epithelial cells, but not in primary and metastatic prostate cancer. Moreover, it has been reported that the expression of AP-N in breast and colonic carcinomas is not related to the stage of the cancer (10, 11) . Since AP-N is a zinc-dependent exopeptidase, zinc is necessary for its enzymatic activity. In tumor progression, AP-N participates in growth (26) and metastasis (17, 18) , suggesting that there is a close relationship between AP-N expression and the progression of tumor cells. However, the amount of AP-N in renal cancer tissues has been demonstrated to decrease accompanying a decrease in the zinc level in this study (Fig.  4) . The expression of AP-N may be related to the zinc levels in renal cancer tissues because zinc is necessary for the enzymatic activity of AP-N.",
