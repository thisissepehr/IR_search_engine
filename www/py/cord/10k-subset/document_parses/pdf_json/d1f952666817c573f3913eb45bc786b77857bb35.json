We were particularly interested in identifying cellular proteins that interact with fiber knob, which is the moiety within the Ad capsid responsible for high-affinity attachment of virus to cellular receptors. We used recombinant fiber knob domains from members of group C and B Ads to purify virus interacting proteins from cell membrane lysates and from human and mouse plasma. Using tandem mass spectrometry, we identified a number of candidate Ad-interacting proteins, including functional cellular receptors and previously unknown interacting partners such as complement component C4-binding protein and other blood proteins that presumably are involved in Ad infection after intravenous virus application. The ability of these proteins to bind to Ad was further confirmed using in vitro protein binding assays as well as infection competition assays. The approach of using a structural protein can be universally applied for a variety of viral and nonviral pathogens and can reveal host cell factors critical in viral infection, immune evasion, and tissue specificity. This information is also a prerequisite to assess in vivo safety and efficacy of Ad-based gene transfer vectors.",

There are 51 known serotypes of human Ad, and these are grouped into groups A to F (9). Viruses from different groups have different cell tropism, in part because of the usage of different attachment receptors. For many Ads, including serotypes from all groups except B, the Coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR) can serve as a primary cellular attachment protein (10-12). Group B Ads, however, do not use CAR, and until recently their cellular receptor remained unknown (13-15).",

For many proteins, mammalian-specific modifications are central to their biological function. Further, proteins often function in complexes with other proteins or in multimers, and this type of analysis is difficult in twohybrid systems.

However, when Ad5*F infection was conducted in the presence of C4BP, a marked increase in vector infectivity toward these cells was observed (Fig. 4B, C4BP) . 1. Plate 2 \u00d7 10 5 HepG2 cells in 12-well plates and allow to grow overnight. 2. Use purified Ad5 * F at a multiplicity of infection of 50 PFU/cell and add to cells in the presence of increasing amounts of C4BP (up to 250 \u03bcg/mL, which is the physiological level in human plasma) in a total volume of 300 \u03bcL growth medium and incubate at 37\u00b0C for 3 h. 3. Wash cells several times with PBS and incubate in growth medium overnight. 4. Assess GFP fluorescence of cells using fluorescence microscope or flow cytometry analysis.",

Using Ad receptor-interacting fiber knob domain as bait, we recovered and identified a protein, C4BP, from whole mouse plasma that modulates virus infectivity toward both susceptible (CHO-C2 for Ad5/35) and resistant (HepG2 for Ad5*F) cell types. It should be noted that the other proteins identified through MS/MS analysis were confirmed to bind to Ad fiber knob domain in slot-blot assays, and future studies will determine the functional role of these interactions. Despite the complexity of mouse plasma protein composition, we were able to rapidly identify new Ad-interacting partners, which will have implications for Ad vector development. The approach of using a structural protein to identify host factors critical in viral infection, immune evasion, and tissue specificity can be universally applied for a variety of viral and nonviral pathogens and can reveal new targets for prospective therapies.",

            "text": "1. Ad DNA for amplification of the fiber knob domain was extracted using standard DNA extraction techniques from purified viral particles of wild-type Ad of various serotypes. Fiber knob domains were amplified using primers encompassing the last repeat of the shaft domain and the entire fiber knob domain. The last repeat of the shaft is necessary because it is required for proper trimerization of the recombinant protein. 2. Biotinylation of proteins using the described methods adds a biotin molecule to the lysine residues throughout the peptide. This can theoretically aid in recovery because a single protein can have multiple biotinylation sites that can be used for precipitation, allowing for increased yield. Disadvantages of this technique include an added manipulation of the purified protein. Specifically, biotinylation of lysine residues that are important in protein-protein interactions might affect the outcome of this method. Testing if the biotinylated protein can still bind to a protein of interest (by either competitive experiments or virus overlay protein blot assays) can help to confirm if a protein retains functionality after biotinylation. The use of the 6-histidine tag also has advantages and disadvantages. The advantages include less manipulation of the protein because it has an incorporated tag as well as the fact that it is likely not involved in interactions because it is (in this example) far from putative interaction sites. Another advan-tage is that elution of precipitated proteins can be done without contamination with bait proteins (see Fig. 1 ). The disadvantages include a potentially weak signal, with only one bait protein per polypeptide, that may not be readily accessible in nondenatured conditions. Further, the Ni 2+ -agarose beads are not compatible with certain conditions that may be required for protein purification (such as increased EDTA solutions). 3. Using epithelial cell lines such as HeLa cells can often produce large amounts of keratins that tend to contaminate MS/MS samples. The choice of cell type can be determined by identifying those cells likely to produce abundant receptor molecules (e.g., by infectivity assays). 4. Depending on the type of beads used, a second preclearing round can be done, especially if the beads appear to bind to proteins abundant in plasma. 5. To reduce nonspecific binding to Ni 2+ -NTA beads, add 10 mM imidazole to the wash solution. Also, if nonspecific background binding is high, consider washing samples with PBS in the presence of a nonionic detergent, such as 0.1% NP-40. 6. It is especially important to wash many times when using serum proteins because the abundant proteins like albumin can often contaminate samples even after four washes if less abundant proteins are being analyzed. 7. For better likelihood of successful identification by MS/MS analysis, do not fix the gel with formaldehyde during silver staining. 8. Urea can disrupt trypsin activity and, if this contaminant is too high, will result in suboptimal peptide recovery. A second concentration step can be performed in the same microcon container by again increasing the volume to 500 \u03bcL using PBS and concentrating to 50 \u03bcL. Also, the molecular-weight cutoff of the filter can be adjusted to enrich in particular weights of target proteins. 9. These experiments utilized the convenience of pseudotyped vectors with an easily assayable transgene. These experiments can also be performed with wild-type Ad using cytopathic effect as a primary outcome instead of GFP transgene expression. 10. The choice of HepG2 as a cell line was made because of previous observations that liver infection in vivo by Ad5-based vectors is not CAR dependent and likely is mediated by other serum factors. Using a vector abolished for CAR-binding, we are better able to assay the contribution of our newly discovered blood factors to infection of these human liver-derived cells in the absence of CAR binding.",
