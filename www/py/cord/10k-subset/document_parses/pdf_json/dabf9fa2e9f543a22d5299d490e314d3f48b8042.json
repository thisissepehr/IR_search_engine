They have shown to be effective at targeting malignant cells without being direct effectors of graft-versus-host disease in both a transplantation setting and as an NK cell therapy alone. There have been numerous clinical trials using NK cells as an adoptive immunotherapy in both hematological and solid malignancies. These have shown NK cell immunotherapy to be safe however efficacy has been inconsistent. Material (or patients) and methods: In order to strive towards an effective and robust clinical therapy we hypothesize that proliferation, persistence and activation of NK cells in vivo is fundamental for the development of a clinically relevant cellular product that will be able to target tumor cells efficiently in patients. Our group has previously shown that frozen CD34 + cells isolated from umbilical cord blood (UCB) are the most favorable source of stem cells to differentiate functional NK cells in vitro. Producing large cell numbers capable of secreting high levels of IFN-g and killing leukemic cell lines in vitro. We therefore tested whether the differentiated NK cells are capable of proliferating and getting activated following further cytokine stimulation and if they are able to persist in vivo to target and eliminate leukemic cells. We also assessed if the cells could be frozen and thawed whilst still maintaining functionality to allow for the production of a readily available off-the-shelf cellular product. Results: We found that the differentiated NK cells could respond to interleukin-2 and proliferate in vitro to the same degree as adult peripheral blood NK cells. This suggests that the cells can further respond to cytokines and proliferate once injected into the patient. The function of the differentiated cells was unaffected by cryopreservation allowing for multiple infusions at different time points of the same NK product. The differentiated NK cells could kill leukemic cells and more importantly could persist for longer and in higher numbers in vivo over other sources of NK cells, indicative of improved survival post infusion. Additionally we assessed pre-activation of the cells by priming the differentiated NK cells using CTV-1 lysate. In comparison to resting controls this consistently led to higher levels of killing of patient leukemic blasts in vitro, however this activation step was not required to observe killing of patient AML blasts in vivo. This indicates that the cells would not require prior activation before infusion resulting in a cellular therapy that was more economical and more easily translatable to the clinic. Conclusion: In conclusion, we are able to generate and cryopreserve NK cells from UCB hematopoietic stem cells in high numbers allowing for multiple infusions that are highly cytotoxic towards tumor cells. These cells can further proliferate in response to additional cytokines and have a clear survival advantage in vivo over other sources of NK cells.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "This provides the potential for the development of a robust NK cell immunotherapy which can not only prevent infection post transplantation but also target malignancies in their own right to prevent relapse.

Di Bartolomeo 1 1 Hematology, BMT Center, O SPEDALE C IVILE, Pescara, Italy Introduction: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is a potentially curative option for patients with lymphoproliferative disorders such as Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). For patients who relapse or have refractory disease after SCT, the use of donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) represent an important part of the strategy to enhance graft-versus-lymphoma effect (GvL) . In this study we evaluate how DLI is able to control the disease in patients with lymphoma who relapse or have persistent disease after SCT. Material (or patients) and methods: Between February 2001 and July 2012, 7 patients (3 males) with advanced lymphoma (high grade NHL n = 5, HL n = 2) previously treated with SCT received DLI as treatment for progressive or relapsed disease. The median age was 35 (21-52) years at time of SCT. Three of them underwent previous autologous SCT. All patients were transplanted with PBSC, 6 from HLA identical donor and 1 from an unrelated one. Conditioning was myeloablative in 1 and reduced intensity in 6. GvHD prophylaxis included Cyclosporine and short course methotrexate in all patients. Results: No patient developed DLI-related aplasia or acute GvHD after DLI. Limited chronic GvHD was observed in only 2 patients. Three patients had no response to DLI and died for progression of their lymphoma. Four patients had sustained complete response with persistent and continued disappearance of the lymphoma. The cumulative response rates after DLI to treat relapse or persistent disease after SCT were 3/4 (75%) and 1/3 (33%), respectively. No correlation was observed between CD3+ cell dose infused and disease response. Both patients who developed DLI-related chronic GvHD had complete response. All four patients who achieved complete response after DLI are still alive and disease-free after a median follow-up of 11 (9-12) years. Conclusion: These data support the existence of a clinically significant GvL effect in high-grade NHL and aggressive HL suggesting that DLI is an effective treatment able to induce long-term remission without severe GvHD in patients with very poor prognosis. A DLI program should always be considered for patients with lymphoma who show persistent disease or relapse after SCT.

Delorme 1,* 1 Biotherapy Division, Macopharma, Mouvaux, 2 Transfusion Division, Macopharma, Tourcoing, France Introduction: We recently developed and characterized a standardized and clinical grade human Platelet Lysate (hPL) that constitutes an advantageous substitute for fetal bovine serum for human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) expansion required in cell therapy procedures, avoiding xenogenic risks (virological and immunological) and ethical issue. Because of the progressive use of pathogen reduced (PR) labile blood components, we evaluated the impact of the novel procedure THERAFLEX UV-Platelets for pathogen reduction on hPL quality (growth factors content) and efficacy (as a medium supplement for hMSC expansion). This technology is based on short-wave ultraviolet light (UV-C) and has the main advantage not to need the addition of any photosensitizing additive compounds (that might secondary interfere with hMSCs). Material (or patients) and methods: We applied THERAFLEX UV-Platelets procedure on fresh platelet concentrates (PCs) suspended in platelet additive solution and prepared hPL from these treated PCs. We compared the quality and efficacy of PR-hPL with the corresponding non-PR ones. Results: We showed no impact on the content in 5 cytokines tested (EGF, bFGF, PDGF-AB, VEGF and IGF) and a significant decrease in TGF-b1 (-21%, n = 16, P o0.01). We performed large scale culture of hMSCs during 3 passages and showed that hPL or PR-hPL at 8% triggered comparable hMSC proliferation than FBS at 10% plus bFGF (n = 3). Moreover, after proliferation of hMSCs in hPL or PR-hPL containing medium, their profile of membrane marker expression, their clonogenic potential and immunosuppressive properties were maintained, in comparison with hMSCs cultured in FBS conditions. The potential to differentiate in adipogenic and osteogenic lineages of hMSCs cultured in parallel in the 3 conditions remained also identical. Conclusion: In conclusion, we demonstrated the feasibility to use UV-C treatment to subsequently obtain pathogen reduced hPL, while preserving its optimal quality and efficacy for hMSC expansion for cell therapy applications. Introduction: In patients with myeloma, it might be necessary to perform more than one autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (ASCT). At our centre, we have been have asked to refreeze parts of autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) units with high cell numbers, that already have been stored for several years. The idea is to use the refrozen part of the cells if there is a need for re-transplantation. This raises the question of the viability of the graft. Material (or patients) and methods: The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of refreezing on HSC regarding the amount of CD34+ cells, cell viability, apoptosis and regeneration ability. HSC products from ten deceased patients, stored for more than 8 years, were analyzed regarding the amount of CD34+ cells, cell viability measured with 7-AAD and apoptosis measured with Annexin V. We used flowcytometry for the analysis. The regeneration ability of HSC was analyzed with colony forming units. Results: Refreezing of HSC product, did not affect the amount of CD34+ cells significantly. However a significant decrease in cell viability, with a mean of 20%, was seen. The number of apoptotic cells was significantly increased with 26%. The regenerative ability, measured as colony forming units, decreased significantly with a mean of 31%. Conclusion: It can be concluded, that refreezing of HSC product decreases the number of viable CD34+ cells with approximately 30%. Disclosure of Interest: None declared. Introduction: Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is largely employed as an alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells in the treatment of hematological diseases. One of the limitations to use UCB is the relative low content of hematopoietic stem cells. The main parameters used in umbilical cord blood banks include total nucleated cell (TNC) count, percentage of CD34+ cells and collection volume. The Leuven Cord Blood Bank (LNBB) collects units from a network of maternity wards since 1997 using the 'in utero' collection method both for vaginal deliveries and cesarean sections. Since 2015 the LNBB has updated the UCB databank to register mode of delivery of every UCB collection. Material (or patients) and methods: This analysis compares UCB obtained from 2855 vaginal deliveries and 146 caesarean sections (01/2015 -11/2015) . The volume of the collected cord blood was compared as well as quality parameters such as cell numbers (TNC) before processing and CD34+ cell content post-processing, by an independent Samples T-test. The level of significance was set for a p-value o 0.05. Results: Mean volume of UCB collected after cesarean section was significantly higher compared to UCB volumes collected after vaginal deliveries (Po 0.0001) (table 1). No statistically significant difference between quality markers such as cell count and CD34+ count (table 1) could be detected. Conclusion: Cord blood collection after cesarean route of delivery showed a larger collection volume than vaginal delivery. A possible explanation could be that, as the baby is placed above the placenta after the cesarean section, clamping the cord above the placenta possibly causes a downward flow of blood into the umbilical cord, which may result in a greater volume of UCB collected (Nunes & Zandavalli, 2015) .

Introduction: Cord blood (CB) is an alternative source for SCT in patients with haematological diseases. Criteria for CB banking lead to a huge discard of units. The Italian CBB Network, following the original idea of P.Rebulla and coll., is promoting a multicenter study to produce CB derivedplatelet gel (CB-PG) from units not eligible for unrelated transplantation (essentially due to low TNC count) for application in diabetic ulcers repair. In future this strategy will rescue unsuitable CB to a new clinical use and reduce the discard rate favorably impacting on CBBs activity. For this reason units with TNCs o 1x10 9 and PLT4150x10 9 /l underwent a two step-procedure to prepare PLT concentrates (CB-PCs) further activated to PGs by recalcification. First, a soft spin (200gx15min) is used to obtain platelet-rich plasma (PRP), then PRP is centrifuged at 2000gx15min to pellet PLTs and adjust PCs concentration to 800-1200x10 9 PLTs/l for conservation at -80\u00b0C. As CB units may be contaminated by a variety of environmental contaminants at time of collection, sterility testing is crucial for the safety of CB-PG products. The simplest approach is to test the final product (CB-PC), volume range 5-15 mL, despite very small specimens are available for inoculating culture vials. We previously demonstrated that PPP may represent an alternative specimen, even if a percentage of false negative results was noted especially for fungi. Material (or patients) and methods: Here we evaluated the mixture of the two discarded fractions (PPP and pRBC) as alternative specimen for seeding BD BACTEC Plus culture media, namely Anaerobic/F for anaerobes and Peds /F for aerobes (recommended seeded volume 10-8 and 3-1 ml, respectively). BD media were chosen because intended for testing aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and fungi and commonly available in standard laboratories. For this purpose, we inoculated fresh CBs with low bioburden (1CFU/ml) of the following microbial isolates tested in triplicates: E. coli and S. agalactiae (aerobic bacteria), B. fragilis and P. acnes (anaerobic bacteria), C. albicans and A. niger (fungi). Then CBs were processed according to CB-PG protocol. For anerobes 8, 1 and 0.5 ml of either PPP +pRBC or PCs were inoculated into Anaerobic/F vials, while for aerobes 1 and 0.5 ml of either PPP+pRBC or PCs were inoculated into Peds/F vials; incubation time: 30 days. Results: We evaluated the adequacy of sample, inoculum volume and BD media to detect the growth of aerobic/ anaerobic microrganisms in our setting. A minimal inoculum of 0.5 mL CPs was able to detect the growth of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria except for Propionibacterium (slow grower) whose growth was detectable by inoculating PPP +pRBC (limit volume: 1 mL). For the other strains PPP+pRBC inoculations with limit volume of 1 for aerobes and 0.5 ml for anaerobes demonstrated to be a suitable alternative sample. Conclusion: As CB-PC is a small volume product, the volume destined to quality controls is necessarily minimal. Here we demonstrated that in case of PPP+pRBC both sample and volume are adequate to detect major contaminants. A very tiny volume of PCs (0.5 mL) is also validated and is a critical step as a close system is still unavailable. Besides molecular methods able to minimize the seeding volume, our approach could be easily reproduced in contexts were such resources are not available. matched sibling donor, one with relapse post autologous SCT and 2 due to graft failure post matched unrelated transplantation).

Introduction: Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) from an haploidentical related donor is an alternative option for patients (pts) without a suitable HLA-matched related or unrelated donor, or for patients at a high-risk of disease progression. In Argentina the median time from the beginning of the search of an unrelated donor to the HCT is 5.4 months. The haplo HCT platform provides an opportunity for nearly all patients to benefit from HCT. Material (or patients) and methods: From January 2012 to June 2015, 97 pts with high-risk hematologic malignancies underwent T-cell replete haploidentical donor transplantation using posttransplant Cy (PT-Cy). Median follow-up: 6.6 months (CI 95% 4.5-8.8), Myeloablative (MAC)/reduce intensity conditioning regimen (RIC) 61 /36 pts, median age 35. 4 (5-70), female/male: 48/49. Patients underwent MAC HCT were older than RIC HCT: 30.9 vs 42.8 years-old (P = 0.001). 25.7% of the entire group received a previous transplant (MAC 18%, RIC 39%; P = 0.031), 37,1% were high-risk disease (\u22653CR, PR,PD,Ref), MAC 29.5%, RIC 50%; and 62,9% standard risk (CR1, CR2), MAC 43%, RIC 18% (P = 0.052). HCT-CI: 0-2/ \u2265 3: 87.5%/ 12.5%. MAC were 39% Bu-Flu-Cy, 20% Flu-TBI, 16% Bu-Flu, 10% Flu-Cy-TBI, 16% others) and RIC regimens (55% Flu-Cy-TBI, 11%Bu-Flu, 11%Bu-Flu-Cy, 5% Flu-Mel, 18% others. In MAC group 36% were ALL, 32% AML, 6.5% CML in BC. In RIC group 42% were AML, 16.6% ALL, 16.6% HD, 16.6% NHL, 5.5% MDS, 2.7% Multiple Myeloma. Graft source in MAC group was bone marrow (BM) 45%, Peripheral blood (PB) 44.3%, BM+PB 9.8%; in RIC group: BM 27.7% PB 72.3%, (P = 0.089). GVHD prophylaxis: PT-Cy-FK-MMF MA/RIC 88.5% /80.5% and 9.8% used Cs-A instead of FK 506 in both groups. Results: Non relapse mortality (NRM) cumulative incidence (CI) at 3 and 6 moths: 15.5% and 21.8%. 66% of NRM were attributed to infections. Relapse CI at 3 and 6 months: 6.5% and 14.7%. NRM according to HCT-CI: 0-2 = 53.6% vs \u2265 3 = 17.2% (P = 0.007). One-year overall survival (OS) was 42.9%; according HCT-CI at 1 year: 0-2 = 47.1% vs \u2265 3 = 14.1% (P = 0.001).

Secondary graft failure developed in 2 patients (MDS and HLH). GVHD was not registered in 70% of cases. In fact, acute GVHD was registered only in 5 patients, grade 1 skin in 2 patients, and grade 1 in remaining cases. Kaplan-Meier estimate of overall survival is 65% at median follow up of 2-years. Immune reconstitution was fast: leukocyte subpopulations levels were normalized in about 365 days after transplantation.

Introduction: CD26 is an ectoenzyme with dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) activity expressed on a variety of cell types and is known to contribute to T cell activation with well-defined modulatory effects on immune response. Evidence is mounting that CD26/DPP4 expression and enzymatic activity contribute to the emergence of autoimmune disease, immune-mediated abortions and transplant rejection. We had shown previously that, in autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT), the amount of CD26 ++ T cells contained in the autograft correlated with poor clinical outcome. In this study, CD26 ++ lymphocytes were investigated in patients who underwent first allogeneic haploidentical SCT. Material (or patients) and methods: To characterize CD26 ++ lymphocytes for future correlations with clinical outcome, especially chronic Graft versus Host Disease (cGvHD). Methods: Between January and October 2015, 10 eligible patients who underwent first allogeneic haploidentical SCT and their corresponding haploidentical donor were included in a prospective analysis. CD26 ++ lymphocytes were characterized by flow cytometry. Flow cytometric analyses were performed at defined timepoints prior to and during haploidentical transplantation. In addition, the serum concentrations and the enzymatic activity of sCD26/DPP4 were measured with commercially available enzyme-linked immunsorbent assay (ELISA) kits.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Variable"}, {"text": "Results: CD26 ++ lymphocytes were identified to have a unique phenotype (CD3 + , CD8 + , CD161 + , CD45RO + , CCR7 + ).

Conclusion: CD26 ++ lymphocytes define a unique set of T memory cells that have been postulated previously to possess chemoresistance and T-cell repopulating capacity. Given that Adenosine Deaminase (ADA) is anchored to T cells via CD26, the high density of CD26 is a critical prerequisite for chemoresistance, longevity and protection of a T cell population with obvious pathophysiological importance.

The incidence of TA-GVHD is uncertain. Diagnosis of TA-GVHD may be difficult. This disease is characterized by fever, rasch, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, pancytopenia and liver disfunction 2-30 days after transfusion. Mortality rate is very high. Death typically occur about 51 days after the transfusion. We describe a fatal case of TA-GVHD that occurred after transfusion of blood in a patient who has been treated for multiple myeloma. Material (or patients) and methods: Case report: In a 49 year old men patient (Pt), diagnosis of Myeloma Multiplex was established in 2008. Pt received six cycles of chemotherapy (VAD) prior to autologus SCT. The maintenance therapy was applied after transplantation. One year after the transplantation relapse occured and secondary SCT had been done in pt (in decembar 2009.). Posttransplanted autologous hematopoietic reconstitution was done timely. Two weeks after transfusion in patients occur fever, nausea,vomiting and diarrhea with normal biochemistry. Infection were excluded. Twenty-three days after transfusion on physical examination noted skin rash and patechie all over the body. His respiratory, cardiovascular and central nervous system examination was normal.

Introduction: Acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality following allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Treatment options for aGvHD are limited, frequently sub-optimal and often associated with considerable sideeffects. Corticosteroids (CCS) remain first-line therapy for aGvHD, however even in those who respond (SR-GvHD) ( o50%), therapy related morbidity including fungal infections or viral reactivation is high. Patients refractory to CCS (NR-GvHD) have limited subsequent treatment options and there is no clear consensus for their use. Moreover, responses are often inadequate and associated with significant complications. While the novel treatment strategies for aGvHD are costly, the indirect costs of aGvHD and the complications of current treatment strategies are less well delineated. Material (or patients) and methods: In the current economic climate with finite resources, we sought to objectively quantify the economic burden of aGvHD on our institution. We retrospectively analysed data for consecutive transplants over a 3-year period with respect to initial transplant bed stay and subsequent GvHD related re-admissions. We stratified groups by the presence or absence of aGvHD, as well as further analysing differences between SR and NR-GvHD. The costs of these differences were calculated. Results: Between January 2012 and December 2014 95 patients underwent allo-SCT within our institution from sibling (n = 43, 45%) or unrelated (n = 52, 55%) donors. The incidence of grade II-IV aGvHD was 47% (n = 45). 25 patients had SR-GvHD (27%) and 20 (21%) had NR-GvHD. In NR-GvHD patients the mean number of subsequent aGvHD treatments was 2 [range [1] [2] [3] [4] . Development of aGvHD was associated with a significantly longer transplant admission, mean stay 36 days in patients without GvHD vs 46 days in those with SR-GvHD (P = 0.03) and", "cite_spans": [{"start": 4862, "end": 4865, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4866, "end": 4869, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4870, "end": 4873, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4874, "end": 4877, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "AB29"}, {"text": "S575 50 days in those with NR-aGvHD (P = 0.003).

No differences were seen between SR and NR-GvHD, which is likely to reflect the higher death rates seen with NR-GvHD as a competing risk for admission. Utilising current hospital tariffs the additional hospital stay associated with aGvHD resulted in a mean excess cost of \u20ac44,637 and \u20ac46,968 for each SR-GvHD and NR-GvHD patient respectively culminating in an average annual institution cost of \u20ac688,980 from bed stay alone. Moreover, those with NR-GvHD had significantly more episodes of CMV reactivation (0.95 episodes) compared to no GvHD (0.32) (P = 0.01) or SR-GvHD (0.4) (P = 0.01). This is likely to further increase the economic burden of NR-GvHD and further cost analysis including antiviral, antifungal and diagnostic costs is underway. Conclusion: The additional cost burden of aGvHD is significant for the transplant community. Strategies for steroid reduction to achieve reduced hospital inpatient stays are crucial for patient morbidity and to achieve institutional financial stability.

Central venous access was required in 10/11(90.9%) patients. CBC results before and after LA were similar. In OPTIA group, the processed volume, the volume of the product, the percentage of loss of platelets, the amount of ACD used and the amount of ACD in the product, were significantly lower. The hemoglobin and the hematocrit were higher in the OPTIA group, and TMNC count was similar with both devices. Notably, TMNC CE was greatest in the OPTIA group.There were no differences in the duration of the procedure. Details are shown in Table 1 . The procedures were well tolerated with both devices, and only mild episodes of hypocalcemia were recorded in four procedures (two in OPTIA group, and two in COPE group). Conclusion: In our study, the Spectra OPTIA proved very effective and save in collecting MNC for ECP in GVHD.Because of this, we could consider shortening the time of collection with this device. The lower PL is very important because these patients often have low platelet counts. It also provides the advantage of being automatic and lower use of ACD what may reduce the hypocalcemia risk. The hemoglobin and the hematocrit were higher in the OPTIA group, but in the established limits for proper irradiation. Introduction: Transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA) represents a challenging and potential lifethreatening complication after alloHSCT. This syndrome occurs approximately in 10% to 20% of patients after alloHSCTs, 1 and it is characterized by inflammation, thrombotic microangiopathy, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and evidence of organ damage, particularly renal and neurological involvement. The mortality rate is approximately 30-80%. The treatment is problematic and no generally effective therapies are available. Therapeutic options consist in a wide range of treatment such as Plasma exchange (PEX) or immunosuppressive drugs, however lacking in high response rate due to the unclear TA-TMA pathophysiology. Recent data suggest that endothelial injury and complement activation could be involved in the pathogenesis of TA-TMA. Eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody against terminal complement, may be an innovative and effective therapeutic option for TA-TMA. Material (or patients) and methods: We report a case of TA-TMA in a recipient of alloHSCT for acute lymphoblastic leukemia B Ph negative. 34-year old male who underwent alloHSCT from unrelated donor 9/10 HLA compatible with total nucleated cells 10.54x10 8 /Kg and CD34+8.44x 10 6 /Kg.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 701, "end": 708, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "AB32"}, {"text": "Conditioning regimen consisted of TBI 1200 cGy and Cyclophosphamide 60 mg/Kg on days -3, -2.

Introduction: We have been using at our institution phototherapy -PUVA and UVBNB as skin direct therapy associated to ECP to treat different manifestations of cutaneous GVHD for the last 24 years. ECP is indicated to patients not responsive to steroids, those with IS toxicity or those who need early withdrawal of IS. Material (or patients) and methods: All patients treated with phototherapy since 1990 were prospectively evaluated in a single center institution. PUVA and UVBNB was performed with standard machine and UVA initial dose was based on skin type. ECP was performed with UVAR \u00ae photophresis system and liquid psoralen. PUVA and UVB-NB could also be combined with ECP for different clinical cutaneous manifestations or as ECP maintenance therapy. Complete response (CR) was defined as more than 75% of clinical response and partial response (PR) between 50% and 75%. Patients who had less than 30 phototherapy sessions were considered early for evaluation (EA). Results: Puvatherapy was used in 67 patients to treat lichen planus like and sclerodermic chronic GVHD with no visceral involvement. UVBNB was used in 25 patients for vitiligo, limited lichen planus like chronic GVHD, follicular keratosis, patients with psoralen oral intolerance and children. ECP was reserved to treat 43 patients with extensive sclerodermic, fasciitis cGVHD, systemic cGVHD and 13 patients with acute GVHD corticosteroid-refractory. Patients treated with ECP had more severe cGVHD (P o0,01). ECP was combined with PUVA in six patients and in UVBNB in 13. Conclusion: PUVA and UVBNB are topical direct therapies and should be considered in patients in whom long-term systemic IS is antecipated. Phototherapy as topical therapy on the skin associated with ECP helps in the treatment of sclerotic cGVHD extensive and vitiligo that are often seen in the same patient. This study shows encouraging results and suggests that phototherapy treatment results in more rapid reduction of immunosuppression. Introduction: Chronic graft versus host disease (cGvHD) is major predictor of long term survival after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Similarities with autoimmune diseases are due to B lymphocyte (B-Ly) dysregulation and thus abnormal production of various auto antibodies (Ab). Using of chimeric monoclonal anti CD20 antibody (Rituximab) is based on their \"in vivo depletion\" of B-Ly and thus we estimate efficacy and safety of Rituximab in the therapy of refractory severe cGvHD. Material (or patients) and methods: Seven patients, M/F 5/2, have received Rituximab after failure to standard treatment (Methylprednisolone, Cyclosporine A, Mycophenolate mofetil, Azathioprim, PUVA\u2026). Median age was 29 years (18-49). All of them have received HLA identical sibling transplant with stem cells from peripheral blood in 5 and bone marrow in 2 cases. Despite standard prophylaxis, 4 of them had acute GvHD", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "AB32"}, {"text": "S578 grade 1-2 and all of them had severe cGvHD with lichenoid, sclerodermic or pemphigoid skin feature, buccal mucosa involvement with sicca syndrome. Extracutaneous manifestation included lung in 4, liver in 4 and thrombocytopenia in 3 cases. One patient had CMV infection prior to exacerbation of cGvHD. We applied Rituximab in usually recommended regimen (375 mg/m 2 weekly for 4 weeks). Results: Exact responses were measured with Schirmer test, spirometry, liver function parameters and hematological findings. Good effect was observed in 5 patients (71,4%) even after first application. Best results were achieved concerning mucosa (significant reducing of sicca syndrome) and skin (improvement of turgor, lichenoid changes and pemphigoid reconstitution). Lung and liver function were improved as well, but it should be mentioned that other immunosuppressant were also given (particularly Mycophenolate mofetil and Azathioprim). Three patients had severe infectious complication, two of them have died from sepsis, and one of them have developed abscesses pulmonalis in fourth week of treatment. Conclusion: Results from our modest data suggests that monoclonal anti CD20 antibody in the treatment of severe refractory cGvHD is encouraging but needs further investigation. Disclosure of Interest: None declared. Introduction: Human herpesviruses (HHVs) are commonly found in general population but also in patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) where they may cause severe complications. Particularly, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection was significantly more frequent among adults and was associated with a higher risk of developing acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) (1) (2) (3) . Therefore, the aim of our study was to determine prevalence of particular HHVs in patients with oral chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) and possible role in these patients. Material (or patients) and methods: This pilot study enrolled 36 cGvHD patients who are part of a larger multidisciplinary cGvHD project at the University Hospital Center Zagreb, Croatia. Patients were evaluated for clinical and cGvHD characteristics; severity of cGvHD and oral involvement were determined by using established NIH Consensus criteria. Cytobrush swabs from oral mucosa were collected from all patients. Specimens were analyzed by specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of several HHVs (CMV, Epstein-Barr virus -EBV, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, and varicella zoster virus -VZV). Data were evaluated descriptively and Chi-square test was used to calculate statistical significance. Results: 36 cGVHD patient were enrolled, of which 18 men (average age 37.8) and 18 women (average age 40.9).Twenty patients had diagnostic signs of oral cGvHD (55.6%), 13 were (36.1%) without, and 3 (8.3%) had distinctive signs of oral cGvHD. Overall, in 18 of 36 patients (50%) no HHVs were identified, 3/36 (8.33%) had CMV, 13/36 (36.11%) had EBV, 2/33 (6.06%) VZV and no HSV 1 and 2 were found, respectively. EBV was statistically significantly found more often than the second most common CMV (P = 0.0046). There was no statistically significant difference in HHVs between patients with and those without oral cGvHD.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1712, "end": 1715, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1716, "end": 1719, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1720, "end": 1723, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "References"}, {"text": "Conclusion: Although proportion of patients with cGvHD, especially patients with oral cGvHD was EBV positive, indicating the possibility that EBV is more common in chronic GVHD, further studies with control groups are necessary to determine the role of EBV in cGVHD. Our preliminary data also indicate that the use of molecular methods to determine the presence of HHVs is valuable method in the follow-up of cGvHD patient particularly by using oral cytobrush specimens for PCR analysis as less invasive alternative method for monitoring these patients. Introduction: Bleeding complications and Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD) are severe complications in hematooncological patients and patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation (HSCT). A systematic and prospective assessment of these complications is essential in order to evaluate therapeutic interventions, optimize patient care and thus improve patient outcome. Different bleeding scores to be used in clinical practice but also for research purposes have been developed, including the WHO and BSMS scores. 1, 2 Recently, the National Institute of Health (NIH) updated their recommendations for diagnosis and staging of GVHD. 3 For the prospective and systematic evaluation of bleeding complications and GVHD, we developed an electronic tool with the aim to improve patient care and for clinical research purposes. Material (or patients) and methods: In collaboration with IT-specialists we developed a browser based electronic tool for assessment of bleeding and GVHD according to the published guidelines. This tool (bleedHD) works on different devices and thus allows efficient bedside assessment. Collected data include patient's and disease characteristics, type of intervention, type and site of bleeding as well as GVHD features, according to the published guidelines. Results: bleedHD is a secured browser based, user-friendly tool and was improved over time and validated on a large number of patients. The current available tool allows easy collection of patient characteristics including names, date of birth, gender, age, diagnosis and interventions (type of transplantation and stem cell source). Thereafter, the assessor can choose between assessment of bleeding (either WHO or BSMS or both) or GVHD or both. According to the published NIH guidelines, GVHD can be scored in case of first diagnosis, by every single organ (organ scoring), by activity assessment and finally by self-reporting by the patient himself. The user will be guided step-by-step through the different scoring systems. Assessments can be interrupted at any time and resumed later. bleedHD automatically gives an overview over time and scores S579 of each patient. During assessment, explanations, additional information and pictures can be retrieved allowing correct assessment also for not experienced users. All the data are safely stored on an appropriate server. Complete data can be exported as CVS file for further analysis and research purposes. In our experience bleedHD significantly improves the accuracy of bleeding and GVHD assessment in an easy, fast and straightforward approach. Scoring patients became much more convenient and easy. Additionally it allows a prospective bedside assessment and clear demonstration of clinical changes in case of therapeutic interventions. Physicians and nurses from other institutions, which are involved in patient care can have access to bleedHD and also assess GVHD during follow-up. Conclusion: bleedHD is an innovative and easy tool for an accurate, efficient and prospective assessment of bleeding complications and GVHD in hemato-oncological patients. This can improve patient care and outcome. Additionally, it can be a useful tool for clinical research in the therapy of GVHD and to further investigate the efficacy of platelet transfusions or other interventions in thrombocytopenic patients. Introduction: Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is a lifethreatening complication of allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which has a wide range of pleomorphic manifestations at multiple organs. Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is an immunomodulatory therapy that provides encouraging results in skin GVHD but also in multiorganic involvement (skin, gut and liver). The ECP reverses GVHD through the reduction in response of donor effector T cells and production of donor Tregs. Material (or patients) and methods: We retrospectively analyzed 24 patients with refractory acute and chronic GVHD treated in our center with ECP from September 2009 to October 2015. The median age was 16 (range 2-61), the main primary disease was acute myeloid leukemia. There were 12 patients with aGVHD that were classified according to the degree of severity in grade II and III 67% and grade IV 33%, 12 patients with cGHVD patients were classified according the global scoring of NIH consensus into moderate 75% and severe 25%. Skin was the organ mostly involved (79%), while 37% of patients had multiorgan involvement. ECP was performed using the online system THERAKOS, and the off line system using the Spectra Optia separator, and the UVA device MACOPHARMA. Patients with aGVHD received 2-3 consecutive days of ECP at weekly intervals until response and then tapered to every 2 to 4 weeks, patients with cGVHD received 2 consecutive sessions at 2 week intervals. Results: The Overall response rate (ORR) for aGVHD and cGVHD was 75% and 91% respectively. The ORR for patients with aGVHD grade II-III was 100% and grade IV was 25%. In moderate and severe cGVHD the ORR was 66 and 100% respectively. We analyzed organ specific complete response (CR) rates in patients with aGVHD and cGVHD (graphic 1), in skin involvement CR was achieved in 78% and 72% (aGVHD and cGVHD), in multiorganic involvement (skin, liver and gut) the CR was 50% and 67% respectively. Seven patients died, the main cause of death was infectious disease. The procedure was well tolerated, only NCI grade I adverse events were observed.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1067, "end": 1069, "text": "1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1070, "end": 1071, "text": "2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1186, "end": 1187, "text": "3", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "References"}, {"text": "Conclusion: In our experience the use of ECP for aGVHD, had favorable rates of response especially at early stages. There is tendency for higher responses in aGVHD with cutaneous involvement. We observed significant rates of responses in moderate and severe cGVHD. We found that ECP has a considerable activity against multiorganic cGVHD. The early intervention with ECP improves the poor outcome of patients with steroid refractory GVHD. Introduction: After autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) it exists a period of time with an increased risk of infectious diseases because of immune dysfunction. For this reason, it is advisable to administer several vaccines beginning 6-12 months after transplantation. In our hospital, the haematologist responsible for posttransplant monitoring establishes the prescription of vaccination, both the dates and the number of doses, including vaccines against Stp. Pneumoniae, H. inluenzae type b, C. tetani, C. diphtheria, Poliovirus and Influenzavirus. After this, patients are sent to the Primary Care Trust (PCT) where the general practitioner is responsible for the correct completion of the set prescription, indicating the administration to the nursing unit. Material (or patients) and methods: The aims of the current study are: a) to assess treatment adherence to the vaccination schedule elaborated in our unit and determine reasons for lacking of adherence, if this is the case; b) to identify administrative problems (lack of vaccines, absence of collaboration between the general practitioner and the haematologist responsible, etc.); c) to describe adverse reactions related to vaccines (fever, rash, etc.). Methods: Descriptive and retrospective study of patients who underwent autologous stem cell transplantation in our hospital from May 2008 to October 2013, so it has been possible to complete the vacunal schedule. Information was obtained by telephone interviews and reviewing medical histories. Patients were questioned about: a) the administration of every prescribed vaccine; b) reasons why vaccines were not administered, if this occurred; c) administrative problems in obtaining them; d)administration of additional vaccines not prescribed by the haematologist; d) local and systemic adverse reactions after vaccine administration. Results: 58 transplanted patients (34 male, 24 female) with a median age of 51.5 years, diagnosed of Multiple Myeloma 24 (41.4%), Hodgkin Lymphoma 10 (17.2%), NHL-B 18 (31%), NHL-T 3 (5.2%), Acute Leukaemia 2 (3.4%), Plasmatic Cell Leukemia 1 (1.7%). Of these, 51 (88%) patients answered the questionnaire and 7 (12%) were unable to be contacted due to exitus or change in hospital. Of those who completed the questionnaire, 42 (82.3%) recieved all the prescribed vaccines by the haematologist, 7 patients reported having problems with availability. From 9 (17.6%) patients who have not been administered any vaccines, 6 of them were for haematologist indication (due to progression of disease), and 3 obey to patient refusal. From all vaccinated patients, only 2 (4.8%) were given an additional vaccine, not included in the original calendar (Influenza A). From those vaccinated, 7 (16.7%) reported any of the following adverse reactions: fever (4), asthenia (1), flu-like symptoms (1), and local skin reaction (1) . Conclusion: In our hospital unit, even though there were a relatively small number of patients, the degree of adherence observed was quite high and without any relevant incidence. We consider that collaboration with the Primary Care Trust in the administration of the post-transplant vaccination schedule has an important role when treating and caring for our patients.

Introduction: It has been reported that reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) could be fatal in patients with malignancy following systemic immunosuppressive chemotherapy, especially combined with rituximab, or hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Many guidelines regarding HBV reactivation following chemotherapy recommends that HB surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to HB core antibody (anti-HBc), and antibody to HB surface antibody (anti-HBs) should be tested before the chemotherapy is initiated. Japanese guideline for HBV infection in whom received chemotherapy was published in 2009; however it remains a few cases reported who developed fulminant hepatitis from HBV reactivation following chemotherapy. This fact implies that the guideline is not properly observed. Therefore we conducted this study to evaluate whether HBV screening tests before HCT were employed according to the guideline in the HBV-endemic region of Japan. Material (or patients) and methods: We retrospectively analyzed 127 patients who were treated with allo-or auto-HCT between 2006 and 2014 at Kansai Medical University Hospital. Results: A total of 127 patients were studied. 43 patients underwent allo-HCT and 84 patients underwent auto-HCT. All patients were examined on HBsAg before the HCT. 2 patients (1.5%) were proved to be HBsAg positive carrier, who received nucleoside analog against HBV thereafter. Only 5 patients (3.9%) were investigated neither on HBcAb or HBsAb. Although 25 patients (19.6%) were seropositive either for HBcAb or HBsAb, 19 patients (76%) among them were not examined on HBV-DNA as follow-up. Fortunately no fulminant hepatitis was experienced, 2 patients developed late-onset reactivation. These 2 were patients who underwent auto-HCT. One was a HBV carrier who had received prophylactic nucleoside analog during the whole course of therapy, whose HBV-DNA level resulted in undetected. She developed reactivation of HBV with long interval after auto-HCT. The other had occult infection of HBV, who converted to late-onset reactivation after auto-HCT. Neither of them developed hepatitis after they were retreated with nucleoside analog against HBV. Conclusion: Improvement was achieved by the guideline on management against HBV reactivation following chemotherapy. While it did not pervade perfectly even in the HBVendemic region of Japan. Most hematologists would recognize how important to examine the HBV serostatus before the HCT; however they are afraid to lose the following blood test regarding HBV. The guideline might be complicated to observe the follow-up study from the point of view. Thus, the guideline is preferable to be simplified and the institutional surveillance should be established to encourage the follow-up study. If other medical staff composed of nurses, pharmacologists, and laboratory technicians as well as hematologists, is aware of HBV serostatus of the patient during the entire course of chemotherapy, it could be attributable to prevent from missing the follow-up study. Introduction: Citomegalovirus meningoencephalitis is a rare and fatal complication after allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation. We describe a paediatric patient who developed the infection one year after cord blood transplantation although preemptive treatment and good control of blood viremia. Material (or patients) and methods: A 15-year-old male patient with Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia in third complete remission received an unrelated 5/6 HLA matched single umbilical cord blood transplant. The patient and the donor (maternal IgG serostatus) were CMV-seropositive. The conditioning regimen was based on fludarabine, thiotepa, busulfan and anti-thymocyte globulin. Cyclosporine and a short course (14 days) of prednisone were given as GVHD prophylaxis. Because of acute grade II GVHD (gut) patient received two courses of prednisone 2 mg/Kg/day and oral budesonide starting on day +7 and +105, respectively. Cyclosporine discontinuation started on day +205. Intravenous Ig was administered monthly. The patient showed good engraftment and total donor chimerism although with a poor immune reconstitution (persistent low CD4 count) implying frequent CMV asymptomatic viremia. Complete molecular remission was maintained. Results: On day +300 the patient started with apathy, memory lost, language deficit and lethargy. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed signs compatible with meningitis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3329, "end": 3332, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5161, "end": 5167, "text": "(3.9%)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "References"}, {"text": "Cytomegalovirus was detected by quantitative PCR technique in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (23.000 UI/ml) whereas it was negative in blood.

He was admitted to the paediatric BMT Unit to start double intravenous antiviral treatment based on ganciclovir and foscarnet. Cyclosporine was discontinued in one week. A progressive neurological worsening was seen during the next two months although negativity of CMV in CSF was achieved. The patient died on day +375.

Our patient experienced the fatal infection although effectiveness of preemptive antiviral treatment to clear blood viremia. Disclosure of Interest: None declared. A 26 year-old male patient with SAA was admitted with fever, periorbital swelling, periorbital pain, and bloody nasal discharge. The patient had been diagnosed with SAA. Computed tomography of the paranasal sinuses demonstrated a space-occupying lesion in the right maxillary and ethmoid sinus region. Histopathologic examination revealed numerous PAS-stained Aspergillus hyphae without tissue invasion. Tissue culture revealed Aspergillus fumigatus. Voriconazole administration was started. Case 2. A 24-year-old male patient was admitted to our clinic due to pancytopenia. The patient was diagnosed with SAA and allogeneic HSCT was planned. However he had fever on day 3 of admission. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis was suggested based on the presence of pneumonic consolidations on CT of the thorax and galactomannan positivity (1.18 index). Liposomal amphotericin B was started in therapeutical dose. Results: Invasive fungal infections (IFI), particularly those caused by Aspergillus species, have long been recognised as a major cause of death in SAA. Mortality rate is still high in SAA patients with IFI despite antifungal therapy and even granulocyte infusion plus G-CSF administration. A condition in which the response to immunosupressive therapy can take up to 6 months to develop leading to a neutropenic period that is typically longer than that seen after HSCT. HSCT with active IFI places the patient at a higher risk for transplant related mortality. However, HSCT without delay is only curative treatment approach in some patients. We performed HSCT under antifungal therapy in both patients. Both patients overcame the neutropenic period and they were discharged without severe morbidity. Conclusion: We conclude that an immediate HSCT may be life-saving and G-CSF plus granulocyte transfusion may be used as a bridge to HSCT in patients who do not satisfactorily respond to antifungal therapy although there are scarce data about the HSCT in SAA patients with active invasive fungal infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "S581"}, {"text": "R- Results: This presentation focuses on the recently updated oral care guidance which is based on the most recent evidence, clinician feedback and expert opinion.The guidance continues to focus on the key principles of; an accurate assessment of the oral cavity, identification of risk factors, regular care, earlier intervention to prevent/reduce oral damage and the correct treatment interventions.

A few cases of successful pregnancies after autologous or allogeneic transplants, have been recently reported but, to our knowledge, none after cord blood transplantation (CBT). We report the case of a young woman who successfully carried out a pregnancy with a donated oocyte, 7 years after a TBI-including myeloablative CBT. Material (or patients) and methods: Our patient, a 27-year old woman, was diagnosed of pro-B acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in August 2006. She was treated with a national high-risk ALL protocol (PETHEMA HR-ALL 2003), with persistence of disease after induction. First complete remission was achieved after the fourth consolidation. An allogeneic CBT was performed in March 2007. The CB unit was co-infused with haploidentical selected CD34+ SC from an unrelated donor. Conditioning was myeloablative and included fractionated TBI (total dose 1000 cGy), fludarabine 120 mg/m 2 (30 mg/m2, days -5 to -2), cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg (60 mg/kg, days -4 and -3) and thymoglobulin 4 mg/kg (2 mg/kg, days -2 and -1).

HSCT is associated with considerable morbimortality due to factors like recurrence of underlying disease, HLA compatibility between donor and recipient and type conditioning regime. This study investigated the association between human neutrophil alloantigens (HNA) and engraftment, the occurrence of acute GVHD and transplant related mortality in patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at our center. Introduction: Cardiac failure is a known complication after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), but predominantly occurs in predisposed patients with low output fractions or valvular heart disease. Hereby, we present a case of acute Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in a patient without preexisting cardiac comorbidities resulting in cardiogenic shock and ventilator therapy on day +1 after allogeneic HSCT.

Bridging therapy to HSCT with 5 cycles of decitabine was performed with no signs of AML recurrence. Apart from mild hypertension treated with beta blockers and AT1 antagonists, the patient had no history of cardiopulmonary disease. After reduced-toxicity conditioning therapy with treosulfan, fludarabine and ATG, the patient received 6,9 x 10e6 CD34 positive cells per kg bw from an HLA 10/10 matched unrelated male donor without any acute distress during re-transfusion of stem cells. However, eleven hours after transplant, she complained of acute chest pain, hypotension and dyspnea with decreased oxygen saturation that was refractory to non-invasive ventilation and was immediately transferred to the ICU in cardiogenic shock. Results: The ECG showed a heart rate of 136/min and an R-peak reduction from V1 to V3 without ST segment changes. High sensitive troponine, brain natriuretic peptide and creatinine kinase were elevated, but there were no signs of hemolysis. Coronary angiography was performed immediately after intubation. On examination there were no signs of coronary artery disease, but ventriculography and subsequent echocardiography revealed severe hypokinesia of the apical and medial walls (output fraction 30%) consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

Introduction: Patients frequently cite nausea and vomiting as one of the most distressing and debilitating side effects of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) can be divided into acute (24 or fewer hours after chemotherapy), delayed (more than 24 hours after chemotherapy). This distinction is made because acute CINV is believed to be mediated through serotonin receptor stimulation while delayed CINV is thought to involve multiple neurotransmitters, including opioid and neurokinin receptors. Chemotherapeutic agents have variable emetogenic potential that is affected by dose and method of administration. High-dose chemotherapy (HDC), often combined with TBI or total nodal irradiation of a varied amount, and stem cell rescue is a treatment modality applied to a wide variety of medical conditions. The delivery of high-dose therapy is almost always associated with a great degree of nausea and vomiting. Material (or patients) and methods: A clinical study of triple drugs combination (aprepitant+palonosetron+dexamethasone) was carried out to evaluate its efficacy in preventing both acute and delayed emesis after high-dose chemotherapy ( Historical control groups of patients were treated with dexamethasone (dex) and palonosetron. The observation period started with the initiation of chemotherapy (0 h) and continued for 24 h after completion of the chemotherapy for acute phase, and during five days after finishing chemotherapy for delayed phase. The response rate of the study drugs was evaluated by the following 4-grade scale based on the condition of nausea and vomiting: highly, moderately or slightly effective and not effective. Results: The best results were observed (triple drugs combination) in the early phase after BEAM conditioning and in delayed phase after Mel200 high-dose chemotherapy. Conclusion: Triple drugs combination was more effective than palonosetron (+ dex) treatment in preventing CINV after high-dose chemotherapy before haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Introduction: Chylothorax is lymphatic fluid leakage into pleural space with high triglyceride content and milky appearance. Etiology could be congenital, trauma, malignancy or granulomatous infections. This report describes multifactorial etiology of bilateral chylothorax in a child after stem cell transplantation (SCT). Material (or patients) and methods: A 16 years old male with monosomy 7 positive refractory AML had undergone SCT from a matched related donor with total body irradiation based conditioning and secondary prophylaxis with voriconazole. Results: At 3 months posttransplant with 100% donor chimerism and monosomy negativity he had dysphagia, vomiting, anal pain and fever which prompted ampirical antibiotics. On the second day facial angioedemateous like swelling, resistant to steroids and antihistaminics was noticed with no sign of extramedullary relapse in paranasal and neck CT. On the 7th day he developed diarrhea. Although rectal biopsy proved severe intestinal GVHD no therapy was given as diarrhea resolved. Fifteen days later liver function tests increased and biopsy verified GVHD that lead to tacrolimus and steroid treatment. While performing liver biopsy milky appearing fluid was noticed. Abdominal US showed perihepatic fluid (6 mm). Invasive aspergillosis history and newly developed cough directed a thorax CT which displayed bilateral pleural (20mm in left, 24 mm in right) effusion and 5mm cavitary lesion in the left lung. Thoracocentesis drained chylohemorrhagic fluid with a triglyceride content of 1150 mg/dl and galactomannan and aspergillus PCR positivity. Central venous line was removed for leakage suspicion. As new lesions under voriconazole have emerged, liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB) and fatrestricted oral diet and ocreotide were started. In the meantime although morphologically in remission monosomy 7 positivity was detected that encouraged tacrolimus withdrawal. At 1st month of ocreotide and L-AMB treatment he developed fever with increased coughing. Thorax CT showed ground glass appearance and enlarged effusion (52 mm left, 13mm right). Inflammatory fluid was drained and caspofungin was added to L-AMB along with wide spectrum antibiotics. No microorganism was detected in further tests. Besides ocreotide he had TPN nil by mouth for 10 days which caused decrease in pleural effusions (12 mm left, 7mm right). He received combined antifungal therapy for 8 weeks with resolution of the lesions. Repeated bone marrow examinations showed remission and monosomy negativity. He is now well at 16th months posttransplant with minimal pleural effusion receiving ocreotide and cyclosporine for upper GI GVHD. Conclusion: Chylothorax is an uncommon cause of pleural effusion in children. As treatment should be based on determining the underlying cause, it is of paramount importance to define the etiology. In the absence of apparent risk factors such as trauma this could be difficult. That is particularly challenging in the transplant setting since the etiology could be multifactorial as in our patient. Although the beginning was chylous ascites the bilateral nature of chylothorax precluded us from considering it being the origin. We assume that the reason of bilateral chylothorax in our patient is iatrogenic trauma by TBI as well as noniatrogenic trauma by forceful emesis and coughing associated with GVHD and aspergillus infection where all could be common in the posttransplant setting.

Introduction: Allogeneic transplantation (Allo-SCT) in multiple myeloma is controversial mainly due to the relatively high non-relapse mortality (NRM). Treosulfan is a prodrug of a bifunctional alkylating agent which has both myelotoxic and immunosuppressive properties (1) . Recently a regimen of moderate dose treosulfan has been used in combination with fludarabine and ATG for treatment of malignant lymphoma and a small number of patients with multiple myeloma with low transplant related mortality (2, 3) . The aim with this retrospective single-center study was to evaluate recent transplants particularly after conditioning with treosulfan plus fludarabine (TreoFlu). Material (or patients) and methods: The study comprised 39 patients (median age: 46 years) that underwent Allo-SCT between 2000 and 2015. Twenty-five patients were in very good partial response or better (\u2265 VGPR) and 14 in less than VGPR. Results: The 3 years overall survival (OS) for the patients allografted after and before year 2008 was 89% vs 41% respectively (HR = 0.14 (95% CI 0.03-0.65, P = 0.01) and for patients transplanted in \u2265 VGPR and P = 0.18 Introduction: Prognosis of relapse of hematologic malignancy after allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains dismal. Second allogeneic transplantation represents a valid clinical option in such patients. Toxicity of the preparative regimen for second transplanation may sometimes limit a decision making process in offering the patients a second graft. Goal was to evaluate the toxicity and tolerability of treosulfan, fludarabine and rabbit ATG (Thymoglobuline, r-TG) preparative regimen in the setting of the second allogeneic stem cell transplantation for disease relapse. Material (or patients) and methods: We evaluated all patients who underwent second allogeneic transplantation for the relapse of their malignant disorder after the first allograft during years 2012-2015 at our department. Preparative regimen in all patients consisted of treosulfan 12 g/m2 for 3 days, fludarabine 30 mg/m2 for 5 days and r-TG 6 mg/kg. All patients received calcineurin inhibitor and mycophenolate mofetil as GVHD prophylaxis. Day +28 and +100 mortality, platelet and neutrophil engraftment as well as infectious and acute non-infectious complications were recorded. Results: We identified 9 patients (8 males and 1 female), median age 47 years (33-65 years) who underwent second allogeneic graft for relapsed disease after the 1st transplantation. 5 patients had acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome, 2 patients had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 1 had chronic lymphocytic leukemia and 1 primary myelofibrosis. 3 patient were in subsequent CR of the disease and 6 in relapse. 7 patients received 10/10 matched unrelated peripheral blood stem cell graft and 2 patients received 9/10 mismatched unrelated peripheral blood stem cell graft. All patients engrafted in platelets at median D+13 (9-26) and in neutrophils at median D+14 (11-20). Median D+28 donor chimerism was 100% (5-100%), one patient experienced graft failure at D+28 due to HHV-6 and subsequently died of HHV-6 encephalitis (confirmed). No other early deaths until D+100 were observed. Only 2 patients had mucositis, only one being grade 4. All 9 patients experienced episode of fever, 5 of them diagnosed with G-bloodstream infection and 2 of them with G + blodstream infection. 2 patients had pneumonia. All patients recovered from their respective complications. Overall D+100 non-relapse mortality was 11.1% (1/9 patients). Conclusion: Treosulfan, fludarabine and r-TG is feasible option in the conditioning of relapsed patients undergoing the second allograft. Sunstained engraftment and acceptable early non-relapse mortality warrant its use in the setting of second transplant. Infection remains the biggest challenge in this setting.

Results: after fractioned splenic irradiation and fludarabinebased conditioning regimen, all pts showed remarcable spleen volume reduction within two months after HSCT; 5/6 pts obtained successful donor cells engraftment, without severe complication related to splenic irradiation. Median neuthrophil and platelet recovery (4500/mm 3 and 420.000/mm 3 ) was 27 and 36 days respectively. After 2 months, chimerism status was 100% donor for 4 pts and 80% donor for 1 patient.

Introduction: In Europe rabbit Anti-Thimocyte-Globuline (ATG) is widely employed in patients submitted to Matched Unrelated Donor (MUD) Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) in order to reduce acute and chronic Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD). ATG seems to be very effective in reducing GvHD, but a significant increase of infective complications is often observed in these patients (pts). This fact and the reduction of \"Graft versus Leukemia\" effect make the use of ATG in MUD-HSCT a matter of debate nowadays. We evaluated the immunologic recovery in pts treated with ATG during the first year after MUD-HSCT and its correlation with the insurgence of opportunistic infection in the same period, excluding infection appeared before hematological uptake. Material (or patients) and methods: We considered 32 pts, affected by hematological malignancies, submitted to MUD-HSCT who received ATG 7.5 mg/Kg during the conditioning regimen. We discriminated two categories: pts who developed opportunistic infection (12 pts) and pts without infection (20 pts) in the first year after HSCT.

B and NK cells and T4/T8 ratio are lower in these pts for all the period, although the statistical significance is not reached due to the limited number of pts. Conclusion: Pts who receive ATG have a higher susceptibility to infections respect to pts who do not. Pts with infections have a slower immunological recovery than expected. We can conclude that pts who receive ATG during the conditioning regimen should be strictly monitored for immunological recovery and for infection insurgence. The real role of ATG in this prolonged immunological recovery remain to be defined. Disclosure of Interest: None declared. from MUD (56,5%) and 12 from MMFD (8,7%). Stem cell sources included bone marrow (n = 97), peripheral blood (n = 87) and cord blood (n = 1 Introduction: As the survival of allo-HSCTs is constantly improving, more and more patients, especially the youngest, are susceptible to late complications. Here, we present our institutional experience of late effects in the first 6 years (y) following pediatric allo-HSCT, comparing malignant versus non-malignant indications for HSCT. Material (or patients) and methods: All children allotransplanted between 2009 and 2015 were included in this single-center retrospective cohort. Screening was carried out in accordance with international published guidelines. 1 Of 76 transplanted patients, 58 were included in the analysis; 18 excluded due to short (o6 months) follow-up. Results: Median age at HSCT was 9.8y; the non-malignant group was younger. HSCT indications were evenly divided between non-malignant (NMD) and malignant diseases (MD) (82% of which were ALL). Ten patients (17%) required a 2 nd HSCT. Pre-transplant characteristics are listed in table 1. Median follow-up was 3.3y. Twenty one patients (36%) had cGVHD; the rate of cGVHD was double in patients with MD, and all 5 severe cGVHD cases occurred in this group. The common affected organs were skin & joints, GI tract, lungs, [AB67]", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1932, "end": 1933, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "AB65"}, {"text": "eyes & liver. Late complications included hormonal dysfunction in 13 patients (22%); 80% of gonadal insufficiency cases were in females. More than half (57%) had vitamin D deficiency. Other involved systems included: cardiac (9%), pulmonary (7%), and skeletal (osteoporosis & avascular necrosis -7%). The risk of late complications was not increased following 2 nd HSCT (30 vs. 35%), although cGVHD incidence was higher (50 vs. 36%). Seven patients with MD died during the follow-up period compared to 1 case in the NMD group. See table 1 for transplant related morbidity and mortality. Conclusion: These data confirm that even in the first years following allo-HSCTs, pediatric patients are prone to a diverse array of complications, mainly endocrine. The underlying disease appears to affect morbidity: children with MD have a two-fold risk of developing cGVHD and late effects (other than vitamin D deficiency), versus NMD. These differences could be attributed to higher cumulative induction/conditioning radio-chemotherapy dose in the MD group. Although the vast majority of deaths were in patients with MD, most deaths were attributed to disease relapse; therefore no conclusion can be drawn regarding late transplant related mortality in MD versus NMD. Study limitations include the relatively small cohort, loss to follow-up and uncertainty regarding patient adherence to screening guidelines.

Three children with x-linked chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), one patient with Griscelli syndrome type 2 and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and two other twins with IL-7 receptor deficient T -B + NK + severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) were transplanted from matched related or unrelated donors at our Center between 2008-2014. All three patients with CGD received myeloablative regimens and the grafts were bone marrow in two and peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) in one of the patients. The patient with Griscelli received also a myeloablative regimen and PBSC.The two SCID's had a non-myeloablative conditioning and were transplanted with bone marrow simultaneously. Results: All of the patients engrafted, presenting complete donor chimerism early after the transplant. Regarding transplant specific complications, two patients presented acute graft versus host disease and the child with HLH developed severe veno-occlusive disease early after the transplant. Two out of the three patients with CGD are cured, the third died following severe pneumonia at 3 months posttransplant with 100% donor chimerism and normal function of granulocytes and monocytes. One of the twins with SCID is well with 100% donor chimerism and good immune reconstitution, the other one died of pulmonary complications, whereas the patient with HLH is also in remission, with a mixed chimerism. Overall, four of six patients are alive and well with complete recovery of their severe immune deficiency. Eleven patients developed acute GVHD (grade 1-2) and 3 of them went on to develop chronic GVHD; all successfully managed with steroids and a combination of tacrolimus, cyclosporine and mycophenolate. Interesting to note was that 5 out of the 6 patients with HLH/ LPD developed engraftment syndrome/ cytokine release syndrome. Of note there was a high incidence of graft failures with 7 primary and 6 secondary graft failures. Conclusion: In the absence of a matched sibling and matched unrelated donor, haploidentical parental stem cells are more readily utilized especially when the disease progression is rapid and a transplant is urgent. With improved techniques in stem cell manipulation haploidentical parental tranplatation offers a cure for these patients. However more work needs to be done in evaluating the engraftment and immune reconstituition in these patients. Introduction: Non-relapse mortality following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has rapidly decreased during the past 15 years among pediatric cancer patients in developed countries, but little information about non-relapse or relapse-related mortality is available for pediatric cancer patients in developing countries. We aimed to estimate the cumulative incidence of non-relapse and relapse-related mortality following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation among pediatric cancer patients in Argentina. Material (or patients) and methods: Individuals eligible for our study were aged o20 years when diagnosed with cancer and underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation between September 1, 1998 and May 31, 2015 at Hospital de Ninos Sor Marlia Ludovica in La Plata, Argentina, which is a regional referral center for pediatric transplantation. Our outcomes of interest were non-relapse and relapse-related mortality, where non-relapse mortality was defined as mortality from any cause other than cancer progression. These outcomes were prospectively documented following transplantation until July 31, 2015. We used a competing-risks framework to estimate cumulative incidence and 95% confidence limits (CL) of nonrelapse mortality and relapse-related mortality. Results: Our study population comprised 89 pediatric cancer patients, of whom 44% were aged o10 years at transplantation, 63% were male, 90% were diagnosed with leukemia, and 92% were transplanted with stem cells from related donors. We observed 39 deaths (24 relapse-related and 15 nonrelapse) during 280 person-years of follow-up (median = 3.6 years, interquartile range = 1. 2-8.4 ). Infections or infectionrelated consequences were the most common causes of nonrelapse mortality (40% of non-relapse deaths). The 5-year cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality was 18% (95% CL: 10%, 26%) and the 5-year cumulative incidence of relapserelated mortality was 31% (95% CL: 21%, 42%). All non-relapse mortality in our population occurred within 14 months of transplantation, whereas the latest relapse-related mortality occurred nearly 10 years after transplantation. Conclusion: Our results suggest that relapse-related mortality is the predominant reason for mortality 5 years post-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation among pediatric cancer patients in Argentina. Nevertheless, non-relapse mortality is substantially higher in our population than posttransplant pediatric cancer patients in Europe (cumulative incidence = 9.0% 1 ), and the predominant reason for mortality within the first year following transplantation. Future research should aim to identify which modifiable factors can be targeted for intervention to help reduce non-relapse mortality following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in this population Introduction: Intra bone marrow transplantation (IBMT) of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) might be a promising alternative to conventional intravenous application of HSC in order to improve the homing efficiency and to accelerate the early engraftment after transplantation. Especially for transplantation of limited cell numbers the IBMT might prevent a delayed engraftment. Here we investigated the impact of the graft infusion rate on the hematopoietic recovery as well as on the engraftment kinetics after allogeneic IBMT in a canine DLA-identical littermate model following reduced intensity conditioning. Material (or patients) and methods: Dogs were conditioned with 4.5 Gy total body irradiation. The graft volume was reduced by buffy coat centrifugation and dogs obtained 2x25ml into the femur and humerus simultaneously. The infusion period of the graft was 10 min in group 1 (IBM10, n = 8) and 60 min in group 2 (IBM60, n = 7). Cyclosporin A (15 mg/kg, BID) was administered as immunosuppression from d-1 until d+35 post transplantation. The hematopoietic recovery was monitored daily by blood counts and the development of the chimerism for the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and granulocytes was determined weekly.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3279, "end": 3300, "text": "September 1, 1998 and", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3301, "end": 3313, "text": "May 31, 2015", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4243, "end": 4248, "text": "2-8.4", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "AB65"}, {"text": "Results: All animals of both groups engrafted.

Bone marrow cytology at this time showed exactly the same arrest of granulopoiesis at the level of promyelocytes, increased eosinophils and fully recovered erythro-and megakaryopoiesis as before SCT. However, graft failure was ruled out as the BM cells expressed 100% donor chimerism. In search of an etiology, antibodies against granulocyte antigen HNA-2 (CD 177) were detected at titers of41:4,000. Plasmapheresis was started 47 days post SCT. The titers decreased to 1:2,000 after the first, to 1:2 after the 4th, and to 1:1 or 0 after the 9th (and final) plasmapheresis.

Material (or patients) and methods: Case report: A 19 year old previously well female was referred with an ECOG of 3 and 9 week history of pyrexia, weight loss and abdominal pain. This was secondary to hepatosplenomegaly, mild pancytopenia (Hb 8.4 g/L, WCC 2.05 x10 9 /L, Neutrophils 1.35 x 10 9 /L and Platelets of 134 x10 9 /L), abnormal LFTs (Bilirubin 17 mg/dl, ALT 341 IU/L, Alk Phos 1675IU/L) and an LDH of 2086IU/L. Infection work up was negative apart from a positive EBV IgG. Her EBV DNA viral load was 43.5 x 10 6 . She was commenced on prednisolone and valganciclovir for four weeks for suspected infectious mononucleosis prior to referral with no improvement. A CT thorax/abdomen/pelvis confirmed hepatosplenomegaly and 1cm mesenteric/periportal adenopathy. A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy was performed which showed trilineage haematopoiesis with reactive features. The mesenteric node and liver were biopsied and were consistent with CAEBV, T-cell subtype with EBER positive T-lymphocytes and clonality confirmed by TCR beta and gamma rearrangement. Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis was excluded as she had a ferritin o800ng/ml, normal triglycerides and had no evidence of haemophagocytosis in the biopsies. Results: She was treated with a hybrid protocol of gemcitabine, etoposide and dexamethasone for 4 cycles because of her poor performance status and abnormal LFTs and achieved a PR with improvement in LFTs, blood count, scan and undetectable EBV DNA. She was consolidated with a reduced intensity matched unrelated SCT using fludarabine, busulphan and alemtuzumab conditioning resulting in engraftment at day 14. She had grade one skin graft versus host disease but no post-transplant EBV reactivation. She had LFT normalization after six months and remains well eighteen months post-transplantation. Conclusion: We have presented this case to raise awareness of a rare manifestation of EBV infection and effectiveness of allo-SCT in its treatment (1) . This case is unusual in that the patient had serological evidence of previous EBV infection with an unknown re-activation trigger, whereas it is usually triggered by a de novo infection. Introduction: Patients with relapse of high grade lymphoma after autologous transplantation or with primary refractory disease have a dismal prognosis. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a potentially curative salvage treatment but data on outcome with this approach are limited.

The median age at time of allo-HCT was 46 (range, 28-68) years. 68% (n = 26) of patients had received an autologous transplantation prior to allo-HCT. If allo-HCT was used as primary transplantation strategy, refractory disease or inadequate mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells was present. Prior to allo-HCT patients were treated with a median of 5 chemotherapeutic regimens (range, 1-8) and 87% (n = 33) of patients received rituximab prior to allo-SCT. At start of conditioning therapy, 32% of patients had refractory disease and 37% were in complete remission. Myeloablative conditioning regimens (MAC) were used in 45% of patients and 55% were treated with reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). There were no differences in median HCT-CI score between RIC and MAC group (range 0-4). The median age for patients receiving MAC and RIC was 44 years and 54 years, respectively. Peripheral blood stem cells were exclusively used as graft source. Donors were matched related (MRD, n = 16), matched unrelated (MUD, n = 16), mismatched unrelated (MMUD, n = 4), or haploidentical (n = 2).

Transformation in high grade lymphoma did not result in inferior OS (P = 0.37). The use of RIC regimen resulted in significantly better median survival rates irrespective of disease risk index (MAC 2 months vs RIC 52 months, P = 0.01). The non-relapse mortality (NRM) at day 100, 1 year and 3 years was 18%, 26% and 31%. NRM after 1 year was higher after MAC with 35% compared to 14% after RIC.

In the autologous haematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT) setting, the prognostic value of pre-AHCT PET has been established by current studies, but the significance of early post-AHCT PET negativity has not yet been fully investigated. Material (or patients) and methods: In this retrospective, single center analysis, we evaluated the role of early post-AHCT (+3 to +6 months) metabolic remission in 58 consecutive HL patients (pts), aged 36 (13-62), who underwent AHCT during 2009-2014, for primary refractory (43), or relapsed disease (15) post 3 (1-9) lines of treatment. Disease status was chemosensitive to salvage treatment in 29 pts. The conditioning regimen was BEAM (17) or Busulfan-based (Busulfan 9.6 mg/kg, Etoposide 400 mg/m 2 and Melphalan 140 mg/m 2 , BuEM) (41). Results: Forty eight pts were evaluated by PET at +3 to +6 months (m) while the rest had disease progression by CT assessment (7 received additional involved field irradiation post-AHCT, as part of the treatment plan). Thirteen pts had positive and 35 negative PET. The overall early-response rate by PETevaluation was 73% (35/48 evaluated pts). In univariate analysis, overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) were superior in pts achieving early post-AHCT negativity (5y-OS 89% vs 29%; P = 0.007, 5y-DFS 78% vs 22%; P = 0.012). Patients' characteristics according to the conditioning regimen were similar in terms of disease phase and chemosensitivity (x 2 test). With a median follow up of 29 (2-76) m (BEAM 18, BuEM 45 m), the estimated 5year DFS and time to progression (TTP) were similar in both conditionings. At last follow-up 40/48 (83%) pts were alive and 32 (66%) in CR. Treatment related mortality was low with both regimens (1%). Overall survival was high and similar in both conditioning groups, with no significant difference in DFS. In multivariate analysis disease phase, chemosensitivity, type of conditioning and early-PET evaluation were incorporated. Early PET-negativity was the only significant factor correlated with superior OS (P = 0.02). In terms of DFS, disease chemosensitivity identified as significant favorable factor (P = 0.02), while early metabolic remission was of borderline significance (P = 0.06). Conclusion: With the limitations of this retrospective analysis, early metabolic complete remission, along with disease chemosensitivity to salvage treatment, seems to be the most significant predictor in HL pts for improved overall survival and time to disease progression. Both conditioning regimens proved to be similarly efficacious and feasible, remaining the key players for a successful outcome of AHCT in lymphomas. Additionally, early PET can optimize the outcome in HL patients regarding the need for post AHCT consolidation in the era of novel targeted agents. Introduction: High-dose chemotherapy and either autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is one of the considered treatment options for patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) but there are limited data about this issue in the pediatric setting. Material (or patients) and methods: We examined the role of HSCT for patients aged less than or equal to 18 years at the time of transplantation with relapsed or refractory lymphoblastic (n = 24), Burkitt (12), diffuse large B cell (13) and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (n = 17), receiving autologous (n = 38) or allogeneic (n = 28) (n = 20 matched sibling/family, n = 5 unrelated and n = 3 mismatched related donor) registered at the Turkish Pediatric Bone Marrow Registry. Risk factors affecting survival were evaluated using stratified Cox regression. Fifty-seven patients (84%) had chemo-sensitive disease at the time of transplantation. Results: Overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were 68% and 59% with a median follow-up of 39 months; OS and EFS according to histopathological classification were 51% and 49% for lymphoblastic, 67% and 67% for Burkitt, %86 and 65% for anaplastic large cell and, 77% and 61% for diffuse large cell lymphoma, respectively. The outcomes were similar in regard of both OS and EFS in patients receiving autologous and allogeneic HSCT (68% vs 70% and 55% vs 62%, respectively). Both OS and EFS among patients with chemosensitive disease at the time of HSCT were significantly higher than those in patients with chemo-resistant disease (74% vs 33%, P = 0.001; 71% vs 22%, P o0.001, respectively).

Material (or patients) and methods: 121 newly diagnosed patients with aggressive NHL were included from March 2007 to December 2013 in our center. Before proceeding transplantation, cases of patients in CR1 are 65, 28 cases of CR2, 18 cases of PR and 10 cases of NR. All patients were been treated by chemotherapy of three times (CTOD or MOED) plus highdose MTX (1-3 g/m 2 ) before transplantation. CEAC is considered as the preparative regimen that including additional local supplementary radical radiotherapy for patients with large mediastinal masses. The total four weeks biological treatment including five days of IL-2 and two days of rest, that was applied for the patients with hematopoietic recovery. The patients who showed CR before and after transplantation adopted consolidation treatment every three months, of which total courses are 4 to 6 and 6 to 8. Patients who showed PR following transplantation accepted autologous transplantation in 3 months after transplantation. Patients who presented NR or RE accepted allogeneic transplantation. Results: All patients acquired hematopoietic reconstitution, in which the average reconstituted time of ANC was +11.6 d and PLT was +14.2 d respectively. The main complications are tolerable, including gastrointestinal reactions (82.9% of incidence rate), oral mucositis (51.2% of incidence rate) and mild liver damage (19.55% of incidence rate) which does not affect the progress of sequential treatment. The median follow-up time was 54 months (range 6-97 months). Among CR1 survivors, 55 patients are disease-free (84.6%) and 10 survivors with disease(15.6%) and no death; 20 CR2 survivors are disease-free (71.4%), 15 CR2 survivors with disease (15.2%) and 5 deaths (17.8%); 8 PR survivors are disease-free (61.5%), 2 PR survivors in disease (15.4%) and 3 deaths (23.1%); 2 NR survivors are disease-free (20%), 3 NR survivors with disease (30%) and 5 deaths (50%).

Here we present the treatment outcomes of our MM patients who have undergone high-dose chemotherapy with ASCT for the last 13 years with different induction regimens. Material (or patients) and methods: We retrospectively analyzed a total of 156 patients who received high-dose melphalan (HD-MEL) followed by ASCT from August 2002 till October 2015 in our centre. Results: The majority of the patients were from the Malay ethnicity, comprising of 56.41% of the cohort. Most of our patients were above 50 years old with 49.36% in the 50-59 years age-group and 21.79% aged above 60 years respectively. The induction strategy prior to ASCT has evolved from VAD regimen accounting for 15.38% to Thalidomide(T)based or Velcade (bortezomib) (V)-based regimens totaling 77.56% with time. About 7.05% of the patients had dual-novel agents (both thalidomide and Velcade) as induction treatment prior to ASCT. There were no significant age differences among the 4 groups. The Velcade-based and dual-novel agent groups had more male patients, accounting for 75% and 64% respectively. A majority had IgG subtype MM (VAD 61%, Thalidomide-based: 73%, Velcade-based: 70% and dual-novel agent: 80%). At least 2/3 of patients in all 4 groups achieved VGPR after induction with the highest CR/nCR among patients receiving dual-novel agents at induction. More patients in the Thalidomide-based, Velcade-based group and dual-novel group attained CR/nCR (26%, 29% and 36% respectively) as compared to VAD regimen (22%) prior to ASCT. All patients successfully underwent PBSC mobilization and proceed with ASCT. The median day of neutrophils engraftment was 1 day earlier for Thalidomide-and Velcade-based as well as dualnovel group as compared to VAD for which median engraftment was Day+11. The incidence of TRM was 2%. The overall survival (OS) of all MM patients from the time of diagnosis was 50% at 86 months. The median survival post transplant was 66 months from the time of transplant. Conclusion: ASCT remains a relevant treatment option to deepen the response post induction and to prolong survival of MM patients in resource-limited settings such as Malaysia as compared to maintenance with new novel agents which are not as easily accessible as compared to ASCT.

Jindra 1 1 Hemato-oncology department, Charles University Hospital Pilsen, Pilsen, Czech Republic Introduction: Multiple myeloma (MM) is malignant haematological disease affecting up to 600 people a year in the Czech Republic. Treatment options are constantly improved but autologous transplantation (Tx) remains an integral part of treatment protocols despite the development of modern drugs. Profit in using two autologous Tx versus single Tx is documented but without a recommendation of time interval between these two Tx. We compared 2 groups of patients with 2 Tx in our studyin the first group (28 patients) was performed second Tx calculatedly on reaching PR and worse after induction in median of 5.5 months (2 -11) . In the second group (38 patients) was performed second Tx in relapse without previous re-induction in median 8 months (4-8). Subanalysis divided this group in 2 subgroups according value of paraprotein before the second Tx (cutt of for \u2026low level\" of paraprotein was 10 g/l,event. 1000 mg/l in MM with light chains), other findings were taken as \"high level\" including 3 patients with extramedullary disease. Other parameters were comparable (age, type of induction treatment, cytogenetic risk) without statistic difference in both groups. Material (or patients) and methods: Retrospective analysis of patients with MM in order to compare time to initiation other treatment after last autologous Tx (TFS), overall survival (OS) in two different groups and baseline level of paraprotein by second Tx in patients transplanted in relapse. Results: The analysed group consisted of 66 patients. Group was divided in two parts. In patients in the first part autologous Tx was performed as tandem Tx (n = 28), in the second part was until the time of relapse (n = 38).

It has been reported that the CD105 (Endoglin) involved in angiogenesis and is a powerful marker for angiogenesis in colorectal carcinoma. Level Quantitative angiogenesis in peritumor and intratumor area is important to know because it is closely related to the micro environmental factors that influence the occurrence of cancer angiogenesis.

Material (or patients) and methods: The BMT unit (CIC 859) was established in 2004. We retrospectively analyzed data from 482 patients over 10 years (2004-DEC 2014): 419 autologous, 63 allogeneic (2010-2014). The median age of patients in the autologous group is 43 years (20-67), and 35,8 (20-59) in the allogeneic group. The number of transplanted patients in years was as follows: 2004 (N = 10); 2005 (N = 23); 2006 (N = 18); 2009 (N = 34); 2010 (N = 59), 2011 (N = 73), 2012 (N = 83); 2013 (N = 94); 2014 (N = 87). In the autotransplanted group the large proportion of patients took those with Multiple Myeloma (N = 171), followed by Hodgkin's Disease (N = 114) and NHL (N = 108), solid tumors (N = 4) and AML (N = 8). Allogeneic stem cell transplantation was performed in patients with Aplastic Anemia (N = 5), AML (N = 32), ALL (N = 17), CML (N = 1), NHL (N = 1), Hodgkin`s Disease (N = 1), Multiple Myeloma (N = 3), MDS (N = 1), CLL (N = 1), plasma cell leukemia (N = 1). Depending on availability of donor 35 patients were transplanted with Related Donor (RD), 28 patients with Match Unrelated Donor or Mismatch Unrelated Donor.

Panico, Tricase, Italy Introduction: Invasive fungal infections increase morbidity and mortality in the early neutropenic phase after allogeneic haemopoietic stem cells transplantation (HSCT). Posaconazole is a new oral azole with a wide spectrum activity and a safety profile. Material (or patients) and methods: We analyze efficacy and safety of posaconazole during the early phase post allogeneic HSCT (74 recipients (70%) from February 2008) in comparison with fluconazole primary antifungal prophylaxis (32 patients (30%) up to January 2008).Results: Groups were comparable in terms of age, underling disease, number previous chemotherapies, status at transplant, median time to HSCT, previous autotransplant, use of unrelated donor, type of conditioning, incidence of GvHD and GvHD prophylaxis. The median CD34+ infused cells was 4,8x10^6/Kg (range1,05-19,5) in posaconazole group and 5,04x10^6/Kg (range1,02-20,1) in fluconazole group (P = 0,54). Neutrophil and platelets engraftment was similar in the two groups, table 1. Incidence of febrile neutropenia episodes (49(66%) in posaconazole vs22(68%) in fluconazole; P = 0,79) and invasive fungal infections (3(4%)in posaconazole vs 1(3%) in fluconazole; P = 0,81) were comparable for both antifungal agents. However, patients receiving posaconazole had a lower incidence of empiric/preemptive antifungal therapy (10(20%)vs11(50%); Po0,01) which associated with a higher probability of systemic antifungal treatment free time (21% vs 57% at 100 day; Po0,01). The median days of antifungal treatment were 12 in posaconazole and 10(1-29) in fluconazole group (P = 0,19). No difference was observed in terms of 1yTRM (28% in posaconazole and 36% in fluconazole; Po0,99) and 1yOS (58% in posaconazole vs55% in fluconazole; Po0,77). No adverse serious events occurred during the antifungal prophylaxis. Fifteen patients (20%) treated with posaconazole temporarly withdrawn the drug because of gastrointestinal symptoms. Conclusion: Our experience suggests that antifungal prophylaxis with posaconazole is well tolerated and may lead to a lower rate of empiric/pre-emptive antifungal therapy and a higher probability of systemic antifungal treatment free time period for patients in the early neutropenic phase post allogeneic HSCT.

Material (or patients) and methods: Twenty two fully HLAmatched, allogeneic bone marrow transplants for non malignant diseases have been performed from 2012 to 2015 at BMT Unit in Cairo University Children Hospital. One HLAmatched allogeneic BMT performed back in 2008. Thalassemia major (TM) forms 56.5% (n = 13) of total transplants so far, SAA contributes to 34.7% (n = 8) of total transplants while severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) forms 8.69% (n = 2) of total transplants. Results: Seven patients suffered from graft failure (30.4%). Four patients were classified as primary graft failure (57.1%) while three cases (42.8%) were classified as secondary graft failure and they were secondary to acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD), CMV reactivation and non compliance to post transplant immunosuppressives respectively. Six patients (one male and five females) were cases of TM; received Busulfan (Bu)-cyclophosphamide (Cy)-antithymocyte globulin (ATG) as a conditioning regime and cyclosporin (CSA) as a prophylaxis for GVHD. While one patient was a case of SAA, male, received CY-Flu (fludarabine)-ATG as a conditioning regimen and CSA as prophylaxis for GVHD. Donors of stem cells in the seven cases were males. Four patients received peripheral stem cells (PSC) and three patients received bone marrow harvest in their 1 st transplant. Three patients were retransplanted using ATG (10 mg/kg/day) for 3 days and one patient received TBI (total body irradiation) -CY-FLU in retransplant. Outcome of graft failure was death in one (14.one case in 2008, five cases in 2012-2013 and one case in 2014 and none in 2015. Conclusion: Our regimen has some limitations; we use oral busulfan with no feasibility for monitoring drug level.

However, the outcomes of patients who suffer from leukemic relapse remain unsatisfactory. Despite the high cure rate of children and adolescents with ALL a subgroup of patients benefit from allogeneic HSCT. Allo HSCT remains the standard treatment for intermediate/high risk AML patients. Material (or patients) and methods: Forty-two patients, ALL = 30 and AML = 12 age 1 to 20 years with median age 11.5 years, M/F = 19/23(M/F ALL = 14/16, AML = 5/7) underwent SCT in our hospital(from 2012-2015).

However, normal karyotype AML, which consist almost half of the AML, doesn't have any conclusions about its prognosis. Therefore, in this study, outcome of the patients with normal karyotype AML in Yeungnam region of South Korea to make the guide for future treatment. Material (or patients) and methods: Medical information of the patient who diagnosed and treated in Yeungnam region hospitals between 1st Jan 2000 and 1st Aug 2015 were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Results: Total of 235 patients were diagnosed as AML in Yeungnam region, and the 197 patients received treatment at the hospital located in Yeungnam region. Among them, 36 patients were normal karyotype AML. 8 patients showed CR after 1st induction chemotherapy, but 26 patients achieved CR after all induction phase. Among the patient who achieved CR, 5 patients relapsed, and only 1 patient alieved. 14 patients received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and rest of them received only chemotherapy. 7 patients who received only chemotherapy were alive. The overall survival rate was 63.8%, and the median survival time was 7.5 years. The overall survival of the patients who received allogeneic HSCT was 78.6%, and the median survival time was 8.5 years. The survivals of the patients who received allogeneic HSCT superior significantly compared with that of the patients who did not received HSCT. Conclusion: Patients with normal karyotype AML showed relatively good outcome. The survival rate of the patients who received allogeneic stem cell transplantation was significantly higher than that of the patients who did not. But due to the short-hand of this study, the roll of HSCT should be evaluated through further study.

Recently, intensive therapy with effective supportive care has increased survival rates to 70%. Material (or patients) and methods: We performed a retrospective study on patients with AML diagnosed from 2000 to 2013 Yeungnam region. Total of 263 patients were enrolled from 10 institutes. Results: Age at diagnosis was 8.8 \u00b1 5.7 years. Male to Female ratio was 1.48:1. In FAB classification, M2 (34.3%) were most common, followed by M1 (14%), M3 (11%), M4 (11%), M5 (11%). M7 (5.5%), and M0 (3%). After induction, 77% of patients were achieved complete remission (CR). After first CR, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was performed as consolidation in 54% of patients. The overall survival for patients who did not undergo transplantation was 73.2%, whereas it was 75.62% for HSCT (P = 0.935). The 2-year overall survival rate was 64.7%. The 2-year overall survival rate for patients who diagnosed before and after 2006 were 55.5% and 72.3%, respectively (P = 0.049).2-yr OS and EFS of AML in Yeungnam region is 62.5%, 58.3%, respectively. The outcome has improved significantly after 2006. (OS 71.7%, EFS 64.4%). Multivariate analysis showed age under 2 years has poor outcome. Conclusion: The clinical outcome of pediatric AML patient had been improved. The outcome has improved significantly after 2006. Age under 2y has poor outcome.

Pivkova Veljanovska 1 , D. Miloska 1 , L. Cevreska 1 , B. Georgievski 1 1 University Clinic for Hematology, Skopje, Macedonia, The Former Yugoslav Republic OfIntroduction: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a well-defined hematologic disorder that presents as a big challenge to all physicians. Can a doctor from the haematology department be a noble man confronting this disease? We represent a small bone marrow transplant unit that manifests a big,,struggle,, during the past 15 years, achieving results that fuel up the battle for the future to more aggressive and more productive. Maybe, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has the only curative potential in the therapeutic approach to this patients. Material (or patients) and methods: During the last 15 years we have performed 360 HSCT. The gender distribution of our patients was males 184, and females 176. The most frequent indication for HSCT was AML, representing 44% of all transplanted patients, or precisely 129 patients. In this group of patients, 78 (60%) were autologous HSCT in first complete remission (CR), and 41 (40%) allogeneic sibling HSCT. In the autologous setting, we used Bu-Cy conditioning regimen in 50 (62%) patients, G-CSF+etoposide 2000 mg/m 2 total dose in 39 (63%) patients as standard mobilising regimen. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) were used in 62 patients (80%). The mean age at diagnosis was 41 years, we performed an average of 1.59 apheresis procedures, with the mean amount of 3.0x10 8 MNC. The average days to engraftment was 12. In the allogeneic setting, the mean age to transplantation was 34 years. We used Bu-Cy conditioning regimen in 39 (76%) patients, and Bu-Cy-Mel in 10 (19%) patients. Acute GvHD was confirmed in 19 patients (38%), and chronic in 16 (31%). 32 (63%) patients were transplanted in CR, and 19 (37%) in active disease.Results:The 5 year overall survival (OS) in AML patients treated with allogeneic sibling HSCT was 55%. In term of the disease status before, those patients that were in CR, had 5 year OS of 73%, despite those that were transplanted in active disease, with 5 year OS of only 15%. In the autologous setting, the 5 year OS was 44%. The main reason for mortality was relapse of the primary disease. Conclusion: HSCT is a well-established, justified and proven therapeutic option for AML patients, especially for patients in CR and appropriate risk profile. Still there is much to be done, maybe on the field of the initial treatment, conditioning protocols, or the management of GvHD. References: 1.

Outcome analysis of either single center series or Registry cohorts showed no advantage in using high intensity regimens, assuming that Myeloablative regimens are supposed to have a high transplant-related toxicity and a similar therapeutic impact on an Autoimmune Disease. We report here two successful aHSCT in very active MS forms using two intermediate intensity, myeloablative regimens. Material (or patients) and methods: Case 1. A 33 years old woman with aggressive MS and advanced disability (EDSS 6.5) was enrolled in a transplant program and planned to receive a BEAM/ATG conditioning regimen. A severe anaphylactic reaction occurred after BCNU infusion, requiring her transfer to ICU. After her return to BMT Unit we decided to finalize the conditioning regimen with just Melphalan, without ATG. Case 2. A 27 years old woman with relapsing remitting MS and moderate disability (EDSS 4.5) was also planned to receive a BEAM/ATG conditioning regimen. The rectal swamp collected upon admission showed a Carbapenems-Resistant Klebsiella Pneumoniae (KPC); therefore we decided to exclude melphalan and ATG from the conditioning regimen. Results: Complete engraftment occurred in a normal range for both patients;. no viral reactivations nor major adverse events after transplant were shown. Patients underwent periodic follow-up after HSCT for 6 years and 18 months, respectively. Both patients didn't show any clinical relapses, disability progression nor new lesions at MRI (NEDA3 negative); clinical assessment showed an EDSS score improvement (from 6.5 to 5.5 and from 4.5 to 4.0, respectively) in both patients. Conclusion: Despite the administration of a purely myeloablative regimen and the lack of ATG, both patients experienced a full neurological response and a very good hematological tolerability. The optimal conditioning regimen for MS is still to be defined.

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only curative measure. Material (or patients) and methods: Case report A 2-year-old girl with SCN (heterogeneous missense mutation in exon 4 of ELANE gene) developed, although under treatment with G-CSF, an acute appendicitis with perforation. She survived under antibiotics, 3rd party donor granulocyte transfusions and after surgery. Her bone marrow cytology at that time showed an arrest of granulopoietic precursors at the level of promyelocytes, increased eosinophils and normal erythropoiesis and thrombopoiesis, the characteristic BM picture found in SCN. Having survived this event, she received peripheral hematopoietic stem cells from a 9/10 matched unrelated donor after conditioning with fludarabin, thiotepa, treosulfan and ATG at 2 years and 10 months of age.

Sharma 1 Hemato-oncology and BMT, BLK Super specialty hospital, Delhi, IndiaIntroduction: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) can cure sickle cell disease (SCD). This option is however limited by availability of matched sibling (MSD) or related unaffected donors. Over the years results of alternative donor HSCT have increased significantly. Outcome of matched unrelated donor BMT for SCD is as good as MSD but literature on mismatched unrelated donor HSCT for SCD is scarce. We report a child with SCD with complications being successfully transplanted using mismatched (mismatch at A locus) unrelated donor. Material (or patients) and methods: 18 year old boy with SCD on regular transfusions was taken up for mismatch unrelated donor HSCT in the absence of suitably matched sibling or unrelated donor. He was conditioned using busulfan 3.2 mg/kg/day x 4 days, cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg/day x 4 days and hATG (pfizerATGAM) 30 mg/kg/day x 3 days. GVHD prophylaxis included cyclosporine and methotrexate. Patient received GCSF mobilized peripheral blood stem cells harvested from unrelated donor with a target MNC 48x10 8 /kg. He received 9.03x10^8/kg mononuclear cells, 8.5x10^6/kg CD34 cells. Results: Polymorphonuclear cell and platelet engraftment were seen on D+9 and D+16 respectively. Whole blood chimerism on day +21 showed 99.45% donor cells. He developed engraftment syndrome which was managed with steroids. He later suffered from reactivated CMV which was managed with ganciclovir. He was discharged on D+20 in good clinical condition. He is currently D+380 post HSCT having limited oral GVH on tapering doses. Post HSCT his sickle percentage has gone down from 88% to 22%. Conclusion: Mismatched unrelated donor HSCT can be successfully done in the absence of suitably matched sibling or unrelated donor for SCD using myeloablative conditioning. Options of mismatched unrelated donor HSCT for SCD needs to be explored further.

Zangooei 1 MAHAK Cancer Children's Hospital, Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic Of Introduction: Despite the generally excellent prognosis of children and adolescents with Hodgkin's lymphoma, approximately 20% of patients relapse. High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is a recognized treatment option for patients with relapsed Hodgkin's lymphoma. This study evaluates the results and outcome of non-cryopreserved autologous stem cell transplant of 25 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma. Material (or patients) and methods: Twenty-five patients age 5 to 25 years (median 15.5 years, M/F = 18/7), with relapsed, refractory or poor prognosis HD, underwent ASCT in our hospital(from 2012-2015). Status at transplant was: second complete remission (CR2): n = 13; further CR (CR 42): n = 10, partial remission (PR): n = 2. Twenty-five patients received chemotherapy-based conditioning regimens: cyclophosphamide, carmustine and etoposide (CBV): 6, CCNU, etoposide, cytarabine and melphalan (CEAM): 19, Peripheral blood (PB) was the source of progenitor cells in 25patients.

Only one patient had death, two years after transplantation. No significant different between CBV group vs. CEAM group in engraftment day. Conclusion: High-dose therapy with stem cell rescue can lead to durable remissions in children and adolescents with advanced HD. Future investigations should focus on strategies designed to decrease relapse after auto-transplantation, particularly in patients at high risk for relapse. Our analysis suggests that these regimens (CEAM, CBV) are feasible in pediatric patients with acceptable engraftment and toxicity.

Mihai 1 1 Hematology, Colentina Clinical Hospital Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania Introduction: As patients with osteosarcoma become longterm survivors, increasing attention has turned to the burden of late effects. Recent studies showed an increase in the incidence of secondary malignant neoplasms in patients with osteosarcoma compared with the general population. The risk of developing leukemia was reported to be in an increasing rate in the last decade. Different molecular and pathogenic agents may be implicated in the development of second malignant neoplasms in long-term survivors of osteosarcomas. Some authors believe that the treatment with topoisomerase II inhibitors may have a role in the development of sAML,while others talk about cisplatin-associated sAML.

In this report we present the case of a 19 year old patient diagnosed in the Hematology Department of Colentina Clinical Hospital in February 2015 with Acute Myeloid Leukemia following the treatment (chemo-and radiotherapy) for an osteogenic osteosarcoma performed 3 years earlier.Results: In this report we present the case of a 19 year old patient diagnosed in the Hematology Department of Colentina Clinical Hospital in February 2015 with Acute Myeloid Leukemia following the treatment (chemo-and radiotherapy) for an osteogenic osteosarcoma performed 3 years earlier. The cytogenetic examination revealed an abnormal karyotype with 91 chromosomes (XXY). The molecular biology exam did not find mutations in the FLT3ITD, FLT3D835 and NPM1 A genes. After the first induction course of chemotherapy the patient achieved complete remission, which was consolidated by 3 more courses of chemotherapy and an allogeneic stem cell transplant. Conclusion: Considering the prior treatment for the osteosarcoma consisting of radiotherapy and chemotherapy we considered this to be a secondary Acute Myeloid Leukemia, this representing a major negative prognostic factor, along with the cytogenetic abnormalities found. These factors strongly indicate that the first complete remission should be consolidated by allogeneic stem cell transplant. The particularities of this case are the association of the two malignancies in a young patient, the presence of the abnormal karyotype (hyperploid), and also the good response of the patient to the induction therapy, achieving complete remission after the first induction course, and of course, sustaining that response.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 165, "end": 168, "text": "1 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 935, "end": 938, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 939, "end": 941, "text": "2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 942, "end": 944, "text": "3]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "AB77"}, {"text": "Tandem auto transplants of peripheral blood stem cells for lymphoblastic lymphoma: a single center retrospective study J.-L.

Centro Hospitalar e Universit\u00e1rio de Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal, 2 Centro Hospitalar e Universit\u00e1rio de Coimbra, Centro Hospitalar e Universit\u00e1rio de Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal Introduction: At the present time multiple myeloma (MM) is a consensual indication for high dose chemotherapy (HDC) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). However, most of the larger trials evaluated the role of ASCT in MM patients with 65 years of age (Y) or younger. Once MM is frequently diagnosed in the elderly, it is crucial to understand if there is a role for ASCT in an older group of patients. In this study we aimed to compare the immediate toxicity and long term results of MM patients submitted to ASCT according to their age. Material (or patients) and methods: We retrospectively evaluated all MM patients eligible to HDC and ASCT in our centre between January/2007 and December/2014. Analyzed data: age at the time of ASCT, number of hospitalization days (HD), number of days with neutropenia o0,5x10 9 /L, number of days with thrombocytopenia o 20x10 9 /L, gastro-intestinal toxicity, oral mucositis, need for endovenous antibiotherapy, number of packed red blood cells (RBC) and platelet's concentrate transfusions, need for parenteral nutrition, treatment related mortality (TRM), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). For the purpose of toxicity analysis, all the transplants were considered (n = 161) whereas for the outcome investigation, only first transplants were analyzed (n = 135). Results: The male:female ratio was 1.3. At the time of the ASCT the median age was 59Y . 132 patients were o65Y and 29 \u2265 65Y. The elderly group had higher number of HD (mean 27 days vs 20 days; P = 0.0024). The number of days with thrombocytopenia o20x109/L (8 Vs 5 days) and with neutropenia (7 Vs 9 days) and the number of RBC units transfused (1.4 Vs 2.5) were superior in the older group as well (P = 0.0025, 0.0339 and Po 0.0016, respectively). There were no significant differences regarding other toxicity related parameters and the TRM was null in both groups. Regarding long term outcomes, PFS was similar in both groups (median PFS was 3.8Y in the o65Y group and 4.0 in the \u2265 65Y, P = 0.35). We did not find statistically significant differences in OS as well (median OS not reached in both groups, P = 0.17). Conclusion: Despite the higher HD and hematological toxicity in the \u2265 65Y group, there was no major impact in patients' prognosis and also no increase in TRM. On the other hand, the outcome was comparable in both groups. Even aware of the limitations regarding the small sample size and the retrospective analysis, our experience indicates that ACST is safe and effective in MM patients older than 65Y as in the younger group.

F. Baptista 1,* , C. Geraldes 2 , R. Introduction: Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) remains a standard of care for multiple myeloma (MM) patients who are eligible to receive high-dose therapy. Factors that can predict success of this approach are still object of various studies. We aimed to investigate if early ASCT or better response to this therapy were predictive of treatment success. Material (or patients) and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the outcome of first ASCT in MM patients from 2007-2014. All tandem transplants were excluded. Groups analyzed: 1) patients receiving ASCT less than 1 year (Y) after diagnosis (o1Y) Vs the ones who received ASCT \u2265 1Y after and 2) patients who reached very good partial response or better (\u2265 VGPR) after ASCT Vs the ones with inferior responses (oVGPR). Responses were evaluated 100 days after ASCT according to the International Myeloma Working Group response criteria. Results: There were 135 patients with a median age at the time of the transplant of 58Y [28-69] and male:female ratio of 1.3. In 68 cases ASCT took place o1Y and in 64 \u22651Y. Three patients were excluded from this analysis due to lack of clear information. We found that 74 reached very good parcial response or better (\u2265 VGPR) and 61 inferior responses ( oVGPR). Median progression free survival (PFS) was superior in the early ASCT group (4.0Y Vs 1.5Y; P = 0.0021). Overall survival (OS) was also superior in the o1Y ASCT (not reached Vs 4Y, P = 0.0112). Median PFS was higher in the \u2265 VGPR group (4.5Y Vs 2.8Y, P = 0.0196). OS was slightly better in the \u2265 VGPR group but there was no statistically significant difference (median OS not reached in any group; P = 0.161). Conclusion: Both timing of transplantation and quality of treatment responses seemed to be good predictors of clinical outcomes. Early transplantation associated with better PFS and OS. Moreover, the better response group showed higher PFS and OS, even though only superiority of PFS was proven statistically significant. Although being a small and retrospective study with considerable limitations, our experience favors the effort to proceed to ASCT as soon as possible and to achieve better responses in order to obtain a more effective control of the disease.

Since 1995. until 2013. we treated 60 pts (39 men and 21 female), average age 55,5 years.ISS1 15 pts, ISS2 10 pts, ISS3 35 pts.Renal insufficiency was present in 35 pts. High risik pts was defined by the presence of following factors:b2M 45,5 mg/l, albumineo3,5gr/dl, CRP 46, high lactat dehydrogenase, renal failure,stage III.Pts treated with induction,consolidation and maintenance therapy.Conventional induction treatments were applied as following regimens: VAD(42), MP(9), CTD (3), PAD (2),TAD(4). Results: Clinical response was achieved in 41pts (70%),while in 19 pts (30%) established disease was resistant. SCT had been done with 33 pts (55%), while 27 pts (45%) were treated with conventional chemotherapy adjusted to the vital age and comorbiditity. In the group of pts with transplantation done tandem had been carried out with 11 pts and secondary SCT had been done in 4 relapsed pts. With 1 pts with tandem SCT allogenic (singen) SCT had been done. TRM is 3%. Maintenance therapy had been done in 31 pts.Impact of high risk factors on outcome/PFS/OS was of no significance, except for elevated high lactat dehydrogenase values that are associated with rapid relapse. The presence of bone lesions associated with short PFS and with no difference in OS. In the group of transplanted no difference in OS with/without a response to primary therapy, but in the nontransplanted pts OS was significance shorter in patients who did not achieve a response.The transplanted patients had significantly longer PFS (mediana 14 months vs 8 months, P o0,05) and longer OS (mediana 50 months vs 20 months, Po0,001). 20 pts (33%) of treated pts are living, while 40 pts (67%) died.

Bortezomib, as the representative, has been recommended as first-line treatment in guideline for many years. But whether bortezomib-based regimen as first induction chemotherapy has different outcome remains unknown. Material (or patients) and methods: We retrospectively analyzed 38 patients with MM undergoing autologous stemcell transplantation to compare different outcomes in patients treated with bortezomib-based regimen (n = 25) for the first time induction chemotherapy to those without (n = 13, including 9 cases administrating bortezomib later because of ineffectiveness of original plans or relapse) after newly diagnosed between 2007and 2014. Results: Before transplantation, all patients achieved at least partial response (PR) according to International Myeloma Working Group uniform response criteria. The median (range) numbers of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CD34 + cells in each group were 9.43 and 10.12 \u00d710 8 /kg (P = 0.59), 5.02 and 5.28 \u00d7 10 6 /kg (P = 0.87), respectively.

Median time to disease progression in two groups was both 43 months. Conclusion: Bortezomib-based regimen as the first induction chemotherapy may have no significant benefit in terms of OS and TTP.

Conclusion: The role of allo-HSCT in multiple myeloma is strongly discussed and frequently neglected. Due to of small numbers, heterogeneity of patients and follow-up from periods with different therapeutic protocols, there is no conclusive consensus of allo-HSCT implementation. Our retrospective analysis suggests that in the setting of primary refractory disease allo-HSCT is probably ineffective. However, in the contest of responsive therapy disease allo-HSCT could determine CR and possibly offer permanent cures.The current use of new agents can determine a more incisive reduction of burden disease before allo-HSCT trough increasing its efficacy.
