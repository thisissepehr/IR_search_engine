First, the estimated 7-year risks of primary HCC were 12% and 10% in the HBV and HCV cohorts, respectively. In addition, the risk did not significantly differ between patients exposed and not exposed to ACEIs or ARBs within 6 months after antiviral therapy. Second, after adjustment for comorbidities (including liver cirrhosis, DM, and hyperlipidemia) and time-dependent variables of medications (aspirin, metformin, and statins), ACEI and ARB use was not a significant predictor of primary HCC in the HBV cohort (aHR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.81-1.16) and in the HCV cohort (aHR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.80-1.16). Third, liver cirrhosis was a universal risk factor in both cohorts and in all subgroups. Finally, in the HCV cohort, ACEI or ARB use was associated with increased HCC risk in subgroups of patients without cirrhosis, DM, and hyperlipidemia.

Because advanced cirrhosis is a relative contraindication for interferon therapy in patients with HCV [37] , the use of interferon therapy as a patient selection criterion in this study may explain the significant but relatively low effect of liver cirrhosis on HCC development in the HCV cohort. Meanwhile, HBV patients with advanced liver cirrhosis or decompensation are candidates for HBV medication in the reimbursement program of Taiwan's National Health Insurance.
