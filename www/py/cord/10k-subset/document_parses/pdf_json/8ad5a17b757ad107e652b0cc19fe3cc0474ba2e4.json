Studies have shown that the proportion of Tfr cells may increase during acute inflammation. In this study, we investigated the role of Tfr cells in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We found that Tfr cells were significantly enriched in peripheral blood and in mini-bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) during the onset of ARDS. Notably, Tfr cells represented the majority of Treg cells in the mini-BAL samples. Tfr cells also showed CTLA-4, IL-10, and TGF-\u03b2 expression, but compared to the non-Tfr Treg cells, the CTLA-4 and IL-10 expression by Tfr cells were slightly reduced. Both Tfr cells and non-Tfr Treg cells suppressed the proliferation of autologous CD4 + CD25 \u2212 T cells; however, the Tfr cells displayed slightly reduced suppression capacity. Subsequently, B cells were co-incubated with autologous Tfr cells or non-Tfr Treg cells. Interestingly, we found that the frequency of IL-10 + Breg cells was significantly higher following incubation with Tfr cells than with non-Tfr Treg cells, which suggested that Tfr cells were more potent at inducing IL-10 + Breg cells. Together, these results demonstrated that Tfr cells were a similar but distinctive subset of Treg cells. Given that Tfr cells were strongly enriched in ARDS patients, especially in the lung infiltrates, they may exert critical ameliorating effects in ARDS.",

            "text": "T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cell is a recently discovered T regulatory (Treg) cell subset with critical roles in regulating germinal center responses and modulating the immune environment in the lymph nodes [1] . Tfr cells present features of both T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and Treg cells, including CXCR5, PD-1, ICOS, CTLA-4, and Foxp3 expression [2] . Currently, it is thought that Tfr cells differentiate from Treg cells that gain access to the B cell follicles in the spleen, lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches [1, 2] . Following interaction with cognate B cells in the germinal center and the B cell follicles, these Treg cells gain fully differentiated Tfr phenotype with PD-1 and ICOS expression, and may stay in the B cell zones, exit the lymphoid tissues and enter circulation, or infiltrate the peripheral tissues [3, 4] . Representing approximately 1% of the total CD4 + T cells, and 6% of total Treg cells in draining lymph nodes, Tfr cells are a small but critical population in the development of antibody responses. In mice, Tfr cell depletion resulted in elevated numbers of GC B cells, antigen-specific B cells, and plasma cells, and increased serum antibody titer [2, 5, 6] . Sorted human Tfr cells (CD4 + CXCR5 + CD25 + CD127 \u2212 T cells) were shown to suppress antibody production in vitro [7] . Mechanistically, Tfr cells can suppress Tfh cell expansion and cytokine production in a CTLA-4-dependent fashion [8] . Interestingly, CTLA-4-deleted Tfr cells promoted the production of low-affinity antibodies [8] , suggesting that Tfr cells likely improved the quality of the antibody response by Hongqiang Li and Runv Zhou contributed equally to this work. preventing overactive Tfh-mediated antibody secretion. Recently, studies demonstrated that Tfr cells were dynamically regulated in acute and chronic virus infections. During influenza infection or LCMV infection, Tfr cells in the lymphoid organs presented a drop in frequency, and it is possible that this drop was required for the generation of virus-specific antibodies [1] . In contrast, Tfr frequency appeared to increase in chronic HIV infections, as well as in chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C patients [9, 10] . The frequency and function of Tfr cells in other settings have not been extensively investigated.",

Despite years of research, ARDS remains a life-threatening condition with only palliative treatments available [12] . Activation of effector immune cells and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines are found in the lung of ARDS patients, both of which can increase alveolar membrane permeability and coagulation in a perpetuating positive feedback loop [13] . On the other hand, Treg cells in humans and murine acute lung injury (ALI) models can disrupt the proinflammatory process, reduce disease severity, promote injury resolution, and accelerate healing [14] [15] [16] [17] . In addition, we previously showed that early recruitment of IL-10-producing Breg cells and elevated IL-10 secretion could suppress the production of proinflammatory cytokines and predicted better survival in ARDS patients [18, 19] . The role of Tfr cells, on the other hand, has not been elucidated in ARDS patients.",

Unpaired t test with Welch's correction. c The frequencies of Treg cells, Tfr cells, and non-Tfr Treg cells in the mini-BAL from ten ARDS patients. RM 1-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test. *P < 0.05. **P < 0.01. ***P < 0.001. NS not significant Fig. 3 The expression of inhibitory molecules by non-Tfr Treg cells and Tfr cells from healthy controls and ARDS patients. a Fresh PBMCs from healthy controls, PBMCs from ARDS patients, and fresh day 1 mini-BAL lymphocytes from ARDS patients were examined by flow cytometry directly ex vivo. The expression levels of CD25 by Tfr (Foxp3 + CXCR5 + CD4 + ) cells (solid black line), non-Tfr-Treg (Foxp3 + CXCR5 \u2212 CD4 + ) cells (dotted black line), and Foxp3 \u2212 CD4 + T cells (gray area) in one representative from each of the three samples were shown. b The Tfr cells were sorted from each frozen-and-thawed sample as CD4 + CD25 + CXCR5 + T cells, and the non-Tfr Treg cells were sorted from each sample as CD4 + CD25 + CXCR5 \u2212 T cells. The expression levels of CTLA-4, IL-10, and TGF-\u03b2 from each cell type from ten healthy control PBMCs, ten ARDS PBMCs, and ten ARDS day 1 mini-BAL are represented as ratios over \u03b2 2 microglobulin (\u03b2 2 m). Two-way ANOVA followed by Sidak's test. *P < 0.05. **P < 0.01. ***P < 0.001. NS not significant Fig. 5 Tfr and non-Tfr Treg-mediated promotion of IL-10 expression in B cells. From frozen-and-thawed ARDS PBMCs, the Tfr cells were sorted as CD4 + CD25 + CXCR5 + T cells, and the non-Tfr Treg cells were sorted as CD4 + CD25 + CXCR5 \u2212 T cells. B cells were enriched using negative selection, and were incubated with Tfr cells or non-Tfr Treg cells at 5/1 B/T ratio. After 72 h incubation with SEB, the frequency of IL-10 + B cells was examined by flow cytometry. RM two-way ANOVA followed by Sidak's test. ***P < 0.001. NS not significant. Symbols directly above the datasets indicate the difference between the 72-h experiment and the 0-h control Fig. 4 Tfr and non-Tfr Treg-mediated suppression of CD4 + CD25 \u2212 T cells. From frozen-and-thawed ARDS PBMCs, the Tfr cells were sorted as CD4 + CD25 + CXCR5 + T cells, and the non-Tfr Treg cells were sorted as CD4 + CD25 + CXCR5 \u2212 T cells. The CD4 + CD25 \u2212 T cells (effector) were also sorted and incubated with Tfr or non-Tfr Treg (regulatory) cells at the indicated ratios. After 72 h in the presence of T activator beads (anti-CD3/ CD28), cells were pulsed for 6 h with tritiated thymidine and harvested, and the amount of radioactive thymidine incorporation was examined. RM two-way ANOVA followed by Sidak's test. *P < 0.05. ***P < 0.001. NS not significant. Symbols directly above the datasets indicate the difference between the labeled dataset and the no regulatory cell control (0/20) dataset mini-BAL samples tended to present higher expressions of inhibitory molecules, it is possible that the Tfr cells from mini-BAL samples had more potent capacity to mediate suppression. Also, our in vitro experiments need to be verified in animal models of ARDS to prove that Tfr cell-mediated effects could ameliorate or prevent tissue damage mediated by inflammation. In addition, specific gene knockout experiments are necessary to investigate which inhibitory molecules are required for Tfr cell-mediated suppression in vivo. ",
