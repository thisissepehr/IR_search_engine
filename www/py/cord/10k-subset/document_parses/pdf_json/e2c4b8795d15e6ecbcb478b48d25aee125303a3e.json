But, these properties require that the transition be suitably regular (Hastings and Wysham 2010) . Specifically, to observe critical slowing down requires that the potential function of the system, if it exists, be smooth. Also, for systems with multiple attracting sets (e.g., bistable systems), a sufficient level of noise gives rise to \"flickering\" which exhibits the characteristic increase in variance (but for a different reason) and not the increase in autocorrelation Dakos et al. 2012b) . Other obstacles to anticipating critical transitions in infectious diseases include that epidemiological systems are complicated by amplification of transients and oscillatory dynamics Bauch and Earn 2003) , that infectious diseases are often seasonally forced (Altizer et al. 2006; Fraser and Grassly 2006) and propagate in demographically open systems subject to imported cases , and that diseases that are close to elimination or close to emerging are, by definition, characterized by low prevalence and, therefore, both subject to demographic stochasticity and difficult to observe (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2009 ). Therefore, to determine whether diagnostic noise-induced phenomena accompany the critical transitions that occur in infectious disease dynamics, namely the transition to endemicity of emerging infectious diseases and the transition to extinction in disease elimination, it will be useful to have a quantitative theory, both to guide the selection of statistical quantities to be investigated and to predict the form that observable quantities should take as the transition is approached. This paper is a contribution to this theory. We consider the compartmental susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) and susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) models, which are widely used to represent the dynamics of a range of nonimmunizing and immunizing pathogens and may be viewed as approximations to an even broader class of infectious diseases. In their deterministic formulations, these models are characterized by a transcritical bifurcation at R 0 = 1, where the endemic and disease-free steady states meet and exchange stability. The epidemic models we investigate are generalizations of the closed population SIS and SIR models that allow for immigration from external sources, of which the more familiar models without immigration that are characterized by a transcritical bifurcation are special cases. To appropriately model the slowly forced dynamical system, we first develop mean field theory for the nonstationary systems gradually approaching a bifurcation. We develop the mean field theory here because slowly forced dynamical systems approaching a bifurcation have rarely been investigated (but see Kuehn (2011) ). We then develop the full stochastic description in terms of a master equation. Our strategy is to use the van Kampen system size expansion to separate the mean field dynamics from the fluctuations induced by demographic stochasticity. These fluctuations are described by a Fokker-Planck equation, from which the power spectrum, variance, autocorrelation, and coefficient of variation may be analytically obtained. Our main result is contained in Table 4 , which provides formulas expressing these theoretical predictions in terms of the dominant eigenvalue of the mean field solutions, which goes to zero as the system approaches the critical transition. Hence, these formulas express how epidemiologically measurable quantities are expected to change as the system approaches the critical transition. A number of approximations are introduced in the derivation of these formulas, including separation of time scales, second-order description of the fluctuations, and continuum representation of the state space. We, therefore, performed simulations to study the possible detrimental effects of these approximations. Specifically, we examined the agreement between the theoretical predictions and \"measured\" statistics obtained in a moving window, as one would analyze real-world data, in both discrete state-space and continuous state-space simulations. We show that the analytical expressions are robust, provided the conditions of fast-slow systems are met. These results demonstrate that the critical transitions associated with disease emergence and elimination may be anticipated even in the absence of a detailed understanding of their underlying causes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 306, "end": 325, "text": "Dakos et al. 2012a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 398, "end": 424, "text": "(Hastings and Wysham 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 804, "end": 823, "text": "Dakos et al. 2012b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1011, "end": 1031, "text": "Bauch and Earn 2003)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1087, "end": 1108, "text": "(Altizer et al. 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1109, "end": 1133, "text": "Fraser and Grassly 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1412, "end": 1436, "text": "(Lloyd-Smith et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 3050, "end": 3062, "text": "Kuehn (2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3512, "end": 3519, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "We first consider a general SIS model that allows for immigration.

(2) can encompass a variety of infectious disease systems, including closed population SI models. Thus, the system can be used to model diseases that confer no long-lasting immunity, e.g., sexually transmitted diseases or acute infections such as influenza or diseases that are fatal. If \u03b7 = 0, Eq. (2) has two equilibria: the disease-free equilibrium y 0 = 0 and the endemic equilibrium y * = (1 \u2212 1/R 0 ), where R 0 = \u03b2/\u03b3 denotes the basic reproduction number. When R 0 > 1, the infection can persist, but if R 0 < 1, then the infection dies out. The equilibria y 0 and y * meet and exchange stability when the basic reproduction number R 0 = 1, i.e., a transcritical bifurcation occurs. We will refer to the SIS model with no immigration as the limiting case. However, it is usually more realistic to assume that a low level of immigration occurs, i.e., \u03b7 is positive. If \u03b7 > 0, then Eq. (2) has a single positive equilibrium that is always locally stable, provided \u03b2, \u03b3 > 0, since the slope at the equilibrium \u03bb = \u03b2 \u2212 2\u03b2y * \u2212 \u03b3 \u2212 \u03b7 is negative.

Therefore, the transcritical bifurcation occurs in a suitably constructed limiting case (\u03b7 = 0), which we suggest gives an indication for the behavior of the fluctuations for the stochastic version of the model with immigration, provided \u03b7 is small. Slow changes in the transmission rate \u03b2, through demographic or evolutionary means, may induce a transcritical bifurcation of Eq. (2). For example, transmission may decrease as a result of slow increases in vaccination uptake among the population, leading to extinction of the pathogen, or it may increase due to slow decreases in vaccination uptake, potentially causing a transition to endemicity.

The proportion of the population that are vaccinated is modeled by the function p(t) = p s + p 0 t, with p 0 an incremental change in \u03b2. Hence,\u03b2 = p 0 . If p 0 > 0, then the rate of transmission is slowly declining over time, and if p 0 < 0, it is slowly increasing. The limit case \u2192 0 of Eq. (3) is Eq.

We assume that the population size is constant, i.e., S(t) + I (t) = N. Since the population size is constant, we need only model the transitions into and out of the infectious state. Furthermore, since the SIS system moving towards a bifurcation is a fast-slow system, the transmission rate \u03b2 is not constant in time but is a slowly changing function of time.

The autocorrelation of the fluctuations with a lag of 1 year is shown, and the variance shown is the fluctuation variance. All calculations used the parameter values in Table 7 SIR leading indicator predictions Leading indicators for SIR systems approaching elimination ( Fig. 8d-f ) are not always consistent with the standard expectations of increasing variance, increasing autocorrelation, and increasing coefficient of variation. In addition, the predictions for the leading indicators of SIR disease elimination evaluated about the endemic equilibrium of the stable system behave differently to SIS leading indicators, due to the presence of resonant frequencies. As the threshold to elimination is approached, the lag-1 autocorrelation increases with vaccination uptake, indicating an increase in system memory, but in contrast to the SIS model, the fluctuation variance declines. We observe in Fig. 7b , d that the area under the power spectrum declines as vaccination uptake increases, particularly in the model with \u03b7 > 0, where the height of the peak of the power spectrum, which reflects amplification of fluctuations, declines close to the transition. The coefficient of variation also increases, indicating that infectious time series should become noisier as the transition is approached but does so more dramatically in the model without immigration, because the power spectrum peak height increases as the transcritical bifurcation is approached. To examine how different changes in vaccination uptake p 0 affect the statistics, we varied p 0 by 1/500 and 1/30 year \u22121 in the fast-slow model with immigration. Predictions generated from the p 0 = 1/500 model are in close agreement with predictions arising from the \u03b7 > 0 stable model. However, when vaccination uptake is increasing an order of magnitude faster (i.e., p 0 = 1/30), there can be temporary fluctuations, including increases, in the variance (Fig. 8e) .

The variance is also predicted to increase, as suggested by the increasing area under the power spectrum in Fig. 7c .

The rapid rise in the mean can be seen in Fig. 4a . However, the coefficient of variation is predicted to increase as the transition is approached if the statistic is evaluated about the solution of the fast-slow system. This is because the mean remains small long after the predicted critical transition (Fig. 4a) . However, the limiting case theoretical predictions for the trends in the statistics for systems on the threshold of emergence do not always agree with the predictions for the corresponding fast-slow systems beyond the critical threshold for emergence.

Delays are of fundamental interest because they provide a mechanism for the frequent realization of far-from-equilibrium situations and because they are a dramatic example of tipping point phenomena in infectious diseases. Indeed, delays can cause a system to appear to undergo a catastrophic shift (e.g., the b a d c f e Fig. 11 Performance of the statistics over a moving window for the SIR system approaching elimination, assuming that immigration occurs (\u03b7 > 0).

Our results show that two kinds of delays occur in disease emergence and elimination. The first delay is a deterministic phenomenon referred to as a canard (Diener 1984) . Canards occur in fast-slow systems where the solution follows an attracting slow manifold of the fast-slow system, passing close to a bifurcation point, and then follows a repelling slow manifold for a considerable period of time. Thus, for instance, in Fig. 3a , which depicts the emergence of an SIS infection, the \u2192 0 limit case branch rapidly increases close to the \u03b7 = 0 critical point, but the solution of the fast-slow system ( > 0) tracks the disease-free equilibrium for a noticeable amount of time even after it has become unstable. The influence that the canard has on the stochastic dynamics can be observed in Fig. 3b , where the number of infectious individuals remains in the vicinity of the precritical level for a noticeable period of time. A related phenomenon, but not so dramatic, is observed in the elimination case (Fig. 2a) . Following the bifurcation, the infectious population remains elevated, but unlike the emergence case, no dramatic shift to extinction occurs.

In this case, the number of infectious individuals in the population prior to the critical transition is most commonly zero. Assuming that there are no infectious individuals in the population at the time of the bifurcation event, then the number of infections in the population will remain zero until the time that an imported case arises.

The magnitude of the real part of the eigenvalue, which approximates the rate of decay of the amplitude of the oscillations to the equilibrium, decreases as elimination is approached, but, near the threshold, the magnitude of the real part begins to increase once more, indicating a shorter return time to equilibrium and increased resistance of the system to perturbations, as the spiral begins to resemble a node. This subsequent decline in system memory is reflected in the decrease in the autocorrelation function near the critical point. The more rapid decay of the oscillations is also reflected in the power spectrum, in that the the spectrum peak declines as vaccination uptake increases, meaning that the resonant frequencies become less amplified.

It is understood, of course, that for discrete systems (such as infectious disease transmission), this continuum representation is only an approximation, and, moreover, that the approximation breaks down as the system size-or even if the size of just one important compartment-becomes small. The case of disease emergence, where the number of infectious individuals in a population prior to the critical transition is typically zero and only occasionally one or more, is precisely this situation. It would not be surprising, therefore, to discover the approach taken in this paper to perform poorly in this situation. But, this is not the case. As Figs. 13 and 14 show, in both the SIS and SIR systems, the \"measured\" statistics obtained in simulation are qualitatively similar to the analytic expressions reported in Table 4 , with the exception of the coefficient of variation in the SIR model. We note, further, that although emergence was difficult to predict (AUC values were not much greater than 0.5), the van Kampen detrending, which we think of as the theorydependent approach, typically performed better than generic Gaussian detrending, which may be computed without any theoretical assumptions. It is, nevertheless, a concern that the approach taken here will be misleading under some scenarios: for instance, a very slow approach to the critical transition, when the time between immigration events may be large and the van Kampen approximation is likely to break down. Moreover, the stochastic features of bifurcation delay, particularly important in the emergence scenarios, depend heavily on (a) the sequence of immigration events by infectious individuals, and (b) the probability of nonextinction for a transmission chain initiated by an infectious individual after the critical point has been passed.

(4) in the main text more amenable to analytical analysis, we approximate the discrete infectious state random variable by a continuous random variable \u03b6 ,We are anticipating that the probability distribution will depend on the population size N. We do not assume what equation \u03d5(t) satisfies, but we will see later that it is equal to the proportion of infectious individuals at time t, in the limit of infinitely large population size N; the system size expansion will give rise to the mean field theory discussed in the \"Mean field theory of SIR model\" section. Equation (10) says that fluctuations (denoted by \u03b6 ) about the deterministic state I/N are expected to be of the order of N \u22121/2 , which is expected from the central limit theorem, and so the fluctuations in I are of the order N 1/2 (Van Kampen 1981). If the population size N is large, we intuitively expect fluctuations to be small. Consequently, the probability distribution for the system being in a certain state at time t is expected to have a peak located at the deterministic value N\u03d5(t) and a standard deviation of the order N 1/2 . The approximation (10) turns out to be a normal random variable.The system size expansion is described in detail by the van Kampen (Van Kampen 1981) and has been applied to one-dimensional population biology models (McKane and Newman 2004) . Therefore, we do not include the full details of the expansion of Eq. (4) in this paper. In summary, there are five essential steps: (1) write down transition rates (e.g., Table 2 ); (2) derive the master equation for the Markov process; (3) rewrite the master equation in terms of jump functions; (4) substitute the ansatz (10) into the master equation and perform the expansion; and (5) collect deterministic (leading order) and stochastic (next-to-leading order) terms to obtain the deterministic system and its stochastic correction.Rewriting the master equation as described in detail in (Van Kampen 1981) and performing the system size expansion using Eq. (10), at leading order, give rise to the differential equation that \u03d5(t) satisfiesThis is simply the fast-slow system (3). At the next-toleading order, the method leads to a linear Fokker-Planck equation for the distribution of the fluctuations about the solution \u03d5(t), ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1391, "end": 1415, "text": "(McKane and Newman 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1590, "end": 1597, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Appendix A"}, {"text": "Note that p is assumed to be constant in a small time increment and is evaluated at the current time t.
