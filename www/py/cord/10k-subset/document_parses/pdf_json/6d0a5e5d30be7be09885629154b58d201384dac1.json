Methods : SPECT allowed the reconstruction of three types of slice according to the long axis (LA) of the heart which are called as in 2 D-Echocardiography : short-axis (perpendicular to LA), long-~xis (parallel to LA), 4-chambers (parallel to LA) slices. The myocardial fixation was analysed in 5 walls (septal, anterior, lateral, inferior, Apex) by two independent observers who did not know angiogram results. Material : ]26 pts with IHO (coronary stenosis ~ 50 %) divided as follows : 63 one vessel disease (L.A.D. : 32, R.C.A. : 2~, LC.X. : IO), 37 two vessel disease (2 VD), and 26 three vessel disease (3 VD). 33 pts without coronary steresis : 26 Normal (group A), 7 pts with normal coronary arteries and angina or prior myocardial infarction. In conclusion : Exercise SPECT has an overall sensitivity of 96 % and an overall specificity of 85 %. This allows us to consider it at the moment as the best non invasive method for the diagnosis of I.H.D. To determine the clinical impact of scintigraphy in coronary artery disease (CAD)~ the indications, diagnostic yield and contribution to patient management ~ere reviewed retrospectively in 105 patients referred for routine investigation, f\u00d7ercise and redistribution image data ~ere collected in multiple projections and inferpreted by visual and semi-quantitative means. A segmental image defect ~ss accepted as indicating the presence of CAD. Ii-201 sc~ntigraphy ~ss performed as a diagnostic procedure in 71 patients (69,~) ~ho had equivocal evidence of CAD. In 57 (80,%) of these patients, ~i-201 scintigraphy was ~ormal and 53 (75,~) ~ere spared diagnostic coronary srteriography, Despite normal If-Z01 seintigraphy, arteriography ~as performed in 4 patients ~ith persisting symptoms and demonstrated normal vessels in 2 patients and single vessel disease in 2 patients. Conversely, arteriogrsphy ~ss normal in 3 of 19 patients (16,~) ~ith unequivocal image defects. Ti-201 scintigraphy ~as performed as a Functional complement to coronary srteriography in 32 patients, influencing the decision for coronary surgery in 10, for sngioplmsty in 9 and against surgery in 2.

The value of thallium-201 exercise scintigraphy for the detection of multivessel disease after myocardial infarction (MI) was determined in 176 patients 6 weeks after a first MI. In all patients coronary arteriography was performed within 3 days after the noninvasive procedure. Of the 176 patients, 77 had multivessel disease (prevalence 44%). The thallium-2Ol scans were qualitatively assessed, and a positive scan was defined as an exercise-induced reversible defect in the noninfarcted region.",

The GRAD (mean+SD) is listed in relation to positive (+) or--negative (-) TL201, and %MAR. In the 18 patients with <90 %MAR, the GRAD was higher (P<.001) in those with +TL201 (64+15) than those with -TL201 (33+20) but their %NAn did not differ significantly (72+14% vs 66+19%; P=NS). At multiple regression analysis (N=22) the presence of a TL201 defect (p<.001) was a strong and %NAn (P<.05) a weak independent predictor for GRAD. Exercise workload, heart rate, blood pressure, and stress ECG results did not significantly predict GRAD. It is concluded that TL201 adds valid information on the hemedynamic significance of a stenosis independent of %MAR. This may be of most value when %MAR is <90% and the clinical significance of the stenosis is uncertain.

Sointi~aphy with 1251 MIBG gives a lower radiation exposume than 151I MIBG and provides a sensitive and reliable means of locating a wide range of phaeochromocytoma. The adrenocortic~l imaging agent, 1311-6B-iodomerhylnorcholes~erol (NP-g9), has been used ~o scintigraphically depict disease of the adrenal cortex in 490 patients studied over an eight year interval (1976) (1977) (1978) (1979) (1980) (1981) (1982) (1983) (1984) . One mCi/l.73 M 2 was administered to 160 patients with suspected Cushing's Syndrome leg) and to 31 patients with miscellaneous disorders of the inner adrenal cortex. Images were obtained a= 5 to 7 days post injection in this group. Dexamethasone suppresslo~ of pituitary adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) was given Co 157 patients with primary aldosteronism (FA) and I19 patients with adrenal hyperandrogenlsm (A~): 8 mg for 2 days or 4 mg for 7 days prior to NP-59 and ~hroughou~ a 5 day pose-injection imaging interval. In CS 5 patterns of adrenal imaging were noted tha~ were a direct consequence of the pathophysiologlc process: ACTH dependent CS -bilateral adrenal visualization, ACTH independent CS from adrenal adenoma showed unilateral uptake, while ACTN independent CS due to nodular hyperplasia showed marked asymmetric adrenal uptake. CS due to carcinoma was depicted as bilateral nonvisualization. PA was depicted as early unilateral uptake (< 5 days) in adenoma and bilateral early uptake (< 5 days) in bilateral hyperplasia; while in AH early unilateral viaualizatio~ (< 5 days) was seen in patients with an adrenal adenoma, bilateral early visualization (< 5 days) in patients with adrenal hyperplasia and bilateral nonvisualization in those patients without an adrenal eontrihutio~ ~o abnormal androgen levels. There were 3 false positive studies for adenoma in CS~ PA, and AH and 6 false negative studies for bilateral hyperplasia and adenoma. Thus, AS is an efficacious modality for the localization of adrenal function in patients with suspected diseases of the adrenal cortex. The field of Nuclear Medicine and its practitioners, the physicians and the technician, utilize two primary tools: radionuclides and detection instruments. The early history of Nuclear Medicine primarily relates the development of radionuclides and radiopharmaceuticals. George DeHevesey introduced the tracer concept into biology in 1923. He proved that the amount of radiation needed for tracer studies was so small that the system under study would not be affected. Dynamic flow studies were classically reported by Blumgart and Weiss on the velocity of the circulation in patients with heart disease in 1927, seven years before the discovery of artificial radioactivity by Curie and Joliot. With the invention of the cyclotron I by E. O. Lawrence in 1931 radioiodine, 1-131, became the pre-eminent radionuclide of Nuclear Medicine during its infancy.",

The value of ultrasonography(US),99mTc-sulfur co lloid liver scan(LS) and perztoneoscopy(P) in the diagnosis of malignant focal liver disease (MFLD) has been evaluated cuantitmtively according to a score from -2 to +3 referred not only to tbe intrinsic information(IS) provided but al_ so to its impact on the prevzous clinical impre ssion(CS), and cualitatively according to the sual indexes:sensitivity(Se),specificity(Sp),the predictive value of a positlve (PVP) or negetive (PVN) test and accuracy(Ae).Seventy-seven conse cutive patieats with confirmed MFLD,56 with liver metsstases(LM) ~nd 21 hepat0cellular csrcinoma(HCC) were the study group.One hundred and twenty consecutive patients with diffuse liver disease(DLD); ii acute hepatltis,14 fatty live~ 24 chronic hepatitis and 71 hepatic cirrhosis were the control group.The results are shown in the Two hep~tobiliary(HB)agents, dilnethyl-IDA(HIOA) and p-butyl-IDA in form of instant kits produced in our department were subjected for a comparative biokinetie study in animals and human beings. The organ distribution data of the HB agents in mice showed substantial differences in the extent and rate of HB clearance and kidney uptake. The animal studies indicate that they are not in the same group of HB ~xcretmres as man. The in vivc plasma binding with both HB agents were determind by recording the activity of the columns(GCS-profiles)with a gamma camera. The high affinity of p-butyl-IDA to plasma protein, is probably influenced the rate of HB excretion into the bile.To the normal subjects NIDA and p-butyl-IDA were given in a dose of 5-TmCi, and the dynamic study was performed under gamma camera. To 19 individuals,7 patients were given HIDA and the rest were given p-butyl-IDA. Sequential scintigrams in a supine position were recorded every 5s/frame for the first 2min and a 30s/frame for the rest SCmin. Rectangular regions of interest were flagged,and the histograms were computed. In normal subjects, the duration of kidney visualization,early and late hepatic pictures,time of begininq visualization of bile duct and gallbladder and the appear= ance of agent in the gut were investigated. The data obtained in ~ormal subjects showed that HIDA provided superior hepatic duct images and rapid gallbladder visualization. Both agents showed rapid blood clearance. However, other differences were demonstrated which will be discussed. Thyroid hormones have a marked effect on cholesterol metabolism. They have been proved efficient in lowering plasma lipid concentration. The LDL clearance is increased from the plasma whereas the LDE synthesis is unchanged. However, D-thyroxine treatment induces high levels of plasma bilirubin concentration and increased activities of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and alkaline phospbatase.",

The entero-hepatic circulation is broken, serum bile acid levels fall and serum cholesterol drops. The serum bilirubin level tends to fall. Cholestyramine increases fecal fat even in normal subjects. To study the effect of such kind of changes, related to bile salts, on the processus of 99m-Tc diethyl IDA-hepatobiliary excretion, we have performed biodistribution studies of the above radiopharmaceutical in mice after treatment by Cholestyramine~ The drug was administered by addition of 4 g of resin to 150 ml of drinking water. The ingestion of that mixture by the animals lasted 5 days before the injection of gge-Tc diethyl IDA. The biodiatribution study showed normal blood clearance and hepatic uptake of 99m-Tc diethyl IDA. A significantly higher than normal level of radioactivity was found in the gallbladder from the 5th min to the first hour after iRjection (14.3% to 4.2% at 1 hr), and the excretion of radioactivity into intestine was lower than normal (50.1% to 68.6% at I hr). It is suggested that conditions similar to cholestasis are simulated in mice by cholestyramine treatment. That effect may be related to the resininduced disruption of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. Restrained elimination of radioactivity from the gallbladder into intestine would be the consequence of these induced changes.",

Portal-systemic shunting is an important consequence of all diseases that lead portal hypePten s~on. A practical and noninveslve technique to evaluate hepato-fusa] f~ow by recta] infusion o\u00a3 a radiotracer is described. The basis o\u00a3 the test is to profit by the presence of the inferlor po~ taceva] anastomosis, that, trough the inferior mesenterlc vein, connects the splenic vein to the recta[ and anal network, in order to ~emonstPate the shunt. Fast{rig subjects ~re placed in She supine posit~on and 3mCI of mgc0-were infused by a mlCrOclysteP (~ml). A computerlzed large field sclnt~l[ation camera with a 140 keV parallel hole collimator was positioned to view the entire liver and heart from the anterior aspect, Images with e 64x 64 resolution were recorded at the rate of one per 20 sec for 5 min. Were obtei ned the histograms (activlty/t~me) of two regbns of interest (heart-H, liver-L) a~ter the test a,~ the ratio H/L was calculated. In the normal subi ects, morphological findings were the immediate visuailzation o~ the liver end subsequently o\u00a3 the heart. H/L ratio at 2 min was \u2022 0.5, ~n 32 clrPhotJc patients with portal hypertension (ego phages] varJces and hJ9h wedged hepatic vein pr~ sure-WHVP) the tracer reached immediat[y the heart and the H/L ratio was constantly > 1.5. A close correlation was found between the H/L ra tic and WHVP, concentration of serum albumin and pPotrombin time. This technique is shown to be useful in assassin 9 and in monitoring the patients wlth portal hypertension, After inhalation (Veenstra XV~133) or intravenous application of 133-Xe the course of activity was registered with an Anger-camera (Picker Dyna 4) over the upper abdomen (liver and spleen) as well as the exspirated air and recorded and stored by a computer (DEC PDP 11/34) Measurement of hepatic blood flow was performed in 19 patients with cirrhosis of the liver and we found a flow of 55.8+11 ml/100 g~/min. In five patients we ~d this investigation twice on the same day and with one hour interval and there was no statistical difference between this two measurements and we found a very good correlation (r=O.976). This noninvasive technique for measurement of liver blood flow is easily, rapidly and repeatedly performed The results suggest that liver blood flow is decreased in patients with liver cirrhosis as we could show in former more invasive investigations with 133-Xe. With the splenoportography(direct injection of 133-Xe into the spleen) we found in patients without liver disease a flow of 103.4+12 and with cirrhosis of the liver 0f--58.1+12 ml/lOO gm/min. Simultaneously this ~echnique provides a good information of the presence of extra-and intrahepatic shunts. With the arterial method (133-Xe into the A. hepatica propria) we found the liver blood flow with 89.9+3 in patients without liver disease and of 49.3+11 ml/ 1OO ~/min in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. The retrograde-venous method (133-Xe into the hepatic vein) showed in patients with liver cirrhosis a flow of 50.3+11 ml/100 gm/min. Radiocolloid kinetics within the first two minutes after i.v. injection is described with a new model which takes into account vascular transport thr E ugh dual hepatic circulation and extraction by Kupffer cells. 99mTc-human serum albumin colloids (3-4 mCi, 2-20 nm particle size) were used~ Images (32x32) were collected at the rate of one per second using a large-field-of-view computer i zed gamma-camera. Curves obtaimed in several ROIS were analyzed automatically and parameters of the model were evaluated by means of a non-linear least-square procedure: extraction efficiency (E); transit time (T), arterial flow (AF) and venous flow (VF) through \"functional\" hepatic paren~n~a; transit time through intra-hepatio artero-venous anastomoses (TS) and shunted arterial flow (SAF); and hepatic clearance (CI=E(AF+VF)). Freliminary results (Table) are in agreement with well known physiopathological data. The method proposed a\u00a3 pears to be simple, fast, safe and reproducible, and thus suitable for routine use in the assess ment of liver hemodynemics for clinical purposes. Possible applications include the follow-up of phs]~macological and surgical treatment and the differentiation between arterialized and non-art E #ialized liver lesions. After an injection of 99mTc04-liver perfusion examinations were carried out, then the TFS were computed by a program package /UNIDEK/ of the gamma camera computer system. On the basis of liver TPs /L-TP/ a new method to analyse quantitative liver perfusiou examinations was found out\u00b0 L-TF gives the arterial mean transit time /MTTa/, the portal MTT ~TTn/, the ratio of arterial and portal blood flow / A/P / and the shape of the portal upstream. The computed L-TFs are independent from the quantity of the activity injected and from the efficiency of detection, thus data of different patients can be compared quantitatively. Normal values /14 control patients/: MTT~=5.is SD~l.3s; MTTp=20\u00b04a SDi5.3s; A/~=19%/81% SD\u00b18% . Pstzents with portal hypertension /ll cases/ : MTTa=6.3s SDil.4a; MTTo=IO.Ys SDi4.4s; A/P=53%/47% SD!15% \u2022 MTTp is significantly shorter /p<O.OO1/ in portal hypertension due to porto-systemic shunts. Spleen T2 /S-TF/ gives additional pieces of information. Normal MTTs /16 patients/=5.9s SD!l.2s. By computing L-TF, S-T~ aud kidney T~ special circulatory problems can else be investigated. We present 4 concrete cases,too: l\u00b0eomplete portal occlusion;2, compressios of the v. portae;3.typicel circulation after Billroth II;4.occlusion of the v. hepatica. Our method can be used to define the vascular status of the liver and to monitor the effects of therapeutic interventions. Its importance is enhanced by the fact that liver circulatien can be directly defined by the L-TO. Radionuclide fatty acids metabolism in relationsheep ~ith heart has been studied by many authors. Ho~ever, liver is the most important organ in the fatty acid metabolism. Liver study has been performed, in 1\u00a3 patients ~ith 16-iodo-91~xadecenoic acid (IHA). The IHA label led ~ith I was supplied as a labelling kit (SEA,France). The experiment ~as done in supine position ~ith a gamma camera connected ~ifih a computer, lee total time of measurement is ~0 mn after IHA intravenous injection (]7 MBq). lhe backgroundl~tivity correction (at ]0 mn, 11 MBq Na I) is described by Freundlieb et al (i). 2 patients groups were separated by clinical and biological analysis : 7 ~ith normal Liver (A) and 12 with liver cirrhosis (H). Before the isotopic investigation, total cholesterol (If), total triglycerid (TT), Apo A and ADO B ~ere measured ; also 2 isotopic parameters ~ere computed on the liver corrected curves : I max = time of the maximum count and %lS:perce~ rage of [HA excretion 1Smn after [max. In o~oup A : % 15 is correlated ~ith TC (r=-0,82~ p(O,05) and mith Apo B (r= -0,88 ~ p ~0,05) i it is net correlated eith TT and ANn A. In group 8 : there is no correlation between isotopic parameters and lipidic dalas. Also~ the group A liver scans are clearly visible and homogoneous ; on the contrary, in group B, there is a reduced and inhomogeneous distribution. Our preliminary study shoms that IHA can be used as a good tracer for certain dyslipidemias ;aIso it could be used as a Functional hepatocyte marker. Further examinations are needed. Whole-body retention studies Of 7S-Be HCAT (370 F39q.) using a low background counting system we re performed in order to assess the intestinal function, associated with the bile salt resorpti on (entero-hepatie circulation). The 4th and 7th day retention values were determined in 8 \"controls\" and in 19 patients, affected by non alcoholic cirrhosis (5), terminal ileum resection (S), Crohn's disease (2), ulcerative colitis (1),alcoholic liver clrrhosis (4) and liver ate athosis (4). Counting tecP~iques were described elsewhere (A. Centi~olella et al.,J.Nucl.Med. All.Sol. 27,4,1983) . In seven subjects retention curves were performed and were 8nalyzed by a general-purpose best fit program. NozTnal subje~ ts showed a noticeable variability of the reten tion values at 7th day (30,5%, range 13,8~42,4 %), althoug lower than those reported by others. The 4th and 7th day values differentiate \"norma is\" from patients affected by severe Crohn's di sease (5,0% at the 7th day). No significant di~ ferenee was observed between \"normals\" and non alcoholic cirrhotic patients. These patients showed lower retention values (20,2%) than those from patients with alcoholic cirrhosis (33,5 %). In patients affected by liver steathosis the 7th day retention seems higher (47,4%) than the corresponding no~nal mean value. The use of 75-SeHCAT seems ~afe simple and useful in order to assess the resorptio~ of the terminal il~ um. T~e results On liver disease suggest that it is possible to differentiate by this method non alcoholic from alcoholic liver diseases.",

Sucra!fate powder was mixed with other components and packed in monodose vials. The 99mTo-sucralfate complex was formed by adding I-4 mCi pertechnetate into the vial. After incubation~ the suspension was given orally to the patient. Preliminary trials for label-li~ efficiency and in vivo-stability were made in rats. Imaging in the am. projection of the ventricle was started 20 minutes after administration. Other projections were used when necessary. Endoscopic verification was used to confirm our findings I-2 days before or after the sucralfate study. Results:According to our animal studies, direct labelling'method without HSA offered a stable 99mTc-sucralfate product. After oral administration only little sucralfate is usually absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In normal patients 99mTc-sucralfate passed along the ventricle and duodenum to the small intestine in 90 minutes. Only minimal activity was seen in the ventricle one hour after ingestion. In the case of ulcer, localized activity was seen in the area of the ventricle and duodenum. The decrease of activity was markedly slower than in normal patients. Optimal images were obtained between I-2 hours after ingestion. Good agreement was achieved between imaging and endoscopic results.Conclusions 99mTc-sucralfate suspension seemed to have in vivo-stability.According to our preliminary results 99mTc-sucralfate offers a method to visualize peptic ulcers. It is well known that with esophageal pHmetry it is difficult to identify bile GERs(pH > 7) and it is also impossible to distinguish GERs of bile mixed with acid juice. To study these kinds of GERs we me dified the seintigraphie technique used for detecting duodenogastric bile reflux In a series of 5 patients who underwent partial gastric resection (3 Billroth II and 2 Billreth I) with moderate-severe esophagitis and without significant pH metric test variations,we administered i.v. 5 mCi(185 MBq)of 99mTc-HIDA,the pa tient lying under a computer-assisted gamma camera.When gallbladder image was evident(15-45 min after injection),Caert ! lein was infused i.v. at a dose of 2 ng/ kg/min for 15 min to induce gallbladder contraction.During the subsequent 45 min the patient was asked to perform a sta_n dard series of manoeuvres to facilitate GER.Time/activity curves obtained from areas of interest corresponding to stria remnant and distal esophagus she wed that in each patient at least one of these manoeuvres was followed by a peak in the esophageal curve,indicating a 99 mTe-HIDA-tagged bile GER. In conclusion, as this test gave positive results in pa tients in whom esophageal pHmetry failed diagnostic aim,we believe that HIDA-GER dynamic seintigraphy may be useful in d l secreting the biliary origin of an es~ phagitis. The egg meal for gastric emptying studies is generally labelled by 9g-m-To radiopharmaceutical$ Aim of this paper is to introduce a method for labelling the egg white by lll-In.400 uCi of i!I In-oxine in 50 ml saline has been mixed whit 3ml of fresh egg white.A second dose of 200 uCi of lll-ln-oxine was injected trougththe egg shell by a 23 gauge needle, without crashing the yolk. The sa~e tecnique was ergployed to mix 99-~n-Te sulfur colloid, 99-m-To mierospheres and 99-m-To ovalbumin to the egg.20 minutes later the mixture was tested by G 25 sephadex column chromategraphy and by 9% glycine gel eleetrophoresis,pr~ viously set by fibrinogen, human serum albumin (HSA) and ovoalbu~Jn (OA).Dhl~omatography and ale ctrophoresis indicated that more than 96% of the radioactivity is bound to high weight proteins having eleetrophoretie motility close to that of fibrinogen;S.7% is bound to lighter proteins wi~h an eleotrophoretic motility near to HSA and 0A; finally the 0.16% is due to free lll-ln.The ant! re eggs were cooked and sliced.Slices were imaged by a ganrna-camera.Images of the egg slices demostrated an homogeneous tag of the egg white and no actfvity in the yolk,whereas images of sl~ cos of eggs tagged by 99-~-Tc r~diopharmaeeu~cals showed a strongly unhomogeneous distribution of the 99-m-Tc inside the egg.The results suggest that the ill-In tags the egg white proteins,providing an easy to perform solid meal marker. It has been obtained an homogeneous and high yeld label.",

            "text": "gha.i.r ef Nuclear Medicine, Institute of Radiology, University \"Ls Sapienza\", 00161 Rome, Italy We have studied the gastric emptying in 12 patients(mean age 35 and range 26-60 years)after Nissen fundoplication repair of sliding hiatus hernia and 13 normal subjects(mean age 32 and range 27-40) after ingesting a solid meal(two scrambled eggs labelled with 1 mCi of 99mTc-SC). In the first group of 12 patients the study was performed in basal conditions and repeated one week later after intravenous injection o\u00a3 i0 mg of Domperidone immediately after meal @dmnistrarich. The data collections were carried out by large field gamma-camera (SELO GANMA-CAT) on line wdth Digital Computer PDP-II; 60 seconds frames everg 15 minutes for 3 hours, using a 64x64 maatrix in word mode. The T i/2 and the percentage values in the various times were estimated on the total gastric area after flecay correction. The T i/2 in the healthy patient~ was 90 minutes \u00b1 8(SD) with range 45-125. The T 1/2 in 12 patients was 130 ~ IO(SD)(p O01) Only 8 patients who had a delayed T 1/2 showed a significant reduction of this parameter after Domperidone. On the other hand no significant variations ~ere seen in the 4 patients with normal T i/E. Several radiopharm~ceutical isotopes have been introduced for measuring gastric emptying rates. Tc 99 m sulfur colloid incorporated in small R pieces of filter paper and coated with Perspex has been acted as a marker of solid component in the meal. Kolestyramine is an anion exchanging polysterin resin, the ability of which to bind Tc pertechnetate has not been tested earlier. We studied the stability of Tc-Fiperspex and Tc-Kolestyr in gastric juice of two different ph (below two and above six) in vitro at 37C for three hours. Tc-Fi-Perspex was prepared by impregnating the filter paper (3 mm x 30 ms) with a total of 200 uc of Tc 99m sulfur colloid, a minimum of which was in noneolloid form. After drying the paper was dipped in a 3 ~ w/v solution of Perspex in chloroform, dried, redipped and dried again. The filter paper was then cut imto 30 pieces (I mm x 3 mm) Tc-Kolestyr. was prepared\u2022 by mixing I g kolestyramlne (Questran) in 15 ml aqua with 250 uc Tc pertechnetate for ten minutes. During the inkubations, Tc-Fi-Perspex released radioactivity 20 ~ when ph in gastric juice was below two and 5~when ph was above six. Tc-Kolestyr released radioactivity 0.7 ~ and 0.5 ~ respectively. Our results show that a great amount of radioactivity is eluated from Tc-Fi-Perspex in gastric juice. Te-Kolestyr, however, remained stable in gastric juice the stability being over 99 ~-The similar good ability of other polysterin resins to bind technetium has been also noted in earlier tests. Tc-Kolestyr, easily prepared radionuclide complex, appears to be suitable for a semisolid marker of a meal in gastric emptying studies. An essential step for deciding supra selective vagotomy and controlling its efficacy, or for diagnosing unfrequent gollinger-Ellison syndrome is the estimation of basal and stimulated acid output. This is classically performed through gastric aspiration before and during continuous perfusion of Pentagastrin (6 ugr/Kg B.W./hr). 9~nTc Pertechnetate is taken up by the gastric mucosa either by parietal cells or mucus cells but controversial results have been published. It has been proposed as an alternative method for estimating acid secretion. The present paper describes an original method for calculating gastric Pertechaetate clearance by simultaneous measurements of gastric uptake and plasma concentration with a scintillation camera connected with an all purpose mini computer with visually controlled ROI selection. In all cases studied, the gastric equivalent plasma space shows the same typical time evolution and the clearance may be easily calculated from its initial rate of change. In preliminary studies, classification into normal and duodenal ulcer patients was based on endoscopic examination. Gastric Pertechnetate clearance was significantly higher in duodenal ulcer patients (62,4 ml/min + 27 vs. 27,9ml/min ! 9,6 in normals). Incrnased clearance is observed after Pentagastrin stimulation, while decreased clearance is observed with Cimetidine. Our results suggest a similar trend for gastric aspiration results and Pertechnetate clearance values. If further studies demonstrate an adequate correlation between these two parameters, our simple and non aggressive method would advantageously replace a time cons~uing and uncomfortable e.vploration.",

We have studied 65 liver-lung radionaclide scm~s using respectively Tc-99m-colloid and Te-99m-MAA. The study concerned 3 ~oups of patients. The seintigraphic results have been compared to the su~-gical abdemtual exploration in the first group, to the combined results of abdom/~al ultrasound and C'f scan in the second group, and to the considered final dia~osis assessed by clinical examlretion, radiologica! and biological investigations and the evoluzion in the third group. The images were interpreted as positive when there was separation between liver and lung activity in anteriorandri~ht lateral views and when the upper part of the right lobe was normal on Tc-99m-eolloid imaging. Chest x-ray was available in 61 patients; it has been useful to confi~ the presence of lesions in the right pulmonary base. Among the 28 patients of the first group, 22 ~md normal radionuclide scan and no subdiapl~rag~atic abscess, 4 had subdiaphragmatic abscess also evidenced by the scintigraphy. One patient had a positive scan and an hydatic cyst at the liver dome with a fistula through the diaphra~. In the last patient has been found a massive subcapsular hematoma of liver with rupture. The scintigraphy was negative. In the second group of 12 patients, li had negative scan and no subphrenlc collection showed by ultrasound and CT scan. In one patient who had pneumonia in the lower part of the right lung, the scan was falsely positive. In the ~hird group of 25 patients, 24 had negative scan and no subdiap~u~agm~tic abscess. In the last patient who bad surinfeeted right pleural fluid, the scan was falsely positive. Despite the relative weak prevalence, these results confirm the usefulness of the radionuelide scan for the detection of right subphrenic abscess. Rout~e chest and abdominal x-ray films should be available when evaluating liver-lung scan images. Gastroesophageal reflux in children has been implicated in various respiratory recurring diseases.

In the vaccination program HBV marker-negative pe~ sons were included to avoidNBV infection and its sequelae. The response to the vaccine was confined to the novo appearance of anti-HBs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 86 subjets has been vaccinated. The elegilibity criteria were the follow ing: no pregnancy; no systemic disease; willing hess to receave the vaccine and negative HBV mar kers that is: HBsAg, HBeAg, anti-HBe, anti-HBc and anti-HBs detected by radloinmunoassay. To check the vaccine response these markers were tested again seventh month after the former inye~ tion of vaccine. The vaccine used in the trial was a 1-ml, 40 ug dose of purified HEsAg. The first inyection was given as soon as the results of the screening blood test were avaible, the s~ cond one month later and the third six month af ter the first. P~SULTS: There were dropout among the vaccinate d subjets, one of them because pregnancy and the other employer becouse of a job change, so they were not includen in the analysis. 75 of the 84 vaccine recipients (89.28%) responded to the vaccine with appearance of anti-HBs alone. 5 (5.95% of the vaccinated subjets failed to respond to the vaccine withought developing any HBV markers.

In order to achieve sensible savings in health care, both \"customer and client\" need to be made aware of the major factors which determine cost and effec~ iveness. It is, therefore, desirable that a radiographer/technician is made aware of the overall costs of in vivo nuclear medicine procedures and, in particular, understands the break-down of costing which ultimately explains the value of one particular diagnostic test when compared with an alternative approach. Whilst diagnostic efficacy cannot be judged by the radiographer/ technician in isolation, his awareness of the diagnostic process in general, competing techniques and costs can only improve the overall understanding and utilization of the diagnostic methods concerned.",

This prospective study was performed to compare the value of 2 noninvasive diagnostic modalities Pd~V and 2DE in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) for both the primary localization, extent and hemodynamic consequences as well as for prognostic follow up. In 17 patients (mean age 55.2 yrs, range 38-72 yrs} with EOGdocumented MI BNV and 2DE were performed in an average of 5, ~8 and I05 days after the acute event. Both RNV and 2DE were scored visually by 2 experienced observers, blinded to the clinical and ECG findings, for location and extent of regional wall motion abnormaIities (RWMA), global ventricular function and the time course of these parameters. Results: In 7 patients with large infarcts (5 ant., i lot., t post.) primary location and the individual time course were recoqnized by both RNV and 2DE identically. In 4 patients (2 small ant., i intramural, t inf. MI) RWMA were seen with 2DE only, whereas in another 2 patienms only BNV succeded in detecting RWMA. In Z patients with intramural Mr, both R~V and 2DE slightly dislocated RWMA. In 2 patients with small inferior infarctions both methods failed. In addition ~o the target findings RNV revealed in 6 of 15 patients exercise induced RWMA, whereas 2 DE stud\u00b1as demonstrated a small pertcordial effusion in 4 patients, endocardial thro~g3i in 5 patients, and in i patient a papillary dysfunction could be verified. In conclusion, in large MI both RNV and 2DE are of almost equal diagnostic value, and it is this patient group that needs follow up studies for prognostic and therapeutic considerations. In smaller infarcts, however, both diagnostic modalities should rather be used complementary. We developed a computerized single cardiac-probe system combined with echocardiogram which permits the physician to position the probe more easily and properly.",

Thus, the time interval in which GAB has to occur, in order to he detectable, is very short.

The data were expressed as a fraction of maximum activity and a half-time (T\u00bd) of emptying calculated. Gastric emptying of the solid meal in normals was linear with a T\u00bd of 13-59 minutes. Nineteen preoperative patients had normal gastric empty-in~, i was rapid, 1 very delayed, and 5 borderline delayed. Half the patients showed a latent period of emptyin~ or a delayed peak. In the 2-year postoperative group, 7 had good results (>60% excess weight loss), and 5 had satisfactory results (40% -60% loss). There was strong direct correlation between pouch size, T\u00bd pouch emptying, and percent of excess weight loss. The S patients with enlarged pouches had the most dramatic weight loss. We conclude that the AGES appears eo be an extxemely valuahle test for menitorin8 gastroplasty patients and may provide clues to the physiology of weight reduction i~ these patients. Because of the high correlation between pouch T\u00bd and weieht loss in successful postoperative patients, the most useful aspect of this test may be in differenti&ti~ the reasons for failure of weight loss, i.e., inadequate surgery [short T\u00bd) versus patient overeatin~ (normal or prolonged T\u00bd). There is no definite ~vidence that abnormalities of gastric emptying play a role in the etiology of excessive obesity. Esophageal functional scintigraphy (EFS) assessing both the esophageal transit and the gastroesophageal reflux proved to be a sensitive,quantitative and noninvasive screening test for esophagus dysfunction. However, since bolus composition has some effect on the emptying of the esophagus, the only use of liquids may be questionable. Therefore we tried to determine whether the transit rate of so]Jd food furnishes additional information about the fuectLonal state of the esophagus. Patients and methods: 70 consecutive patents referred for suspected esophageal dysfunction uederwent EFS after swaltowing f~rstly 15 ml of water m~xed with 5 MBq TC-99m-DTPA and then a two centimeter cube of identically labelled b~scuit. The results were expressed as 10 sec clearance (%) and transit time (sec) respectively. The reflux test was performed according to the method described by FISHER et at (Gastroenterology 70:301,1976) . Results: 30 % of the patients showed normal, 27 % patho-logica~ transit of both the liquid and the solid. 20 % bad a regular clearance of ]iqu~d but ae impaired evacuation of the solid bolus. The inverse was found in 23 % of the cases. The mean reflux index of the groups of patients w~th discrepant results was 6,0 + 2,6 % and 9,2 + 5,0 % respectively. When considering only patients without suspected or proven collagen disease, chronic duodenal ulcer was more frequent in the former group (7/9) and reflux disease w~th hiatal hernia in the latter (6/8 Panoreaticoduodenectomy with pylorus preservation (Lon<ymixe) has been recently p~oposed for the surgical treatment of disorders related to the exoerine pancreas. 23 patients (pts) submitted to surgery because of periampullar or pancreatic cancer (14 pts), or chronic pancreatitls (9 pts) were followed for 6-24 months, to assess the presence of BGR and of its effect on the gastric mucosa. A computerized T-camera was used to record the data upon injection of 99mTc-Dietbyl-IDA, with the pt in the rect~bent position (90 frames in 90 min). The gastric area had been preliminarly memorized by making the pt to drink a trace dose of 99mTc-DTPA (O.t mCi in 200 ml milkshake); this was then subtx&cted as the background from the eholescintigraphic images. The activity/ time function in the gastric area was ~en deter~ mined, and BGR was calculated as the percent of maximu~ counts over the main biliary ducts which entered the gastric area per min. BGR was detected in ~2 pts, being persistent and relevant (over 2%/min) in 3 pts only. Upper G.I. endoscopy excluded the presence of gastric ubcers in all pts; 7 pts with obvious BGR had histologic signs of chronic superficial gastritis on multiple antral hiopsles (only a few out of these 7 pts had slight scattered antral mucosa hyperemia at macroscopic examination during endoscopy). This study supports the functional validity of the proposed surgical proceducce, and indicates that in some cases BGR may develop, possibly leading to histologic signs of chronie gastritis, whose long-te~moutcome deserves further studies.",

In|tial preliminary phantom and isolated clinical case studies have shown artifactual falsepositive perfusion defects and image distortions with 180 \u00b0 acquired images. The present study was performed to verify if previous findings were reproducible with other imaging systems and reconstruction as well as to determine the effect on short-axis orientation, in addition, the effect of attenuation corrections of the two techniques on normg| and abnormally per~ fused myocardium was evaluated. Normal patients and patients with myocardial ischemia and infarction diagnosed on 360 \u00b0 acquired images were confirmed by coronary angiography and reprocessed for the 180-360 \u00b0 comparison. Each patient was processed twice, first with data from 0 e (ANT) to 180 \u00b0 (POS) then with data acquired from 315 o (RAO) to 1350 (LPO). Reconstructions were displayed and reinterpreted blindly without knowledge of the patient's diagnosis. The present study confirmed that 180 o acquired images produce significant falsepositive defects and image distortion in patients with normally perfused myocardium. The false defects were accentuated by the attenuation correction program. The 180 o acquired data also produced prominent streaking artifacts which were not seen on the 360 \u00b0 acquired images. Although the contrast resolution of the 180 \u00b0 acquired images was better for infarcts compared to the 360 \u00b0, the display of ischemic redistribution pattern was more accurate on the 360 \u00b0, This study reiterates our previous preliminary conclusion that the reconstruction of 180 \u00b0 acquired data is not sufficiently reliable for Thallium-201 myocardial SPECT imaging. Since the NMR signal from flowing blood is usual|y much weaker than the surrounding cardiac structures, NMR cardiac imaging has the advantage of an inherent contrast agent that serves to delineate the chamber wa]Is and valvular structures. The advantages of this contrast cannot be achieved, however, if measuremeets of the heart are made at various positions or states of motion. If the pulse sequence is synchronized to be initiated at a specific point in the R-R interval, the heart motion would not affect the image. This synchronization, or gating, has been accomplished both by using the electrical spike of the Rwave as a reference point or by detecting the shape of the arteria] pulse by means of pressure detection devices. The latter technique is simpler and cheaper but is more difficult to synchronize with the diastolic phase. Gated cardiac NMR measurements provide the only technique avai|able to image the heart in all planes and at any or all phases of the cardiac cycle. Cinematic display of a cross-section has been accomplished so that a~sessment of valve movement, ventricular function amd wall motioe can be achieved. App|icatioes have already been made for the identification of infarcts and congenital malformations. Assessment of ventricular wall thickness in left ventricular hypertrophy has been obtained. Since these cardiac images have only recently been available to the cardiologist, it is expected that many other cardiac applications will be used in the future for both diagnosis and patient handling. 39 patients were studied for chest pain (56%), symptomatic heart fealure (54%), both symptoms (23%), syncope (7%). All had impaired left ventrieular function estimated with echocardlography or left angiography and all but one had no significant coronary stenosis. With a rotating y-camera (GE 4OCT) 32 views of 3Os each were c~lected, from LPO to RAG. Using a filtered backprojection algorithm, lO to 20 transverse 6.25rm~ thick slices were reconstructed, from which coronal and sagittal sections were obtained.",

TS was performed after symptom-limited bicycle exercise (2 mCi i.v., Ii pts) or after dipyridamole-induced vasodilatation (6mg/kg). In ~/6 pts with PMD and 2/6 pts with SMA, 1 pt with F, myocardial defects were found in TS. VF was normal in all pts except the pt with DC~ who had typical TS and US findings. The CAD-pt had an inferior defect in TS. 2 pts with P~D and normal TS were significantly younger compared to P~D-pts with ~ pathologic TS (mean age 22 vs. ~ y)~ indicating progressive heart involvement in advanced PMD. No significant age difference was observed in 2/6 pathologic vs. 4/6 normal SMA pts. In eonclusion~ TS revealed pathological findings in about 2/3 of PMD and 1/3 of S~& pts suggestive for heart involvement of the p~imary disease. Age distribution of pMD-pts with p~thologic TS indicated progressive heart involvement in advanced stage. Follow-up studies are needed to substantiate these findings. 23 patients(pts) who underwent a coronary bypass operation were studied pre-and postoperatively with stress and redistribution TI-201 SPECT. Stress imaging was started within ten minutes after a maximal stress test, Tl-chloride was injected 1 min before the end of the stress, Redistribution images were taken 4 hours later. Imaging was performed with a MaxiCamera 400T equipped with Gamma-t1 computer system and SPETS tomographic software.",

In 7 patients there where no defects in thallium 201 images, .12 subjects showed regional perfusion defects in images recorded immediately after exercise and 2 of them kept these, alterations in late images. During exercise monitoring episodes of ST d@ pression were recorded in 13 patients, in 2 of them there ~'as angina too. Two subjects had negative exercise electrocar diograms during stress Thallium-201 imaging. Many authors judge that Thallium-201 is more specific than stress electrocardiogram alone i~ the evaluation of coronary disease. We think that with the association of exercise electrocardiogram ahd stress Thallium-201 imaging in symptomatic patients it is possible to single out true myocardial ischemia despite of normal coronary angiography. The aim of this study was to develope a routine computer program for use in cardiac stress studies with Thallium~201. By using the available software Of the integrated Elscint camera (Apex 215M) the final program consists of acquisition in a 25Bx256 matrix during g minutes after injection of 2 mCi (7a Mbeq) of Thallium-g01 in S standard projections. A circular BOI is created around the left ventricle and after background substraction an angular profile is produced. By using the same ROI in the rest study after redistribution (4 hours p.i.) a second angular profile is produced. The rest-histogram is substracted from the stress-histogram and the washout curve is calculated by dividing this histogram by the stress-histogram. The wash-out histogram is divided into 7 segments and the quantitative wash-out is calculated for each segment The wash-out histograms of 30 cardiac patients (15 women and 15 men) without proven angina pecfurls were used to calculate the average washout profile and the standard deviation for women and men separately. Ii An attempt has been made to correlate pathological wash-out results with coronair angiograpby findings. In relation to visual interpretation this program proved to be very useful in previous myocardial infarction patients. In a further development the computer automatically calculates the extent of the hygoperfused area in the stress study as well as the area of diminished wash-out from the wash-out profile. The severity of the lesion is also calculated and expressed in terms of standard deviations in both instances.",

A se~-~titative score of ~docardial thallit~n uptake was expressed as a percent of a maximal defect score (DS -+ gEM). At rest, DS were similax in both groups (21% -+4 in C and 19%_+3 in SKi . During exercise, DS increased in both groups to a similax level (29%-+4 in C, 31%!3 in SK) . Patients with reperfusion were pooled (23 pts = 17 successfull SK and 6 C in which the infarct related vessel was patent) and c~ed with pts without reperfusion (Ii pts = io C with an occluded vessel and one SK failure). Patients with reperfusion had DS at rest significantly lower than those without reperfusion (14%_+3 and 32%_+5 ; p < O.001) , but during exercise, DS of non reperfused patients did not change significantly (TLR 32% _+5 to TL max 36%_+5) whereas DS of reperfused patients increased n~rkedly (TLR 14%_+3 to TL max 27%+_4 ; p < O.(~31). In conclusion, 6 weeks after AMI, patients with reperfusion have a saklller DS at rest but during exercise, the reperfused area beoccaes reversibly ischemic and requires further rm~nagea~nt. We investigated 13 P with suspected or documented femoral head necrosis of idiopathic or traumatic origin. The lesions known from radiographs could be visualized by NMR at least as well, whereas their 3-dimensional extent was superiorly demonstrated on additional orthogonal NMR t~ogra~s. ~n 6 P with idiopathic necrosis, NMR revealed envolve~ent of the sontralateral side unknown before. Pathology was documented best using IE1200/400/30 mode and with reduced contrast on SE500/30 images, whereas many lesions were missed using SE1500/60 and SEI500Y120 sequences. 14 P with bone tumors or metastases were investigated. Due to prolonged TI times, malignancy presented with reduced signal intensity on IE1200/400/30 images or was highlighted on IE1200/I00/30 images. In 6 P with radiographisally silent lesions, hone scintigraphy revealed pathology without discriminating malig-naney~ degeneration or trauma, whereas NMR contributed essentially to the final diagnosis. The intervertebral discs were studied in 15 P with known degeneration and in 25 controls. NMR revealed 38 degenerated discs in 27 P, characterized by a reduced proton density and shortened TI and T2 times. Normal and diseased discs were best distinguished by SEI000/60 and IE1200/30/30 modes. 0nly once a prolaps could be confirmed. According to these preliminary results, NMR seems to be the best imaging modality in early diagnosing femoral head necrosis and can be useful in differential diagnosis of various pathologies of the skeletal system. Six patients with proven disc space infection underwent bose scanning with 9Tb~q Tc-9~n ~DP together with NMR in.zing on a 0.6T superconducting magnet to obtain weighted Tl(30mSec Te .3 Sec TR) and T2(120mSec TE 3 Sec TR) images within a 48 hr. period. All patients had plain radiographic evaluation of the areas involved. Three pts. had C~-67 Citrate scans using 222MBq activity following the bone scan and 1 patient had CT imm~es of the involved area. All 6 bone scans showed increased bony uptake in at least the adjacent vertebral end plates but did not show any abnormal uptake in the region of the disc. Bony activity distribution was non-specific snd could have been consistent with either degenerative or osteomyelitic change. Gallium imaging in one case supported the latter diagnosis but did not indicate presence of disc space involvement. Two other cases showed bony involvement to the extent of the bone scan; one showing minimal uptake due to antiobiotie therapy. Plain radiographs were suggestive of disc space infection in all cases. ~ in all cases revealed marked disc space and adjacent bone involvement to the extent shown on bone scans. T1 and T2 weighted images appeared highly specific for either infection or degenerative change and were unaffectedby antibiotic therapy. ~ appears to be more sensitive in evaluation fo disc space infection than radionuclide studies. NMR is also able to provide significant auatomic information involving thecal sac and neural structures. Nuclear medicine studies appear equally sensitive though less specific in the evaluation of bone involvement except perhaps where antibiotic therapy has been used. Scintigraphy with 99mTc-DPD is a sensitive method for detecting osseous lesions but it is unspecific; malignant neoplasms cannot be differentated from benign conditions. We have compared Tc-DPD and FDO images in 4 adult patients and I dog with different skeletal tumors in order to study whether FDG adds specificity. Onehour dynamic FDG and Tc-DPD images were performed using a conventional ~amma camera suitable for detection of 8F. FDG was administered iv (0.5-2.5 mCi). Resuits: The Tc-DPD images were positive in all studies except in a patient with benign cortical sclerosis. The FDG images were positive in the patients with histiocytoma and osteomyelitis and the dog with osteosarcoma, and negative in the patients with chondrosarcoma gr I and benign cortical sclerosis. Conclusions: It has been stated (I) that FDG does not accumulate into inflamed tissue, and so it was surprising to find high FDG uptake in the patient with osteomyelitis. It does, however~ appear that in cases of true malignancy of the bone FDG measures the degree of malignancy: The chondrosarcoma gr I~ a semimalignant neQplas~ did not accumulate FDG while the aggressive histiocytoma and osteosarcoma did. In this sense, FDG seems to add specificity to the diagnosis of osseous lesions found in conventional bone scintigraphies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of MDP vs. DPD in 20patlents with various pathologies.",

We have shown that the quality of bone image obtained depends highly on the nature of the diphosphonate and of the reducing agent. By studying the effect of different variables on the quality of image, we were able to establish the conditions under which high lesion-to-bone and bone-to-soft tissue radioactivity ratio can be obtained. The nature of Tc-99m species in various preparations was examined chromatographically and electrophoretically. The optimal formulation for the three diphosphonates and the bone image obtained from them will be presented. The mechanism of Tc-99m uptake in bone will be discussed. The advantages of uncemented prosthesis in the treatment of femoral head necrosis have increased its application in re cent years, the evol~tive orthopedic co L trol having become necessary for an early detection of the most frequent eompl~ cations. Bone gammagraphy with 99m phoaphated complexes is of great usefulness to follow the evolution of such patients. Twentyfive patients, with a diagnosis of femoral head necrosis and treated surgically by u~cemented prosthesis (Mittelmeier), have been studied. The radionuelide used was 99mTc-MDP in dosis of 555 MBq and the detection system a gammacamera connected in line to a PDP-I1 computer which allows the activity to be c~ fleeted. In all cases, the gammagraphic recording of pelvis a/id femurs was obtained t~ee hours after the administration of the ra dionu\u00a2lide and the quantitative study o~ the bone uptake in the compute~ by sele~ ring the area of interest and obtaining the indices relating the areas close to the prosthesis ~ith simila~ oontralateral areas. The abnormal deviations of the ratios obtained from the control group, has enabled us to determine abnormal postoperative activity which, in our series, persists even six months after the prosthesis has been implanted~ and have shown the reliability of gammagraphy to follow the evolution of these patients. TeHSm-MDP (15mCi) bone-scan were performed in the whole group in the first weeks following surgery (m=20d). Six patients had an additional follow-up scan at 60-90 days after the first one. All 17 scans revealed uptake of the tracer in the graft. Although several papers concerning bone grafts demonstrated poor or absent tracer uptake in nonvaseularized bone grafts, in our experience, the freeze-dried bone implants showed early significant bone tracer uptake. Further investigations are needed to clarify possible mechanisms of early tracer uptake in homoplastic bone grafts. In 30 patients (pt.) (20 M/10 F, mean age 62.3 yr.) diagnosed of multiple myeloma (MM) according to the criteria of the Leukemia-Myeloma Task Force, a bone scintigraphy (BS) with 99m-To-MOP and a radiological study (XN) of the skeleton were performed at the time of diagnosis. Localized images of increased uptake on the BS were compared to XR lesions of osteolysis, pathologic fractures and vertebral compression fractures.",

The results will be used in further investigations of therapy for hemarthrosis. The effect of various egg whites on bone uptake of 45Ca in rats was investigated. The radioactive calcium was administered by orogastric intubation (2 uCi/100 g.b.wt.) without or with 1.0 ml of egg white to female Hooded rats fasted for 24 h. Twenty-four h. following the intubation of 45Ca all rats were sacrificed with chloroform and the right femur of each rat was: removed for radioactive content measured hy standard techniques. The results were as follows: (a) the control group of rats showed 78 muCi per g. fresh hone; (h) the group with hen's egg white 47 muCi 45CA per g. fresh bone (p<0.01); (e) the group with black duck's egg white 51 muCl 45CA per g. hone (p~0.01); (d) the group with Toulouse goose's egg white 61 muC~ 45Ca per g. hone (p?0, I) non significant; (e) the group with Australian emu's egg white 31 mute 45Ca per g. bone (p(O.001); and the group with Egyptian ostrich egg white 51 muCl 45 Ca per g. bone (p(0.05). It is known that a high uptake of radioactive fallout so dangerous a phenomenon of nuclear warfare. These results suggest that various egg white might he applied as preventives in case of a nuclear war. Irradiation of heed and neck region by high doses has a tendency to induce dental end periodontal damage and infections. [<andibuler osteomyelitis amd osteoradioneerosis ere feared complications. The early rsdiologieal detection of this situation is difficult. We have evaluated scintizrsphio possibilities by studing the ehan@es of mandibular scintigrephy under radiation therapy. 28 patients were excaminated by 99mTc-YDP before irradiation, after the first part of treatment, after the completion of treatment and 6 -12 months later. All pictures were stored into the memory of computer. The best projection for this study seems to be an ap-projection. Two re~ion of interest (NO!) were selected from every picture: the angle of the irradiated mandible and the middle part of the forehead of the skull. The uptake of the mandible relative to the uptake of the skull were calculated from the net average counts of these ROIs. Then it wee possible to define the changes of the relative uptake of irradiated mandible under the time of normal split-course radiation therapy. On;the basis of the results we eonelu~ that if the patient have some sig~s of radiation reaction in his mouth after the first part of the treatment and the uptake of the mandible in the eeintigraphy is hi~her than normal there is a high risk to get radionecrosis of the mandible after the completion of the whole treatment. A quantitative scintigraphic method was introduced to examine the carpal seaphoid bone.99m-Tc-Sn-phyrophosphate scin cigraphy was obtained by the use of a gamma camera equipped with a pinhole collimator. Regions of interest were placed in the proximal,middle and distal third of the imaged scaphoid,and activities were expressed as fractions of the injected activity. Of six investigated patients in whom a unilateral fresh fracture of the scaphoid was clinically suspected,radiology showed a fracture of the scaphoid in four and no fractures in two.By scintimetry the region corresponding to the location of the radiological fracture had a higher activity than the other two regions in the fractured scaphoid (p<o.125).The smallest gradient of activity between the fractured region and the adjacent regions in the fractured scaphoid was higher than the largest gradient of activity oetween regions in six controls (p<o.ol) In the two scaphoid bones with clinical symptoms and no radiological fractures the regional activities and their differences were within the eiqthy per cent confidence limits of the six symptomless scaphoids.The method may be suitable in early diagnosis of scaphoid fractures with non-diagnostic initial radiographs. The aim of this paper has been to correlate the analitical, ga~unagraphic and radiographic findings in Paget's disease.",

Metastasis disease (bladder and pros_ tate) was reported in 8 patients. It has been diagnosed of Paget's disease 144 patients of the total: Monostotic form 46 (32%) and polyostotic Paget's 98 (68%). Skull location was the most son, non appearence in the monostotic form (14 of 46). Skull (46 of 98) and pelvis (46 of 98) locations were highest incidence in the multifocal Paget's. It has been detected 332 bone lesions: 248 (74%) by radiographic method and 328 by bone scan. The t00% of the monostotic lesions and the 45% (44/98) of the polyostotic were detected both on the ra ~ograph and on the scan; on the radio graph alone 4.08% (4/98) and on the scan alone 51% (50/98). CONCLUSIONS The scan positive and radiograph negative areas in polyostotic form represent ea ~y Paget's le sions, therefore bone scan must be utilized to evaluate the extent of the disease in the skele ton. Althought neither method alone detect all lesion, the bone scan are more sensitive. The paliative therapy of the pain resulting from bone metastases in cases of the generalized prostatic carcinoma, based on the use of 89 Sr~-radiati0n, was employed in 14 patients, Those were 19 individuals with generalized metastases add remarkable pains, which limited the mobility and disturbed sleeping, and I patient, where the therapy was applied as a prevention, still at a time without manifest pains. The metastatic involvement was demonstrated by s seintigraphis method, using 99m Tc-pyrophosphata. Prior to the therapeutic application of 89 S~, the accumulation of gr in metastatic lesions was tested by the prophilographY using 85 Sr. In nine patients, there was a positive effect of the therapy, characterized by a moderation or even disappearing of the pains with an improved mobility and sleeping in eight patients for 1-4 month, in one patient for 16 month. The }addence of hematological complications following intracavkary radioyttr}am therapy was evaluated in 23 patients with malignant effusions. 11 patients died 5 days up to 420 days, 10 are alife 60 days up to 570 days after treatment. 3 patients died wit}an 1 month.

The udnary excretion of Y-90 during 48 hours after edminlstration ranged from 0.007 to 0.02%D/1 in patients wHhout hematological complications, while it was 0.83%D/1 in a patient who developed PCP 3 weeks later. Post-mortem tissue assays were performed in a patient who died 4 weeks after intrapleuml (]eft side) administration of 3.7 GBq colloidal Y~90 without evidence of FCP. The calculation of the absorbed energy doses yielded the following results: left pleura 10380 tad, left lung 50 red, right lung 12 tad, liver 40 tad. spleen 50 red, red marrow 12 tad.

A new software package for easy visualization of mult~le slices with anatomical identffication facilitates the demonstration of clinical data durinf staff meetings. 180 \u00b0 data collection has been mostly used in T1-2RI grEET studies of heart, since heart is located anteriorly in the left chest so that it seems reasonable to believe that more events are acquired with 180 \u00b0 sampling (RAO to LPO} than in the opposite Ig0 \u00b0 (LPO to RAO). In addition, 180 \u00b0 sampling has been used in some other SPECT studies when, for example, the lesion has been located in a particular non-central region of the body. In such situations 180 \u00b0 scans have better les]on's image contrast than 360 \u00b0 scans, because of lower background activity. Thus if [he main clinical question is relatively simple such as: is there a lesion or not, then 180 \u00b0 sampling may be better than the 360 \u00b0 one, especially if the lesion is located far from the center of the slice picture. Also, sampling time is twice shorter in 180 \u00b0 studies. The disadvantage of 180 \u00b0 data collection is that attenuation correction For 180 o sampling has not yet been developed and evaluated. Also in such studies it is not possible to make opposite views averaging and in the reconstructed images there is a geometrical distortion mainly due tO variable spatial resolution with distance from the camera. Tomographic scans have been performed using a large-field-of-view hamma camera (GE400T). 64 views over 360 \u00b0 , providing sampling For every 5.6 \u00b0 of revolution of the detector, have been stored as 64x64 matrix each in the POP 11/34 computer. Transverse sectional images have been reconstructed by means of o~n software based on filtered backprojection algorithm, which enables to change start angle in 180 \u00b0 studies (in heart studies start angle is usually 225 o) and thus providing to use only 32 successive views with the desired first one. Our results indicate that in some SPECT studies, especially in the lungs SPECT studies geometrical distortion can be significant and if SPECT study is used for lesion sizing or determination of an actual volume 360 \u00b0 scans should be used.

The list of patient-data ;o be processed is first stored in a special file called \"NAMES\" and at every step the data are processed sequentially : a) a sum of part of the data is performed in order to draw rough ROl's for the right (RV) and left ventricle(LV), b) the computer finds the time-interval for summation for optimal visualisation of RV and LV. Precise ROI's are drawn. A background area is created by shifting the ROl's 3 pixels diagonally to the right and left, and keeping the nonoverJapping crescent, c) the moments of highest ejection velocity are used tei find the cardiac cycles (GORIS). The ejection fraction is computed on a beat by beat basis. Phase and amplitude analysis is then performed on RV and LV separately. A complete report is printed so that the clinician can have a clear rue of the operations performed. Our program allows for the determination of right and left ejection fraction, flow index, maximum ejection velocity.

Since the lines are twice as tong as the width of the lucite block, the images show the sources with and without scattering material. With increasing distance from the collimator, the image quality decreases and the line structure disappears. Thus, the number of lines distinguished by visual inspection is a measure for the spatial resolution in depth. Using a computer and taking a slice through the images, a quantification is possible:the decreasing modulation with increasing distance gives the limit of visibility.

In patients with unilateral renal artery sCenesis (URAS) eaptopril a~ninistration will deteriorate glomerular filtration in the affected kidney possibly by interruption of autoregulatory mechanisms. ~3is effect might be detectable on renography and could be useful for the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension. After discontinuation of all medication, Tc-99m dietbylene triamine pentaaeetic (DTPAi gam3nacamera renography, followed by 1-131 orthoiodohippurate {OIH) renography were performed in il hypertensive patients who were poorly controlled with medical therapy. This double examination was repeated some days later after administration of 25 mg captopril one hour prior to the examination. After this, angiography was done and patients with stenosis of the renal artery were treated by percutaneous transluminal dilatation. Five URAS-patients, in whom the bloodpressure improved after percutaneous transluminal dilatation, showed after administration of captopril a striking renographic alteration in the affected kidney. ~te DTPA-renogram which initially had an upslope phase, showed a blooddisappearance curve and the OIH-zenogram, which still had an upslope phase, showed a slower excretion. These renographic alteration did not occur in the other 2 UP~S-patients, who had no benefit of the percutaneous transluminal dilatation and in the 4 remaining patients without stenosis. These findings suggest that captopril induced renographic alterations may be important for the diagnosis of hemodynamic significant URAS. . those in group A; postoperatlvely Clst increased, Rtst fell significantly. The Rt Q was prolonged early after TLD but norma~lzed later C) Permanent hypertension: for 7 patients there are no preoperative criteria for a discrimination against the other groups. But in all cases Rt did not normalize, and Rt incxeast co sed early after TLD. Even in later examinations Rt rexnained higher than preoperatively. co These results imply that the success of TLD depends mainly on the behavior of the contralateral kidney. A RNG one day after the TLD gives an optimal prognosis concerning the end result. Differential diagnosis of hypertension requires analysis of glomerular filtration and tubular transport. 70 hypertensive patients (16 with renal artery stenosis, 37 with renal parenchyma] disease and 17 with essential hypertension) received 99mTc-DTPA for dynamic renal scintigraphy. 10 individuals without renal disease or hypertension served as controls. Time-activity curves were treated by deconvolution analysis in order to determine global and local renal perfusion (P), extraction fraction (E) and mean transport time (T). The correlation between local P and E permitred distinction from background by correlation coefficient (r) and orthogonality (~) as a function of renal inteqrity. P was significantly reduced in renal artery stenosis. T tended to be prolonged irrespective of the etiology of hypertension, r and indicated better renal function in essential hypertension than in renal artery stenosis. All values and their right to left quotients (R/L), 20 parameters in all, were treated by factor analysis resulting in three groups of correlations, characterizing values of P-E, T and R/Lquotients. The three groups of patients with hypertension could be clearly separated. For example, discriminance analysis identified renal artery stenosis with a sensitivity of 80 Z. The presented method obviously appears to be highly reliable clinically. Renal involvement in essential hypertension has been argued by many authers. In order to refine the diagnostic possibilities using renography for renal involvement in systemic hypertension, we have developed the exercise renography by double dose of Tc-99mDTPA. We report on 38 patients referred for renograpgy, 25 of all patients with essential hypertension, 7 with hypertension and diabetes mellitus, and 6 without hypertension. The rest renogram was obtained in sitting position on the bicycle ergometer and for exercise renogram 30 minutes after ending of the rest renogramhy,second bolus injection of 15 mCi of TC~99mDTPA was done intravenously to the patient during ergometric stressing. In comparing the results of rest renograms with exercise ones, 16 of 32(50%)patients demonstrated abnormal exercise renogram (delayed peak time and TI/2). Exercise caused bilateral renal dysfunction in 1O of 25(40%)patients with essential hypertension and 6 of 7(86%]patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Exercise renograms of all normotensives were normal. Before and after exercising there was not any difference between patients of normal and abnormal renogram in changes of blood pressure and heart rate. These results indicate that there is renovascular hyper-reactivity by stress in systemic hypertension. The exercise renography is a valuable method to estimate renal involvement in systemic hypertension. 99m TC labelled monodisperse millimicroepheres (particle diameter less than I [un) nebulized from an ethanol suspension in a self developed system to deliver a dry aerosol achieved a high lung delivery efficiency of 22%. In 48 patients with chronic obstructive airway diseases (COAD) and in 24 patients with suspected pulmonary e/re bolism, inhalation J/nages were cor~red quantitatively and qualitatively with 81m Kr or 127 Xe ventilation studies. A \"penetration index\" deflaed as the ratio of pixel-normalized counts of an inDer zone to a peripheral zone was calculated for each aerosol-and 81m Kr scan.These penetration indices correlated significantly (r=0.86, p < 0. 001 ) indicating penetration of the millLmicrospheres to the lung periphery com parable to 81m Kr. Four different patterns of aerosol deposition could be observed. An \"aerosol hot spot score\" provides reliable inforn~tion about the degree of airflow obstruction, since a close relationship between the hot spot score and the forced expiratory voltc~e in I s (FEVI) was fo~d in patients with COAD (r=-0.77, p< 0.001). Quantitation of regional ventilation of the upper, middle and ic~r lung fields demonstrated nearly identical results for the aerosol-and 81m Kr images (r=0.88, p<0.001) . Qualitative assessment of aerosol sca~s compared to the radioactive gases showed cor~plete or large agre~t in all but one patient. Ventilation it&aging using a dry aerosol of mDnedisperse milllmicrospberes see~s to be a reliable alternative to radioactive gases for clinical routine examination of patients with suspected pulmonary em~3olism or (]DAD. For patients with O0AD, aerosol imaging is more sensitive than 81m Kr. Radioactive aerosols offer a means for steady state ventilation scanning in multiple views. The clinical use of radioaerosol techniques has been hampered by the lack of delivery systems producing sufficiently small particles. If the aerosol contains large particles, heavy deposition occurs in major airways, especially in patients with airways disease. This may interfere with the interpretation of the scan and the comparison with the perfusion scintigram.",

The muco-ciliary system (MCS) is \u00a3he main mechanism for getting rid of inhaled particles or cellular remains out of the airways. Defection of this system leads to secretion stasis and bronchial obstruction. Alteration of the MCS in bronchitis is well documented but dysfunction of bronchial clearance during different phases of bronchitis has not yet been studied. Radioisotopic techniques provide a good tool for this kind of study. We measured bronchial mucociliary clearance (MC) and clearance by cough using a radioactive aerosol technique (resin particles 7.4~m in diameter, tagged with technetium 99m) in patients with reccurent bronchitis (group I, n = 5) and in chronic bronchitic patients, either at an early (group II, n = 13) or advanced (group III, n = 17) stage of their disease. The results were compared with those obtained from ~ control group (group O, n = ]0) and the respective efficiencies of the mucociliary system and cough were analysed with reference to respiratory function. The initial deposition of the aerosol in central airways is similar in all the patients and healthy subjects. In comparison with group O, the mucociliary clearance is only significantly reduced in groups II and III (p < 0.02). In healthy subjects, the clearance by cough is very weak, whereas in bronchitic patients, it can be roughly equal to or greater than the MC. However, the cough is less efficient in group IlP than in group II (p < 0.05). A reduced efficiency of the clearance by cough occurs together with abnormalities in the gas exchange.",

End diastolic gated images were obtained with TE-3Omsec and TR=R-R interval on the ECG. 6/g pts. showed LV wall thickening J]ieb was concentric and included the septum. Papillary muscles were identified in 8/1 and were enlarged in 3/6. 4/6 pts. showed Y~g wail thickening but to a lesser de~ree than the LV. Pericardial effusions were present in 4 cases. These findings correlated well with the results of echo although MR gave better RV free wall resolution. PYP scans were positive in 3 pts. but there was no correlation with degree of LV thickening. We conclude fhat there are identifiable ~R findings in patients with cardiac AL which encourage f~rther atfen~ts to characterize myocardial involvement by rneasttrer~enf of !@{ relaxation times in rive. Carrier-free 1-123-Tyr-Al4 insulin (I-123-ins) was prepared by reverse phase HPLC chromatography and shown to bind with a high affinity to specific antiinsulin antibodies and to specific insulin receptors.on cultured human IM 9 lyl,phocytes. 1-123-ins was also injected into anesthetized rats and its distribution followed using a scintillation camera connected to a computer. In rive, the tracer was mainly t~ken up by the liver, by specific interaction with insulin receptors on the hepatocytes. Liver time-activity profiles after portal ( mesenteric vein ) or peripheral ( jugular vein ) injection were compared, allowing to calculate that after one single transhepatic passage, the liver extraction coefficient was 61% and the minimt<m transit time of 1-123-ins in the liver was 4.5 min. Past this time, liver radioactivity decreased with a half-life of 6 min. Twenty normal human volunteers gave informed consent, received 2 oral doses of 500 mg potam sium perchlorate and .8 to 1.6 mCi 1-123-ins by antecubital vein injection. The liver was again the main target organ and liver timeactivity curves were comparable to those obtained in rats. 1-123-ins had no effect on blood glucose concentration. Dosimetry calculations showed that the absorbed doses by the thyroid gland, bladder, ovaries, testis and liver respectively were 1,420, 303, 33, 23 and 13 mrad/mCi. It is concluded that at a dose of i mCi, 1-123-ins can safely be used in man to investigate not only disorders of insulin receptor interaction and metabolism but also beRate-cellular diseases sumh as hepatoma.",

This latter disease may be either primary or secondary to intestinal mucosal damage due to acute gastreenteritis or other diseases. Bjarnason et al. recently demonstrated that Cr-5] EDTA could be used to estimate gut permeability in adults. In the present work, we report a preliminary evaluation of this test in normal adults, in children with failure to thrive but no gastrointestinal tract disease (age 0.8 to 12 years) and in children recovering from acute gastroenteritis (aBe 0.2 to 1.4 year) or suffering from eczema (age 0.2 to 4 years). After an 8 hours fast Cr-51EDTA (50 uCi below 6 years of age, 100 uCi above) was administered orally, urinary excretion of radioactivity was measured during the following 24 hours and expressed as percentage of oral dose. Results in adult volunteers and control children were 2.35 + 0.77 % (mean ~ SD) and 2.50 + 0.78 % respectively. By contrast, urinary ex-Cretion of radioactivity was significantly increased in gastroenteritis (range 3.4 -29.6 %) and eczema (range 6.5. -22.8 %). In adult volunteers, absorbed dose to stomach, small bowel, colon, gonads and total body were evaluated at 2.2, 2.7, 35, 3.5 and i mrad/ 100 uCi respectively. We conclude that I. gut permeability to Cr-51 EDTA is the same in control infants and in normal adults. 2. permeability is significantly increased in healing gastreenteritis (p <0.001) and eczema patients (p < 0.001), supporting the hypothesis that increased gut permeability is an important factor in the development of food allergy. 3. provided that renal function is not severely impaired, this simple and non invasive test may be used to assess small bowel integrity in children.

In our experience radionnuclide hepatobiliary imaAinq can be used to d~a~nose hiliary atresia, offerins an accura te and noninvasive method for differentiatingthis disease from neonatal hepatitis. Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) has vastly improved our ability to examine multiple organs which normally overlap in planar images. If the presentation is kidney trauma an IVP will be perfo~ed in the Emergency Room, If the child is suspected of having liver and/or spleen trauma, a five minute kidpey scan will be performed first, if normal, a SPECT liver/spleen study and a continuing kidney study will then be performed. If the child has a head or spinal injury, a CT examination is done of those areas with thick slices of the liver and spleen and kidneys at the time of head or spine CT . This permits the most efficient and cost effective method for the initial evaluation of patients suspected of abdominal trauma. Follow-up liver and spleen studies are primarily done using SPECT. The kidneys are followed up by either intravenous pyelogram, DMSA or 91ucoheptonate kidney scans using SPECT, which allows functional quantitation in the recovery period. In 51 patients suspected of having liver and spleen trauma, planar imaging detected 5 liver and 14 splenic abnormalities whereas SPECT determined 7 liver and 17 splenic abnormali ties. Currently we are using this as part of a prospective study to compare the IVP and kidney scan performed in this manner within 24 hours of injury.",

At the tJ~ne of insertion of the V-P shunt for hydrocephalus a separate ventricular catheter with a Rickham reservoir was placed into the frontal horn of the right lateral ventricle. The reservoir was punctured under aseptic conditions, the pressure measured and a CSF sa/uple taken for culture. One mCi of Tc99m OTPA was then injected. An external standard of ImCi of tracer was drawn up at the same time. Data was collected onto computer for 2 minutes and a ratio of the ventricular counts to standard counts generated. Scans were performed at 2,4,6,20,22 and 24 hours. From these ratios a clearance curve was obtained and evidence of tracer in peritoneal cavity or CSF pathways assessed. Thirty infants were studied over a 5-year period. Serial studies were performed in 24. Twenty cleared tracer rapidly down the shunt and remained either totally or partially shunt dependent. Four (17%) demonstrated proqressively less radionuelide clearance down the shunt with circulation via the basilar cisterns and normal CSF pathways. Ten children had clearance studies to assess patency for diagnosis of shunt malfunction. In 4 obstruction was confirmed at surgical revision. Six patients with normal studies recovered uneventually. This method permits an accurate assessment of drainage of ventricular CSF via the shunt over an extended period and the patency of normal or alternate CSF pathways where the shunt is malfunctioning. With current labelled tt~nour associated monoclonal antibodies, tO/hOUr uptake usually increases with time over a 24 h~ period reaching a maxim-u~ of I to 7\u00b0% of the injected dose. Visual assessment of regions of change is difficult due to a combination of statistical noise, a high backgrotmd activity, complexity of the image and non-congruent image registration. This study presents a statistically based method in which temporal differences between a pair of spatially aligned images are quantitated in terms of a global linesm scaling facto= and a regional map of areas of altered distribution expressed in terms of probability. Alignment of the images is achieved with the aid of 5 radioactive markers which a~e accurately superimposed on skin marks for each recorded image of the series. 0c-ordinates corresponding to the centre of each marker are computed using a cross-cor~elation technique and correction for both translation and rotation is then made using a least squares error minimizafion method. Similarly we succeeded to detect the bladder tumours with the use of 7E9 antibodies as well as the mammary carcinoma with HBCa 12 antibodies. At intervals of 72 hours and longer blood background gradually decreased bat in the sites of tumours the radioactivity remained.",

Imaging of tumours with antiferrltin and control nonspeclfic F/ab'/2 fragments will be also reported. A suhpopulation of lymphoeytes, called natural killer cells (NK-cells), shows a spontanous capacity to kill tumor cells without previous sensitisation. Therefore, it plays an important role in tumor defence. T~e ability to prevent formation of metastases is suggested. ~thod: The activity of the NN-cells was determined by means of a Cr-51-releasinA-test in oatients with prostatic carcinoma or renal adenocarcinoma. As target cedis were used: K-562 lymphoma cells, cultured prostatic earcinoma cells (PC-3) and homologous (Caki-]) and autolo~ous renal t&~or cells. The in vitro-stimulation with Interferon and other i~unstimu-]sting a~ents was performed. Patients were grouped according to therapy and stare of disease. The results we, e compared to a control group of healthy men of same age. Results: 1.Patients with locai carcinoma showed a nearly uncba~ed NR-oell activity. 2. Patients with renal carcinoma who survived surgical therapy for more than one year and remained free of metastases showed normal activity. All patients who died On account of their disease had low or missinE activity already preoperative. 3. Estrogen therapy of prostatic carcinoma suppressed the activity of the NK-cells gradually in course of treatment, while estramustine did not change it. 4. In vitro-stimuiation with Interferon was possible. The degree if it decrased on treatment with estrogen and with progressive disease. Other immunstimulants did not affect the activity in vitro. 5. BCO vaccination stimulated low NK-cell activity; high activity could not be increased further. Recent advances in chemistry, engineering and electronics have made new radiopharmaceuticals and new diagnostic modalities available. Pelvic and axillary lympho-scintigraphy was done on 211 patients during the last 20 months. With Tc 99m rhenium sulfide (TcK-17-C.I.S.), the vel~ city of migration of the radiocolloid enables a good quality visualization of the lymph vessels and lymph nodes of the abdominopelvic and axillary regions with a remarkable specificity and sensitivity. In 45 patients, lympho-scintigraphy was done and compared to diagnostic images taken via other modes such as computerized tomography, radiologi\u00a2 iy~phography and ultrasound.

The large variations called for corrections and, hence, we complemented the experiments with histopathological morphometrieal analysis of the tumor samples. When corrections were made for non-tumor tissue and for tumor necrosis, it was found that uptake as a function of the percentage of viable tumor in the sample converged at 100% of tumor at 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 % of given dose/g, for 30, 60 and 128 minutes, respectively. The linear regression functions were y=-O.93+O.O3x (N=5), y=O.26+O.O2x (N~O) and y=-1.62+O.O4x (N=8), respectively. The corresponding coefficients of correlation were 0.91, 0.68 and 0.52. It appears that in this tumor and in this animal the absolute FDG uptake seems to be constant at about 2.3% of injected dose/g of viable tumor tissue, at least as of 30 minutes postinjection. If the same is true for human cancers, it opens possibilities of determining response of tumors to therapy in vivo by PET. Malignant cells are generally glycolytically more active than normal cells. With the advent oF FDO, cancer diagnosis in vivo based on enhanced tumor glycolysis has become possible. We have studied 7 unselected adult cancer patients with 0.7-4.0 mCi FOG iv detected with a specially collimated gamma camera with a I in. crystal. Results: There were 4 patients with m~tastasis in the cervical lymph nodes, of these 2 were spread of head-and-neck cancer, I of unknown oridin, I of mammary ca; I patient had recurrent colon ca; I recurrent ca of the lung with metastasis to cervical in and liver; I hepatoma. All tumors were seen on the scans with unsubtracted tumor-tosurrounding ratios of 1.3-2.3. In the hepatoma a large central defect was seen. In all of the in metastases FDO accumulated enough for visualization, although the origin of the disease was different. We hoped to be able to identify the primary cancer in the patient who only had cervical in metastasis, but a FDG wholebody scan was not indicative. This contrasts to the patient with recurrent lung cancer where all known metastatic sites showed up on a wholebody image. The patient with hepatoma showed that FDG can discriminate between necrotic and vital tumor tissue. Conclusion: FOG accumulates into different cancers in man andappears to be selective for vital tissue. Future experience will reveal the true power of FDG to discriminate among the multitude of human malignant and benign lesions. PET is mandatory for quantitative information. After mice bearing transplantable mammary tumors had been injected i.v. with dyes as bromphenol blue er bromcresol green a delayed excretion of these substances from the tumor tissue became evident. The rapid blood clearance and the prolonged retention of these dyes labelled with Br-77 led to ratios of the activity concentrations between tumor tissue and blood as well as between tumor tissue and normal mammary tissue of 5.3 and 6,11 respectively within B hours after administration of the dyes. These ratios turned out to be dependent on the concentration of the dyes in the injected solution. Thin-layer chromatograms of plasma, bile and urine were identical with that of the injected compound and therefore confirmed the in rive stability of the Br-77 label. Administration of the same dyes labelled with J-131 resulted in ratios of the activity concentrations between blood and tumor tissue and between tumor tissue and normal mammary tissue much lower than that obtained for the Br-77 labelled substance. The high activity concentration in the blood and the accumulation of radioactivity in the thyroid of the animals after injection of the J-131 labelled dyes indicate that J-131 is released from the compound. Chromotography of plasma and urine confirmed the low in vivo stability of the J-131 label in comparison to the 8r-77 label.

Our experience from 1978 includes 29 patients (pts) affected with differentiated thyroid cancer and submitted to total thyroidectomy. In the last 10 pta whole body scan with 201-thallium chloride \u00b0and thyroglobulin (Tg) dosage were added in our diagnostic protocol for early detecting tumor recurrences during the follow-up. In this group 3 pts showed loco-regional metastases and were detected by whole body with 2St-thallium chloride in asymptomatic period. One ca~ se risulted false 9ositive for loco~ gional inflammatory disease. All four pts were controlled with surgery while the other 6 cases were confirmed true negative by whole body scan with 131-I and periodic clinical controls.However, in one out of 3 pts with latero-cervical metastatic lymph nodes the whole body scan with 131-I resulted false negative. The accuracy rate of Tg monitoring was 100%.Iu our experience the 201-thallium scan allowed to detect metastases of thyroid carcinoma without interrupting suppressive therapy with L-T4,avoiding so TSH increase and discomfort for the therapy discontinuity. In patients submitted to surgical thyroldectomy for early differentiated thyrold carcinoma (Ta,No,Mo) , the subsequent total body scanning with 131-I (TB S) often shows the only partial ablation of the thyroid tissue. In these patients high serum thyroglobulin levels (hT~) d~ monsrrate that the residual tissue in the thyroid bed is affected by differen~ tinted thyroid carcinoma. In the past 3 years, iu 29 subjects surgically treated for ezrly papilla~y tumor of the thyroid who had residual thyroid tissue, we measured serum hTg levels both durin~ suppressive hormonal treatment (l~g/KE/day of L-T3) and after the replacement ther~ spy discontinu~tlon. The results were as follows: fourteen patients had undetecta ble or very ic~ hTg levels (<9 ng/ml) -both during L-T3 therapy and after L-T3 withdrawal; sine patients during the sup pressive treatment had very low hTg le-vels (<9 ng/ml) that increased but remaining in the normal range (<5~ ng/ml) after the therapy discontinuation; six patients had an exaggerated increase of hTg values after L-T3 withdrawal {>54 ng/ml), although they had undetectable hTg values duping the hormonal replacement. This study shows that serum hTg, in patients with early thyroid cancer previously submitted to surgical thyroid ectomy, is often undetectable during th~ suppressive hormonal therapy, although the p~tients have ~esldual tissue in the thymold bed. Moreover, it shows that a group of patients, to all appearance homogeneous, could be divided in 3 subsets according to the variations of serum hTg levels during the suppressive therapy withdrawal. The thyreoglobulin (TG) concentration was measured in the sera of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma who had undergone surgical treatment, In a]most all of them radioiodine ablation of the thyroid remnant was done. TG was measured by commercial kit in the range of 20-1280 ng/ml, A total number of 133 patients were included in the study and some of them were monitored during a longer period of time.",

In cases of prostate carcinoma the final decision to attempt a curative radical prostatectomy depends entirely on wether or not there is lymph node involvement. If the lymph nodes contain metastases only palliative systemic treatment should be attempted. The investigation of iocoregional lymph nodes can only be done by histological analysls of lymph node material after a staging lymphadenectomy. TO decide wether the determination of prostate acid phosphatase (PAP) could be of help, the RAP levels were determined in 34 patients on which a stagin E lymphadenectomy was to he performed. The results of the PAP determinations were compared with the histological findings in the removed lymph nodes. There was a high correlation of histologically Rroven involvement of lymph nodes and an elevated level of PAR as determined b y the immunochemical method (EIA) of Merck. In ig of 19 patients without lymph node metastases the PAP concentrations were lower than i.O ~g/l. All of the 15 patients with positive lymph nodes had PAP levels above 1.0 ~g/l. The fact that 3 patients with histologically proven negative lymph nodes showed elevated RAP levels could possibly be explained by involvement of pre-saoral lymph nodes.

In order to evaluate different methods for estimating prostate acid phosphatase (PAP) a followup study was performed within a group of 89 patients with histologically proven prostate cancer. The results were related to bone seintigraphy. At operation 56 patients were free of bone metastases (M-) or in remlssion at the time of investigation and 33 patients were regarded as having bone metastases (M+) based on hone scintigraphy. Patients had undergone either transurethral resection and/or hormonal therapy with DES. In a later or advanced stage orchiectomy was performed and/or Androeur therapy given. If possible blood samples were taken every 6 weeks; the maximum follow-up time was 15 months. The different PAP methods were: I. Enzymatic using ~ -n~phtylphosphate; 2. Enzymatic using thymolphtaleinemonophosphate on the ACA; 3. Elisa (Behringwerke); 4. EIA (Merck); 5. RIA (Clinical Assays); 6. IRMA (Hybritech). Altogether 400 samples of 89 patients were analyzed. During the course of the investigation 7 patients were moved from M+ into M-because following treatment no changes in the seintigram occurred and X-ray or clinical examination provided alternative explanations for the abnormalities on the scintigram. All PAP methods had a specificity above 95 percent with sensitivities ranging from 80 to 9E percent, the EIA and IRMA method being the highest. We concluded that the determination of PAP at regular intervals with one of these methods provided a more reliable parameter for posttreatment monitoring of patients with prostate carcinoma than bone seintigraphy. TPA monitoring of 28 patients (pts) submitted to radical Surgery for large bowel cancer was carried OUt during the foll0w-up every two months for detecting early local or distant recurrences,In all cases the diagnosis was controlled by C~ scans, colonscop[ and hepatic 8/1giography. In 4 pts tumor recurrence was observed whereas no evidence of disease was achieved in 24 oases (medi8/l follow-up = 17.5 months). In these 28 pts the difference between TPA and CEA sensitivity rate was high (100% and 25% respectively) and statistically significant (p < 0.05).TPA specificity rate was 79.2% because of the high incidence of false positive cases (5 pts) as compared to the CEA monitoring, that showed only one false positive case and higher specificity rate (95.8%). According to vhe i~nunobiological different characteristics and to present results, the combined use of TPA and CEA dosages seems to be considered very useful, giving an early correct diagnosis in 71.4% out of the patients examined.

High levels of sermon ferritin were reported in various malignancies. The origin of this hyper-ferritinae~ia, however, remains unknown: non specific changes in iron or ferritin metabolism as well as production of increased a~ounts of nomal or abnormal ferritin by malignant cells may be involved. Normally serl~n ferritin is secreted by the cells of the reticuloeedothelial system. Norwood et al. have shown that a large proportion (80%) of the circulating ferritin binds to Concanavalin A (Con A), whereas tissue ferritin binds poorly to Con A. In order to investigate the s(~lrce of serum ferritin in patients with malignancy, sere of 28 cancer patients and of 7 normal persons, as well as i0 t~tlour cytosols were absorbed with Con A-Sephaxose.

A further 18 pts underwent biplane contrast RV studies i~ediately preceded by NAO FRRA~ imaging being performed in all pts using a multicrystal ca/nora. Contrast REEF was measured using a single or biplane area length formula. For FPEA, an RV region of interest (ROI) was obtained with an iterative technique which minimised count contributions from pulmonary artery and right atrium, and ~sed only beats preceded by a complete diastolic phase. Background was a ringshaped ROI 2 em wide, and background counts per pixel at end diastole were uniformly subtracted from the RV pixels. REEF from FPRA correlated moderately well with single plane contrast RVEF ( r=0.74, SEE 6.5%) for RVEF range of 21-61%~ and better with biplane contrast RVEF (r=0.87, SEE 4.1%) over a similar RVEF range. RVEF from FPRA showed high inter-observer and sequential reproducibility (r=0.93, SEE 2.9% and r=0.96, SEE 2.5% respectively). The effect of bolus integrity on calculated REEF was assessed in a further 4 pts by sequential FPRA at different bolus injection rates (I-10 mls/sec) using gold-195m (51/2 30.5 seconds). Mean + S.D. RVEF variability was 4.1~1.8%, and did not correlate with bolus duration. In conclusion, I) RVEF from FPNA correlates well with biplane contrast RVEF when studies are done close together, 2) the results are highly reproducible, and 3) rate of bolus delivery does not affect RVEF calculations.

Subsequent catheterization revealed 1O patients with a moderate pressure gradient across the aortic valve (~ 35 ~g) constituting group l, whereas the remainder had a gradient exceeding 70 I~Hg (group 2). All patients had a norm&l ejection fraction exceeding 60%. Time activity curve underwent Fourier transformation for smoothing. Time between enddiastole and endsystole as well as enddiastolic-endsystolic count rate differences (stroke volume equivalent) were normalized and expressed in %. Sequential analysis of the time activity curve in 10% volume-output increments during systole revealed that up to 60% of ejected stroke volume there was a significant contraction delay as seen by the longer time needed, thus reflecting the underlying hemodynamic disturbancies. This delay in contraction was quantified hy the area underneath the time activity curve during systole averaging 47.6~2.2% in group 1 but 50.5~2.6% in group 2 (p < 0.05). Using this latter index 6 of 10 patients with severe aortic stenosis could be detected noninvasively. If using additional parameters, i. e. the time necessary to eject the first i0% of the stroke volume, an even higher discrimination between moderate and severe AS can be reached.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate global and regional left ventricular function in patients with coronary artery disease using radionuciide ventriculooraphy and two-dimensional echocardiography. The results were compared to those of contrast ventricu]ography and coronary angiography. The study was carried out in 30 patients with coronary artery disease, with and without history of previous myocardial infarction. Radionuclide ventriculography was performed as a gated cardiac blood pool study, at rest and during exercise. The rate and time parameters were computed from the left ventrlcular timeactivity curve. For each of these paramegers functional images were obtained using Fourier phase and amplitude analysis. By means of twodimensional echocardiography global and segmen\" ta] left ventricular anatomy and function (thickness, echo-structure, kinetics) were studied. All patients underwent contrast ventriculography using the usual technique and coronary angiography by the Judkins technique. In addition to the contrast ventriculography and coronary angiography data, our results indicate precise assessment of morphological and functional consequences of coronary artery disease by combined use of radionuclide ventriculography and two-dimensional echocardiography. The above non-invasiva procedure allows selection of patients for subsequent more invasive procedures and followup in coronary artery disease. 63 patients,53 with suspected coronary artery disease and unconclusive stress EKG and 10 with post myocardial infarction angina, underwent rest-exercise First Pass Ventriculography (FPV) to evaluate alterations of left ventricular kinetic secondary to ischemia. The studies were performed with a digital gamma camera equipped with a high sensitivity collimator. Each patient received 25+25 mCi of 99m Tc DTPA from a catheter positioned in the superior cava vein at rest and after a symptom-Limited exercise test, performed on a bycicte ergometer in the supine position. Coronary angiograms performed at the same period were negative for CAD in 25 and positive in 38 patients. We analyzed sensitivity (S), specificity (SP), positive and negative predictive value (PPV and NPV) of the global ejection fraction (EF) and the three functional images (fI): Regional Ejection Fraction (REF), Amplitude (A) and Phase (Ph). Our results are summarized as follows: The use of the ultra short lived-generator produced radionuclide, Gold 195m, and the development of a semi automatic treatment program for first pass cardiac studies have allowed the development of the stress cardiac studies in our department. Previously to the application of the technique to pathological cases, evolution at stress ( cycloergometer in half sitting position ) of the fo. llowing functional cardiac parameters, he~J~t rate {HR), cardlac output lndex (COI)~stroke volume index ISVI), mean systolic and diastolic times (MST,MDT) 7 ventricular transit times (TT) and telediastolic volume index ITDVI) obtained from first pass cardiac curve analysis has been studied in 12 young healthy volunteers (23 y old, 21-39) using Gold 195m ( up to max 6 successive bolus injections performed at rest and thereafter at each stress level -3 min. per level, from 50 to 200 Watts max by 25 or 50 ~atts steps ). Dynamic data ( 400 frames of 0,08 sec or 800 frames of 0.04 sec followed by 35 frames of 0.8 sac) were stored on disks and thereafter treated using a semi automatic treatment program necessiting a minimal intervention of the physician and \"working\" during the night. In all cases, HRand COI increased and TT decreased as stress level increased. Left ventricular ejection fraction I*) as 8VI increased as well. TDVI increased in most and slightly decreased in some. MST and F~IT decreased but the latter more than the former. These studies and their conclusions 1 repeated in four patients, were demonstrated to be reproducible.

A computer-assisted manual mode (single-, two-, or multi-frame options) is also provided to complement the automatic mode. Here the user defines the center, perimeters, and background locations. The actual edges are joystick-drawn with the aid of a special multi-quadrant display routine. This routine traces the edges on up to four images simultaneously: the original image of interest and up to three other \"help\" images, which aid the user in defining valve planes, etc. and greatly increase the reliability of the analysis. These \"help\" images are chosen by the user from among the following: Fourier phase and amplitude, stroke count (SC), or another of the multigated images. A complete set of parametric, curve, contour, and static and dynamic (cine) image displays is available for data review after completion of analysis in either mode.

Ejection fraction calculation by a modification of the minicomputer manufacturer's software requires continuous operator-computer interaction during the program. The operator must outline and designate end-diastolic, endsystolic and background regions-of-interest and initiate each step in the program. This allows for considerable operator error and uncertainty as well as variation in region-of-interest assignment.

The clinical and echocardiographic presence or absence of the left ventrieular failure (group A and group B) were both considered diseniminant in comparison to a group of controls, The EF compared to the controls>resulted reduced with statistic si~nifisance (group A p<0.001, group B p<0.01) in the patients with previous myocardial infarction; Accordingly the reduction of the mean EF in infarctuated patients with left ventrieular disfunction (group A) compared to those with good residual contractility (group B) appeared also statistically significant (P<U.O01). The PFR in both groups also appeared reduced compared to the controls (p<O.01). The difference between the normal values of PFR in the two groups was not significant. Left ventricular dilatation did not affect significantly the PFR values although lower values were observed in patients with evident ventricular disfunction. The PER resulted to be a more sensitive index of left ventricular function, as it also appeared altered in patients with previous myocardial infarction and uncompromised ejection fractions. This study was undertaken to compare the right (RVEF) and left ventrlcular ejection fraction (LVEF) after an acute inferior wall myocardial infarction (MI) caused by an obstruction in the right coronary artery (RCA) or circumflex coronary artery (CX) and to evaluate the value of lead V~R to predict the site of stenosls which caused the MI.

ReGional cerebral per~tsion was studied usin~ N-isopropyl-( I-123)-p-iodoamphetamine (IMP) and a rotating tomo~raphic gamma camera. Of the 16 patients with acute cerebral infarction i~ (g8 ~) had a positive IMP scan when studied 1-10 days afte~ the onset~ whereas transmission computed tomography (CT) was positive in only 5 (38 ~) of the 15 patients studied. The two patients with a he-Native I~IP scan also had a negative UT and nuclear magnetic resonance (MMI{) scan, The lesion in the CT scan was often smaller than that in the IMP scan. IMP is themefore a much more sensitive method than CT for localizing perfusion defects in acute stroke. In 6 patients with various CT positive brain tlusors the IMP scan was positive in 4. The two negative studies were Jn patients with small astrocytomas. Of 8 patients with focal epilepsy and normal CT scans two had an eqttivocally decreased local uptake of IMP when studied interictallyo In 6 patients with epilepsy the IMP scan was classified as normal. Quantifying the uptake of tracer and performin 6 scinti~raphy ictally when possible might provide more exact information on perfusion derangements in patients with epilepsy\u00b0 In patients with suspected MS, often the disease cannot be confirmed at the first episode by liquor tests (LT) or CT scans. NMR has been shown to be superior to CT in demonstrating sclerotie lesions. In this study, accuracy and usefulness of NMR scans in MS was assessed. Patients (P) were scanned in a 0.15 T resistive magnet (Teslacon TM, Teehnieare) at the Hausstein Clinic. Usually spin echo modes with 1000 ms repetition time and 120 ms echo delay, SEIOO0/120, were applied, depicting normal brain and ventricles without contrast but highlighting MS lesions. Anatomy was assessed by SE500/30 mode, inversion echo IE1200/400/30 and IE1200/I00/30 demonstrated both anatomy and pathology. Slice thickness was 15 mm. One 200 ~ thick sagittal SE1200/120 image was recorded giving a survey of pathology. 43 P with MS suspected from history were studied. 3 had no clear evidence of Y~ due to neurological findings, LT or CT. In 37 P NMR was positive. The 5 P with negative NNR included I P with cerebellar atrophy, also seen on CT, I case with negative LT and likely psychogenic paralysis and 7 case with questionable positive LT. LT were done in 29 P, 21 positive and 3 negative consistently with NMR. In 2 P only NMR and in 3 P only LT were positive. Thus, sensitivity of NNR in diagnosing MS was 37/41 = 90% in our study. In 135 other cases not suspective of MS topographic comparable images with the same scan modes were taken. Only in I P periventricular lesions with high signal in SEIgO0/120 mode were seen. ~]~om these results, NMR seems to be highly specific. But when correctly evaluating specificity of NMB in diagnosing MS, investigation and long term follow up of a large number of patients with suspected MS at their first episode is necessary. Even thoagh NMR is an expensive investigation, it might be helpBal in dubious cases. However, its usefulness in early diagnosis of MS has still to be established. O. Shimamura, T. Bahizu, Y. Inoue, H. Adachi, H. ljiehi RI angiography of brain by 99m-Tc intravenous injection were employed to evaluate the change of the cerebral circulation of patients with occlusive cerebrovascular disease in chronic stage and control cases. 99m-Tc pertechnetate, iB-Z0mCi, were administrated two time sequentially with 320 seconds interval. Six parameters (appearance to peak time, mode of transit time, peak count, peak count ratio, ups]ope value, upslope ratio) which were caluculated from time activity curve of ROI(region of interest) in each hemisphere were compared between first study and second study.",

A MODEL-FREE APPROACH. L. Nyitrai*and Z. Szabd** 99mTc is often used for brain perfusion studies. The problem of calculating regional blood flow is not uniquely solved in this way and requires complicated technical and mathematical procedures. Because of the large variety of possib]e models which will satisfy a given distribution curve, a model-free determination of the transfer function (e.g. organ response to a unique impulse) has been developed to produce exact calculation of two system parameters: a) regional blood volume (rBV) in m1/I00 g and b) regions] mean circulation time (MCT). The model-free estimation of the regional transfer function presented here uses a filter function in the frequency domain,and the aortic activity is utilized as input function. From this transfer function, regional blood f)ew is calculated as rBF = rBV/MCT. The above approach has been validated by more than 100 measurements with a flow-calibrated closed circulatory phantom. After injection of 99mTc into the system, timeactivity curves were obtained, from which flow was ca]culated. Calculated and measured flow values correlated well (r = 0.96). The method provides a clinically acceptable twodimensional display of cerebral rBF using conventiona] gamma cameras. Current availability of cheaper high resolution computer hardware and peripherals coupled with recent progress in the introduction of digitally based imaging devices in nuclear medicine, US, CT, NMR and new X-ray means that the process of recording and archiving is bound to change in the next few years. This presentation will discuss the impact of and the way in which a digitally based department will influence and modify the technique of saving images, reporting, production of hard copy, archiving and subsequent follow up. The range of grey scale now available requires more physician interaction to produce the final image for hard copy. On the other hand the wide distribution of terminals produces a need for simple daylight processing at the point of reviewing. The clinical requirements in this evolving situation will be discussed. First the structural analysis in medicine was done by X-ray and recorded on film until new technologies were introduced. They changed the methods of documentation drastically. The ideal requirements for recording media are met by systems and materials. These are considerably influenced. The need for image storage arises for diagnosis, reporting and reference, teaching and research. Even if the reports are made, the images must be stored for later review and follow-up examinations. The whole data are transferred to magnetic media for permanent store.",

            "text": "The storage for teaching and research includes a wide range from an image for the referring physician or the documentation for publication. Depending on the purpose it must be prints (patient's file, case notes, publication) or transparent film (clinical conferences, seminars), and slides are needed for meetings or correct color rendition. The use of photographs in training has to be classified in this category also. The relationship between the above mentioned main requirements of a correct, permanent, reliable and instant availa~ le documentation, and the anticipation of the user (compactness, economy, convenience) and/or the conditions of the object recorded (movement, accessibility, sensibility) are discussed. In connection with local possibilities (type of archives, dark-room, film processor, color images etc.) all these factors are concerned in the choice of the documentation medla. Based on one year experience in more than 4B0 patients, we try to point out clinically meaningful indications for h~R studies: Concerning the CNS, NM.R seems to be superior to other imaging modslities in most cases. Often tumors like astrocytomas or small gliomas of the brain stem or of the cerebell~ can be localized only by means of NMR. Sagittal views of the spinal cord reveal pathologies and their cranio-caudal extent. 7nfla~natory or demyelinating processes can be detected at an early stage, influencing further diagnostic and possibly therapeutic procedures. In EKQ triggered tomograms, mediastinal masses can be discriminated from neighboring structures without contrast material. ~he four cavities of the heart can be visualized simultaneously, rendering additional information in certain eases. Tumors and metastases of abdominal organs can be detected by means of fast and unexpensive sodalities. However, the TI and T2 times may give evidence of the most likely etiology of the primary tumor. Different pathologies of the pelvis are primarily diagnosed by other sodalities, whereas NMR might be useful in staging and foIlow up in known disease. Femoral head necrosis at an early stage is best assessed by NMR. In suspected mali~nancy of the bone, NMR will be helpful in differential diagnosis when pl~e radiographs or CT are uncertain. In the future, more profound knowledge of normal and pathological relaxation times will certainly extend the present indications of NMR. The use of paramagnetic contmast agents will improve the capability of NMR in morphological and functional investigations. The signals the pictures are calculated from, base upon both, proton density and relaxation times T and To. According to the choice of ~he RF ~ulse sequences, image quality depends on these three parameters. Thus, despite of a high spatial resolution pathological changes of tissue either can be seen with a very high contrast or are lost due to missing contrast. Therefore discrimination and delineation of different tissues may become difficult. Extensive variations of the pulse sequences during a patient's examination in order to achieve an optimal contrast of the region of interest to its environment and so using the pulse sequences as \"electronic contrast media\" hardly will be accepted because of the time needed. This lecture is meant to present a procedure which, basing upon two measurements per cross-section, permits the calculation and comparison of images representing measurements with different pulse sequences in a computer in order to optimize the contrast. Even virtual images can be created which have some great advantages. One also can use the calculated parameter images as a base for tissue characterization in a color coded mode. Trace amounts of par~agnetic metal ions have been shown to reduce the sp~%-lattice relaxation time (TI) of nuclei in the surrounding environment because of the strong electron-nuclear magnetic moment interaction. By incorporating paramagnetic metal ions into stable c~nplexes, toxicity can be dr~natically reduced while maintai-~ting a significant par~nagnetic effect. We studied the T 1 reducing properties of FO because iron is c~ra~only occurring in the body fluids and is bound tightly to desferrioxsmine B and because the presence of ferrioxamine B in thousands of individuals has rarely been associated with adverse effects. Water hydrogen T l values were detenained for invitro specimens utilizing the inversion recovery medlodwith a 2.35 Tesla JEOLFXIOO ~iR spectrometer operating at 21 ~ 0.5 =C.

The addition of emission tomography (SPECT) to pulmonary perfusion imaging should improve di-aZ~lostic accuracy by detecting-perfusion defects otherwise masked by superimposition of normal lung activity and by reducing problems with interpretation of defects that result from overlying soft tissue or pleural effusions.

This compound, currently evaluated for brain perfusion studies, is extracted and metabolized Hy the lung like vaso active amines. Kinetic analysis of radioactive HIPDM time/acfivity curves, recorded by gamma camera over the lung fields up to 3 hrs from i~, injection, showed that HIPDM lung dismission is described by three exponential components; the first two are completed by 40 min and may reflect early redistribution. The third component exhibits a slow decay with a mean time(t) of several hrs, compatible with a cellular metabolic process. To detect lung cellular damage we measured t of NIPDM time/activity curves in 25 subjects: 8 normal non smokers(NS), 9 smokers of 20 sigarctics/day(S), 4 patients with cardiec pulmonary edema(CPE) and 4 patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS Serial Gallit~-67 (Ga) scans were performed in 12 patients at a high risk for having Aquired Lr~une Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).

Gamma camera renography with deconuolution analysis has been shown to be a sensitive and valuable method to define altered renal function in obstructive nephropathy. However,diagnostically relevant parameters differentiating a true obstruction from slow elimination through capacious pelvis are hardly to prove,since other renal disorders may influence the renogram-values in the same manner.Separating parenchyMatous areas from the pelvis we analysed some characteristic parameters in different renogram-phases after standardized increase of the intrapelvic pressure.

Based on these results the following clinical diagnostic scheme for the evaluation of equivoeal gUT-obstruction is recommanded: 2. Combined use of non-invasive DR and determination of tmean-p as one radioisotope study. When both show obstructive (non-obstructive) results, obstruction (non-obstruction) is reliably diagnosed. 2. When the results of both disagree, PFS are necessary. 3. When PFS reveal eqivocal results, short-term follow-up examinations should be performed. The accuracy of CUSG in the detection of VUR was assessed in 42 patients (pts) in whom x-ray micturition cystourethrography {MCG) was performed. A small catheter was inserted to fill the bladder with 500 ml saline containing 0.2 mOi ggmTc-~YPPA. The patiezt wa~ then asked to void while seated; a computerized 7-camera served to record scintigraphic data during micturition (6 frames/min for 15 miD). The recorded images were analyzed as follows: i) generation of activity profiles on the added-on sequential images, to select adequate ROIs over the ureters and kidneys; 2) generation of activity/time curves for the selected ROIs, to evidentiate and quantitate VURs. CUSG and MCG were both positive or negative in 18 pts each, with an 85.7% overall agreement. Two pts were VUR-positive at MCG and negative at CUSG (10% false negative with CUSU). The remaining 4 pts were VUR-positive at CUSG and negative at MCG (83.3% apparent specificity for CUSG as referred to MCG). In 5 out of 18 VUR-positive pts at MCG, CUSG detected more \u00a3U0normalities than NCG itself (menD-or hilaterality, and severity of VUR). These results indicate the usefulness of CUSG, and emphasize the necessity for a critical reappraisal of MCG as the \"gold standard\" for VUR detection. As to the 2 false negative findings at CUSG, intermittent VUR is the most likely cause. EUSG is particularly advantageous for the precise quantitation DIVER in the postoperative follow-up, especially if performed with a tubular excretion tracer given iv, combined with furosemide-induced hyperdiuresis, so totally avoiding invasiveness. Renal perfusinn is, if at all, maiuiy quantified with 133-Xenon. The present study reports a new approach using 99mTc. After intravenously injecting I0 mCi 99mTc-DTPA, serial renal scintJgraphy by a conventional gamma camera (i2O frames in one minute) permitted generation of time-activity curves from aorta and kidney. Computer assisted sequential digita] filtering of the curves was followed by deeonvolution in the frequency domain with an appropriate filter function. After reverse Fouriertransformation of the obtained transfer function the mean circulation time (MCT) was calculated from the distribution of transit times. The regional blood volume rBV was estimated using Sheppard's nonlinear formula based on the parallel random walk model. The regional blood flow is given by rBF = rBV/MCT. Interference by statistical noise and the effect of fittering and smoothing on measured data were tested by computer simulation; MCT was less affected than rBV. This method was clinically applied to 45 renal transplants. In patients with satisfactory transplant function, rBF was found to be cemparable to renal plasma flow measured by hippuran clearance (r= 0.67). In patients with acute or subacute transplant rejection the hippuran clearance was very significantty decreased to about I/3 of rBF (r = 0.92). Thus renal transptant rejection can clearly be distinguished noninvasively by decreased correlation between tubular function and renal perfusJon. The Tubular Transit Index (TTI) is a measure of hippuran excretion determined during gammacamera renograDhy using 1-131-hippuran performed after administration of furosemide. This index is calculated by dividinq the bladder activity in the 6th-10th min by the sum of the kidney and bladder activities in the Ist-5th miD. In patients with renal allografts showing a stable renal function the TTI amounts to 1.39+0.18 (range 1.09-1.80l. In this stndy we evaluate the use of TTI for the diagnosis of acute rejection within a 3 weeks observation period after the diuresis >i 1/day. When diuresis is <i 1/day, hippuran is not excreted within I0 miD. During the observation period the TTI was measured i-3 times a week. Acute rejection was diagnosed by the usual signs and symptoms. The 28 patients studied were divided into two groups. Group I: 17 patients, whose course during this period was not complicated by acute rejection. Six showed in~nediate diuresis of >I 1/day and the remaining Ii initially had oliguria. Group 2: 11 patients, in whom acute rejection occurred within the observation period. Five had immediate diuresis; the remaining 6 initially had oliguria. 0nly 2 patients of group i, who showed immediate diuresis, had a normal TTI-value on the first examination. The remaining 15 initially had a low TTZ, which increased with time and reached the normal lower limit between the 10th and 15th day. Renal alloqraft function became adequate when TTI had reached 0.3, so that hemodialysis could be discontinued. In 10 of the ii patients of group 2 at the beginning of ~n rejection episode the TTI decreased and became less than i; in S patients this occurred before serum creatinine incmeased. In the remaining patient of group 2 the decl'ease of the TTI occurred later. We conclude that serial measurements of the TTI are useful for the detection of acute rejection, in particular in cases in whom serum creatinine does not decrease as expected. The following four reagents, destinated to instant preparation for radionuclide lymphatic studies underwent an in vitro and in vivo study : A : sulfur-microcolleid (Solco); 8 : human-serum albumin microcolloid (Nanocoll, Solco);C : antimony sulfide colloid (BYK); D : rhenium sulfur colloid (IRE).The IRE Mo/Tc generator was used in combinaison with all tested products. Stabiiity, pH, amount of free 99mTcOa (as seen by chromatography) were quite simiTar whereas concentration of dry substance and osmolality as criteria gave rather discordant results during in vitro testing.The dianleter of elementary particules of all 4 products, as seen by negative staining on electromicroscopical level varied between 8 and 36 rim,with a general tendeREe to form agglomerates constituted by 2 to 4 subunits. In the famework of in vive analysis, pain following injection (depending on the osmolality), image-quality, number of visualized lymph nodes, target/background ratio, lymph node and liver uptake and extraction from injected deposit have been evaluated,based on qualitative and quantitative criteria of bipedal, internal mammary and axillary ]ymphoscintigrams (140 cases studied). Registered by a whole body scanning camera connected to a computer, total lymph node activity has been expressed as c/sec/mCi injected and measured 3 h after injection over lymph node areas, lhis parameter allowed to characterize the differences among the 4 products,according to age, to presence or absence of edema, to previous irradiation or to morphologically controlled lymphatic pathology. The greatest migration speed and, parallel,the highest total activity over the visualized lymph node areas (40 % extraction from the deposits after 3 hours in normal cases and 25 Z in pathological ones) has been obtained by the product B; whereas A and D showed the most discriminating difference (2,8 to 2,9 times higher fixations-quotient) between normal and pathologic lymph nodes.",

The role of lymphoscintigraphy in determining irradiation fields for breast cancer is assessed. Lymphoscintigraphy associated with 99mTc MDP imaging is the only non-invasive method of obtaining a precise representation of internal mammary lymphatic drainage routes. The first step in this exploration protocol is a chest scintigram realized after subcostal injection on the same side as the tumour of i mCi of 99m-Tc antimomy sulfide. The second step is a scintigram obtained 1,5 hours after a controlateral injection of the same radionuclide. A third scintigram is taken 1,5 hours after intravenous injection of i0 mCi of 99m-Tc MDP. Of the 76 breast cancer patients studied, lymphoscintigraphy identified cross-drainage in 19 cases. In 4 cases, there was no lymphatic visualization. The sulfide colloid was injected again into these 4 patients to make sure that the failure was not due to technical reasons. In all the cases of cross-drainage and in 13 cases where the mammary chain was homolateral to the tumour and was situated more than 4 em from the median line (the limite usually adopted in irradiation protocols), radiation therapy fieldlimits had to be changed as a result of lymphoscintigraphic investigation. This study confirms the great variety of internal mammary drainage pathways and emphasizes the importance of their being precisely localized prior to radiotherapy. Exact anatomical localization in relation to the sternum and ribs is realized with bone scan associated lymphoseintigraphy. When scintigraphic investigation is extended to the whole body, possible bone metastases can also be identified. We have developed a machine allowzng to realize in an optimal way a 99mTc-DTPA deposition into the bronchial tree in respect with the ventilation rate.",

Its demonstration, at rest, requires the combination of perfusion and metabolic criteria to differentiate between infarction and viable ischemic tissues. The purpose of this study was to assess the importance of residual ischemia at rest in a selected group of patients between 10 days to 2 months after the acute MI and to document the reversibility of the ischeraic lesions. Given that several treatments are under evaluation in order to reduce the size oF acute myocardial infarction (AMI), it seems useful to evaluate the effect of standard therapy (ST) (rest, heparin, lidoca{ne) in patients with AMI. 56 patients (PTS) (M : 47, P : 9, Mean age : 45 yr~ with proven AMI (typical EKG, modification of cardiac enzymes) underwent the following protocol : SPECT and RNA at admission and 2 weeks later.

A me,an of 2.9 grafts per patient was inserted (27 grafts in left 8nterior descend enting coronary artery, 17 in ~he circumflex, 14 in the right coronary artery). Operations were performed in sistemic hypotermia (2g-28 ~) cold potassit~ eardioplegia (4 ~) and surface cooling. Myocardial damage was diagnosed by the eontempo[ az~ positivities of EKG, CK-MB and 99m-Te-pyroph osphate scans (TcPPi) performed 1 day befot~ and 3-5 days after surgery. Gated cardiac blood pool studies were carried out within 5 days before and 3 to 5 months after surgery. LVEF and regional wall motions were evaluated in LAO view at rest and during hsndgrip. Each patient was sy~tomless after syrgery. All preoperative TcPPi im ages were megative; postoperative control showed 1 positive case (perioperative d~age). Mean LV EF at rest was unchanged by coronary bypass surgery (55 ~ lg vs 56 \u00b1 ii); during hand~ip there was s slight improvment (53 \u00b1 12 vs 55 \u00b1 13). In feroapical, inferolatersl and posterolateFal kin esis i/gproved after surgery; on the perioperative damage ease only e marked reduction of the m~ tilitywas observed in the infe~olateral wail. Postoperative septal motion was paradox in 6 cases; seven addictional cases showed also Teduct~ on of contractility. Althou~ht global and regi~ hal left ventricular reserve is improved by core nary bypass surgery, the high incidence of abno~ mality Of septal motion makes difficolt the evaluation of this area and, in some eases, it gives rise to obscure the real response of the other walls and the global ejection fraction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate after six months the efficiency of intracoronary streptokinase in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (MI). The study population consisted of 58 patlents, divided in four Kroups : i) LADp (10 patients) with successful reperfusion of the left anterior descending artery in the first five hours after ME. ii) L~Dc (15) a control group of mI patients admitted after 5 hours, who had single vessel disease with LAD thrombosis of similar location on anglo,am performed at 3 weeks, iii) RCAp (18) techniques are widely used in the follow-up of patients with renal or liver transplants; typical scintigraphic patterns for acute or subacute rejection are well established. Little is known, however, about cardiac grafts although monitoring of pump function by MUGA will be very simple.",

The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that after general anesthesia for non cardiac surgical proeedures~ hemodynanic responses of recovery induce wall motion and ejection fraction (EF) abnormalities in patients suffering from mi]d angina pecforis.

These results indicate the occurrence in hypothyroidism of some adaptative mechanism(s), whereby the peripheral tissues metabolize T 4 by preferentially producing the more active hormone, T 3. By increasing the T 4 to T 3 CR, the small amounts of available T 4 are thus utilized in the most efficient way. We report this association in two series of retrospectively analysed patients (pts).

Nistolog{cal examlnation of cold sc~ntizraphic nodules of the thyroid is the definite diasnostic test for the differential diaKnosis of malignancies from non-malimnancies. Non-invas[ve tests, such as ultrasonoKraphy (US) have been used to provide a dla~nosJs before surgery. In this study we have attemoted to evaluate retrospectively the efficacy of I~ appearances as an approach to the assessment and management of cold nodules, lan patients with a scintigraphic diagnosis of cold nodules of the thyroid have been examined with fie. All the patients underwent surgery. We re-evaluated their data usin~ clinical records and U~ to compare them with the results of the histological diagnoses at surgery. There were 27 carcinomas (18%] and 121 benign lesions. The US appearances of the nodules were considered essentially for two parameters: the edge of the nodules and the appearances of the texture. The first parameter has not shown any relationship to the malignancy; in fact, of the carcinomas, 30% had a well defined edge, and of the benign lesions~ 47% had an undetectable edge. Multiolicity has not shown to be a criterion for non-maliznancy; in our serie, it had not significative differences between both eaarcinomas and benizn lesions (52% v.s. 3e%). Cystic changes were observed ~n any type of pathology, mainly in benign diseases, hut it was not a typical finding. ~imple cysts were never seen in carcinomas. Decreased echogenicity was commoner in carcinomas, but did not favour maliznancy. Increased or normal echcgenicity was never found in carcinomas. We concluded that: US alone can not be used for distinguishin g malignancies from non-malignancies and the demonstration of a simple cyst by US excludes the possibility of maliKnancy; in fact, US alone was a useful but limited test for differential diagnosis. We believe that the use of clinical data, US and scintigraphy combined together is the most reliable way to screen a nodule of the thyroid. For the treatment of FTA, the results and eomplieations of surgery and 13i-I therapy are compared. 998 patients suffering from FTA were observed from Jan. 1960 to May 1981: Of these, 88 were not treated, 170 had drug therapy, 163 surgery, 577 (all above age 35) 13l-I therapy (dose 517,63 MBq!147.26). Successful results differed significantly between above groups (Tritest p<0.05) Of the 163 surgery patients, only i30 returned for a follow-up cheek. Consider ing also different types of operation, 95 of these (73.0%) had recovered completely. Of the radioiodine patients, only 483 were followed-up and 408(84.5%) were well again. The higher success rate of radiometabolic therapy is statistical ly vet7 significant (two-tailedt test p<O.Ol). Surgical complications were: Lesions of laryngeal nerve (1 case), hypoparathyroidism (2 cases), hypothyroidism (15 cases) and the death of i patienf during operation, in all 21 out of 130 patients (16.1%). The only complication with radioiodine therapy was hypothyroidism: 7 cases out of 483 (1.4%-two-tailed t test p<O.OOl) The higher success rate obtained through 131-T therapy recommends its use as first choice for the Functioning Thyroid Adenoma in patients above 35 years of age.",

Histological study with immunohisto-logic~l methods is to be done, P~ij~t-Hime Central Hospital, Lahti, Finland A method for simultaneous determlnation of thyroid structure and function that uses 99m-Tc pertechnetate, gamma camera and computer has been developed. Twenty minutes after intravenous injection the scintigram is taken. Pinhole collimator is positioned at optimal distance over the patient's neck which depends on the thyroid size. The uptake is calculated by means of FORTRAN program that makes all necessary corrections for pinhole non-uniformity, extrathyroidal activity and decay. This procedure equalizes the weight of all matrix elements what is essential for correct \"background\" subtraction. The system response to a flood source is used for non-uniformity correction. The influence of non-uniformity on the calculated value was studied using computer simulated thyroid scintigram and scint~grams of the thyroid phantom. Data corrected for uniformity give result that is in very good agreement with true value, while non-corrected data give result that differs considerably and depends on the thyroid volume. Another program is used for system callibration: using phantom callJbration images it automatically generates the third degree polynomial that describes efficiency-to-distance dependance. For the group of 40 euthyroad patients we got normal range (defined by mean +-2 s.d.) for 99m-Tcuptake from 0.3% to 3.7% and results show that it correlates better with clinical diagnosis than 24h 131-J-uptake does. The developed method enables one to determine total as well as regional uptake.",

The purpose of this study was to study more carefully free thyroid hor~ motes in pregnancy, still a matter of controversy. Patients: this study includes a total of 157 sera of women during thei\u00a3 last trimenon of pregnancy, seen by our gynecologists. We had no evidence for thyroid disease. All women had determinations of f~ee estriol in regular intervals. Analytical methods: free estriol (bmersham RIA), FT4/T4 and FTS/T3 (Corning kinetic two-tube RLAI, FT4 (Corning and Amersham single-tube RIA with 1-125-T4 analogue), FT3 (Amersham single-tube RIb using 1-125-T3 analogue) and TBG (Coming NLA). T4/TBG and T3/TBG ratios were calculated. Results: free estriol was found to he in the respective normal range. FT4 levels were medium to low but decreased in 0 of 17 (week 27 ~ 31)/ I of 38 (week 32 -36)/ 2 of 102 (week 37 -41) and slightly increased in 0/0/2 of the sera (Coming two-tube P~LA), decreased in 0/3/3 (Coming single-tube RIA), furthermore in 6/12/ 26 and increased in 0/i/4 (A/nersham RIb) of the cases. This was contrasted by the T4/TBG ratio being decreased in 6/22/45 of the sofa. FT3 levels were low normal to decreased with 9 of 19/ ll of 41/ 17 of 93 (Coming) and 3/5/10 (~Jnersham). The T3/TBG ratio was with 15/40/90 of the cases decreased in most of the sera. Conclusions: in general, FT4 (medium to lower normal range) and FT3 (lower normal range to decreased) by all RLAS used demonstrated the behaviour anticipated for late pregnancy though FT4 levels by the Amersham RIA were decreased in 28 % of the sera which is most likely due to technical differences between the assays. On contrast, the T4/THG ratio was decreased in about half and the T3/TBG ratio in almost all of the se~a which probably exaggerates the physiological situation being present in late pregnancy. Curing the last years we reported a very high clinical value of FT4 and FT3 as determined by radioligand assay (RLA). This study was designed to further validate these assays by investigating patients with severe non-thyroidal illnesses (NTII. Patients: 58 intensive-care patients with severe trauma were studied cross-sectionally and a total of 125 with polytrauma, 29 of whome did not survive, longitudinally on admission, in-between and prior to discharge or death. Analytical methods: FT4/T4 and FT3/T3 by kinetic P~A, TBG by RLA (Coming), Tgu (Abbott), TSH by DAB-RIA (Henning-Eerlin) and rT3 by RIA (Serene). FT4-/FT3-indices and T4-/Tg/TBG ratios were calculated Results: The cross-sectional study showed parameters for FT4 generally to be low normal to decreased and those for FT3 to be predominantly decreased in face of increased rT3. The longitudinal study revealed FT4 and T4/TBG as well as FT3 and T3/TBG to he in the lower normal range or decreased, mainly FT3, in both groups of patients. Basal TSH was in the lower normal range. Prior to discharge from intensivecare these parameters were significantly higher in the survivors (RT4 in the normal, TSH in the upper normal and FT3 partially in the normal range) as compared to the non-survivors. Conclusions: the clinical ~alue of FT4 and FT3 determination by RLA has been confirmed in the difficult-to-diagnose gronp of patients with severe NTI as judged from the similar performance of the indirect parameters. FT4, FT3 and basal TSH are generally rather low in severe NTI, together with the known partial inhibition of TRH-induced TEH secretion, resembling secondary hypothyroidism, most likely a secondary phenomenon to NTI. Persistence of low or decreased FT4 and FT3 and of low basal TSH may be taken as one of the indications reflecting bad prognosis in polytraum&. ",

For this purpose 0.i to 0.2 mCi of ligq is administered. In order to improve the radioiodine treatment of Graves' disease, the therapeutic dose of 1-131 is calculated according to the functional volume of the thyroid estimated from the 1-124 tomographic images. It is hoped to reduce the incidence of hypothyroidism from I-]51 treatment by adopting a scale relating the 1-131 dose to the measured lunatic nal volume. As there exist only few reports about the thyroid trapping of Tc-9gm during in vivo labeling of RBC we prospectively checked 200 routine heart studies.

The findings of the third group (n=30) are highly significant for thyroid disease : even though only half of the patients with atypical uptake in the gland could be followed up, I0 of them proved to have thyroid disease : 2 cases of hyperthyroidism and 8 cases of autonomous adenoma of the thyroid gland. So the thyroid screening during RNV was able to show in 5% of all patients signs of thyroid disease which was unknown at that time.

Raised prczcilagen-111 serum levels has been seen in different pathophysiologic conditions, especially in liver diseases (chronic active hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis). The molecule is formed in fibroblasts as a biosynthetic precursor of collagen. Therefore the N-terminal propeptide measured in the blood by a new RIA-test could be considered as an indicator for the collagen synthesis, because it is released into the circulation in equimolar proportion to the collagen type III production. We studied the influence of thyroxin on this process supposing that procollagen III formation could be indicative for the peripheric physiologic action of the thyroid hormones. In all cases of active hyperthyroidism, independently of its etiology, we observed significantly raised serum levels of prccollagen III, whereas normal values were found in euthyroid or hypothyroid patients and in cases of thyroid carcinoma. During substitution therapy with thyroxin the values raised in case of overdosage. Thus this easely performed test offers some clinical advantages in problematic cases when other parameters of thyroid function are inconclusive or altered by some reasons (e.g. false positive TSH-suppression after radioiodine therapy or in elder patients. The determination of parathormone in plasma, X-ray and other laboratory tests are often of Hmited value in diagnosing HPT. In particular with secondary HPT, the most reliable examination for this purpose is bane biopsy. But even the histological examination of bone specimen might be insufficient in individual cases, too. It was the aim of this prospective study to deterrnine quantitatively the expected increased bone metabolism and perfusion in HPT. In order to minimize the influence of kidney function bone up take was quantitafed only 6 hrs after i.v. of 0.3 mCi/ kg Te ?gin MDP in 25 normals (age 17-73 yrs) and in 15 patients (age 44-70 yrs) with histologically proven HPT. Individual ROI's were assigned to the right and left femur cesulting in c count density index: diaphysis/soFt tissue (D/S). In normals, this D/S index averaged 3.66 + 0.94 and was significantly (p<0.001) different to that of HPT patients averaging 6.37 * 1.64. This latter value is somewhat greater than reported in previous studies, which could be explained by the more accurate assignment of ROI's and the 6 hrs delayed aquisition in this study. No correlation between the serum parathormone levels and D/S index was found. Thus, quantitative bone imaging may contribute substantially and with a high specificity in diagnosing HPT, especially in cases of controversial results of standard diagnostic tests. (64%), twice (7%) right negative, four times (14%) questionably right, three times (11%) false positive and once (4%) false negative; all false results (n=4) occured in multinodular goiter; three of the four questiouably right results were chief cell hyperplasias with correct visualization of the largest gland. The sonographieal localization of extrathyroldal parathyroids was right positive in 65%, right negative in 22%, questionably right in 5% and false negative in 18%; sciutigraphy was in three cases superior to soncgraphy, never son0graphy was superior to scintigraphy.",

Adrenaline conformations, in presence of No+or K\u00f7ions wer`e determined by T 1 relaxation time measurements performed at 30\u00a30 in a 250 MHz NMR spectrometer and analysed with the DES-CARTES program. Oonformational energy maps and those of the re]ative deviation about the mean value of the correlation time ape complementary and lead to the proposal of four conformations in presence of K\u00f7;two extended and two folded. In presence of Na+there is only one conformation half-folded. These results point out that the conforrnationa{ equilibr`ium of adrenaline is per`turhed in the presence of either No\u00f7or K+ions. Since adrenaline regulates the ion flow through the sodium channels,activated by biogenic amines, its action through the change in No+and K+cor~centration might induce a shift to adrenaNne cornformation states with different affinities for the adremergJc receptor, The multiple conformation model may account for many observed phenomena in conexion with adrenaline effects. We have measured serum somatomedin (SM) and growth hormone (GH) levels with a new method in patients with active acrornegaly and GH-deficiency. Since SM is bound to carrier proteins pre-extration of SM before the radioimmunoassay (RIA) is necessary. In the previous methods both acetic acid release of SM and gelfiltration have been used before competitive protein-binding assay or RIA. In the present method heparin was used to liberate SM from the complex in the RIA. Antibodies were raised against a synthetic peptide chain which is a part of human SM molecule and the same peptide was used as a standard (calibrated against human native somatornedin C ). Separation was carried out with double antibody precipitation. Intra-assay variation was 4 % and inter-assay variation was 8 % in RIA, with pre-extraction step above i0 %.

The aim of the present investigation was to define the biological kinetics of linoleic acid anilide(LA). The fate of 3E-LA, given intragastrleally to mice~ was studied using radiotracer procedures and radiokinetic analysis. About 54% of 3E-LA was absorbed. The remaining fraction was detected in 24h feces mainly as parent compound (97%). A fraction of radiotraeer was absorbed via the lymphatic system.3H-LA radioactivity was largely distributed in the organism.Computer-fitted time activity curves showed different tissue affinities (Cmax = 164-14 ng/g of 3H-LA equivalents) followed by a slow monoexponential elimination phase, very similar for most of the organs (30 to 4Oh). 6% of the label remained in the body 4 days after dosing (tl/2 Kel = 62h). Tritium was excreted mainly in urine (40% of the dose). Biliar excretion was of minor importance. TLC autoradiography of urine showed at least 5 LA metabolites. 35% of hidrolyzed urine co-chromatographied with marked paraeetamol. These results are very similar to the previously described for 3H-CA. FAA amide bond are largely hidrolyzed by first--pass effect. Kinetic and metabolic data suggest that the tissue retention might be due to the incorporation of FAA-radioactivity to the cell membrane.

Both values were higher than 96%. Biodistrihution studies were performed on healthy CFY rats. The i.v. applied doses were 200 kBq 99Tcm-K-Str in 0.2 ml saline. The rats were sacrificed at 3, io, 60 and 180 min, after injection.

It is reported on recent experiments with FPLC-based purification of monoclonal antibodies out of ascites and of antibody fragments out of enzymatic digests. Irmmunoreactivity after radioiodination was determined by exhaustive absorption with antigen-positive melanoma cells. It was found that F(ab')2 fragments resembled very closely to intact IgG, while Fab showed lower binding rates, especially in antigenantibody systems involving modulation and internalization. The sensitivity of several monoclonal antibodies to radioiodination damage (IODO-GEN method) was evaluated as a function of the amount of iodine attached to the molecule. Two types of antibodies were encountered, one of which showing impairment of intmunoreactivity even at average substitution ratios below one atom of iodine per antibody molecule, the other tolerating higher substitution ratios. Preparations with poor immunoreactivity as determined in vitro localized very poorly to tumor tissue in vivo. The benefit of model experiments for determining the quality of a radioiodinated antibody preparation is discussed. The wide medical application of Tc-99m generators stimulates a new research. It is crucial to get a generator with high elution yields in the smallest volume of the eluate and with high percentage of pertechnetate. The hydrated electrons following the nuclear decay of Mo-99 can disturb elution even in the \"dry\" column. The redox potential of the hydrated electrons is rather high and it has been found that cupric ion can serve as a proper scavenger for them. The mixture of silica gel and alumina is a good absorbent for Tc-99m generators. This absorbent can be ~mproved with silica gel containing adsorbed copper in the quantity of about 50~g Cu/g. The Tc-99m generators activities up to 74 GBq produced by this method exhibit high elution yields and especially favourable elution profile, Tc-99m being eluted in only 3 ml of eluate.

In most pts the dilated plexus pampiniformis is visualized on the static image (ST) 7-12 min p.i. of 5mCi Tc99m in-vivo-l~Joeled erythrocytes. In this study quantification of the bloodpool in the plexus is described using the digital image of ST in 64x64 matrix. Two regions are chosen, each 2 pixels wide, A: over scrotum caudal of bulbus penis 4-10 adjacent pixels with highest counts, where number of counts in pixel with minimal counts must be equal o\u00a3 more than half of counts in pixel with maximal counts~ B: over right iliac vessels I0 adjcent pixels with maximal counts. Bloodpool value (BP) is counts/pixel in A divided by counts/pixel in B. Mean BP in 16 normals is 0.3+0.08 (0.2-0.47. Mean BP in 72 DY+ pts is 0.89+0.28 and is higher than the mean BP in Ii DY-pts (0.61+_0.19). Only 4 varicocele pts are within' the range of normals. Varicocele was in all pts confirmed by X-ray-Dhlebography. In 48 varicocele pts VS is repeated after either embolisation or ligation. SP-value in 8 DY-pts (0.58!0.i3) and 29 bY+ pts (0.90\u00b10.36),who after treatment became DY-, decreased to the same mean value, reap. 0.36+0.14 and 0.37+0.13. In the remaining 11 pts, who still were DY+ after treatment, BP decreased from 1.01+_0.38 to 0.76+0.28. The post-treatment values in these 11 pts are higher than the values of the 37 pts who became DY-. These results strongly suggest that BP is a useful measure for the varicocele-size. In pts, who after treatment still have BP>0.4, control VS probably has to be performed with valsalva.",

The purpose of the study was to evaluate radionuclide arteriography in detection of proximal arterial occlusions in lower limbs by correlating it to X-ray contrast angiography, 42 patients (83 lower limbs) with clinically suspected arterial oce~siva disease were included. A 40cm ~ infield gamma camera was placed over the pelvic and femoral region including the aortic bifurcation. A rapid antecubital injection (12 mCu) of Te99m-pertechn~e was done. Serial imaging was performed in intervals of three seconds. X-ray arteriography was performed using Seldinger percutaneous transfemoral technique or translumbar aortography. The results in detection of significant (over 50 per cent) stenoses in the aortoiliac region are as follows. Sensitivity was 27/35 (0.77) and specificity 32/47 (0.68). In case of total occlusion sensitivity was 13/13 (1.00) and specificity 64/68 (0.94). In the upper part of the femoral region the sensitivity and specificity in detection of significant stenoses were 0.57 abd O.80,respectively. The main reasons for low sensitivity in femoral region are that the adductor chanal remained outside of the gamma camera field, and the proximal occlusions interfered the visualisatien of the femoral region. Conclusion: The radionuclide arteriography is a useful noninvasive method for detection of total arterial occlusions in the aorto-iliac region. The diabetic and atherosclerotic patients have shown in previous studies some alterations in ~he ]31I-~b. build up curves executed on the feet. On the other hand new studies have shown in the same patients an alterated haematic and plasmatic viscosity. In the present work we have @cmpared the results of build up curves with ~BmTc-alb. and with 99mTc-erythrocytes on the feet and the data of haematic and plasmatic viscosity of 30 patients (12 atherosclerotics, 12 diabetics, 6 controls). The build up curves have been evaluated through the time (T a) at which they go up \"plateau\". In the control subjects t a resulted 3'30\"\u00b1 ~5\" (right foot) and 4'00\" \u00b1 45\" (lift foot) at the research with marked albumin, and 4'15\" 2 20\" (r.f.) and 4'00\" \u2022 3O\" El.f.) at the research with marked erythrocytes. In the atheroselerotles, instead, T a resulted 9'50\" \u2022 4'20\" (r.f.) and I0'15\"*2'50\" (l.f.)in the research with marked erythrocytes. In diabetics the T a resulted 13' \u00b1 2'40\" (r.f.) and 12'20\" \u00b1 2'30\" (l.f.) at the research with marked albumin, and 11'30\" \u00b1 3'10\" (r.f.) and II'25\" \u00b1 3'20\" (1.f.)at the research with marked erythrocytes. The T a resulted hlgh significantly different both in atherosclerotic and in diabetic patients compared to the control subjects (p ~ 0.0005). A significant correlation between the T a of build up curve~ with marked erythrocytes and the in vitro haematic viscosity has been found in atherosclerotio patients (p \u2022 0.01). A significant correlation between the T a of build up curves ~ith marked erythrocrees and the in vitro red cells filtrability has been also found in diabetic patients (p~ 0.01). In 1978 In and 1979 In , 1060 Danish patients with primary operable breast cancer were bone-scanned for osseous metastases before entering a nationwide therapeutical trial. A re-reading group interpreted the scans produced in 12 participating hospitals. As s consequence standardized guidelines for interpretation were agreed upon from 1979. The frequency of positive bone scans suggesting bone metastases fell abruptly from 1978 to 1979 as read both locally and by the re-reading group. ~he difference between the interpretations of the local and the re-reading groups remained statistically unchanged.",

In this way, it is possible to obtain an accurate selection of true-negative and true-positive cases. Polyelonal antibodies were raised in rabbits against the main human prostatic acid phosphabase (PAP) (enzyme A, pl 4.9), purified to homogeneity. The antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography using i~obilized pAP, and Feb fragments were purified on protein A Sepharose.

In 42 of these patients sailvary gland scintlgraphy was performed using 7.qMeq/kg 99mTe~pertechnetate before and after stimulation by D vitamin, in order to determine possible damage of the salivary glands. The patients were divided in three groups: the first group included 15 patients with residual thyroid tissue before redioiodine therapy; the second -20 patients treated with 2.96-3.7 GBq 13]1; the third -7 patients who had received over 7.4 GBq I3fl. In order to observe the influence of TSH on salivary gland function scintigraphy was per-Formed ~n g patients both on and off replacement therapy. In the patients of the first group normel salivary glands function was found. 11 patients in the second group revealed slight deterioration in accumulation in and excretion by the salivary glands. The influence of TSH was not found, In all patients in the third group abnormalities in salivary glands function was observed: from severe functional impairment to complete nonvisua]ization of the glands. In three of seven patients who were followed-up in longitudinal studies slight abnormalities in salivary glands function were established after first radioiodine therapy (2.96-3.7 gBq 1311). We found significant impairment of salivary glands Function which depends of the radioiod[ne dose received. In the study that is under way we intended to reduce the [mpalrment of salivary glands function by frequent stimulation of salivary excretion after rad[oiodlne application. The results obtained with an integrated treatment (I-131-therapy, external radiotherapy,surgery and chemotherapy) in cases of metastatic thyroid cancer over a 15 years period (198e-1983) have been evaluated\u2022 Out of 258 cases of proven thyroid carcinoma, 56 developed distant metastases. 35 of these cases were histologica! ly differentiated (18 of papillary and 27 of follicular type); io cases were undifferentlated and 1 case was of medullary type. The metastatic process affected the lung in 40 cases, bone zn 32 cases, brain and liver in 2 and adr~ nals in one. 24 patients had a single lesion, while the remains displayed multiple site metastases. From the therapeutic point of view, the key role of radioiodine therapy in treating lung metastases in which a favourable outcome in almost all cases (87.6%) occurred must be emphasized, as well as the role of the combined 1-131-therapy and telecobalt therapy in skeletel metastases. Also the surgical removal of af fecte@ bone segment was successfully used in 6 cases. Chemotherapy gave some benefit as a complement to 1-131-therapy in patients with reduced oz absent radioiodine uptake. In the undifferentiated and medullary metastatic tumors the integrated treatment was only temporarily effec five. The iO years expected survival rates (actuarial analisys) in the investigated series was as follows: The effect of some factors affecting survival in differentiated thyroid can-care limited to the thyroid (TI-T3 ITO ~i0 stages) following preventive thyroid ablation was studied in a group of 326 patients followed for I to 26 years. The absence of any extrathyroid tumor was proved by surger}j, scintimraphy in the course of thyroid ablation, and b~ scintigrephy in the phase of induced athyroidism. ~he crude survival (not corrected for see) was in the whole group 0.953/5 years, 0.833/10 years and 0.611/15 years. 14 patients died of thyroid cancer I to 15 years following treatment. The effects of age ( under and over 40 years), TI, K:I classification (T I+2 vS. T3 syndrome), of dose administred to thyroid in Oy end that of the type of surgery ~TTE vs. all other types) were found to be significant at the 5-and 10year intervals. The influences of sex, microscopic classification (papillary vs. follicular cancers), of ~qount of 131 I in GBq for thyroid ablation and of the postsurgical scan were not significant. It is believed that prevsntive thyroid ablation is an important step in the complex treatment of differentiated thyroid cancers, but its limitations should be kept in mind. Positron emission tomography (PET) of energy metabolism of the brain in man using 2-18-F-deoxyglucose (YFDG) does not distinguish between local perfusisn, facilitated transport and enzyme catalysed catabolism. In contrast, ll-Cmetbylglucose (CMB) permits separate measurements of facilitated transport (FT) and local perfusion; in conjunction with 2FDG, it promises information on enzyme catabolised eatabolism. The compound 3FDG is known to behave kinetically similarly to CMG. This paper reports on FT for CMG and 3FDG.",

In eiqht patients with schizophrenia in different stages and severity without any demonstrable vascular changes and normal transmission computed tomography findings as well as normal neurological examination IMP-Spect was performed. In all cases lesions of different size and location were observed. Patients whose symptoms were improving showed small localized areas of reduced uptake of IMP distributed all over the brain. In patients with severe symptoms of the disease extensive defects involving mainly the subcortial and central region with occasional extension into the cortex and in addition involving the region of the basal ganglia were seen, Defects in the region of the hypothalamus seemed to be of special importance not only for the assessment of the extent of the patients disease but also with respect to the patients prognosis. Reduction of the IMPuptake in the hypothalamic region correlated with an unfavourable prognosis of the disease. It is concluded: IMP-uptake defects can occur without corresponding vascular changes or anatomical destruction of the brain in patients with schizophrenia. The size of these IMP-lesions correlates directly with the clinically stated severity of the patients mental abnormalities. A lesion in the hypothalamic region may allow prognostic statements.

These compounds and several analogs were imaged with single photon emission computed tomography. Siuee ~ny of these current compounds have short residence times in the brain with T~ as low as two minutes, initially a modified Harvard Multidetector brain system was used. This system permits a high sensitivity, high resolution image of a single slice to be obtained in 54 seconds. Sequential data were collected from the single slice device to generate washout data and slices were summed to obtain images of these agents in baboon and man. Images obtained demonstrate brain uptake early after the IV injection of these compounds, but subsequent redistribution into muscular structures in the baboon model. In the patient studies obtained, early images (1-5 min) show grey matter uptake. One analog, Tc-99m BAT-eyclohexame, with a ~ in brain of 102 min was studied with Siemens ZLC 37005 rotating gamma camera in a monkey model. Work is in progress to investiHste analogs of these compounds with a more favorable residence time in the brain that would warrant further patieat studies. This study emphasizes the need for either a radiopharmaceutical with prolonged brain retention and fixed distribution or a high sensitivity SPECT instrument able to do rapid scans if a Tc-99m labeled radiopharmaaeutical for brain perfusion studies is to replace the 1-123 labeled amines.

For the management of patients (pts) with unilateral renal artery stenosis (NRAH) the relative hippuran uptake (P~U) of the affected kidney is important. However, P~U depends on the regions of interest (ROT). To elucidate the influence of the size of kidney ROI (KROI) and the place of background ROI (BROI) on RHU, renographic data of 49 by angiography proven URAS-ptS (24 leftand 25 right-sided) and 8 essential hypertensive (EH) pts were reproeessed. These data were obtained using LFOV-ga~nacamera and radiohippuran. ~ROI were generated automatically on the first 5-min frame in 64x6d matrix by determination of the distinctive intensity of the image. RHU of the affected kidney (RRUA) in NP~S-pts and EEU of the right kidney (RHUR) in EH-pts, calculated from the activity in the 2nd min using BROI between the kidneys were 31.4+10.7% resp. 49.9+ 2.3%. When fixed BROI below the kidneys was used, every enlargement of both KROI by one pixel rim resulted in an increase of RHUR by 0.5~0.6%. Compared with BROI between the kidneys, using BROI semilunararound the kidneys, correcting for each corresponding kidney,resulted in a decrease of P~UR by 2.1+2.2%. These findings indicate that the background activity of the right kidney is higher than of the left. Enlarging one KROI by one pixel rim always resulted in an increase in RBU of the corresponding kidney, although the increase is smaller if BROI was chosen between (0.8%0.8%) instead of below the kidneys(1.7+_0.7%) In comparison with BROI below the kidneys, using BROI between the kidneys had no influence on the RHU of EN-pts, but it did decrease the RHUA of URAS-pts by 1.7+i.5%. Thus, the size of KROI has less influence on RHU when BROI between the kidneys is used, moreover the discriminating capacity of ~U is probably increased. We can recommend this algorithm for the generation of KROI and the use of BROI between the kidneys, which also can automatically be deter-~ined.",

Correlation between these assays was very good. Clinical study: euthyroidism (N -75 -Ii0): the ELISA generated a basal range of ~0.8 -5.3 mU/l and, following i.v. 200 ~g TRH, a A TSH of 7.3 + 4.4 mU/l (p ~ 0.005 vs. RIA and < 0.001 vs. IRMa), the IRMA a range of 0.5 -4.0 and a~TSH of ~0.8 + 6.3 mU/1 (p < 0.0Ol vs. RIA and ELISA) and the RIA a range of < 0.8 -4.3 and a~ TSH of 8.9 + 6.0 mU/l.

In the sera of 16 pregnant women Td~T3,rT3,FT 4 adn TSH concentrations were determined by commercial kits or by using home-made reagents. Serum samples were taken during the first, the second and the third trimester of pregnancy, in each period all five tests were done and then compared with the control group of 28 euthyroid subjects at the probability level of 95%, The raised T 3 concentration during the first (2.55) , the second (3.47) and the third trimester (3.92) was found in comparison to the control group (I.97). The )eve~ of 7 4 was also elevated in a?] trimesters (140, 176, 172) i~ contrast to the mean va]ue of euthyroid group (101). The concentration of rT 3 was increased from the level of euthyroid group (0.199) to the level of 0.253, 0.68 and 0.65 which were the mean concentrations of rT 3 in the first, the second and the third trimester. On the contrary, FT 4 concentration was decreased during three pregnancy periods (1.04, 0.95, 0.675) and these values were slgnificantly different from the euthyroid level (1.28). The measurement of TSH by a very sensitive method makes it possible to differentiate hyperthyroidism from euthyroidism. During pregnamcy TSH level was not changed significantly (1.95, 2.01, 2.37) and the significant difference to the mean value of the euthyroid group (2.14) was not found. This could suggest that TSH measurement alone, determined by a precise RIA method, could easily detect hyperthyroidism and prove normal thyroid function in pregnant women in spite of elevated thyroid hormones in blood.

In hypothyroid patients, who are prone to coronary heart disease, elevated serum CK levels have been frequently do cumented. In a severe chronic hypothyroid woman (66 years of age) we found high levels of myogl~ bin, CK, LDH. While all routine heart procedures (basal and exercise electrocardiogram, vectoca~ diogram, echocardiogram) excluded a significant myocardial involvement due to the metabolic disorder, elevated serum CK-MB amounts were found (14-15 % of the total CK activity). They remained unchanged during replacement 1-thyroxine treatment, up to represent 100% of the total CK activity and concentration (CK-MB was assayed by a RIA and an In~nunoInhihition technique). After woman's CK-M~ levels were demonstrated to be actually CK-BB by means of a CK-BB RIA and, in addition, by the ITmmunoPrecipitation technique, fi nelly the electrophoresis on cellulose nitrate revealed the presence of an abnormal band between the MMandMB position, migrating together with serum ga~aglobulins (\"Atypical-CK\" or '~ cro-CK-gB\"). This finding was confirmed by the Sephadex G-200 column chromatography. Note that in this patient the \"Macro-CK-Bg\" aggregate after two years from diagnosis is still present today at the same level. In chronic hypothyroid patients especially elderly women, serum levels of \"dtypieal CK-BB\" can he present which can induce to an erroneous diagnosis of heart disease. With the aim of evidentiating the possible factors affecting serum M levels, we measured M by a very sensitive RIA (mean sensitivity 0.30 0.04 ng/tube) in 62 normal adult persons (32 men, 30 women, 16-62 yrs of age), 93 children (up to 12 yrs old), 25 newborns, 9 athletes, i0 hypothyroids, 4 acromegalics and in 25 uremics before and after dialysis. A significant ( p~ 0.01) circadian rhyt~un was found in normals, with higher M levels in the morning hours (zenith 8-10 a.m.). Children showed low M levels (10.6-6.1 ng/ml), while in newborns higher levels were found. Adult men showed significantly higher M levels (26.2 ZIO.3 ng/ml) than women (19.1 Z7.3) at 8-10 a.m. A significant correlation between body mass and M levels was found in non-obese adult men, women and athletes (r = 0.7195, n=60, p<O.Ol) at 8-10 a.m. In 6 hypoth Z roid patients M was clearly high before therapy; a signifigant inverse correlation was found between M levels and peripheral thyroid hormones.

In ur@mics, before dlalysls,we found very high M levels (229.4 ~I02 ng/ml) which he came more elevated after dialysis in most of patients (266 $124 ng/ml).

The tracer was purified with successive gel filtrations on 5ephadex G-23 and Sephadex G-iS0. The specilic activity of the tracer was 0.6 pCi/pg and it could be used for four months. For the assay, lO0 #l of diluted serum (hi0, 0.075 mol/l barbital buffer, pH g.6,with 0.25 % bovine serum albumin and 0.05 ~ NaNx) or standards (made either from purified SHBG or diluted pregnancy serum) were incubated with 200 pl o~ antiserum (i:2000, barbital buffer) and 10000 cpm of tracer (in 200 pl of barbital buffer) for 3 hours or overnight at room temperature. The bound and unbound ligands were separated by double antibody technique. The sensitivity of the assay was 0.09 mg/l and the inter-and intra-assay coefficients of variation 11.0 % and 3.7 %, respectively. In comparison with the commonly used method for estimating SHBG (dihydrotestosterone binding capacity oI serum) a close to perfect correlation was obtained (r=0.958). As measured by this radioimmunoassay, the reference limits of adult nonpregnant women were 2.7-7.3 mg/l (n=29) and those of males 0.9-3.8 mg/l (n=lO).

Some data however suggest, that handling of 99m-Tc-DMSA in the kidney takes place by glomerular filtration and subsequent reabsorption in the proximal tubular cell. The following observations support this hypothesis. Clearance studies (CI) of 99m-Tc-DMSA were performed simultaneously with 123-l-iothalamate C1 using a continuous infusion technique. Two groups of patients were studied: (l) a group (C) of 30 patients with different renal disorders, with a wide range of glomerslar filtration rate (GFR) (5-160 ml.min-I/].73 m 2) and without tubular disfunction, as measured by lysozyme CI, and (2) a group of 20 patients with proximal tubulopathy (PT) of different origin, also with a wide range of GFR and with elevated relative CI of ]ysozyme.

All patients had on angiogram stenosis of more than 50%. According to criteria of the Cooperative study of renovascular hypertension these patients were divided into 3 groups (Gr). Grl: 19 patients, who became nor~1otensive; Gr2:26 patients, who improved and St3:27 patients, who showed no response on PTA. Renography was performed in supine position with large-field qarmnacame\u00a3a posteriorly using orthoiodohippurate. Renographic data were collected in 20-see frames and regions of interest were defined with a light-pen. Background areas were chosen below the kidney. From the affected kidney two parameters were obtained. The Relative Hippuran Uptake (RHU), calculated from the integral counts of the second minute and the Difference of Time to Peak (DTP) to the contralateral kidney. DTP <] min was considered to be normal. The results are qiven in the table. Patients with RHU between 35-44% had the best prognosis. Most of the nan responders had RHUvalues >45%; this probably indicates that the stenosis was of no hemodynamic consequence or pathology of the contralateral kidney. In 7 patients with RHU <25% (2 p~tients of Gr3, in whom the stenosis was successfully dilated and in 5 other patients, in whom PTA was not possible) nephrectomy resulted in normalization or improvement of the bloodpressure. We conclude that PJiU is a useful discriminator for the management of URAS-patients, while prolongation of time to peak (DTP ~i min) does not predict the bloodpressure response on PTA.",

Linear regression analysis was done separately for the age groups 3.5 -15 and 16 -75 years and for both sexes. I) Age 16 -75 years: 243 males and 181 females were considered as normal with respect to renal function. Regression analysis yielded men: C : 670-3.3x (r:-0.38, s:124) (ml/min), women: C = 617-3.3x (r=-0.42, s=I04), x = years, s = standard error. ~he level of signifieanee of the difference in clearance between both sexes was slightly above 5%. 2) Age 3.5 -15 years: 20 cases were considered as normal. Within this small number no significant correlation of C with age was found. The mean (\u00b1 s) was C = 577 \u00b1 88 ml/min. 3) Plotting all available data from literature as a function of age, our normal values of tubular clearance fit in quite well. After a steep rise between birth and 3 years there seems to be a plateau until maturity. Thereafter tubular clearance declines gradually, the averages of the females being about 10% less than those of men. 4) A normal range can be deduced as C \u00b1 1.65s, C being the regression line or the constant value in the respective groups(90~ confidence interval). C.Bianchi,C.Donadio,G.Tramonti, F.Lorusso,R.guzzardi Many low molecular weight proteins (calcitonin,insulin,glucagon,lysozyme, ~2-microglobulin)are removed from the hlood by the kidney where they accumulate without being eliminated with the urine. The measurement of renal clearance of such molecules needs renal veins catheterization.We are now applying a new noninvasive method for the measurement of the renal clearance of Aprotinin(Ap)~labelied with Tc99m.Ap is a small protein (6500 dalton) which inhibits some proteo lyric enzymes such as trypsin and kalli~ krein.We have already validated Ap-Tcg\u00a3m ~sa tracer for reDalsdSntigrap[,s~nce Tt~s ~Ig~ly and s ta~-ly accumulated ~n the kidney with minimal urinary excretion.Renal clearance of Ap(and of other low molecular weight proteins with similar renal handling) can be determined during continuous venous infusion of Ap-Tc99m as: AK Cl= t2 P(t) dt where:~K is the increase of the radioactivity ove~ each kidney measured by external counting and corrected fo~ tissue attenuation, and P is the plasma concentration of Ap-Tcggm. We have studied 5 subjects with normal ~enal function and 1 patient with advanced renal failure. In normal suhjeets renal clearance o\u00a3 Ap-Tcggm was about half of the ERR.In the patient with renal failure the values of ~enal clearance of Ap-Tcggm and GFR were similar.This method could give noninvasively the unilateral renal clea ~anee of low molecular weight proteins-handled by the kidney. A renogram without any excretion of OIH into the bladder is up to a factor equal to the integral of the time activity curve of the cc~ti~ent, frc~ which OIH is extracted by the kidneys. An algorythm is proposed, which allowes the mathematical reconstruction of this curve, which is shown to be a two ex~tial function of time. Using Sapirsteins model of OIH kinetics, the transition rates are calculated.simultaneously, the renal clearance is determined using whole body principles. Thus, the vascular vol~me of OIH is given by the quotient of clearance and clearance transition rate. The extravascular volume is calculated from the vascular volume and the intercoRioartmental transition rates.",

For optimum volume substitution therapy in cardiac risk patients during and after greater surgery the estimation of the patients individual LV pressurevolume characteristics (Frank Starling curve) is essential. Because of the complex and non-linear pressure-volume relationship the measurement of the LV filling pressure (PCWP) is not sufficient. Therefore, in this study PCWP was gradually increased up to 15-18 mm Hg by stepwise infusion of 5% albumine in I0 cardiac risk patients in 6 times 200 ml increments. At each volume loading level, PCWP along with the radionuclide equilibrium ejection fraction (iF) and thermodilutlon stroke volume index (SVI) were determined, and the LV enddiastolic volume index (EDVI) was calculated by EDVI=SVI/EF. Unexpectedly, there was a relative uniform preloadvolume-pressure response in all but one patient, with an only moderate but non-significant increase of the EOV[ and SVI and a significant rise of PCWP, despite an always normal EF.

Lipophylic cations labelled with IIC or 123 iodine provide attractive alternative for myocardial imaging in man. In this study, we have evaluated the kinetics of 2 such tracers 125 i-IPBDA (iodophenylbenzyldimethylammonium) and 11C MTP (methyItriphenylphosphonium), their myocardial extraction, their tissue distribution and their relationship to myocardial blood flow. 15 open-chested dogs were studied. IPBDA first pass myocardial extraction was 73% in normal myocardium (mean blood flow 95 ml/min/100g) but decreased to 40% with dipyridamole (mean blood flow 227ml/min/10Og). The tissue IPBDA concentration correlated with myocardial blood flow distribution (r=. 81) but the relationship was curvilinear reflecting a decreased extraction fraction with high flow. IIC MTP distribution was measured by PET and compared to 68 Gallium mierospheres. The normalized distribution of both tracers correlated linearily (r-. 86) and areas of myocardial infarc tion could be identified by both tracers. MTP activity in the myocardium was stable for more than 40 minutes. We conclude that lipophylic cations are myocardial tracers with potentials to evaluate myocardial blood flow distribution in man. Knc~ledge of my_ocaxdial Derfusion, metabolism and function is essential for a comprehensive concept of the state of the myocardium. In this study, myocardi~ metabolism was studied with 18-F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG} and occasionally with 123-1-heptadecanoic acid (HDA). 201-thallium (TI) was used for studies of myocarclial perfusion. We have studied 23 cardiac patients with 10-50 MBq FDG using an ordinary gamma c~m~_ra with a one-inch crystal and a collimator designed for detecting high-energy photons. The patients fasted for approximately 12 hours before the FDO study. _Myocardial perfusion studies were done using 75 -~ 2Ol-thallium and a rotating dual head ganm~ c/m~ra. The patients suffered frc~ various heart diseases, the largest group consisted of patients with acute and old myocardial infarctions. The patients with acute end old heart infarctions without complications showed decreased acctwaulation of T1, HDA and FDG into the infarction area. Contrary to this, a patient with persistent chest pain treated with intracoronsx streptokinase showed decreased accumulation of TI, }DA and FDG one week after the infarction but one month later FDG images showed increased uptake into the infarction area, whereas T1 and HDA were nearly norn~lly distributed. A patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy showed heterogenous myocardial distributions of TI, FEG and HDA. Patients with coronary artery disease showed more pronounced changes in myocardial FDG uptake ~d to TI. The FDG images produced by an ordinary ganma camera revealed regional FDG changes in the myocerdium. This work shows that an inexpensive gauma camera can be used to roughly depict FDG distribution in the myocardi~m.

For th~ second calculation it zs necessary to evaluate the time-activity curve which is given by different blood samples taken during a period of about 14 days of a Fe-59-study. We determined the conventional values: the turnover rate of zron and the degree of utilisation. And using the initial decrease of iron in plasma and the slope of the later reentry of Fe-59 bound to newly formed h~moglobin ~e demonstrate in this paper how one can develope out of a fit of this curves the translt time of iron through the bone marrow, the dayly h~moglobin formation and the potential lifetime of erythrocytes. On several groups of patients with different anemic disorders: l) h~molytic anemia, 2) primary and secondary h~mochromatosis and 3) e\u00d7tramedullary h~moglobin formation this method has been validated. The concentrations of the above substances were determined in the plasma and supernatants of leukaemic cell culture from 38 patients with acute myeloblastie leukaemia /aml/, 20with chronic granulocytic leukaemia /cgl/ and 20 healthy persons /control group/. The prostaglandin level was determined b F means of Clinical Assays /USA/ RIA kits and cyclic nucleotide concentration with Amersham /England/ RIA kits. The results obtained showed that the plasma PGE level was high both in aml and cgl but the PGFt~ level was only high in cgl and with-%xaeerbation of this disease increased considerably. The level of cA~ was also high in beth diseases but the cGMP level was highest in egl /particulary in the states of exacerbation/ and the lowest in patients with aml. The PGE supernatant concentration was significantly higher in aml than in the cgl and in the control. The values of PGFt~ were high in cgl, but in aml were lowet--than in the control. Contrasting behaviour of the cyclic nucleotide concentration was noted in the supernatants of leukaemie cells; in aml, the highest cA~ values accomoanied cG~ values below these of the controls. The reverse was observed in cgl. It is felt that the findings regarding known ir~hibitors /PGE,cAt~/ and stimulators /PGFc~, eG~,~/ of cell proliferation have cont~k~buted to our knowledge of disturbances in leukaemic cell metabolism, which may be of value in diagnostics and treatment monitoring. Department of Haematology,Medical School 15-276 Bia~ystok, 2oland. The investigations were carried out in 30 patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia /~al/,15 with chronic granulocytic leukaemia /cgl/,18 with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia /ell/.The control group consisted of 20 healthy persons. In all patients the values of blood pres sure,glomerular filtration rate,sodium, potassium,creatinine and protein levels in the plasma and sodium concentration in the urine were in the normal range, There were no haemorrhages and evident disturbances in blood coagulation. The pra and pcal were determined by means of CIS /France/ RIA kits but the concentration of 6-keto-PGF1~and TXB 2 by the NEN /USA/ RIA kits. The results showed that the pra and peal during remission periods in the types of leukaemia studied did not differ from those of the control group but in the pe riods of exacerbation increased 5-8 times. The concentration of 6-keto-PGF1~ was high in all the leukaemias in comparison with the control group. The highest values were observed in patients with exacerbation of the disease. The plasma TXB m level was normal in the remission perihds and increased during the periods of exacerbation. It is possible that the increase in nonspecific pro tease activity accompanying exacerbation of leukaemias is the cause of the increase in pra and peal. The high 6-keto-~GF~m values indicate a high prostaglandin'~evel which by raising the c~,~ level probably prevents excessive cell proliferation in cgl and in aml enhances the differentiation of cells. The study was carried out in 28 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes and in 33 healthy controis of similar age, sex and weight. Diabetic patients exhibited significantly higher plasma levels of bo~h ,6-TG and PF4 in eomparism to normal controls and a positive correlation between plasma (~-TG and PF4 was found (r=O.g?, pt0.001, n=28) .",

The effect of blood donations on iron stores has been evaluated in 500 donors, 118 males and 382 females, by measuring serum ferritin (S.F.) by R.I.A. The control group included 302 controls, 120 males and 182 females. Values $12 ngrs/ml we re regarded as indicative of iron stores depletion (I.S.D.). In the male control group, the mean 3.F. was 147.0 ~ 99.7 whereas in the male donors group it was 97 ~ 127 and the significance level of the means was p < 0.001 In females. the mean in the control grouo was 42,g 4 57 and in donors 2g.l ! 3g.l The number of males with S.F. ~ 12 ngrs/ml was 1/120 (0.8%) in the control group and 4/118 (3.a%) in the donors ~roup. The number of females with S.F. ~ ig ngrs/ml was 43/g2 (23.6%) in the control group and 118/382 (30.8%) in the donors group. When the females of the control ~roup were classified according to age, there was a 26.4% with I.S.D. in the sub group below 45 years and 11.8% in the subgroup above that ageo In females of the donors group there was I.S.D. in 34.6% (72/208) in the subgroup below 45 years and gg.4% (46/174) in the subg\u00a3oup above 45 years. In the group of females 25 years the incidence was 41.9% (34/81) and 20.3% (13/g4) in the group above 55 years (p < 0.01). gccording to the time interval (months) between donations the incidence of I.S.D. was 42% (< 4 months), 33.5% (4-6), 27.8% (6-8), 23.3% (8-10) and 15.5% (> i0 months). We conclude : I) The incidence of I.S.D. increases as the interval between donations decreases 2) The incidence of I.S.D. is higher in the young groups than i~ old groups, 3) S.F. is a parameter of great value to prevent iron defieie~ cy anemia in blood donor. Two cc,mercial inwnunoradicmetric assays, one using monoclonal antibodies to spleen ferritin ~/t selected to react with both liver and spleen ferritin, the other using polyclonal antibodies tO liver ferritin, were used to measure ferriti~ content in serb~ and figured blood elements in 20 normal subjects. For sert~n and erythrocyte ferritin a highly significant linear correlation between the results of both assays was found (r>0.95) . For granulocytes end mononuclear cells, hcwever, lower linear correlation coefficients w~re observed (r>0.8). According to the type of sample different reqression slopes were observe~ in sertwa the results for both assays did not differ significantly (slope 1.08) ; in red cells there was a marked decrease in response of the monoclonal antibody (MA) assay oampared to the polyclonal (PA) assay (slope 0.27). These ~sults indicate the nonrecognition of part of the erythrocyte ferritin by the ~lq. It has been shown that red blood cells contain two immunological different ferritins. The difference observed between both assays could be explained by amonospecificity of the MA for tile spleen-type,which is also the most abundant ferritin type in the sezl~n. An additional ar~ent for this is that the median erythrocyte ferritin content found in the present study with the MA is nearly identical to the values obtained by other authors using polyclonsl antiboOties specific for basic ferritin. Ferritin Contents in granulocytes and memonuclear cells were significantly lower with MA. This could be the result of a different cellular isoferritin oclnposition with respect to sertwa and erythrocytes or of a different oanposition ~nonocytes,l~mphocytes) for the mononuclear cell samples. These findings indicate that both assays are equivalent for the assay of seru~ ferritin, but not for figured blood elements. A high specificity of the MA for basic liver type ferritin is also suggested.",

Changing the antiserum specificity of a RIA system is known to be a potential cause of con-cern~ by possibly altering the response of calibrators, samples and controls. Most often, patient samples and commercial controls react in a similar manner to this changed specificity. However, this needs not necessarily to be the case. We report two antiserum changes which were accompanied by sometimes dramatic alterations in the apparent analyte content of several control preparations, while the findings for patient serum samples were unaffected. The assays involved were: a direct estradiol assay (EIR, W~renlingen, Switzerland) and a TSH assay (Amersham International, UK). The differences in apparent analyte content, compared to the previous titration, ranged from 85 to 179% for the estradiol kit and from 27 to 123% for the TSH kit. In both cases, no significant difference could be demonstrated regarding the assays of patient serum samples. It is interesting to note that, in the case of TSH, the antiserum change affected not only commercial internal quality control (QC) preparations, but also samples from external QC programs, such as the Wellcome control program and the Belgian official external QC scheme. The assay resul~s being pooled in such programs, important biases are to be anticipated. The reported discrepancies were ascribed to the fact that, in control preparations, analytes may not be present in the native form, but also as a metabolite, a subunit, a degradation product or even as a non-human analog. This difference in composition as compared to true, not degradated human sere must be regarded as a major cause of a different hehaviour of these control preparations with respect to the change in antiserum specificity.

This assay is a suitable method for measuring the titer and the cross-reactions of different batches of antibodies to collagens. A competitive binding receptor radioassay for 1,25(0H) 2 vitamin D, with sufficient sensitivity for studying maternal and foetal (cord serum) levels, from a few millilitres of serum has been developed. High specific activity tritiated tracer 1,25(0H) 2 D and standard or serum e~tract are allowed to react with intestinal receptor in a total volume of 150 U1 10% ethano]ic 0.05 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The reaction is terminated by adding 40% polyethylene glycol, the receptor-ligand complex spun down and the supernatant counted. The standard curve is plotted as free/total counts vs. total assay concentration. The CVs were 11% and 15% (intra-, interassay). Using high pressure liquid chromatography with ~H-tracers for 25-OH D and 24,25(0N) 2 D a total of 21 cord and 82 pregnancy sere were analysed. Foetal 1,25(0H) 2 D levels (mean 77, range 23-159 pmol/l) were less than normal adult levels (105, 30-150+, p< 0.05) and pregnancy levels were higher than both these (169, 39-291, p< 0.01, and < 0.001). Diabetic mothers had lower 1,25(OH)2D levels than all other mothers taken together (p < 0.01). At cord 1,25(0H) 2 D levels > 110 pmol/l the babies were larger (p < 0.02). Cord 1,25(OH) 2 D levels correlated positively with 25-0H D levels (p< 0.05). These patterns were not seen in pregnancy serum but at higher 25-0H D and 24,25(OH) 2 D levels babies were larger (p< 0.01 to < 0.04). 25-0H D correlated with 24,25(OH)2D (p< 0.001) and the regression of the former on the latter in pregnancy serum showed that 25-OH D was 18 nmol/] when 24,25 (OH)2 D had fallen to zero (p < 0.001). This suggests preferential use by the foetus of the latter, perhaps in the maturing skeleton. Specific radioimmunoassays have permitted accurate measurement of variations in plasma hormonal levels over the 24-h-cycle. Free or unbound cortisol in plasma is the biologically active form at the tissue and cellular level. It moves freely out of the bloodstream into tissue cells where it acts. As there are not binding-proteins, the determination of cortisol levels in saliva seems to offer a number of significant advantages as compared with plasma or serum measurements, and radieimmunoassay is the technique of choice.",

The eormnonest site of growth plate arrest is the distal femoral or proximal tibial growth plate.

TI-201-scintigraphy has been reported to be useful in the detection of metastases from thyroid carcinoma after thyroidectomy. To evalmate the reliability of this procedure T1-201 total body scintigraphy was performed in 218 patients,after total thyroidectomy for histologically proven thyroid carcinoma. Results were correlated with 1-131 scintigraphy and tumormarker levels(Tbg or Calcitonin/CEA). TI-201 scintigraphy correctly demonstrated tumor localizations in 16 of 19 patients with 1-131positive metastases. In 4 cases the TI-201-scintigram and in 4 other cases the 1-131-scintigram showed more localizations. T]-201 total body scintigraphy was negative in 150 patients with no evidence of disease,however 9 of these patients had elevated tumormarker levels. In 26 patients TI-201 total body scintigraphy revealed metastases which did not concentrate 1-131. In 16 of these patients only tumormarkers indicated disease. M~tastases have sofar been confirmed in 16 patients. 7 of 13 patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma had elevated levels of Calcitonin and/or CEA. In 5 of these patients metastases were localized by means of TI-2Ol-scintigraphy, Comparison of Tl-201, 1-131 and tumormarkers showed that none of these parameters alone is completely reliable in follow up of thyroid carcinoma. However the combination of a negative TI-201-scintigram with a negative tumormarker was never associated with disease in our series. It is concluded that: I) TI-2Ol total body scintigraphy is a useful parameter in postoperative thyroid carcinoma, especially when a discrepancy of the other parameters exists; 2) TI-2Ol-scintigraphy is of particular use in medullary thyroid carcinoma; 3) in follow up of patients who are unsuspected of disease after suceesful therapy for thyroid carcinoma one can rely on T1-201 total body scintigraphy when tumormarker levels are low or undetectable. In papillary and follicular carcinoma of the thyroid gland scintigraphy with 13]-I and thyreoglohulin (TG) measurements in plasma are unique tools for the detection of recurrence or metastases. Recently the uptake of 20J-T1 in thyroid cancer has been reported as a complementary scintigraphic technique. He did a comparative study of these three diagnostic tests (seintigraphy with 13]-I, measurement of TG and scintigraphy with 201-TI) (n=71) in 60 patients with papillary or follicular carcinoma. This was a selected group of patients with suspicion of recurrence or metastases (elevated TG or suspicious mass) after total thyroidectomy and 131-I ablation therapy. Total body scintigraphy using ]31-I was performed 2 weeks after T-3 withdrawal. 20J-T1 scintlgraphy was done (one day before 131-I scintigraphy) ~0-50 min. after i.v. injection of 30-70 MEg 20[-TICI. TG was measured using a radioin~uunoassay (upper limit of normal : 60 ng/ml off T-3).",

After new tumour markers in serum had been introduced the question arose whether also patients with turnouts of the urinary tract would benefit from this development. We assessed the clinical value of a series of tumour markers in the serum of 79 patients who had a carcinoma of the kidney, prostatic gland, or testis. During follow-up of 18 patients with renal carcinoma, 30 with prostatic carcinoma, and 31 with testicular carcinoma, the serum level of ferritin, prolactin, 13-HCG, CEA, CA 12-5, CA 19-9, TPA, AFP, and, as a supplement in the patients with prostatic carcinoma, prostatic acid phosphatase was measured by radiolmmunoassay. Among the patients who suffered from renal carcinoma, serum ferdtin had increased in 16, prolactin in 8, TPA in 7, CA 12-5 in 3, AFP in 2, and CEA in one whereas prolactin was reduced in 2 patients. In the patients with prostatic carcinoma, serum TPA was elevated in 22, prolactln in 21, ferritin in 16, CEA in I0, AFP and 8-HCG each in one man; serum prolactin had decreased in one patient.

The aim of our study was to establish the clinical value of this method in the follow-up of patients wi~h cerebro-vascular disease after therapy. Patients: 74 with cerebro-vascular disease, 21'before and after surgery. Method: 5 mCi 123-I-AMP i,v. SPECT was started after 3o min. using a rotating gammacamer (G.E. 4ooTl. Results: The tomographie clices show a marked 123-I-AMP accumulation in the grey watter and lower activity in the white matter. Activity in the cerebellum could also be detected. There are typicalpatterns of perfusion defects which correlate to the occluded cerebral arteries. The lesions were usually more pronounced in SPBCT then in CT. Besides showing areas of major infarction seen on CT scaus, SPECT is able to detect the areas of borderline perfusion between different vascular territories. The defects correlated closely to the neurological symptoms. After surgical intervention a better accumulation in the corresponding hemisphere could be registered in the majority of cases. Patients with extra-intra-craniel bypass show local hyperaemia at the site of the anastomosis. We conclude that 123-I-AMP gPECT of the brain is a promising noninvasive method for the follow-up and therapy control of patients with cerebro-vascular disease. The clinical NPH features usually comprise a disorder of stance and gait, urinary urgency and incontinence and intellectual disorders, abulia or psychomotor retardation. In the past years many authors have attempted to define reliable criteria to select patients who might benefit from CSF shunting, Cisternography, showing persistent ventricular reflux, impaired conductance outflow of C.S.F. and, CT demonstrating enlarged ventricles and CSF migration through the wails, were unreliable criteria to predict outcome after shunting. We applied 1-123 IMP tomoscintigraphy to 17 patients (10 females mean age: 70.1, 7 males mean age: 6#.5) with suspected NPH. 6 to 7 mCi of 1-123 IMP (CIS France) were injected intravenously (eyes closed and ears plugged) before and after CSF lumbar withdrawal (10 to 60 co). Imaging was performed with a rotating gamma camera (CGR) from 20 to 60 rain after injection. Like MATHEW and GRUB8, our results demonstrated that frontal and frontoparietal regions were affected to a greater extent along with a decrease in basal ganglia activity. After CSF drainage, cortical perfusion was improved on g patients with a good correlation (7/g) with clinical criteria (mental disorders assessed by psychometric tests, gait disturbance and urinary incontinence); the correlation was poor with CT findings except perlventricutar lueency. 9 patients were shunted, one recently, 7 patients upon S were cEnicaliy improved after CSF permanent shunting, had a concomittent improvement of cortical perfusion after CSE drainage test and was a better criterion than clinical appreciation of this drainage, Assessment of regional perfusion with 1-123 IMP before and after CSF drainage may provide objective information concerning the suitability of NPH patients for CSF shunting. In about one third of TIA or stroke patients the angiography is normal or shows only slight atherosclerotic lesions. Nevertheless, in these patients the long term prognosis is as bad as for patients with carotid disease.

Box 60500, S-I04 Ol STOCKHOLM Leucocytes labelled with lll-lndium have been used to visualize inflammatory lesions in ulcerative colitis (UC) and in Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to compare findings by scintigraphy, radiology and endoscopy in patients with slightly or moderately active disease. Material: UC: Twelve patients (median age 36 yrs ~weYe studied. All were non-febrile, 8 recieved sulphasalazine,none steroids. CD: Fifteen patients (median age 46 yrs.F/M:7P3Ywere studied. A11 were non-febrile, two recieved prednisolone 5 mg/daily, 8 sulphasalazine. Methods: Leucocytes were labelled with lll-ln-Oxine (0.15-0.67 mCi) and given i.v. Scintigrams were obtained 3 and 24 hrs. p.i. Double contrast x-ray studies of the colon and small intestine were done after 2 and 14 days respectively. Colonoscopy with multiple biopsy was done after 4 days. Results: Active lesions were found in 24 of 27 patients. Location and extension of the lesions were in some cases masked of the intreluminal activity on scintigrams ~4 hrs. p.i. Excretion in the stools were 2.4-25.8% of administered activity, Compared with scintigraphy a corresponding extension and location was found with colonoscopy. In 4 patients with UC x-ray of the colon was normal but scintigraphy and colonoscopy showed active inflammation. Conclusion: Scintigraphy after injection of Ill-In labelled leucocytes is an atraumatic method for visualization of inflammatory lesions in UC and CD. The location and extension of inflammatory lesions can be visualized and the method appears more sensitive than conventional x-ray studies. ",

In 4/5 patients with the final diagnosis of brain abscess leucocyte scintigraphydemonstratedmarkedly increased activity corresponding to the lesion detected by CT -in the fourth patient a small central lesion could not be demonstrated. This patient i~ad, however, been successfully treated with antibiotics for 8 days. In I0/II patients with the final diagnosis of a malignant brain tumor, leucocyte scintigraphy was negative, in one patient with a large superficial malignant tumor with extensive meningeal engagement, activity corresponding to the ttuaor was, however, seen. This gives an overall accuracy of 14/16 (88%). Leucocyte scintigraphy thus has an important role in the differential diagnosis between brain tumor and brain abscess. The kinetics of 111-In oxine labelled platelets were studied in thrombopenic purpura. The advantage of 111-1n over 51-Cr is that it can be used in autotransfusien however severe the thrombocytopenia may be and that sites of platelet destruction can be visualized with a scintillation camera peaked for 170 and 245 key with a 20 % window. Normal autologeus 111-Ie labelled platelet distribution was tested in 6 volunteer controls. 180 cases of thrombopenic purpura (176 idiopathic thrombopenic purpuras ; 4 congenital thrombocytopenias) were investigated. Fourteen patients underwent a double exploration : one with autologous 111-In labelled platelets and the other with donor 51-Cr labelled platelets. The patients entered into this study were investigated at least three weeks after any treatment. The exploration protocol included counting the radioactivity of blood samples for platelet survival. A scintillation camera interfaced with an image processing system was used to study early in viva platelet distribution and late hepato-splenie sequestration. Scintigraphic imaging techniques give a precise description of the early kinetics of hepatosplenic pooling. This is useful when making a differential diagnosis between thrombopenic purpura and hypersplenism. They also enable the relative importance of the sites of destruction to be assessed : in this study purely splenic uptake : 85 % of cases, purely hepatic uptake : 5 Z of cases, mixed hepato-splenic uptake : 10 % of cases. The method is useful in confirming the diagnosis of idiopathic thrombopenic purpure, in quantifying the degree of platelet destruction and in indicating whether the patient is eligible for surgery. The kinetics of autologous lll-In-labelled platelets (pl.) were studied in 50 patients with thromhocytopenia (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) : 27 patients; congestive splenomegaly (CS) accc~qganying chronic hepatic disease: 18 patients; splenomegaly frcm other causes: 5 patients) . In the ITP group, pl. mea~_ life thee (MLT) was considerably shortened (x = 45 h) , in viva recovery (IVR) was slightly lowered (x = 45%) , and pl. turnover slightly increased (~ = 66700 pl./pl/24h), however, all 3 parametres showing considerable interindividual variation. In the CS group, the mean values were: MLT: 124h; IVR: 31%; pl. turnover: 44477 pl./pl/24h. No correlation was found between MLT and pl. concentration in blood in any of the two groups. Platelet turnover was positively correlated to the pl. concentration in the spler~smegaly group; these two parametres did not correlate in the ITP group, suggesting subnormal tbrc~nbopoiesis in both groups. The pl. concentration was positively correlated to IVR in both groups. This was expected in the splenc~egaly group; in the ITP group it may reflect increased vulnerability of platelets frcrn patients severely affected, resulting in pro{nature removal of labelled platelets from the circulation upon reinjection. Alternatively, it may reflect ir~reased platelet pooling in I~P, contributing to throalbocytopenia. This is supported by a positive correlation between IVR and spleen size in both groups. Scintigraphic studies: In the splenomegaly group, pl. seq~/estration and destruction occurred almost exclusively in the spleen. The ITP patients could be divided into 2 groups; one (n = 15) erdzibited a predc~ninantly splenic platelet destruction, the other showed signs of a ccmbined splenic-hepatic or hepatic pl. destruction. In both groups (ITP and CS) scintigraphic stmdies of the chest revealed signs of pl. destruction in the home rq~rrow as well.",

The results showed that planar images Which were of poor photon flux produced much better reconstructions when pro-filtered, whereas the difference was not nearly so d~amatic with high photon flux studies. Therefore, we recommend routine pre-reconstruction three dimensional filtering on all SPECT studies, especially those of poor photon flux. In fact in some very low photon flux 24 hour CSF, Thallium and Gallium studies, it was only possible to interpret those images when prefiltered first. The design and initial performance characteristics of the original dynamic phantom for quality control checks of camera/ computer systems are presented. The phantom consists of two rubber balloons filled with Tc-99m solution. The balloons intended to simulate heart chambersare filled and emptied periodically by means of two pistons that are operated by specially shaped cam discs situated on the common shaft driven by a motor. An ECG trigger pulse simalating the R wave in cardiac studies is generated for each rotation at a position equivalent to enddiastole. Both balloons are placed in e water bath in a glass vessel containing Te-99m to provide simulate\u00a2} body background activity. The phase delay in filliDg of balloons can be adjusted by the mutual turning the cam discs through an angle desired. Knowing the true characteristics of the phantom arrangement, e.g. left ventricular ejection fraction, end-diastolic Volume~ end-systollc volume, cardiac output, systolic emptying and diastolic filling rate etc., it is possible to compare these values against those observed and computed. Experience with this dynamic phantom has dem@mstrated that it is a very valuable tool in testing overall gated acquisition system performance, including hardware, and computer programs used for the analysis of cardiac radiomuclids data. Examples of the use of the phantom are given end its advantages in comparison with other ones described in literature are discussed. and I \"basenear\" was imaged in air with 360\u00b0and 180\u00b0revolution.After back-projection(Ham/ning-filter) in transverse slices and reorientation to sagittal,frontal and oblique planes, som~ small blurring was noticed in the 18C-data.All 3 defects could easily identified by reduction in count activity to 25-30% in the defects containing no activity. In a water tank with scatter the 360 data showed without attenuation correction a decrease of activity from the apex to the base to 55-60%.In the 180\u00b0data attenuation caused a activity decrease to 40-50% in the base compared to the apex. Contrast however was better in the 180\u00b0data compared to the 360\u00b0-data:~he apexnear defect showed in the 180-data a decrease of activity to 25-35% and in the 360\u00b0data to 35-45%,the midventricular defect showed in the 180 \u00b0 data a diminution to 30-35% vers 50-55% in the 360 data,the basenear defect was lowered to 35-45% in-~e 180\u00b0data and to 55-60% in hhe 360\u00b0d~ta.Attenuation correction for the 360 data did not change v the contrast,but lowered the activity loss in the base to 80%. In a preliminary study of 12 pat.with either 9osterior-posterobasal ischemia or infarction,we could clearl X demonstrate the sufficiency of the 180~rotation (RAO-LPO)without attenuation correction in TL-2OI-SPECT. We conclude,that myocardial TL-2OI-SPECT can be eva~uated with certain precaution in the 18C--rotation offering more contrast. Dep The Siemen's orbiter 3700S single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) system can acquire tomographic images in both step-andshoot and continuous-rotation modes. We have compared these modes in scanning patients and phantoms. For a study requiring 360 \u00b0 rotation, a brain scan was selected. After a 20-mCi injection of Tc-99m gl~coheptonate, a continuousrotation study was followed by a step-and-shoot study. The same number of counts were recorded at 2 \u00b0 intervals for 180 projections. For the study requiring 180 \u00b0 of rotation, a cardiac exam was selected. After a 2-mOi intravenous injection of thallium-201, continuous rotation through 180 \u00b0 was compared to a subsequent study in the step-and-shoot mode. For both modes the same number of counts were recqrded at 20 intervals for 90 projections. The resulting images were the same for both scan modes, but total scanning time was longer with step-and-shoot than with continuous rotation (27 mid vs. 18 for 180 views in 360 \u00b0 and 22 mfn vs. 18 for 90 views in 180\u00b0). This difference between the modes was due to the time interval required each time the camera head was moved from one angle to another for the step-and-shoot mode. This time difference is directly related to the number of views collected or the total number of angles sampled. In conclusion, the continuous-rotation mode is preferable due to shorter patient imaging time for SPECT study without degrading the image quality. Summation of data from multiple continuous-rotations would be preferable when it is uncertain how long a patient can remain immohile for the exami~atio~ or when distribution of the radiopharmaeeutical being investigated would change during a slower rotation. imaging has been utilized in diagnostic radiology for years.

Lack of divergence in the images due to a parallel hole collimator slightly distorts the stereoscopic effect. Respiration induced organ motions during NMR data acquisition reduce the contrast of images. Therefore the recording of spin echo sequences is done while the patients hold their breath. The period of stopped respiration has to be detected for controlling data acquisition. Because the patients cannot hold their breath longer than a few seconds only some of the 128 image projections are recorded every nonbreathing period. This paper deals with trigger pulse generation derived from different temperatures of inspired and expired ai~ flow. g small thermistor located inside a breathing mask is used to measure the changing temperature. This sensor type provided with twisted and shielded leads and RF filter circuits has proved to pick up little RF and magnetic field gradient switching noise in NMH environment. Transitions between respiration periods are identified by sudden gradient changes of the measured temperature-time function. Different temperature gradients at transition time are used in the device to distinguisch between normal and non-breathing periods. If respiration is stopped the NMR imbuing procedure is released via ECG trigger channel for an appropriate number of sequences recordings. When imaging the beating heart at the non-breathing period the standard ECG equipment output line is connected via the device to the imaging system ECG channel as long as respiration is stopped.

Bauer TI and T2 relaxation times are inherent characteristics of different tissue. It is anticipated that some pathologies and malignancies can be differentiated by their respective relaxation times. A prerequisite to discriminate tissue alterations is an exact and reproducible measurement of TI times. Data published in literature differ widely even when measured at the same field strength. This uncertainty might be due to I) the statistical error which is potentiated in calculating TI times when large numbers are subtracted \u00a3r0m each ether 2) the spin lattice relaxation time being not monoexponential but more complex and 3) hence different pulse sequences and repetition times tR result in unequal weighting of the respective TI times, producing deviating 'mean' TI times. Applying inversion echo sequences and 2-dimensional FT reeonstruetion~ we determined the inversion delay ~ at which the resonance signal was zero. From r o , TI was calculated iteratively according to T1i = ~o/in(2-exp(-t/T1i-1)(2-exp(-~e/T1i-1))) with re being the echo delay and t = t~-E=-rm the relaxation period. The '~-method' is insensitive to statistical errors and results in reproducible Imean TI times' when tissue with complex relaxation characteristics is investigated. Measurements were performed at the Hausst~n Clinic, using a resistive system (Teslacon M Technicare) at 0.15 T. Some TI times (ms) are given below (mean ~ SD, n=10): TlOf water protons in the liver of rats was measured with a pulsed NMR spectrometer operating at 20 Mgz. Concentrations of paramagnehic trace elements Cu,Fe,Mn were determined by means of neutron activation analysis. Lowering of the Mn-Concentration in the liver by a chemically induced cirrhosis (thioacetamide,TAA) showed an increase of T 1 , while a small increase of Mn-concentration in the liver (after injection of a hepatobiliary Mn complex) shortens T 1 . Changes in liver Cu had only a minor influence on T I . Representation of T 1 and Mn~oncentration of all animals (controls, Mn injected, TAA treated) in a diagram demonstrated a correlation, which suggests a dependence of liver-T I from Mn-concentration. Stimulation of liver growth and enzyme activity by phenobarbital, however, showed a correlation between Tland Mn concentration which differs from that described above. Because a 30-40 fold change in paramagnetism of Mn by complexing the metal with different ligands can be demonstrated in vitro, it may be assumed, that a different degree of complex formation: of Mn with enzymes in the liver (mainly dehydrogenases of the micosoma] fraction) will also affect T 1 in the liver. A dynamic phantom was constructed in order to evaluate and measure @/qe absorbed dose in the thyroid trap efter pertechnetate thyroid up-takes. This phantom consists of a polyethylene cylinder (thyroidal pool) connected to tworese~oirs of saline and sunk in a \"neck mimicking cylinder\". ImCi Tc-99m was injected into the top reservoir (blood circulation) and a 2-compartment model employed in order to find the rate of change of Tc-99m uptake both in euthyroidal or hyperthyroidal situations ~nd be used with our experimental system. LiP thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) placed on the \"thyroid cylinder\" to measure the \"organ\" dose as well as on the neck phantom to measure the \"skin\" dose in a dynamic procedure mimicking thyroid's pertechnetate uptake. By TLD dosimeters we also measured the skin dose on normal volunteers and hyper thyroidal patients. Comparison of our dynamic phantom and in vivo measurements, with theoretically calculated doses,shows a good approximation. A deviation of values less than 5% for euthyroids and 10% for hyperhytoids was found. Wa ceucluded that we can rely on the values of skin doses measured by TLD to estimate thyroid's dose. TLD skin dose measurements could be easy and reliable method for the dose estimation of many organs.",

Attempts have been made to overcome this effect by channels ratio corrections, decolourisation and USe of \"Cerenkov inserts\". The latter were found to eliminate count rate variations due the presence of pigments and the gradual return of colour. His disadvantage is the low efficien cy~is better only for small volume inserts. This investigation was undertaken to improve the efficiency of Cerenkov ~nserts by the construction of a special vial. This is a Perpex vial (diam : 28mm, hight : ABmm~ wall thickness 2,75mm), filled with 10ml Esculin-Water solution (Ig/l) and hold in 3 externally metalized (A1) polystyrene tubes (capacity 0,5ml each, diam : 6,Smm, wall thickness 0,5mm)positioned at 6,Smm from vial axis. The radioactive solution is pipetted into these inserts. The counting efficiency is improved according to reasons : (1) the use of 3 tubes increase the surface/volume ratio compared to same total capacity (1,Sml) single tube, then reduce the self-absocpbion (2) the metalizBtian is favoutable to reflexion of light against absorption on the opaque surface (~) the Perpex vial create itself a Cerenkov spectrum (4) the Esculin convert the U.V. component of light into a visi ble one better matched to photocathode.

Aerosols of very small particle slze obtained after appropriate nebullzation proved to be highly suitable for inhalation selntigraphy of the lungs. The results of pulmonary ventilation scintlgraphy using Tc-99m aerosol and subsequent perfuslon scintlgraphy are reported, In 29 patients (13 men and 16 women) who were suspected of having pulmonary embolism, a ventilation sclntigraphy was performed in at least 4 views 3 minutes after inhalation of Tc-99m aerosol of human serum albumin microspheres with a partlcle size of 1/urn. Owlng to the comparatively low radioectivi~/ of fhls aerosol, already one hour later a pulmonary perfuslon scinHgraphy in 8 views could follow applying Tc-99m microspheres and a considerably higher radioactivity, Combined ventilation and perfusion sclntigraphy of\" the lungs could be achieved within 2 hours or le~s depending on the required extent of seintlgraphy. A mismatch of scintlgraphle results exhibltlng areas oflntact ventl]aGon and reduced perfusion was observed in 22 patients. However, 7 patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease demonstsated a reduction of both ventilation end pedusion in corresponding areas so that the confirmation of suspected pulmonary embolism was difficult. As a diagnostic supplement, ventilation scintlgraphy with gaseous Xe-t 33 or Xe-127 in one vlew showed radioxenon retention in 5 patients. Aerosol scintigraphy permitted scintigrams to be taken in several views but incompletely presented a delay of accumulation or of loss of radioactivity in pulmonary areas with poor ventilation. In conclusion, ventilation s\u00a2intigraphy uslng Tc-99m aerosol of very small particle slze may be combined with perfusion scintlgrephy of the lungs in order to facilltate early diagnosis and rapid treatment of pulmonary embolism. If lung ventilation studies have not attained the wide spread use owed to its clinical importance in the past, there is one common reason : it is to difficult for routine use. Some months ago the SynteVent aerosol system was introduced to the european market. It consists of a reusable shielding unit and a disposible ventilation kit. The generator delivers a fine aerosol mist of uniform particles, (Tc-99m-DTPA or Tc-99m-Nanocoll) 98% of which have a size under 1 pm. After the examination the used ventilation kit is removed en bloc from the shielding unit and disposed off as contaminated waste. We tested the new system on 150 patients between the age of 35 amd 85. In all cases the ventilation studies were followed by perfusion images. As a rule the ventilation images obtained were of good quality. The system is easy to handle and always ready to use due to the employment of substances that are on hand in any nuclear medicine department. The use of the short lived Tc-g9m as tracer and the disposibility of the kit for the aerosol production offer no radiation problems and allows the application of this ventilation technic even for specialists outside larger nuclear medicine departments. The examination technic requires only a minimum of cooperation from the patient without discomfort to him. Consequently our diagnostic strategy has changed to perform the ventilation scintigraphy before the lung perfusion as soon as the diagnostic problem or the clinical situation requires the knowledge of the specific ventilation study, This hes led to an important improvement in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in our daily clinical routine both in speed and accuracy. . To evaluate a new nebulizer system (Venturi with a particle sizer), 37 patients referred for detection of pulmonary embolism had on the same day a ventilation scan followed by a perfusion study (4 mCi of Tc-99m microspheres). 10 mCi of Tc-99m DTPA was nebulized in a volume of 2 ml (Group A : 15 patients) or a volume of I ml (Group B : 22 patients). The time of nebulization was 345 + 54 see. S.D. for Group A and 336 + 114 see. S.D. for Group E. 4 views including Ant, Post., RP0 and LP0 were recorded (200 K counts) with 33 patients (Group A = ]4, Group B = 19) and 5 views including ant., LA0, RAO, RL and LL with the other patients (Group A I, Group B = 3). The efficiency of the aerosol system defined as the ratio between ~he pulmonary activity due to the aerosol and the initial activity in the nebulizer has been estimated for 27 patients (Group A = ~2, Oroum B = ]5), The quality of the scans was independently evaluated by two of us.",

Using 99mTc-DTPA monodisperded radioaereosol,we studied,using two breathing rates and ventilatio n flows,SO non smoking volunteers with no clinical sign of respiratory disease,A digital static image on posterior view of lungs was collected. We selected two regions of interest in the righ t and left lungs using a semi-automatic method.Region g was composed of the superior lobe;region S was composed of the medium and inferior lobe on the right side,and of the inferior lobe on th e left side.We calculated B/A ratio for both lun g in the two different breathing conditions. All this variables were shown to change altering the ventilation flow and the breathing rate. In all the volunteers variables went down when ventilation flow went up,in the different breath ing conditions.We find a linear relation between B/A ratio and ventilation flow and breathing rate.The knowledge of ventilation flow and breathi ng rate is very important if one is to study co\u00a3 rectly regional ventilation,because different c~ nditions are able to introduce significant change in results.g range of normality for variables calculated with our method is presented,by varia tions induced by different ventilation flow and breathing rate. Scans were performed successively the same day with a scintillation camera (4 incidences : anteriot, posterior, left posterior oblique, right posterior oblique). Nebulization was performed with a \"SEDI II\" apparatus (I.R.E., Belgium). We first studied control subjects with a normal Krypton seintigraphy. Ventilation images are the same with both methods except an increased uptake in postero-inferior regions with the aerosol. We then studied patients with an abnormal Krypton scan : patients with bronchoemphysema, neoplasms, fibrosis, sarcoidosis. In case of broncho-emphysema, we noted a discrepancy between images which is proportional to the respiratory functional alteration.

The volume weighted distribution of the washout constants also allows the estimation of the volume affected with decreased ventilation through area determination from the distribution. Factor analysis of dynamic structures (FADS) allows to extract the few main components in a set of dynamic data. It associates an activity time curve (factor) with the spatial distribution of the corresponding events (factorial image). We applied FADS to scintigraphic studies of lung ventilation using Kr-glm in 5 normal subjects and 2 patients (COPD and lung cancer). Looking for 3 components, we studied the influence of both lateral decubitus (LD) with respect to dorsal decuhitus (DD) on these components. If the dynamic curve representing each factor received only few variations in normals, their corresponding image was altered. The ist factor associated with a strong ventilation located at both bases in normals in DD posture, almost disappeared in the non-dependent base while the dependent base was reinforced. To a lesser extent, the same type of asymmetry occurred in the 2nd ventilation factor, showing the entire intrathoracic region. The 3rd factor, showing the delivery of the tracer bolus in the large airways and in the lungs, was Rot significantly modified by posture. For patients in DD, the Is% factor involves the whole lungs, as well as the bases. In LD, the asymmetry between the dependent and non-dependent lung is considerably decreased with respect to normals, indicating a decrease of the proportion of ventilation in the dependent lung. The 2nd factor does not show significant redistribution of ventilation in one case and a phase shift of the ventilation between DD and LD in the other study. Interpretation of third factor changes remains difficult since a better understanding of patient data implies the need for a 4th factor. Thus, FADS appears to be a promising tool for the physiological interpretation of the distribution of ventilation, particularly to explain the effect of posture changes. Recent studies have demonstrated that 99mTc-Glucoheptonate (Tc-GN) accumulates in primary lung cancer. This study was undertaken to compare the diagnostic usefulness of Te-GH and Gallium-67 (Ga 67) thoracic scintigraphies in detecting hilar and mediastinal spread of lung carcinoma. We prospectively studied 36 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer. The primary neoplasms were visible on chest radiographs and were histologically proven (22 squamous-cell, 9 adenocarcinoma, 4 large-cell and 1 small-cell carcinoma). Within a one week period, all patients were evaluated sequentially with Te-GH followed by Ga-67 scan, mediastinoscopy,and, if indicated, thoracotomy. Anterior, posterior and if necessary, oblique thoracic scans were performed using a large-field-of-view camera 6-9 hours after i.v. injection of 25 mCi of Tc-GH. Immediately after the Tc-GE scan, patients received 6-9 mCi of Ga-67 and images were obtained 48-72 hours later. All primary lung tumors were detected by Ga-67 scans while 32 tumors (89%) accumulated Tc-GH. Using an intensity grading system for tumor uptake of both ragiotracers, Ga-67 showed a better accumulation and higher tumor-to-background ratio in 47% of cases. Fifteen patients had a positive mediastinoscopy: mediastinal spread was detected by Tc-GN in 9 patients (60%) and by Ga-67 in 13 patients (87%). Of the 5 patients having hilar involvement confirmed at thoraeotomy, 4 were visualized by Tc-GH and all 5 were diagnosed by Ga-67. Although the number of cases is limited, these results suggest that Ga-67 is more accurate than Tc-GH for the detection of intrathoracic metastatic spread of primary lung carcinoma. Because of its low sensitivity (60%) Tc-GH cannot he recommended for the clinical staging of primary lung cancer. Previous reports on the role of multiorgan scan -liver scan (LS), tone scan (US), and brain scan-for the detection of lung cancer meta L tases have sh~n no agreement on its value. A retrospective study of lag patients with proved lun~ cancer has been carried out. According to hystology they were classified as: 29 adenocarcinema, 47 squamous, 43 small cell, and 3 large cell. Each patient had the three scans done with a I,FOV camera and the results were compared with the clinical and biochemical data for each organ.",

All patients underwent also electrocardiographic, echographic and scintigraphic ( 2OITL or 99mTc PP ) investigations as well. Analyzable amplitude images could not be obtained in one case at right and in two at left but with regard to phase images, in 4 at right and in 23 at left. In all cases but four ( 2aneurysms and 2 akdnesias ) out of 45, phase and amplitude images obtained from FP and MUGA studies performed successively were superposable and gave the s~me informations. In the 22 cases of FP alone, phase and amplitude a~nc~n~alities correlated well with other data. Tn two cases, multigated sudies were not contributive owing to arrhytmia but first pass well. Comparison between images obtained at the time of Pyrophosphate scan FP and images from the combined FP-MUGA performed in the same patients (~I) one to two weeks later showed the technique to be reproducible.

The RY was performed at rest in the LA0 40 \u00b0 projection and the average time between the RVand CA was 7.5 days. The phase and amplitude images were graded as normal, and mild, moderate and severe abnormalities. The areas of the left ventricle studied were: The anterior septum, the anterior, the lateral~ the posterior and the inferior wall. The max sensitivity for the phase image was 77.8% for severe angiographie abnormalities of the anterior wall and the rain was 20.0% for abnormalities in the lateral wall. For amplitude the max was 71.~% for moderate abnormalities in the ant. septum and the min was 0.0% in the inferior wall. For phase and/or amplitude the max was 81.2% in the anterior and the min was 33-3% in the lateral wall_ The specificity ranged from 100% in the lateral wall to 72.2~ in the posterior wall.

The current methods of thrombus imaging are less than ideal and essentially limited to the extremities. We have investigated the possibility of imaging thrombi located in the trunk by using an antiplatelet monoclonal (7E3) antibody labeled with 1-123 (chloramine-T method) or In-Ill (antibody -DTPA conjugate). The specific activity of the 1-123 and In-lll preparations was 20-300 pCi/pg and 10-30 ~Ci/Bg, respectively. The antibody is an Egg i that binds to the glycoprotein 2B-3A complex on human platelets and blocks ADP-indueed aggregation of both human and dog platelets by inhibiting the binding of fibrinogen to the platelet surface. When radiolabeled 7E3 antibody was incubated with whole blood (0.13 pg/ml) and the mixture then clotted with thromhin (I U/ml) 68% of the radioactivity remained with the clot despite repeated washing. Initially, uptake was high in the dog liver with subsequent accumulation in the spleen. Blood activity persisted for up to 24 hr. Venous or arterial injury sites were consistently localized but intravenously formed thromhi (isolated vein segment injected with thrombln and formed clot released) was not always reproducible probably due to their low platelet content. However, arterial thrombi produced by placement of a copper wire into s lobar pulmonary artery were easily detected whe~ platelets were labeled exvdvo by incubation of whole blood with radiolabeled antibody (without washing) before relnjecting. No blood pool subtraction was necessary for this procedure. We conclude that radiolabeled antiplateiet monoclonal antibodies should be investigated in humans for iocallzlng arterial thromhl in the pulmonary and coronary elrnulation, intra-cardiac thrombi and sites of suspected vascular damage with clot formation.",

Counts are made at 10-15 points on the legs with the lower extremities elevated 45 degrees. An increase in radioactivity is considered to be suggestive of DVr and is expressed in Q units. Criterion of a positive test is at least three points adjacent on the suspected leg with an increase in uptake (>13 or .<-3) , or one poinh with more than 13 or less than -13. We use the probe method as an initial screeningtest for DVT in otrc hospital. In 25 patients with clinical suspected DVT and with a positive probe test we performed consecutively a test using a garsna car~era (LVOF~ siemens). 300-400 k-counts views of ankles, cal yes, ~neeregions (posterior) and thighs/pelvis (~/]terior) were made with the legs elevated between 10 and 30 min. after a second injection of 370 MBq Tc99m plasmin. Dynamical data obtained with a Ganlna 11 system were processed and the Q-expressions were calculated from I 0-15 symmetrical ROI's delineated on the deep vessels of the legs. Gaalr~ camera test was positive in 24 of 25 patients. Most frawes showed hot spot with or without veinocclusion and were interpreted as ccapatible with DVT. Some studies with c~ly diffuse uptake were considered as low probable U~T. Specificity and sensitivity of this sciztigraphical imaging interpretation using X-ray phlebography as a reference method has yet to be determined. Here we have a prospective study in progress. We conclude that Tc99m plasmin test with garm~ camera and computer processing is a easy,rapid and sensitive test for D~T probable due, among other factors, to a real thrombous uptake of plasmin.

The most striking alterations in hepatic IHA kinetics were observed in alcoholic liver cirrhosis: a decreased uptake and elimination rate in the liver, whereas myocardial elimination was not significantly different from the control group. In contrast, postnecrotic liver cirrhosis only caused a less importantly delayed hepatic elimination of IHA. Diabetes was characterised by alterations in hepatic as well as in myocardial IHA kinetics. These changes in IHA kinetics, even without correction for free iodine, clearly reflect the effect of alcohol on liver metabolism and the effect of an increased pool of unesterified fatty acids in diabetic patients.

This examination offers excellent visualization of the biliary system and supplies functional information as to the patency of the cystic duct. We have studied 116 consecutive patients with abdominal complaints suggestive of acute cholecystitis. Scintigraphic examinations were performed for: 2~ hours following the intravenous administration of 4-5 mci of the agent (HIDA or DIPA). Our results showed that in 46 of these patients, the gall bladder was not visualized by scintigraphy. Of this group of patients, 41 were found to have acute cholecystitis at the time of surgery. Normal IDA scans were observed in the remaining 70 patients, none of whom were subsequently judged to have had acute cholecystitis. According to our results, comparing the scanning results with operative diagnoses, the sensitivity of the IDA scan was near 100%, in that no proven case of acute cholecystitis had visualization of the gall bladder. The specificity was found to be about 90%. In the remaining cases of 5 false-positve IDA scans, 4 patients had chronic cholecystitis, and one pancreatitis. Thus, visualization of the gall bladder by IDA scanning virtually rules out the possibility of acute cholecystitis.

The stochastic approach reduces to a ~CWM/~ in the case of constant infusion with negligible decay, and only in such situation is the approximatlon of good mixing really valid. This approximation cannot be extended to wash-out and short-lived isotopes studies in general because in such situations the definition of volume of distribution and/or partition coefficient are not strictly appropriate, Assumption of good mixing is equivalent to the assumption that the impulse response function of the considered system is monoexponential (as in Kety-Schmit equation). That cannot be generally true since shape of impulse response function is dictated by the expectation of the existence of a minimum tmin, a most probable t D and maximum transit time. Hence, the ~onoexponential behaviour of impulse response function should be seen as an approximation, albeit a good one when tmi n ~tD~--O. Under the circumstances which a~e defined by the physiological properties of the system, it may be expected that SOWMM is a good approximation and that constant volume of dist= ribution of tracer may indeed be defined. The question of whether, in a particular application, an isotope may be regarded as \"long-\" or \"short-lived\" depends not only on its life-time, but also on transfer properties of the considered system. The stochastic approach takes into account the transfer properties of the considered system and the distribution of tracer in the system not requiring a hypothesis of good mixing and providing a possibility of evaluating corrections for decay.

However, the T\u00bd values measured after i.v. injected 1-123-HDA will be influenced by a high background activity. Therefore, we compared the elimination rates from different myocardial regions after intracoronary injection of 1-123-IDA. Six patients (pts) with coronary artery disease (CAD) were studied during coronary angiography. The presence of significant lesions in the left anterior descending branch (LAD) and circumflex artery {CX) was noted. After injection of 0.1 mCi I~123-HDA in the left coronary artery, scintigraphy was performed during 30 min in LAG 40 position and T\u00bd values of the regions perfused by the LAD and CX were calculated. Results:(meandSD) T\u00bd values of the 6 LAD regions were: 22.3\u00b14.5 min. T\u00bd values of the 6 CX regions 24.0\u00b13.0 min.

For each of those methods and for different types of defects, registration is performed between the original normal thallium image simulation. The results are expressed as the mean error, expressed in interpixel distance units. Results show that the four methods are almost equivalent when the defects are small in size and intensity, albeit the method of profile cross correlation is less efficent.

Vanrijckeghem. 1231-Hippuran is used for the noninvasive assessement of kidney functions. The use of the more patient friendly but more expensive 1231 requires a high labeling yield.Earlier described methods were tried, hut resulted in the formation of 0-]231-benzoic acid and 12312. This paper describes a labeling method making use of a Cu(I) catalyst. An almost quantitative labeling yield is obtained within 5 minutes. The amount of O-]23I-genzoie acid formed is negligible and the generation of }2312 is avoided. The Cu(I) catalyst in presence of Sn(lI) also allows that only 1 mg can be used in this reaction resulting in a high specific activity. The radiopharmaeeutieal is purified by a fast reversed phase EPLC separation with a Me0N/ HIO/RAC mixture as eluent.

THE FRACTION OF IM~NOREACTIVE ANTIBODY DETERMINED AT INFINITE ANTIGEN EXCESS T. Lindmo, E. Eoven, F. Cuttitta, J. Fedorko and P.A. Bunn Jr.Because radiolabelling may adversely alter the antibody, quality control procedures must be applied to determine important characteristics of the radiolabelled antibody. Based on theoretical considerations, we have developed a radiobinding assay in which the fraction of immunoreactive antibody is determined by linear extrapolation to conditions representing infinite antigen excess.If only a fraction r of the radiolabelled antibody is immunoreactive, the mass equation can be used to show that [T]/[B] = 1/r + i/rKa[F], where [T] is the total concentration of antibody and [B] that of cell-bound antibody in a binding assay set upwith a dilution series of cell concentrations.K a is the association constant, and [F] is the concentration of free binding sites~ which is approximately proportional to the cell concentration under conditions of antigen excess. A double-inverse plot of [T]/[B] as a function of I/[F] will yield a straight line. The origin represents infinite antigen excess, and the corresponding value of [T]/[B]is i/r. Thus, by plotting the data according to the above equation, and extrapolating a fitted straight line to its intercept with the ordinate, the fraction of immunoreactive antibody is determined as the inverse of the intercept value. We established the method using 125I and lllln labelling of monocl0nal antlhodies. Normally, immunoreactive fractions about 0.9 were found, but a prolonged ehloramine-T reaction for 125I labelling resulted in an immunoreactive fraction of only 0.6.

The carbohydrat antigen is a glycolipid secreted by tumor cells. Its serum concentration is evaluated by immunoradiometric assay using a monoclonal antibody called 1116 NS 19-9. This work relates the diagnostic and pronostic facilities of CA 19-9 assay in various types of cancer. Assays have been performed using ORZS-kit and referring to an international standard. Normal values are estimated within 0-25 U/ml (n = 250). We only report about tumors for which CA 19-9 assay presented an interest compared to CEA and AFP. Tumors of the digestive tract :(i) Pani[~aEideni~ai~in39_a (n = 15) : very high values have been found mostly appearing (80 %)when only 60 % of CEAand 26 % of AFP rates were found abnormals, the CA 19-9 blood concentration increase being related to the extension, local or not, of the tumor. (ii) ~l~rectal adenocarcinoma without metastases (n = 15): ............................................... 54 % of CA 19-9 rates are high as well as 60 % of CEA ones whereas 7 % of AFP values are pathological. (iii) Colorectal carcinoma with local recurrences values are high whereas only 64 % of CA 19-9 rates are abnormals. Gynaecological tumors :(i) O[ar~an t_um_ors :They are the best indication for CA 19-9 assay. If no metastase have been encountered (n = 75), 80 % of CA 19-9 values are high whereas only 31% of CEA results are abnormals. In liver metastases cases (n = 20), these positive rates respectively increase up to 85 % for CAl9-9 and 50 % for CEA. With non hepatic metastases (n = iO), frequencies of pathological values are 7O % for CA 19-9 and 40 % for CEA. When regrouping these three classes, AFP is subnormal in 60 % of the cases. (iii) u~E~t_u/nsEs_(3_Zj53 : CA 19-9 and CEA rates both are pathological with a frequency of 53 %.CA19-9 turns positive prior to CEAor to the first clinical symptoms apparition. Radioimmunometric CA 19-9 assay displays a better diagnostic power than CEA and AFP in pancreatic cancers and ovarian tumors. For the follow-up of colorectal adenocarcinoma extension, CA 19-9 and CEA are complementary to each other. In fact high CA I9-9 rates are not systematically related to high CEA rates especially without metastases. In most cases, CA19-9 increase preceeds that of CEA.

This Low uptake might be due to therapeutic interference, though no precise correlation could be found up to now. IAMP Spect appears to be a powerfull tool for detecting lesional territories of epileptic loci in fnterictaI phases. A very good correlation between S.E.E.G. and IAMP localisation is found.

A model of the left ventricu]ar myocardium was used to simulate myocardial scintigraphy with Thallium 201 -C1 in p]anar and SPECT techniques. The device consists of nine segments representing the )eft ventricular wall and a cap representing the apex, all to be fil]ed with activity. Planar images were recorded from three views, tomograms perpendicular to the midventricular longitudinal axis were obtained after transversal and sag~tal reconstruction of the SPECT study according to our clinical routine investigations, in both techniques examinations were performed by varying the spatial position of the phantom and varying the size and location of a predeflned defect. The examinations are compared in respect of the following problems: I. detection of the smallest possib]e cold spot, 2. topographic indentification of a cold spot in regard to the true location of the experimental defect. The results of the study are correlated with the findings obtained by our clinical investigations in axial SPECT of the myocardium which include quantitative evaluation of the tomograms.St.Clemens -Hospital Geldern, Abt.Radiologie und Nuklearmed[zin, D-4170 Geldern,F.R.Germany and Abt.

COMPARISON OF VARIOUS FILTERS iN SPECT ON REAL PATIENT DATA. g.Kne~aurek,~.Spaventi and l.SlausTwo classic techniques oF reconstructing an ~mage from its projections are iterative matrix inversion (IMI) and Filtered backprojectfon (FBP) technique, The latter is Faster since it does not require iteration but it has a disadvantage because corrections For attenuation can only be approximated, Also, the FBP technique can be implemented on smaller computer systems while IMI technique requires larger ones. This is the reason that FBP technique is mostly used in clinical routines. In applying FBP technique it is necessary to convolve projections by an appropriate filter. From the theory it follows that the filter should be ramp function in frequency space with cutoff frequency equal to the highest sampling i.e. Nyquist frequency. Though this Ramp filter gives the best resolution in the reconstructed image it amplifies noise for data with statistical fluctuations and sharp cutoff gives oscillations in regions of sharp contrast. To suppress this ripple artifact this Ramp filter has been multiplied, in frequency space, by various windows(HanD, Hamming, Parzen, Butterworth)  or some other filters have been used (Shepp-Logan, modified Shepp-Logan). ]n comparison with Ramp filter all these filters have poorer resolution but the reconstructed image has smoother texture. We have applied and compared all mentioned filters on real patient data and even more, we have constructed our own Karin filter which, as Butterworth filter, can be modified to suit the user. Our prelimlnary results indicate that in many cases it is useful to use filters with narrow central lobe, i.e. \"sharp\" filters and then, if necessary, to apply smoothing or other methods of image enhancement.Nuclear Medicine a Ontology Clinic, \"Dr. M1aden Stojanovid\" Clinical Hospital, Vinogradska 29, 41000 Zagreb, Yugoslavia A511 A SIMPLE METHOD FOR STEREOSCOPIC IMAGING IN NUCLEAR MEDICINE S.

The data acquisition was carried out from 3 different directions /LA0-15, LA0-30, IA0-45/ by a Hungarian computer system in each investigation. The secuence of contraction of the ventricle walls was analysed by the help of the phase display method by two undepending observers. The ventricular preexcitation could be identified unambigu/ously in ll cases of 12 patients with WPW syndrome on the basis of the ventricle, corresponding to the 12 lead ECG findings. In one case the accessory pathway near the septum could not be identified /sensitivity: 92 %/ An early ventriculary contraction was diagnosticated falsely in 3 of the 12 patients with LGL syndrome on the basis of phase display method /specificity: 75 9~/. The reproducibility of the used method was verified by repeated investigations. The use of several directions of data acquisition proved to be usefull especially in cases of accessory pathways near to the septum or on the posterior part of the basis of the left ventricle. The authors in order to prove their preliminary results used the body surface mapping method which according to literary data is also suitable to localise preexcitation in non invasive way. They draw in their report their conclusions on the basis of experience received from an essentially increased case-number. LV function during exercise has been evaluated in 2 patients with LBBB and 6 patients with programmable RDF (RDP 2, alpha, ESln, FRG) implanted for complete AV block, bradyarrhythmia or sick sinus syndrome. Equilibrium RNVG was carried out at rest as well as during exercise (multistage, graded tread mill ECG test) and global (GEF) and sectorial ejection fraction (SEF) were measured. Regional asynchronia was quantified by Fourier's analysis and determination of sectorial phase shift. With increasing heart rate (~) during exercise, %he LBBB patients presented increasing 8PH and decreasing SEF in the posterolateral (PL) region of the LV wall. This prevented an increase in GEF in I patient and even caused a gradual decrease in GEF in the other patient. Maximum cardiac output (CO) occurred with sub-maximum HR of 115 %o 150 bpm. HR dependant increase of SPH and decrease of the PL wall was also found in 6 patients with RDP. In ejection fraction. The present paper reports the {esults of first pass-RNV in 24 patients with LBBB and compares the regional wall motion analysis with the findings of 2D-echocardiography. The radionuclide ventriculograms were obtained using a multicrystal gamma camera with high count rate capability (Baird Atomic System 77). 99m-Tc-pertechnetate or -more recently -195m-Au was used for bolus injection. 10 patients had a supine rest study only, in 14 an additional exercise investigation was performed. The use of phase analysis,amplitud image,eje~ tion wave and phase histogram obtained by Fourier analysis have allowed to get physiological information concerning to the sequence of ventricular emptied and its modifications due to disturbances of electrical conduction.Material & Method: It has been studied 35 patients,7 with RBBB and 28 with LBBB. 8 normal subjects were used as control group. At a first step The F.analysis was appliedon the total image,beeing the phase histogram very often not demonstrative of the differences between LV & RV emptying. By this reasons a second step was carried out,in which F.analysis was obtained from ROI in each ventricle,showing an indepen~ dent phase histogram. Overlapping both of them was easier to figure out the differences between both ventricular emptying.Results: In the control group the phase histogram showed a difference of less tha 5 \u00b0 in 6 cases. In the two remaining ones the differences obtained were 8 \u00b0 & 10 \u00b0 respectively. In 4 normal subjects the nadir was in the same frame in 3 was delayed one frame in LV and in one was ~alayed one frame in RV.LBBB: from 28 patients studied,18 (64%) showed differences > 20\u00b0;S were in the range 15\u00b0-20 \u00b0 and 2 in the range 10-15 \u00b0.RBBB: The differences betweeh both apex histograms (LV&RV) were less significatives. In 5 cases the range was 15\u00b0-20 \u00b0 and in 2 was I0\u00b0-15 \u00b0 . ( In all these patients the ventricular activation was delayed in RV ).Conclusions: The ejection wave and phase ima ge obtained by F.analysis from total image ares less demonstrative than those obtained separately from each ventricle mainly if we use ~2 frames instead of 16. Previous investigations have shown that age 250 yrs., thyroid weight >50 g, thyroid nodules and a non-homogeneous thyroid scan are simple but not specific indicators of autonomy in pts. with euthyroid iodine-deficient goitre, who show a subnormal TRH test. Together with the existence of endocrine ophthalmopathy and increased titers of microsomal antibodies these symptoms were used in a cumulative way for a trial to separate 326 hyperthyroid pts. without autonomous adenoma into those possibly having non-immunogenic (NIM-HY) and into those possibly having immunogenic (IM-HY) hyperthyroidism.In order to prove that this way of separation has a sufficient probability of beeing correct Thyrotrophin displacing activity (TDA) was determined in 120 hyperthyroid pts. separated independently by the symptoms mentioned above. The incidence of TDA in 57 pts. classified as possibly having IM-HY was 79 % and in 63 pts. classified as possibly having NIM-HY was 3 %. The low incidence of TDA in NIM-HY was in the same range as in 237 pts. with euthyroid goitre and euthyroid or hyperthyroid autonomous adenoma. It is now well ack~itted that TSI are involved in the pathogenesis of Graves'disease. The aim of this work was to establish an assay of TSI helpful in the clinical diagnosis and follow-up of hyperthyroid patients. The method was developed starting frc~a the method described by Kleinman et al. (J.Lab.Clin.Med., 1980, 95:581) using h~nan thyroid m6s~ranes.Thyroid adenylate cyclase-stimulating activity was detelqnined by the generation of cyclic (32p) AMP after incubation of thyroid m~mbranes, immunoglobulins (IG) and (32p)ATP. IG were purified by ammonil~n sulfate precipitation followed by desalting by chrc~atography on Sephsdex G-50 gel. The results were expressed as percent of basal activity (100%). In 26 assays using 4 different ma~branes preparations, the average basal activity (BA) was 183 pmoles cAMP/rag prot. generated in 15 sin (CV 8.8%). The response to NaF (20 raM) stimulation averaged 743% of the BA (CV 9%). The validity of the test was further ascertained by testing TSI positive IG which yielded a response of 175% (CV 7.6%) versus ~ormal IG (105%, CV 6.7%). Clinical evaluation was perfoxed in 92 patients referred to the thyroid clinic : 32 patients were found to be negative, 60 positive. All 32 TSI (-) patients did not present any symptc~ of hyperthyroidism. Among the 60 TSI (+) patients, 28 were clinically euthyroid and 32 hyperthyroid. The followup of the euthyroid TSI(+) patients revealed a relapse in 3 cases. The clinical interest of this assay was confixraed by the finding that 12 out of 13 newly diagnosed Graves patients were TSI(+) . In addition, in 23 patients presenting with ophtalroopathy, 19 (83%) were TSI (+) : 12 of these patients were euthyroid and 7 hyperthyroid. These results are in agreesent with recently published data. In conclusion, the proposed method is adequate for evaluation management of patients with Graves' disease and as such useful for routine analysis. Depart6~ent of Nuclear Medicine,University of Louvain Medical School, Brussels, Belgium. Thyroid routine in vitro diagnostic procedures are developing continuously in direction of higher diagnostic sensitivity/specificity and also simplicity. The latest developments are: FT4, FT3, hTg antibodies (AM), TSM receptor AB and sensitive one-day TSH by radioligand assay (RLA) as well as by enzymeligand assay (ELA). During the past fou~years we presented a series of data especially underscoring the very high laboratory performance and high clinical value of FT4 and FT3 and the very high clinical value of hTg. Up to recently FT4 and FT3 were offered alternatively to the T4/TBG and T3/TBG ratio. hTg by RIA has already substituted 2 -3 years ago for the routine whole-body scan with 1-13i in otherwise complete follow-up of differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Furthermore, recent evaluation of two new sensitive one-day TEE LA (IRMA and ELISA) on monoclonal antibody basis revealed an especially high laboratory and clinical performance of the IRMA with good separation of eu-from hyperthyroidism by basal TEE. Based upon our experience as well as upon the literature we recently changed our routine diagnostic program as offered to the in-and outpatient clinics of our ~iversity accordingly as presented below: Recently, there have been promising reports on the value of T1-2O~ scintigraphy for the evaluation of benign and/or malignant thyroid nodules (R. 0CHI, etal., C~TCER 50:236-240, 1982) showing a 95% sensitivity and a 90% specifity. It was the purpose of this prospective study to test the usefulness of T1-201 thyroid scanning for decision making in patients presenting with cold nodules. 26 consecutive patients with scintigraphically cold nodules underwent quantitative thyroid scanning immediately after i.v. injection of 2.0 mCi TI-201 8nd 3-4 hrs later. ~\\l patients subsequently underwent surgery for extirpation of the nodule or thyroidectomy, respectively, so that in all cases the final diagnosis was proven histologically. According to the score given by 0CHI increased uptake in the cold nodules relative to normal thyroid tissue on both the early and the delayed scan was considered malignant (positive), whereas similar or decreased uptake was interpreted as benign (negative). Five of the 26 patients had malignant nodules. However, only 3 of these revealed positive scans (60%), whereas 2 were false negative. Out of the 21 patients with benign nodules 17 had a true negative scan, while h demonstrated a malignant pattern (false positive). In conclusion, the results of this prospective study do not confirm the previous optimistic reports on the usefulness of thyroid T1-201 scintignaphy for the diagnostic evaluation of cold nodules, ~;hieh is in our experience only of limited diagnostic value, with a sensitivity of 60% and a specificity of 80%. Following injections of 99mTc Rhenium Sulphur Colloid into the second interdigital space of 55 limbs, images of the ilio-lnguinal lymph nodes were obtained at 38 mins., I, 2 and 3 hours using a gamma camera. 34 limbs (26 patients) had the clinical and radiological features of primary lympheedema, 10 limbs (8 patients) had venous oedema, and 12 limbs (6 volunteers) were normal.The ilio-inguinal lymph nodes were visuallsed at 30 minutes in all 12 control limbs and in the 10 limbs with venous disease, but in only one of the 34 lymphoedematous limbs.The amount of activity present in each ilio-inginal lymph node chain at 30 minutes, estimated as a percentage of the injected activity was significantly lower in the 34 iymphoedematous limbs (0.042% ~ 0.072) than in the 12 control limbs (1.4% ~ 0.7)*.The 10 limbs mi~h venous disease had a significantly higher intake (2.3% ; 0.84)** than the control limbs.The percentage uptake of the colloid in the ilio-inguinal lymph nodes at I, 2 and 3 hours increased with time in both the venous and control limbs while comparison of the control and venous limbs showed that the venous limbs maintained a statistically higher uptake in the lymph nodes at I, 2 and 3 hours.The 34 lymphoedematous limbs showed a persistently low uptake of the colloid throughout the study.On visual interpretation the sensitivity of this technique in diagnosing lymphoedema was 97% and its specificity 100%. Estimation of the percentage uptake of the colloid has demonstrated the slow lymph clearance associated with lympboedema and the increased lymphatic flow that may be associated with venous oedema.The technique differentiates between normal limbs, lymphoedema and venous oedema and can be used as a simple diagnostic outpatient technique in the investigations of chronic limb oedema. In order to assess the clinics] usefuln ass Of quantitative lymphoscintigraphy in pts with limb oedema,the Ketterings' method(1981) was employed with slight mo difications related to the different tr acer(rgmTc-S mierocoll)and device(LFOV camera)used. About imCi in.lml(Lymphoscint Solco)were injected in the ist and 3rd interdigital space bilaterally;45ptswere studied:41 with oedema of different aethiology and 4controls(g).ROIs were selected includi ng the injection site(IS),regional nodes (RN)and the limb region between IS and RN(Transit Activity,TA)respectively. Semiquantitative data were expressed as % of the IS activity measured at T~,TA was normalized to i0 sq cm area. Results:the wash out rate at D h was>20% in 6/8C and<20% in 19/20 limbs with lymp hoedema(L)(p <.Ol).The mean T6 value(t/h) was g 2% in 18/20 L(pd. Ol) We have now used 123Y BSP as a specific hepatocyte la~el to see if this discriminates better between types and severity of liver disorders.Twenty five patients with histologically proven liver disease had 1231 BSP and 99TO sulphur colloid tomography performed on separate days using an IGE 400T camera interfaced to a PDP 11/34 Digital computer.SPET Software produced 3-dimensional reconstruction of images. Total 123[ BSP and 99Tc sulphur colloid uptake values and liver volume were then derived. Patients with severe liver disease had percentage uptakes of: 38.9(~ 8.8) and 20.7( ! 5) for 1231 ESP and 99TO sulphur colloid respectively.Those with moderate disease: 62.8(~ 6.5) and 42(~ 6) and those with minimal dysfunction 76.5(2 12) and 61.6 (~ 14). These values correlate well with the clinical and histological findings.The study demonstrates the feasability of 1231ESP tomography in the assessment of liver disease.The use of both isotopes provides a means of measuring both hepatocyte and Kupffer cell function as well as structure. Portosysfemic shunt is one of the most important complications of Liver cirrhosis. UnfortunateLy, current methods for detecting and quantifying this shunt are either non-specific or associated with significant morbidity. The aim of this work was fo evaluate the cLini-caL value of a new non-traumatic method which consisted of administrating TL-201 per rectum and to monitor the absorbed activity using a camera and a computer system. The method assumes that in the absence of portosystemic shunt, most of the absorbed activity wiLL be fixed in the Liver while in the presence of this shunt,some of the activity wiLL be fixed in the myocardium. The ratio of heart to Liver activity can therefore be used to evaluate the importance of the porfosystemic shunt. 34 subjects have been studied. The ratio of heart to liver activity at the g5th minute after the tracer administration is higher in patients with Liver cirrhosis (n=22, m= .9, s.d.-.37) than in patients with steatosis. (n-t0, m= .28, s.d.= .05). In two healthy subjects investigated the H/L ratio was .27 and .30. The reproducibiLity of the test was evaLuated in 8 subjects and showed a good reproducibility. (mean of difference = .03, range = .01 fo .07). Patients with esophageal varices had always a high H/L ratio white some patients with Liver cirrhosis without esophageal varices had also high H/L ratio due probably to the presence of infrahepatic shunt. In conclusion, our results showed the value of this new non-traumatic test for detecting and quantifying extra-as weLL as intrahepafic portosystemic shunt. Ill-In-labelled autologous l~latelets were applied for scintigraphic localization of the source of gastrointestinal bleeding. 29 investigations were performed in 25 patients. In 19 studies showing scintigraphic signs of bleeding, the clinical presentation included occult bleeding in 7, melaena in 7, and bloody stools in 5. The time interval between the injection of lll-In-platelets and visualization of bleeding rangad from i0 rain to 142 h, being longest in cases of occult bleeding. In most cases, the scintigrapbic findings were supported by other diagnostic modalities. In l0 studies, without signs of bleeding, a probable source of bleeding was identified in one patient. Difficulties in reaching firm conclusions on delayed scintigran%s because of accelerated transit of the intestinal contents were encountered in a few cases. To circumvent this problem, we introduced a combined scintigraphic approach by adding a sequential 99m-Tc sulfur colloid study at the time an abnormality on the lll-In-platelet scintigram was first noticed. Using this approach, we could pin-point the source of bleeding in the 5 studies carried out. Our findings indicate that the lll-In-platelet method is sensitive, a fact probably related to the low level of background activity, to the incorporation of labelled platelets in the clot formed at the site of bleeding, and to the possibility of repeated imaging for up to one week after the tracer injection. It may prove of special usefulness in cases of OCCUlt or recurrent bleeding.",
