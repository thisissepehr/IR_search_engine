            "text": "Acute lung injury (ALI) frequently occurs after liver transplantation and major liver surgery. Proinflammatory mediators released by damaged liver after liver ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury might contribute to this form of ALI, but the underlying mechanisms have not been well characterized. High-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1), a recently identified proinflammatory cytokine, was found to be significantly higher in the serum after liver I/R injury. This study investigated whether HMGB1 was involved as a stimulating factor, and whether its downstream Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK), and activator protein-1 (AP-1) signaling pathways act as mediators in the development of liver I/R injury-induced ALI. Extensive ALI and lung inflammation was induced in a rat model of liver I/R injury. Serum HMGB1 was significantly higher after liver I/R injury, and more importantly, expression of HMGB1 mRNA and protein in the lung tissue was also significantly increased. We further found that liver I/R injury enhanced the expression of TLR4 mRNA and protein, and the activity of p38MAPK and AP-1 in the lung tissue. Inhibition of TLR4 expression in the lung tissue by infection with pGCSIL-GFP-lentivirus-expressing small hairpin RNAs targeting the TLR4 gene (TLR4-shRNA lentivirus) significantly attenuated ALI, lung inflammation, and activity of p38MAPK and AP-1 in the lung tissue. These findings indicate that HMGB1 might contribute to the underlying mechanism for liver I/R injuryinduced ALI and that its downstream TLR4, p38MAPK, and AP-1 signaling pathways are potentially important mediators in the development of ALI.",

            "text": "Acute lung injury (ALI) and its more severe form, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), are common complications of liver transplantation and major liver surgery, and thereby significantly contributed to perioperative morbidity and mortality. 1, 2 Liver I/R injury may account for this form of ALI, but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Since the lungs are the first capillary bed that is reached by the blood after leaving the hepatic circulation, one proposed mechanism is that ALI may be induced by proinflammatory mediators released from the injured liver into system circulation. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] High-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1), originally identified as a DNA-binding protein, is a proximal trigger that is sufficient to induce the release of other cytokines classically associated with mediating inflammatory responses, including tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin-1b (IL-1b), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). 8 Interestingly, HMGB1 was rapidly mobilized and released into system circulation by hepatocytes in the setting of liver I/R injury. 8, 9 HMGB1 has also been reported to participate in ALI and lung inflammatory response induced by endotoxin, ventilator, and hemorrhage. [10] [11] [12] For example, HMGB1 expression in the lung was found to be increased within 4 h of hemorrhage, and then remained elevated for more than 72 h after blood loss. Blockade of HMGB1 by the administration of neutralizing antibodies prevented hemorrhage-induced increases in pulmonary levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including keratinocyte-derived chemokine, IL-6, and IL-1b. 11 However, whether HMGB1 participated in liver I/R injuryinduced ALI is still unclear.",

            "text": "Extracellular HMGB1 functions as a damage-associated molecular pattern molecule and activates proinflammatory signaling pathways by activating pattern recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) 13, 14 . While RAGE has only a minor role in macrophage activation by HMGB1, the triggering of the TLR4 signaling pathway by HMGB1 leads to the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) through the accessory protein MyD88, which subsequently activates activator protein-1 (AP-1), and thus regulates inflammatory cytokine expression. 15, 16 Excessive cytokine-mediated inflammation has a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of ALI. 17, 18 In addition, TLR4 is widely distributed in alveolar and bronchial epithelial and vascular endothelial cells in the lung. [19] [20] [21] We have previously demonstrated that the activation of TLR4 and its downstream intracellular signal-transduction pathways is crucial to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. [22] [23] [24] Other studies also reported that TLR4 mutant (C3H/HeJ) mice developed less ALI after unresuscitated hemorrhagic shock or being challenged with LPS. 25, 26 Conversely, the overexpression of TLR4 in transgenic mice aggravated ALI and pulmonary inflammation, endothelial cell damage, and the recruitment of neutrophils to the lung. 27 The HMGB1-TLR4 signaling pathway has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of small intestinal damage induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and other forms of ALI. 9, 11 Thus, we hypothesized that HMGB1 may be involved in ALI and lung inflammation, and its downstream TLR4, p38MAPK, and AP-1 signaling pathways may act as potentially important mediators in the development of ALI. In this study, a rat liver I/R injury model was used to induce ALI. The levels of serum and pulmonary HMGB1 were examined. To study the role of TLR4 and its downstream p38MAPK and AP-1 signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of liver I/R injury-induced ALI, TLR4-small hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentivirus were used to inhibit TLR4 expression in rat lung tissue.",

We found that levels of serum and lung HMGB1 increased significantly after liver I/R injury; that TLR4, p38MAPK, and AP-1 signaling pathways were activated in the pathologic process of liver I/R injuryinduced ALI; and that ALI and lung inflammatory response can be attenuated by knockdown of TLR4 in the lung tissue. These results suggest that HMGB1 might be involved as a stimulating factor in liver I/R injury-induced ALI, and its downstream TLR4, p38MAPK, and AP-1 signaling pathways mediate this form of ALI.",

Features characteristic of lung injury were found after liver I/R injury by histological analysis, which was also confirmed by significantly decreased P/F ratios. Pulmonary levels of IL-1b were also significantly higher after liver I/R injury compared to the control group, which indicated lung inflammatory response. Similar results were found in previous studies; liver I/R injury induced lung edema, pulmonary neutrophil accumulation, and inflammatory chemokine expression. 3, 4, 30 In this study, P/F ratio was used as an index to characterize the ALI, and has not been reported previously. As stated above, our findings strongly suggested that liver I/R injury would ultimately lead to lung inflammatory response and ALI.",

            "text": "It has been demonstrated that liver I/R injury results in the activation of several inflammatory pathways, such as those for free radicals, cytokines, and neutrophil-mediated tissue damage. 31 The lung is frequently damaged by proinflammatory mediators released from the injured liver after liver IR, as the lungs are the first capillary bed that is reached by the blood after leaving the hepatic circulation. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] was recently found to act as a potent proinflammatory cytokine and participated in the development of systemic inflammatory response, when it was released into the extracellular environment. 32, 33 HMGB1 was also found to be involved in many other types of ALI, such as endotoxin, ventilator, and hemorrhage-induced ALI. [10] [11] [12] Interestingly, HMGB1 was reported to rapidly mobilize and release into system circulation from damaged liver in the setting of liver I/R injury. 34, 35 Previous studies also demonstrated that serum HMGB1 level remained elevated until 12 h after reperfusion, and that the removal of excessive serum HMGB1 with adsorption column improved the lung injury score. 28 Whether or not HMGB1 was transported to the lung and whether downstream signaling pathways in lung were activated was not investigated. In this study, similar results were obtained; serum HMGB1 increased significantly after liver I/R injury. More importantly, HMGB1 protein was found to be significantly higher in the lung tissue, which suggests that HMGB1 might be transported to lung tissue by systemic circulation. In addition, HMGB1 was reported to be released from macrophages and monocytes after exposure to proinflammatory cytokines. [36] [37] [38] [39] Given that proinflammatory cytokines might be transported to lung tissue after liver I/R injury, 3-7 lung cells might be activated by proinflammatory cytokines and then release HMGB1. 40, 41 For this reason, we examined HMGB1 mRNA in the lung tissue, and found that HMGB1 mRNA was significantly increased in the lung tissue after liver I/R injury. These results suggest that HMGB1, both released passively from damaged liver and actively from lung cells, might be involved in activating lung inflammatory response in liver I/R injury-induced ALI. Future experiments using an HMGB1-neutralizing antibody may help reveal its role in liver I/R injury-induced ALI.",

Activation of AP-1 in the lung tissue also increased after liver I/R injury, which was suppressed by TLR4 knockdown, indicating the involvement of AP-1 in TLR4-mediated lung inflammation after liver I/R injury. Activation of p38MAPK by TLR4 was reported to upregulate the inflammation-related genes and stimulated the release of IL-6, TNF, CXCL2, and CXCL10 protein in the lungs. 40 TLR4 mediated-activation of p38MAPK was also contributed to HMGB1-induced human lung endothelial cell cytoskeletal rearrangement and barrier disruption. 41 Moreover, AP-1 is a critical transcription factor required for the expression of many cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of ALI. 23, 44 Considering the roles of HMGB1, TLR4, p38MAPK, and AP-1 signaling pathways in ALI and lung inflammation, our findings implicated p38MAPK and AP-1 signaling pathways as potentially important mediators of the classic TLR4/ MyD88 signal-transduction pathways involved in lung inflammatory injury after liver I/R injury. In addition, activation of TLR4 can also activate other intracellular signaling systems, including the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), as well as the nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) pathways, all of which are pivotal regulators of inflammatory immune responses and cell survival and death. 45 Furthermore, studies are needed to investigate the involvements of ERK, JNK, and NF-kB in liver I/R injury-induced ALI.",
