The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the pulmonary pathology caused by H9N2 viral infection in mice. Six-to eight-week-old BALB/c mice were infected intranasally with 1 9 10 4 MID 50 of A/Chicken/Hebei/4/ 2008(H9N2) virus. Clinical signs, pathological changes and viral replication in lungs, arterial blood gas, and cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were observed at different time points after infection. A control group was infected intranasally with noninfectious allantoic fluid. H9N2-infected mice exhibited severe respiratory syndrome, with a mortality rate of 60%. Gross observations showed that infected lungs were highly edematous. Major histopathological changes in infected lungs included diffuse pneumonia and alveolar damage, with neutrophildominant inflammatory cellular infiltration, interstitial and alveolar edema, hemorrhage, and severe bronchiolitis/ peribronchiolitis. In addition, H9N2 viral infection resulted in severe progressive hypoxemia, lymphopenia, and a significant increase in neutrophils, tumor necrosis factor-a and interleukin-6 in BALF. The features described above satisfy the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

In H9N2-virus-infected mice, we observed that circulating leukocytes dramatically decreased in the blood and that a great number of inflammatory cells infiltrated the lungs. In addition, the neutrophils in BALF increased approximately 14-fold compared to control mice on day 5 p.i. These results suggested that a great number of leukocytes, especially neutrophils, were recruited from the bloodstream and sequestrated mainly in the lungs, and this might be involved in the host inflammation response and severe pulmonary lesions induced by H9N2 viral infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 388, "end": 391, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 392, "end": 394, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 395, "end": 398, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 399, "end": 402, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 403, "end": 406, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 407, "end": 410, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 411, "end": 414, "text": "29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Some studies have shown that H9N2 viruses could cause upper respiratory tract illnesses in humans [19] .
