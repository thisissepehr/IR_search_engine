Tissue cultured virus proved sensitive to ether, chloroform, 0.5 per cent trypsin, and to pH levels of 4.0 or lower. Infectivity was rapidly destroyed at 56 ~ C. Negatively stained naked virions of 100 nm average diameter were seen, and enveloped virions with 160--250 nm size. The capsid was built up of hollow cyellndrical capsomeres, arranged in equilateral triangles, carrying 5 capsomeres along each edge. Cubical symmetry and icosahedron structure yielded a total number of 162 capsomeres. All these biochemical and biophysical data lead to classification of HSIS virus into the genus herpesvirus. Biological properties described in a foregoing paper sustained such grouping, and indicated that the agent was a new avian herpesvirus for which the name herpesvirus strigis was proposed.",

Purified trypsin in 0.5 per cent concentration had a strongly inactivating effect on HSIS virus, as evident from Table 2 . Likewise, IBt~ virus, a bovine herpesvirus determined earlier as sensitive to trypsin treatment (8) and retested for control purposes alongside to HSIS virus, was confirmed as being sensitive to trypsin. ECBO virus, known from previous experiments as resistant to trypsin (8) , resisted to trypsin treatment as expected. As evident from Table 4 , HSIS virus for short periods of time was stable at --20 ~ +4 ~ or 37 ~ C. It proved, however, very sensitive to heating at 56 ~ C. IBR tested alongside displayed a similar temperature sensitivity fulfilling thereby another criterion of the herpesvirus group (2, 19) . ECBO virus, on the other hand, partially withstood heating to 56~ even during prolonged incubation, this in accordance with previous reports (MOLL and FI~LAYSO~, cit. 2). ",
