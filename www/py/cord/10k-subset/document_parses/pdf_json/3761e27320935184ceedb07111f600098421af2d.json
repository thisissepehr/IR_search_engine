The integration of isothermal amplification with electrical or electrochemical devices has enabled high-throughput nucleic acid-based assays with high sensitivity. We performed solid-phase rolling circle amplification (RCA) on the surface of a Au electrode, and detected RCA products in situ using chronocoulometry (CC) with [Ru (NH 3 ) 6 ] 3+ as the signaling molecule. Detection sensitivity for DNA and a microRNA (miR-143) was 100 fM and 1 pM, respectively. Furthermore, we conducted potentiometric DNA detection using an ethidium ion (Et + )-selective electrode (Et + ISE) for real-time monitoring of isothermal DNA amplification by primer-generation RCA (PG-RCA). The Et + ISE potential enabled real-time monitoring of the PG-RCA reaction in the range of 10 nM-1 \u03bcM of initial target DNA. Devices based on these electrochemical techniques represent a new strategy for replacing conventional PCR for on-site detection of nucleic acids of viruses or microorganisms.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Nucleic acid amplification for detection of DNA or RNA is an indispensable technique in many fields of life science, with applications ranging from molecular diagnosis of bacterial or viral species in blood or food to clinical studies on tumors or other diseases in the context of personalized medicine. The development of real-time monitoring of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) represented a major breakthrough in quantitative detection of nucleic acids. Most current real-time PCR systems employ fluorescence-based detection using intercalating reagents (e.g., SYBR Green) or sequence-specific reporter probes to quantitate amplified PCR products. The resulting curve of fluorescence intensity enables measurement of nucleic acid concentration over a wide range (8 orders of magnitude) with high sensitivity (<5 copies) and high precision (<2% standard deviation). Over the last few decades, several infectious diseases have emerged, including AIDS, SARS, influenza, and Ebola; these illnesses threaten the lives and health of people around the world. Consequently, global efforts are being made to control and monitor these emerging infectious diseases. In one approach within this broad strategy, miniaturized nucleic acid amplification systems have been intensively studied as alternatives for point-of-care testing. However, optical detection schemes limit the miniaturization of the total PCR system, and the addition of exogenous fluorescent reagents sometimes inhibits the DNA polymerase. Because they require minimal instrumentation and low electrical power, however, electrical/electrochemical detection methods provide promising alternative detection schemes that could overcome these issues in the context of point-of-care testing devices [1, 2] . Furthermore, nonoptical sensing devices can be easily fabricated using fine processing technology, and highly integrated sensor arrays can be realized using the advanced complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process. P. Bergveld created the first ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET)-based biosensor in 1970 [3] . ISFET (ion-sensitive fieldeffect transistor) biosensors are composed of sensor surfaces functionalized by immobilization of probe biomolecules used as transducers/detectors. Various types of bioanalytes can be coupled with ISFETs such as genetic ISFETs, cell-ISFETs, or immuno-ISFETs. ISFETs take advantage of the fact that field effect transistors (FETs) change their source-drain \"channel\" conductivity depending on the electric field of their environment. Essentially, the output signal is a gate voltage or drain current that changes charge density on the gate surface before/after the molecular recognition event. One of the most successful examples of commercialized products exploiting these technologies is the Ion Torrent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) semiconductor chip-based DNA sequencer, launched in 2012 [4] [5] [6] . As shown in Fig. 1 , millions of ion-sensitive field-effect transistors (ISFETs), which detect released protons during PCR, are integrated in a chip with a well structure. Template DNA strands are immobilized on the surface of microbeads, which are captured into the well structures. After single-base synthesis by DNA polymerase, the resulting pH change is detected by pH-sensitive ISFET to confirm the extension reaction. ISFETs have also been used as detectors for real-time PCR, replacing fluorescence detection. However, the electrical properties of ISFETs change significantly during PCR thermal cycles. To overcome this problem, current work has focused on combining of isothermal nucleic acid amplification (rather than PCR) with electrical/electrochemical devices [7, 8] . There are several electrochemical nucleic acid detection methods employing amperometry, voltammetry, and AC-impedance. Solid-phase and solution-phase nucleic acid amplifications combined with electrochemical methods are summarized in the Ref. [9] . Intercalator-or redox marker-mediated electron transfer on the sensor surface is employed as a manner of electrochemical signal readout. For isothermal nucleic acid amplification combined with electrochemical measurement, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and rolling circle amplification (RCA) are often used. Because these amplification processes are conducted by a strand-displacing DNA polymerase at a constant temperature, their performance is comparable to that of PCR. Thus, simpler, miniaturized highthroughput measurements for point-of-care testing devices could be realized by combining electro/electrochemical devices and isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1756, "end": 1759, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1760, "end": 1762, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2091, "end": 2094, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2912, "end": 2915, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2916, "end": 2919, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2920, "end": 2923, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 3699, "end": 3702, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 3703, "end": 3705, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 3951, "end": 3954, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2938, "end": 2944, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In this chapter, we describe quantitative detection of nucleic acids by monitoring the products of isothermal amplification using electrochemical devices, including our own research on this topic [10, 11] . 1.
