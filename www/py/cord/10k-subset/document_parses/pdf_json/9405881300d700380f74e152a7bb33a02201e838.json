Before the screening of 'healthy' individuals is widely adopted, the potential harms and benefits need to be assessed [7] . One important programmatic and scientific question is whether to target screening toward certain age groups, and/or to include an upper age limit on population screening programs since the benefits and harms of screening may not be consistent throughout the lifespan [4, 8] . Reducing morbidity and mortality risks and increasing lifespan may not be realized to the same degree among older individuals because of competing causes of death [8, 9] . Risks of recommended interventions for those who screen positive may differ, such as increased risk for perforation of the colon during colonoscopy among individuals over 75 [10, 11] . However, risks for insurance or employment discrimination may lessen for individuals over 65 who are more likely to be retired and are eligible for Medicare [12] . Likewise, older participants may perceive less personal benefit from learning genomic information, while perceiving greater familial benefit since children or grandchildren could gain from cascade testing [4, 13, 14] .",

Previously, we examined participants' perceptions of age eligibility criteria prior to receiving screening results [9] and found that participants of all ages perceived the same benefits of screening, including the potential for prevention and treatment, gaining peace of mind, sharing information with family, advancing science/research and helping others. Those who noted risks, including worry and discrimination, did not differ by age. Here, we report on the reactions of participants in GeneScreen who received positive results. ",

            "text": "Most interviewees expressed little concern about their positive genomic screening results. One reason for this was age. As depicted in Table 2 , this was an older group of individuals whose mean age was 64, reflecting the average age of the GeneScreen participants, which was 60. Those in their 60s and 70s noted that they would have worried more about the results if they were younger. For instance, when a participant with a positive result indicating a possible increased risk of long QT syndrome was asked if the result had changed anything in her routine, she replied, \"Well, I'm 74 so, you know, it's not like I was 20 and found out about this and worried about would I be able to live long enough to have children or not\" (Participant 10). Older participants also reasoned that symptoms would have already appeared if they were going to develop. For example, someone with a positive result indicating increased risk of hemochromatosis said he was not worried about his result since he is \"already 63 and [has] never experienced a problem with it\" (Participant 8). For these reasons, older participants noted that the results were more helpful to their families than to themselves. Another reason interviewees expressed little concern about their positive genomic screening results was the type of condition. As shown in Table 1 , half the participants tested positive for genetic variants in the HFE gene associated with increased risk of hemochromatosis, arguably the most benign condition on the panel and the one with the lowest penetrance. The 63 year old mentioned above stated that \"if you have to have [a genetic anomaly], this seems to be a pretty good one to have. It's not a high-risk problem\" (Participant 8). The type of result, along with his age, made him less concerned. Others with hemochromatosis genomic screening results were dealing with more pressing health concerns, including one woman recently diagnosed with breast cancer (Participant 5).",

Two participants received HFE hemochromatosis results for a second time. One, a 76 year old, said she was relieved she did not screen positive for genes related to cancer (Participant 4). The other, a 77 year old, said he tends to forget about his risk of hemochromatosis, so the result made him 'more aware of it again' (Participant 3). He planned to talk to his primary care physician about follow-up care, but when asked if the result would change any future plans, he commented, \"No, I'm going to be 78 and, at this age, there are so many other things that could go wrong.\" This again highlights the role of older age in interpretation of the significance of results, especially for conditions in which the penetrance or risk of developing clinical disease is very low.",

Given that the average age for all participants was 60, it is not surprising that those who received positive results were also older. Their assessments generally reflect a relatively low level of concern. This aligns with prior research that learning positive genetic results does not lead to significant psychological harm [21] [22] [23] . Additionally, revelations of genetic risk later in life are less worrisome, in part because much time has passed without any development of symptoms. The two participants with increased risk of long QT syndrome acknowledged that learning about this at a younger age could have yielded beneficial early interventions. At the same time, our older participants' absence of any long QT arrhythmia symptoms, despite having a positive result, is exemplary of the concern that population genomic screening could lead to overdiagnosis and unnecessary monitoring or interventions [24, 25] .",

For instance, the implications of receiving a long QT positive risk result are different at age 70 than at age 20, and are different than receiving a hemochromatosis risk result at any age. Diverse conditions on a panel (or, moreover, in genome sequencing) can also temper participants' interpretation of and reaction to their results, as evidenced by a participant who noted his positive hemochromatosis risk result was relatively 'good' in comparison to other results he could have received. In addition, participants' current and past health status mattered. Some recipients of positive results were dealing with health conditions they deemed of great urgency or import. Other participants already knew about their positive results, making the other negative results from the panel potentially more meaningful than the positive results. These findings remind us that context matters in how people respond to receiving screening results, and that in population screening programs, the information people already know when they undergo the screening cannot be controlled.",

However, by the second interview, almost no one had done anything further. This may have been consistent with clinical recommendations within 8 weeks of result receipt; that is, initial test results may have indicated that no further testing was needed. However, it is also possible that the importance of the result and interest in follow-up care faded for both participants and providers, given the type of result received or the lack of symptoms. Results from prior research on the relationship between receipt of genetic test results and adherence to prevention behavior has been mixed. Some studies show an increase in adherence [22, 26] . Others report that screening results have little impact on prevention behavior [27, 28] , including a study examining followup care-seeking behavior among asymptomatic individuals after receiving positive genetic results through direct to consumer testing [29] . Our study further reveals the complexity of predicting behavioral responses to genetic screening results over time when considering the age of those screened and the type of conditions included on the panel. We found initial interest or intent to act upon the result, but further research is needed on the potential disconnect between these temporal motivations and subsequent healthcare utilization within genomic screening contexts.",

In fact, many people who joined GeneScreen, especially older participants, cited this benefit as a reason to join [9] . Our interviews with people who received positive results reveal a mixed picture regarding family testing. Telling family members and encouraging them to be tested was mentioned by many in the first interview, but by the second interview, less than half reported that family members had been tested. Other studies have found that while rates of informing relatives of results may be quite high [33] , rates of cascade testing for eligible first-degree relatives are quite low [34, 35] . What is unclear, however, is whether low rates of cascade testing can be attributed to educational difficulties (e.g., probands who had the benefit of speaking with a genetic counselor about their results may struggle with communicating genetic information to relatives); lack of resources to make testing for family members easily accessible; the nature of the specific finding (e.g., dominant hereditary cancer risk vs recessive hereditary hemochromatosis); or some other combination of factors. Although efforts to implement precision prevention through genetic testing gain momentum, it is important to identify best practices in reaching family members to make testing efforts effective for both cost and health outcomes.",
