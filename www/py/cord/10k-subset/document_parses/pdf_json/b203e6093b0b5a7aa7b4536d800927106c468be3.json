[2] [3] [4] [5] Also known as cytotoxic T lymphocyteassociated serine esterase 1 or granzyme 2, GrB is a 32-kDa serine protease resembling chymotrypsin, and has homologues expressed in a number of different species. The gene product encoding GrB is B3500 bp long, contains five exons and four introns, and maps to chromosome 14 on the human genome. 6 Similar to caspases, GrB has a preference for cleaving peptides immediately adjacent to aspartate (Asp) residues. 7, 8 This specificity is due to the structure of the GrB active site, which contains an arginine (Arg) residue positioned at the side of the active site pocket. 9 An interaction between an Asp residue at the P1 position of the substrate and the Arg residue within the active site is key for enzyme-substrate interaction. 9 Although once believed to be expressed exclusively by natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), recent reports have shown that GrB can be expressed by various additional cell types. Under certain pro-inflammatory conditions, GrB can be expressed by CD4 \u00fe cells, mast cells, activated macrophages, neutrophils, basophils, dendritic cells (DCs), T regulatory cells, and nonimmune cell types such as smooth muscle cells (SMCs), chondrocytes, keratinocytes, type II pneumocytes, Sertoli cells, primary spermatocytes, granulosa cells, and syncytial trophoblasts. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] Granzyme expression is regulated at both the transcriptional and translational levels, and is influenced by many of the same factors that stimulate immune cell activation. Transcriptional activation of GrB within T lymphocytes involves activation of the T cell receptor and co-stimulation with cytokines. 21 The promoter region upstream of the GrB transcription start site contains binding sites for two transcription factors, activating transcription factor/cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (ATF/CREB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1), and two lymphoid specificfactors, Ikaros and core-binding factor (CBF/PEBP2). [22] [23] [24] [25] All transcription factors act together to regulate GrB expression, and mutations to any of the transcription factor-binding sites will abrogate GrB expression. 24, 26 Most lymphocytes constitutively express GrB transcripts and upregulate transcription when the lymphocyte has been activated. In T lymphocytes and NK cells, many of the extracellular factors that stimulate T cell activation will also augment GrB expression, including the composition of the cytokine milieu, the nature of receptor engagement, and the presence of helper or regulatory CD4 \u00fe T cell populations. 21 The post-transcriptional regulation of GrB is evident in many cells types, although the mechanisms involved in this regulation are not fully understood. Comparable levels of GrB transcripts are detected in resting and activated plasma DCs, but significantly higher levels of GrB protein is evident in the activated cells. 15 Resting mouse NK cells have an abundance of GrB transcripts, but not of GrB protein or cytotoxicity. 27 However, once the cells have been activated, there is a significant increase in GrB protein levels, with relatively little change in GrB transcript levels. 27 In contrast, human mast cells express high levels of GrB transcripts and relatively low levels of GrB protein. 28 The post-translational regulation of GrB is accomplished through several mechanisms that include the synthesis of GrB as a propeptide requiring proteolytic cleavage for activation and the tagging of GrB with a mannose-6-phosphate receptor (MPR) used to target the protease to the acidic lytic granule. 29 These mechanisms will be discussed in more detail in the Granzyme synthesis, storage and exocytosis section of this review.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 126, "end": 129, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 130, "end": 133, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 134, "end": 137, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 138, "end": 141, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 475, "end": 476, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 591, "end": 593, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 594, "end": 595, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 752, "end": 753, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 912, "end": 913, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1486, "end": 1490, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1491, "end": 1495, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1496, "end": 1500, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1501, "end": 1505, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1506, "end": 1510, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1511, "end": 1515, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1516, "end": 1520, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1521, "end": 1525, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1526, "end": 1530, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1531, "end": 1535, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1536, "end": 1540, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1846, "end": 1848, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2167, "end": 2171, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2172, "end": 2176, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2177, "end": 2181, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2182, "end": 2186, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2347, "end": 2350, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2351, "end": 2353, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2763, "end": 2765, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3088, "end": 3090, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3192, "end": 3194, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3351, "end": 3353, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3465, "end": 3467, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 3770, "end": 3772, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION Granzymes"}, {"text": "Specific inhibitors regulate the activity of GrB to minimize accidental GrB-mediated apoptosis. The only known endogenous inhibitor of GrB in humans is protease inhibitor-9 (PI-9), which is a potent inhibitor of GrB and is expressed by immune cells as protection against accidental cytosolic GrB leakage. 30, 31 Endothelial cells, vascular SMCs, and hepatocytes have also shown an ability to express PI-9 as a means of protection from GrB-mediated cytotoxicity. [32] [33] [34] [35] High levels of PI-9 expression can be found in DCs, T cells, and endothelial cells of lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissue, as well as in cells of immune-privileged tissues, including the eyes, testes, ovaries, and placenta. 36 In mice, serine protease inhibitor 6 shares homology with human PI-9, in which it functions to regulate GrB activity. 37 Recently, Sipione et al 38 discovered an inhibitor of mouse and human GrB, serpina3n, expressed by mouse Sertoli cells. Serpina3n shares homology with the human a-1-antichymotrypsin, which interestingly does not appear to show any inhibitory effect on GrB in humans. GrB activity may also be indirectly influenced by the actions of granzyme H (GrH) and granzyme M (GrM). GrM may inhibit the action of human PI-9, thereby promoting GrB activity, 39 whereas GrH has the ability to cleave the adenoviral protein Ad5-100K in an effort to counter viral defense against GrB. 40 Given its role in immune-mediated cytotoxicity, increased attention has been devoted toward GrB in an effort to elucidate the mechanisms of CTLs and NK cell-mediated elimination of cells. Traditional views on the function of GrB have, for the most part, been limited to its intracellular proapoptotic role. However, as discussed below, recent reports suggest that there may also be perforin-and/or apoptosisindependent roles for GrB in disease progression.

The major lytic proteins packaged within the granules are granzymes and the pore-forming protein perforin. Traditional models indicate that GrB delivery into a target cell is mediated by perforin; however, the mechanism by which this is accomplished remains an active area of investigation. Perforin is a Ca 2 \u00fe -dependent pore-forming protein that multimerizes in the target cell's plasma membrane, forming 5-20 nm pores. 61, 62 Early models suggested that perforin facilitates the movement of granzymes into the cytoplasm of the target cell through the formation of pores; however, this model was challenged when it was discovered that granzymes could be endocytosed without perforin. [63] [64] [65] [66] More recent models show that GrB binds to the MPR and is rapidly endocytosed by the target cell. 67 This process is likely dynamin-dependent and results in the formation of endosomes containing GrB and perforin; however, a dynamin-independent role has been proposed. [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] GrB is then released from the endosomes into the cytosol, using a perforin-dependent mechanism where it can target cellular substrates and initiate cell death. 69, 72, 73 However, although increasing evidence supports a role for MPR in GrB uptake, controversy does exist with regard to the dynamin/MPR mechanism as some evidence suggests this may not be required for GrB entry. It should also be noted that transfer of GrB to the endosome can occur in a perforin-independent manner. 69, 71, 72, 74 Although a role beyond facilitating granzyme entry into cells is not known, perforin is required for CL-driven GrB-mediated apoptosis, as perforin deficiencies are associated with impaired lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity. Perforin-deficient mice are highly susceptible to viral infection 75, 76 and cancer. 77, 78 In humans, perforin deficiencies are associated with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis, an autosomal-recessive disorder resulting in uncontrolled T and NK cell activation and proliferation. [79] [80] [81] Although MPR and perforin are believed to be important for GrB delivery, several groups have reported alternative mechanisms for GrB entry. First, serglycin-GrB complexes, which interact with perforin, can incorporate into target cell membranes in vitro and deliver GrB to the cytoplasm without the formation of perforin-induced pores. 52, 53, 68, 82 This process was shown by Veugelers et al 67 to be enhanced by the cell surface receptor, heparan sulfate. GrB entry may also be facilitated by other cell-surface-bound proteins, such as heat shock protein-70 (Hsp-70). 83 Hsp-70 present on the surface of tumor cells not only facilitates the movement of GrB into the tumor cell but also stimulates the production and delivery of GrB by NK cells. 84 GrB-induced Apoptosis GrB delivery and substrate identification in apoptotic cell death has been the subject of much research.

One of the first substrates to be identified for GrB was pro-caspase-3. 85 GrB-activated caspase-3 results in the processing of several cellular substrates integral to eliciting the apoptotic phenotype, including the inhibitor of caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease, the DNA damage sensor, poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP), nuclear lamins, and many others (reviewed in Hengartner 86 ). Several other caspases, including caspase-2, -6, -7, -8, and -10, are reported to serve as direct substrates for GrB in vitro; however, only cleavage of caspase-3, -7 and -8 has been established in vivo. [87] [88] [89] A major mechanism by which GrB is believed to induce cell death is through the cleavage of the BH3-only protein Bid into a truncated form, gtBid, which then translocates to the mitochondrion and disrupts mitochondrial membrane integrity through interactions with the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and/ or Bak. [90] [91] [92] Disruption of the mitochondrial membrane integrity increases membrane permeability, leading to the release of apoptogenic factors, such as cytochrome c, smac/DIABLO, Omi/HtrA2, and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). 93, 94 Cytochrome c release stimulates the formation of a macromolecular complex consisting of cytochrome c, dATP, apaf-1, and pro-caspase-9 known as the apoptosome, which results in the activation of caspase-9 and the subsequent activation of caspases-3 and -7. GrB also cleaves the anti-apoptotic pro tein Mcl-1, which results in the release of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bim, followed by mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and cytochrome c release. 95 Several other intracellular substrates have been identified including of PARP, the nuclear mitotic apparatus protein, cytoskeletal components such as a-tubulin, the nuclearenvelope intermediate filament protein (lamin B), and ROCKII. [96] [97] [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] GrB has also been shown to target proteins involved in cellular homeostasis and the stress response, including Hsp-70 and Hsp-90 from the heat shock family of proteins, and also the heat-shock-associated proteins Hip, Hop, and Bag1-L. [105] [106] [107] [108] Although the mechanisms of CL/NK-mediated GrB-induced apoptosis have been studied for some time, the relative contribution of these pathways to disease pathogenesis is less understood. With the discovery of GrB expression in nonimmune cell types such as chondrocytes and keratinocytes, the effect of apoptosis (if any) mediated by these cells in disease has yet to be determined and presents a new role for GrB in disease pathogenesis. However, as several GrBexpressing cells may not co-express perforin and/or form IS with target cells, it is likely that these cells would exert more of an extracellular impact on disease.

However, the granzymes were originally identified as both intracellular and extracellular proteases, and over the past few years, increased research has focused on extracellular GrB activity. [109] [110] [111] [112] [113] Several groups have reported that GrB is present in the ECM of tissue and can be found extracellularly in bodily fluids. 54, 111, 114 Several novel extracellular substrates for GrB have been identified, potential implications of ECM cleavage have been described, and extracellular GrB activity has been linked to arthritis, vascular pathologies, and other diseases. Although cell types such as keratinocytes, chondrocytes, and neutrophils can express both GrB and peforin simultaneously, other cell types such as mast cells express GrB in the absence of perforin and GrA, suggesting that GrB may act exclusively extracellularly in these cells. 11, 20, [115] [116] [117] This is probably due to the GrB gene localization to a cluster of genes along with mast cell proteases (separate from the perforin and GrA genes). As a result, GrB can be expressed by myeloid cells (DCs, granulocytes) and others upon activation, independently of perforin. 15, 17, 118 GrB is released from cytotoxic granules upon target cell recognition. Upon reaching the neutral pH of the extracellular environment, GrB is instantly active and can readily cleave susceptible extracellular substrates. The stimuli involved in GrB release have not been fully elucidated; however, several mechanisms have been described to date. GrB may leak into the ECM from the IS during target cell engagement, it may be released non-specifically upon TCR signaling or after prolonged IL-2 stimulation, and it is likely released after other unidentified stimuli. 119, 120 Recently, Prakash et al 121 found that GrB is constitutively released from CTLs and NK cells in vivo and that GrB release can occur in the absence of target cell engagement. GrB is released in both active and inactive forms, suggesting that there may be an extracellular GrB activator for the zymogen form of the enzyme. 121 The pro-form of GrB may be regulated outside cells in a process similar to the extracellular regulation of other ECM proteases, such as the pro-forms of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), although this has yet to be defined. Besides NK cells and CTLs, other immune and nonimmune cell types also express and secrete GrB; however, the stimuli and signaling pathways regulating GrB release are largely unknown in these cell types. Figure 1 Classical granzyme B (GrB)/perforin-mediated apoptosis pathway. GrB internalization is facilitated by perforin. Upon internalization, GrB initiates apoptosis primarily through the cleavage of Bid into a truncated form (gtBid) that triggers mitochondrial cytochrome c release and apoptosome formation leading to caspase activation and manifestation of the apoptosis phenotype. GrB can also bypass the mitochondrial pathway and initiate caspase activation directly and/or cleave caspase substrates such as the inhibitor of caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease (ICAD), thereby allowing CAD to translocate to the nucleus to fragment DNA. GrB also cleaves the nuclear membrane protein lamin B, resulting in a loss of integrity of the nuclear membrane.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 305, "end": 310, "text": "[109]", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 311, "end": 316, "text": "[110]", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 317, "end": 322, "text": "[111]", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 323, "end": 328, "text": "[112]", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 329, "end": 334, "text": "[113]", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}, {"start": 456, "end": 459, "text": "54,", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 460, "end": 464, "text": "111,", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 465, "end": 468, "text": "114", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 979, "end": 982, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 983, "end": 986, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 987, "end": 992, "text": "[115]", "ref_id": "BIBREF115"}, {"start": 993, "end": 998, "text": "[116]", "ref_id": "BIBREF116"}, {"start": 999, "end": 1004, "text": "[117]", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 1278, "end": 1281, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1282, "end": 1285, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1286, "end": 1289, "text": "118", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 1854, "end": 1858, "text": "119,", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 1859, "end": 1862, "text": "120", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 1887, "end": 1890, "text": "121", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}, {"start": 2184, "end": 2187, "text": "121", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2613, "end": 2621, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "EXTRACELLULAR GrB ACTIVITY"}, {"text": "GrB is present in the plasma of healthy individuals with median levels of approximately 20-40 pg/ml reported in the literature. 54, 111 Serum levels of GrB are elevated in several diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection, Epstein-Barr virus infection, arthritis, and others. 54, 111, 114 Apart from the potential blood clotting implications that will be described later, it is worth noting that although circulating GrB may be useful as a biomarker for several diseases, it may not have a large effect on disease progression and may be present in the serum due to leakage from tissues where it is more abundant. In diseased tissues, particularly in areas of inflammation, extracellular granzyme concentration would be expected to be much higher than that in the blood.

Furthermore, many of these cleavage fragments are unique to GrB and are not synthesized in other forms of cell death. Casciola-Rosen et al 205 have described some of these GrB-specific autoantigens in great detail and several disease-specific examples are provided in this review. Of 29 well-defined autoantigens, 21 in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma (SSc), Sj\u00f6gren syndrome (SS), and myositis are directly cleaved by GrB into unique autoantigenic fragments. Non-autoantigens were either not cleaved by GrB or cleaved into fragments identical to those cleaved during other forms of apoptosis and as a result are not unique. This suggests these non-unique fragments were already tolerized during immune cell development and are not autoantigenic, whereas the uniquely cleaved autoantigens would have escaped tolerance. 205 As GrB appears to selectively and uniquely generate a wide variety of autoantigens in several autoimmune diseases and as there is a high-titer autoantibody response to most of these antigens in autoimmune patients, GrB has been identified as a critical enzyme in autoimmune disease pathogenesis. 205, 263 SLE SLE is a disease involving a specific autoimmune response toward nuclear autoantigens. High amounts of soluble nucleosomes have been found in SLE serum and SLE macrophages have reduced phagocytic activity, suggesting there is a defect in the clearance of apoptotic cell material. 264, 265 This may allow for a high availability of autoantigens for DCs to process and present, as this cell type is believed to be a driving force in SLE pathogenesis. 266 In addition to DCs, CTLs are an important cell type in SLE autoimmunity. Effector CTLs from patients with SLE disease flares show greater perforin/GrB immunopositivity and the frequency of these cells coincides with disease progression. These CTLs also generate soluble nucleosomes and GrB-specific autoantigens, suggesting they contribute to the initiation of autoimmunity. Interestingly, in the presence of SLE serum, DCs can facilitate CTL differentiation into active effector cells, which are no different from those in SLE patients, providing further evidence that DCs are capable of presenting autoantigens to CTLs and inducing their activation in an autoimmune response. 206 GrB has been implicated as a key protease in autoantigen processing in SLE and generates fragments unique to those of other autoimmunity-associated proteases such as the caspases. For example, GrB is capable of producing autoantigens from the non-homologous end-joining pathway of DNA double-strand break repair. Sera from SLE patients contained antibodies against XRCC4, and three of these patients recognized the specific GrB cleavage epitope, suggesting GrB may produce these fragments in vivo. 207 However, in a mouse model of autoimmunity in which GrB-deficient mice were injected with the mineral oil pristane, GrB knockout mice still produced autoantibodies and had a higher mortality than mice expressing GrB, suggesting that GrB may not be a critical enzyme in autoantigen synthesis. However, the latter study would not rule out the possibility that the other granzymes may be contributing to autoantigen formation in this model. In addition, the authors suggest that GrB may be protective because of its role in viral clearance, as viral infection is believed to promote autoimmunity. 208, 267 SSc SSc or systemic sclerosis is an inflammatory connective tissue disease that affects the vasculature and results in blood flow reduction, tissue ischemia, and wound healing defects. GrB cleaves several SSc autoantigens including topoisomerase I, Figure 2 Putative extracellular (perforin-independent) roles for GrB in age-related chronic inflammatory disorders. During a number of chronic inflammatory conditions, GrB accumulates extracellularly in the tissues, blood stream, and other bodily fluids. GrB retains its activity in the blood, suggesting that, unlike MMPs and cathepsins, extracellular inhibitors of GrB activity may be limited. GrB can cleave proteins involved in structural integrity and wound healing such as fibronectin. GrB can also cleave proteins related to clotting (fibrinogen, vWF, plasminogen). GrB can induce detachment-mediated cell death (anoikis) through the cleavage of ECM. Although yet to be shown for granzymes, MMP-mediated fragments of fibronectin and elastin show chemotactic properties and may enhance the immune response in atherosclerosis. Fragments may also exhibit bioactive properties and may be able to release cytokines from the matrix. Granzymes may also have a role in the cleavage of cell surface receptors as seen with Notch1 and FGFR1. GrB production from PBMCs of unstable angina pectoris (UAP) patients was significantly higher than those with stable angina (SAP). GrB production from PBMCs increased with the increasing TIMI risk score in UAP patients. The percentage of GrB-positive lymphocytes to CD3-positive lymphocytes in UAP patients was significantly higher than in SAP NOR-90, fibrillarin, and others. 205 Some SSc patients also develop complications from the disorder, such as ischemic digital loss (IDL). 211 Serum samples from SSc patients with IDL contain autoantibodies for the specific GrB cleavage fragments of CENP-C, pointing toward GrB as a mediator of IDL. 211 Moreover, as there is a need for predictive biomarkers for digital loss in SSc, specific IDL autoantigens cleaved by GrB maybe a useful tool for diagnosis. In addition to autoimmunity, extracellular cleavage fragments created by GrB also have other functional roles in SSc. The reduction of blood flow characteristic of SSc may be due to an imbalance between proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors that control new vessel growth. Plasma from SSc patients shows reduced endothelial cell migration and tube formation in vitro. The serum sample was found to contain higher levels of the antiangiogenic protein angiostatin, which Mulligan-Kehoe et al 130 found to be synthesized by GrB through the cleavage of plasminogen (in the presence of another granule protein) as well as from plasmin.

[176] [177] [178] [179] [180] Vascular Diseases Atherosclerosis Atherosclerosis a lipid-driven inflammatory disease responsible for the majority of heart attacks, strokes, and lower limb loss, and, as such, is now the leading cause of death world-wide. [294] [295] [296] [297] The most abundant inflammatory and immune cells in atherosclerotic lesions are T lymphocytes and macrophages, and their role in atherosclerosis is well documented. 189,298-300 Small populations of neutrophils, mast cells, DCs, and NK cells also are present. [301] [302] [303] The role of GrB in atherosclerotic plaque progression is illustrated in Figure 3c . Until recently, GrB expression was believed to be limited to CTLs and NK cells. However, CD4 \u00fe /CD8 \u00fe macrophages infiltrating inflammation sites and lipid-laden foam cells within atherosclerotic plaques also express GrB. 10, 189, 304 In atherosclerotic lesions, GrB expression increases with disease severity and is observed in both lipid-rich areas and cellular regions surrounding the core of developing plaques, as well as in the shoulder regions of advanced plaques. 10 Within the intima and media, GrB is found within SMCs, macrophages, and T cells, but can also be detected extracellularly. Furthermore, GrB is found to localize to TUNEL-positive foam cells, suggesting that it could be contributing to cell death in lipid-rich regions of developing plaques. 10 The presence of GrB in advanced atherosclerotic lesions and its association with increased disease severity suggests that GrB may affect plaque stability. Indeed, elevated levels of GrB are detected in the plasma of patients with atherosclerosis, with the highest levels detected in patients with unstable plaques, lending support to the hypothesis that GrB influences plaque instability. In a study by Skjelland et al, 232 increased GrB levels in the plasma corresponded to carotid plaque instability and increased incidence of cerebrovascular events in humans. Elevated GrB production was also observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from patients with unstable angina pectoris compared with cells from patients with stable angina pectoris. 233 Thus, evidence to date indicates that GrB might be involved in the initiation of plaque instability and rupture. In addition, the repercussions of elevated GrB levels may extend beyond plaque rupture and into post-infarct ventricular remodeling as Kondo et al recently reported elevated GrB levels in the plasma of patients with myocardial infarction (MI) in both the acute and subacute phases. They also found that sustained levels of GrB was an independent factor for late-stage left ventricular remodeling. 234 The mechanisms by which GrB may contribute to plaque stability include ECM fragmentation, release of ECM-sequestered cytokines, and/or induction of macrophage or SMC apoptosis in the fibrous cap. To the latter point, Choy et al 135 showed, using a cell culture model, that GrB could induce SMC apoptosis in the absence of perforin through the disruption of SMC-ECM interactions and induction of anoikis. Conversely, levels of the endogenous GrB inhibitor PI-9 in SMC markedly reduced in unstable plaques versus stable plaques, implying a role for GrB-induced SMC apoptosis. It should be noted, however, that although the GrB-inhibitory role of PI-9 is well-established, its effects on GrB as a potential mechanism were not considered nor discussed in the latter study. Rather, reduced PI-9 was associated with increased SMC caspase-1 activity and IL-1b production. 35 With regard to its extracellular function in atherosclerosis, GrB is capable of cleaving multiple ECM proteins, including fibronectin, vitronectin, and laminin. 134, 135 These data suggest that GrB may contribute to plaque instability through both intracellular and extracellular activities, leading to the formation of a necrotic core and thinning of the fibrous cap, and ultimately plaque rupture. 10 Although ongoing, preliminary studies have been reported using apolipoprotein E \u00c2 GrB double knockout mice in which GrB deficiency was found to be associated with reduced atherosclerosis, suggesting that this protease may be important in this disease. 305 Although GrB appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, it should be noted that the precise effects of elevated GrB levels may depend on the stage of lesion development. During the early stages of lesion development, GrB-induced SMC apoptosis may be a beneficial way to reduce intimal hyperplasia, 306 whereas in more advanced lesions, increased SMC apoptosis may decrease plaque stability through decreased cellularity and increased ECM proteolysis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 365, "end": 369, "text": "173,", "ref_id": "BIBREF175"}, {"start": 370, "end": 373, "text": "169", "ref_id": "BIBREF171"}, {"start": 660, "end": 663, "text": "168", "ref_id": "BIBREF170"}, {"start": 810, "end": 813, "text": "170", "ref_id": "BIBREF172"}, {"start": 1025, "end": 1028, "text": "176", "ref_id": "BIBREF178"}, {"start": 1291, "end": 1296, "text": "[176]", "ref_id": "BIBREF178"}, {"start": 1297, "end": 1302, "text": "[177]", "ref_id": "BIBREF179"}, {"start": 1303, "end": 1308, "text": "[178]", "ref_id": "BIBREF180"}, {"start": 1309, "end": 1314, "text": "[179]", "ref_id": "BIBREF181"}, {"start": 1315, "end": 1320, "text": "[180]", "ref_id": "BIBREF182"}, {"start": 1544, "end": 1549, "text": "[294]", "ref_id": "BIBREF298"}, {"start": 1550, "end": 1555, "text": "[295]", "ref_id": "BIBREF299"}, {"start": 1556, "end": 1561, "text": "[296]", "ref_id": "BIBREF300"}, {"start": 1562, "end": 1567, "text": "[297]", "ref_id": "BIBREF301"}, {"start": 1826, "end": 1831, "text": "[301]", "ref_id": "BIBREF305"}, {"start": 1832, "end": 1837, "text": "[302]", "ref_id": "BIBREF306"}, {"start": 1838, "end": 1843, "text": "[303]", "ref_id": "BIBREF307"}, {"start": 2150, "end": 2153, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2154, "end": 2158, "text": "189,", "ref_id": "BIBREF192"}, {"start": 2159, "end": 2162, "text": "304", "ref_id": "BIBREF308"}, {"start": 2400, "end": 2402, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2694, "end": 2696, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 3117, "end": 3120, "text": "232", "ref_id": "BIBREF235"}, {"start": 3456, "end": 3459, "text": "233", "ref_id": "BIBREF236"}, {"start": 3970, "end": 3973, "text": "234", "ref_id": "BIBREF237"}, {"start": 4202, "end": 4205, "text": "135", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 4839, "end": 4841, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 5003, "end": 5007, "text": "134,", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}, {"start": 5008, "end": 5011, "text": "135", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 5242, "end": 5244, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 5497, "end": 5500, "text": "305", "ref_id": "BIBREF309"}, {"start": 5819, "end": 5822, "text": "306", "ref_id": "BIBREF310"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1916, "end": 1925, "text": "Figure 3c", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Other skin disorders"}, {"text": "Transplantation is the recommended therapy for end-stage organ disease.
