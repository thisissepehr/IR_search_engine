An alternate proposed mechanism suggests that intracranial pressure (ICP) is transmitted directly through venous channels rather than along the optic sheath [4] . Our case provides evidence of direct extension of subarachnoid blood into the globe as the mechanism in some cases of Terson Syndrome. The blood is clearly seen within the sheath and is continuous with the intraocular collection. The high ICP associated with aneurismal rupture likely forces subarachnoid blood along the nerve-sheath complexes into the globes. An extrusion mechanism is also supported by a recent case report detailing a patient with SAH studied with magnetic resonance imaging [5] . Other mechanisms for hemorrhage may also exist, as Terson Syndrome can be seen in cases of intracranial hypertension without SAH. ",

We have therefore decided to exclude this group. The distribution of CO poisoned victims according to the year's months confirmed that the peak of poisoning occurs mainly during the winter. The SOFA score was higher in the S group compared with the C group (0.38 vs 2,17; p<0.0001). A CO score equal to 4 was present in 33% vs 1% respectively in S vs C group (p<0.001). All those patients were ventilated. In the under group of patients having a CO score at 3, 0% (0/101) of CO poisoned patients vs 18.4% (7/38) of smoke poisoned patients were ventilated (p<0.001). These patients were intubated either during transport or in the intensive care and none of them received hydroxycobalamine during the first aid (before intubation). The laboratory data showed in the S group a higher lactates level (2,2 vs 3,9 mmol/l; p=0.005) and lower initial PaO 2 /F I O 2 ratio (365 vs 306; p=0.002). Nine percent of the S group present a Murray score at 4 vs 0 % for C group (p<0.0001). Pneumonia, shock and death were significantly more frequent in the S group (respectively 8,6 % vs 0,8 %, p<0.0005; 11,2 % vs 0;8 %, p<0.0001; and 17,9 % vs 1,2 %, p <0.0001) . As expected the smoke poisoned group has a higher mortality than pure CO group (mortality 17% vs overall mortality 5.9%). At equivalent CO gravity score, mortality and complications are always more frequent in the smoke poisoned group. The smoke poisoned group has a high risk of degradation. Those patients require specific monitoring and support and probably early administration of hydroxycobalamine.",

Previous analyses of pooled Phase II/III trials have demonstrated that lacosamide provides additional efficacy when added to a broad range of AEDs(Rosenfeld et al 2008). To further evaluate efficacy and safety of lacosamide added to more traditional sodium-channel blocking AEDs, post hoc exploratory analyses were performed on pooled Phase II/III trial data grouped by primary mechanism of action of patients' concomitant AEDs.",

Transfusion practices were comparatively more restrictive with low-grade SAH [7.9 (7.7-8.0) g/dl] (p<0.0001) and more liberal with delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) [8.6 (8.5-8.7) g/dl] (p<0.0001).

In multivariable analysis, neurosurgeons had more liberal Hb goals than intensivists (p=0.003), and were more likely to administer two, rather than one unit of RBCs (56% vs. 19%, p<0.0001). Use of protocols was predictive of more restrictive practices (p=0.03 for low-grade SAH) and multi-modal neurological monitoring was associated with a more liberal approach (p=0.04 for DCI). The proportion of clinicians more likely to transfuse based on P bt O 2 values of <15, 15-20 and 20-25 mmHg was 65%, 22%, and 1%, respectively ( Figure 2) . The corresponding proportions for lactate: pyruvate ratios of >40, 35-40, 30-35 and 25-30 were 36%, 18%, 5% and 2%, respectively.",
