These features constitute major determinants of virion stability in the environment and virion resistance against physical and chemical agents. Reovirus (ReoV) is the general term most commonly used for all virus strains that infect humans and nonhuman animals. Several studies have demonstrated the frequent occurrence of ReoV in wastewaters and natural waters, including surface and ground waters from different geographical areas. Most of these studies have reported higher concentrations of ReoV than any other enteric virus analyzed. They are more commonly isolated in chlorinedisinfected wastewaters than other enteric viruses, and appear to survive longer in water. The ability of ReoV to form large aggregates, even with different types of enteric viruses (e.g., poliovirus) and their ability to undergo mechanisms of gene segment reassortment among different serotypes may also explain their greater stability. Different approaches have been applied for concentration of ReoV from water; however, the recovery efficiency of the filtration methods has not been fully evaluated. Recently, molecular methods for identification of ReoV strains and quantification of virus genome have been developed. Studies have shown that the overall detection sensitivity of ReoV RNA is enhanced through initial replication of infectious virions in cell culture. More studies are needed to specifically address unresolved issues about the fate and distribution of ReoV in the environment since this virus is not commonly included in virological investigations.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Reovirus (acronym for respiratory enteric orphan virus) belongs to a highly diverse group of nonenveloped and double-stranded RNA viruses (dsRNA) classified within the Reoviridae family. Orthoreovirus is the genus name (the true ''reovirus'') for one of the 15 genera of the Reoviridae viruses that infect mammals, birds, and reptiles. This designation distinguishes the orthoreoviruses from other members of the family that infect plants, fish, mollusks, fungi, and insects (Clarke and Tyler 2010; Day 2009; Dermody et al. 2013) . The Mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV, prototypical member of the Reoviridae) is the type species of the Orthoreovirus genus that was initially associated with a subgroup of respiratory and enteric viruses present in healthy humans with minimal or no symptoms of respiratory or enteric disease; therefore, the virus was considered an ''orphan'' (Sabin 1959; Jackson and Muldoon 1973; Norman and Lee 2000; Day 2009; Dermody et al. 2013) . Reovirus (ReoV) is a general term that refers to the MRV and is most frequently used throughout this review. Current studies indicate that ReoV may be the most common enteric virus found in raw and treated wastewater; however, the concentration efficiency of ReoV in these matrices including natural waters has not been thoroughly evaluated. This review summarizes previous and recent findings about the occurrence of ReoV in water. Recent progress in concentration and molecularbased detection methods combined with traditional cell & Walter Q.

ReoVs infect their hosts by the fecal-oral and respiratory routes. Infectious virions enter the body by ingestion of contaminated food or inhalation of virus-containing aerosols. At both portals of entry, ReoVs infect epithelial cells and disseminate to peripheral sites where they cause disease (Boehme et al. 2013) . Studies indicate that ReoVs are neurotropic viruses that use both bloodborne and neural pathways to spread systemically within their hosts to cause disease (Boehme et al. 2013) . Most ReoV infections in humans occur in infancy or early childhood; therefore, full seroconversion against all three major serotypes is attained by late childhood, (around 5 years of age) (Norman and Lee 2000; Day 2009; Dermody et al. 2013) .

The inner-capsid shell or core particle has an internal diameter of approximately 50-60 nm and encloses the genome. In addition, the inner capsid possesses 12 prominent projections or spikes situated as though on vertices of a regular icosahedron. The outercapsid shell is 38 nm in diameter and surrounds the core particle . The 10 dsRNA genome segments are divided into three size classes based upon their migration in polyacrylamide gels: three large (L: L1, L2, L3), three medium (M: M1, M2, M3), and four small (S: S1, S2, S3, S4) segments. These segments encode mRNAs for synthesis of 12 viral proteins that execute the ReoV replication program in a variety of cell types within diverse animal hosts. Eight of these segments encode a single protein, while two encode two proteins each. Eight of the 12 proteins are structural components of virions (k1, k2, k3, l1, l2, r1, r2, and r3) and four are nonstructural (lNS, lNSC, r1S, and rNS). The function of these virus-encoded proteins has been described in detail elsewhere (Schiff 1998; Dermody et al. 2013) . Cell attachment r1 protein is the most type-specific reovirus protein. It is also the reovirus-hemagglutinin and is a major determinant of host-range/tissue specificity and of the nature of interaction of reovirus with cells of the immune system (Schiff 1998; Dermody et al. 2013 ). Interestingly, studies have shown that proteins r3 and l1 interact extensively within the outer capsid and the extensive contacts between r3 and l1 molecules have been suggested to stabilize outer-capsid structure and thereby facilitate survival of virions during transmission of ReoV between hosts (Nibert et al. 1995; Schiff 1998) . Furthermore, outer-capsid proteins r3, l1, and r1 have each been associated with the stability of ReoV particles against particular physicochemical agents (Drayna and Fields 1982a, b) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 122, "end": 125, "text": "[?]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 130, "end": 133, "text": "[-]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 340, "end": 363, "text": "(Gomatos and Tamm 1963;", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 364, "end": 383, "text": "Harris et al. 1987;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 384, "end": 411, "text": "Drayna and Fields 1982a, b;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 412, "end": 432, "text": "Norman and Lee 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 1463, "end": 1476, "text": "(Schiff 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 1477, "end": 1497, "text": "Dermody et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1746, "end": 1759, "text": "(Schiff 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 1760, "end": 1779, "text": "Dermody et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2082, "end": 2102, "text": "(Nibert et al. 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 2103, "end": 2115, "text": "Schiff 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 2273, "end": 2301, "text": "(Drayna and Fields 1982a, b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Organization of the Reov Particle and Genome"}, {"text": "Three morphologically similar groups of ReoV have been described based on genetic divergence and antigenic properties among serotypes.

These three serotypes currently circulate in humans and other mammals (Boehme et al. 2013) . They are closely related in sequence and can exchange their ten genomic dsRNA segments by genetic recombination which occurs primarily through reassortment. This process generates some progeny (reassortants) that stably behaves as the wild type that can be grown under nonpermissive temperature conditions (Shiff 1998). It is known that T1L and T3D share approximately 25 % identity in their r1 protein, while other outer capsid and viral core proteins are highly conserved with 90-98 % identity (Douville et al. 2008) .

The relative concentration to other enteric viruses is difficult to judge because of different methods for recovery from the sludge and cell lines used for assay in the different studies. Also, quantitative assessment of removal of naturally occurring ReoV is difficult because extracting data on the operation of the processes is often not provided in enough detail.

(2015) precipitation have been most commonly used for the secondary concentration step (Wyn-Jones 2007). Very few studies have evaluated the recovery efficiency of ReoV from water. It is very important since the sorption behavior of virus particles is governed by electrostatic interactions which are given by the virus isoelectric point (IEP); this is a characteristic parameter of the virion in equilibrium with its environmental water chemistry (Michen and Graule 2010) . In this situation, the sorption behavior of a particular virus may substantially differ from the most common human viruses (i.e., poliovirus) or viral surrogates (i.e., bacteriophages) used in recovery efficiency experiments. For instance, reported isoelectric points for poliovirus strains range from 4.0 to 7.4, MS2 coliphage 2.2-4.0, and ReoV type 3 from 3.8 to 3.9 (Michen and Graule 2010) . The detection of ReoV in water concentrates has been accomplished through different assay methods. As previously mentioned, virus replication in continuous cell lines of monkey kidneys was initially applied for isolating ReoV from water; however, they have the ability to infect many continuous mammalian cell lines maintained in clinical laboratories . The identification of ReoV in water based on observation of typical cythopathic effect (CPE) has been applied simultaneously with quantitative assays such as hemagglutination or immunological methods which quantify the presence of infectious and noninfectious virus particles (Condit 2013) . ReoV produces a very characteristic cytopathogenic effect (CPE) in monkey kidney cell lines. The cells become granular and do not slough off as readily as with enteroviruses. Often they remain fasten to the glass by a single process and flutter in the medium as the flask/tube is agitated during microscopic examination. The addition of the proteolytic enzyme can be used to enhance infectivity in cell culture (Spendlove and Schaffer 1965) . Cell culture assay methods have been concomitantly applied for quantification of ReoV infectivity such as most probable number assays (MPN) which derive MPN titers (i.e., virus titer) in replicates of cell monolayers inoculated with different equivalent volumes of a water concentrate (Lee and Jeong 2004; Sedmak et al. 2005) . Studies have also shown that multiple blind passages on BGM cells may increase the presence of virus particles for subsequent detection of ReoV RNA by RT-PCR or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (Muscillo et al. 2001) . Interestingly, these studies have also demonstrated that the simultaneous presence of ReoV and enteroviruses can have a masking effect by hindering enterovirus amplification and detection in environmental samples highly contaminated with ReoV (Carducci et al. 2002) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 282, "end": 299, "text": "Qiu et al.

Doses of UV light for ReoV type 1 (Lang) have been observed to be almost double of poliovirus type 1 for a 99.9 % reduction in titer (24 vs. 46 mW/sec/cm 2 ) (Harris et al. 1987) . McClain and Spendlove (1966) observed differences in UV light sensitivity of ReoV 1-3 at higher doses of UV, with ReoV type 3 being the most resistant. They also observed a nonlinear rate of inactivation and attributed to it experimentally to multiplicity of reactivation, i.e., two or more viruses infecting the same cell with different regions of damaged genome. They also observed that multiplicity of reactivation occurred between the different ReoV types, i.e., ReoV 1 could serve to compliment ReoV 2 infecting the same cell. It has also been suggested that the greater resistance of ReoV to UV light is due to its double-stranded segmented genome, a thicker protein coat than the single-stranded enteroviruses, and greater ability to aggregate (Harris et al. 1987) . In a study of resistance of naturally occurring coliphages and ReoV to UV light in secondary effluent, the rate of ReoV inactivation was found to be almost identical to F-specific coliphages (Nieuwstand et al. 1991) . Liu et al. (1971) reported that highly purified ReoV types 1-3 were more sensitive to chlorine in buffered water and Potomac River water than various types of adenovirus, poliovirus, echovirus, and Coxsackievirus. The most detailed studies on ReoV inactivation by disinfectants was conducted by Sharp et al. (1975) . They found that inactivation of ReoV and enteroviruses was highly dependent on the size and number of viral aggregates. The viruses could be made to aggregate and deaggregate by changing the pH, salt concentration, and the types of salts in solution (Floyd and Sharp 1977; 1978a; 1978b) . Their studies also suggested that the observed tailing effect during bromine disinfection was due to aggregates larger than 1,000 virions. These ''super sized'' aggregates were too rare to be seen under the electron microscope, but by sonication they could break some of these resulting in an increase in titer. They suggested that these ''super'' aggregates were formed in cell culture and in addition to aggregated virus might also contain cell debris. Another phenomenon observed was the ability of ReoV and poliovirus type 1 to form aggregates together (Floyd 1979) . Thus, dissimilar viruses could form aggregates. Since they found that 10 5 -10 6 virions were needed to form aggregates, they concluded this was not a significant factor in viral resistant in wastewater. However, with modern molecular methods such as qPCR for quantifying genome copies of viruses, concentrations of 10 5 -10 6 per mL of adenoviruses, Aichi viruses, and pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) are known to occur in wastewater ).
