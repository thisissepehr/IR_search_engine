            "text": "In vitro neutralizing antibodies have been often correlated with protection against Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) infection. We have reported previously that a single inoculation of sucrose-purified modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) encoding RVFV glycoproteins (rMVAGnGc) was sufficient to induce a protective immune response in mice after a lethal RVFV challenge. Protection was related to the presence of glycoprotein specific CD8+ cells, with a low-level detection of in vitro neutralizing antibodies. In this work we extended those observations aimed to explore the role of humoral responses after MVA vaccination and to study the contribution of each glycoprotein antigen to the protective efficacy. Thus, we tested the efficacy and immune responses in BALB/c mice of recombinant MVA viruses expressing either glycoprotein Gn (rMVAGn) or Gc (rMVAGc). In the absence of serum neutralizing antibodies, our data strongly suggest that protection of vaccinated mice upon the RVFV challenge can be achieved by the activation of cellular responses mainly directed against Gc epitopes. The involvement of cellular immunity was stressed by the fact that protection of mice was strain dependent. Furthermore, our data suggest that the rMVA based single dose vaccination elicits suboptimal humoral immune responses against Gn antigen since disease in mice was exacerbated upon virus challenge in the presence of rMVAGnGc or rMVAGn immune serum. Thus, Gc-specific cellular immunity could be an important component in the protection after the challenge observed in BALB/c mice, contributing to the elimination of infected cells reducing morbidity and mortality and counteracting the deleterious effect of a subneutralizing antibody immune response.",

            "text": "Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a mosquito-borne bunyavirus, is widely distributed in Sub-Saharan countries, Egypt and the Arabian Peninsula, causing disease in both humans and livestock [1] . RVFV is considered an emerging threat for non-endemic countries due to the movement of infected animals and/or translocation of infected mosquitoes [2, 3] . The ample range of RVFV competent mosquito vectors present in many areas of the Mediterranean basin suggests that RVF outbreaks in non-endemic areas could potentially end-up in the establishment of enzootic infection cycles [4] . Should this happen it would cause serious concern for both public and animal health. It is therefore desirable to develop control tools as well as enhance our knowledge about the immune mechanisms that correlate with the protection elicited by RVFV vaccines. The modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus has been widely used as a carrier of vaccine antigens due to its safety and immunogenicity profile [5] . The MVA vector is a highly attenuated version of a vaccinia virus strain that has lost around 30 kb of sequence upon passage in primary avian cells (CEF) so that many host range and immune-modulatory genes are absent or nonfunctional [6] . This restricts the replication of the virus in most mammalian cells. Besides, it has been demonstrated that MVA itself is very immunogenic (induces humoral responses and is an excellent inducer of T-cell responses). It has been used in human preclinical and clinical trials [7] and more recently it has also been evaluated for different animal diseases, including zoonotic diseases [8] .",

            "text": "In order to control RVF it is generally accepted that the induction of neutralizing antibodies is an important correlate of protection [9] . Therefore, the Gn and Gc glycoproteins are the main vaccine antigen targets since both glycoproteins are membrane proteins forming spikes on the surface of the virions that can be accessible to neutralizing antibodies [10] [11] [12] , precluding either internalization and/or nucleocapsid uncoating. Both glycoproteins are synthesized as a polyprotein precursor that becomes localized in Golgi membranes where they are glycosylated and cotranslationally processed by a yet unidentified cellular protease that releases one end of the membrane attachment sites, allowing both ectodomains to interact and the glycoproteins to acquire their final conformation on the surface of the virion [13, 14] . The structure of GnGc architecture has been recently elucidated indicating that Gn shields Gc in the viral particles avoiding to expose the Gc fusion loop to antibodies [15] and offers an hypothesis for the neutralizing mechanisms of protective antibodies [16] . Our previous works using recombinant MVA (rMVA) as vector vaccines expressing both glycoprotein antigens (rMVAGnGc) showed an intriguingly low level of in vitro neutralizing antibody induction upon single dose administration, particularly when compared to other similar rMVA vaccines encoding RNA virus glycoprotein antigens [17] . In our system, the lack of a humoral protective antiglycoprotein response was observed in both mouse models and disease natural hosts [18] . Particularly, for sheep no neutralizing antibody induction was demonstrated either after one or two serial rMVAGnGc vaccine doses, questioning the efficacy of this vaccine in this species [18] . The lack of neutralizing antibody induction could be related to the vector platform used in those experiments (MVA) since the same coding glycoproteins expressed by means of an adenovirus vector induced a potent set of neutralizing antibodies [19, 20] .",

Rather, the protection observed upon challenge was related to a strong T-cell response, which appeared more prominent against Gc epitopes. Intriguingly, the immune response elicited by the rMVA vaccine encoding both glycoproteins or glycoprotein Gn endowed the serum with the capacity to exacerbate disease when a serum:virus mixture was passively transferred to naive mice, as shown in experiments using either mouse or sheep immune sera obtained from rMVA vaccinated animals. It therefore appears that evoking a strong cellular response counteracts the failure in inducing protective humoral responses when an MVA vaccine is used. Conversely, the absence of an effective cell-mediated immune response may lead to disease exacerbation when subneutralizing antibody responses are elicited. These results warrant the optimization of our rMVA vaccines towards the induction of optimal humoral responses.",

For the generation of rMVA-Gn and rMVA-Gc, the recombination (shuttle) plasmid encoding an RVFV-MP12 GnGc tagged sequence (plasmid #1389 produced at the Viral Vector Core Facility (VVCF), Jenner Institute, Oxford) was used as a template of an inverse PCR reaction using specific 5 phosphorylated primers (Supplementary file, Table S1 ). After religation of the PCR fragments, two new shuttle vectors were generated, in which the Gn ectodomain (encoding amino acids Met131 to His580 of the translated polyprotein precursor) and a Gc including the C-terminal transmembrane-cytosolic tail (amino acids Cys690 to Ser1197) were placed under the control of the vaccinia p7.5 early/late promoter. The N-terminus of each recombinant polypeptide contained an in-frame fusion of the human tissue plasminogen activator leader sequence (tPA), known to enhance transgene expression and immunogenicity [21] . The C-terminus of each protein contained an H-2K d restricted CD8+ T cell epitope from Plasmodium berghei circumsporozoite protein (pb9) and an antiV5 monoclonal antibody recognition sequence. The plasmid for MVA construction also includes GFP as a reporter gene under the control of the vaccinia p11 late promoter. Both shuttle vectors were transfected into DF-1 cells (ATCC-CRL-12203) using lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), then infected with parental MVA and homologous recombination allowed the insertion of either Gn ectodomain (eGn) or Gc ORFs and the GFP marker gene at the TK locus of the MVA. Three consecutive rounds of green plaque purification were performed in order to obtain a pure preparation of each recombinant virus. The recombinant viruses (named rMVAGn and rMVAGc) were then further expanded in DF-1 cells. Semipurified, concentrated, virus preparations were obtained upon ultracentrifugation of infected cell extracts in a 36% sucrose cushion. The sucrose-purified virus fractions were titrated into DF-1 cells and stored at \u221280 \u2022 C until use.",

This ruled out the possibility of low level expression conditioning the immunity conferred by each vaccine. Expression of glycoproteins was also confirmed using antiGn or Gc specific antibodies [22] . The detecting signal was similar to that of RVFV MP12 infected BHK-21 cells. The size of Gn expressed by rMVAGn was in accordance with its theoretical mass (50.6 kDa) but slightly lower when expressed by rMVAGnGc. Gc expression was also in good agreement with the expected size and similar in size to the one expressed by RVFV infection, although a smaller truncated polypeptide was also evident using the antiGc or the antiV5 tag antibodies. Detection of the expressed antigens was performed also by immunofluorescence assay (IFA)of rMVA infected Vero cell monolayers with an antiV5 tag monoclonal antibody. The subcellular staining pattern of each glycoprotein was in good agreement with intracellular membrane trafficking as it has been described for both glycoproteins ( Figure 1B) . Gn expression was predominantly cytoplasmatic with no evident association with endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In contrast Gc interaction with ER structures was more obvious as shown by the colocalization with the ER marker calreticulin.

In this group at 11 dpi one mouse showed signs compatible to a delayed-onset neurological disease, dying at day 14 pi. In contrast, two of the mice vaccinated with rMVAGn showed earlier clinical disease dying at day 4 and 6 post challenge respectively. As expected, in the group of mice vaccinated with the rMVAGnGc construct the survival after challenge was 100%, with only one animal showing mild clinical signs between 3 and 4 dpi. In the mice from both control groups (either nonrecombinant MVA and unvaccinated) the mortality was 80% and 100% respectively with an earlier onset of disease in both groups. Differences in the survival rates observed for each group were statistically significant (\u03c7 2 = 09.503; df = 3; p = 0.023) when compared to the control MVA vaccine (Mantel-Cox log-rank test). Since the protective effect of our rMVAGnGc single dose vaccine relies mainly in the induction of specific CD8+T-cell responses [17] we questioned whether its efficacy in a different inbred mouse strain would be compromised. Thus we tested the protective ability of our rMVA vaccines in the context of a different genetic background by using the 129SvEv mouse model (H-2 b -haplotype). The sensitivity of this mouse strain to the RVFV challenge is higher than that of the H-2 d BALB/c strain (our unpublished data). Survival rates upon the RVFV challenge in the 129SvEv mice immunized with rMVAGnGc reached 80% with only one animal dying at 5 dpi. Contrarily, to what was observed in the BALB/c experiments, all of the 129SvEv mice that were vaccinated with rMVAGc or rMVAGn died upon challenge, with a slight delay in mortality in the rMVAGc group with respect to the MVA control group ( Figure 2B ).

As expected, levels of neutralizing antibodies in the serum from immunized BALB/c mice remained below the established detection threshold (1.3 log10, 1:20 serum dilution; Figure 3A) . Only two 129SvEv mice from the rMVAGnGc group showed titers slightly above the threshold limit (1.6 log10, serum dilution 1:40). The rest of mice, either vaccinated with rMVAGn or rMVAGc did not show titers above the detection limit in any of the mouse models used. Moreover, one animal from the MVA control group showed a VNT 50 titer of 1:20 indicating that the observed neutralization at this dilution could be unspecific. When a more stringent neutralization determination was applied (i.e., VNT 100 ), no single prechallenge serum showed neutralization in all microtiter wells (not shown). Upon RVFV 56/74 challenge, all surviving animals showed elevated neutralization titers reaching around 3 logs. Although these data could indicate a successful priming of the vaccines, a similar titer observed in a surviving mouse from the control group ruled out this possibility. Interestingly, the mean postchallenge neutralization titer of the rMVAGnGc vaccinated 129EvSv mice was slightly higher, in agreement with the two mice showing prechallenge neutralization titers over the sensitivity limit. In spite of the lack of a clear in vitro neutralization activity, both vaccines induced antibodies able to label RVFV-MP12 infected cells as shown by indirect immunofluorescence (Figure 3B ). In the case of the rMVAGc serum, antiGc antibodies developed later, since a clearly positive fluorescent signal on infected cells was only detected in serum collected 14 days post immunization ( Figure 3B ). However, none of these prechallenge sera was able to inmunoprecipitate metabolically labeled RVFV glycoproteins in infected cell extracts ( Figure 3C ).",

In this experiment individual sera from BALB/c mice collected 14 days after immunization with the different rMVA vaccines were pooled. The challenge virus dose (5 \u00d7 10 3 pfu/mouse) was preincubated in the presence of each serum pool (final serum dilution 1/14) for 30 min, prior to the inoculation of mice. All mice that received the challenge dose in the presence of RVFV convalescent serum survived with no clinical display nor significant weigh loss ( Figure 6A and Supplementary file, Figure S1 ). In contrast, all mice from the rMVAGn group and most of the mice inoculated with serum pooled from the rMVAGnGc or Ad5 control vaccinated groups died shortly after inoculation ( Figure 6A) . Interestingly, four out of five mice transferred with virus plus donor serum from rMVAGc or MVA control survived longer than mice from the rMVAGnGc group (\u03c7 2 = 12.11; df = 3; p = 0.0070) and eventually recovered from infection (Supplementary file, Figure S1 ). Accordingly with the survival data, mean viremia titers were more elevated in rMVAGn and rMVAGnGc groups when compared to rMVAGc or MVA control ( Figure 6B ), and the differences between means were statistically significant (p < 0.01, ANOVA test). Of note, the surviving mouse from the rMVAGnGc group had no conclusive viremia determination but it did not seroconverted (not shown), suggesting that this mouse was not efficiently infected. is observed relative to noninfected controls. Only samples allowing a clear cpe determination are included. Samples inducing a non cpe-like effect were excluded. When no evident cpe was observed an arbitrary value of 10 1 TCID 50 below the sensitivity limit (10 2 ) was assigned. Black lines represent means. Dotted line represents the sensitivity of the assay.

Again, the mortality rates were higher and occurred earlier in the rMVAGnGc group than in the control groups (not shown). These data were suggestive of an exacerbating disease effect induced by the serum from animals vaccinated with rMVAGnGc or rMVAGn vaccines. Intriguingly, the extended survival in the rMVA control group was totally unexpected, indicating that the protective effect in the mice was not related to the presence of antiRVFV specific antibodies. In order to check whether the enhanced pathogenic effect of the rMVAGnGc serum was not exclusive of the mouse immune serum, sheep serum pooled from a previous rMVAGnGc vaccination experiment [25] was also used in a similar transfer experiment. The results showed unequivocally an accelerated mortality, with statistical significance (\u03c7 2 = 7.740; df = 2; p = 0.0209) in the mice transferred with rMVAGnGc serum with respect to the serum from naive sheep ( Figure 6C ). Taken together the results observed suggest that the presence of serum anti Gn antibodies may trigger deleterious effects enhancing the infectivity of the virus inoculum.",

            "text": "We proposed previously that the protective ability of a recombinant MVA vaccine encoding GnGc antigens relied mostly in T-cell immune responses in the absence of a strong in vitro neutralizing antibody response [17] . Apparently, the lack of neutralizing responses could be due to the type of immunity elicited by the vector itself, since the same coding sequence, either expressed by plasmid DNA, subunit vaccine (Gn) or delivered by means of an adenovirus vector eventually elicited stronger neutralizing antibody responses in mice [17, 19, 26] . In this previous work several MHC class-I restricted peptides from the glycoprotein sequences were identified for their ability to stimulate the secretion of IFN\u03b3 by CD8-T cells [17] . Here, our data confirms that BALB/c mice can be also protected upon the RVFV challenge by rMVAGc and, to a lesser extent, by rMVAGn and that this protection can also be achieved in the absence of neutralizing antibodies. According to the role of a cell-mediated immune response, the protection was restricted to a specific genetic background, as shown by the lack of survival upon challenge of 129SvEv mice immunized with the same vaccines (rMVAGn or rMVAGc). The detection of IL-2 and IL-6 supports the induction of cellular responses since both cytokines play a role in T-cell survival and activation. Particularly, Gc-specific T-cell responses may act as a key component in the protection after challenge observed in the rMVA immunized mice, perhaps contributing to the efficient elimination of RVFV infected cells. Our data also point out that the simultaneous expression of both glycoproteins by the MVA vector is an essential requirement for the induction of a protective response in the 129SvEv mouse strain. At this point it could be interesting to explore further how the genetic background determines the efficacy of the immune response and how differences in susceptibility to RVFV challenge may account for the observed differences in efficacy.",

            "text": "One of the most striking findings in this work is the exacerbating effect of some rMVA immune serum in infectivity. This was somewhat unexpected but may help to explain our previous observations in experiments conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the rMVAGnGc vaccine in sheep [25] . An indirect measure of viral replication in the host is the induction of antibody responses to immunogenic epitopes. For RVFV, the most immunogenic epitopes lie in the viral nucleoprotein N. Therefore, detection of antiN serum antibodies reveals the existence of a productive RVFV infection in the host. Earlier antiN antibody detection was observed in the serum from sheep vaccinated with rMVAGnGc when compared to non-and mock vaccinated controls. In addition, the amount of viral RNA detected in blood was higher at early times upon infection than in controls, indicating faster virus replication. We could reproduce here similar results upon the passive transfer of both mouse and sheep serum. One explanation to these findings would be the induction of subneutralizing antibodies able to enhance rather than block virus replication. Antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) has been described in several viral systems, with more detail in flaviviral infections [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . In the case of RVFV it could be suggested that subneutralizing antiGn antibodies could bind to exposed Gn epitopes on the virus particle. In this scenario internalization of virus-antibody immune-complexes would be augmented in cells bearing complement or Fc receptors, increasing virus uptake and pathogenesis. This could explain the increased mortality of mice that were transferred with rMVAGnGc or rMVAGn serum:virus mixtures compared to that of rMVAGc or the MVA control. However, the protection observed in mice receiving the MVA control immune serum is puzzling. A plausible explanation could be that other nonantibody mediated humoral effectors provide some degree of protection although not sufficient to avoid deleterious effects of subneutralizing antibody responses. Thus, MVA or rMVAGc serum transfer would provide such antiviral effect while the transfer of rMVAGnGc or rMVAGn serum would enhance infectivity through subneutralizing antiGn antibodies. Both the classical and alternative pathways of the complement system can be activated upon viral infections and it has been shown that complement system plays an important role in poxvirus immunity [33] . On the other hand, deposition of complement proteins on the surface of enveloped virions enhances uptake by phagocytosis and potentially interferes with receptor interactions, virus entry, and uncoating [34] . Whether this hypothesis is or not true would deserve further experimentation. Nonetheless, it becomes clear that improving the quality of the antibody response of our MVA vaccines would render them more efficacious against a lethal RVFV challenge. Current work is underway to test the ability of novel MVA recombinants using different vector source and stronger promoter sequences for increasing antigen expression and enhancing proper processing of antigens.",
