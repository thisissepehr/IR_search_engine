            "text": "The 1970s and 1980s were the golden age of cytokines when the biochemical nature of several soluble mediators was clarified. Cellular immunologists then identified macrophage-derived mediators that activate lymphocytes (LAF, lymphocyte-activating factor) and lymphocyte-derived mediators that activate macrophages (MAF, macrophage-activating factor). These molecules are in the class of mediators defined as growth factors, which include hematopoietic growth factors (that now retain those names: G-CSF, GM-CSF, EPO), and interferons (described as antiviral factors in the late 1950s). One particularly active field was that of the research of soluble mediators that could kill tumor cells or boost anticancer defense. Along this line, earlier studies focused on a lymphocyte-derived cytotoxin termed lymphotoxin (LT), and led to the discovery of a serum factor capable of inducing hemorrhagic necrosis of tumors in vivo and killing of tumor cells in vitro. This factor was termed tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and shown to be mainly a macrophage product, as opposed to LT. In 1985 several groups reported the cloning of human and mouse TNF and the ability of recombinant TNF to induce hemorrhagic necrosis of tumors in mice. It would have not been easy, 15 yr ago, to predict that the main clinical application of the discovery and characterization of TNF would have consisted in the administration of anti-TNF molecules for the therapy of rheuma-MOLECULAR BIOTECHNOLOGY Volume 31, 2005 toid arthritis and Crohn's disease. In fact, TNF turned out to be a key pathogenic mediator with pleiotrophic activities, and its history and road, from immunity to inflammation, very similar to that of interleukin (IL)-1. Also unexpected is the fact that the characterization of the inflammatory action of TNF stemmed from studies on models of sepsis.",
