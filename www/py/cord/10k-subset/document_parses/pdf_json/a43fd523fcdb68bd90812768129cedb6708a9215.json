We estimated the potential impact of trends in diabetes prevalence upon mortality and the future burden of dementia and disability in England and Wales. Methods We used a probabilistic multi-state, open cohort Markov model to integrate observed trends in diabetes, cardiovascular disease and dementia to forecast the occurrence of disability and dementia up to the year 2060. Model input data were taken from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, Office for National Statistics vital data and published effect estimates for health-state transition probabilities. The baseline scenario corresponded to recent trends in obesity: a 26% increase in the number of people with diabetes by 2060. This scenario was evaluated against three alternative projected trends in diabetes: increases of 49%, 20% and 7%. Results Our results suggest that changes in the trend in diabetes prevalence will lead to changes in mortality and incidence of dementia and disability, which will become visible after 10-15 years. If the relative prevalence of diabetes increases 49% by 2060, expected additional deaths would be approximately 255,000 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 236,200), with 85,900 (71,500-101,600) cumulative additional cases of dementia and 104,900 (85,900-125,400) additional cases of disability. With a smaller relative increase in diabetes prevalence (7% increase by 2060), we estimated 222,200 (205,700-237,300) fewer deaths, and 77,000 (64,300-90,800) and 93,300 (76,700-111,400) fewer additional cases of dementia and disability, respectively, than the baseline case of a 26% increase in diabetes.

The structure of the model allowed us to take into account the risks between these conditions and competing risks of dying from cardiovascular and noncardiovascular causes. Diabetes increases the risk of dying, not only from CVD, but also from many other diseases, including several cancers. Given the declining population risk of CVD mortality in future years, the competing risk of non-CVDs is expected to become critical. Our model accounts for this by separating projections of future cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular risk of death, which represents a substantial improvement on previous methodologies [24, 26] . Specifically, we account for trends in CVD-and non-CVD mortality and incidence, trends in dementia incidence, competing risks between cardiovascular and noncardiovascular risk factors. Our methods also account for the increase in risk of both CVD and dementia caused by the time spent living with diabetes. IMPACT-BAM also models the time lag between newly developed diabetes and its complications. To our knowledge, there are no previous studies modelling the effect of prevention of diabetes on dementia and disability which also take into consideration the time needed to develop diabetes complications.

In addition, the DPM model (available on PHE official website) lacks information on any potential methodological limitations. Moreover, our approach to projecting the future distribution of the diabetes duration in the population does not account for increased risk of death due to longer duration of diabetes.

Moreover, as CVD mortality continues to decline, we expect a further shift in the burden of diabetes to non-cardiovascular complications. Contrary to some other diabetes complications, such as nephropathy or retinopathy, people with cognitive decline and dementia cannot be offered treatment to significantly slow down the progress of the disease.

The number of incident dementia cases is also expected to rise from approximately 142,000 (137,000-147,300) per year in 2015 to 208,500 (197,400-218,900) in 2045 and 203,700 (189,100-217,500) in 2060.This increase in the number of annual incident cases occurred despite a continuous decline in the incidence rates of dementia and disability. This suggests that the reason for the increasing number of projected new cases of dementia and disability is the projected ageing of the population, due to increasing longevity. The incidence of disability expressed per 1000 population aged \u226565 is forecasted to decrease from approximately 21.4 (95% UI 21.0-21.9) per 1000 personyears in 2015 to 17.1 (16.6-17.6) in 2045 and then 13.9(13.3-14.4)  in 2060. This decrease is also observed for dementia, with an expected fall from 13.6 (13.1-14.1) per 1000 person-years in 2015 to 12.4 (11.8-12.9) in 2045 and 10.4 (9.9-10.9) in 2060.The projected total mortality rate in people aged \u226565 is predicted to decrease by approximately 39% between 2015 and 2060, from 38.7 (95% UI 38.3-39.2) to 23.6 (22.7-25.0) per 1000 population.Comparison of three future scenariosEffect of diabetes trends on projected mortality For the most adverse scenario (A) we might expect about 79,700 (95% UI 72,500-86,000) additional deaths attributable to diabetes by 2045 (43.4 deaths per 100,000 population) and approximately 255,000 (236,000-272,200) additional deaths (79.5 per 100,000) by 2060(Table 3). This corresponds to approximately 650,000 (580,000-700,000) cumulative life years lost by 2045 and 2,570,000 (2,350,000-2,770,000) by 2060, which is 0.9% of life years lost for 2060 in comparison with the baseline scenario.In contrast, for scenario B we might expect about 18,900 (95% UI 17,200-20,400) fewer deaths due to diabetes by 2045 and 58,600 (54,300-62,600) by 2060 in comparison with the baseline scenario.

On the other hand, if there is a deceleration in the rate of increase of diabetes prevalence (scenario B), we might avoid approximately 24,400 (20,000-29,200) new cases of disability and 20,100 (16,800-23,700) new cases of dementia cumulatively by 2060.
