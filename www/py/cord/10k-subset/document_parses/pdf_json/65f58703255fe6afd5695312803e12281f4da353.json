We characterized the local phylodynamics of HIV-1 in DC using next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Viral samples from 68 participants from 2016 through 2017 were sequenced and paired with epidemiological data. Phylogenetic and network inferences, drug resistant mutations (DRMs), subtypes and HIV-1 diversity estimations were completed. Haplotypes were reconstructed to infer transmission clusters. Phylodynamic inferences based on the HIV-1 polymerase (pol) and envelope genes (env) were compared. Higher HIV-1 diversity (n.s.) was seen in men who have sex with men, heterosexual, and male participants in DC. 54.0% of the participants contained at least one DRM. The 40-49 year-olds showed the highest prevalence of DRMs (22.9%). Phylogenetic analysis of pol and env sequences grouped 31.9-33.8% of the participants into clusters. HIV-TRACE grouped 2.9-12.8% of participants when using consensus sequences and 9.0-64.2% when using haplotypes. NGS allowed us to characterize the local phylodynamics of HIV-1 in DC more broadly and accurately, given a better representation of its diversity and dynamics.

There were 340 newly diagnosed cases in DC in 2018, and the DC rate is five times higher than the national rate 3 .

Such rare mutations are particularly relevant in the context of the evolution of drug resistance, since they may facilitate viral adaptation leading to treatment failure 10,11 .

Viral populations may contain a pool of different variants that are resistant to different antiretroviral drugs 12,13 and also help the virus to evade the immune system 14 .

We performed in-depth phylodynamic profiling of HIV sequences from 171 PCR gene products that passed quality thresholds, including 62 PR/RT, 62 int, and 47 env amplicons. The subtyping analyses showed that all of the participants belonged to subtype B; therefore, subsequent analyses included data from all participants. Our participants were dispersed amongst and showed a star-like pattern with other DC HIV PR/RT sequences (see Supplementary Fig. S1 online) . The env(c) data showed higher nucleotide diversity (\u03c0) and Watterson genetic diversity (\u03b8) than pol(c) ( Table 2 ). Males had a higher diversity, though not significant, than females (haplotype diversity: PR/RT: p = 0.2039, int: p = 0.9571, env: p = 0.3404). Participants whose risk factor was IDU (n = 6) had 50% less diversity than those with MSM and HRH risk, though again not significant (haplotype diversity: PR/RT: p = 0.7323, int: p = 0.7861, env: p = 0.6560). Non-Hispanic black participants had a higher genetic diversity for the pol(c) gene than for the env(c) gene ( Table 2 ). The average haplotype diversity when calculated with the number of reconstructed haplotypes by PredictHaplo showed that env had more haplotype diversity compared to PRRT and int ( Table 3 ). The average number of haplotypes per participant was the same for PR/RT and int (2 haplotypes) and slightly higher for env (4) . Four of the six participants that had a higher number of haplotypes reconstructed (7-12 haplotypes in one or more gene regions) also had a higher average haplotype diversity estimate of 0.634 (range: 0.392-0.777), while the other two had a very low average haplotype diversity estimate (0.032, range: 0.027-0.038).

Transmission clusters were assessed by phylogenetic methods and HIV-TRACE, a genetic-distance based clustering method. Phylogenetic methods found support (>70% bootstrap or >0.95 posterior probability) for 33.8% of the sequences associated with six transmission clusters in pol(c) and for 31.9% of the sequences associated with seven clusters in env(c) (highlighted in Fig. 1 ). All of the clusters were comprised of two to three sequences, except one cluster in pol(c) which had twelve sequences. Ten of the twelve sequences in the large pol(c) cluster contained a DRM within RT. Furthermore, 11 of the 12 sequences in this large cluster were included on the same sequencing run; therefore, we were unable to undoubtfully discriminate between laboratory artifacts or batch effects and HIV infection to interpret this transmission cluster. However, there were other samples from that same sequencing run that did not cluster with these twelve sequences and formed a dyad cluster. The most common DRM was T215C, which does not reduce NRTI susceptibility, and was found in eight of the twelve sequences. HIV-TRACE grouped only a few sequences into two clusters for pol(c) (12.8%) and into a single cluster for env(c) (2.9%) (Fig. 2I ). More transmission clusters were estimated with the haplotypes reconstructed from PredictHaplo (Fig. 2II , Table 5 ). For PR, RT, and int (genes also used in past DC HIV studies 28, 29 ), 82.1% of our participants were incorporated into transmission clusters. Unique to our dataset was the use of envelope to predict transmission clusters; 35.8% of our participants were included in V1V2 and V3 transmission clusters. Haplotypes were not concatenated for this analysis, but little overlap of cluster composition was found between gene regions. Often one participant's haplotype would cluster with another participant in one gene region, but it would cluster with a different participant in a different gene region. Thus different gene regions displayed different transmission clusters that would not have been detected if one only analyzes a single gene. Clusters predicted in all gene regions were mainly composed of two participants (42 of the 55 total clusters). Likewise, the majority of the transmission clusters predicted by past DC HIV studies 28, 29 were comprised of two or three participants, regardless of the gene region, clustering estimation method, or haplotype/consensus construction approach.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1389, "end": 1392, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 3376, "end": 3379, "text": "28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 3380, "end": 3382, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 4249, "end": 4252, "text": "28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 4253, "end": 4255, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 454, "end": 483, "text": "Supplementary Fig. S1 online)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 591, "end": 598, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1064, "end": 1071, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1255, "end": 1262, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 2334, "end": 2340, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 3187, "end": 3195, "text": "(Fig. 2I", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 3293, "end": 3302, "text": "(Fig. 2II", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 3305, "end": 3312, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": "TABREF7"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Collectively, our study aimed to characterize the local and recent phylodynamics of a subset of DC Cohort participants from Washington, DC metro area living with HIV.
