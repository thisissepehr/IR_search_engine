In such cases the specific signs of infection seen in other patients are often missing (3) . When neutropenic patients become febrile, it is universally recommended that an empirical regimen of antibiotics active against gram-negative bacteria be started immediately (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . Such an approach is based on the assumption that most episodes of fever in the neutropenic patient are caused by bacterial infections. Studies show that the empirical administration of new, potent antibiotics has resulted in a reduction in mortality compared to previous studies (13) . However, these antibiotics are expensive, may interfere with diagnostic procedures and -most important-It has been demonstrated that the prophylactic administration of oral antibiotics for selective decontamination results in a marked reduction in the rate of serious infections with gram-negative microorganisms (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) . This marked decrease in the risk of fulminant infections should lead to a reappraisal of the classical approach to the management of fever in patients on selective decontamination, especially the administration of prolonged broad-spectrum antibiotics in the case of unexplained fever (24, 25) . In these patients application of a restrictive antibiotic policy may avoid the above-mentioned risks arising from standard empirical antibiotic regimens.",

Patients older than 15 years with a hematologic disorder who were admitted to the Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit or Hematology Department of University Hospital Leiden were prospectively studied when they became febrile during a period of severe neutropenia while receiving antibiotics for selective decontamination. Only patients with an expected duration of neutropenia of more than one week were included in the study. The study started on I May 1987 and ended on 1 May 1988. Fever was defined as an axiUary or oral temperature of 38 *C or higher on at least two readings taken four hours apart. Febrile reactions obviously caused by the infusion of blood or/blood components were excluded, Neutropenia was defined as a neutrophil count of less than 0.5 x 109/1. The end of a non-fatal febrile episode was indicated by temperatures below 38 \u00b0C without evidence of infection. A prophylactic selective decontamination regimen was given orally throughout the period of neutropenia, and consisted of 250 mg neomycin, 100 mg polymyxin B and 250 mg amphotericin B four times daily and 400 mg pipemidic acid twice daily. All patients were nursed in protective isolation. If patients were not able to swallow, 960 mg cotrimoxazole was administered intravenously twice daily to preserve the state of decontamination during that interval. Antibiotic prophylaxis was adjusted in accordance with the results of bacteriological surveillance which included regular culture of samples of skin and mucosa from different sites, as described previously (17) . Some patients on high-dose cytarabine-C therapy received benzylpenicillin intravenously for a two-week period following the end of chemotherapy to prevent streptococcal septicemia, as this appears to be a frequent and serious complication in these patients (26) .",

At the onset of fever a decision was made as to whether to initiate treatment or not; treatment was initiated if one of the following criteria applied: 1) Physical examination by the infectious diseases consultant (i.e, the investigator or one of his colleagues) revealed an acute deterioration of the patient's general condition, the presence of hypotension or chills, an abrupt rise in temperature of 2 *C or more, or signs of focal infection. Local signs of infection included oropharyngeal mucositis, redness, swelling and/or pain at the site of insertion or along the route of the subcutaneous tunnel of a central venous catheter, painful swelling in the perianal region, and signs of upper or lower respiratory tract infection. 2) Microbiological in-vestigations yielded a positive Gram stain and/or a positive culture of (a) blood (for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Corynebacterium spp. at least two sets of blood cultures had to be positive), (b) urine (except for concentrations < 103/ml of enteroeoeci, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium spp. or Candida spp), (c) sputum (except for normal pharyngeal bacterial flora), (d) material obtained by puncture. 3) Specific potential pathogenic microorganisms such Staphylococcus aureus, 13-hemolytic streptococci or gram-negative bacteria, were detected in surveillance cultures. 4) X-ray studies of the chest and sinuses showed abnormalities suggestive of infection. Culture results were not usually available at the onset of fever except in the case of surveillance cultures taken prior to the febrile episode. For the purposes of this study, an infection was defined as a disease caused by a bacterial or fungal pathogen. If .an infection was judged likely on the basis of the above criteria, drugs for antimicrobial therapy were chosen taking into account previous antibiotic therapy and the following requirements: 1) Initial antibiotic treatment had to be specific when examination pointed to a focal infection o1\" a specific pathogen (e.g. penicillin for pharyngitis, vancomycin for infected site of entry of i.v. catheter) and the general condition did not warrant the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. 2) In the absence of evidence of the nature and location of the infection, standard empirical treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics including gentamicin and cefamandole had to be started. 3) As soon as the pathogen was identified and susceptibility tests were completed, antibiotic therapy was adjusted to agents with specific activity against the pathogen. Antibiotics were continued until the neutrophil count rose above 0.5 x 109/1 and the signs of infection disappeared. Antibiotic therapy was defined as inappropriate when susceptibility tests showed resistance to the agents used. Antibiotic therapy was considered to lack efficacy if there was no clinical response after 48 to 96 hours, despite susceptibility of the pathogen isolated; therapy was changed either to more potent antibiotics (e.g. penicillin replacing cefamandole for streptococcal septicemia) oz to broad-spectrum antibiotics or antifungal agents if the patient's condition so demanded. If cultures remained negative and clinical evidence of a serious infection was lacking 72 to 96 hours after initiation of therapy, whether empirical or specific, the systemic antibiotics were discontinued even if fever persisted and the patient kept under close surveillance. If an infection was considered unlikely at the onset of fever, antibiotics were withheld and the patient re-examined daily to reevaluate the need for treatment. The outcome of all febrile episodes was evaluated in relation to the antibiotic treatment and pathogens isolated. Mortality during or within two weeks after the end of the febrile episode was taken as the primary endpoint for determining the success of the treatment. Follow-up evaluation in the case of survival was made four weeks after the end of the febrile episode.",

They do not recommend adaptation of treatment to culture results with narrowing of the antibiotic spectrum. With respect to the duration of systemic broad-Spectrum antibiotic therapy, Pizzo (12) argues for continuing treatment until neutropenia resolves. The guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America allow discontinuation of (broad-Spectrum) antibiotics only in two instances: (a) if neutropenia continues and the patient is clinically well, after a total of five to seven afebrile days, and (b) if the neutrophil count rises over 0.5 x 109/1 and-antibiotics have been given for a total of seven days (11) . Unfortunately, in both sets of US guidelines the benefits of prophylactic administration of oral antibiotics for selective decontamination are not taken into consideration. In neutropenic patients on selective decontamination febrile episodes still occur and remain unexplained in about 50 %. As there is a marked reduction in the rate of gram-negative infections the organism spectrum has changed with a predominance of gram-positive infections. Whether the use of selective decontamination allows more restrictive systemic antibiotic therapy has not yet been established, although it was suggested by Joshi et al. (25) . In many European centers nowadays patients are receiving oral prophylaxis and there may therefore be a need for more Specific guidelines.",

As these patients were at risk for fulminating infections, it is the outcome of the episodes in terms of survival which should justify this approach, not just whether infections were treated appropiately (27) .

This recommendation is based on the observation that secondary infections can occur in the course of prolonged neutropenia due to continuing colonization with potentially pathogenic micro-organisms (11, 12, 24, 28, 29) . Continuation of initial broad-spectrum therapy should therefore be considered as continuous systemic prophylaxis until the neutrophil count rises and the danger of endogenous infections is over (8, 10) . However, after selective decontamination there is no need for such systemic prophylaxis (14, 17, 20) . Instead of continuing the broad-spectrum antibiotics, we therefore gave specific narrowspectrum antibiotics as soon as indicated by clinical or microbiological data. This resulted in the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics to only 6 of the 34 (18 %) patients who received \u2022 therapy for a longer period of time (median 14 days), which represents 8 % of the total number of episodes.

In cases of presumed penicillin resistance we would recommend administration of vancomycin or teicoplanin. In five of the ten episodes of streptococcal septicemia in our study, cotrimoxazole was given prophylactically and thus failed to prevent this disease. Moreover, the use of cotrimoxazole as well as quinolones has been recognized as a predisposing factor (32) . Because of the fulminant character of the disease immediate institution of appropriate therapy is required. However, commonly recommended regimens using third generation cephalosporins are not the most appropriate for these streptococci (33) .

On the contrary, some febrile episodes resolved spontaneously without any antibiotic therapy and others resolved after only a few days of antibiotic therapy. Whether these febrile episodes were associated with an obscure infection cannot be answered with certainty, but apparently recovery was possible without a full course of antibiotic therapy. In addition, as a result of the withholding of or early discontinuation of antibiotics, the etiology of 75 % of all unconfirmed infections could be presumed or established. This is a very high percentage compared to figures in other studies (7, 8) . A large proportion of febrile episodes appeared to be drug-related. Neutropenic cancer patients are prone to such reactions, partly because of the nature of the treatments they receive (cytostatics, allopurinol, antibiotics, blood and serum components) and perhaps also because of their altered immunological status. In view of this finding, it is important to warn against overtreatment with antibiotics, especially in patients receiving cytokines and hematopoietic growth factors, as they frequently induce fever (36).",

Such careful and continuous supervision to determine when antibiotics could be withheld is not available at all centers and the impact of this information could have an adverse effect in settings where a more casual approach is taken to the patient's fever. Therefore, we cannot recommend withholding antibiotics at the time of initial fever in every clinical setting. As a general rule, it would be wise to make decisions about continuation or adjustment of antibiotic therapy once the results of clinical examinations, radiography and microbiological ~nvestigations are available. On the basis of our findings we therefore recommend the following guidelines for the antibiotic treatment of selectively decontaminated neutropenic patients with fever: (a) discontinue systemic antibiotics after three to five clays if infection has not been demonstrated or is doubtful; (b) adjust antibiotic therapy, with a narrower antibiotic spectrum ac-Cording to the culture results; and (c) consider empirical antifungal therapy if fever persists for more than five to seven days. Because of the possibility of rapid deterioration of the patient in case of bacteremia, it is essential in all situations that repeated frequent evaluation of the patient's condition be continued until the bone marrow has recovered. Our study demonstrates that with an intensified patient-oriented approach many neutropenic patients can be spared the potential complications of unnecessary prolonged broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy. Because our study was not controlled it would be important to see whether our results could be confirmed in a controlled study which compares the conventional Strategy of empirical continuous broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with our strategy of restricted Use of systemic antibiotics.",

A final diagnosis of infection could be made in 26 of the 43 episodes (60.5 %). Twenty of these 26 episodes were treated appropriately from the onset of therapy, and 6 were not.In 34 episodes an infection was judged unlikely at the onset of fever, and antibiotics were withheld although the temperature (median 38.7 \u00b0C, range 38 \u00b0C -39.9 \u00b0C) was comparable to that of the other subset (Figure t). In 11 (32.4 %) of these 34 episodes a final diagnosis of infection could be established. This percentage differs significantly from that found for the other subset (32.4 % versus 60.5 %, p < 0.02 according to the Chi-square test). In a total of 15 episodes no antibiotics were given at all despite high maximum temperatures (median 39.0 \u00b0C, range 38.6 o _ 39.8 \u00b0C). Extensive and frequent examinations did not provide any evidence of a bacterial or fungal infection during these 15 episodes. Later observations and microbiological investigations led to the delayed initiation of antibiotic therapy in 19 episodes. The delay in administration of antibiotics varied between 1 and 4 days (median 2.5 days). Infection was confirmed in 11 of the 19 episodes. The initial therapy in 8 of these 11 confirmed infections was appropriate (Figure 1).",
