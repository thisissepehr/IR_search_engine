However, because of the computational resources they require for running multiple scenarios, they may not be effective in realtime decision exercising for pandemic planning. To overcome the limitations of previous models, we designed a compartmental model that generates insights about the implementation of mitigation policies in local communities and the model is also easy to use in real-time exercises for pandemic decision making. The presented model in this paper also differs from other compartmental models, because it does not model the interventions with population dynamics in one compartmental model, but rather it creates several basic Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (S-E-I-R) models running in parallel for different subpopulations generated by the policy implementation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 147, "end": 163, "text": "Das et al (2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 585, "end": 606, "text": "Ferguson et al (2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Literature review"}, {"text": "Public universities have large student and staff populations with significant social contact within institutional boundaries.

We then formulate a compartmental S-E-I-R model for all subpopulations.

However, these students are affected by the policies such as suspending university operations, closing the campus, as well as isolation of the infected individuals on campus. On the other hand, residential students are directly affected by the policies related to dorms, such as evacuating the dorms and isolation of infectious individuals on campus.

Essential personnel provide necessary basic services on campus, while non-essential personnel are assumed to be evacuated with the evacuation plan. From the strategic planning viewpoint, some of the most critical questions are: (1) when to suspend the university operations, including human resource management, research activities and residential life; and (2) how to maintain academic continuity and resume university operations.

In addition, there is a high probability that nonresidential students will request medical assistance from the university health services. University health services have to direct the students and minimize the severity of the disease. According to the university preparedness plan, all well students will be housed in one location on campus to centralize essential services. In addition to managing essential services for well students who are remaining on campus, the university plan includes an action plan for treating infected students. The sick students will be transferred to a temporary infirmary established in one of the dorms. The main inspection and control locations for the students will be the triage points at certain locations on the campus.

The effectiveness of an applied policy is measured by the number of mortalities and by the total number of infected people. We compare the effectiveness of the applied policies based on the base run (without any nonpharmaceutical intervention) for the decisions of applying social distancing and isolation at various times on campus. The parameters related to disease characteristics are set to fixed values at the beginning of the simulations and they are obtained from the literature (Longini et al, 2004; Chowell et al, 2006; Mniszewski et al, 2008) . In our simulation model, we assume an infected mortality rate of 2% for the university community, an incubation period of 2 days and an infection period of 3.5 days. Because these parameters are unlikely to change depending on policies implemented by the university, they are considered as uncontrollable parameters. We determine the contact rates of individuals based on our observations. Because we observe higher contacts for residence hall students, the average contact rate for the commuting students is assumed to be 60 people/day and 75 people/day for the residence hall students. The infection rate of the model is fixed to 1.5%, which is defined as the rate of getting infected given a contact with an infectious person. The model parameters for our base run for two main subpopulations are given in Table 2 . After determining the system parameters, we first run the simulation (base run) model, without applying any intervention policies. The initial population numbers for each subpopulation are obtained from the university's data respiratory; we have 47 300 commuting students and 7700 residential students. The disease dynamics starts with an introduction of an asymptomatic infected person to the community on 23 September. The results of the simulation for commuting students and residence hall students are presented in Figure 3 . These results show that without any interventions, the expected infection rate is 39.17% and the mortality rate is 0.98% for the total student population (1.95% mortality in residential students and 0.81% mortality in commuting students). These two results show that the disease has a high potential to affect almost half of the university population. For the policy makers, it is clear that they should activate their preparedness plan to better manage the disease for the university population. However, the question of when to activate this plan is of major importance. Since any cancellation of university operations will cause serious financial and managerial disruption to the university, the timing of suspension of operations should be decided carefully and optimally in terms of reducing the financial burden while minimizing the mortality (number of deaths) and morbidity (number of infected people) on campus.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 623, "end": 644, "text": "(Longini et al, 2004;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 645, "end": 665, "text": "Chowell et al, 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 666, "end": 689, "text": "Mniszewski et al, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1501, "end": 1508, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 2030, "end": 2038, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Simulation results and policy analysis"}, {"text": "In addition to mortality and morbidity results from the base run, we can see that, the disease is getting to its peak point on 25 October (32 days after the first case) for the commuting students; however, it gets to peak point for the residence hall students on 20 October (27 days after the first case). This can only be explained by the input parameter, contact rate, which is the only different factor in the model for these subpopulations and it is a controllable parameter. This result also shows that the decision makers have less time for taking actions to reduce the mortalities in the dorms because it reaches to its peak point in a shorter time in residence halls. Moreover, since the contact rate is the only different parameter between these two subpopulations and because it is a highly uncertain parameter, it has a good possibility of affecting the implementation of the policies. Because of this reason, we performed a sensitivity analysis on the contact rate for both commuting students and residence hall students in the next section. If university decision makers decide to suspend university operations based on the events occurring in the world, country and state, the simulation results show that the severity of the disease can be reduced significantly. However, the date of suspending university operations will generate different results on the number of infected people and number of deaths on campus. These students will be forced to relocate to another dorm to centralize services. Owing to increased contact rate in dorms, the total number of students who are exposed and infected on campus will still remain high.

On the other hand the deaths on campus and infected students on campus have the worst effectiveness values. Thus, another interesting conclusion that we make from this calculation is that decision makers should not wait for the first death on campus since it has the lowest effectiveness value. In other words they should consider the mortalities occurring outside the university in order to have a better policy for protecting university population. We also compare the school days lost with suspending university operations at different times with the total number of infected students. Since late closures will result in a higher number of infections, decision makers may want to balance cost of university closure with the number of infections on campus. Thus, for the considered dates of closure we compare the number of lost days with the number of infected students in Figure 5 .

From these analysis presented in Figure 7 we can conclude that the incubation period also plays a major role on the mortalities of commuting students, since the variability on this parameter can cause a big difference in mortality values that is almost 60 people in all of the analyses, thus the uncertainty on the incubation period may have a big impact on the policies to reduce the total number of deaths in commuting students. This is because we assume exposed individuals are also infectious but asymptomatic and incubation period is the time for the people to be active in the community and spread the disease in the community.

We also evaluate the duration of dorm evacuations with five index cases in the dorms for both cases of having evacuation on 1 October and 15 October.

Therefore, the effectiveness of agent-based models to simulate preparedness plans in support of real-time decisions with real-time inputs is limited (Bhandari et al, 2007) . In addition, in agent-based models it is hard to get an insight on the mathematical structure of the disease spread and interventions, whereas in compartmental models it is easy to perform sensitivity analysis on model parameters and develop theoretical insights (Bobashev et al, 2007) .

The simulation results show that even during a mild pandemic, the decision to suspend university operations is critical.

Our sensitivity analyses demonstrate that some of the parameters of the influenza spread model have more impact on the outcomes of the simulations; thus, for developing the appropriate mitigation policies these policy makers should pay special attention to these parameters. We conclude that contact rate has high importance in disease spread, and disease spread can be controlled by disease mitigation policies when appropriate actions are taken at the appropriate time. Thus, the decision makers should consider minimizing the contact rate and adjust their plans when applying several mitigation policies to their communities. In addition, uncertain and uncontrollable disease parameters have significant impact on the disease spread since it is the time for the exposed people to be active in the community and spread the disease to their contacts.
