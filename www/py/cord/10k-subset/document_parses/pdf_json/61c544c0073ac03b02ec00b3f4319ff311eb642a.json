The rapid global spread of the new influenza A/H1N1 virus resulted in the first influenza pandemic in 40 years. 1 Two therapies are currently licensed to treat influenza infections: the M2 ion channel blocking adamantane drugs (amantadine and rimantadine) and the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir). Pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus (pH1N1) crossed into humans carrying a well-characterized amantadine-resistance mutation, S31N, within the M2 ion channel protein, rendering the adamantane class of antiviral drug ineffective against the virus. Initial isolates were susceptible to NA inhibitors, including oseltamivir and consequently this drug was used extensively in the treatment and prophylaxis of pandemic influenza. 2 Oseltamivir resistance emerged infrequently in pH1N1 2009 influenza viruses. 3, 4 In contrast, seasonal H1N1 influenza viruses from the 2007-08 season onwards were predominantly resistant to oseltamivir with resistance conferred by the H275Y mutation in the viral NA. 5 Traditionally, the H275Y mutation was associated with compromised viral fitness amongst H1N1 isolates. 6 However, isolates from the 2007 -08 season with this mutation suffered no attenuation. 7 It is likely that certain other sequence variations, such as the D344N (N1 numbering) change found within the NA gene of oseltamivir-resistant viruses from the 2007-08 season, counteract the decrease in enzyme function that H275Y confers. 8, 9 Residue 344 is tyrosine in most avian influenza NA genes but mutated to asparagine in two N1 viruses, which crossed from birds into mammals shortly thereafter (the 1918 pandemic virus and the Eurasian lineage swine H1N1 viruses). 10 During circulation in humans, an aspartic acid at residue 344 was eventually selected in seasonal H1N1 viruses. Mutation back to asparagine occurred in circulating human H1N1 viruses prior to the 2007 season and was associated with increased NA activity. 9 The NA enzyme of pH1N1 virus is derived from a Eurasian lineage H1N1 swine virus, and harbours asparagine at residue 344. This suggested that it may tolerate mutations such as H275Y that would concomitantly decrease NA activity and confer oseltamivir resistance.

Subtle decreases in NA activity or cell surface expression may have more profound consequences in the airway than in monoculture. To probe this, we tested the NA activity of the mutated virus in assays that presented large sialylated substrates: in a red cell elution assay we detected a 4-fold compromise in the ability of the virus with H275Y mutation to mediate desialylation of chicken erythrocytes, although the biological significance of this assay is not entirely clear.

In a hospital setting there have been reports that suggest that patient-to-patient transmission of drug-resistant virus has occurred amongst immunocompromised individuals. 16 Hamelin et al. 17 showed that oseltamivir-resistant pH1N1 virus was equally virulent as its wild-type counterpart in mice and ferrets and did transmit to co-housed animals, though they did not assess droplet transmission. Seibert et al. 18 used guinea pigs and ferrets in both contact and droplet transmission studies and concluded that the drug-resistant mutant could potentially circulate in the community. However, a detailed analysis of their data reveals that for one of the viruses they tested, there was a 2 day delay in transmission to half the contact-exposed guinea pigs and for the other strain of pH1N1 there was a reduction in droplet transmission to 88% rather than 100% of exposed sentinels. The ferret experiments were conducted with n\u00bc 1 so it is difficult to be sure of their significance. Similarly, in the manuscript from Kiso et al., 19 the conclusion is again that the H275Y mutant transmits through the air between ferrets, but there is a 2 day delay in transmission of one of the mutant strains of virus studied. Conversely, Duan et al. 20 found that the drug-resistant virus did not transmit between ferrets by the respiratory droplet route and that in co-infected animals, the wild-type virus outgrew the resistant mutant and was uniquely transmitted to contact animals. Thus, the current picture from animal experiments is confused and discrepant. This might be partly due to the use of different strains of pH1N1 virus as well as different experimental protocols used by the various investigators. Anecdotal evidence from the clinic shows that, in most instances, contemporary drug-resistant variants of pH1N1 were replaced by drug-susceptible variants when the selective pressure of oseltamivir was removed, suggesting that wild-type isolates are fitter in vivo in humans. 21 Whether the subtle fitness deficit reported here for one particular strain of drug-resistant mutant pH1N1 virus explains the epidemiological observation that mutant virus has not circulated through the community is not clear, since many other factors including heterogeneous mixing of populations and stochastic effects may influence whether a particular virus mutant predominates. Nonetheless the virus competition assay conducted in HAE cultured cells described here offers an alternative biologically relevant model as a useful adjunct to animal studies and this system may more accurately reflect the environment in which virus replicates in otherwise healthy humans. Information from a variety of model systems should be combined to guide the appropriate use of oseltamivir. Such knowledge clearly needs to be revised specifically for each novel influenza virus that emerges either as a seasonal strain by drift or as a pandemic virus by antigenic shift.

After 72 h, virus released from the cells was collected, RNA extracted and the NA gene amplified by RT-PCR. PCR products were then sequenced. The sequence chromatogram shows the region spanning codon 275 in which a C nucleotide results in the wild-type 275H amino acid and a T nucleotide results in the drug-resistant 275Y genotype. The experiment was performed in triplicate and results from an individual well are displayed. To quantify these results, the supernatants were then subjected to pyrosequencing analysis to determine the abundance of each NA phenotype in the mixture. The percentage genotype measured by pyrosequencing for each of three individual wells is shown along with the mean.(a) Virus released from MDCK cells infected with a 50: 50 mixture of 275H and 275Y virus.
