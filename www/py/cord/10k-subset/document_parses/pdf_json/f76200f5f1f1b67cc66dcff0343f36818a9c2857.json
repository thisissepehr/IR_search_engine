            "text": "The acute and chronic effects of mouse hepatitis virus type 3 on the microcirculation of the liver in both semisusceptible C3HeBFeJ and fully resistant A/J mice were studied. In the C3HeBFeJ mice, abnormalities of microcirculatory flow were noted as early as 12 h r after infection and by 24 hr, localized avascular foci appeared. Disturbances were characterized by granular blood flow, sinueoidal microthrombi, distortion of sinusoids by edematous hepatocytes and necrotic lesions. Following the acute infection, Day 10, two patterns of chronic disease were observed. Eighty percent of the mice developed chronic granulomatous hepatitis whereas in the remaining 20% a more severe chronic aggressive hepatitis was observed which was characterized by ongoing hepatocellular necrosis and a marked mononuclear cell infiltrate. In both cases, in vivo microcirculatory abnormalities were found predominantly around visible lesions. Onset of the microcirculatory abnormalities was found to be concomitant with a rise in monocyte related procoagulant activity. Procoagulant activity rose acutely and remained elevated throughout the chronic phase but was higher in animals with severe disease. In contrast to the above, normal blood flow and histology were seen in the resistant A/J mice at all times following infection, and procoagulant activity remained at basal levels despite active viral replication as demonstrated by immunofluorescence studies and recovery of infectious virus. These observations suggest a role for monocyte procoagulant activity in the development of microcirculatory abnormalities following mouse hepatitis virus type 3 infection which may be important in the pathogenesis of the disease.",

In contrast, at 24 hr, the livers from C3HeBIFeJ mice had focal necrotic lesions consisting of acidophilic degenerating hepatocytes and nuclear debris with a sparse inflammatory infiltrate ( Figure 2A ). By 3 days postinfection, these early lesions became larger, more numerous and were associated with an infiltrate of pyknotic polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( Figure 2C ). At 5 days, confluent necrosis was evident in some sections ( Figure 3A ). By 7 to 10 days, the lesions were densely infiltrated with intact mononuclear cells, and the adjoining liver parenchyma underwent intense hepatocyte regeneration as evidenced by many mitotic figures ( Figure  4A ). Following the acute phase of the disease (Day lo), two patterns of chronic disease were observed. The first was characterized by the appearance of epithelioid cells with large pale nuclei and pale granular cytoplasm. These appeared within the foci of necrosis by 11 days postinfection, and by Day 15, most remaining lesions were organized into granulomas consisting of centralized epit helioid cells surrounded by mononuclear cells ( of disease was observed in approximately 20% of mice. These animals developed an aggressive form of hepatitis characterized by persistent necrotic foci with a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate, largely mononuclear, a severe terminal portal venule vasculitis and focal hepatocellular dropout ( Figure 6A ). Both of these groups of animals died within 6 to 9 months of the infection, a marked reduction from the normal 24 to 30 months.",

Mononuclear cells from A/J and C3HeBFeJ mice which had been injected with 100 pl of DMEM as controls had a basal surface PCA of 20 mU per 10\" PBMs. Following infection, there was no increase in PCA in PBMs from fully resistant A/J mice. In C:3HeB/FeJ mice, there was a greater than 10-fold increase in viable PCA by 12 hr which reached a maximum 40-fold increase over baseline at Day 4. This elevated PCA persisted for the subsequent 3 to 4 months with minor fluctuations in activity. The values of total PCA (obtained from disrupted cellular homogenates) were approximately twice those expressed at the cell surface (viable), and both activities followed parallel patterns. In order to examine the PCA response of individual mice, splenic mononuclear cells were harvested from C3HeB/FeJ mice and assayed for total content PCA ( Table 1) . Early in the course of the infection, all animals had markedly elevated PCA corresponding with the severe histologic and microcirculatory disturbances. At Days 10 to 14, two divergent patterns of PCA were observed. Although in both strains, the PCA remained elevated, animals that developed severe hepatitis (Type 1) maintained the high levels of PCA found during the acute phase of the disease whereas animals that developed chronic granulomatous hepatitis (Type 2) had PCA elevations at 5 to 10 times background but only 25 to 30% of the PCA observed in Type 1 animals. No increase in total PCA was found in PBMs or splenic macrophages from A/J mice over initial basal values.",

Blood flowed from the terminal portal venules, with occasional bursts of arteriolar flow, into the proximal sinusoids. The blood could be followed as it drained into terminal hepatic venules. Liver cell cords 1 to 2 cells wide separated the sinusoids. At 12 hr postinfection in C3HeBFeJ mice, the velocity of blood flow in the terminal hepatic vessels was slowed, however, the architecture of the parenchyma was normal. Small avascular, pale-colored parenchymal lesions, spanning 2 to 3 sinusoids appeared by 24 hr ( Figure 2B ). Localized granular blood flow, caused by reduced velocity of clumped erythrocytes, was prominent in dilated sinusoids which shunted blood around the lesions. Most of the lesions were found in zone 1 (periportal) of the simple liver acinus with normal intervening parenchyma. At 48 hr, diffuse granular flow occurred in the microcirculation, and sinusoidal microthrombi could be seen ( Figure 2D) . By 3 to 4 days, the parenchymal lesions were more numerous and larger, spanning as much as a full acinus. Sinusoidal flow was disrupted by microthrombi and edematous hepatocytes, and many sinusoids were difated with large pools of stagnant blood. At 5 days, parenchymal lesions had coalesced with widespread hepatic necrosis and severe parenchymal edema ( Figure 3B ). By Days 7 to 10, the diffuse flow abnormality had resolved and many lesions demonstrated dark hemorrhagic centers ( Figure 4B ). At Day 11, small pale and more sharply circumscribed lesions were noted ( Figure  4D ). By Day 15, the lesions were further condensed and contained occasional patches of a yellow-green stained pigment. From Day 21 to 2 months, avascular foci of heaped-up tissue were scattered throughout the liver while the intervening parenchyma exhibited normal architecture and sinusoidal blood flow. Histological examination of serial sections showed these lesions to be giant cell granulomas ( Figure 5B ). In the animals that developed granulomatous hepatitis, in uiuo microcirculatory flow abnormalities were confined to the sinusoids surrounding the granulomatous lesions. This consisted largely of granular blood flow at the periphery of the granuloma, and no blood flow was observed through the granuloma itself. Histologic examination demonstrated large numbers of mononuclear cells in the sinusoids adjacent to the lesions. In approximately 20% of C3H/ eBFeJ mice, marked localized abnormalities of the liver microcirculation correlated histologically with foci of aggressive hepatitis ( Figure 6B ). These foci were composed of a central avascular core which was surrounded by pale edematous hepatocytes containing dilated and disorganized sinusoids with slow or absent blood flow. Subsequent histologic analysis of these lesions which had been studied in uiuo demonstrated large areas of necrosis with a marked predominantly mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate ( Figure 6A ).",

A number of immune effector networks have been studied in the model of murine hepatitis virus infection; however, to date, none of these have shown good correlation with the strain dependence of disease susceptibility (15, 16) . In this paper, we present data that associate the spontaneous expression of monocyte PCA with acute and chronic liver inflammation in MHV-3-induced hepatitis. This relationship emphasizes the possible role of the coagulation cascade in the disturbances of the microcirculation that enhance liver cell necrosis. Activation of the coagulation system is a common feature of inflammation (17) (18) (19) (20) . Activated coagulation proteins serve as mediators of the inflammatory response by in turn recruiting the complement, kallikrein-kinin and fibrinolytic systems (20) . Furthermore thrombin and its activation fragment 1.2 directly elicit chemotaxis in monocytes (21) . It has been known for several years that leukocytes express a number of PCAs following stimulation both in uitro and in uiuo (20, 22) . The cellular source of this activity is the monocyte/macrophage but T lymphocytes and/or their products are necessary for the induction of these procoagulant monokines (22) . The coagulation cascade may be activated at local sites of inflammation by the procoagulant products of infiltrating leukocytes resulting in amplification of the inflammatory response with increased tissue injury.",

In the C3HeB/FeJ mice, a constant proportion (50%) of PCA was expressed at the cell surface, consistent with the physiologic importance of PCA in situ. During the early stage of the infection, splenic macrophage PCA did not discriminate between those mice that develop chronic aggressive hepatitis or chronic granulomatous hepatitis. Only by Day 10 could distinct patterns of PCA response be identified, and these correlated with the severity of the histologic lesion ( Table   1 ). As the mice studied are inbred strains, it is apparent that factors other than genetic are involved in the evolution of the immune-inflammatory process. Other investigators have shown that diet, age, sex, stress and temperature affect immune responses to infectious processes (23). However, in studies using recombinant inbred strains of mice, we have shown that PCA and susceptibility/resistance to MHV-3 infection are genetically linked and are controlled by two independent non-H-2linked genetic loci (Dindzans, V. et al., Hepatology 1984; 4: 1053, Abstract). Determinations of P-glucuronidase, 5'nucleotidase and elastase in macrophages from MHV-3 infected and control animals did not correlate with susceptibility to infection and resultant hepatitis (24) and thus, monocyte PCA is not simply a nonspecific marker of inflammation.",

These include: hypotension, neurally mediated vasoconstriction and vasodilation, humoral mediators (histamine, bradykinin) of vasodilation, hemoconcentration due to capillary permeability in-creases and changes in the surface charge of erythrocytes due to fibrin adsorption. Studies using fluorescent-labeled proteins during the acute phase of ally1 formate hepatitis revealed increased sinusoidal permeability within 10 min of administration of the toxin, coincident with the appearance of granular flow (6) . Similar abnormalities were detected in MHV-3-infected C3HeB/FeJ mice, suggesting similar pathophysiological mechanisms may be operative. In the acute phase of MHV-3 infection, viral antigens were diffusely deposited in the liver, and extensive microcirculatory disturbances were observed. In contrast, during the chronic phase, viral antigens were localized in focal deposits. Thus, continued specific stimulation of PCA in the chronic phase may result in localized microcirculatory disturbances confined to the areas of antigen deposition. Since it is known that PCA directly correlates with in vitro and in uivo measures of delayed cutaneous h-ypersensitivity (231, it is conceivable that PCA exerts its influence through both cellular and humoral immune mechanisms. This could occur by the production of lymphokines and/or the recruitment of activated T cells macrophages and NK cells into the chronically affected area. Finally, since PCA is a potent serine protease, it may have effects through its proteolytic action on substrates other than prothrombin.",

We postulate that the earliest derangement in hepatic physiology during MHV-3 infection is consequent to the viral-induced generation of monocyte/macrophage PCA resulting in activation of the coagulation cascade. This, in turn, could trigger the complement and kallikrein systems resulting in bradykinin-mediated vasodilation, increased vascular permeability and eventually granular blood flow. Under the influence of potent chemotactic factors (C3a, C5a, C567 and thrombin), circulating leukocytes would be recruited to the areas of inflammation. Continued elaboration of PCA by monocytes and possibly Kupffer cells would further amplify the original re-sponse. During the acute phase, sinusoidal blockage by microthrombi, in concert with simultaneous viral replication within sinusoidal lining cells and hepatocytes (with disruption of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum), may render the hepatocytes were susceptible to ischemic damage and injury by inflammatory mediators (29). Hepatocellular necrosis, leukocyte infiltration and edema may result in further sinusoidal blockage and potentiation of the parenchymal damage. Such microcirculatory abnormalities have been observed in uivo following the administration of lipopolysaccharide, a potent activator of both the coagulation cascade and monocyte PCA (12,30, 31 1.",
