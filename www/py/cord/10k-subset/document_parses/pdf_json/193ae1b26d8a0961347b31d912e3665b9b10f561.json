In Brazil, there were reports of several enteric disease outbreaks in chickens in which avian nephritis virus (ANV) was detected; however, the role of ANV in the outbreaks and whether the virus was a causative agent of these cases of enteric diseases were not determined. The aim of this study was to isolate ANV in specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryonated eggs (CEE) from the enteric contents of chickens showing signs of RSS. For this purpose, 22 samples of chicken enteric contents that were positive only for ANV were inoculated into 7 and 14-day-old SPF-CEE via the yolk sac route and incubated for 5 d, with a total of 3 passages. Virus isolation was confirmed by the presence of embryo injuries, detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR, and visualization of viral particles using electron microscopy. Therefore, the 7-day-old inoculated embryos showed dwarfism, gelatinous consistency, hemorrhage, and edema in the embryos, whereas the 14-day-old did not show any alteration. Viral RNA was detected in the embryos of both ages of inoculation, and the same viral particles were visualized. The embryos from the mock group showed no alteration and were negative for all the tests. The viral cDNA was sequenced, and the molecular and phylogenetic analyses showed that the Brazilian isolates are more related with the ANV-1 serotype group; the sequences of these isolates showed a high percentage of nucleotide (86.4 to 94.9%) and amino acid (92.3 to 98.7%) similarity with other sequences from China, Japan, Australia, and the United States that belong to this serotype previously classified group. In this study, we isolated 8 samples of ANV in SPF-CEE from enteric content samples from chickens with RSS. In doing so, we showed the pathological injuries to the embryo caused by the virus and the molecular characterization of a part of the ORF 1b gene of the virus.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Enteric diseases are a big problem for animal health as well as in the poultry industry. Infected birds are affected from the first day of birth showing early clinical signs of enteric diseases, principally diarrhea; however, chickens of different ages are also affected, whether or not they are showing clinical signs Smyth et al., 2009; Todd et al., 2010; Mettifogo et al., 2014; Veen et al., 2017; Xue et al., 2017; De la Torre et al., 2018; Kang et al., 2018) . In poultry, runting-stunting syndrome (RSS) is of great relevance to avian intestinal health, and many viruses are involved (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008; Day et al., 2015; Smyth, 2017) . The syndrome is also known as infectious stunting syndrome, pale-bird syndrome, malabsorption syndrome, malassimilation, and helicopter disease (Goodwin et al., 1993; Kang et al., 2012 Kang et al., , 2018 Bulbule et al., 2013; Day and Zsak, 2013; Nu\u00f1ez and Ferreira, 2013; Smyth, 2017) , and was first described by Olsen (1977) . The syndrome is characterized in animals by dwarfism, poor development, diarrhea, and mortality (Kang et al., 2012 (Kang et al., , 2018 Day and Zsak, 2013; Zsak et al., 2013; Domaska-Blicharz et al., 2017) . Chicken parvovirus (ChPV), avian rotavirus (ARTv-A), avian reovirus (AReo), chicken astrovirus (CAstV), and avian nephritis virus (ANV) have been detected in the enteric contents of chickens showing enteric diseases (Goodwin et al., 1993; Otto et al., 2006; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2007 Nu\u00f1ez and Ferreira, 2013; Mettifogo et al., 2014) . ANV was reported and isolated for the first time by Yamaguchi et al. (1977) and is genetically related with the family Astroviridae, and classified as an astrovirus (Imada et al., 2000) . ANV was associated with growth suppression, kidney lesions, and mortality in young chickens (Yamaguchi et al., 1977; Imada et al., 1979; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008) . ANV was known to be reported in many countries around the world, including Japan, the United States, Australia, India, and South America, although mainly reported only in Brazil (Mettifogo et al., 2014) . ANV has been associated with many symptoms beyond kidney injuries, with enteric problems appearing in naturally and experimentally infected animals. These animals experience apathy, weight loss, ruffled feathers, and mortality (Pantin-jackwood et al., 2008; Todd et al., 2010; Kang et al., 2012) . ANV is a single-stranded RNA virus with a genome composed of 3 open reading frames (ORFs). ORF 1a is located close to the 5 terminus of the genome and encodes the viral protease. ORF 1a is followed by ORF 1b that encodes an RNA polymerase (Imada et al., 2000) . ORF 2 encodes the capsid protein precursors and is located after ORF 1b and before the 3 untranslated region (UTR) (Imada et al., 2000; Todd et al., 2011) . ORF 1b is a very conserved gene in ANV genome and is widely used for molecular amplification for diagnosis of ANV Chu et al., 2008) . This polyprotein together with ORF 1a is cleaved into the non-structural proteins required for transcription and viral replication (Marvin, 2017) . The sequencing of ORF 1b gene is not used for astrovirus genotyping where the capsid gene (ORF2) is used (Todd et al., 2011; Smyth et al., 2017; Luna et al., 2016) , but could show similarities or differences between sequences from different serotypes of ANV. Recently, the presence of ANV in chickens, layer hens, and breeders showing signs of enteric diseases was reported in Brazil Mettifogo et al., 2014; Luna et al., 2016; De la Torre et al., 2018) , and many outbreaks of enteric diseases have also been observed (unpublished data). The role of ANV in enteric disease in Brazilian chicken flocks is not well understood, and because there is a lack of viral isolates, it is difficult to study this virus.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 319, "end": 338, "text": "Smyth et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 339, "end": 357, "text": "Todd et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 358, "end": 381, "text": "Mettifogo et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 382, "end": 400, "text": "Veen et al., 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 401, "end": 418, "text": "Xue et al., 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 419, "end": 444, "text": "De la Torre et al., 2018;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 445, "end": 463, "text": "Kang et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 590, "end": 620, "text": "(Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 621, "end": 638, "text": "Day et al., 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 639, "end": 651, "text": "Smyth, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 798, "end": 820, "text": "(Goodwin et al., 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 821, "end": 838, "text": "Kang et al., 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 839, "end": 858, "text": "Kang et al., , 2018", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 859, "end": 880, "text": "Bulbule et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 881, "end": 900, "text": "Day and Zsak, 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 901, "end": 926, "text": "Nu\u00f1ez and Ferreira, 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 927, "end": 939, "text": "Smyth, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 969, "end": 981, "text": "Olsen (1977)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1080, "end": 1098, "text": "(Kang et al., 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1099, "end": 1119, "text": "(Kang et al., , 2018", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1120, "end": 1139, "text": "Day and Zsak, 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1140, "end": 1158, "text": "Zsak et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1159, "end": 1189, "text": "Domaska-Blicharz et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1408, "end": 1430, "text": "(Goodwin et al., 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1431, "end": 1449, "text": "Otto et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1450, "end": 1478, "text": "Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1479, "end": 1504, "text": "Nu\u00f1ez and Ferreira, 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1505, "end": 1528, "text": "Mettifogo et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1583, "end": 1606, "text": "Yamaguchi et al.

Actually, 2 serological groups of ANV, ANV-1 and ANV-2, are recognized. However, molecular studies involving an ORF2 gene that encodes a structural capsid protein showed the presence of 6 genetic like groups, ANV-1 to ANV-6 (Todd et al., 2011) . Officially, there are 3 different astrovirus species that comprises the Avastrovirus genus (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses-ICTV) and the genotypic classification by Astroviridae Study Group proposed 7 avastrovirus genotypes (AAstV-1 to AAstV-7) based on ORF 2 analyses. ANV belongings principally to AAstV-2 and other ANV strains have been detected and isolated from wild and domestic pigeons and were classified in the genotypes 5, 6, and 7. Recently, 2 novel genotypes 8 and 9 were proposed (Luna et al., 2016) . This genetic characterization shows the diversity of this virus and how the strains are distributed around the world. The results presented here suggest that the ANV isolates in SPF-CEE are more related with the sequences of ANV-1 serotype previously classified. However, more studies need to be carried out to characterize the viral capsid (ORF 2 gene) of Brazil-ian\u00b4s isolates shown in the present investigation. The study of the capsid protein genes is important for the understanding of the Astroviridae family, but the difficulty in isolating and propagating astroviruses has limited their molecular characterization (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2011) . In the present work, the difficulty of isolation resulted in only 8 samples from 22 where the isolation of ANV was possible. This lack of viral isolation, as showed here only 3 passages were carried out, is due to many factors such as the low viral concentration in the samples producing blind passages until third passage, viral inactivation is another condition due to management of samples transported to laboratory under weak conditions of temperature, storage conditions before thawing, and freezing the sample before testing, or inoculum preparation in which viral particles are damaged and preclude the replication and propagation. Moreover, more number of samples isolated in eggs of 7 d of age (6 samples) than in eggs of 14 days of age where only 2 samples were shown. This condition could be explained by the fact that in eggs with 7 days of incubation, the yolk is easier to access, but not so in eggs with more days of incubation where the size of the embryo makes it more difficult to reach the yolk and deposit the inoculum.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 290, "end": 311, "text": "(Shirai et al., 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 312, "end": 331, "text": "Imada et al., 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 332, "end": 350, "text": "Todd et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 577, "end": 596, "text": "(Todd et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1108, "end": 1127, "text": "(Luna et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1752, "end": 1782, "text": "(Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 236, "end": 245, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The viral particles of astroviruses were characterized by the star-like surface projection observed on their virions using electron microscopy with negative staining.
