All hospitalized patients between October 2017 and April 2018 with laboratoryconfirmed influenza A and B were included. The primary composite outcomes were pneumonia/myocarditis/encephalitis, mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and 30-day mortality.

For the primary composite outcome, no significant difference was demonstrated between influenza A and B. Rates of mortality were similar at 30 and 90 days. Influenza A had higher pneumonia rates and mechanical ventilation. On multivariate analysis, higher Charlson's score, hypoalbuminemia, and vasopressor use were associated with 30-day mortality, while infection with either influenza A or B was not.

More patients with influenza A suffered from lower respiratory tract infection, and more often required mechanical ventilation, while mortality rates at 30 and 90 days were unaffected. Both groups included elderly to very old patients (mean age of 74 years), with close to 75% of the including patients resided in LTCFs and with high age-adjusted Charlson's comorbidity score. Overall, the rate of influenza-related adverse events was 12.3% which was composed mainly from pneumonia and/or 30-day allcause mortality. Our results suggest that patients hospitalized due to influenza A or influenza B infection are similar in regard to the hosts medical and social background, clinical course, and outcomes, apart from the increased rate of lower respiratory tract infection with influenza A. However, infection with influenza B is as severe as infection with influenza A with increased morbidity and mortality, especially for patients prone to suffer from influenza-related adverse events due to their medical conditions. This finding might correlate with mismatch vaccine year of the influenza B lineage as shown previously [8] . This could also explain why influenza B has represented more than two-thirds of the cases in our cohort, inversely related to their endemic attack rate. Indeed, in Israel, influenza A H 3 N 2 was the predominant species circulating in the community on the 2017-2018 influenza season (76.5%), while influenza B cases were less than 2% [9] . Influenza A is considered by some experts as the most virulent influenza virus type and widespread disease [2] [3] [4] 6] . However, the sparse data on the clinical features of the influenza virus types in hospitalized adults do not consistently support that notion. Several retrospective cohort studies suggested that infection with influenza A may result in higher rates of hospitalization and mortality than infection with influenza B [5, 6] . However, other previous studies suggested a similar course. Among patients with influenza who were admitted to medical ICU, influenza A was associated with increased rate of viral pneumonia, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but mortality, LOS at ICU admission, and other clinical outcomes did not differ between influenza A-and influenza B-infected patients [8] , similarly to our study. Among ambulatory adults with seasonal influenza, clinical features and outcomes (hospitalization, antibiotic prescription, pneumonia) of influenza A (H 3 N 2 strain) and influenza B were similar in a prospective study [7] ; however, patients with influenza A sought medical attention earlier. Further data from studies on pediatric patients with influenza demonstrated mixed results. Children with influenza B had increased mortality rates and ICU admission [10] . Study on mixed ambulatory population in Canada [11] suggested that patients infected with influenza A had increased rate of chronic pulmonary conditions, and other comorbidities, while patients infected with influenza B were significantly younger (median age 13, range 3-43, vs. 42, range 2-83) and more likely to reside at rural areas. The largest study by Cahves et al. [12] which examined the clinical features of patients with influenza A serotypes (H 3 N 2 and H 1 N 1(pdm09) ) and influenza B demonstrated an increase in severe outcomes (ICU admission and/or mortality) with influenza A H 1 N 1(pdm09) compared with H 3 N 2 and influenza B.

Third, data on the current influenza vaccine were unavailable for significant percentage of the patients because of technical difficulties in retrieving data.
