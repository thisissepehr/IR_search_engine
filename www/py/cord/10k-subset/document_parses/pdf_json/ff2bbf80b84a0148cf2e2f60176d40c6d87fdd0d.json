While a fluid interface separates two fluids, membranes separate the inside of vesicles from the outside, the interior of biological cells from the environment, and compartmentalize cells into organelles. The physical properties of interfaces are characterized by interface tension, those of membranes are characterized by bending and stretching elasticity. Amphiphilic molecules like surfactants that are added to a system with two immiscible fluids decrease the interface tension and induce a bending rigidity. Lipid bilayer membranes of vesicles can be stretched or compressed by osmotic pressure; in biological cells, also the presence of a cytoskeleton can induce membrane tension. If the thickness of the interface or the membrane is small compared with its lateral extension, both can be described using two-dimensional mathematical surfaces embedded in three-dimensional space. We review recent work on the interaction of particles with interfaces and membranes. This can be micrometer-sized particles at interfaces that stabilise emulsions or form colloidosomes, as well as typically nanometer-sized particles at membranes, such as viruses, parasites, and engineered drug delivery systems. In both cases, we first discuss the interaction of single particles with interfaces and membranes, e.g. particles in external fields, non-spherical particles, and particles at curved interfaces, followed by interface-mediated interaction between two particles, many-particle interactions, interface and membrane curvature-induced phenomena, and applications.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Keywords: membranes, nanoparticles, capillary interactions, lipid bilayers, emulsions, viruses, interfaces (Some figures may appear in colour only in the online journal)", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Original content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence.

For high aspect ratios or round edges of the particles, rod-like particles bind with their blunt tips in rocket orientation only with a very small fraction of their surface area. They then rotate to submarine orientation in the shallow-wrapped state, and back to rocket orientation in the deep-wrapped state [176, 186] , see figure 40.

Therefore, the membrane-mediated interactions because of deformation-energy are expected to be repulsive [169, 204] . However, for spherical particles the attractive membrane-mediated interactions because of membrane-particle adhesion energy dominate and lead to an overall attraction [203] .

From a biological point of view, nanoparticles are interesting in nanomedicine as biomarkes and drug carriers, but their effect on cells also has to be assessed because of their potential nanotoxicity. In addition, there is a large range of biological particles, such as viruses and parasites, the interaction of which with cells is also highly desirable to be controlled. The interaction of single hard particles with interfaces is by now reasonably well understood. Therefore, we believe that future research should move towards particle-mediated interactions and collective properties for many particles at both fluid and biological interfaces, as well as towards soft particles. For example, size and concentration effects for the interaction or nanoparticles with liposomes and polymersomes have been studied using electron microscopy and scattering [49] [50] [51] . Using force measurements, nanoparticlemediated adhesion between elastic gels has been measured [243] . The hard particles can serve as 'glue' between soft interfaces.
