            "text": "In studying the efficacy of the inactivation of B19 by PCT, an efficient, straightforward, in vitro assay correlating with infectivity was lacking. Present assays for determining the inactivation of B19 are limited and vary in sensitivity and detection ability. For instance, genome equivalence (gEq) methods measure only a small portion of the viral genome via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine the gEq titer. An incomplete or altered viral particle, although rendered noninfectious, could potentially result as a positive gEq and artificially increase the viral titer. If available, the use of full-length genome PCR primers would remedy the problem; however, PCR is not quantitative. Biological assays, although able to measure infectious titers, are time consuming, labor intensive, and limited by assay volume. Taking into consideration the shortcomings of each assay, we have developed a new quantitative PCR (QPCR) test of viral replicative function to demonstrate the effectiveness of PCT against B19. Rather than measuring the relative presence of parent DNA, the assay measures the replicative ability of the inactivated parent DNA by comparing similarly preamplified untreated and treated viral preparations using QPCR. An inhibition of preamplification to the level of baseline control would demonstrate complete inactivation of the virus. This assay is easy and simple to perform and demonstrates a strong correlation with infectivity. In combination, the results from an infectivity assay, full-length PCR amplification, and our novel assay of preamplification and QPCR demonstrated 5-6 log of B19 inactivation by PCT. Furthermore, the QPCR assay using preamplification PCR inhibition can be applied to future investigations of pathogen inactivation.",

Figure 6A shows the preamplification conditions of amplicon size and number of cycles. To illustrate how the number of preamplification cycles directly determined the range of log inhibition possible, the same controls were performed to measure the dynamic range for testing HBV amplification. As with B19, the HBV primers generated amplicons of increasing length, and the preamplification PCR conditions were normalized to produce the same number of copies ( figure 6B ). In the case of HBV, the preamplification cycles were normalized to 14 cycles of a 495-bp amplicon.

In the present study, we developed a novel preamplification QPCR inhibition assay that was used to estimate reductions in viral infectivity for B19.

To optimize the assay, the analysis of varying lengths of PCR products determined which amplicon size was necessary to detect PCT inactivation. As the amplicon lengths increased, more preamplification cycles were necessary to produce equal number of copies because of decreased replication efficiency for longer PCR products.

            "text": "In introducing the preamplification QPCR inhibition assay as a potential inactivation test, our studies also revealed ways to improve the assay and increase its sensitivity and range. For example, increasing the number of preamplification cycles would broaden the log sensitivity of the assay, as was demonstrated using the conditions applied for detecting HBV inhibition, compared with B19. The amount of parent DNA is the baseline, and increasing the amplification range would provide greater potential to detect finer differences between control and PCT samples. Mathematically, this is true because the preamplification conditions were normalized to equal the smallest amplicon, which was subjected to 8 preamplification cycles for B19 and to 14 preamplification cycles for HBV. Under the assumption of 100% PCR efficiency, 8 preamplification cycles increased the copy number of the 244-bp amplicon by 2 8 or , just over 2 log; and 14 preamplification cycles, under 2 2.6 \u03eb 10 the assumption of 100% efficiency, would yield 1.6 \u03eb 10 4 copies, or \u223c4 log. In the case of HBV, the PCR was not 100% efficient; therefore, the log range was \u223c3.6 log. The perfect imposition of all preamplification products for each virus showed that PCR efficiency decreased with increasing amplicon sizes; thus, to maintain the 2-log B19 preamplification range, 10 cycles were needed for the 926-bp amplicon, 16 for the 3-kb amplicon, and 30 for the 5-kb amplicon. These controls established the range of log inhibition of this assay. Therefore, a log inhibition of amplification of 2 log in PCT-treated, B19-contaminated plasma samples would demonstrate complete inactivation to the limit of detection. Another method to increase the detection range of the assay is to shift the baseline curve. Because the QPCR amplicon, which detects the preamplification difference between control and PCT samples, is typically small (80-100 bp), the QPCR step amplifies the parent DNA, regardless of whether there is a cross-link in another region of the genome. Statistically, PCT causes cross-links in \u223c1 of every 83 bp; thus, the likelihood that the QPCR primers will amplify a region that lacks an adduct is very high. Therefore, although the parent DNA was cross-linked by PCT, the QPCR assay failed to detect it. The use of a longer QPCR target would decrease the statistical occurrence of the primers amplifying by chance a region that does not have an adduct and would improve the assay by increasing the log range of inactivation possible without having to increase the number of preamplification cycles.",

A linear relationship was identified by using both assays to measure the effect of 45-60 min of preincubation with amotosalen before illumination with UVA. For instance, a 2-log preamplification QPCR inhibition was equivalent to a 5.6-log reduction in infectivity. By establishing the reference curve between QPCR and infectivity, one can extrapolate the level of the inactivation of infectivity by performing only the QPCR assay. In conclusion, this novel PCR inhibition assay effectively demonstrates that PCT inactivates B19 and HBV in blood products.",
