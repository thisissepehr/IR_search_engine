In this paper, we identify a number of characteristic features of influenza incidence time series in temperate regions, including ranges of annual attack rates and outbreak durations. By constraining the output of simple models to match these characteristic features, we investigate the role played by population heterogeneity, multiple strains, cross-immunity and the rate of strain evolution in the generation of incidence time series. Results indicate that an age-structured model with non-random mixing and cocirculating strains are both required to match observed time-series data. Our work gives estimates of the seasonal peak basic reproduction number, R 0 , in the range 1.6-3. Estimates of R 0 are strongly correlated with the timescale for waning of immunity to current circulating seasonal influenza strain, which we estimate is between 3 and 8 years. Seasonal variation in transmissibility is largely confined to 15-30% of its mean value.

The vast majority of seasonal influenza outbreaks are observed between the extremes of mid-November and the end of April [11] . Since a background rate of ILI incidence is present throughout the year, duration is difficult to define precisely. The range of values quoted for the duration of an annual epidemic (described with the acronym ADE in this paper) is typically between three and 16 weeks [1, 16] . -Attack rate. The proportion of the population infected in a year, which we term the AAR, is very difficult to determine, as a significant proportion of infections are asymptomatic and only a proportion of symptomatic cases seek healthcare. Hence sentinel data on ILI can only give relative information, such as the fractional variation in incidence over time. In addition, measures such as ILI are non-specific for influenza and can be caused by a variety of respiratory pathogens. That said, ILI data from France and the UK indicate a standard deviation for AAR across successive years of approximately 40 per cent of the mean attack rate [17, 18] . Results from serological and virus isolation data from closely monitored populations indicate an AAR range of approximately 10-20% for seasonal influenza, rising to 30 per cent or more for influenza pandemics [1, 17] . Information on consultation rates for known cases also suggests a mean AAR of around 15 per cent [13, 18, 19 ]. -Periodic behaviour. Seasonal influenza is characterized by annual outbreaks in temperate countries in the sense that there is almost invariably a marked seasonal increase in case rate during the winter months. However, it cannot be said to be periodic in the sense that successive outbreaks are comparable in magnitude and form with each other. In this sense, seasonal influenza has no clear periodicity (annual, biennial and triennial) and contrasts with the behaviour of diseases such as measles, which has a pronounced biennial structure in the pre-immunization period [5] . The metrics that we use to compare model and time-series behaviour are able to pick up this characteristic aperiodicity. -Strain variation. Virus isolation studies show that individual seasonal epidemics are usually dominated by a single type and/or subtype, although others may be present at low levels [13] .

Our model caricatures this process with a timescale, D, for resistant individuals to become susceptible to the current strain again. As antigenically distinct clusters appear every 2 -8 years [8, 24] , this is our expected range for values of D. There is evidence from contact studies and from modelling of influenza epidemics that infectious contact between individuals is highly assortative and agedependent, with the highest rates among school-age children [16, 25, 26] . We include these effects by stratifying the population into children (less than or equal to 14 years) and adults (more than 14 years) and employing a mixing matrix to describe contact between the two groups. The degree of assortativity is controlled by the parameter, u, and can be varied between random mixing (u \u00bc 0), where groups contact each other proportional to the fraction of the population they represent, and wholly assortative (u \u00bc 1) where each group mixes only with itself.

In discussing the behaviour of the model, periodicity refers to the periodicity of the overall case rate with time, rather than for an individual strain. Simulations were run using a population of 60 million, approximating the population of the UK. Owing to the large population, a deterministic model was used. Tests using the corresponding stochastic models showed no qualitative variation from the deterministic dynamics and the presence of a continuous low level external force of infection precluded the possibility of extinction. Figure 3 illustrates the behaviour of the model and aspects of the information distance between model and data as a function of R p and D. The region of best fits is located in a narrow diagonal band spanning 1.6 , R p , 2.5 and 3 , D , 8 (figure 3d ). Along this band, increasing reproduction number is compensated for by a longer period of effective immunity that decreases the susceptible proportion of the population, giving a constant mean attack rate. The acceptable region is bounded in part by the duration of the model epidemics. The lowest and highest values of R p generate epidemics that are too broad and too narrow, compared with the target distribution. The fit of the model is strongly constrained by the dynamics of the model, which exhibits a wide range of periodic behaviour across quite small changes in parameter values (figure 3a). While AAR changes smoothly with the parameters, abrupt changes in periodicity lead to qualitative changes in the distributions of AAR and epidemic duration and hence the KL distance. Best-fit behaviour is associated with long-period behaviour of the model (4\u00fe years). Here, the model generates a range of AARs clustered around the mean and matching the target distribution. The qualitatively different forms of behaviour are well characterized by the total KL distance measure (figure 4). KL distances less than 200 correspond to realistic behaviour with appropriate mean attack rate distributions (figure 4a). KL distance between 200 and 300 match either with realistic behaviour interspersed with large-scale epidemic episodes or with realistic behaviour but with a mean attack rate displaced from the target value ( figure 4b) . Larger values represent dynamics and mean attack rates greatly different from the observed time series (figure 4c). Figure 5 illustrates a strong sensitivity to the amplitude of variation of the contact parameter, d, with the best-fit lying in the range 0.15-0.3. Although the mean AAR is not strongly dependent on d (figure 5a), the bifurcation behaviour of the model means realistic solutions (resembling figure 4a,b) can be found for higher amplitudes of seasonal variation but not in a contiguous region (figure 5b). Solutions with smaller seasonal variations are rejected on the epidemic duration component of the information distance. Low amplitudes generate broad epidemics which do not match the target distribution.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 645, "end": 653, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 2318, "end": 2328, "text": "figure 4b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2447, "end": 2455, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": null}], "section": "MODEL AND FITTING TECHNIQUE"}, {"text": "The behaviour of our model is quite sensitive to the assumed external force of infection, e. The level of external forcing assumed for most of this work ( \u00a72) is negligible compared with the average force of infection generated by the indigenous population. However, long-period and chaotic solutions for seasonally forced SIR models generate very low infection prevalence during epidemic troughs, even low levels of importation of infectives strongly encourages annual and biennial behaviours and removes highly chaotic solutions from the optimal region. The effect of importation rate can be seen in figure 6 . For external forces of infection above about 10 25 yr -1 , only annual and biennial solutions are found. Optimal behaviour is found for an external force of infection of approximately 6 \u00c2 10 27 yr -1 . Figure 7 explores the sensitivity of the model to the degree of heterogeneity and cross-immunity in the population. The choice of R p and D lies in the wellfitting band in figure 3d. It is clear that a wide range of values for these parameters allow the model to fit the behaviour of the time series quite well. The model's qualitative behaviour (in terms of its periodicity) is more stable with respect to these mechanisms and variation within the closest fit region mainly affects the mean attack rate. There is a broadly inverse relationship between the well-fitting values of the parameters u and f. Increasing the assortativity of mixing concentrates infections more strongly in age groups, decreasing the available susceptibles and hence the attack rate. Increasing cross-immunity has an equivalent effect by increasing the effective loss of susceptibles caused by any single infection event and hence reducing the attack rate. As can be seen from figure 7a, values of the cross-immunity parameter f outside the range 0.3-0.6 drive the model into unfavourable periodicities, giving very poor fits. This suggests that a model with two strains interacting via cross-immunity is necessary to reproduce the dynamics seen in influenza time series and that it is insufficient to have two independent strains (f \u00bc 0) or two antigenically identical strains (i.e. f \u00bc 12equivalent to a single strain model).

We find that an age-structured population and multiple strains with cross-immunity are necessary to recreate the distributions of AAR and epidemic duration seen in time-series data. Nonlinear models of this type with temporal forcing are well known for having complex bifurcation structures affecting their periodic behaviour. On the timescale of a single disease season or single epidemic, these would have little effect on parameter estimation. Over many seasons, however, the periodicity of the underlying model is crucially important. We would argue that capturing the long-term trends in behaviour is at least as important as the detail of individual seasonal outbreaks and our fitting approach focuses on these aspects. The complex bifurcation structure of the model means that the information distance is not necessarily a smooth function of the parameters. This makes finding a unique set of parameters giving an overall minimum distance impossible. Although mean attack rate and duration generally vary smoothly, the period of the model solution changes discontinuously (inevitably, as it only takes values that are multiples of the annual forcing period). Solutions with longer periods generate a wider range of AAR and epidemic durations over an extended period of time and are therefore capable of fitting the target data distributions better.

Figure 3 illustrates that increasing R 0 is offset by a longer duration of immunity reducing the susceptible population. The narrowness of the well-fitting parameter region is a result of the sudden changes of behaviour generated by changes in these parameters. Figure 5 also illustrates this feature. The closest fitting region is found for d between 0.15 and 0.3, but patches of well-fitting solutions are scattered a range of values of R p and d owing to the sensitivity to the system to temporal forcing. We note that a change in the mode of forcing from sinusoidal to school-term leads to generally broader ranges of acceptable parameter values (see the electronic supplementary material), perhaps indicating that the presence of this mechanism is a strong contributor to the variable annual behaviour observed in the ILI dataset. Because of the difficulties in knowing the 'true' incidence rate, the mean AAR is not precisely known and a range of 10-20% is often quoted. To allow for this uncertainty, we investigated allowing the information distance calculation to be based on the best-fit mean AAR from the range 10-20%, rather than precisely 15 per cent per year. Resulting best-fit parameter regions for R 0 against D and u against f were not significantly changed, owing almost certainly to the dominance of qualitative model behaviour as described above.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 104, "end": 112, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 366, "end": 374, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": null}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Incidence periodicity of the model is much less sensitive to cross-immunity and age structure, resulting in a wide region of close fitting behaviour for values of u between about 0.2 and 0.6 and f between 0.3 and 0.5. As discussed in \u00a73, this strongly suggests that an agestructured population and, in particular, a pathogen population with more than one strain and crossimmunity, are necessary to reproduce the patterns of behaviour found in the ILI time series. Models based on single strains and well-mixed populations generate annual and biennial behaviour for the same parameter values.

In addition, the infection rate was described by the phenomenological term b I a g(S). Exponents of this type are well known to facilitate fitting [5] , but are hard to interpret. We note that both the form of this term and the non-exponentially distributed duration of immunity in that study affect epidemic attack rates as a function of transmissibility and the periodicity of epidemics, and hence may play an equivalent role to age structure and the incorporation of two subtypes in our model in allowing a good fit to the data.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 141, "end": 145, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 438, "end": 441, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Shaman et al. [14] use a similar SIRS model to investigate the possibility that seasonal changes in absolute humidity can generate recorded patterns in pneumonia and influenza mortality data. The model was stochastic, has no age structure, and effectively uses only one strain. Best-fit parameter values are similar to those found in this work, although the relative amplitude of variation in R 0 is in the range 0.4-0.5, significantly higher than our findings. Best-fit parameter sets showed considerable lack of correlation with each other, which the authors attribute to the stochastic nature of their model. Our work suggests that this scatter may be the result of the complex bifurcational structure of such models. As already discussed, our results indicate that a two strain model without cross-immunity or age structure is unlikely to fit patterns of seasonal influenza from a temperate region. However, there are several significant differences between the two systems. Shaman et al. employ a significantly higher background force of infection than ours (approx. 7.3 \u00c2 10 24 yr -1 ), which would place our model in a strongly annual or biennial regime.
