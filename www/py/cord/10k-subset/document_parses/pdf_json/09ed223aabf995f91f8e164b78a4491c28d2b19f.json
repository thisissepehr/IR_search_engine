            "text": "A morphological study of selected white matter lesions was carried out in three dogs with canine distemper encephalomyelitis. Two dogs had experimental infections while the third was a spontaneous case. Two stages were identified in the process of demyelination. The earliest evidence of myelin injury was a ballooning change in myelin sheaths involving single or multiple axons. This was followed by a progressive stripping of compact sheaths by the cytoplasmic fingers of phagocytic cells which infiltrated and removed myelin lamellae. Some axonal necrosis also accompanied these changes. Where demyelination occurred, canine distemper viral nucleocapsids were found in astrocytes, macrophages, ependymal cells and infiltrating lymphocytes. In contrast, oligodendrocytes were conspicuous by their apparent lack of infection. Thus it seems that myelin loss cannot be ascribed to oligodendrocyte infection. Perturbed astrocyte function following canine distemper viral infection may cause oedema of myelin sheaths, leading to ballooning and primary demyelination. Cells which phagocytosed myelin were mainly identified as microglial cells with lesser involvement by astrocytes. Rarely, oligodendrocytes also acted as macrophages. Myelin debris was engulfed in bulk or as small droplets into coated pits. Remyelination was present in established plaques although not in great abundance, perhaps due to the diminished oligodendrocyte numbers and a relative increase in immature forms of these cells. These observations are compared to similar changes observed in other demyelinating diseases of animals and man.",

The aetiology and pathogenesis of this disorder remain elusive but are areas of active investigation. Studies of murine models of MS have demonstrated that myelin loss may follow lytic oligodendrocyte infection (mouse corona virus infection, see Lampert et al., 1973) or can result from an immunopathological attack on persistently infected oligodendrocytes (Theilers disease, see Rodriguez et al., 1983) . Canine distemper encephalomyelitis (CDE) has been proposed as a further model of MS (Koestner, 1975) . Canine distemper is caused by a morbillivirus, certain strains of which will induce a high incidence of CNS demyelination (Summers et aI., 1979; Higgins et al., 1982b) .",

These dogs were perfused at 24 and 45 clays post-infection with 3-4 litres of 1% Karnovsky's solution delivered into the left ventricle. Specimens were taken from periventricular white matter areas: the crus of the fornix at the lateral ventricle and the cerebellar medulla adjacent to the fourth ventricle. The third animal (spontaneous case) had shown neurological signs for 4 weeks. Following perfusion of this animal, tissue was taken from the ventral funiculus of the lumbar spinal 0300-4864/87 $03.00 + .12 9 1987 Chapman and Hall Ltd. cord. Tissue from this dog was kindly provided by Dr C. S. Raine, New York. From the experimental cases, adjacent areas of the brain were postfixed in 10% buffered formalin and processed through paraffin for light microscopy. Sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Tissues for electron microscopy were routinely postfixed in 1% OsO4, dehydrated and embedded in Epon. Sections, 1 ~tm thick, stained with toluidine blue were examined for white matter lesions. Selected areas were thin sectioned, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in a Philips 300 electron microscope.",

As this spongiform change became more severe, vacuoles apparently coalesced, producing a zone (or plaque) of demyelination ( Fig. 1 ). Very rarely it was possible to visualize the axon within the distended myelin sheaths (Fig. 2 ). This myelin change was consistently accompanied by a pronounced astrocytosis; some reactive astrocytes had hypertrophic, open-faced nuclei and swollen cytoplasm (Fig. 3) . Multi-nucleated astrocytes were also seen. A mild proliferation of rod cells (microglia) accompanied this astrocytosis. Expansion of white matter lesions appeared to develop by further ballooning change at the margin of a zone of demyelinated white matter (see Fig. 1 ); a few distinct vacuoles could usually be found within the demyelinated zone as well. As lesions developed an inflammatory nature (seen at day 42 and in the spontaneous case) with an influx of lymphocytes and plasma cells, the demyelinated neuropil became more rarified, disrupted and in areas frankly necrotic if the mononuclear cell infiltrate was heavy. Foamy macrophages were evident in the meshwork of naked axons and glial processes.",

The ballooned myelin sheath was formed from full or partial thickness of the sheath. It was not possible to determine whether sheaths split consistently at the major dense line or intraperiod line. Ballooned sheaths were empty or contained a slightly flocculent, electron-dense material. Sometimes processes of astroglial or microglial cells were seen adjacent to the swollen sheath. (Because of the controversy regarding microglial cells see Kitamura et al. (1984) and Schelper & Adrian (1986) -which is discussed below, we have used this term to denote the precursors of the predominant macrophages within the plaques.) In other areas, myelin sheath ballooning was seen about groups of several axons. Whereas some fibres appeared intact, others were swollen with the accumulation of lysosomal and membranous dense bodies, mitochondria and multivesicular bodies. These degenerate, sometimes swollen axons were also partially or totally denuded of myelin (Fig. 7) . Axonal necrosis and lysis was evident from large, empty myelin sheaths and from broad expanses of astroglial and microglial cell processes, apparently filling the neuropil where destruction of myelinated fibres had occurred.",

Light microscopic examination showed that ballooning was the earliest evidence of myelin disruption. As the plaques expanded it was possible to identify a centrally demyelinated core, a narrow vacuolated zone at the margin and the adjacent normal white matter. At the electron microscopic level, this sponginess was found to result from pronounced ballooning of myelin sheaths from the axon. Sometimes the balloon myelin resulted from a split in the myelin sheath, leaving part of the sheath still covering the axon while the remainder formed the balloon. Myelin preservation was inadequate to determine whether sheaths split at the Fig. 6 . Ballooning of myelin from a single axon. Other myelinated fibres are intact.

Although the ultrastructural features of the microglial cell are well documented (Mori & Leblond, 1969) , its source and ultimate function are still strongly debated (Schelper & Adrian, 1986) . The mesodermal derivation of microglia is now less secure (Kitamura et al., 1984) . Central to the issue is whether all CNS macrophages are of rnonocyte origin or whether these microglial cells are indeed a local source of phagocytes. From this study it appeared that cells compatible with reactive microglia, their processes often conveniently identified ultrastructurally by tubuloreticular inclusions within their endoplasmic reticulum, most commonly performed the process of myelin stripping and phagocytosis. This occurred in the absence of flagrant perivascular cuffs of mononuclear cells (such as monocytes). However, in evaluating blood vessels for such cells we sometimes noted swollen pericytic cells or extravascular, flattened macrophageqike cells in the perivascular compartment; pericytes may contribute to the pool of local macrophages (Baron & Gallego, 1972) and have been designated by others the \"pericytic microglia'.",

A proliferation of astroglial cells could follow direct virus infection of these cells.

Raine (1976) described viral inclusions in 'occasional oligodendrocytes'. Occasional degenerating or necrotic cells were found in the white matter lesion in this study (noted also by Raine, 1976) and some or all may be oligodendrocytes. Thus, although rapid CDVinduced cytolysis must be considered, the absence of acute cytolysis of other infected neurectodermal cells makes this proposition unappealing. It is further possible that oligodendrocytes are sites of defective viral infection with failure of viral assembly.

            "text": "In contrast to oligodendrocytes, astroglial infection by CDV is readily and consistently demonstrated by all authors and perhaps is the primary target in white matter. It is recognized that astrocytes are important in maintaining ionic homeostasis within the neuroparenchyrna (Duffy, 1983) . Furthermore, they appear to contribute specifically to stability at the node of Ranvier (Raine, 1984a; Ffrench-Constant et al., 1986; Waxman, 1986) . Indeed Sims et al. (1985) suggested that the perinodal astrocyte process may play a role in the development and maintenance of central myelin. Accordingly, we propose that metabolic disturbances resulting from astrocyte infection may initiate the focal oedema and myelin ballooning that marks the initial white matter injury in CDE. Myelin ballooning could well have consequences for other, still compact internodes, maintained by the same oligodendrocyte. Subtle alterations, perhaps expressed at the surface of these internodes may attract local macrophages (microglia, astroglia) which invade and demyelinate these fibres. Lampert (1978) has commented that this myelin stripping is a non-specific pattern of demyelination that always follows damage to myelin sheaths or myelin-supporting cells. The concept of bystander demyelination, whereby the release of inflammatory mediators non-specifically injures myelin sheaths would seem to have little support from this study. We commonly observed fields of mixed demyelinated and intact axons in immediate proximity, indicating that loss of the sheath involved a selective rather than haphazard process. Higgins et al. (1982b) , in their studies of demyelinating CDE, came to the same conclusion.",

Evidence of remyelination was found, although not in great abundance, probably in concurrence with earlier studies (McCullough et al., 1974; Higgins et al., 1982b) . This may relate to the apparent replacement of mature (medium and dark) oligodendrocyte s by the light variety in wellestablished white matter lesions. Light oligodendrocytes have the most active mitotic activity (Mori & Leblond, 1970) and are probably progenitors of the dark, mature forms which contain the organelles (endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi) associated with synthetic functions. Furthermore, demyelinated axons in the loosened neuropil were invested by astroglial processes which sometimes formed spiral wrapping as others have noted in CDE (Wisniewski et al., 1972; Higgins et al., 1982b) . This astrogiial response may recapitulate development of the CNS wherein astroglial processes ensheath developing axons prior to their investment by cytoplasmic extensions of the oligodendroglia (Nagashima, 1979 ). This has also been shown in organotypic cultures of the CNS (Munoz-Garcia & Ludwin, 1986) . Whether Lymphocyte-mediated immune cytotoxicity in dogs infected with virulent canine distemper virus.

Tapered myelin sheaths and aberrantly located lateral loops which we encountered, albeit rarely, have been observed in lesions of MS (Prineas, 1975; Prineas & Connell, 1979) , and in Balo's concentric sclerosis (Moore et al., 1985) , a probable variant of MS, and are taken to indicate myelin repair. The role of the lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate which appears in the more chronic phase of CDE has not been defined. In general, evidence that immune mechanisms play a primary role in myelin injury in CDE are lacking . In marked contrast; white matter lesions in CDE are ~irectly associated with the presence of the virus, or its proteins, in the tissue (Vandevelde et al., 1985; Mitchell, 1987) . Virus was not found in non-lesion areas (Wisniewski et al., 1972) . We concur with the interpretation offere3 by Bollo et al. (1986) that these infiltrating cells are responding to viral rather than myelin antigens, and are attempting to clear the brain of the persistent infection. It appears that if the immune response is prompt, clearance can be effected (Appel et al., 1982) and the animal recovers. If the inflammatory reaction is delayed, the lesions expand and may change from demyelinating to necrotizing (Wisniewski et al., 1972) . The capacity of astrocytes to present antigens to infiltrating T-cells may trigger this destructive process (Sun & Wekerle, 1986) , resulting in the release of lymphotoxins which produce tissue necrosis. Clarification of these events and related questions (are the astrocytes Ia positive?) should prove of interest to investigators of demyelinating diseases of the CNS. ",
