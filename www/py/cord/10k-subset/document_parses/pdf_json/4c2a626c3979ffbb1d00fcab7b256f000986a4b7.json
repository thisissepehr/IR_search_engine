Such fluctuations suggest that zinc(II) ions are signalling ions used for the regulation of proteins. One function is the inhibition of enzymes. It is quite common that enzymes bind zinc(II) ions with micro-or nanomolar affinities in their active sites that contain catalytic dyads or triads with a combination of glutamate (aspartate), histidine and cysteine residues, which are all typical zinc-binding ligands. However, for such binding to be physiologically significant, the binding constants must be compatible with the cellular availability of zinc(II) ions. The affinity of inhibitory zinc(II) ions for receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase b is particularly high (K i = 21 pM, pH 7.4), indicating that some enzymes bind zinc almost as strongly as zinc metalloenzymes. The competitive pattern of zinc inhibition for this phosphatase implicates its active site cysteine and nearby residues in the coordination of zinc. Quantitative biophysical data on both affinities of proteins for zinc and cellular zinc(II) ion concentrations provide the basis for examining the physiological significance of inhibitory zinc-binding sites in proteins and the role of zinc(II) ions in cellular signalling.

Consequently, zinc(II) ions bind much stronger to proteins than transition metal ions such as iron(II) and manganese(II) or alkaline earth metal ions such as Mg (II) and Ca(II).

Cellular buffering of zinc results in free zinc(II) ion concentrations in the range of tens to hundreds of picomolar (often given as the ''zinc potential'', pZn = -log[Zn 2? ] = 10-11) (Colvin et al. 2010 ). These concentrations are commensurate with the affinities of zinc(II) ions for cytosolic zinc-requiring metalloproteins, which are picomolar or lower ).

Zinc inhibition of caspase-3 was noted with a K i value of about 100 nM (Perry et al. 1997 ), but the inhibition occurs with an IC 50 of \\10 nM zinc (Maret et al. 1999 ).

Caspase-6 is also an executioner caspase. Zinc inhibits the human enzyme allosterically at a site involving Lys-36, Glu-244, and His-287 as ligands with a K i of 150 nM (pH 7.5) (Velazquez-Delgado and Hardy 2012). When zinc binds to the allosteric site and locks the enzyme in the helical conformation, the histidine and cysteine residues in the catalytic dyad are 9 \u00c5 apart and hence do not bind zinc. However, when the enzyme adopts the canonical conformation, zinc is thought to bind to the catalytic dyad. Recruitment of the e-amino group of lysine as a ligand is quite unusual. It may also occur in zinc-inhibited glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, where a catalytic lysine, an aspartate and another lysine are part of the active site (Ou et al. 2006 ). The enzyme is inhibited with an IC 50 of 100 nM, but only at slightly alkaline pH 8.4 (Maret et al. 2001 ). This pH effect could indicate the ionization of the lysine(s) in the active site. Zinc inhibition of caspase-6 at two sites demonstrates that zinc inhibition of enzymes is more subtle than presently acknowledged and can regulate activity at least at two levels on the same enzyme-without accounting for the interaction of caspases with zincbinding domains of inhibitory proteins. The zinc inhibition constant of the executioner caspase-9 is 300 nM (pH 7.5). Caspase-9 binds two zinc ions. The model indicates that His-237, Cys-239, both forming the catalytic dyad, and Cys-287 bind one zinc and that His-224, Cys-229, -230 and -272 bind a second zinc (Huber and Hardy 2012) . The second site has the characteristics of a structural zinc site. Caspases-3, -6, -7, -8, -9 are all involved in apoptosis and have the catalytic Cys-His dyad, but they differ with regard to the third active site residue possibly involved in metal binding, which is Asp, Glu, or Cys. Based on sequence homology among caspases, the zinc-binding site in caspase-3 comprises His-121, Asp-123, and Cys-163. Regarding the binding of zinc at active sites, there is at least one other general principle. Zinc inhibits rabbit muscle phosphoglucomutase by binding at a site that is normally occupied by a catalytic magnesium ion. The K i value of the enzyme for zinc is 4 pM (pH 8.5) (Peck and Ray 1971) . The 3D structure has been determined with cadmium in the active site. The ligands are three carboxylates from aspartates, each binding monodentate, and the oxygen from the Ser-16 side chain. The free zinc(II) ion concentration in muscle of 32 pM (Ray 1969) indicates that zinc inhibits the enzyme under physiological conditions and that the enzyme needs to be activated by removing the inhibitory zinc.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 125, "end": 143, "text": "(Perry et al. 1997", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 202, "end": 220, "text": "(Maret et al. 1999", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 313, "end": 335, "text": "(Costello et al. 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 599, "end": 630, "text": "Biometals (2013) 26:197-204 199", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 660, "end": 681, "text": "(Petersen et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1426, "end": 1441, "text": "(Ou et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1531, "end": 1549, "text": "(Maret et al. 2001", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2204, "end": 2226, "text": "(Huber and Hardy 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2905, "end": 2924, "text": "(Peck and Ray 1971)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 3173, "end": 3183, "text": "(Ray 1969)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Intracellular zinc-binding sites"}, {"text": "Zinc(II) ions inhibit human erythrocyte Ca 2? -ATPase with a K i of 80 pM (pH 7.4) (Hogstrand et al. 1999) .

Micromolar zinc(II) ion concentrations inhibit bovine carboxypeptidase A at a second zinc-binding site next to the catalytic zinc (K i = 0.5 lM). Zinc also inhibits serine proteases such as kallikreins with inhibition constants ranging from 10 nM to about 10 lM. In the case of carboxypeptidase A, the inhibitory zinc binds to only one protein ligand (Glu-270) but is also held in place by a hydroxy bridge to the catalytic zinc ion. In the kallikreins, the zinc ligands are either two histidines or a histidine and a glutamate. A third ligand may further stabilize the zinc/protein interaction. A case can be made for physiological significance of these interactions because some kallikreins are found in seminal and prostatic fluids, which contain about 10 mM zinc. Presumably, the inhibitory zinc dissociates when these enzymes are secreted and diluted. Secreted zinc(II) ions are also involved in intercellular zinc signalling.

An inhibitory role may seem counterintuitive as zinc activates proteins in the form of zinc metalloenzymes. However, regulatory activation is generally not considered because zinc enzymes are thought to always contain their metal ion. This tenet is based on the observation that isolated zinc enzymes usually have a full complement of zinc. The issue whether or not the zinc content of zinc metalloenzymes varies dependent on physiological conditions has not been tested rigorously, in particular because zinc proteins are now rarely isolated from their original tissues but instead prepared from heterologous expression systems.

The K i values are in the range of the K d values for zinc in zinc enzymes.

Enzymes such as serine and cysteine proteinases or ribonucleases, e.g. angiogenins (Iyer et al. 2013) (Table 1) are therefore prone to be metal inhibited. From the limited number of structures available (Table 1) , the coordination environments of inhibitory sites at the active sites or allosteric sites of enzymes do not appear to differ significantly from the typical ligand environments of catalytic zinc in zinc metalloenzymes except for a tendency for lower coordination numbers in regulatory zinc sites. It appears that zinc binding is employed to keep some enzymes in an inactive state and that they need to be activated by removing the inhibitory zinc(II) ions, i.e. a function opposite from that of catalytic zinc (Fig. 1) . One can also argue that the composition of the active sites of many enzymes makes it necessary to control free zinc(II) ions at very low concentrations to avoid widespread zinc inhibition at active sites. Therefore, weak interactions of zinc with cytosolic proteins are thought not to be physiologically relevant and reference to free cellular zinc(II) ions as weakly or loosely bound zinc is misleading. Apoenzymes are activated by binding of zinc(II) ions to become zinc metalloenzymes (upper) .

Cellular zinc is buffered and zinc(II) ion concentrations can fluctuate and reach about 1 nM globally but it is unknown how much they can increase locally (Krezel and Maret 2006; Li and Maret 2009 ).

Without insight into the structure of regulatory sites, such sites are not accounted for in bioinformatics approaches. Ligands of regulatory (inhibitory) zinc sites cannot be readily identified in the primary sequences of proteins. The reason is that such sites often do not have the relatively short amino acid spacers between the ligands that made the recognition of signatures and prediction of catalytic and structural sites so successful. The active sites of proteins are often made from amino acids that are brought into proximity in the 3D structure but are distant in the primary structure. Thus, the recognition of inhibitory zinc sites faces the same challenges as the identification of active sites in proteins. Therefore, it is impossible to estimate the number of such sites from bioinformatics approaches but it appears that zinc/protein interactions are even more numerous than indicated by the estimate of about 3,000 human proteins.

In metalloproteinases, a fourth zinc ligand, either a cysteine or an aspartate, is employed to keep the enzyme inhibited (Springman et al. 1990; Guevara et al. 2010) . Dissociation of the fourth ligand activates the enzyme. Perhaps, a third ligand in inhibitory zinc sites acts as a similar hinge for modulating affinity and making metal association and dissociation in the cell possible.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 235, "end": 254, "text": "(Maret et al. 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 486, "end": 497, "text": "(Maret 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 498, "end": 511, "text": "(Maret , 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 757, "end": 780, "text": "(Springman et al. 1990;", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 781, "end": 801, "text": "Guevara et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Perspectives"}, {"text": "Our knowledge remains incomplete with regard to the extent of regulation of proteins by reversible zinc binding, the types of principles, the structural details, and the functional implications for metabolism and signal transduction.
