The algorithm randomly samples, in real time, the many thousands of chats, bulletin boards, and bits of message that flow dynamically through the cyberspace of the Internet. This simultaneous m\u00e9lange of signals, in the aggregate, is meaningless noise. The algorithm, by seeking key words and patterns of activity, artfully exploits this raw information to construct patterns of light, sound, and words that please human minds. The substrate of information flowing over the Internet is in constant flux so the patterns presented by Listening Post are unpredictable at the fine microscopic scale; but at the macroscopic scale of sensible experience, Listening Post is manifestly pleasing. The patterned flow of sights, sounds, and words (seen and heard) arouses associations, memories, and feelings in the mind of the viewer-which is what we call art: art, whether visual, auditory, tactile, gustatory, or verbal, is an artifact made to arouse associations, memories, and feelings. Listening Post is an artful representation of the complexity of information flowing through the Internet; Listening Post transforms the Internet's massive informational landscape into a comprehensible miniature. Two attributes of Listening Post illustrate our theme: the work feeds on information designed for other purposes and it survives by engaging our minds. ",

Information becomes a signal if you respond to the information. The meaning of the signal is how you respond to it (Atlan and Cohen, 1998) . For example, a Chinese character bears information (it is arranged in a characteristic form), but the character is not a signal unless you know how to read Chinese.

In biology, form is expressed by the characteristic structures of molecules, cells, organs, organisms, populations, and societies. Informational structures are not limited to material entities: organizations and processes through their defining regularities also fashion informational structures. An informational landscape encompasses a totality of information-material and organizational. Information expressed in biological structures is essential to life, but structure alone is not sufficient for living. Biological information is collective and reproducible-the structural information repeats itself at various scales, from molecules through societies (and beyond into human culture). The information encoded in biological structures persists and cycles; we call it development, physiology, and reproduction. But most importantly, biological structures perform functions-biological information bears meaning (Neuman, 2004) .",

Interactions mark all manifestations of biological structure-molecular through social. Meaning can thus be viewed as the impact of information-what a word means is how people use it; what a molecule means is how the organism uses it; what an organism means is what it does to others and how others respond to it; and so on over the scales life-meaning is generated by interaction (Cohen, 2000) . In summary, we can connect the three conceptsinformation, signal, and meaning thusly: A signal is information with meaning. In other words, signalling is the ability of information to elicit a response, which is the meaning of the information. Note that a signal, like information in general, is free of intentions; astrophysicists, for example, receive signals from distant galaxies, which have no interest in communicating with an astrophysicist; it is the response of the astrophysicist to the galactic radiation (meaning-making) that transforms the structure of the radiation (its information) into a signal.",

Noise can refer to a number of different situations: randomness as opposed to structured information (a scribble versus a Chinese character); information without meaning (a Greek conversation overheard by one who does not understand Greek); meaningful information in a meaningless context (across-the-room cocktail-party chatter). Noise in the generic sense proposed by Shannon is the unstructured; but noise can also refer to meaningless information that might be meaningful in other circumstances. For example, a DNA sequence composing an immunoglobulin V gene element has little meaning until the sequence is recombined with other DNA sequences to form a functioning antibody gene (Cohen, 2000) -that recombination charges the DNA sequence with meaning.",

If you are the recipient of a specific bit of information-a chat or an email directed to you, for example-then you perceive signal. But if you don't understand the language, or if you do understand the language but see intruding spam, or experience a profusion of many messages at once, then you hear only noise. (Noise too can have meaning if it makes you leave the room). The difference then between signal and noise, one might claim, is having the right reception. Or, to put it another way, the same information can be either noise or signal, depending on how you perceive it-or transmit it. Combatants may attempt to evade detection by disguising signals as noise; for example, humans encrypt secret transmissions (Kahn, 1996) and infectious agents scramble antigens (Cohen, 2000; Cohen, 2003) . The transformation of noise back into signal is part of the game; counter-intelligence can learn to break the enemy's linguistic codes; an immune system can learn to decipher a pathogen's molecular codes. In informational terms, Listening Post is a machine that transforms noisy cyberspace information into a new narrative by selecting and recombining fragments of the flux. Listening Post dynamically self-organizes, similar to a living organism (Atlan, 1987; Weisbuch and Solomon, 2002) . The Internet created a new informational landscape, a new niche, that could be sampled and exploited by Hansen and Rubin to enhance their fitness as artists in the wilds of the Manhattan art world (Fig. 2) .",

A complex system such as a cell, brain, organism, or society is complex intrinsically because of the way its parts interact and hold the system together. A complex system is also complex extrinsically because we who study it have difficulty understanding the properties that emerge from it (the biological perspective); we also have trouble fixing it (the medical perspective). Evolution. The Environment constitutes an Informational Landscape of considerable Complexity (designated by the bundles of arrows) that in the aggregate is not readily useful (note the puzzled face, ?). However, a creature with a suitable Physiology can extract useful information (a limited bundle of information) and the creature's new Phenotype is subject to Selection.

So there is no necessary correlation between complexity and fitness: No dinosaurs have survived irrespective of how complex they were (and some were very complex indeed). In fact, it seems that the dinosaurs were unfit because they were too complex to survive the environmental disruptions brought about by the earth's collision with a comet (Morrison, 2003) . Primitive bacteria have survived such calamities despite their relative simplicity (probably because of their relative simplicity). Indeed, the lowest and simplest bacteria will probably prove to be more fit for survival than we more complex humans if we both have to face a really severe change in the world environment. Extremely complex systems, like us, are extremely fragile, and so they are less fit in certain situations. The bottom line is that the quest for fitness cannot explain the rise of complexity.

The surplus copies can then safely undergo mutations, and so create modified (new), added information without destroying the untouched copies of the old information. The system thus becomes enriched; it now contains the new information along with the old information.

Listening Post arose by exploiting the new informational landscape provided by the Internet, which itself arose by exploiting other informational landscapeslanguage, computers, society, culture. Let us extend the Listening Post metaphor and say that biologic evolution proceeds through the inevitable exploitation of new informational landscapes by new or variant creatures. Evolving and evolved creatures themselves become part of an enriched informational landscape, continuously available for further exploitation by other creatures. The dynamics of evolution are the dynamics of information. Like the algorithm of Listening Post, an evolving species creates new meaning by exploiting information flowing through its environment-its cyberspace.

Complexity then has to Restart its accumulation from a lower level. The scales and the form of the curve shown here are hypothetical. A species' fitness may be quantified as the measure of time occupied by that species from its origin to its extinction. This formulation avoids the difficulties of identifying factors common to all the various species with their vastly different strategies for survival (reproduction rate, lifespan, efficiency of energy use, etc.); to quantify the fitness of a species, we merely measure its survival time. In the hypothetical Figure, we compare the fitness of a hypothetical bacterium that continues to survive for some 5 \u00d7 10 8 years compared to a hypothetical dinosaur species that survived for some 10 7 years till its extinction about 65 \u00d7 10 6 years ago.

But the informational structure of both networks, cell and Internet, is similar: Each molecule in a cell, like a chat box signal, emerges from a specific origin, bears an address, and carries a message. Our problem is that the cell's molecules are not addressed to our minds, so we don't understand them. The mind exists on a different scale than does the cell; the mind and the cell live in different informational landscapes. We are unable to directly see molecular information; we have to translate the cell's molecules and processes into abstract representations: words, numbers, and pictures. The cell looks to us like a seething swarm of molecules, large and small, that appear redundant, pleiotropic, and degenerate (Cohen, 2000) . Every ligand signals more than one receptor, every receptor binds more than one ligand; every species of molecule has more than one function; and every function seems to be carried out redundantly by different agents. Causes cannot be reduced to simple one-to-one relationships between molecules; biologic causality seems more like a complex pattern or web of interactions. The flowing patterns of subunit molecules in the cell, like aggregates of Internet signals, make no obvious sense to us, the outside observers. We stand before the cyberspace of the cell and the maelstrom of information that confronts us becomes noise (Fig. 6) . The more information we gather, the more confused we become. The flow of information generated by the living cell, viewed from our scale, is turbulence. How can we understand living matter when its complexity exceeds the ability of our minds to remember and process the mass of accumulating information? Intrinsic complexity (the organism) leads to extrinsic complexity (our confusion). The informational landscape of the cell-organism-species-society is like the informational landscape of the Internet; viewed in the aggregate it is incomprehensible noise. True, minds can be helped by computers. But understanding a cell is not to be had merely by reproducing in silico the complexity of a real cell, even if that were possible. Cataloguing the molecules and their connections to simulate the cell on a computer is a useful way to begin. But precise specification is not enough. Human understanding is not mere representation-linguistic, mathematical, visual, or auditory; understanding is the exercise of proficiency (Cohen, 2005; Efroni et al., 2005) . We understand a thing when we know how to interact with it and use it well. Thus, we understand complex information by transforming it, as does Listening Post, into a meaningful signal. We understand complexity by learning to respond to it in new and productive ways; information triggers new thoughts. Human understanding is not a static state of knowledge; human understanding is a creative process of interaction with the world (Fig. 6) . The information present in the world is a fertile landscape for growing ideas.",

Conant, president of Harvard University from 1933 to 1953 is \"an interconnected series of concepts and conceptual schemes that have developed as the result of experimentation and observation and are fruitful for further experimentation and observation\" (Conant, 1951) . Science, according to Conant, is a self-perpetuating process: scientific understanding amounts to doing good experiments that lead to more ideas for better experiments (and leading, in the case of needs, to better solutions). So to understand the cell means to turn its complexity into a metaphor that productively stimulates our minds to devise better experiments, ideas, and treatments.",

A hypothesis that has been falsified experimentally is then replaced by a modified hypothesis. The new, modified hypothesis too is tested by experimentation and its falsification leads to a third hypothesis. Thus, science advances ideally toward the truth by continuously adjusting its hypotheses through experimentation. Unfortunately, this description of science may be suitable for certain fundamental aspects of physics and chemistry, but the study of biology and other complex systems doesn't really progress that way. Living systems are just too complex to be described adequately by simple hypotheses (Pennisi, 2003) . We seem to learn much more by tinkering with them than we do by hypothecating about them. But biology aims for more than mere tinkering; we don't want merely to accumulate data; we want to comprehend essential principles about life. How can masses of complex data be transformed into comprehension?",

Our cognitive advantage over the computer is our ability to see associations, to create and use metaphors. The computer's memory is composed of precisely retrievable lists; our memory is a web of associations-our memory is not the computer's RAM. But we, unlike computers, can create art and science, and we can respond to art and science.

We have termed this two-tiered approach Reactive Animation (RA). RA emerged from our simulation of the complex development of a key class of cells in the adaptive immune system-T cells (Efroni et al., 2003) . In the first tier, we recorded basic information about T-cell development culled from some 400 research papers using the visual language of Statecharts to convert the data to a precise computer format (Harel, 1987) ; Statecharts had been developed by David Harel and his colleagues more than 20 years earlier for building and analyzing complex man-made systems (actually, Statecharts grew out of the need to coordinate the planning of a new fighter aircraft). Statecharts seems suitable to deal with biologically evolved systems and not only with systems generated by human minds; objects such as molecules, cells, and organs can be described in terms of their component parts, interactions, and transitions from state to state, which is the way we actually do our experiments and record the data. Moreover, the Statecharts formalism is modular; we can easily add new objects, interactions, and states as we accumulate information. And most importantly, we can run the system dynamically on a computer and see the outcomes in Statecharts format of any stimulation or modification of the system we care to study. Sol Efroni, at the time a student jointly supervised by David Harel and me, then added a second tier to the representation; he devised a way for the Statecharts simulation to produce and direct an animation of the action showing the T cells and other cells moving, interacting, multiplying, differentiating, or dying in the course of development in the organ called the thymus (Efroni et al., 2003) . RA makes it possible for us to cross scales-to zoom into individual cells and their component molecules and to zoom out to view thousands of cells forming the thymus as an organ, as we please. RA allows us to experiment with the animated system in silico.",

The details of RA and of T cells and thymus are well beyond the scope of the present article; but know that RA, like Listening Post provides us with a representational analogue of how we might approach seemingly incomprehensible complexity; the complexity is reduced to representations that engage the mind. RA transforms the seeming noise of a complex system into a useful informational landscape (Fig. 6) . Listening Post exemplifies how transformations of informational landscapes are at the roots of the tree of life-a tree whose arborizations include biologic evolution and human understanding. Look again at Figs. 2, 3, and 6; they represent the same processes in essence-only the labels vary. Art and science flourish when they transform old information into a narrative of new ideas that engage ever more human minds.",

He was always asking questions; he always wanted to see the latest experimental results; he always had an interpretation and a new question. Lee loved to teach as he loved to learn. The pleasure of his company was grounded in curiosity and wonder. For me, Lee was a central influence in a landscape of information that led me to explore ideas beyond the raw data of my particular field of research-cellular immunology. For me, Lee transformed experimental information into a narrative of new ideas that engaged my mind in ever evolving ways. He was my teacher as well as my friend. He lives on in all my work.

Reactive animation (RA) empowers the Statecharts simulation to generate a realistic animation of the system and allows one to experiment with the representation in silico. The animation in silico reveals emergent properties of the system and stimulates the experimenter to undertake new experiments in mundo. The new data enter the cycle of animated representation and improved experimentation. RA represents the data in a way that engages the mind.",
