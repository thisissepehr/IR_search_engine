Among many microorganisms, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and HHV-6 in particular are detectable in the great majority of tumors, likely caused by the immunocompromised status in AITL patients [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] . EBV co-infection may lead to B-cell malignancy with primary T-cell malignancy, although EBV involvement in the pathogenesis of the disease is still debated.

RHOA, TET2, IDH2, and DNMT3A mutations have been found to be associated with the disease pathogenesis [54-62]. Gene expression analyses of AITL in mouse studies showed that essentially all cases expressed elevated levels of transcripts for IL21, IL21R, and a series of genes associated with follicular helper T-cell (TFH) development and function [63] .

Because of the compatible expression of CD3, CD4, CD10, and CXCL13, AITL is thought to be the overproliferation of germinal center T-helper cells with CXCL13, which is important in B-cell recruitment and activation, likely contributing to B-cell abnormalities also seen in patients [74, 75] .

Normal NPM protein is a non-ribosomal nucleolar phospho-protein involved with pre-ribosomal particles in both small and large ribosomal subunits. The NPM gene contributes an active promoter to drive expression of tyrosine kinase anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) on 2p23, which is normally silent in lymphoid cells. The isolation of the chimeric protein led to the development of ALK1 or p80 antibody [144, 145] and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) detection [146] with expression in 55-63 % of systemic ALCLs [145, [147] [148] [149] .

Mycosis fungoides and Sezary are both T-cell malignancies with similar cytological and histological features; progression from small plaques to cutaneous tumors may lead to eventually involvement of lymph nodes and viscera. Based on SEER date, incidence of CTCL is 7.7/1,000,000 person-years [219] . CTCL is associated with a median age at diagnosis in the mid-fifties, male predominance (male-to-female ratio, 1.7:1), and a higher incidence in African Americans [220, 221] . Overall survival of CTCL was 63 months, with 1-, 2-, and 5-year survival rates of 88 %, 77 %, and 52 %, respectively [220] . CTLC consists of a diverse group of diseases. Mycosis fungoides, first described by Jean Louis Alibert in 1806, named because of the cutaneous mushroom-like appearance, was found to have involvement of lymph nodes, blood, and viscera [222] . Patients with mycosis fungoides (MF), the most common CTCL, classically present with patches, plaques, tumors, and ulcers [218] . Pagetoid reticulosis, first described in 1939 by Woringer and Kolopp, is a variant of MF and presents as localized, hypertrophic, or verrucous lesions on extremities [223] . Folliculotrophic MF is another type that presents with hair loss, known as alopecia mucinosa [223] . Sezary syndrome, first described in 1938, is characterized by exfoliative erythroderma, lymphadenopathy, and circulating diagnostic cerebriform cells, known as Sezary cells [222] . It is a rare leukemic variant with high mortality and median overall survival of 5.1 years [224] . Patients may present with pruritis as well as skin lesions on the face that can be hyperpigmented, producing lion-like faces with ectropion formation leading to ocular inflammation [218, 225] .

MF and SS were both determined to be derived from T-cells; more specifically, MF from the tissue-resident memory cells localized in the skin compared to SS from the central memory cells or regulatory T-cells, which can access peripheral blood and explains the leukemic nature of SS [225, [227] [228] [229] [230] [231] . MF histologically presents with a dense infiltrate of atypical lymphoid cells with hyperchromatic convoluted nuclei and scant cytoplasm within the upper dermis, with the epidermis containing similar cells in aggregates known as Pautrier microabscesses [223] . Pagetoid reticulosis histologically shows cytologically atypical mononuclear cells that exhibit epidermotropism with a clonal rearrangement of the beta T-cell receptor gene compared to folliculotrophic MF, which presents with alopecia because of the tumor infiltration of hair follicles with deposition of mucin [223] . Sezary described the pathognomonic feature of SS as \"cellules monstrueuses,\" monstrous cells greater in size than a polymorphonuclear leukocyte, with a voluminous, irregularly shaped nucleus occupying 80 % of the cell and around which the cytoplasm forms a thin crown. There is evidence that CTCL is caused by chronic antigen stimulation with the protumorgenic role of mast cells and macrophages in CTCL from an infectious etiology or medication [221, 224, 225, 229, 231, 232] . Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), the most frequently found leukocyte population within the tumor microenvironment, produce distinct biochemical and cytokine profiles in many types of tumors, with low IL12, high IL10, and VEGF driving angiogenesis [233] . Staphylococcus aureus has been hypothesized to be related to CTCL pathogenesis, with an association between it and CTCL, as disease improvement is noted with bacterial eradication and changes in T-cell receptor Vb consistent with superantigen stimulation [234, 235] . Although Merkel cell polyomavirus and HTLV-1 have been found not to be the causal oncogenic virus in CTCL, there is evidence for oncogenic infectious agents because infectious disease pathways are upregulated [236] [237] [238] . Hydrochlorothiazide is associated with MF, supported by recession of disease with discontinuation of the drug and recurrence with re-initiation; the mechanism is possibly from the chlorine atom dissociated by UVB to create free radicals [239] . STAT3 was found to be activated, leading to abnormal growth regulation in tumor cells and resistance against apoptosis [240, 241] . FAS deficiency as well as overexpression of TOX, PLS3, KIR3DL2, ITGB1, PDCD6, TP53, RB1, PTEN, DNMT3A, CDKN1B, MAPK1, BRAF, CARD11, and PRKG1 are also found to be molecular mechanisms responsible for acquired resistance to apoptosis and oncogenesis in CTCL [224, [242] [243] [244] [245] [246] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 295, "end": 300, "text": "[221,", "ref_id": "BIBREF186"}, {"start": 301, "end": 305, "text": "223]", "ref_id": "BIBREF188"}, {"start": 590, "end": 595, "text": "[225,", "ref_id": "BIBREF190"}, {"start": 596, "end": 601, "text": "[227]", "ref_id": "BIBREF192"}, {"start": 602, "end": 607, "text": "[228]", "ref_id": "BIBREF194"}, {"start": 608, "end": 613, "text": "[229]", "ref_id": "BIBREF195"}, {"start": 614, "end": 619, "text": "[230]", "ref_id": "BIBREF196"}, {"start": 620, "end": 625, "text": "[231]", "ref_id": "BIBREF197"}, {"start": 880, "end": 885, "text": "[223]", "ref_id": "BIBREF188"}, {"start": 1200, "end": 1205, "text": "[223]", "ref_id": "BIBREF188"}, {"start": 1654, "end": 1659, "text": "[221,", "ref_id": "BIBREF186"}, {"start": 1660, "end": 1664, "text": "224,", "ref_id": "BIBREF189"}, {"start": 1665, "end": 1669, "text": "225,", "ref_id": "BIBREF190"}, {"start": 1670, "end": 1674, "text": "229,", "ref_id": "BIBREF195"}, {"start": 1675, "end": 1679, "text": "231,", "ref_id": "BIBREF197"}, {"start": 1680, "end": 1684, "text": "232]", "ref_id": "BIBREF198"}, {"start": 1938, "end": 1943, "text": "[233]", "ref_id": "BIBREF199"}, {"start": 2201, "end": 2206, "text": "[234,", "ref_id": "BIBREF200"}, {"start": 2207, "end": 2211, "text": "235]", "ref_id": "BIBREF201"}, {"start": 2423, "end": 2428, "text": "[236]", "ref_id": "BIBREF202"}, {"start": 2429, "end": 2434, "text": "[237]", "ref_id": "BIBREF203"}, {"start": 2435, "end": 2440, "text": "[238]", "ref_id": "BIBREF204"}, {"start": 2680, "end": 2685, "text": "[239]", "ref_id": "BIBREF205"}, {"start": 2807, "end": 2812, "text": "[240,", "ref_id": "BIBREF206"}, {"start": 2813, "end": 2817, "text": "241]", "ref_id": "BIBREF207"}, {"start": 3077, "end": 3082, "text": "[224,", "ref_id": "BIBREF189"}, {"start": 3083, "end": 3088, "text": "[242]", "ref_id": "BIBREF208"}, {"start": 3089, "end": 3094, "text": "[243]", "ref_id": "BIBREF209"}, {"start": 3095, "end": 3100, "text": "[244]", "ref_id": "BIBREF210"}, {"start": 3101, "end": 3106, "text": "[245]", "ref_id": "BIBREF211"}, {"start": 3107, "end": 3112, "text": "[246]", "ref_id": "BIBREF212"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pathophysiology"}, {"text": "The miRNAs are a class of small noncoding regulatory RNA molecules that repress translation [247] . miR-150 inhibits metastasis and invasion; miR-16 induces senescence in cancer cells.

Even as therapies are targeted toward specific gene mutations and expressions of subtypes of malignancy, there are high rates of division and mutation, resulting in relapse or refractory disease. Ongoing research about the biochemical, transcriptional, histopathological, and clinical progression of the disease is crucial to arm us with better treatment options so our patients can have better choices leading to improved overall survival. Clinical trials in T-cell lymphomas are often considered the first-line therapy because existing chemotherapy regimens are not as effective or as well tolerated by patients as we aspire, highlighting the importance of basic and clinical research in aiding us to defeat these types of lymphomas while minimizing adverse side effects of toxic regimens for our patients.
