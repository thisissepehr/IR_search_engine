A high frequency of autoantibodies, particularly antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor, has recently been reported by Lindquist, Coleman and Osterland in patients with chronic pulmonary tuberculosis (28). These authors suggested that factors such as chronicity of inflammation, tissue breakdown and the adjuvant effect of mycobacteria may play a role in the production of these autoantibodies. Injection of Freund's complete adjuvant (29) has, in fact, been shown to hasten the development of Coombs positive hemolytic anemia in NZB mice. Thus, the relatively high viral antibody titers seen in tuberculosis could be secondary to an adjuvant effect of the mycobacterial infection. It is unlikely that INH, which all of these patients were receiving, contributed to the antibody response since antinuclear antibody tests were negative in all of the patients in this group.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The relatively elevated viral antibody titers observed in tuberculosis raises the question of the role of an adjuvant effect in the response of patients with SLE to viral antigens.

This possibility cannot be ruled out. However, similarly decreased antibody titers were also obtained by the HI method, which is not dependent on the complement system.
