These plants were considered a tool to study adaptation of leaves to photoassimilate accumulation at the molecular level. By differential hybridization of a subtractive library enriched for transcripts present in the transgenic plants 12 different cDNAs were isolated. By sequence analysis four cDNAs could be identified as 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate-oxidase and as three different pathogenesis-related proteins (PR-lb, PR-Q and SAR 8.2). Two cDNAs were homologous to a calmodulin-like protein from Arabidopsis and a human ribosomal protein L19 while six cDNA clones remained unknown. One of these clones (termed PAR-1 for photoassimilate-responsive) displayed features similar to pathogenesis-related proteins: Hybridizing transcripts, 1.2 and 1.0 kb in length, were strongly inducible by salicylate and accumulated in tobacco plants after infection with potato virus Y (PVY) both in infected and uninfected systemic leaves. PAR-1 transcripts also accumulated in wildtype leaves upon floating on glucose and sucrose whereas sorbitol and polyethylene glycol had no effect. Rescreening of the ppa-1 cDNA library with the PAR-1 cDNA as probe resulted in 25 hybridizing cDNAs which by homology were found to fall into three classes (PAR-la, b, c). The cDNAs coding for PAR-la and b were 90.6~ homologous on the DNA level while both were less related to the PAR-lc cDNA (70.5 ~o and 75.2 ~o homologous, respectively). One open reading frame was identified in all three PAR-1 cDNA classes. Translation would result in proteins with a theoretical molecular mass of about 20 kDa. The N-terminal amino acid sequences resemble a signal peptide which would direct the proteins to the secretory pathway. Using selective 3' hybridization probes of the three PAR-1 cDNAs it was possible to discriminate the different transcripts. Both PAR-la and PAR-lc mRNAs are induced in plants treated with PVY.",

This situation may arise when they are exposed to high light, elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 and/or when they suffer from sink limitations as under nitrogen deficiency or cold stress [34] . As a result of sugar accumulation the rate of sucrose synthesis decreases, starch accumulates and photosynthesis is inhibited. In contrast to the well studied biochemical mechanisms in response to sugar accumulation the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Systems used to cause an increase of assimilates in photosynthetically active plant cells are girdling (cold or hot wax collar, respectively) of source leaves, the removal of sink tissues and sugar feeding experiments using detached leaves, cell suspension cultures or protoplasts [6, 12, 13, 24] . All these experimental systems, however, are restricted to investigations of the short-term response to sugar accumulation. An alternative to study long-term adaptation of plant cells to elevated levels of sugars would be the use of transgenic plants.",

In addition to the expected biochemical alterations in plant metabolism caused by the E. coli transgene a number of other phenotypical changes were observed in the transgenic tobacco plants. The high sugar levels in the source leaves lead to an increase in turgor pressure by a factor of about 9 in the transgenic as compared to wild-type plants while the water potential was essentially not changed [28] . Presumably as a consequence of the elevated turgor, the mesophyll cell enlarged two-fold as compared to wild-type cells and cell walls were found to contain 14~o and 43~o more pectin and uronic acids, respectively [28] .",

RNA was isolated from ppa-l-10 plants which is the best characterized ppa-1 plant line [27] . To avoid multiple cycles of subtraction with subsequent PCR amplification as developed by Straus and Ausubel for genomic subtraction [30] , the subtractive eDNA library was made by only one cycle of subtraction with subsequent selective cloning of transcripts from ppa-1 plants (Fig. 1 ). To this end the recombinant plasmids of the original cDNA libraries made from mRNA of wild-type and ppa-1 plants, respectively, were digested with different restriction enzymes, i.e. wild-type cDNA with Not I and ppa-1 cDNA with Eco RI. The respective cDNAs were eluted from agarose gels and the wild-type cDNA fragments were then photobiotinylated and hybridized to the ppa-1 cDNA. After addition of avidin wild-type as well as hybrid cDNAs were removed by centrifugation. The remaining cDNA fragments -already enriched for ppa-1 clones -were inserted into the Eco RI restriction site of the 2ZAP II vector thereby excluding the cloning of Not I-digested wild-type cDNAs. By hybridizing the same number of plaque-forming units of the subtractive library and the original ppa-1 cDNA library with the E. coli pyrophosphatase DNA (present only in the transgenic ppa-1 plants) it was found that this procedure had resulted in a ten-fold increase of ppa-1-specific clones in the subtractive library.",

Alternatively, the water household may be perturbed (osmotic potential, water potential and resulting turgor pressure) or metabolic changes such as alterations in the C/N ratio may occur in response to sugar accumulation. Alternatively, sugars might induce a state of general stress resulting in changed levels of phytohormones which would regulate gene expression. To study whether the accumulation of PAR-1 transcripts was due to osmotic effects caused by an increase in the levels of soluble sugars, leaf discs were incubated in different osmolytes and the RNA was analysed. Sorbitol at concentrations of 80 and 250 mM (measured to correspond to 98 and 260 mmol/ kg), did not cause PAR-1 transcript accumulation in floating experiments (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and  4) . These concentrations were used as they were about equal in osmolality to 50 mM and 200 mM glucose (measured to be 84 and 247 mmol/kg, respectively). As expected, floating on 200 mM glucose resulted in the accumulation of PAR-1 transcripts (Fig. 4, lane 2) . No induction was observed after floating leaf discs on 7 ~o polyethylene glycol 6000 (Fig. 4, lane 5) . Altogether the data suggest that the induction of the PAR-1 transcripts by glucose and sucrose cannot be caused by osmotic changes alone. Glutamine used in floating experiments to perturb the cellular C/N ratio by increasing the level of amino acids did not lead to enhanced levels of PAR-1 transcripts either (Fig. 4, lane 6) .",

The three different cDNAs contained one common open reading frame which would code for a protein with a theoretical molecular mass of ca. 20 kDa. Comparisons between the putative coding regions of the three PAR-1 proteins essentially reflected the degree of similarity found on the DNA level. PAR-la and PAR-Ib proteins would be identical to 90.3 ~o while they would share only 78.1 ~o and 79~o identical amino acids with the PAR-lc pro-tein, respectively. The amino acid sequences of the proteins deduced from the open reading frames of the three different PAR cDNAs have been aligned in Fig. 6 . The DNA homology in the putative coding region of the three PAR proteins is significantly higher than in the surrounding untranslated regions (data not shown) which additionally argues for this open reading frame as being the coding region. All three PAR proteins have the same hydrophilic profile with a hydrophobic stretch of 28 amino acids at the Nterminus which resembles a signal peptide. It seems likely that the three PARs are targetted into the secretory pathway.",

To study long-term adaptation ofgene expression to sugar accumulation we used transgenic photoassimilate-accumulating tobacco plants (ppa-1) [27] as a model system. The strategy was to isolate cDNA clones by differential hybridization of a subtractive library enriched for transcript present in the sugaraccumulating ppa-1 plants. In order to avoid cDNA artifacts frequently resulting from PCR amplifications during the establishment of a subtractive library a novel strategy was employed (Fig. 1) . cDNA libraries were prepared from mRNAs of wild-type and ppa-1 plants allowing the in vivo amplification of the respective cDNAs. The eDNA library prepared from mRNA of ppa-1 plants was cut with the same restriction enzyme later used for establishment of the subtractive library. On the other hand, the eDNA of the library prepared from mRNA of wild-type plants was excluded from cloning because a different restriction enzyme was used. The exclusion of wild-type eDNA cloning allowed for only one round of subtraction with an enrichment for ppa-l-specific cDNAs by 10-fold. Thus this efficient and simple procedure eliminated the need for multiple rounds of hybridizations/subtractions and subsequent PCR amplifications.",

In ppa-1 plants which accumulate much higher levels of soluble sugars as compared to wild-type plants [27, 9] , PAR-1 transcripts also accumulated to higher levels. These correlations strongly indicate that the induction of PAR-1 mRNA may be mediated by an increase in soluble sugars in the plant cells. This assumption has further been supported by the finding that wild-type leaves floated on different concentrations of glucose and sucrose also accumulated high levels of PAR-1 transcripts (Fig. 3) . Thus the accumulation of PAR-1 eDNA by soluble sugars appears to be the cause for its isolation as a photoassimilate-responding gene.",

Thus the accumulation of at least four different PR proteins under conditions where the plant cells permanently meet high levels of sugars and osmotic stress might have been expected. However, PR proteins have attracted attention mainly for their roles in host/pathogen relationships, particularly for their possible involvement in inducing resistance against further development of virus disease in tobacco leaves. Less consideration has been attributed to PR protein function in response to other physiological conditions like osmotic stress. Nevertheless, Pierpoint et al. [22] and Ohashi and Matsuoka [18] reported on the induction of PR proteins under mannitolinduced osmotic stress. Osmotin, a protein which belongs to the group 5 of PR proteins, had first been studied in cultured tobacco cells osmotically adapted to low water potential [25, 26] . Under comparable osmotic conditions, namely floating leaves on sorbitol and PEG, accumulation of PAR-1 mRNAs was not induced (Fig. 4) . Thus the induction of PAR-1 transcripts in wildtype leaves upon floating on osmolytes cannot be solely attributed to osmotic effects. Penetrating and possibly metabolizable solutes such as sucrose and glucose (Fig. 3 ) may be required for the response.",

            "text": "The question arises how the induction of the PAR-1 mRNAs is mediated and whether there might be induction mechanisms common to other PR protein genes in physiological situations where plants accumulate photoassimilates in their cells. Hypothetically, even the induction of PR proteins by pathogens might follow the same mechanism. Viruses have been described to cause severe perturbations in carbohydrate metabolism in leaves leading to the accumulation of starch [32 and references therein] and/or soluble sugars [36, 29] . Sturm and Chrispeels [31 ] found that bacterial infection caused rapid induction of extracellular invertase which hydrolyses extracellular sucrose. Glucose and fructose may be taken up which might trigger the induction response. Sugars have also been reported to induce other stress-related proteins, such as proteinase inhibitor II [ 10, 11] , cathepsin D inhibitor and leucine aminopeptidase from potato [unpublished data] and chalcone synthase [33] . Thus, as already suggested by J ang and Sheen [8] , there might be a common mechanism of sugar sensing in the repression of photosynthetic genes and the activation of stressrelated/pathogenesis-related genes. As the induction of PAR and PR protein-specific transcripts in the ppa-1 plants might be mediated by salicylate we have determined salicylate levels in these plants. There was no difference in the levels of salicylic acid or its conjugate between ppa-1 and wild-type plants (Ph. Meuwly, J.-P. M&raux, unpublished data). This indicates that the accumulation of PR protein-specific transcripts by soluble sugars follows a salicylate-independent pathway. Other or additional mechanisms for the induction of PR proteins in the photoassimilateaccumulating plants cannot be ruled out. For instance, the accumulation of the mRNA coding for ACC oxidase might indicate a role of ethylene in the induction process. This is supported by the finding that carbohydrates stimulate ethylene production in tobacco leaf discs [21] . Current experiments are devoted to studies on the signal transduction mechanisms of stressrelated as well as photosynthetic genes in ppa-1 and other transgenic sugar-accumulating plants (manuscript in preparation).",
