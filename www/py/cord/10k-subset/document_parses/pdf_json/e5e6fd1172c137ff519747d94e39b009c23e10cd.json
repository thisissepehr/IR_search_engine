Haslam, 2004; Jetten et al., 2012) states that groups that provide us with a sense of belonging are good for health and well-being. The theoretical foundation for these beneficial effects is derived from social identity theory (Tajfel and Turner, 1979) and self-categorization theory (Turner, 1985) . A key idea of these theories is that when individuals identify with groups, they have a common perspective and coordinate their behavior with respect to group norms. This also leads to providing and receiving more social support which in turn helps developing a stronger sense of collective self-efficacy (e.g. Avanzi et al., 2015 ; see also Blecharz et al., 2014 for the mediating role of collective efficacy between motivational climate and the well-being of athletes). In addition, it has been proposed that a shared social identity serves as a basis for a more favorable interpretation of social support . In line with this notion, it has been found that social support has more positive effects if the provider and recipient of support share a social identity (Frisch et al., 2014) . Above and beyond this potential to better cope with stressors due to more support and higher self-efficacy, social identification should also lead to greater well-being because it satisfies basic human needs for belonging and affiliation, certainty, and safety (e.g. Greenaway et al., 2016; Ketturat et al., 2016) . The importance of social relationships for well-being has also been suggested by Rusk and Waters (2015) in their psycho-social system approach and by Stavrova and Luhmann (2016) who found that collective connectedness was related to a higher sense of meaning in life and vice versa. Along similar lines, Stok et al. (2014) showed that participants who identified strongly with groups with pro-health norms had higher vegetable consumption. On one hand, one would predict such positive effects of shared group identities and high identification only if the respective group is supportive and promotes healthy living norms (e.g. Sani et al., 2015) . Group membership may, on the other hand, harm well-being when the group norms prescribe unhealthy behaviors (e.g. binge drinking, see Gardner et al., 2012) , or when relations between members in a group are toxic and hostile. Steffens et al. (2017) have recently provided meta-analytic evidence that identification in organizational contexts is indeed related to people's health. Importantly, these authors also argued that identification should be more closely related to the presence of well-being rather than to the absence of stress because \"high social identification is generally construed to be a basis for experiencing positive outcomes (e.g. support, belonging, control, agency) rather than to be a basis for avoiding negative outcomes\" (Steffens et al., 2017: 11-12) .

For the latent factors of work engagement and stress, we used parceling and combined half of the items into one indicator each (i.e. two parcels for engagement and two for stress).

They identified 13 studies which provided a generalized stress training and measured resilience within 3 months of follow-up and found a moderate average effect of .37. Orzech et al. (2009) tested the effects of an intensive mindfulness intervention with 10-12 hours of training per day for 1 month and found significant increases in resilience compared to a control group.
