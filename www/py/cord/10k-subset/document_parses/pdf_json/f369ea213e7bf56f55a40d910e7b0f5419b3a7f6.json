After a review of data sets of similar registries in developed countries, the selection and modification of the basic framework were performed over 16 meetings, based on the objectives and feasibility of the registry. Results The final version of the data set was composed of 376 data elements including sociodemographic, hospital admission, injury incidence, prehospital procedures, emergency department visit, medical history, vertebral injury, spinal cord injury details, interventions, complications, and discharge data. It also includes 163 components of the International Standards for the Neurologic Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) and 65 data elements related to quality of life, pressure ulcers, pain, and spasticity. Conclusion The NSCIR-IR data set was developed in order to meet the quality improvement objectives of the registry. The process was centered around choosing the data elements assessing care provided to individuals in the acute and chronic phases of SCI in hospital settings.

We translated the RHSCIR data set dictionary into Farsi and then our expert panel independently reviewed the translation. The accessibility of the data elements of the RHSCIR was examined by experts who were aware of the clinical documentation status and the general content of medical records in hospitals of Iran. It was noted that several variables are not recorded in patients' hospital charts; therefore, patient medical records were considered as the secondary data source of the registry. Comparability of our registry data with other countries was another issue that was discussed by the expert panel.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods"}, {"text": "International data standards are recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), therefore, the International SCI Data Sets (ISCIDS) were also reviewed. At the third step, the expert panel made changes to Iranian data set of NSCIR-IR in order to accommodate our major data elements and concerns of quality of care. For example, our data set registers different time points from injury time to the time of arrival of ambulance to the trauma scene, time of arrival to hospital, or to a referral center, and time of the surgical stabilization with or without spinal cord decompression. With this design, it will be possible to identify major time delay points in our care providing system. Table 1 compares the RHSCIR data set with the two other registries [18, 19] . The RHSCIR data set includes more than 307 variables that cover quality of care [18, 20] . The RHSCIR data set has two types of minimal and extended data elements in which the minimal data set includes 200 mandatory data elements that must be recorded for all patients including those who do not consent to be part of the registry. These minimal data set includes name, family name, age, time, place and mechanism of injury, and questions which are essential for patients' treatment by care providers. The extended data elements (107 elements) are recorded only for patients who consent to be part of the registry [21] . Our expert panel reviewed the RHSCIR data elements. Some of the RHSCIR data elements were not accessible through primary data sources of the registry e.g., patient-reported or clinician-reported data, observation and measurement by the registry members. Medical records were considered as the secondary data source of the registry, however, several variables in the RHSCIR data set were also not recorded in the patient medical records. Table  2 shows the data items and variables, which we did not include in our registry ( Table 2) . According to the review of WHO and ISCIDS [22] [23] [24] , our strategic committee had considerations regarding comparability of the designed data set with international data. WHO recommends the use of standardized coding systems such as the international classification of diseases (ICD), International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI and ISCIDS for data collection to facilitate comparison between different patients, centers, and countries [22] . The RHSCIR data set and other data sets (Appendix 1) were different from the ISCIDS. Therefore, the expert panel decided was not convinced to use the RHSCIR data set due to concerns of accessibility and comparability of data in our registry with the RHSCIR data set. The expert panel concluded to use ISCIDS as the basic framework of NSCIR-IR data set. ISCIDS includes a core data set and several specialized data sets. The core data set includes 24 variables that are the minimal data required for collection for all people with SCI in acute inpatient settings [25] . There are 12 more data sets which are focused on different aspects of SCI and SCI consequences [24] . According to the registry objectives and registration process, the expert panel selected 174 data items from ISCIDS.

Also, some clinical assessments such as mobility or pain assessment with specialized tools (e.g., Berg Balance Scale, Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs, Douleur Neuropathique 4) are not part of the routine assessments in Iran. Also, rehabilitation and assistive devices are not provided in a specialized manner to the patients in the acute phase. Instead, rehabilitation and support services are available at the level of long-term care. Although, there is connection between the acute care system and long-term care system; there is a lack of communication and information sharing between care providers working in the two levels of Iran health care system. Patients normally work as messengers, carrying information between the two levels. In contrast, Canada has a robust information technology infrastructure. There are multiple database and reporting systems at all of the health care services levels. These include the Hospital Morbidity Database and Discharge Abstract Database for ambulatory and hospital care, National Rehabilitation Reporting System for rehabilitation care, NTR for trauma care, Continuing Care Reporting System, and Home Care Reporting System for continuing and long-term care [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] .
