Viral matrix proteins establish the link between outer shell and capsid core of enveloped viruses and bring together these parts in the virus assembly step. Moreover, matrix proteins frequently determine the place where the assembly step occurs. In influenza A viruses two M proteins are located on RNA7 of the negative-stranded, segmented RNA virus. The M1 protein functions as a typical matrix protein, while M2 exerts multiple tasks in the early and late phase of virus infection. M2 tetramers form an ion channel and in the early phase of virus infection M2 serves for the release of viral nucleocapsid by acidification of endosomes. In the late phases, M2 prevents premature activation of newly synthesized HA [1] and -in concert with M1-contributes to virus budding and morphology. The involvement in virus exit has been assigned to the cytoplasmic tail of the protein [2] [3] [4] . Influenza viruses bud from lipid rafts and for this event the components of the viral envelope (haemagglutin HA, neuraminidase NA, M2) and the RNA containing protein complex (vRNP) must come together to form infectious virus [5] [6] [7] . Interestingly, the endosomal sorting machinery (ESCRT), which has been involved in late steps of other viruses, does not contribute to influenza virus budding [6, 8] . Accordingly, other routes and gates have been suggested for the transport of influenza proteins and virus assembly/budding [5] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1013, "end": 1016, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1173, "end": 1176, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1177, "end": 1180, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1181, "end": 1184, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1412, "end": 1415, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1416, "end": 1419, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1420, "end": 1423, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1585, "end": 1588, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1589, "end": 1591, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1717, "end": 1720, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "In several previous investigations caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a multifunctional, raft-resident membrane protein has been linked to the virus replication of retroviruses HIV-1 and amphotropic mouse leukemia virus, rotavirus and respiratory syncytial virus [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Interestingly, a contribution of Cav-1 to HA transport has been reported for influenza virus infected MDCK cells [14] . In a recent investigation of the enveloped \u03b3-retroviruses budding from lipid rafts we showed that caveolin-1 (Cav-1) interacts specifically with the MLV retroviral matrix protein in the Gag precursor, suggesting that Cav-1 serves in positioning the Gag precursor at lipid rafts [13] . Not surprisingly, Cav-1 is incorporated into MLV virions released from mouse NIH3T3 [13, 15] . Subsequently, competition and inhibition experiments provided evidence that Cav-1 modulates MLV retrovirus production [13] . Taken together, these findings pointed to a general contribution of Cav-1 in virus replication strategy and opened the possibility that other virus families budding from lipid rafts may co-opt the functions of Cav-1. In our search for cellular/viral targets a database screen for Cav-1 binding sites notably revealed that structural proteins like matrix proteins of other viral families, e.g. Orthomyxoviridae with influenza A virus as a representative, exhibit regions of homology with a consensus motif for Cav-1 binding (Cav-1 binding domain, CBD) (Wirth, M, unpublished) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 248, "end": 251, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 252, "end": 256, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 257, "end": 261, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 262, "end": 266, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 267, "end": 271, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 387, "end": 391, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 672, "end": 676, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 763, "end": 767, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 768, "end": 771, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 892, "end": 896, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1450, "end": 1473, "text": "(Wirth, M, unpublished)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "To address the biological relevance of the interplay of Cav-1 with influenza proteins we performed inhibition experiments with a dominant-negative Cav-1 mutant, knock-down by Cav-1 RNAi as well as competition experiments with M2 fusion proteins.

Expression efficiency Analysis using a paired t-test (n = 9) revealed that the 1,5 to 3 fold reduction in titres compared to MDCK control cells is statistically highly significant (p > 0.001). could be monitored easily, as endogenous and transfected, recombinant caveolins differ in their mobility in SDS-PAGE due to a C-terminal myc-tag (Fig. 2 bottom) . Cav-1 appeared in two isoforms, with molecular weights of 21 and 24 kD, respectively [22, 23] . Expression efficiencies ranged from 7-29% (SD) and 20-50% (wt-Cav-1) with respect to endogenous Cav-1 level. Provided that the myc-tag does not interfere with Cav-1 antibody detection and assuming a 1:1 interaction of SD mutant and endogenous Cav-1, sufficient competitor amounts should be available in successfully transfected cells. Next, transiently transfected MDCK and mock-transfected MDCK cells were infected with influenza A/PR/8/34 virus one day after transfection. 24 h later supernatants were used for titre determination (Fig. 2 top) . To account for between-session-variations in cell culture, values were normalized to virus production from infected wt MDCK (100%). To exclude sensitivity of influenza infection to the actual transfection process, pEGFP-N1 transfected control cells were infected with PR8 virus in a control experiment. Strikingly, SD mutant expression in MDCK cells interfered with human influenza A virus replication and decreased the viral titres on average 1.6 fold to 62% of titres from wild-type MDCK (average of three independent experiments, standard deviation = \u00b1 15,95). Compared to processed EGFP control cells, virus yield from Cav-1 wt-or SD-transfected MDCK cells was reduced considerably, which excludes that effects observed on virus production are derived from the transfection process (data not shown). This strongly suggests that interference with Cav-1 function in MDCK cells interferes with human influenza A virus replication. Interestingly, over-expression of wild-type Cav-1 also diminished influenza virus production, since viral titres reached only 56% \u00b1 10.53 compared to non-treated MDCK (n = 3). Thus, surplus exogenous Cav-1 interferes with endogenous Cav-1 function, too.

Cav-1 binds to various cellular proteins like membrane receptors, soluble or membrane-associated molecules [24] as well as several viral proteins and exerts functions in localisation, transport and cellular signalling (Table 1 ). Signalling is preceded by phosphorylation of Cav-1, which initiates events leading either to activation of specific signalling pathways [21] or maintenance of signalling-competent, yet inactive complexes [24] . A specific, lumenal domain termed caveolin scaffolding domain (CSD, aa 82-101) which resides adjacent to the region of membrane insertion, is responsible for specific protein binding in the vast majority of cases [24, 25] . Two consensus sequences have been identified in phage-display experiments and in the primary structure of Cav-1 binding partners which were termed caveolin binding domains (CBD) [26] . CBDs have been recognized in cellular [24] and viral proteins ( Table 1 ). The consensus sequence comprises a run of 3 aromatic residues (W, F, Y) separated by a characteristic spacing (\u03a6xxxx\u03a6xx\u03a6; \u03a6x\u03a6xxxx\u03a6; where x stands for any amino acid and \u03a6 for W, F, Y). Our screening for CBDs identified putative binding regions in HA, PB2 and M2 of influenza A virus. Especially, a region in the M2 channel protein turned out to be highly conserved among human influenza A viruses (Fig. 3B ). The putative CBD overlaps with a loop/helical domain immediately following the M2 transmembrane region at the lumenal site of M2 (Fig. 3A) . The CBD surrounds Cys 50, which is palmitoylated and faces the membrane allowing for insertion of the palmitoyl residue into the lipid bilayer. Thus, the CBD would be located favourably for interaction with the Cav-1 scaffolding domain [27, 28] . Strikingly, compared to M2 of A/PR8/34 as a reference the CDB core motif (positions F47, Y52, F55) and immediately adjacent amino acid residues are completely conserved in 8 M2 sequences available for the pandemic influenza virus of swine origin A/2009 (H1N1) (Fig. 3C) . Furthermore, motif conservation is observed in a former H1N1 strain appearing in 1977, but homology is restricted to the aromatic core and to a lesser extent to adjacent residues. Surprisingly, in M2 of influenza A/ 1918 the CBD motif is not conserved, as its third aromatic residue phenylalanine is changed to leucine, a residue commonly found in the M2 of avian influenza A viruses at that position (G.-V. Hemg\u00e5rd and M.

In the first series of experiments, polyclonal anti-Cav-1 antibodies were used to pull-down Cav-1 complexes from lysates. Precipitated complexes were probed for the presence of M2 after Western Blot and immunostaining. In these experiments, the Cav-1 antibodies clearly pulled down a complex that contained a M2 from pEP24c transfected MDCK cells (Fig. 5B, a) or the M2 fusion protein from pM2PR8-EGFP transfected MDCK or NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 5B, b) as well as infected MDCK cells (Fig. 5B, c left panel) . In the second experimental setting, vice versa, monoclonal anti-EGFP antibodies were used to precipitate M2 binding partners and a rabbit anti-Cav-1 antibody was used to probe for the presence of caveolin (Fig 5B, c right panel) . These types of experimental settings identified M2 complexed with Cav-1 and vice versa in both cell lines, NIH3T3 and MDCK. Thus, the results suggest that M2 has the capability to interact directly or indirectly with caveolin-1 in different cell lines. With respect to the type of interaction, it is notable, that caveolin-1 as well as M2 have been reported to bind cholesterol via cholesterol specific recognition domains [30, 31] . This prompted us to investigate, whether cholesterol is involved in the M2/caveolin-1 interaction. For that purpose methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD) was used to deplete cell lysates from cholesterol before co-immunoprecipatation (Fig. 5B b and 5c) .

Database searches and subsequent peptide pull-down assays in combination with co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggested binding of caveolin-1 to M2 presumably to a motif in the M2 protein fitting the CBD consensus [26] . Strikingly, the motif is shared in M2 of nearly all human influenza A viruses. M2 functions within the viral life cycle as a viroporin with proton channel activity that is crucial in the entry phase [1] and as a maturation cofactor in virus budding. The cytoplasmic tail is implicated in M1 binding and facilitates virus assembly and production [2] [3] [4] 35] . Furthermore, Schroeder et al. showed that avian M2 is a cholesterol-binding protein [31] . Most avian influenza A viruses contain two cholesterol recognition motifs (CRAC I, CRAC II) in close vicinity to the transmembrane domain in the cytoplasmic region of M2 [31, 36] . Thus, cholesterol-binding and palmitoylation in combination with a short transmembrane region may direct M2 to the raft periphery in membranes and may promote clustering and merging of rafts which is then followed by the pinching-off of avian viruses [31] . [30] . Notably, to some degree Cav-1 binding to M2 is sensitive to the cholesterol depletion (this investigation). Preliminary results of mutagenesis as well as localization experiments indicate a certain role of the M2-CBD in M2 transport and localization (unpublished observations). Taken together our results demonstrate, that Cav-1 exerts an influence on influenza A virus replication and data imply that the binding of Cav-1 to the matrix protein M2 is involved. However, which function or pathway in MDCK cells actually is triggered via Cav-1 interaction with M2, remains to be determined.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 188, "end": 192, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 412, "end": 416, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 618, "end": 621, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 764, "end": 767, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 768, "end": 771, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 772, "end": 775, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 776, "end": 779, "text": "35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 866, "end": 870, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1043, "end": 1047, "text": "[31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1048, "end": 1051, "text": "36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1305, "end": 1309, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1312, "end": 1316, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The appearance of the aggressive bird influenza (H5N1), the 2009 outbreak of a pandemic influenza (H1N1) of swine influenza origin, and the recent occurrence and rapid dissemination of oseltamivir-resistant human influenza strains are motors that have accelerated the search for new antiviral targets and agents within the last time [37] [38] [39] . The investigation of cellular mechanisms involved in 'early' and 'late' viral processes and the identification of cellular actors provides a means to interfere with viral strategies. With this respect, the observed Cav-1/M2 interplay may represent a new, conserved target for e.g. therapeutic intervention with circulating and newly emerging strains of human influenza A virus. Thus, appli-cation of high-throughput screening of compound libraries will follow target identification and may result in a new antiviral agent, as exemplified for a cellular target involved in the late retroviral life cycle [40] .
