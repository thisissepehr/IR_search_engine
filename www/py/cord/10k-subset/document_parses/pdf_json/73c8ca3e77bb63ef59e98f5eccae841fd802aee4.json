It is regulated by infant immunity, which in turn develops and is shaped by exposure to the microbiota 3, 4 . Intestinal lymphoid tissues require the intestinal microbiota for normal development, and exposure to commensal and pathogenic organisms sets the tone of the systemic and mucosal immune system for the long term. These early interactions have a substantial impact on the development of metabolic and immune-mediated disorders 5 . There is also emerging evidence in mice and humans for microbiota dependent modeling of local immunity and the subsequent response to infection or vaccination [6] [7] [8] . Understanding the complex interaction between the microbiota and immune responses during infancy therefore has potentially important implications for vaccine development as well as prevention of immune-mediated disorders.",

Oral vaccines against poliovirus, rotavirus, and cholera are all substantially less immunogenic and effective when given to children in LMICs 17 . This phenomenon has prolonged polio eradication by limiting vaccine effectiveness 18 , and is limiting the benefits from the global scale-up in access to oral rotavirus vaccines 19 . However, recent studies of biomarkers of EE in children at the time of immunization have had mixed findings, with different biomarkers showing positive, negative or no association with oral poliovirus or rotavirus vaccine immunogenicity 20 . Several other mechanisms may also contribute to poor oral vaccine immunogenicity in LMICs, including interference by high titers of antigen-specific transplacental or breastmilk antibodies. However, withholding breastfeeding does not improve oral poliovirus or rotavirus vaccine response [21] [22] [23] [24] , and neonatal immunization when transplacental antibody titres are at their highest has in general resulted in comparable levels of seroconversion to doses administered later in life 25, 26 .",

These infants were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of the effect of the antibiotic azithromycin on EE and OPV immunogenicity 31 . As primary outcome, we reported that azithromycin treatment had no effect on seroconversion after OPV, despite reducing the enteric bacterial pathogen load and fecal biomarkers of EE. Instead, infection with enteric viruses (enteroviruses and rotavirus) was associated with seroconversion. We now report on extensive immune profiling of these infants at the time of immunization, including mucosal homing immune cells in peripheral blood, plasma cytokines and acute-phase proteins, leukocyte counts, and fecal biomarkers of inflammation. We use a statistical learning approach to identify immune markers measured at the time of vaccination that predict OPV immunogenicity.

Viral pathogens were more prevalent among those infants who failed to seroconvert to OPV (prevalence of at least one viral pathogen was 63.9% vs. 45.6%, Fisher's p = 0.002), as previously reported 31 . However, detection of any pathogenic virus in stool was not correlated with any of the immune parameters after FDR correction.

Combining all measurement modules for 126 infants with complete data we were able to predict seroconversion with a median accuracy across all cross-validation samples of 58% (interquartile range (IQR): 50-69%; Fig. 3a ). This compares with 50% accuracy expected by random choice assuming a priori equal probabilities of seroconversion or not. The most important measurement modules contributing to this modest predictive accuracy were enteric pathogens (enterovirus in stool), ex vivo flow cytometry measurements (regulatory CD4+ T cells expressing CCR9), neutrophil and the (correlated) total leukocyte count and plasma cytokines (Fig. 3c) .

            "text": "Our study provides insight into the ecology of the gastrointestinal tract and the developing immune system in infants in a low-income setting with a high load of bacterial and viral intestinal pathogens. Perturbing the intestinal microbiota with azithromycin allowed us to overcome some of the difficulties with complex association data in observational studies and reveals distinct bacteria-associated changes in infant immune status. To analyze these complex data including over 30 infection and 50 immune parameters per child we used a systems biology approach to identify immune signatures that could predict OPV immunogenicity. We did not find a distinct immune phenotype that was strongly associated with OPV seroconversion or shedding among the immune parameters that we measured. As previously reported, infection with enteroviruses at the time of vaccination was more common among infants who failed to seroconvert to OPV 31 , but these infections were not associated with a distinct immune signature in peripheral blood or stool (Fig. 2b) . Combining all measurements in a machine-learning (random forests) analysis, OPV seroconversion could be predicted with an out-of-sample accuracy of 58% (IQR: 50-69%), only a modest improvement over the 50% accuracy expected by chance. Apart from enterovirus infection, the variables with the highest importance in this analysis were the numbers of CD4+ T cells homing to the small intestine (CCR9+), particularly CD4 + FOXP3 + (regulatory) T cells, and also circulating leukocytes, in particular neutrophils, and the fecal biomarker of enteropathy \u03b11-antitrypsin. This is potentially suggestive of a local intestinal inflammation that inhibits OPV immunogenicity. CD4+ regulatory T cells have a well-established role in intestinal inflammation-they home towards the inflamed gut and can resolve intestinal inflammation 32 . They are also involved in the early antiviral immune response to mucosal infection in mice 33 However, without mucosal tissue samples, it is difficult to conclude their role in the response to OPV in these infants. Shedding of poliovirus after vaccination was strongly correlated with seroconversion, and markers of inflammation were somewhat raised among infants who did not shed poliovirus after vaccination as seen for seroconversion (although these differences were not significant in univariate analyses after FDR correction). However, shedding of OPV after immunization was not predicted with any degree of accuracy above that expected by chance on the basis of the immune parameters that we measured.",

It will be important to determine how our findings in this population translate to other settings, such as in sub-Saharan Africa, where oral vaccine immunogenicity is also compromised. We deliberately enrolled infants without detectable serum neutralizing antibodies to serotype 3 poliovirus, but these infants were previously exposed to trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine and may have developed an immune response that was not detectable in blood or that had waned by the time of enrollment. It is therefore possible that our population included both na\u00efve and immunologically primed infants with a potential impact on the subsequent immunogenicity of OPV. However, we were not able to distinguish such a population and analysis of infant vaccination history and seroprevalence at screening for eligibility was consistent with a simple hypothesis of a small, independent probability of vaccine failure per dose of earlier vaccine 40 .",

Infection with enteric viruses and changes in gut-homing regulatory T cells showed a modest association with OPV immunogenicity. Further work would be required to investigate this possible association, ideally including mucosal samples. It is clear that intestinal homeostasis among these infants is skewed towards an inflammatory state that maintains health in the presence of multiple intestinal pathogens. On average, each infant had >2 pathogen targets detected in stool using TAC but only 2% had diarrhea at enrollment 31 . We do not fully understand the mechanisms responsible for the development and maintenance of this inflammatory environment, although they are likely to reflect the integration by the infant immune system of multiple signals from intestinal viral and bacterial pathogens and commensals 3, 41 . Further investigation of these mechanisms in humans and in animal models may identify pathways that could be targeted by coadministered drugs or adjuvants that enhance the immune response to oral vaccines.",

For each analysis we report the median accuracy from a 10-fold cross-validation using 20 random forests for each fold. Variables were ranked by their importance in the random forests analysis and the top eight most important variables plotted in a correlation network with links between pairs of variables shown if their Spearman rank correlation coefficient was greater than 0.2. Variable importance was assessed by the mean decrease in the Gini coefficient resulting from their inclusion in the random forest model.",

The boxes correspond to the interquartile range for the accuracies in the prediction set, with the solid line showing the median and the whiskers extending to the 10th and 90th percentile. The dashed line indicates expected accuracy if a random choice were made. The top eight most important variables that predict c seroconversion and d study arm in one best fit full random forests model are shown as correlation networks. The color of the circle around each variable indicate whether they were positively (green) or negatively (red) associated with seroconversion or azithromycin respectively. The size of each network node indicates the strength of correlation with the outcome and the color indicates whether the variable describes pathogens in stool (orange), EE biomarkers (blue) ex vivo T-cell and total leukocyte count data (pink), or plasma cytokines (green) (as for a and b).
