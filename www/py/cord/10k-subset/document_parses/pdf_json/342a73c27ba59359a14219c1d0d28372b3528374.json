A study of 112 patients from Nigeria reported higher incidence in children and adults in the age group between 35 and 40 years [4] . In an analysis of pyomyositis in HIV-negative patients from the USA, the mean age of presentation was 43 years in patients with underlying medical condition and 23 years in patients with no underlying medical condition [5] . A study from Spain showed a bimodal distribution with peaks between 30-50 and 60-70 years [9] . Median age of presentation of our patients was 37 years. Thus, primary pyomyositis reported from tropical countries like India is being increasingly seen in older age groups like those seen in temperate climates.

Computerized axialtomographic scanning is preferred for the diagnosis of an abscess of the iliopsoas muscle as it provides better delineation of muscle structure. The features of an abscess of the iliopsoas muscle on a computerized axial-tomographic scan include asymmetric enlargement of the muscle belly associated with a focal area of low attenuation or gas formation. Enhancement of the rim of the wall of the abscess after intravenous injection of contrast medium is another useful sign. Our study findings showed similar changes on CECT imaging.
