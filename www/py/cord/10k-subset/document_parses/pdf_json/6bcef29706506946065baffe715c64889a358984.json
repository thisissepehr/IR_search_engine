Furthermore, all study subjects received active influenza vaccination. We believe our active surveillance was adequate, as many cases of ILI were evaluated, and subsequent testing revealed a substantial incidence of infection with respiratory syncytial virus and seasonal influenza virus types A and B. Potential effects of variability between countries in active surveillance performance were minimized by the randomization process. Overall influenza incidence rates in each group had overlapping 95% CIs, which does not support the proposition that the adjuvant groups experienced an unqualified general reduction in risk. Nevertheless, despite the low number of influenza cases, the relative VE of the adjuvanted vaccine after 2 doses was higher than estimated and was sufficient overall to reach a definitive conclusion. However, the low case numbers led to wide CIs for relative VE estimates and increased the uncertainty regarding our exploration of secondary end points and subanalyses by age, although point estimates for relative VE were the same for subjects younger and those older than 3 years. This study commenced during the 2009-2010 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic in expectation of a third pandemic wave, and it was not considered ethically acceptable to include a placebo group. Even though the study could not provide absolute VE values, these can be estimated using other sources from the literature. If an absolute VE of 40% for 2 doses of nonadjuvanted H1N1 vaccine is assumed (from the study by Vesikari et al [5] , against mainly influenza A[H3N2]), the estimated absolute VE for Ad2 in our study is 86%; if an absolute VE for plain H1N1 antigen of 59% is assumed (efficacy estimate from the same influenza A[H1N1] antigen in a quadrivalent formulation) [15] , the estimated absolute VE for Ad2 is 90%, which is consistent with short-term vaccine effectiveness estimates (86%-100%) reported in case-control studies involving children and adults who received 1 dose of H1N1-AS03 [16] [17] [18] .
