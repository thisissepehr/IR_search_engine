After FDR procedure, ABCB1 gene was no longer associated with parasitemia rates. r A significant interaction effect between SLCO2B1 genotypes and treatment over time for parasitemia elimination rates during treatment (p FDR = 0.002) was observed. On day two SLCO2B1 AA carriers showed higher parasitemia elimination rates than GG genotype carriers (AA vs AG: p = 0.076; AA vs GG: p = 0.002; and AG vs GG: p = 0.262). Considering Cohen's classification, this interaction presents a large effect size (d = 0.89). r SLCO1A2 and SLCO1B1 genes were associated with gametocytemia rate over treatment time in generalized estimating equation analyses adjusted for age, gender, co-medication, parasitemia baseline level, CYP2C8 genotypes and genetic ancestry.
