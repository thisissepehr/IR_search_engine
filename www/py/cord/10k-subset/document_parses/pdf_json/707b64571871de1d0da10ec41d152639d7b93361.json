            "text": "Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) is one of the main pathologic features of bronchial asthma, which is largely attributable to enhanced contractile response of asthmatic airway smooth muscle. Although b2 adrenergic receptor agonists are commonly used to relax airway smooth muscle for treating AHR, there are side effects such as desensitization of long-term use. Therefore, it is desirable to develop alternative relaxant for airway smooth muscle, preferably based on natural products. One potential candidate is the inexpensive and widely available natural herb saponins of Dioscorea nipponicae (SDN), which has recently been reported to suppress the level of inflammatory factor IL-17A in ovalbumin-induced mice, thereby alleviating the inflammation symptoms of asthma. Here, we evaluated the biomechanical effect of SDN on IL-17A-mediated changes of cultured human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) in vitro. The stiffness and traction force of the cells were measured by optical magnetic twisting cytometry (OMTC), and Fourier transform traction microscopy (FTTM), respectively. The cell proliferation was evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetry, the cell migration was measured by cell scratch test, and the changes of cell cytoskeleton were assessed by laser confocal microscopy. We found that the stiffness and traction force of HASMCs were enhanced along with the increases of IL-17A concentration and exposure time, and SDN treatment dose-dependently reduced these IL-17Ainduced changes in cell mechanical properties. Furthermore, SDN alleviated IL-17Amediated effects on HASMCs proliferation, migration, and cytoskeleton remodeling. These results demonstrate that SDN could potentially be a novel drug candidate as bronchodilator for treating asthma-associated AHR.",

            "text": "Respiratory function can be understood as a series of interactive biomechanical processes involving the structural elements of the lung, particularly the airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) playing a decisive role in regulation of pulmonary airway impedance. From the microscopic viewpoint, the cytoskeletal structure of ASMCs is a highly complex and dynamic system with specific micro/nanodynamic characteristics. In addition, the morphology and phenotypic transformation of ASMCs are affected by mechanical factors in the external microenvironment [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . This inspires researchers to focus on the cellular biomechanics of ASMCs in the study of obstructive airway disease such as asthma. For example, previous study has shown that the biomechanical behavior of ASMCs can be altered by localized external stress stimulation, which may directly contribute to excessive ASMC contraction and thus airway stenosis associated with asthma [6] . As ASM dynamics is considered as the common final pathway of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) that is characteristic of asthma, ASMC biomechanics may be a key to the understanding of the underlying mechanism of AHR and the pathogenesis of asthma.",

            "text": "For clinical treatment of asthma, the current therapy mainly uses glucocorticoids and b2 adrenergic receptor agonists to inhibit airway inflammation and dilate bronchial airways, respectively. However, these drugs are known for adverse side effects, in particular about half asthmatic patients are not responsive to them, and many become desensitized after long-term use of b2 agonist treatment [11] . Therefore, there is a need to develop new bronchodilator drugs for the treatment of asthma. An approach is to screen potential drug agent from natural materials such as herbs used in traditional medicine. Accordingly, pharmacopeia records suggest that natural plant rhizome Dioscorea nipponicae has antitussive, expectorant, and anti-inflammatory effects, and its active ingredient is saponins of Dioscorea nipponicae (SDN). Previous study has demonstrated that SDN can reduce airway tissue remodeling by inhibiting IL-17A in murine model of chronic asthma [12] . Since airway remodeling mainly manifests as structural changes of ASMCs including hyperplasia and hypertrophy that contribute to irreversible airflow obstruction and persistent AHR, SDN appears to be an effective agent to alleviate AHR through regulation of IL-17A-mediated human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) structural changes [13] . It is not clear, however, whether SDN could affect HASMCs' biomechanical behaviors through mediation of IL-17A as a therapeutic agent for treating AHR.",

To test this hypothesis, we aimed to evaluate the changes of biomechanical behaviors including stiffness, contraction force, and mobility of ASMCs cultured in vitro in the absence or presence of IL-17A followed by SDN treatment. Such investigation may not only reveal how IL-17A mediates airway contractile function at the cell level but also provide first evidence to demonstrate the potential of SDN as a novel bronchodilator drug agent for treating AHR in asthma. The culture medium of smooth muscle cell was supplemented with 2% fetus bovine serum and 1% smooth muscle cell growth supplement in the equilibrated, poly-L-lysine-coated culture vessel at 37 C under 5% humidified CO 2 . Culture medium was replaced every three days until the cells grew to approximately 70% confluence, and then every other day until the cells grew to approximately 90% confluence. Subsequently, cells were passaged with 0.25% trypsin and 1 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid every 3 to 5 days, and cells from passage 2 to 8 were used for experiments.",

When the cell grew on the base gel ( Fig. 3(a) ), the distribution map of fluorescent beads (0.2 mm diameter) differed from that at the base gel due to intracellular tension ( Fig. 3(b) ). The instrument software recorded the distributions of these two states and calculated the cell traction force based on the elasticity theory (Fig. 3(c) ). After exposure to IL-17A (10 ng/mL) for 24 h, the cell traction force was increased significantly as compared to the vehicle control (379.32694.97 Pa versus 281.84689.82 Pa, **P < 0.01). However, when the cells were treated with SDN at concentration from 0.001 to 1 lg/mL following the IL-17A treatment, the IL-17A-induced HASMCs' traction force gradually decreased to be either significantly lower than that of IL-17A alone at 0.1 and 1 lg/mL SDN (IL-17A \u00fe 0.1lg/mL SDN versus IL-17A, *P < 0.05, IL-17A \u00fe 1 lg/ mL SDN versus IL-17A, **P < 0.01), or comparable with that of vehicle control (276.60679.80 Pa versus 281.84689.82 Pa for IL-17A \u00fe 1 lg/mL SDN versus vehicle, P > 0.05). Figure 4 displays the effect of IL-17A alone or together with SDN on HASMCs proliferation, migration, and cytoskeletal organization. The proliferation of HASMCs was measured by MTT assay. As the concentration of IL-17A increased from 0.001 to 1000 ng/mL, the cell absorbance (OD) also increased consistently and became significantly greater as the IL-17A concentration reached 0.1 ng/mL (*P < 0.05) and beyond (0.1$100 ng/mL, *P < 0.01), indicating that IL-17A could enhance the proliferation of HASMCs in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig. 4(a) ). However, when the cells were treated with SDN after being stimulated with 10 ng/mL IL-17A, the cells responded with decreasing absorbance (OD) as SDN concentration increased from 0.001 ng/mL (*P < 0.05) to 0.01$1 ng/mL (*P < 0.01), suggesting that SDN could alleviate the IL-17A-mediated proliferation of HASMCs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4(b) ).",

This stereoscopic arrangement ensures that the contractile tension is evenly distributed from the cell to the extracellular matrix. After treatment with IL-17A, the intensity of stress fibers increased significantly (Fig. 4(e) ), which could in turn cause change in cell contractility. After treatment with SDN, IL-17A-induced increase of intracellular stress fibers was alleviated and diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm, and the geometric arrangement of cells was changed back (Fig. 4(f) ).

Therefore, it is important to evaluate changes in mechanical properties of ASMCs in relation to pathogenesis as well as treatment of AHR airway diseases such as asthma. The two important indexes of cell mechanical properties are the stiffness and the traction force, which were used to quantify the changes of mechanical properties of ASMCs under the action of IL-17A and SDN in this study. According to the results of cell stiffness measured by OMTC and the cell traction force measured by FTTM, IL-17A treatment could increase the stiffness and traction force of the HASMCs, but subsequent SDN treatment could reverse these changes in a dose-dependent manner. It has been shown before that the IL-17RA/RC receptor subtypes are expressed on bronchial airway smooth muscle, and IL-17A binding can induce the enhancement of the contraction response of smooth muscle ring tissue, which plays an important role in the underlying mechanism of AHR [10, 21] . The key finding of this study is that SDN could inhibit the effect of IL-17A on the mechanical properties of ASMCs, suggesting that SDN may be a potential drug agent for treatment of IL-17A-mediated AHR. Although IL-17A is a well-known pro-inflammatory cytokine and SDN is a natural product that has long been widely used in traditional medicine for anti-inflammatory purposes, it is the first evidence, to our best knowledge, to show that SDN could counteract IL-17A in regulation of the mechanical behaviors of ASMCs. Such a novel function of SDN to relax contracted HASMCs and its well-known function in inhibition of airway inflammation may be complementary to each other in asthma therapy to result in greater efficacy.",

As specific to asthma pathogenesis, studies have shown that ASMCs from asthmatic patients proliferate much faster than their nonasthmatic counterparts [23, 24] . On the other hand, it has been shown that enhanced migration of ASMCs, particularly the directional migration toward the airway intima induced by various cytokines, inflammatory mediators and growth factors, is equally important in contributing to greater ASM mass and AHR in asthma [25] .",

Among them, the microfilaments (filamentous actin protein structure also known as F-actin) are the most important for facilitating mechanical behaviors of the cell including maintenance of cell morphology, control of cell deformation, and movement as well as regulation of cell signaling. In particular, the reorganization of cytoskeletal microfilaments has been confirmed as the basis of contractile responses in airway smooth muscle in AHR [27] [28] [29] . Our results showed that IL-17A had an obvious effect on the formation and remodeling of F-actin in HASMCs, showing increased F-actin intensity in the presence of the cytokine. However, all the IL-17A-induced changes of Factin structures in the HASMCs were found to be alleviated by SDN under the given conditions of drug treatment. These results further demonstrate that SDN indeed reduced cell stiffness and traction force of the HASMCs by inhibiting the reorganization of F-actin structures induced by IL-17A, but it remains to be confirmed whether SDN actually acted on HASMCs by specifically antagonizing the IL-17A receptor.",

            "text": "In summary, HASMCs were shown to undergo cytoskeletal reorganizations in response to stimulation with IL-17A, which in turn led to increased stiffness and traction force generation of the cells. These changes may all contribute to the excessive contractile function of ASMCs manifested as the characteristic AHR in asthma. However, we found that SDN could alleviate all the IL-17A-mediated changes in HASMCs, particularly the changes of biomechanical behaviors such as cell stiffness and traction force generation, as well as the cytoskeletal organization such as F-actin stress fiber formation, suggesting that SDN may be a potential drug candidate as bronchodilator for treating IL-17Aassociated AHR.",
