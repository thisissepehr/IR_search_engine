In our method, after analysing the characteristic features of the excitation pulse positions of the ITU-T G.723.1 and G.729A speech codec, we design a novel and effective covert communication channel by finely modulating the codes of excitation pulse positions of the above two codecs in line with the secret information to be hidden. To improve the embedding capacity of the proposed method, we also use all the odd/even characteristics of pulse code positions to conduct information hiding.

Obviously, covert communication based on information hiding can be widely used for the secret transmission of confidential information of institutions, organizations, enterprises, and individuals. Especially in the recent application scenario of the key data sharing of the novel coronavirus (i.e. COVID-19) outbreak information, covert communication based on information hiding can not only realize the safe sharing of related information, but also effectively protect the privacy of related personnel and even personal safety. Next, we discuss the design of a stealthy communication experiment system for the safe and secret sharing of key sensitive data. The structure diagram of the hidden communication experimental application system based on information hiding is shown in Fig. 6 . It can be seen from Fig. 6 that the system is composed of a sending terminal, a sending agent, a virtual covert channel, a receiving agent, and a receiving terminal (similar to the receiving terminal). The sending terminal and the receiving terminal are served by various types of devices participating in the sharing of confidential information, such as personal/portable computers, mobile phones, and handheld digital devices. These devices need to have the conditions or capabilities to deploy sending/receiving agents. The sending and receiving agents implement the processing procedures of the information hiding algorithm proposed in this paper. They are responsible for embedding the confidential information that needs to be sent or shared into the voice carrier, or extracting the confidential information embedded in the voice carrier. The virtual hidden channel is realized by transmitting the encrypted voice data on the public shared channel. The process of sharing or transmitting secret sensitive information is as follows: First, the sender terminal calls the sending agent to embed the confidential and sensitive information in ordinary speech coded data (such as G723.1 or 729A); then, the sending agent hands over the encrypted speech coded data The public channel is then sent to the receiver; finally, the receiver terminal calls the receiving agent to present the confidential information hidden in the voice-encoded data, thereby completing the secure sharing of confidential and sensitive information.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 979, "end": 985, "text": "Fig. 6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1008, "end": 1014, "text": "Fig. 6", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Design of application scenario system for sensitive information covert transmission"}, {"text": "In this paper, we have developed a covert communication channel by steganography on common compressed speech codec such as G.723.1 and G.729A. We present four steganography algorithms based on different strategies. It is experimentally demonstrated that the proposed steganographic method can obtain high levels of imperceptibility, security, and robustness with sound hiding capacities. As for G.723.1 speech codec, we can achieve a data hiding capacity of 3.1%, 5.6%, or 10.6% (secret information transmission rate of 166 bits/s, 300 bits/s or 566 bits/s) results in 5.7%, 9.4%, or 12.5% reductions in PESQ scores, respectively, while for G.729A, we can also obtain a data hiding capacity of 2.5%, 3.75%, or 5% (secret information transmission rate is 200 bits/s, 300 bits/s or 400 bits/s) results in \\ 5.4%, \\ 8.1%, or \\ 16.8% reductions in PESQ scores.

The information hiding algorithms studied in this paper can be widely used in various application scenarios for the confidential transmission of confidential information, such as protecting the important sensitive information of various institutions or the privacy of personal financial and health information. Although the algorithms proposed in this paper have good comprehensive performance and efficiency, the capacity of information hiding still does not meet the needs of high-speed covert communication, and the contradiction of increasing hidden capacity and increasing privacy has not yet been fully resolved. In the future, we will focus on applications of the methods developed in this work. In addition, we will further investigate the possibility of performing steganography based on other speech codec parameters so as to discover even more effective steganography approach in the area.
