METHODS: Prospective study of 32-36 weeks' gestational age infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. Each infant had two Sarnat examinations performed at <6 h, one by a gold standard (GS) study investigator, and the second either by (a) another GS examiner or (b) an attending physician (28 examiners), all blinded to clinical variables. Agreement was calculated using kappa (k) statistics. RESULTS: One hundred and two (9, fetal acidosis) infants underwent a modified Sarnat examination. Among GS examiners, agreement was excellent (k > 0.8) except for Moro, while among all examiners agreement was very good (k > 0.7) except for both Moro and tone. Subgroup analysis at 32-34 weeks' showed fair/poor Moro compared to excellent agreement at \u226535 weeks. Increasing abnormalities correlated with acidosis (r = \u22120.6, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Strong inter-rater reliability for the modified Sarnat was observed except for tone and Moro in preterm infants. Experience of the examiners resulted in improved reliability in tone, while for the Moro agreement improved only beyond 35 weeks.

However, the neurologic assessment of the newborn is challenging due to transient effects of delivery, need of resuscitation, general anesthesia, and/or the presence of other associated conditions, such as respiratory distress. 1, 2 These challenges are further amplified in preterm infants who can present with a complex amalgam of asphyxia and secondary maturational disturbances. [3] [4] [5] The Sarnat stages of encephalopathy in the first week after birth was established and validated to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes following a hypoxic-ischemic injury in neonates at term. 6 It has since been modified to allow enrollment of newborns with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in studies of neuroprotective therapies within 6 h of life. The modified Sarnat is the most commonly used neurological examination for determination of the severity of encephalopathy and eligibility for hypothermia therapy. While the modified Sarnat examination has been extensively tested in the evaluation of term newborns at risk for encephalopathy, no prior studies have tested its inter-rater reliability in preterm infants. 7 As with any tool/method, investigation into the reliability of the modified Sarnat neurological examination performed on late and moderately preterm infants at risk for brain insult is warranted. 8, 9 Recent retrospective reports of increased prevalence of HIE in late and moderately preterm infants are difficult to interpret since the neurological examination criteria were not defined and the exam could be compounded by maturation of the nervous system.

The detailed analysis of encephalopathy as required by the modified Sarnat examination is limited by what can be elicited in a neurologic examination at each level of gestational maturation of the infant. 19 Late and moderately preterm infants have developmental differences in primitive reflexes, tone, and posture that are controlled by the degree of prematurity and thus can confound the interpretation of the Sarnat score. Flexor posture in the lower extremities is present by 32 weeks' gestation but only gradually evolves in the upper extremities until present at \u226536 weeks' gestation. 20 Similarly, the Moro reflex may be incomplete until 37 weeks' gestation since the anterior flexion of the upper extremities may be absent in younger gestational age infants. Pupillary reaction to light begins to appear at 30 weeks' gestation but is not present consistently until approximately 32-35 weeks' gestation. Findings from this study confirm that the developmentally regulated categories can be difficult to evaluate in the preterm infant. [19] [20] [21] [22] The present study shows that, when using the modified Sarnat score in preterm infants, there is less agreement in the less mature infants of \u226434 weeks' gestation. This phenomenon was seen irrespective of the experience of the examiners and is consistent with reports using other neurologic scales. [20] [21] [22] [23] In those studies, when compared to term infants, late and moderately preterm infants had less mature performances in several items, including less axial tone with substantial head lag, less flexor tone, and less spontaneous activity. In addition, provider and knowledge-based diversity can contribute to subjectivity when performing the neurological exam. 24 In order to overcome clarity issues and ensure reliability, examiners should be trained by certified GS examiners who ideally have participated in evidence-based studies utilizing that assessment, as was done in the current study. While the focus on the examination to be performed by trained and certified attending physicians added to the rigor of the study, it is important to note that study findings are likely to overestimate agreement if compared to a clinical setting outside of standardized protocols. Another issue affecting the assessment of reliability is the lower frequency of preterm infants with fetal acidosis necessitating a Sarnat examination. For instance, at our institution the experienced GS examiners screen approximately 50 term infants with fetal acidosis yearly with a neurological examination, which is 10-fold higher than the average of 3-5 per year born with fetal acidosis at 32-35 weeks' gestation who require such examination.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 475, "end": 477, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 862, "end": 864, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1313, "end": 1317, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1318, "end": 1322, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1323, "end": 1327, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1328, "end": 1332, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1631, "end": 1635, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1636, "end": 1640, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1641, "end": 1645, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1646, "end": 1650, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2007, "end": 2009, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Moro and tone assessment are included in the majority of neurological assessments for use in this population and are the most used clinically.

In contrast, agreement in the Moro reflex was poor and no improvement was seen between the experienced study investigator or GS examiners and the group of certified neonatologists.
