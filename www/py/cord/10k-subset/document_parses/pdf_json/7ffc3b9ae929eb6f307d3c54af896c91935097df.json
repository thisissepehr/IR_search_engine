The mean age of these children was 7.5\u00b13.5 yr. Contact history was positive only in 22 (26%) cases. High grade fever was the most common symptom, followed by cough and rhinorrhea. Twenty-nine (34%) patients had an underlying co-morbid condition. Of the 34 patients who underwent chest radiography during evaluation, 18 children (52.9%) had findings consistent with lower respiratory tract infection. Antiviral therapy was initiated in 76 patients. Hospitalization was required in 30 (35.3%) children. Risk factors for hospitalization included underlying co-morbid condition, respiratory distress, vomiting, wheezing, diarrhea, hypotension and infiltrates/consolidation on chest radiograph. Mean length of hospitalization was 131+76 hours, irrespective of underlying disease. Three children developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and died.",

Antiviral drugs were administered to most patients (89.4%), but such therapy was started more than 48 hours after the onset of illness in a majority of the patients. The interval between the onset of symptoms and the initiation of oseltamivir was longer in children who were hospitalized than those who received ambulatory care. This is similar to that reported in other series [15, 16] . Due to non-specific symptomatology children who had not received oseltamivir timely had high probability of hospitalization, thus adding to the impression of delayed administration of oseltamivir in hospitalized children. Secondly, being a tertiary care hospital, children referred from outside with severe illness (without obvious cause) were tested only after getting admitted to our hospital; there was a time gap for administration of oseltamivir after onset of illness.",

Whereas diarrhea or vomiting have occasionally been reported in children during peak periods of seasonal influenza [18] , these symptoms were reported in 10-27% of patients in our study. Incidence of diarrhea was reported to be between 8-20% and vomiting in 10-40% in children infected with swine origin H1N1 infection [9, 16] .

Recovery was very fast in all the patients irrespective of underlying illness, which is in contrast to other studies.

We evaluated only patients with confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza virus infection, so the group may not be representative of patients who may not have been tested.
