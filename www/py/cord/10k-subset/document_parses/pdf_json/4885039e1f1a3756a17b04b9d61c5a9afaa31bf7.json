            "text": "mal or high oxygen delivery rate has been increasingly proposed as a haUmark and a risk factor in critical illnesses. We hypothesized that as fas as an adequate oxygen delivery is provided, oxygen consumption, when determined by indirect calorimetry, is not dependent on oxygen delivery in critically ill patients whereas calculated oxygen consumption is associated with artefactual correlation of oxygen consumption and delivery. Design: oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption and their relationship were analyzed prospectively. Metabolic data gained from both measured and calculated methods were obtained simultaneously before and after volume loading. Setting: the study was completed in the intensive care unit as part of the management protocol of the patients. Patients: 32 consecutive patients entered the study and were divided into 3 groups according to a clinical condition known to favour oxygen supply dependency: sepsis syndrome, adult respiratory distress syndrome and acute primary liver failure. Intervention: the rise in oxygen delivery was obtained by colloid infusion (oxygen flux test) performed in hemodynamically and metabolically stable patients. All were mechanically ventilated. No change in therapy was allowed during the test. Measurements and results: oxygen consumption was simultaneously evaluated by calculation (Fick Principle) and direct measurement using indirect calorimetry. Oxygen delivery was derived from the cardiac output (thermodilution) and arterial content of oxygen. Oxygen supply dependency was considered while observing an increase in oxygen delivery greater than 45 ml/min, m 2. Irrespective of patient's clinical diagnosis and outcome, measured oxygen uptake remained unaltered by volume infusion whereas both oxygen delivery and calculated oxygen consumption increased significantly. Arterial lactate level>2mmol/1 and measured oxygen extraction ra- failed to identify oxygen supply dependency when measured data were considered. Conclusion: analysis of oxygen uptake, when measured by indirect calorimetry, failed to substantiate oxygen supply dependency in the vast majority of the critically ill patients irrespective of diagnosis and outcome. Mathematical coupling of shared variables accounted for the correlation between oxygen delivery and calculated oxygen consumption.",

Sepsis [1, 3] and adult respiratory distress syndromes [2, 4] are the commonest conditions whose course is complicated by the emergence of MOF. Abnormalities of DO 2, VO2 and their relationship have been postulated as one of the major mechanisms leading to MOF during critical illnesses such as sepsis syndrome, septic shock and ARDS [5] [6] [7] . In these latter conditions, imbalance between oxygen demand and delivery has been observed either by an inappropriately low DQ as a result of a decrease in cardiac output, hemoglobin concentration and arterial oxygen saturation or by an abnormality of tissue oxyten extraction in the setting of increased oxygen demand and normal or high oxygen delivery [5, 8] . These mechanisms were believed to underly cellular hypoxia, dysfunction and eventually death [5] .",

            "text": "However, studies on DO2/u 2 relationship remain controversial. A pathologic supply dependency of oxygen uptake in which VO2 varies directly with DO2 over a wide range of oxygen supply even at normal or high delivery rates has been reported in sepsis syndrome and ARDS [5, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Its features included increased oxygen demand and defective peripheral oxygen extraction with increased critical DO2 and the accumulation of blood lactate as a marker or anaerobic metabolism and pathologic dependence [8] . Importantly this pathologic dependence as well as elevated blood lactate levels were believed to increase the mortality in sepsis syndrome and ARDS by reflecting occult cellular hypoxia [5] . Other investigators, who measured VO2 by indirect calorimetry either in ARDS or sepsis syndrome, failed to reproduce this pathologic dependence [16, [19] [20] [21] and/or disputed its prognostic significance [20, 21] . These discrepancies could be explained by differences either in interventions used to alter DO 2 (oxygen \"flux test\"), or in the patient population with regard to diagnosis, delay before study and metabolic status. Most importantly in the vast majority of these studies [5, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] , VO2 and DO2 were calculated, which may explain the dependence of VO2 on DO2 by mathematical coupling of the shared variables between DO2 and VOz, i.e. cardiac output and arterial oxygen content [22, 23] .",

VO 2 was calculated (VO2c) by the use of the Fick equation: VO2c = CO\u2022 10 Measured VO 2 (VO2m), VCO 2 and respiratory quotient (RQ) were obtained simultaneously from continuously performed gas exchange measurements by an automatic metabolic monitor (Deltatrac/Datex | which has already been validated [27, 281 . Each reported value was the mean of 3 successive measurements obtained immediately after the 3 determinatious of CO, and during blood sampling. This metabolic monitor is based on the open gas circuit principle and consists of a paramagnetic oxygen-sensor, a CO 2 analyser using the infrared absorption technique and a flow meter. The use of the Haldane transformation gives the monitor the opportunity to measure only the expired gas flow, the inspired gas flow being deduced on the assumption that 0 2 and CO 2 are the only 2 gases to be exchanged into the lung. Consequently, there is an increase in the VOzm measurements errors at high FIO 2 levels [29] . This is minimized by the use of a differential paramagnetic oxygen sensor so that the results remain accurate until an FIO 2 level of 75% [28, 30] . The accuracy of VO2m was regularly assessed by burning a known quantity of ethanol. The increase of VO2m was considered significant if > 6o70 [27, 28] . 9 Oxygen extraction ratio was derived from both the indirect (EO2c) and direct (EO2m) methods of VO 2 evaluation: EO2c = VO2c/DO 2 = AVD/CaO2; EO2m = VO2m/DO 2. 9 Arterial lactate level (normal value<2 mmol/l) was measured in the arterial blood using an electrochemical method (Roche-Kontron; Basel, Switzeriand). 9 Values of VOzm, VO2c, VCO 2 and DO 2 were adjusted for the total 2 2 body area (ml/min.m).

Critical insults such as sepsis syndrome, ARDS and acute liver failure are known risk factors for the development of MOF [1 -3] . Although the pathogenesis of MOF is still a matter of speculation one hypothesis is that during the resuscitative phase alterations in microcirculatory physiology and local activation of cellular elements secondary to the initial injury mediates inadequate microcirculatory flow, defective peripheral oxygen extraction and occult tissue hypoxia that preceed the transition to overt organ dysfunctions [6, 31, 32] . Several investigators have pointed out that abnormalities in the relationship between DO2 and VO2 could unmask this oxygen debt [5, 17] . Pathologic oxygen supply dependency in which VO2 varies in the same direction with a change in DO2, even during hyperdynamic conditions, has been increasingly reported to underly cellular hypoxia in sepsis syndrome and ARDS and was suggested to herald MOF and to predict patient's outcome [5] . Thus, this abnormal dependence of VO2 on DO2 above the normal critical level of oxygen supply and its correlatives, defective oxygen extraction ability and increased blood lactate levels should porten obvious pathophysiologic, prognostic and therapeutic implications.",

Hence patient's outcome was unrelated to the relationship of VO 2 to DO 2. Several factors may account for the discrepancies between previous reports [5, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] and this study. Differences in methods used to change DO 2 could affect the behavior of VO2 due to the own drug-induced changes in metabolic rate and oxygen demand. This metabolic effect could account for a primary change in VO 2 and secondary compensatory change in DO 2 to match oxygen demand. Differences in patient population with respect to clinical diagnosis, hemodynamic status and microcirculatory condition at the time of evaluation are of paramount importance. Most studies on DO2/VO 2 relationship have been conducted in patients with sepsis syndrome and ARDS [5, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Since sepsis is a common cause and complication of ARDS these two conditions are closely associated [1, 2] . Whereas the effect of human sepsis on critical DO 2 is unknown, experimental animal models demonstrated that sepsis syndrome increased the critical DO E by increasing oxygen demand and by diminishing the ability of tissues to extract oxygen [33, 34] . Microembolisation, loss of autoregulation of microcirculatory blood flow and endothelial cells injury were mechanisms proposed to account for this extraction defect [31] . Therefore, inhomogeneous groups of patients, particularly in the ARDS population, might have critical-ly influenced the relationship between DO 2 and VO 2 depending on the coexistence of sepsis, the magnitude of peripheral extraction defect and the actual oxygen demand. In addition, in the setting of a dysfunctional microcirculatory environment, which is a common condition in many of these patients, \"normal\" dependence of VO 2 on DO 2 could have relied on an inadequately treated hypodynamic state and truly supply-driven ischemia as a result of hypovolemia or myocardial dysfunction. Therefore, to overcome these potential confounding variames care was taken in this study to assess the presence of oxygen supply dependency in homogeneous groups of patients with regards to clinical diagnosis, to alter DO 2 by an identical intervention and to provide all the patients with an adequate cardiac output.",

The studies which addressed the issue of the dependence of VO 2 on DO 2 in sepsis syndrome and ARDS consistently demonstrated pathology supply dependency whenever VO2 was calculated [5, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . In contrast, when oxygen uptake was measured directly, VO 2 was usually not correlated with DO 2 either in sepsis syndrome or ARDS [16, [19] [20] [21] . In this study VO2 was systematically evaluated by calculation and direct measurement before and after volume loading. Whereas calculated data almost consistently led to pathologic supply dependency, the latter was supported by direct measurement of VO 2 in only 17~ of the tests.",

Similarly, Ronco et al. [21] reported that increased lactate did not predict dependence of measured VO 2 on DO 2 in patients with ARDS. Since blood lactate levels reflected the balance between peripheral production and hepatic elimination, elevation of blood lactate might not always be indicative of tissue hypoxia. In particular the 9 patients with arterial lactate > 2 mmol/1 at the time of evaluation had severe liver dysfunction due to either primary hepatic failure or as part of MOE So defective hepatic clearance rather than hypoxic driven-peripheral overproduction accounted for hyperlactacidemia in the subgroup. Further explanations for the lack of correlation between blood lactate and oxygen supply dependency include the inability of tissues to receive or use oxygen [36] and inactivation of pyruvate deshydrogenase which would increase both lactate and pyruvate in the same proportion without resorting to tissue hypoxia [8] .",
