To describe the current nature of this disease in the UK, data was gathered on patients with clinical pneumonia from whom Streptococcus pyogenes was cultured principally from blood or other relevant normally sterile sites. In the Harrogate and Northallerton districts of North Yorkshire, pneumonia accounted for nine (20%) cases and a quarter of all deaths in a complete sequence of 45 patients with Streptococcus pyogenes bacteraemia detected during the 16-yearperiod 1981-1996. An analysis is presented of those cases together with eight recent cases from counties York, Durham and Isle of Wight during 1995-1997. Of the total 17 cases, nine occurred in women and eight in men; the age range was 30-92 years. The organism was isolated from blood culture in 15 (88%) patients. Eight (47%) patients died, five within 1 day of hospitalisation. Fourteen (82%) cases occurred in the winter months October to March, including all the fatal cases and all eight in which a clinical 'viral' prodrome was observed. Predisposing medical or surgical conditions were present in 65% of the patients. Major complica-tions included septicaemia, pleural reaction, shock, pulmonary cavitation, osteomyelitis and metastatic abscesses. Seven serotypes of Streptococcus pyogenes were encountered, with M-type 1 predominating (the cause in 60% of cases).

At that time outbreaks were reported in military camps, particularly when streptococcal upper respiratory tract infection or scarlet fever was also prevalent [4, 5] . In these youthful populations, the rate of bacteraemia was low; case fatality rates also fell to low levels after the advent of antibiotics [5] . According to recent accounts, pneumonia has occurred in outbreaks in homes for the elderly and as sporadic infection in adults in the community, often in patients with medical risk factors such as diabetes or immunosuppression [7, 8] . A heightened mortality rate for this infection has been noted in older patients and in those with bacteraemia [6] . With the resurgence of serious forms of Streptococcus pyogenes infection in many parts of the world during the last 15 years, several authors have noted an increased occurrence of previously rare forms of this infection, including pneumonia and necrotising fasciitis [7, 9] ; streptococcal toxic shock syndrome has also occurred in some patients with these diseases [8, 10, 11] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 63, "end": 66, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 177, "end": 180, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 181, "end": 184, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 185, "end": 188, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 189, "end": 192, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 306, "end": 309, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 470, "end": 473, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 474, "end": 476, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 619, "end": 622, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 852, "end": 855, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 856, "end": 858, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 971, "end": 974, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1244, "end": 1247, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1248, "end": 1250, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1343, "end": 1346, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1347, "end": 1350, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1351, "end": 1354, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Streptococcus pyogenes pneumonia often features a rapid onset of dyspnoea and fever with a predominant symptom of chest pain, and there is a high rate of pleural effusion and empyema [5, 6] ; other complications include bacteraemia and necrotising pneumonia [3] leading to abscess and extending infection.

In view of the likely contamination of expectorated sputum with streptococci from the throat, no systematic analysis or review was made of patients yielding Streptococcus pyogenes from this specimen during the period of the study.

However, during influenza epidemics Streptococcus pyogenes has remained a relatively rare cause of secondary bacterial pneumonia [2] . The marked seasonal variation in occurrence of the disease noted in this and other reports is consistent with the concept that infection is often secondary to viral infections featuring a winter peak. It was notable that 11 of 15 (73%) of our typed strains were of the lower Mnumber types of Streptococcus pyogenes; such strains have been associated more frequently with respiratory infections than those affecting the skin [15] , the latter often having complex T-typing patterns and, because they were detected later in the historical study of streptococci, generally having been allocated higher numbers in the numerical sequence of M-types.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 139, "end": 142, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 143, "end": 145, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 432, "end": 436, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 568, "end": 571, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 998, "end": 1002, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results and Discussion"}, {"text": "We found a high rate of Streptococcus pyogenes bacteraemia (88%), but our study was retrospective and based partly on a review of the records of blood culture and culture of other normally sterile yet infected sites, an approach that would naturally emphasise the most serious cases.

If bacteraemia is infrequent in this disease, as was thought to be the case earlier in this century [4, 5] , our ascertainment is likely to underestimate the occurrence of Streptococcus pyogenes-associated pneumonia, particularly in its less severe forms, and it would be difficult to extrapolate accurate incidence/prevalence figures from the data.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 531, "end": 534, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 535, "end": 537, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results and Discussion"}, {"text": "The overall mortality rate in our study was high (47%), and a fatal outcome was seen in a high proportion of those infected with the currently prevailing M-type 1 streptococcal strains, including several younger patients with few, if any, predisposing medical conditions.

All three patients in our study with documented leucopenia at admission died of the infection, adding weight to the suggestion of others [12] that this could be an adverse prognostic sign. As described recently by other authors [3, 8, 11] , we encountered two patients in whom Streptococcus pyogenes pneumonia was accompanied by toxic shock syndrome. In one, toxic shock syndrome occurred in association with radiologically demonstrated bilateral basal pneumonia and pneumothorax, and in the other, who had necrotising pneumonia with cavitation, the organism was isolated from blood and sputum cultures (both patients were infected with Mtype 1 isolates). In the former patient and in a second with radiologically proven lower lobe pneumonia yielding the organism from bronchial aspirate and postmortem lung tissue, the clinical course was complicated by the development of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Bacterial pneumonia and adult respiratory distress syndrome can co-exist, as we believe occurred in these cases. In the other cases in this report, a diagnosis of pneumonia apparently was readily established based on the clinical and investigational findings.
