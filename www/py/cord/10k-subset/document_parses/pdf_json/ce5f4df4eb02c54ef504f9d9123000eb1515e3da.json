In general, about 90% of influenza-associated deaths, from respiratory and circulatory diseases, occur in the age group 65? years, and about 1% in the age group\\50 years. This information underscores the major impact of the 2009 pandemic on the age group \\50 years, and the importance of targeting the correct population for influenza vaccination programs. Deaths related to seasonal influenza were negligible among people\\50 years, and although some countries recommend vaccinating this group, it should be emphasized that the vaccine will not have a significant impact on mortality; rather, it will have an effect on morbidity, preventing other age groups from being infected with the disease, and an economic impact (this group includes the working force of a community).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conflict of interest"}, {"text": "Excess influenza associated mortality 403", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conflict of interest"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Mortality associated with influenza and respiratory syncytial virus in the United States", "authors": [{"first": "W", "middle": ["W"], "last": "Thompson", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": ["K"], "last": "Shay", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": [], "last": "Weintraub", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2003, "venue": "JAMA", "volume": "289", "issn": "", "pages": "179--86", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Influenza-associated mortality in Hong Kong", "authors": [{"first": "C", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Wong", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": ["P"], "last": "Chan", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Hedley", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Peiris", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2004, "venue": "Clin Infect Dis", "volume": "39", "issn": "", "pages": "1611--1618", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Respiratory syncytial virus infection in elderly and high-risk adults", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Falsey", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Hennessey", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Formica", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Cox", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": ["E"], "last": "Walsh", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2005, "venue": "N Engl J Med", "volume": "352", "issn": "", "pages": "1749--59", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Impact of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus on mortality in England and Wales from", "authors": [{"first": "K", "middle": ["G"], "last": "Nicholson", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1975, "venue": "Epidemiol Infect", "volume": "116", "issn": "", "pages": "51--63", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "Influenzaassociated morbidity and mortality in young and middle-aged women", "authors": [{"first": "K", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Neuzil", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": ["W"], "last": "Reed", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": ["F"], "last": "Mitchel", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Griffin", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1999, "venue": "JAMA", "volume": "281", "issn": "", "pages": "901--908", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF5": {"ref_id": "b5", "title": "First estimation of direct H1N1pdm virulence.
