Methods: This is a non-randomized short-term cross-over trial in which 12 pediatric patients with asynchrony (auto-triggering, double triggering or non-triggered breaths) were enrolled. Four sequential 10-min periods of data were recorded after 20 min of ventilatory stabilization (wash-out) at each of the following settings: baseline PS with the ventilator settings determined by the attending physician (1-PS b ); PS after optimization (2-PS opt ); NAVA level set so that maximum inspiratory pressure (P max ) equaled P max in PS (3-NAVA); same settings as in 2-PS opt (4-PS opt ). Results: The median asynchrony index was significantly lower during NAVA (2.0 %) than during 2-PS opt (8.5 %, p = 0.017) and 4-PS opt (7.5 %, p = 0.008).
