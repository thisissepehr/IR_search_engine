In this population, current guidelines recommend treatment of RSV infection in those at high risk of disease progression and death with either aerosolized or systemic ribavirin [2] .

            "text": "We believe the conclusions presented in this study should be taken in the following context. Previous data recommending the use of ribavirin in HSCT patients with RSV infection showed a significant benefit when used specifically in high-risk patients [2] [3] [4] . It is unclear whether a benefit exists with its use in low-to moderate-risk patients. In this study, 15% of the population studied were classified as high risk, whereas the majority of patients (85%) were classified as low to moderate risk. Thus, while the conclusion revealed no difference in overall mortality rates when using oral or inhaled ribavirin, this may primarily be due to the inclusion of low-to moderaterisk patients who may not have benefited from ribavirin treatment at all. Moreover, when outcomes were stratified by immunodeficiency scoring index (ISI), it was found that the small proportion of high-risk patients included in the study had similar mortality rates whether they received oral or aerosolized ribavirin. It should be noted that the total number of patients in the study classified as high risk was only 18 (12 of whom received aerosolized ribavirin and 6 of whom received oral ribavirin). With a total of only 18 high-risk patients, the study may be underpowered to detect a meaningful difference between treatment groups in this subset of patients. In addition, the application of the ISI, developed originally for allogeneic HSCT recipients, in a study population made up of a large proportion of autologous HSCT recipients (38%) may introduce error in the accuracy of risk stratification of these patients [5] . We are not aware of any validation of the ISI in autologous HSCT recipients.",

With the significant increase in the cost of aerosolized RBV ($30 000 per day), a randomized controlled trial of oral vs aerosolized RBV for the treatment of RSV in HCT recipients is unlikely to be undertaken [2] . Owing to financial restrictions, many institutions, including ours, adopted oral RBV as an alternative therapy for RSV infection in HCT recipients. With all of the limitations of any retrospective study in mind, we aimed to identify any signal of worse outcomes after the switch of formulations occurred in our center [1] .",

However, we acknowledge that the number of high-risk patients was limited in our study [2] and the previous study [3] ; thus, our analysis may have been underpowered to detect differences in outcomes with aerosolized or oral RBV in this subset of patients. On the other hand, Shah et al [3] demonstrated a notable benefit in the moderate-risk group as well, where treatment with RBV reduced LRTI rates from 23% to 11% (risk ratio, 2.1 [95% confidence interval, .9-4.6]). Thus, we believe that there is a role for antiviral therapy in moderate-risk patients, and this is typically more practical with the oral than with the aerosolized formulation of RBV. Regardless, our data did not detect any signal of worse outcomes with oral therapy, and in fact the 90-day mortality rate was numerically higher in the aerosolized group (58%) than in the oral group (33%) [1] .",
