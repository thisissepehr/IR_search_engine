            "text": "The intrinsic problem of fast imaging in MRI is the fact, that a two-dimensional entity (the image) has to be reconstructed from the intrinsically one-dimensional MRI-signal. This requires the consecutive m easurement of n x n data points in order to acquire all data points for reconstruction o f the n x n pixels of an image. Since spatial encoding is performed using switched magnetic field gradients, the imaging speed is strongly dependent on the speed of gradient. State-of-the-art gradient system s (25 mT/m am plitude, 2 0 0 -6 0 0 \u03bc sec risetime) reduce the switching time in fast examinations using sequences like ERI, single shot-RARE, GRASE or Burst-imaging to 10% of the total imaging time or less. Further improvements in gradient performance will then lead to only insignificant decreases in imaging time. A conventional spin-echo o r gradient-echo image requires about 2 -3 s pure acquisition time. According to a basic theorem of signal theory, the signal-tonoise (S/N) scales with the square root o f the acquisition time. This means, that an image with 50 ms acquisition tim e will have a 7 -8 -fo ld low er S/N. This illustrates that the final barrier for fast imaging is S/N rather than gradient speed. In general, the reduced S/N is com pensated by lower spatial resolution. It is therefore not surprising, that most applications of fast imaging are functional rather than morphological. Imaging approaches, which use prior knowledge in order to reduce the number of datapoints to be acquired promise further reductions in imaging time. Apart from so-called keyhole imaging, non-Fourier approaches like singular value decomposition (SVD)-techniques have been demonstrated to be able to lead to further reductions in imaging time by a factor o f 5 -1 0 fo r repetitive measurements on the same volum e of interest. \" High speed\" MRI does usually not refer to an exact time limit for data acquisition and will be discussed in this clinical overview in term s of 'lim ecritical\" examinations that became available or crucially optim ised by recent hardware improvement. Aim o f this lecture is to sum marize current state of related methodology (f-MRI, perfusion and diffusion imaging) in view o f clinical applicability and to highlight its diagnostic yield. Functional MRI to study cortical activation has raised considerable interest am ongst radiologists and neuroscientists. The greatest advantage of echoplanar technique consists in better anatomical coverage and higher tem poral resolution, the first being more im portant fo r patient studies. The m ost evi dent clinical application is the mapping of brain functions to guide surgical planning. W ith more clinical experience F-MRI will also offer an objective way to document neurological o r neuropsychological deficits in difficult to assess patients including com atous patients and infants. To w hat extent activation studies carry prognostic information for individual patients, however, needs further evaluation. Echoplanar imaging allows additional hemodynamic (perfusion) and diffusion assessment without exceeding tolerable total examination times, even in crit ically ill patients. Primary role for both techniques is the early delineation of stroke and possible identification of tissue at risk. If larger patient studies replicate data from animal studies, MR will become an indispensable tool for individual therapy tailoring in stroke units. Tum or characterisation as well as depiction of transient cytotoxic edema or altered perfusion in neurodegenerative diseases further extend capabilities of MRI beyond imaging structural abnormalities.",

            "text": "High speed imaging in the cardiovascular system is dearly needed because cardiovascular structures undergo rapid motion resulting in image degradation, and because MR-angiography requires relatively long acquisition times. The new strong gradient systems now available on MR imagers substantially improve the capabilities of cardiovascular MR. GRE, ERI and hybrid sequences all have been designed fo r the purpose of evaluating the cardiovascular system. W hile ERI sequences work in principle, their introduction into daily practice is hampered by imaging artifacts unique to ERI data acquisition. ERI techniques seem suitable to image cardiac morphology, wall distortion and function. EPI-MRA techniques have also been explored and will likely evolve into clinically useful imaging protocols, while the most im portant and elusive task: MRA of the coronary arteries has yet to be solved. Other pulse sequences, making use o f the fast gradient systems, have had more immediate impact on cardiovascular imaging. These sequences are used to evaluate perfusion and other function param eters in the heart, but most notably, the use o f very fast GRE techniques in conjunction with a con trast media bolus yields excellent angiogram s of the thoracic and abdominal vessels in a breath-hold. This technique is quickly becoming the superior MR angiographic technique. 5 High speed MRI o f the abdom en and the m usculoskeletal system J.L. Bloem, M. Wasser, H.J. van der W oude, J. Doornbos; Leiden/NL Fast SE (FSE) and GRE in combination with various artefact reduction tech niques have proven to be insufficient to freeze motion while providing high contrast and spatial resolution images fo r general purposes. In clinical imaging there still is a need for MRI techniques with improved high spatial resolution, reduction o f artefacts secondary to bulk motion, and high contrast. These issues can be addressed by techniques like magnetization prepared fast GRE, (multi-shot) ERI techniques, and hybrid techniques such as GRASE (GRE and SE) . The (potential) solutions and problem s (saturation, blur, T2* decay and decreased contrast, chemical shift, etc.) of these techniques in liver imaging will be discussed. A nother reason fo r high speed imaging shared by abdom inal and m uscu loskeletal imaging is analysis o f dynam ic MRI to allow evaluation of tissue vascularization and perfusion. In this field spatial resolution and native contrast become less of an issue, therefore allowing focus on speed. Clinical applica tion, especially in oncologic imaging, in relation to data acquisition methods and post-processing will be discussed. A final clinical application of high speed imaging in the musculoskeletal system is MR-fluroscopy. Instead of morphology, function o f loaded joints is analyzed. S3 SS mass 24%, calcification 18% and circumscribed mass 4%; Frequency of missed cases present in dense breasts 76%. 82% of missed cases were subtle o r intermediate in degree. The m ost common mammographie feature in dense tissue was architectural distortion; a vague o r spiculated mass in fatty tissue.",

Purpose: Airway complications, such as bronchopneum onia are common after general anaesthesia and may be due to aspiration. This may be the consequence o f impaired striated musculature in the pharynx and larynx caused by residual neuromuscular paralysis postoperatively. The effect of curare on the swallowing apparatus is not well understood. Methods and Materials: Fourteen healthy humans (2 2 -4 4 y) were included after Human Ethical Committee approval. Simultaneous videoradiography and pharyngeal manometry was applied during rest, liquid swallowing of a water soluble contrast medium, and phonation. The mechanical adductor pollicis \"train-of-four\" (TOF) response w as recorded following supramaximal ulnar nerve stimulation at the wrist using a Myograph analyser. After i.v. infusion of vecuronium (0.1 mg/ml) TOF ratios of 0.60, 0.70, 0.80 and > 0.90 were obtained. Results: Pharyngeal constrictor muscle function was not affected at any level of paralysis. The resting tone o f the upper esophageal sphincter was significantly reduced at TOF ratios 0.60, 0.70 and 0.80 (p < 0.05). There was also a reduced muscle co-ordination and a shortened bolus transit time at TOF ratio 0.60. Eight volunteers had laryngeal penetration o f contrast media at a TOF ratio of 0.80 or less. Conclusion: We conclude that residual neurom uscular paralysis with TOF ratios of less than 0.90 are associated with functional impairment of the pharynx resulting in pharyngeal dysfunction and impaired protection of the airways with increased risk o f aspiration in the postoperative period. Coordination o f swallowing and respiration is of fundam ental importance for safe swallowing, i.e., that no part of liquid and solids reach the airways. In order to better understand this coordination, we examined 98 swallows in dysphagic patients by sim ultaneous video-radiography and respirogram. The presence of misdirected swallows were indicated and the duration's of the pharynx passage, the deglutition apnea, and the respiratory cycle were calculated. The study revealed that misdirected swallows had a somewhat prolonged pharynx passage, a som ewhat shorter deglutition apnea, and a shorter respiratory cycle. Despite the small differences the ratio between duration's of the deglutition apnea and the pharyngeal passage (the swallowing safety index) were significantly shorter in patients with misdirected swallows that in patients without (1.8 [1.0-4.2] versus 4.5 [2.4-6.7]; p < 0.001). Swallows with a low swallowing safety index had an increased risk of misdirected swallows even when the duration of the pharyngeal passage w as normal and S 6 it is concluded that low swallowing safety index is a risk factor fo r misdirected swallow. The study also revealed that the duration of the deglutition apnea did not adjust to the time o f the pharynx passage. Age shortened the deglutition apnea but did not influence the duration of the pharynx passage which may indicate that aspiration in elderly dysphagic subjects is more a consequence of a disturbed respiration than of pharyngeal dysfunction. Misdirected swallow did not influence the phase of the post swallow respiration (54% expiration) compared with correctly directed swallows. The swallowing safety index is of substantial value when evaluating dysphagia.",

Prior to intervention, contrast-enhanced spiral-CT w as performed to depict the true and the false lumen and to define the site o f fenestration. After diagnostic aortography of the true and the false lumen via bilateral fem oral accesses, a 30 cm long 10 F sheath w as inserted into the true com pressed lumen and an intravascular sonographic probe (IVUS) w as advanced into the false lumen from the contralateral side. Transseptal puncture was performed with a TIPS needle under IVUS guidance followed by dilatation of the puncture site using 8 to 18 mm balloon catheters. In one patient a 15 mm /10 cm Wallstent\u00ae was placed into the aorta and left common iliac artery to maintain perfusion of the extremity. Results: Fenestration relieved lower limb ischemia in all patients. Hypoper fusion of the left kidney could not be resolved due to progressive thrombosis of the renal artery. One patient died the day after the intervention due to myocardial infarction; autopsy revealed a patent aortoiliac stent and an open fenestration site. Conclusion: Percutaneous fenestration o f intimai flaps in aortic dissection using IVUS guidance is a cost-effective, less invasive alternative to surgery to treat lower limb ischemia.",

Aim o f this study was to assess the capability of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to identify and monitorate the postoperative com plications of aortic dissection. MRI was performed in 67 patients operated on fo r acute aortic dissection (61 type A and 6 type B). No residual dissection w as visualized in 16 patients (24%). A residual intimai flap was present in 51 patients (76%) with partial throm bosis of the false lumen in 25 cases (37%). Partial thrombosis of the false lumen was correlated to the diam eter of the false lumen (p = 0.0002) and to the presence of a periaortic hematoma (p = 0.0001). The pathological findings observed were aneurysmal dilation of the aorta (24 patients), chronic periprosthetic hematoma (10 patients), dilation of the coronary ostial reimplantation (3 patients), prosthetic infection (1 patient) and severe aortic regurgitation (2 patients). Twentysix of the 38 patients undergoing a scheduled follow-up showed a median increase in aortic diam eter > 5 < 10 mm/year. In conclusion, MRI is an optimal technique in the follow -up o f surgical treated aortic dissection providing an accurate dimensional evaluation of the aorta and identifying early com plications responsible fo r late death.

Materials and Methods: 5 patients with intracranial giant saccular aneurysms have been examined by parenchymatous (MRI) and angiographic (MRA) mag netic resonance imaging techniques. The MRA study systematically included 3D Time-of-Flight (TOF), 2D and 3D Phase Contrast (PC) sequences. 2D and 3D cine PC sequences were obtained with retrospective cardiac gating (16 samplings/cardiac cycle). In all PC sequences averaged modulus, magnitude of complex differences and directional phase differences images were reconstracted from the original data set. Besides conventional Maximum Intensity Reconstructions (MIP), cin\u00e9 loops were also created either from all three types of available source images. Results: Parenchymatous MR images and MIP reconstructions from both the 3D TOF or 3D PC MRA data sets provided useful information about the gross m orphology of intracranial giant saccular aneurysms. Source images from both TO F and PC sequences were useful in the analysis of the geom etry of the aneurysm neck. In addition to this, source images from PC sequences also provided information about inflow and outflow pathways. Directional phase difference images obtained in different orthogonal planes allowed analysis and decomposition of flow patterns inside the aneurysm al sac. These possibilities combined with the cin\u00e9-loop presentation, provided hem odynam ic information about intraaneurysm al flow patterns (video presentation) . Conclusion: The recently available 2D and 3D PC acquisition techniques and post-processing algorithm s with cin\u00e9 display possibilities provide a unique and unprecedented insight into the hem odynam ic aspects of giant intracra nial aneurysm s in a non-invasive and reproducible way. Inflow and outflow pathways, as well as intraaneurysmal flow patterns (regular-circular or irreg ular) are usually detectable. These preliminary observations suggest that the PC-MRA assessment may contribute to a better understanding of the natu ral evolution and prognosis of these relatively rare vascular pathologies and possibly lead to more adequate therapeutic measures. loxaglate lodixanol RBF",

            "text": "Magnetic resonance imaging has a significant role in investigation and m an agement of the cardiac patient. Spin echo sequences produce high resolution three dimensional images with high contrast between cardiac structures. Cine gradient imaging provides additional functional information, and velocity m ap ping allows velocity of blood flow and other moving structures to be measured reproducibly and accurately. Together these techniques provide im portant clinical information in patients with congenital heart disease (particularly in adults) and aortic disease, where magnetic resonance can be considered a prim ary imaging technique that can guide management and surgery without the need fo r invasive investigations. In patients with pericardial disease, myocardial disease, valvular disease and tumours, magnetic resonance imaging supplements the information available from other techniques such as echocardiography, and it can be considered a secondary imaging technique. In patients with ischaemic heart disease, the main role of magnetic resonance is in the assessm ent of ventricular function, including myocardial motion, thickness and thickening. These are important parameters of myocardial viability and the com bination o f cine MRI with myocardial perfusion scintigraphy is particularly valuable in the assessment of hibernating myocardium and the selection o f patients with ischaemic heart failure that will benefit from revascularisation. Rapid MR imaging techniques such as rapid gradient echo im aging and echo planar imaging have allowed noninvasive coronary angiography to be developed and early results are promising. W hilst reasonable sensitivity and specificity can be achieved in selected patients, the techniques are not yet sufficiently robust fo r routine clinical use, except perhaps in defining the course o f anomalous coronary arteries. Further developm ents which allow tracking of the diaphragm during normal respiration avoid the need for breath-holding and this improves the quality of MR coronary angiograms significantly. The same techniques have allowed myocardial perfusion to be assessed from tracking a bolus of contrast medium through the myocardium and agreem ent with scintigraphic techniques is good in selected patients. Whilst further developm ent is necessary, it is possible that MRI will allow com plete anatomical and functional assessment of patients with coronary artery disease. The real place of cardiac MRI will then be decided by practical issues such as availability of scanning time and professional expertise.",

            "text": "Com prehensive cardiovascular diagnosis requires both quantitative assess ment of cardiac anatom y and function. Patients suspected o f heart disease are usually studied by several non invasive and invasive imaging techniques, because no single modality usually provides all the necessary information for an optimal m anagem ent decision. Digital imaging has the potential to revolu tionize cardiac imaging by providing a complete evaluation with only one or tw o minimally invasive studies. Digital imaging offers the potential fo r rapid quantitation, segmentation and rendering including 3-D im aging, and multimodality image fusion. In the future Com puter Aided Diagnosis will also be used to analyze images obtained with high speed MRI, CT and Ultrasound in 2, 3 and even 4-Dimensions. Digital techniques have the potential to measure regional myocardial perfusion and ischemia. Since the power of the com puter chip doubles while its cost approxim ately halves every three years, the prospects for the future are exciting. However, the full impact of digital imaging will only be felt when the integration and connectivity of imaging devices is greatly improved. Once implemented, high speed image acquisition matched by rapid digital data quantitation and display will become routine fo r patient care. Finally, digital technology will be a key factor in the evaluation of treatm ent and for crucial patient outcom e studies. Results: 31 males and 47 females. Average age 52.5 \u00b1 13.7 years. 12/78 (15%) in surgical group; 6 had surgery, 2 awaiting surgery and 4 surgical re ferrals. Analysis with M ann-W hitney U tests. There w as a significant difference (p < 0.05) in three main areas between the surgical referred o r treated group and the group managed medically. The average age of the surgery group was 60.2 \u00b1 14.6 while that o f the medical group was 50.8 \u00b1 1 3 .1 years. The patients with clinical signs of nerve entrapm ent and those with spondylosis on the plain film were significantly more likely to undergo surgery. Purpose: To com pare com puted tom ography (CT) and myelography in estab lishing lumbar disc herniation and determ ine the prim ary examination method of imaging. Materials and Methods: W e have examined 154 patients. A total of 462 intervertebral discs were analysed. C T and myelography were used for all patients with symptoms of lumbar nerve roots lesion. The gantry angulation was adjusted so as to lie parallel to the plane of the disc. Every case was accompanied by establishing the degree o f bulging and the level o f compres sion. W e examined not more than three levels simultaneously. Myelography was performed using lumbar puncture by injection o f Omnipaque 180 or Omnipaque 240 (from 8 to 15 ml, depending upon the individual size of the dural sac and contrast medium used). During the procedure spinal fluid pressure was measured and the material fo r laboratory examination taken. Plain films were used to estimate nerve roots sheaths shape and contour. Results: Among 462 discs C T showed no pathological changes at 197 cases, disc bulging at 121, and herniation at 144 levels. Myelography has demonstrated 241, 106, and 135 discs appropriately. Based on findings at surgery and clinical signs, the true positive rate for myelography was 87.7 per cent, for CT 93.5 per cent. Conclusions: C T represents a noninvasive method with no puncture com plications and an ability to dem onstrate extremely lateral herniations that com bines with relatively low cost and radiation dose. The advantages of myel ography conclude visualisation of dural sac contents and better diagnostic information at operated patients. Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic perform ance of a new multi-slab 3D-FSE sequence, acquired with a high performance MR scanner in under 7 minutes, in comparison with conventional multi-scan procedures. Methods: 30 patients were included in the study. The conventional scan protocol included sagittal and axial 2D T2-w FSE acquisitions. In addition a 3D-FSE sequence (TR/TE 3500/109, ETL 8, 8 -1 0 slab, slice thickness 1 mm), was obtained in all patients. Reformatted images were obtained in the sagittal, coronal, axial and, if necessary, oblique plane with a slice thickness o f 2.6 mm. Prospective analysis o f the images was performed by tw o experienced radiologists separately fo r the 2D-image sets and the 3D-FSE images.",

M ethods and Materials: S eventy-four examinations on 61 patients with a definitive diagnosis of muscular dystrophy were retrospectively studied. The study includes myotonic dystrophy (29), Becker's (11), facioscapulohumeral (6), limb girdle (6), autosom al recessive childhood (4) and other smaller groups (5) of muscular dystrophies. Images were obtained on six different levels. Studied param eters were muscle size, attenuation, delineation and presentation o f m uscular fascia. Results were com pared with the results of 12 healthy persons. Results: There are significant differences between the groups o f muscular dystrophies by average rates of atrophy, hypertrophy and fatty infiltration. W e observed tw elve different types o f fatty infiltration in different stages of muscular dystrophies.

Diagnosis was confirmed at surgery: appendicitis: 6, diverticulitis: 5, adenocarcinoma: 4 Purpose: to assess the potential of Helical Hydro-CT (HHCT) for the preoper ative TNM-staging of colorectal carcinomas. Materials and Methods: 75 patients with suspected colorectal carcinomas were studied prospectively. For distension of the bowel wall a suspension of water and methylcellulose w as given rectally. Bolus tracking was used to optimize parenchymal and vessel contrast. Then spiral scanning of the abdomen/pelvis w as performed. TNM -stage o f colorectal carcinomas was assessed and com pared with histopathologic findings. Results: 94% of all colorectal carcinom as were correctly localized by HHCT. T-staging was correct in 77%, N-staging in 58% and abdominal M-staging in 83% of all cases. , Conclusions: Colorectal m\u00e0lignancies may reliably be diagnosed by HHCT. The accuracy of HHCT in determ ining especially the T-and M-factor of colorectal carcinomas is high. HHCT is a non-invasive imaging technique that is easy to perform and therefore may be of potential value in the preoperative management of patients with large bowel cancer. Methods and Materials: Three-dim ensionally reconstructed virtual CT colo noscopy was performed in 30 cases in patients with known colorectal tumors.

Results: In 26 of the 30 patients the CT endoscopy was highly similar to original endoscopic pictures, and barium enem a examinations. In two cases virtual colonoscopy could dem onstrate additional lesions not reached at colonoscopy. CT endoscopy gave endoscopic views from both oral and aboral directions, or surgical views also, with lateral opening o f the bowel. Additionally the transmural tum or extent and the locoregional lymph nodes could be visualized on partition images. Conclusion: Virtual C T colonoscopy, although can not replace endoscopy, might have applications: it can serve as a screening tool fo r colorectal cancer and may be used also fo r ruling out a higher lesion and staging the tum or in one session.",

Bellomi; Milan/I Introduction: Refractory malignant ascites is a frequent sequela of many neoplastic disease. Sym ptom s due to an accumulated critical volume of ascitic fluid may be the most debilitating aspects of the malignant process. Many palliative options have been employed with poor results. A simplified radiologically guided technique fo r insertion of a peritoneovenous shunt is described. M aterials and Methods: Two patients with refractory neoplastic ascites (one breast cancer and one pancreatic adenocarcinoma) were treated by a percu taneous insertion of a Denver peritoneovenous shunt between subclavian vein and peritoneous cavity. The procedures were entirely performed in the angio room with fluoro and ultrasound guidance. Time duration o f the procedure SS w as about 60 minutes. The patients were closely monitored fo r hemodynamic changes and then discharged one day later the procedure. Results: Procedures had no technical com plications or im portant hem ody namic changes (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation, heart failure etc.). In patient with breast cancer the shunt has been correctly working fo r six m onths (until patient death). The second catheter is regularly shunting after three months. Both catheters needed no management. Conclusions: In patients with poor prognosis refractory ascitis can be a diffi cult problem to manage. Radiological percutaneous insertion of a peritoneove nous shunt is to be considered a good alternative due to the microinvasivity and ease of procedure.",

Methods and Material: Interventional radiology leads to perform more and more com plex interventions requiring an adapted environm ent and strong rules to fight against nosocomial infections. M oreover indications fo r procedures requiring surgical access, and or com bined radio-surgical interventions are increasing. An interventional section has been designed to solve all these problems. The interventional suite is com posed of three angio-rooms. The access in controlled and sterile environm ent is preserved by permanent air handling.

To describe percutaneous CT-guided superior hypogastric plexus block using the anterior approach. Materials and Methods: In 7 patients with severe pain from pelvic m alig nancy, CT was employed to guide block of the superior hypogastric plexus with alcohol, using anterior approach of the needle. Patients were placed supine, and the needle advanced to the anterior surface of L5, just below the bifurcation o f large vessels. After injection of 1 ml of contrast to confirm correct positioning, a solution made of 10 (the first 4 cases) o r 15 ml of alcohol, 4 ml of marcaine and A d d itio n a l ml o f contrast medium was injected. The degree of pain relief was assessed using a four grade analog scale (none, mild, moderate, complete). Results: Needles were always successfully positioned, with bilateral spread of alcohol around iliac vessels. Pain relief was graded as com plete in 2 cases, moderate in 1, mild in 3, none in 1. Three patients had to reuse opiod analgesics after 8, 7 and 25 days. Best results were observed with the largest am ount of alcohol. No com plications were observed. Conclusions: C T guided percutaneous block of the superior hypogastric plexus with the anterior approach is safe and feasible in severe pain from pelvic malignancies. Further experience is needed to identify the best suited dose of alcohol to obtain long-lasting pain relief.

The endoprostheses were placed using fluoroscopic and endoscopic guidance under general anaesthesia. Preprocedural assessment and follow-up was done using clinical criteria including a dyspnoea score, and by chest radiographs. Results: W allstent placement was technically successful in all patients. One very ill patient died 2 hours following stent placement. All esophagorespiratory fistulae were com pletely closed by stenting. An improvem ent of tw o grades in the dyspneoa score occurred in 6 patients, a single grade in 4 patients. At a mean follow-up of 5.6 months, 8 patients were alive.

Material and Methods: Eight healthy volunteers and 34 patients with proved diffuse interstitial lung disease were studied on a 1.0 T system. Imaging included T2-weighted FSE, ECG-gated segmented T1-weighted breath hold FLASH sequences and T1-weighted SE sequences pre and post adminis tration of Gd-DTPA. 8 mm thick sections were obtained on the level o f the tracheal bifurcation and on levels 5 cm superior and inferior to the bifurcation. Quantitative image evaluation included S/N and \u0421/N measurements of lung tissue fo r 7 defined ROI's per lung on each level. The standard o f reference for disease activity was determ ined by a scoring system including results of bronchoalveolar lavage, ventilatory function tests, high resolution CT and follow -up chest radiographs. Results: C om pared to healthy volunteers in patients with interstitial lung disease significantly increased S/N and \u0421/N ratios were observed in FSE (p < 0.001) and SE (p < 0.05) sequences. Sensitivity of FSE sequences in detecting diffuse interstitial lung disease w as 91% and specificity 100%. The respective data fo r T1-w eighted SE sequences were 95% and 100% before and 70% and 100% after Gd-DTPA.

Subsequently, in 44 patients, we have used Spin-Echo T1-w. sequences on ax ial (8 -1 0 mm.) and coronal planes (5 mm) after Gd-DTPA i.v. administration. In all patients, MRI follow -up was performed between 2 and 9 months. Results: We obtained different patterns of signal intensity (SI) on T2-w. images and on T1-W. images after contrast medium administration. In particular, (8) patients, with high positivity on 67Ga scintigraphy, showed high SI on T2-w. images and a marked enhancement after Gd-DTPA. This condition was related to mediastinal rest activity. In (16) patients, with different 67Ga scintigraphy behaviour, we noticed a nonhom ogeneous SI on T2-w. images and irregular enhancement after Gd-DTPA, which better depicted the different components of the mass, as in presence of a partial active mediastinal rest. Clinical and MRI follow-up confirmed this condition. In the last 22 cases, with negative scintigraphy (\u00b1 ), the hypointensity on T2-w. images and the absence of enhancement after contrast medium were related to a fibrotic evolution of the mediastinal rest.",

Methods and Materials: 30 healthy volunteers underwent breathhold CE MRA in a high performance scanner (1.5 T, 25 mT/m). M easuring tim e varied between 3 0 -4 4 sec for a 3D TO F sequence (TR = 5 ms, TE = 2 ms, FA = 15', matrix size 166 x 256, partition thickness 2 -2 .2 5 mm, volum e thickness 5 0 -9 0 mm) with simultaneous injection of 0.2 mmol/kg BW Gd (power injector, MEDRAD). Bolus timing w as calculated individually according to a test injection o f 3 ml. All MRAs were reconstructed identically (MIP, targeted MIP, MPR). All segmental pulm onary vessels seen were counted with respect to the vascular generations by definition o f the bifurcations. Results and Conclusions: All distal pulm onary artery branches w ere clearly seen up to the 4 th -7 th vascular generation. Lack o f more peripheral visual ization than 4th generation was due to a limited box volume, m ostly ventrally (middle lobe, lingula). In 10 patients with varying thoracic vascular pathology which were investigated accordingly, all MRAs gave diagnostic documentation o f the pathology with exact display of localization and extent of the lesion (pulmonary embolism, vascular abnormalities, vascular compression).",

Zuna, G. van Kaick; Heidelberg/D Introduction: For spiral com puted tom ography (CT) advantages over con ventional CT are established for thoracic and abdominal imaging. The major advantage is the short acquisition time with the possibility o f volume-scanning of an entire region. Spiral CT is not widely used in the diagnostics of diseases of the lumbar spine. The aim o f our study w as to compare spiral CT with incremental CT to evaluate the best scan parameters in scanning the lumbar spine. Material and Methods: 7 dead bodys were examined. Tomographies were performed on a SOMATOM PLUS 4 CT-scanner (SIEMENS AG, Erlangen, Germany). Scanning param eters for incremental CT were 1.5 s rotation time, 3 mm slice thickness, 140 kV tube voltage, 292 mA tube current and a gantry-tilt parallel to the discs. Spiral CT's were performed with 140 kV tube voltage, 292 mA tube current, a pitch varying from 1.0 to 1.5 and slice thickness of 3 and 5 mm. Reviews of the spiral CT's were performed with a standard wide (360\u00b0) linear interpolation algorithm for the best com parison as well as com parable image noise. Evaluation was done in a blinded randomized way. Two experienced radiologists reviewed all CT's separately. Evaluation param eters were: delineation of the disc, the posterior edges of the vertebra bodys, the Lig. flavae, the dural sac, the facets and the nerve roots at the level L4/L3 and L5/S1. Also subjective scoring of the image noise was evaluated. All param eters were assigned to a sem iquantitative value between 1 and 4, 1 being a poor result and 4 being the best result. Statistical analysis was done with the F-test fo r partial sums o f squares.",

Thus, in trauma patients spiral CT with its shorter acquisition tim e can be used having sufficient image quality. Results: In just one case of sedation we could not manage to finish scanning so we were forced to give Ketamine. In all cases we have not any complication, and children w here observed only 30 minutes after scanning. In anaesthesia with Ketamin, we have 2 cases when IPPV was necessary, the period of active observation w as more than one hour, with specific demands (quiet surrounding, darkness etc.) Conclusions: Sedation with Midazolam has enormous advantage above any kind of anaesthesia because of simplicity, lake of complication, and time spending. Anyway, the Ketamin should remain as a useful drug for cases w hen sedation is not enough potent fo r completing an examination. To study the effects of ionic and non-ionic iodinated contrast agents in acute cerebral ischemia on infarction volume, neurological performance, and mortality in a rat model of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. Methods and Materials: W e induced focal cerebral ischemia in 64 rats us ing an endovascular occlusion technique o f the MCA. Four hours after MCA occlusion, 16 anim als received sodium iothalamate (588 mg iodine/kg), 16 anim als received iopromide as single bolus (518 mg iodine/kg) and 16 animals as double bolus (1036 mg iodine/kg). Sixteen anim als received equivolumetric (1.4 ml/kg) saline (control group). Neurological score and body weight were recorded every 8 hours. Twenty-four hours after vessel occlusion all ani mals were sacrificed and their brains stained with 2,3,5 triphenyl-tetrazoliumchloride to assess infarction size. Results: The normal and the double clinical dose of iopromide did not affect infarction volum e and neurological performance. Sodium iothalamate caused an increase in infarction volum e and w orsening of the neuroscore compared with the control group (p < 0.05). Mortality in the iothalamate group was 25%, compared to 12.5% in the control group and 6.25% in the iopromide groups, respectively. Conclusion: Our results suggest that bolus injection of the non-ionic iopromide in clinically relevant doses does not significantly affect infarction volume and clinical symptoms of cerebral ischemia. Non-ionic contrast agents should be preferred to ionic contrast agents during the acute stage of cerebral ischemia.",

To evaluate the pattern of enhancement using the superparamagnetic AMI-25 versus gadolinium in patients with liver cirrhosis due to W ilson's disease. Material and Methods: 11 patients with clinically and histopathologically proven W ilson's disease were investigated using unenhanced and AMI-25-S 38 enhanced MRI (Endorem\u00ae: 15 \u0434 \u0442\u043e 1/\u043a\u0434 body weight). 9 of these patients underwent MRI with gadolinium (Magnevist\u00ae: 0.1 mmol/kg body weight). Us ing histopathologic findings patients were devided in group 1 (non-acute stadium (n = 2): distinct liver cirrhosis and normal laboratory data) and group 2 (acute stadium (n = 9): active liver cirrhosis and changes of laboratory data). Results: In T2-weighted sequences, patients with non-acute stadium showed no changes of liver parenchyma unenhanced versus hypointense nodules using AMI-25-enhanced MRI. Patients with acute stadium demonstrated hy pointense nodules using unenhanced and AMI-25-enhanced MRI. Nodules showed a percentage signal intensity loss of 57.1% \u00b1 2.6 (non-acute stadium) versus 62% \u00b1 1 1 . 9 (acute stadium). C ontrast-to-noise ratio changed from -1 .4 \u00b1 1 . 5 unenhanced to -1 .1 \u00b1 0.6 enhanced (non-acute stadium), and from -1 .5 \u00b1 0.98 unenhanced to -1 \u00b1 1 enhanced (acute stadium). Unen hanced T1-weighted images revealed no changes (non acute stadium) versus slight changes of liver parenchyma (acute stadium). Gadolinium-enhanced T 1 -weighted scans increased detection rate for both groups. Conclusion: AMI-25-enhanced MRI is valuable in the staging of patients with W ilson's disease revealing a specific morphologic pattern.",

Molloy; Dublin/IRL Purpose: Iodine has been extensively used as contrast enhancing agent in radiographic angiographic procedures. In some patients, Iodine hypersensi tivity o r renal impairment makes the use of Iodine based agents hazardous. Gadolinium has been used as a contrast agent in MRI with proven patient tolerability. In this project the use o f Gadolinium as a possible contrast agent in angiographic procedures was examined. A three pronged approach to this investigation was used. Methods and Materials: Firstly the use of Gadolinium and Iodine was com putationally modelled. The minimum detectable quantity of both Iodine and Gadolinium was determ ined for various kVp's, inherent filtration and tissue thickness. In the second phase, tw o objects containing equal weights o f Iodine and Gadolinium were imaged on a Philips DVI system. The contrast was de term ined digitally as a function of kVp and inherent filtration. The results were compared to those obtained from the model. In the final phase, patients with known sensitivity to Iodine based agents, and requiring vascular angiography were imaged using gadolinium (Magnevist) .",

Methods and Methods: 10 healthy volunteers were investigated using a Siemens Vision MRI unit (1.5 Tesla, 25 mT/m). Single breath-hold technique was applied with sim ultaneous injection of a 30 ml i.v. bolus. 3 different dosages (0.05, 0.1, 0.2 mmol Gd/kg BW corresponding to half, single and double dose) where injected on three consecutive days. A 3D TOF sequence (TR = 5 ms, TE = 2.1 ms, FA = 30\u00b0, matrix size 224 x 256, partition thickness = 1.5 mm, vol. thickness = 60 mm, measuring time = 44 sec) was invariably used. Bolus timing w as adjusted individually to center of k-space according to a preceding 3 ml test bolus injection. MRAs were evaluated by MIP and ROI measurements in the renal segm ent o f the abdominal aorta, proximal renal arteries and background signal. Qualitative and quantitative visualization of renal arteries was assessed by tw o experienced radiologists, blinded concerning dosages and personal data. Results: Single and double dose technique show no significant difference concerning the visualization and contrast evaluation of healthy renal arteries. The lowest contrast media concentration used was clearly inferior in regard of imaging qualities. Conclusion: We propose that the widely used triple dose CE MRA of renal arteries could be replaced by single dose technique, because our results strongly suggest that single dose (0.1 mmol Gd/kg KG) has equal diagnosticai benefit.",

Peters; M \u00fcnster/D Purpose: To evaluate w hether power injection of contrast media guarantees a constant flow-rate fo r dynamic MRI. Methods and Materials: A pressure controlled commercially available power injector (Ulrich AG, Ulm, FRG) with a flow-rate of 5 ml/s was used. Commer cially available gadolinium chelates (gadopentetate dimeglumine (Magnevist\u00ae, Schering AG, Berlin, FRG), gadodiamide (Omniscan\u00ae, Nycomed AG, Munich, FRG)) were tested fo r flow-rates with intravenous access lines (Insyte-W\u00ae, Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, FRG) with diam eters of 1 6 ,1 8 , 20, 22, 24, and 26 gauche. Every measurement was repeated 10 times for each diameter and each contrast media. All contrast media were tested at room and body temperature. Results: Both, tem perature and diam eter of i.v. access lines have an important influence on real flow-rates. Only i.v. access lines < 20 gauche should be used in combination with pressure controlled power injectors. Conclusion: Dynamic MR-lm aging with power injection of contrast media requires intravenous access lines < 20 gauche to maintain a constant high flow-rate. The assessment o f pulm onary ventilation is of substantial need in the diagnosis, monitoring and follow-up o f numerous pulm onary diseases. Considering the developm ent o f an appropriate MR-technique, one eminent precondition has to be fulfilled: contrast agent droplets have to be small enough to obtain sufficient contrast agent distribution within the lungs and to obtain homogenous enhancement o f the lungs. Thus we are describing the development and first use of a new Gd-DTPA-aerosol optimized fo r MRventilation-imaging of the lungs. Materials and Methods: The distribution of a contrast agent within the lungs is determined by the droplet diameter, which itself is determined by the surface tension. A new Gd-DTPA-based aerosol with Mannitol and Lutrol\u00ae (Schering AG, Berlin), has a reduced droplet diam eter size and surface tension compared to Magnevist\u00ae. Two experimental groups are examined: (I) 3 subgroups of male Wistar han. rats (n = 5/group) are undergoing mask-ventilation for 5, 10 and 15 min. with (1) Gd-DTPA-aerosol, (2) Magnevist\u00ae and (3) 0.9% NaCI, using a new ultrasonic nebulizer capable to produce particles with a size of < 2 \u03bc\u03c0\\ (total 97% < 3 \u0434\u0433\u043f) to reach homogenous alveolar lung deposition. Imaging (precontrast; 5 min., 30 min., 60 min. and 14 h post-contrast) is performed using a 2.0 T system with a SE-Sequence (TR = 150 ms, \u0422\u0415 = 3 ms, Slice = 3 ms, NEX = 16). (II) 3 subgroups of W istar han. rats (n = 5/group) are examined with a model of artificial segmental brochial obstruction using again (1) Gd-DTPA-aerosol (2) Magnevist\u00ae and (3) 0.9% NaCI. Results: 1) MR-images o f healthy rats dem onstrate homogenous lung en hancement showing homogenous contrast agent uptake. 2) MR-lmages of rats with artificial segmental brochial obstruction show segmental lack o f en hancement.

Albrecht, P. Dawson; London/U K Purpose: Scattered reports have appeared in the literature on using Gdchelates as X-ray contrast agents. This study was undertaken form ally to investigate the contrast effects of Gd in patients undergoing digital subtraction angiography (DSA), intravenous urography (IVU) and CT. M aterials and Methods: 15 patients attending fo r coeliac axis DSA (n = 5), abdominal CT (n = 5) and IVU (n = 5) were injected with 0.3 mmol/kg GdDTPA (maximum approved dose). For DSA and IVU, images were categorized as diagnostic o r non-diagnostic. For CT enhancem ent w as measured in H ounsfield Units (HU). Results: DSA: All 5 patients had diagnostic arteriogram s and 4/5 indirect portograms were diagnostic. IVU: 4/5 studies yielded diagnostic pyelograms. All nephrograms were relatively poor. CT: Average peak aortic enhancement was 75 HU but duration w as short. In all 15 cases enhancem ent was weaker than that achieved with routine dosage of iodinated agents. Conclusion: GdDTPA yielded diagnostic arteriogram s in all cases and diag nostic indirect portograms and IVU's in most cases. Its efficacy in CT proved limited but higher doses than currently approved would be potentially useful. Gd-chelates may be clinically useful in X-ray studies on patients at high risk of anaphylactoid reactions to iodinated agents. The quantification of structural elem ents of bone tissue is important fo r the evaluation of metabolic bone diseases, in particular for the assessment o f fracture risk. We propose the application of com plexity measures fo r the quantitative analysis of trabecular structures in vertebral bodies. Methods and Materials: Axial slices of 1 mm thickness of lumbar vertebrae from human cadavers were obtained on a CT-Scanner. These slices were evaluated with algorithm s based on measurement m ethods derived from non linear dynamics, e.g. Shannon-Entropy, Renyi-Entropy. The BMD of the same vertebrae w as measured by OCT. The vertebrae measured by QCT were divided in tw o groups: normal BMD specimens, osteoporotic specimens. Results: The osteoporotic specimens were clearly distinguishable from the normal specimens by com plexity measures. The difference o f structural ele ment distribution o f osteoporotic vertebrae is maintained through the entire vertebrae although there are slight differences from slice to slice. Conclusion: C om plexity measures are a valuable tool to quantify trabecular structures in vertebrae.",

Kalender; Erlangen/D Purpose: To develop reproducible spongiosa models fo r the characterization of the potential of high resolution CT and MR applied to the structural analysis of trabecular bone. Methods and Materials: Arbitrary structures can be transformed into 3D plastic models using the new technology of stereolithography. The input data can either be generated on a com puter or can be derived e.g. from a 3D C T datasets. The models are build slice by slice. W e used artificial regular grid structures to characterize hom ogeneity and spatial resolution of the stereolithographic process and a \u03bc\u039f\u03a7 dataset fo r the spongiosa model. Results: Stereolithographic models of artificial geometries showed that a spatial resolution o f 100 \u0434 \u0442 and variations of \u00b1 20 \u0434 \u0442 are technically achievable. Plastic models of the 3D digital bone model were manufactured successively using various magnification factors. The bone models were based on \u0430 \u0434 \u0421 \u0422 data set o f a trabecular bovine bone sam ple (1 cm3, 176 consecutive slices, thickness 56 \u0434 \u0442 ; in plane pixel size 56 \u0434 \u0442 ) . Conclusion: For the first time a realistic standard of trabecular bone is available which can be used to verify structural parameters as determined by high resolution Q C T and MR. The model can be used for a comparison of 2D and 3D structural analysis methods and for an analysis o f decreasing spatial resolution. Structural characteristics can easily be changed by. e.g. thinning or removing trabeculae in the digital model. Thus a whole set of realistic structural conditions in healthy and osteoporotic patients can be easily simulated.",

Methods and Materials: An artificial phantom with a CT density similar to child's skull and defined linear and round lesions was examined with spiral C T (Somatom Plus 4, Siemens AG, Germany) with varying scan parameters. Surface shaded display (SSD), maximum intensity projections (MIP) and multiplanar reconstructions were evaluated with regard to lesion conspicuity and reconstruction artifacts. Results: Multiplanar reconstructions were superior to MIP reconstructions in lesion conspicuity and diagnostic confidence. In SSD reconstructions lesions w ere obscured depending on scan parameters and lesion size, shape, and orientation. Conclusion: The proper technique fo r 3D -C T of bone lesions is influenced by a variety of scan and reconstruction param eters and depends on the nature and size of the lesions. Even the optimal scan technique does not allow correct depiction of small lesions and has therefore to be used carefully. Conclusion: There was no statistically significant difference between screenfilm system and aSi-detector images in respect to detectability of fractures and cortical bone lesions.

ANOVA was used to establish the level of statistical significance of the observed differences between sequences. Results: TSE STIR T2 w as more sensible than TSE T2 (85% vs 55%) and than SE T2-DP (85% vs 60%). After injection of SPIO all sequences collectively detected much more lesions than without c.m. and TSE STIR showed the best sensibility (98%); TSE T2 (BH) increased a lot the sensibility (70% ) in spite of turbo factor.

Iron-oxide enhanced MRI was performed on a 0.2 T and at 1.5 T system. Both examina tions w ere perform ed in one session. T2 weighted sequences were analysed. Evaluation included lesion counts, determ ination of lesion conspicuity and overall image quality (both graded on a scale 1-5). Quantitative analysis was performed on 29 lesions. Lesion to liver signal intensity and contrast to noise ratios were calculated. Results: 59 lesions were detected on high field, 63 on low field. On both system s median value for lesion conspicuity was 3. No statistically significant difference w as found. Global image quality w as rated higher on the high field system: 3 vs 2 fo r the low-field system (p = 0.0017). Quantitative analysis showed no difference fo r lesion to liver signal intensity ratios or contrast to noise ratios. Conclusion: Better image quality on the high field system does not result in a better lesion detection, o r a better lesion conspicuity. Low field systems appear to have equal diagnostic value in lesion detection as compared to high field system s in iron oxide enhanced MRI of focal liver lesions. In the 166 patients with < 8 FLLs, a significantly higher number o f lesions was detected following Gd-BOPTA administration (p < 0.009 -0.001). Confidence in detecting/excluding lesions w as significantly improved by Gd-BOPTA injection (p < 0.001). Lesion characterisation was better for delayed post-contrast than pre-contrast images, with increased confidence in distinguishing solid from non-solid lesions. Bolus dynamic imaging pro vided additional confidence in lesion characterisation in 17 -25% of patients, compared to plain and delayed post-contrast MRI. Dynam ic and/or delayed Gd-BOPTA enhancement was considered radiologically useful in 82% of pa tients. The additional information provided by Gd-BOPTA could help to change diagnostic conclusions in 47% of patients, and was reported to influence the management of 23% of patients. Conclusions: Gd-BOPTA-enhancement was useful both during dynamic scanning and in delayed imaging of FLLs.",

Galanski; Hannover/D Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of breath-hold 3D MR an giography o f the renal arteries with high-dose gadolinium in comparison to conventional arterial DSA. Methods and Materials: Thirty patients scheduled fo r arterial DSA (renovas cular hypertension = 15, kidney donors = 8, after renal transplantation = 3, renal tum ors = 4) were examined additionally with a fast 3D SPGR sequence (flip angle 60\u00b0; TR/TE 13/2.5 ms) using 30 ml gadolinium (flow 2 ml/s) and 20 ml saline (flow 1.5 ml/s). A set of 28 coronal slices (slice thickness 2 mm) was acquired in 42 seconds breath-hold with a torso phased-array surface coil (1.5 T; GE Signa). Image analysis included interactive cine mode, 2D multiplanar reform ations (MPRs), 3D surface shaded displays (SSDs) and maximum intensity projections (MIPs). Results: Three-dimensional MR angiography with gadolinium identified 9/12 accessory arteries and classified correctly 50/54 normal renal arteries, 5/6 non-significant (< 50%) and 8/9 significant (> 50%) renal artery stenoses. SSDs and MIPs tend to overestimate vascular stenoses. Interactive analysis (cine mode) and 2D MPRs were essential for correct classification. Vascular enhancement w as insufficient in 3 patients. Patients and Methods: Outcome data of 25 patients with transplant renal artery stenosis referred to angioplasty during a 9-year period were reviewed and analyzed. The indication fo r angioplasty was either an increase in the serum creatinine or a rise in blood pressure. In 80% of the patients the an gioplasty was carried out using the crossover technique from the contralateral femoral approach. In the rest, either an ipsilateral fem oral o r transaxillary approach was used. 2 renal arteries were stented. Results: In 60% of the patients the stenosis were immediately distal to the anastom otic side. One patient had fibrom uscular dysplasia of the transplanted artery. The other patients had narrowings more distally including the branch vessels. The initial diagnosis was established either by colour code duplex sonography o r spiral CT. In 72% o f the cases the angioplasty or stentimplantation w as successful o r partially successful. In 2 patients angioplasty was not attempted on account of high-grade kinking of the transplant renal artery. In one patient who received an additional Y-graft the transplant renal artery was reanastomosed onto the graft and was hence not angioplastied. In the rest of the patients the angioplasty was not successful either because of an elastic stenosis or inability to catheterize the artery. The patients where angioplasty was unsuccessful o r not carried out were subjected to resurgery. 74% of the patients, w ho received PTA showed a significant fall of serum creatinine. Only 58% o f the patients responded with improvement of the blood pressure. One patient developed an arterial dissection and required stenting of the renal artery. In a further patient branch artery occlusion was noted. Conclusion: PTA including stent implantation is technically successful and is associated with a good clinical outcom e in the majority of cases. PTA should be viewed as the primary treatm ent modality in transplant renal artery stenosis, before proceeding to resurgery.",

Increased availability, decreased cost and improved quality of MRI have made this modality the primary choice in evaluation of degenerative disease at many centers. Tumors: Primary extra-axial tum ors in the spine are rare. Intradurally, meningeoma and neurinoma are the dominating lesions. In the epidural space, metastasis constitutes the vast majority o f tumors. The diagnosis of spinal tum ors has been greatly facilitated by MRI, which is the modality of choice for evaluation. However, fo r screening of non-sym ptom atic metastatic disease, isotope studies are still most cost-effective, although there are some tumors, such as myeloma and lymphoma, which som etim es give a false negative examination. Infection: Spinal epidural infections are relatively rare but important, since correct and early diagnosis usually leads to perm anent cure, w hereas an overlooked diagnosis might lead to permanent neurological deficits. MRI is the modality of choice and the epidural abscess com bined with discitis is easily shown in the typical case.

The applications of surface coils in different anatomic regions and their influence upon signal to noise ration and spatial resolution will be explained. The advantages and shortcomings o f conventional imaging techniques will be discussed and also the current applications of newer sequence developm ents like fo r cinem atic joint imaging. The possibilities of contrast preparation techniques like fat saturation and magnetization transfer contrast and their com bination with different pulse sequences will be explained. Furthermore, the intravenous and intraarticular application of paramagnetic contrast agents and their use fo r joint imaging will be reviewed. Finally, diagnostic guidelines for the most important joint examinations like the knee, the shoulder, and the hip will be presented. The increasing developm ent of new technologies in last years has allowed the availability of numerous and sophisticated equipment fo r breast imaging, whose utilization requires skill and expertise of true professionals of breast diagnosis with a multimodality integrated approach. Diagnostic performance of single techniques has been therefore improved. In the clinical practice, early detection o f subtle and minimal lesions becomes more and more frequent and early diagnosis of breast cancer is possible nowadays much more than before. Furthermore, new Bio-imaging technologies are getting increasing attention and w ider evaluation. On the other hand, many topics are still to focus: multicentric cancer, in situ cancer, atypical proliferative lesions and clinical recommendations fo r screening of women aged 4 0 -4 9 years. High quality technology, specific knowledge and experience in breast pathol ogy and standardization o f operating levels, must be considered as essential requirem ents to achieve the best results in early detection of malignant breast lesions. In the clinical setting, the exact size of a m alignant tumor, multifocality and an extensive intraductal com ponent are im portant factors in the pre-selection of patients fo r breast conserving therapy (BCT). Careful selection based on the evaluation of high quality mammography, magnification vieuws, ultra sonography and magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) keeps the occurrence of recidiv tum or growth after breast conserving therapy within an acceptable range. In the age group below 50 however, mammography is much less sensitive in the detection of breast cancer. Imaging techniques like ultra sonography and MRI and maybe in future full size digital mammography with com puter aided diagnosis can play an im portant role both in the detection and in the evaluation of malignant breast lesions in this age group. Because of the rather low specificity, their role in breast cancer population screening is limited. From the different imaging techniques the possibilities fo r detection and evaluation are discussed. ",

On the basis of the anatom ic structure of their origin, we distinguish ductal-and lobular-type MC. Practically in all cases, the ductal-type linear or branching MC is associated with a malignant process, usually the comedo-type, poorly differentiated ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), the mammographie interpretation of which is straightforward. The lobular-type fine granular MC may be associated with both malignant o r benign processes. The malignant process is usually the non-com edo, well-differentiated (cribriform/micropapillary/clinging) DCIS. The benign process is usually some type of fibrocystic \"disease\", often with atypical ductal hyperplasia. The mammographie interpretation of the lobular type MC is rather difficult. Cer tain guidelines may help in the distinction between a benign and a malignant process. Multiple clusters (3 o r more) are usually associated with DCIS. C omedo and non-com edo intraductal carcinomas differ in anatom ic distribu tion, mammographie detectability and biological behaviour.

Invasive cancers can be divided in tw o groups based on their biological be haviour: special types (about 30% ) and non-special, o r common types (70%). Special types, such as lobular invasive, tubular, mucinous and medullary car cinom as have a relatively good prognosis com pared to the common types.

They have poorer prognosis, that is, a higher metastatic potential than special type invasive carcinomas. They lack special mammo graphie and histologic features and show up usually as poorly outlined densi ties on the mammogram. Because of their high metastatic potential, the early detection o f invasive ductal cancers (detection in their pre metastatic state) has a greater impact on mortality than the special type invasive carcinomas. The clinical examination, the plain film s o f the abdomen, and sometimes contrast studies are used since a long time and remain the basic explorations for the management. In elective conditions depending of both the clinical status and the medical experience, Sonography (US) may be used.

Thoracic and abdominal aorta, iliac, fem oral and popliteal arteries are the most frequent locations in w hich a covered stent can be used. In peripheral arteries and thoracic aorta a tube-graft of various size can be effective to exclude the aneurysm from the streaming flow, although a previous side branch embolization is som etimes necessary to avoid aneurysmal feeding. In most abdominal aortic aneurysm s a bifurcated prosthesis is mandatory since many aneurysm s extend to the bifurcation or the upper portion of common iliac arteries. Many technical problem s exist in stent-grafting of abdom inal aorta aneurysms: the correct sizing of aneurysmal neck and iliac arteries, the proper w ay of hooking the stent-graft to the artery, the delivery of the device from the femoral approach, the precise and stable positioning, the percutaneous achievement of the intraluminal bifurcation.

The interest fo r the radiological approach has been renewed and many authors have described im portant modifications of Pulmonary Tuberculosis pattern in the adult. It is important to analyse the normal and innusual patterns of the disease. According to this, AA review the radiological aspects of PT also mentioning its association with AIDS or Cancer. Special reference is made to the new radiological aspects described in cases evaluated by CT or HRCT. Special attention has been focused on the images o f drug-resistant tuber culosis. It is emphasized the utilization o f interventional techniques in the diagnosis. Sunday the clinical suspicion, evaluate the extent of the disease and its progression in the follow -up series, and discover the complications. The chest radiograph maintains a key role in the ICU. Its simplicity, repeata bility, low cost and high performance at the different thoracic levels make it a superb w indow open on the different problematics o f the chest. The importance of a rigorous technique and of a precise knowledge of the anatomy should be stressed, particularly in order to discover the iatrogenic complications. CT and US may also be helpful occasionally. The purpose of this session is to review the basic principles of diagnostic testing and their role in clinical decision making. We first will define and explain the concept of diagnostic accuracy, and its importance in the technology assessm ent process. Next, we will illustrate the calculation of sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value using real-world clinical examples represented by fam iliar two-by-tw o tables. The clinical utility of each concept will be discussed and com pared. Then, we will offer m ethods to understand and avoid biases that com m only affect the assessment of diagnostic tests, including spectrum bias and verification bias. Lastly, we will demonstrate the use of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, describe its strengths and weaknesses, and outline its relationship to sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy. The goal of the session will be to integrate concepts of diagnostic accuracy into the everyday process of clinical decision making. Attendees will also gain an understanding of the fundam ental principles that underlie outcom es research and cost-effectiveness analysis in radiology. At the end of the session, attendees should be able to critically evaluate the accuracy of imaging tests and apply their understanding to radiologic practice. Digital imaging modalities have become an accepted tool to carry out radi ological work in a fam iliar way. Advanced information processing and com munication tools, however, provide new ways fo r radiology to evolve. Various levels of com puter hardware and software are the basic informatics enabling technologies for diagnostic tool development. The tutorial will briefly introduce the structure of informatics as a science and engineering discipline. It will then focus on those aspects of the application level which have the potentially greatest impact on radiology. Computer graphics and com puter vision, in particular, but also neural networks, fuzzy sets, and generic algorithm s will be discussed. These new tools can augment diagnostic activities and are therefore part o f a promising com puter assisted radiology.",

Eighty percent of all computer errors are introduced at the planning stage, before any coding takes place. To reduce such errors and improve effectiveness, it is necessary to define the domain, specify user requirements, w ork out the data structures 'methods' and data flows, design the architecture, and (try to) make the implementation fu tu re p ro o f. Formal m ethods exist, fo r example functional, data, and oper ation models. However, com prom ises are required, e.g. in matching existing standards such as DICOM .vithin the context of healthcare-wide networks, and the requirements fo r image quality and speed within the limitation of cost effective implementation. This is know conventional software engineering, but the specific implications fo r radiology will be presented. In addition, it is impor tant to present the chain o f processes though which a digital image passes being: acquisition, manipulation, display, analysis, and evaluation. The impact of digital methods in image form ation has extending throughout radiology, from CT, through MR to ultrasound and use of photostim ulable plates. Handling and manipulating such data, from simple processes such as windowing, to complex operations such as factor analysis leads to the need to present the information (not data) in the most effective manner, to provide tools (often from computer vision) to enhance detection, quantitation, and interpretation, leading finally to the need for good evaluation m ethods, such as (but not only) ROC analysis.

Technical aspects of renal angioplasty utilizing both simple coaxial techniques, and those employing guiding catheters and more com plex coaxial techniques will be demonstrated based on video tapes from liv e \" patient demonstrations.

Maroldi; Brescia/I An adequate control of laryngeal carcinoma can be achieved by surgery (con servative and radical), by radiotherapy or by a com bination of both. Supraglottic neoplasms surgically treated show low incidence of recurrence at the primary site (2-4% ), more frequently at the base of the tongue, while the recurrence rate after radiotherapy for glottic carcinoma is much higher (5 -40% ). The clinical diagnosis of a recurrent tum our can be difficult, especially in patients with a persistent postradiation edema. Therefore, knowledge of the normal CT appearance of the larynx after conservative and radical surgery plays a significant role in the differentiation between recurrent carcinom a and changes due to therapy. This normal postoperative pattern includes typical changes of the laryngeal framework, thickening of the mucosa covering arytenoid carti lages, developm ent of \"pseudocords\" and \"pharyngeal pouches\" with air or liquid content. Interestingly, CT seems very useful in detecting nonneoplastic causes of submucosal expansive lesions (eg chondroradionecrosis, laryngocele). The most frequent CT findings of recurrent lesions after surgery consist of a mass larger than 10 mm spreading beyond the larynx, thickening o f the anterior commissure, erosion of residual cartilages. Furthermore, CT provides an accurate map of the submucosal extent of recurrent tum ours either at the prim ary site o r at the tracheal stoma. Different causes of vocal cord mobility impairment can also be demonstrated by C T or MR. Over the last tw o decades radiological diagnostic procedures requested for and performed on children have increased both in num ber and complexity. Quality images are essential to justify the procedure trauma, caused by either immobilisation techniques or the radiation burden.

MRI appears to have a similar overall accuracy to CT, w hereas ultrasound is less accurate than CT or MRI in the overall staging of tumours. However, ultrasound is extremely accurate in identifying and localising the clinically im portant tum our extension into the intrahepatic vena cava and right atrium and if local surgical practice requires only a knowledge o f venous invasion, a technically adequate ultrasound examination may suffice.

Pistitsch; Munich/D Purpose: Recently, Digital Radiography (DR) has become more widespread in Radiology. This is based on (1 ) image quality assurance (2) dose reduction (3) cost effectiveness (4) integration of conventional radiology in PACS's. It's the aim of this lecture to present a survey o f specific diagnostic applications of DR. Materials and Methods: Two different digital modalities are frequently used: Digital Luminescence Radiography (DLR) and Digital Fluoroscopy (DF). Pulsed Digital Fluoroscopy is a modern technique with param ount interest for dose reduction. For practical application, DLR proved useful fo r radiogra phy of the musculoskeletal system and chest. DF came out from angiography and is utilized for investigations in gastroenterology and recently fo r traum a tological emergency cases. To clarify the present status a large num ber of ROC-studies have been taken. Results: Pulsed DF ensures a reduction o f up to 80% of radiation dosage. DF presents the image data while the investigation is on and offers the opportunity to take image data as fram e grapping. DF offers a reliable image quality. For the delineation o f erosive gastritis digital fluoroscopy is no adequate. DR generally avoids repetetive X-ray examinations and thus contributes to moderate dose reduction. ROC-studies confirmed image quality of DLR as equal to the conventional film-screen system (speed class 200/400) in (nearly) all applications. Monitor assisted reporting is very helpful. Conclusions: DR has m ajor advantages for musculoskeletal and chest ex aminations, angiography as well as gastroenterology.

W hile the clinical benefit in presence of well defined results can be easily measured in case of a new modality, a new procedure or a new product, this is more difficult when the relationship is not only strictly direct and quantifiable, such as in the case of the use of digital vs. conventional radiology. In this case in fact, while some items are tangible and their costs valuable (equipments, service, films), other items are less tangible and quantifiable (staff, training, hospital infrastructure, productivity, diagnostic accuracy, etc.), especially if w e consider that the potential benefits of DR concern sim ultaneously the radiologist, the referring physician, the patient and the hospital. For the economic assessment we have considered the data published in the literature with those obtained in four different radiologic departm ents from hospitals having different characteristics (Leuven, Monza, Rome, Treviso), where partial o r full DR system s of different industries are active. If we consider the tangible items (equipments, service, films) there is a difference between DR and film-screen radiology, the first one costing more than the second from 6 to 18% per year. This extra cost, which should be progressively reduced, is largely com pensated by the reduction o f exposure errors (from 3.3 to 6.0% ) and of radiation exposure of the patient (50%), better file and administration management, improved productivity, possibility to use CAD systems, better patient management, better training of student and residents, etc. C ore-needle biopsies are being considered as good alternatives to traditional surgical biopsies. Not the less they are more invasive than fine-needle aspi ration citology. Their cost is higher and they may produce tissue changes that alter the imaging appearance. All three guidance systems can be used: palpation, ultrasound and stereotactic imaging. For nonpalpable lesions ultrasound guidance is safer and quicker; in all cases the needle must be fired in a way that is parallel as possible to the thoracic wall. Direct visualization of the needle allows correct positioning and monitoring of the whole procedure. Core biopsies are done with spring activated guns using needles ranging from 14 to 18 gauge. After injection o f lidocaine a small nick is made so that the needle can be easily passed. One to five passes into different areas of the lesion are required. A new biopsy device, the mammotome, uses vacuum and a tissue transport mechanism so that multiple sam ples can be obtained with one insertion. Microhistology is 94% and over accurate, and adequate tissue is provided for many prognostic markers.",

Indicational criteria fo r the carotid endarterectomy are well established. The related com plication and recurrency rate o f this procedure at optimally trained centers is well known and accepted as a standard. Seem ingly carotid angio plasty meets this standard but ongoing studies have to give evidence. Stents have become a valuable tool predom inantly to fight intimai flaps and treat severily calcified plaques. However the tool is not optimally adopted to carotid use yet. According to the technical evolution o f endovascular treatments the man agem ent o f intracranial haemorrhage is more and more a multidisciplinary approach in which the interventional neuroradiologist has an im portant place. Facing a patient with intracranial haemorrhage, first we must collect a ll the inform ations useful fo r diagnosis: Circumstances o f initial bleeding, evolution, clinical symptoms. A grading must be established according to the \"Glas gow Coma Scale\". The CT scan must be realized in emergency most often without contrast injection, to see a subarachnoidal bleeding, an intracranial hematoma and/or an intraventricular haemorrhage. It is very im portant to es tim ate the ventricular dilatation which can require an external shunting. The angiographic study of both internal carotid artery and both vertebral arteries is realized by transfem oral approach. The classic A.P., lateral and oblique pro jections can be replaced by spin angiography able to show the malformation which has bleed and to study its angioarchitecture (neck of aneurysm-nidus, feeding pedicules and draining veins of an AVM...). The angiographic study o f cerebral circulation m ust be exhaustive; haemodynam ic parameters are im portant. We m ust appreciate the frequent vasospasm and multiple aneurysms are not rare. A transcranial Doppler is mandatory to follow -up the cerebral blood flow. Indeed, blood inside subarachnoidal space can induce vasospasm and hydrocephalia. The risk of vasospasm is high: a preventive treatment with calcium channel blockers is immediately started. A precise follow-up with transcranial Doppler allow s to detect the vasospasm as soon as possible; if a neurological deficit appears, an hyperselective intracranial angioplasty can be necessary in emergency. According to clinical evolution, CT scan can be repeated to know if brain oedem a o r ventricular dilatation is developing. When there is a ventricular dilatation, a ventricular shunt is mandatory. After these initial examinations, we m ust decide w hat is the best treatment and when this treatm ent must be done. To day, all the team s agree to do the treatm ent as soon as possible, very often in emergency. W hen endovascular approach is indicated, the best solution is to do immediately the endosaccular treatm ent after the end o f the angiography. The best indications fo r endovascular approach are often poor indication for open skull surgery and vice versa: vertebrobasilar aneurysm and anterior com municating aneurysm are good examples. The aneurysm of the first bifurcation of the middle cerebral artery remains difficult for endosaccular packing. Indication fo r treating in em ergency a ruptured brain AVM o r a dural fistula, are rare. A very close cooperation between neuro-anaesthesiologists, neurosurgeons and interventional neuroradiologists is necessary to choose the best treatm ent that is to say the less risky, the m ost comfortable and the less expansive. Clinical examination of the paediatric scrotum can be difficult, as the child may be em barrassed, frightened or in pain. Accurate differentiation must be made between the surgical emergency o f acute torsion of the testis from medical condition such as epididymo-orchitis. Although Grey Scale ultrasound o f the scrotum provided useful information, it was only with the advent of Colour Doppler ultrasound that a precise and accurate diagnosis of testicular torsion could be made. Power Doppler ultrasound technology can now be used to give further information about blood flow, particularly in the younger child where the testis is small and in whom it is often more difficult to detect flow in the normal testis using C olour Doppler. The use of Colour Doppler ultrasound and other relevant imaging modalities will be discussed fo r the following clinical situations:",

However close postoperative imaging is necessary in order to recognize late com plications which often require reinterventions. Late m igrations may occur. Non-surgical candidates are exposed to high mortality risk. Meticulous measurement o f the length and diam eter o f the aneurysm and the proximal and distal neck is important. Spiral-CT angiography and i.a.-DSA with a m arker catheter are most useful fo r these measurements. For safe attachem ent of the stentgraft the proximal neck of the aneurysm has to be at least 15 mm in length and 2 mm sm aller than the graft diameter. Contraindications fo r endolum inal graft placement are tortuous o r narrow iliac arteries, a short or wide proximal neck or throm bus in the aneurysm a neck. Up to 2.5 years follow-up of the first clinical pilot studies have shown that aneurysm s can be treated successfully by stent grafts. However, leaks at the proximal or distal anastom osis, due to graft tears o r lumbar reperfusion are the most common cause of treatm ent failure. It has been dem onstrated that even small leaks might cause enlargement o f the aneurysm . Therefore a strict follow-up program with spiral-CT and immediate occlusion o f leaks by stent grafts or em bolization is mandatory. Graft thrombosis and proxim al instability has been described as well. The technique of graft placement will be explained by video demonstration. Computed tom ography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are the imaging methods of choice in the evaluation of the oropharynx. They offer an ex cellent anatomical delineation and are mainly used in the assessment of tum ors (> 90% squamous cell carcinoma), rarely fo r evaluating inflam matory lesions.

These studies are often requested in order to receive information about the situation to be encountered during surgery, or to be alerted to irresectability or to unexpected metastases outside the initially planned area of exploration. In most surgically treated tumours, the role o f imaging fo r preoperative staging is limited, either due to its insufficient sensitivity, or because the initial treatm ent is independent o f the lymph node stage.

Indications are given fo r additional vieuws and additional techniques. High quality mammography can only be carried out with properly trained radiographers. They have to be able to perform excellent quality mammograms from both the positioning and technical point o f view. The radiographer in addition should possess the social skills to support the woman during the examination, as well as carry out quality assurance procedures. Positioning: Breast positioning is an art. Incorrect positioning is the most common problem when evaluating a m ammogram . The skills required to perform optimal mammographie positioning are high. The standard views are: the cranio-caudal view, and the medio-latero-oblique view. The m ost im portant additional views are: the latero-medial/medio-lateral view; coned down spot view; magnification view; and \"Cleopatra\" view. Quality A ssurance procedures: A technically optimal mammogram is de pendent on a num ber of factors, such as equipment, screen-film combination, cassettes, processing conditions, darkroom, etc. Image quality standards must be established. To maintain the highest standard of image quality, a quality assurance programme has to be implemented. It is the radiographer's duty to carry out quality control procedures, such as performing a phantom image, a sensitometric stepwedge, etc. Teamwork: The team responsible to obtain optimal mammogram s consists of the radiologist, the radiographer and the physicist. The radiographer should participate in the multidisciplinary meetings. Focal pulm onary lesions are am ong the most common findings in daily radiol ogy practice. At imaging, focal lung disease may present as nodular opacity or as a localized area of pulm onary infiltration o r consolidation. C auses of focal lung disease include malignant lesions, such as bronchogenic carcinoma, solitary metastasis, and carcinoid tum ors, or benign abnormalities, such as granuloma, hamartoma, vascular processes, and focal areas of inflammation. Modern imaging techniques are of paramount importance in the detection and classification of these abnormalities. C om pared to plain chest films, CT offers the advantage of providing unique m orphologic clues that may help character ize focal pulm onary processes. MR imaging can aid in tissue characterization, particularly in the identification of vascular lesions. Undoubtedly, the radiologist has a pivotal position in the assessm ent and management of focal pulmonary abnormalities. The role of the radiologist involves the identification of a focal lesion, the selection of the most appropriate imaging techniques to narrow the differential diagnosis, and the steering o f invasive measures that could establish a definite diagnosis. By designing a specific diagnostic approach to a patient's focal lesion, the radiologist serves as the ideal guide who can guarantee a high quality and cost-effective patient care and management. The introduction of high-resolution com puted tom ography (HRCT) has revolu tionized the radiologic approach of patients with suspected diffuse infiltrative S 56 lung disease. Over the last ten years, this technique has enabled precise analysis of the morphological changes occurring at the level of the lung parenchyma as well as better understanding of the distributions of abnorm ali ties. On the basis of close correlations between HRCT findings and pathologic lung abnormalities, it has been possible to clarify the term inology used to describe abnormal CT findings and thus, to avoid non specific terms. An accurate interpretation of HRCT scans requires a detailed understanding of normal lung anatom y and of the pathologic alterations in normal lung that occur in the presence of disease. In addition to the four large categories of HRCT findings in diffuse infiltrative lung disease, the distribution of parenchymal abnormalities must be integrated when attempting to reach a diagnosis or differential diagnosis o f diffuse lung disease using CT. The aim of this lecture is to review the predom inant patterns of lung involvement and the characteristics of lungs changes observed in the most com monly encountered entities. Specific attention is directed to the newly developed protocols using spiral CT technology aimed at identifying mild form s o f lung infiltration. In this State-of-the-Art Symposium 'Ultrasound and 3D Imaging' the novel developments o f 3D echography will be explained. The session is divided into three parts. In the first part the principles o f 3D are explained fo r the organ image acquisition and display methods. Scanning methods include parallel slicing; pivoting or fan-like scanning o r the stepwise rotational image acquisition every few degrees as can be performed with multiplane probes. For moving organs such as the heart, triggering is required. Examples include cardiac as well as vascular 3D imaging. The session will be continued with an explanation of the 3D approach and capabilities for blood velocity imaging. Also here, as in the organ imagine, information must be acquired in multiple known planes. Power Doppler 3D images will be compared with Color Doppler 3D results.",

Novario; Varese/I Conventional ultrasound scanners allow to obtain 2D map of blood velocity in a plane defined by the orientation o f the probe. It is not possible to have information about velocities out of plane. In order to have a com plete understanding of flow disturbances it is necessary to study velocity and shear stress distribution over the whole vessel volume. 3D color Doppler system have been recently proposed, based on the recon struction of the 3D velocity distribution in the volum e of interest, acquiring several 2D color fow mappings in known planes. To obtain different planes, it is possible to move the transducer with a motor-driven hand-held assembly, or to hand-m ove it, with o r without position sensors. The color and grey-scale information o f each 2D image can be separated and the 3D reconstruction can be calculated distinctly. Power Doppler 3D velocity images are better then images obtained with C olor Doppler because of the higher sensitivity of the Power methodology. The acquisition has to be synchronized with the cardiac cycle and an ECG trigger is needed. It is also possible to show tem poral series with the 3D representation of the flow during the whole cardiac cycle. It has be shown that 3D velocity and spatial accuracy is good. The use of ultrasound contrast media in order to increase th e D oppler sensi tivity was recently tested. This leads to an higher signal to noise ratio in the 3D flow mapping. The special acoustic resonance properties of some contrast media make it possible to develop special scanning m ethods m atched to this resonance behaviour. The echo can contain, in addition to the transducer dominant frequency, a strong com ponent of twice the frequency (second har monic). W ith such a method it is conceivable that the 3D detection sensitivity in small vessels could be increased clearly. A method with the capability to directly view the heart and its structures in three-dimensional dimensions (3D), rather than trying to perform mental reconstructions from two-dimensional images, would facilitate and improve understanding o f the dynamic anatom y and com plex pathology. W e developed rotatable transducer system controlled by a com puter-based steering logic considering both heart cycle variations by ECG-gating and respiratory cycle variation by impedance measurement for precordial transesophageal image acquisition. The video output o f the echo system is interfaced with the TomTec Echo-scan system which contains both the steering logic fo r image acquisition and the software fo r 3D reconstruction yielding a dynam ic volum erendered display. In addition, any desired cross-section of the head o r selected structure which cannot be visualized in planes obtainable from standard precordial o r transesophageal transducer positions can be com puted and displayed in cine loop format at 25 frames/sec (anyplane echocardiography). Electronic parallel slicing through the volum e data set allows the generation of equidistant cross-sections (paraplane echocardiography). These capabilities allow the accurate measurement of specific structures such as orifice areas of valves and chamber volum es independent from geom etric assum ptions. Our experience includes now more than 250 patients and we w ere able to obtain dynamic 3D images displaying aodic and mitral valve lesions, prosthetic valves and mass lesions in projections not available from two-dim ensional echocardiography. 3D reconstruction clearly facilitates the study of structures of unknown o r com plex geom etry such as the right ventricle, the atria, aneurysm atic ventricles in patients with coronary artery disease and congenital heart disease. More accurate measurements o f cardiac cham ber volum e are now possible independent from geometric assumptions. Comparison between 3D echo and MRI showed excellent correlation and 3D derived volum e measurement achieved a 2 -3 fold improvem ent over single and biplane area length measurement in term s of intra-and interobserver variability. Three-dimensional echocardiography may ultimately become the best ap proach to study the anatom y and pathology of the heart as it provides an objective display of cardiac size and shape throughout the cardiac cycle. The surgeon can now have a look in advance at w hat he will find during surgery, but with the additional information on function. A logical extension of 3D echocardiography will be its merging with color D oppler flow. W ith further developm ents in com puter technology the image quality and display facilities will improve and more importantly the reconstruction tim e decrease making the technique more practical.

Nakanishi; Osaka/J Purpose: To evaluate the anatom ical detail of ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) of elbow, we examined MRI of the cadaveric elbow joint. Subjects and Methods: Three fresh cadavers were performed MRI. Pulse sequences were spin-echo (SE) T 1 -weighted images (400 msec/15 msec.) and SE proton density and T2-weighted images (2000/20, 90). All Elbows were performed MRI w hen the elbow w as extended, and when the elbow was flexed 90 degree, 10 ml saline MR arthrography of both extended and flexed. Slice direction was coronal parallel to the humeral shaft. Slice thickness was 3 mm. After MRI, the anatomical findings were confirmed and after resecting one bundle of UCL (two posterior bundle and one anterior bundle), MRI was performed again. Results: In all three cadavers, UCL revealed as one bundle of low intensity band when the elbow was extended. In tw o of three cadavers, UCL revealed as two separate band o f low intensity when the elbow was flexed. MRI after resecting one bundle proved these tw o separate low intensity bands are anterior bundle and posterior bundle and anterior bundle w as larger than posterior. Methods and Materials: Twenty-two patients (mean age 58 yrs \u00b1 28) with X-ray findings of single o r multiple I ALB of the knee (n = 13), ankle (n = 1). hand (n = 1), shoulder (n = 2) and elbow (n = 5) w ere prospectively studied with 7 .5 -1 3 MHz US. Twenty patients had osteoarthritis, one osteonecrosis of the knee and one osteochondritis dissecans of the talus. Diagnosis was confirmed with arthrography, C T arthrography and CT. Results: In all patients, US identified IALB as hyperechoic images with posterior shadowing usually located in a joint recess. Anechoic synovial effusion surrounded IALB in 16 cases. Synovial folds coexisted in 5 cases at knee and elbow. Visualization of motility of IALB was consistently enhanced by examining the patient in both recumbent o r upright position and applying some pressure on the joint with the probe. Results: In contrast to the 1.5 T examination the effects at 0.2 T remained relatively localized and allowed visualization of clinical im portant structures in all cases.

MRI showed the presence of an aneurysm at the site of the dacron patch in 6 patients; the age at surgical repair o f these patients was significantly different com pared with the group of patients with no aneurysm al dilatation (12.6 \u00b1 2.4 years vs 7.5 \u00b1 3.4 years; p < 0.05). Echocardiography did not identify postoperative patch aneurysm in 4 cases (4/6). At the TT, 5 of these patients (5/6) were found to have a severe systemic hypertension on effort with a significantly higher pulse pressure (p < 0.001 ).",

Drouillard; Pessac/F Purpose: Assessing the ability of TOE, CT and MR imaging in the diagnosis and follow -up of acute aortic dissection (AAD) without intimai tear. Material and Methods: One twenty consecutive cases of AAD were reviewed in order to determ ine the prevalence and imaging findings at TOE, CT and MR imaging of those without com municating true and false channel o r with a mural hematoma. Clinical and imaging follow-up of AAD without intimai tear was also considered. Results: Eighteen patients were found to have a strong suspicion of AAD without intimai tear with the following findings at TOE: broad mural thickening superior to 7 mm without intimai flap or false channel. CT (n = 12) and MRI (n = 14) showed acute mural hematomas in respectively 50% and 78%. Three cases (type A) were confirmed surgically and the others followed up. Followup (mean 32 months) showed com plete resolution (20%), stability (60%) or relapse with intimai tear (20% In one case Ga-SPECT was false negative, CT showed 3 false negative results and 5 areas with doubtful activity. In 6 patients with residual masses, the decision between partial remission and further high dose chemotherapy o r com plete remission with residual fibrosis and \"wait and see\" therapy management w as directly influenced by the result of the Ga-67-SPECT. Conclusions: Ga-67-SPECT is a valuable diagnostic tool for the differenti ation of residual masses of Hodgkin's lymphoma or high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Because of the wide spread use of potential curative high dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplantation, the detection of residual disease by radioisotopes such as Ga-67 may well become more important.",

Gourevitch; M oscow/CIS Modern tendencies to organ-preserving treatm ent of early stage lung cancer have carried out the problem of early diagnosis of loco-regional recurrences. Especially after adjuvant irradiation. Before the year 1990 in 910 cases stage I lung cancer was pathologically defined (pTIS -3, pT1 -375, pT2 -532). In 88.3% surgical patients (including hilar type) the lobe o r whole lung was preserved. Conservative (limited) resections underwent 167 patients, including I I with segmental bronchus tum our (bronchoplastic segmentectomy). In 512 (56.2%) cases adjuvant radiation therapy have been executed. Combined organ-preserving treatm ent (bronchoplastic lobectomy, limited resections and radiation therapy) results in decreasing of local recurrence incidence. Pul monary fibrosis connected with irradiation developed after lobectomy in 20% cases without significant connection to bronchoplasty and in 12.3% after con servative surgery. Specificity of radiological diagnosis in cases of recurrences and pneumonitis was essentially diminished. Experience of radiological mon itoring of patients for 25 years after organ-preserving surgery is considered.

Materials and Methods: Eighty-eight CT scans (77 without and 11 with IV contrast injection) o f 33 patients who had pneum onectom y fo r malignant disease (carcinoma n = 29, mesothelioma n = 3, malignant carcinoid n = 1) were reviewed. The wall and content of post pneum onectom y space (PPS), bronchial stump, mediastinum including esophagus and extrapleural space were evaluated. Results: Tumor recurrence occurred in 12 patients (in and around the bronchial stum p n = 4, within PPS manifested by increased fluid n = 3, bleeding n = 2, masses over the inner wall o f thorax n = 1 and extra pleural space n = 2). Additional findings were esophageal fistula (n = 2), bronchopleu ral fistula (n = 1), acute empyema in the immediate post operative period (n = 5), chronic empyema (n = 2). All patients with acute em pyem a or acute exacerbation of chronic em pyema had feve r and high WBC. Inhomogeneity o f the fluid in PPS, slight irregularities o r contrast enhancem ent o f its walls occurred with equal frequency in patients who had recurrence and in those w ho did not. Conclusion: In this series recurrence around bronchial stum p and within PPS occurred with equal frequency. Unless there are discrete nodules o r masses, slight irregularities of the inner wall of PPS, and inhomogeneity of fluid within PPS, except for bleeding, are normal findings. Increased fluid within PPS may be either due to tum or recurrence o r acute em pyema, but the latter is associated with high fever and elevated WBC.

They were performed with a slice thickness of 5 mm before and after contrast medium with an incremental technique. Results: Among 57 cases, only 17 have been identified on the rapport and 11 were retrospectively detected after reviewing. Overall 28 cases were detected (49.1% of cases). The size of the main tum or ranges from 3 to 5 cm. The size of the second tum or ranged from one half inferior to 1 cm and the other between 1 to 3 cm. The third one was always inferior to 1.5 cm. The number of tumor was exact in 19 cases. 9 cases were underestimated. The size of unvisible tum ors ranged from few millimeters to 1 cm.

Spectral Doppler of the portal vein (doses 0 .6 -4 .8 ml: n = 40) and power Doppler o f the right kidney (doses 0 .1 5 -1 .2 ml: n = 44) were performed. All scans were subjectively evaluated by an experienced blinded observer. Using in-house software, intensity of the portal vein spectral Doppler was averaged over 1 s intervals and plotted against time. The area under the resultant time-spectral intensity cun/e (AUC) was calculated fo r each injection after normalisation for variation between subjects. Results: Tolerance was excellent. Subjectively, good and consistent enhance ment was seen with all doses: mean useable enhancement was 9 m ins for spectral and 5 mins fo r color Doppler. Minimal color blooming and no self shadowing were seen. AUC values correlated much better with dosage than subjective evaluation and a linear fit with the mean AUC fo r all subjects showed an R2 = 0.97. Conclusion: BR1 is a safe and effective agent.

The purpose of this study was to investigate if a continuous infusion over up to 15 minutes can provide uniform and prolonged enhancement. Materials and Methods: 6 volunteers each received 3 infusions of Levovist over 4 -1 5 min at: 1) \"standard\" rate calculated individually for each subject (1 .8 -2 .4 ml/min,). 2) 'la s t'' rate at tw ice the \"standard\" rate. 3) \"slow\" rate at half the \"standard\" rate. Doppler intensitometry of spectral traces of the femoral artery and subjective analysis of carotid colour Doppler were performed. Results: All infusions provided enhancement with a uniform plateau phase starting after 0 .5 -2 .5 min lasting till the end of the infusion. Depending on the infusion rate, enhancem ent was < 20 min. Enhancement at the plateau was 19.5 \u00b1 2 dB (\"standard\" rate), 21.5 \u00b1 2 dB (\"fast\" rate) and 16.5 \u00b1 2 dB (\"slow\" rate). Saturation artefacts were minimal. Conclusion: Continuous infusion of Levovist provided marked, prolonged and uniform enhancem ent of Doppler signals and improved image quality by minimizing saturation artefacts. It promises to be useful especially in the enhancem ent of larger body areas. Results: In all patients studied, the acquisition protocol led to diagnostic images.

Furthermore the influence o f the in jection rate on dilution has been evaluated in order to calculate the attenuation of Gd-DTPA to be expected in vivo. Results: Gd-DTPA is more efficient than iodine in the spectral attenuation, especially at a tube voltage o f 80 kV. An injection of a 0.7 molar solution of Gd-DTPA at 4.5 ml/sec. was calculated to be equivalent to that of a 2.36 molar solution of iodine at a lower flow rate (3 ml/sec.). Only a sufficient enhancement of arterial vessel and the thyroid can be achieved through the presently available concentration o f Gd-DTPA (0.5 mol/l). Conclusion: In regard to an optimization o f the scan start through HUsensitive triggering as well as the capability of using a higher dosage of 1.0 molar Gd-DTPA, the future application of Gd-DTPA as a CT contrast medium fo r displaying blood vessels and possible hypervascular lesions appears to be sensible in cases w here there are contraindications to the use of iodine. Presently the application of 0.5 m olar Gd-DTPA should be limited to DSA. Results: MRI with contrast-enhancement detected more lesions altogether (in dependent of size and location) than the other imaging modes.

Conclusions: Time-consuming and cost-intensive MRI with RES-specific supraparamagnetic contrast agent increases the rate of detectibility fo r ma lignant liver lesions only slightly over the rate achieved through quicker and considerably less expensive CT-Double-Spiral techniques.

Prefiltering with a LUM-sharpener (3 x 3 kernel) increased the detected volume by 18% (threshold) to 20% (local minima detection). Maximum performance was achieved by a combination of both methods. Pathologic findings could be reliably displayed up to 3rd-order bronchi. Up to 5th-order bronchi could be visualized. Conclusion: Autom atic extraction of the tracheobronchial tree is feasible. Applying appropriate scan protocols, our algorithm provides the means fo r 3D display o f bronchi up to the 5th order.",

            "text": "360 Spiral CT angiography of abdominal aortic aneurysms: Which rendering technique should be used? U. Szeimies, C.-P. Wallner, B. Steckmeier, G. K\u00fcffer, R. Scheck, T. Pfluger, K. Hahn; Munich/D Purpose: We prospectively evaluated the diagnostic impact of three different rendering techniques o f \u0421\u0422\u0410 datas: surface-shaded-display (SSD), maximumintensity-projection (MIP) and volum e rendering (VR). Material and Methods: 42 patients with abdom inal aortic aneurysm s (AAA) underwent \u0421\u0422\u0410. For golden standard intraarterial DSA (100%) was used. For com parison of SSD, MIP and VR same viewing angles as DSA images were performed. The rendered images were correlated with 2 D axial C T slices and i.a. DSA by three unbiased radiologists and the vascular surgeon. Results: Best evaluation of vascular anatom y and was provided with volume rendering. All information of SSD and MIP could be rendered with different opacity settings by VR. In assessing the presence and configuration of stenoses (renal n = 5, iliac n = 7) o r accessory renal arteries (n = 5) VR was superior to MIP and SSD with 98% correlation to DSA (87%, 71%). In depicting segmental renal arteries MIP and VR w ere equal, the evaluation o f spatial resolution o f vessel kinking SSD and VR were equal. VR uniquely displayed mural throm bus and exact configuration o f mural calcium. Conclusion: Volume rendering seems to be an important reconstruction technique of \u0421\u0422\u0410 datas and should be used in preoperative vessel imaging. Materials and Methods: 3D interactive matching (IM) and 3D surface match ing (SM) were performed in tw o phantom studies and 50 examinations of pediatric abdominal masses. IM was performed on a Picker Voxel Q worksta tion, and SM on a Hewlett Packard workstation using a modified Pelizzari's algorithm. SM was based on 3D surface models of the liver and/or kidney (after labelling with MAG3) in both modalities. Matching accuracy was verified by measuring maximum deviation of anatom ical landmarks and/or external fiducials. Results: Matching accuracy in patient studies was 0.8 cm \u00b1 0.2 cm fo r IM, and 0.9 cm \u00b1 0.3 cm fo r SM. However, in 19/50 cases, SM failed because of a congruency less than 75% o f segmented surfaces. This w as especially the case in patients with liver metastases. IM succeeded in all patients. Mean time demand fo r IM was 15 minutes, for SM 25 min. The interobserver variability for the operator dependent IM method was less than 5%. Conclusion: Due to the sufficient accuracy, high success rate, and accept able tim e demand, IM is our preferred image fusion technique in abdominal examinations. Purpose: CT-Angiography is at a high diagnostic quality by using different ways to display patholgigal structures. To get comprehensive information, different representations related to specific findings o f interest are necessary: To create angiographic images with comprehensive information Maximum Intensity Projections (MIP) are not enough. Multiplanar Image Reconstructions (MPR) and Three Dimensional Surface Display (3D) have to be done to find out which secondary image reconstruction is necessary related to specified cases. Methods and Materials: W e examined 70 patients with changes in the ves sels or tumorous form ations in the abdomen. W e used a Spiral-CT scanner (Somatom Plus4 Siemens), scan time: 60 seconds, slice thickness 3 mm, pitch: 1.5, rotation tim e 0.75 seconds. Up to 36 cm o f craniocaudal length could be documented. The stored raw data enabled an overlapping image reconstruction. Results: For preoperative planning the arterial vascular anatom y is well displayed in the MIP-images, the venous system can be identified best with MPR. In aneurysm s MIP and MPR showes in all cases the remaining blood supplied lumen, the calcifications and the thrombosed aneurysm atic sac. High graded stenoses o f the renal vessels can be acquired with MIP and MPR, the determination of the the degree of the stenosis is not possible. 3D-lm aging does an evaluation of the surface of blood vessels and the topograpy between vessels and bone structures. Conclusion: \u0421\u0422\u0410 known as MIP-imaging has to be used in the context with MPR and 3D from the raw data set to confirm the diagnosis. The com pre hensive information is the strength o f this method and a great advantage compared with MRI and MRI-angiography. Purpose: Percutaneous liver biopsy was to be carried out on asymptomatic hepatitis \u0421 virus positive patients to detect and monitor subsequent progres sion of and response to treatm ent o f liver disease. W e sought to examine the role o f image guidance during percutaneous liver biopsy, and to iden tify the type and size of autom ated biopsy needles that yielded adequate histopathological specimens while m aintaining low patient morbidity. Methods and Materials: 100 patients had ultrasound guided percutaneous liver biopsy carried out by experienced Ultrasonologists using a variety of automated biopsy needles. A further 100 patients had blind percutaneous biopsy. Patient morbidity was recorded. Cadaveric liver biopsy using the same range of devices was carried out on 50 recently (< 2 hrs) post mortem subjects who did not have liver disease ante mortem. All specim ens were blindly assessed for pathologic adequacies by an experienced Hepatopathologist. Results: 15 Gauge needles consistently yielded more satisfactory specimens in terms of the core thickness and num ber of portal tracts visualised. With needles o f 18 gauge and less the specim ens showed increased fragmentation, and the core thickness w as less than the diam eter o f liver acini, rendering assessment of liver architecture difficult. Pathological findings did not vary sig nificantly between patient and cadaver specimens. Morbidity following guided and blind procedures was compared. Conclusion: Image guidance conferred benefit during percutaneous liver biopsy with significant reduction in patient morbidity. 15 gauge devices yield more satisfactory histopathological specim ens while maintaining low patient morbidity. Material and Methods: Ten patients with suspected or recurrent lymphomas were referred for a biopsy of retroperitoneal lymph nodes. C T examination of the abdomen performed prior to percutaneous biopsy was unable to find a clear anatom ic pathway from the skin to the intended target. W e tried to displace bowel loops intervening in the expected needle pathway with a custom-designed com pression system com posed o f a perforated bowl and adjustable straps encompassing the patients abdomen. The bowl w as applied at the entry site o f the biopsy needle. Results: Successful accurate placement of the biopsy needle within retroperi toneal mass w as achieved in all patients, avoiding traversing bowel loops. Our com pression system allowed displacem ent of digestive structures, and shortened the distance between the skin and the target by 20 to 50%. Conclusion: Abdominal compression is a valuable aid to CT-guided biopsy o f deep retroperitoneal lesions via anterior route, as it allow s a more direct approach than angling the needle. It is also technically sim pler and less invasive than injecting gas o r saline to displace digestive structures. Conclusions: Ultrasound guided infusional brachytheraphy using 32P colloid is safe with few side effects and the potential to give com plete remission. The dose/response relationship is unknown. In our small material a total radiation dose exceeding 8000 Gy has given the highest num ber o f responses. In the remaining 11 cases non diagnostic specimens were obtained. Of the 33 CTguided biopsies performed in the group of patients with suspect recurrences of disease, the correct diagnosis was made in 16/23 (70%) cases o f patients with primary tum or of the large bowel. In the group of 10 patients with prim ary gastric adenocarcinoma, CT-guided biopsy correctly identified recurrence of disease in 7/10 cases.",

Visual evaluation of the 5 sequences w as done by tw o experienced radiologists using a 5-point rating scale (W ilcoxon m atchedpairs signed-rank test). Evaluation criteria were a): delineation of the lesion and b): contrast between lesion and surrounding tissue. Results T2-SPIR offers the highest sensitivity, best delineation and contrast of lesions in comparison to all other sequences (45 superior, 18 equal, 5 inferior, p < 0.001). The contrast between lesion and fat tissue was equivalent with T1-SE compared with T1-Gd-SPIR, but T1-Gd-SPIR offers a superior contrast between lesion and muscle tissue.

For 2D TOF, 3D TOF and 3D PC MRA images noncompensated reading resulted in 70% , 55% , and 50%, while com pensated reading gave 80%, 77% and 75% agreem ent with angiography respectively. Statistically significant differences were found only between the accuracy of \u0421\u0422\u0410 + source image and all noncom pensated MRA readings. The authors suggest US-guided percutaneous sclerotherapy with 95% ethanol in the treatm ent of the lateral cysts of the neck (branchial cysts), as an alternative treatm ent to surgery which has a high incidence of recurrence and iatrogenic complications. Materials and Methods: 5 patients ranging in age from 10 to 72 years old (2 men and 3 women) underwent the procedure. US exam and cytology were performed in the 5 patients to confirm the diagnosis o f branchial cyst. At diagnosis, the cyst volum e varied between 15 and 25 ml. After diagnosis with the patient's informed consent, US-guided empting o f the cyst with 18 G needle was performed. The cyst was filled with 95% ethanol up to 15 ml for 20 minutes and aspirated. The procedure w as repeated three times with a week interval. The follow-up has varied from 6 to 36 months. An anti-inflammatory oral therapy with FANS w as added during treatment. Results: After treatm ent the cyst volume was reduced at about 3 to 5 ml and this volum e was mantained during the follow-up. In 3/5 of patients we have noticed the appearance of a transitory tumescence of the neck, which disappeared during a week, and in 1/5 the tumescence was accompanied by a reactive lymphadenopathy. Conclusions: US-guided percutaneous sclerotherapy of branchial cysts is a low cost procedure alternative to surgery which is more expensive and burne. Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT (600 MBq Tc-99m sestamibi) in patients with primary (n = 60) and recurrent (n = 30) squam ous cell cancer and lymphoma was compared to bone scintigraphy, CT and MRI. The results were related to the surgical and/or pathohistological workup. Sestamibi SPECT provided a 100% sensitivity in the detection of prim ary and recurrent tum or tissue and was in selected cases superior (1) to bone SPECT in differentiating periostitis from m alignant infiltration, (2) to C T in differentiating inflammatory from malignant lymph node and soft tissue infiltration and differentiating viable from non-viable tum or tissue during radio-chemotherapy and (3) to MRI in excluding neoplastic infiltration of the brain. The limitations of sestamibi SPECT com prised the high physiologic uptake in the salivary glands and in the nasal and gingival mucosa. Nevertheless, comparison with the physiological patterns of tracer distribution and quantitative analysis (tumor: background = 11.2 \u00b1 14.3, tum ornuchal muscles = 3.0 \u00b1 1.5, tumor:salivary glands = 1.0 \u00b1 0.4, tumor:mucosa = 2.1 \u00b1 1.4) lead to a correct diagnosis in all cases.

Methods and Materials: MR imaging was performed on a 1.5 T wholebody scanner (Siemens, Erlangen) using the standard body resonator. For the continuous dynamic imaging of cervical spine movement different pulse sequence schemes based on gradient echo acquisitions were evaluated. The goal thereby was to obtain a satisfactory representation o f the myelon, CSF and the intervertebral discs, while providing a sufficient tem poral resolution to get an artefact free recording o f spine movement. A simple guiding device was developed, which allows a free movement of the investigated subject along a well defined sagittal plan. Results: Fast 2D-FISP sequences (TR = 6 ms, TE = 2.8 ms, Flip angle: 35\u00b0) were found to give the best contrast between CSF and myelon while still showing the intervertebral discs. To guarantee shortest possible acquisition times reduced scan matrixes were used. To maintain good contrast between CSF and myelon the acquisition matrix has to be 94 x 128 o r higher. Usually 1 0 -2 0 images were acquired successively within 5 -1 0 sec. Conclusions: Fast 2D-FISP sequences with optimized scan parameters were found to be suitable fo r real-time MRI of the cervical spine allowing the assessment of functional aspects of spine movement. Methods: X-rays and MRI of the sacroiliac joints (SIJ) were performed in 130 children subdivided to following groups according to modified European S pondyloarthropathy Study Group (ESSG) criteria: group 1: undifferentiated SpA (uSpA n = 41, 88% HLA B27+), group 2: differentiated SpA (n = 29, 97% HLA B27+), group 3: patients with no signs of SpA other than oligoarthritis (n = 30, 93% HLA B27+), group 4: HLA B27+ controls without arthritis (n = 12) and group 5: HLA B27-controls with other \u043f\u043e\u043f-SpA diagnoses (n = 18).

W hen medical students are introduced to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) they may enjoy the beauty and the diagnostic content of the images but may be frightened by the physics o f MRI. In order to increase the curiosity of the students on MRI physics I have given an introductory lecture in an animated style. The lecture gives the background of the MRI signals (electromagnetic waves radiating out of the human body) and describes how they induce electrical currents in the antenna of an MRI machine. The currents are analyzed in a com puter with regard to frequencies and amplitudes (Fourier analysis). The com puter presents this analysis as images which get an astonishing resemblance to human anatomy. To make the Fourier analysis easier to grasp for the students they are reminded that they as biologic machines in their eyes make Fourier analysis of a spectrum of electromagnetic waves called light and in their ears (organ of Corti) make Fourier analysis of a spectrum of sound waves radiating out from the vocal cords of a talking man (or woman) o r from a playing symphony orchestra... I will give a shortened version of my introductory lecture. Conventional MRI of the spine featuring sagittal and axial T t -and T 2-weighted imaging sequences is a highly sensitive method of demonstrating lumbar disc herniation. The specificity of the findings leaves much to be desired however: incidental findings o f herniated discs are frequently reported in asymptomatic individuals. Besides imaging the potential cause o f nerve root com pression (the herniated disc) it is also necessary to depict the actual compressed root with the highest resolution. Previously the gold standard fo r imaging the intradural nerve root and root sleeve has been myelography (syn. radiculography) involving a lumbar puncture and injection of a contrast medium. Lately a num ber o f refinements o f MRI technique have made it possible to produce high-quality non-invasive MR myelograms. A number of these techniques will be discussed.",

For this reason and fo r other, there is, particularly in Europe, a continuing trend to minimize the surgical treatm ent of the disc in those particular patients w here a quick treatm ent is unavoidable (intractable pain, imperious necessity to rapid return to work....). New techniques continue to be devised fo r treating the lum bar disc but com parisons are difficult. Concerning laser discectomy, too little work has been published to evaluate this technic in term of efficacy and safety. Automated percutaneous lumbar discectomy seem s on the decline yet: a long term success rate of about only 55% even with meticulous patient selection makes it poorly attractive. Chemopapain chem onucleolysis (CNL) is nowadays more and more popular: it can be predicted from the drug sales that more than 10,000 patients with lumbar disc herniation are treated each year in Europe with CNL. With the general use of a safe extradural approach, none neurological com plications has been reported in the last few years. Management of rare anaphylactic reactions is well known. Short hospitalization time, absence of skin opening o r blood loss, absence o f general anesthesia, acceptable time for return to work make chemonucleolysis attractive in those patients whose lumbar diseased disc has to be treated. Imaging technics remain essential fo r patient selection. Purpose: This study was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of spiral arthro-CT (SACT) after 3-compartment w rist-arthrography (AG) to dem onstrate various im portant non-osseous wrist structures including capsule, ligaments, triangular fibrocartilage as well as cartilage. Methods and Materials: 5 wrist specim ens of 4 different subjects were exam ined by AG and SACT (512 x 512 matrix, 96 mm FOV, 1 mm slice thickness, 1:1 helix in the axial and semi-coronal plane and further recontructions in the sagittal and true-coronal plane). In order to code the 3 different wrist com part ments different colors were mixed with contrast material before injection. Then the non-decalcified specimens were em bedded in w ater and deep-frozen to an ice block. Afterwards rotation cryotomy w as performed in 1 of the 3 possi ble main anatom ic planes (axial, coronal and sagittal). Each cryosection was photographed and relevant anatom ic structures were directly correlated with the imaged CT morphology. Results: Following im portant non-osseous structures were constantly seen in all specimens:",

Methods and Materials: In total 120 wrist joints were examined by AG utilizing digital subtraction during injection as well as digital stress images. Immediately afterwards SACT (512 x 512 matrix, 96 mm FOV, 1 mm slice thickness, 1:1 helix) was performed in the axial and semi-coronal plane with further reconstructions in the sagittal and true-coronal plane. 2 different observers analysed overall detection of 11 major wrist ligaments and the TFC as well as additional findings of SACT com pared to AG. Results: Following detection rates for 11 major wrist ligaments and the TFC were observed: TFC 100%, SL 92%, LT 78%, RCL 89% , RC 84% , RL 88%, RSL 49% , ULT 65% , dRT 49% , DIG 84%, TH 60%, CH 44% . Following additional findings of SACT com pared to AG were noted: 5x central TFC defects, 6x foveal avulsion o f the TFC, 2x RL tear, 2x ULT tear, 3x RCL tear as well as 23x chondromalacia. Due to SACT a 55% decrease of studies with unremarkable findings was noted compared to AG alone. Conclusion: SACT defines better the extent and location of the ligament or TFC injury com pared to AG alone, additionally SACT also displays chondro malacia. Therefore wrist arthrography should always be followed by SACT in order to gain more anatom ic and clinical information. 14:20 3 9 9 Triangular fibrocartilage and intercarpal ligam ents of the wrist: Standard MR im aging versus MR arthrography M.

Hof, R Gerhardt; Munich/D Purpose: C orrect timing o f surgery is an important factor fo r longterm success in the treatm ent of patients with Dupuytrens contracture (DC). If inflammatory activity is present at surgery the recurrence rate of contractures is known to be significant. Methods: W e exam ined 20 patients with clinically evident DC in a low field dedicated MR-System (Artoscan) at 0.2 T. Axial T 1 and T2 weighted spinecho sequences (3 mm slice thickness) of the palm s and fingers as well as isotropic 3D gradient echo sequences with secondary reconstruction (1.8 mm) were acquired. IV contrast media (Gadolinium 0.2 ml/kg) were given before the repeat of the T1 weighted axial sequence. Signal intensity in T2 weighting and enhancement after GD were noted and the grade o f inflammatory activity was determined. 16 patients were operated and the excised tissue was examined histopathologically. Results: MRI results and histopathologic proof of inflam matory activity cor related well in 15/16 patients. T1 weighted sequences before and after GD proved to be m ost valuable. T2 weighted sequences were helpful if tissue edem a or effusion was present. The 3D GE thin slice images did not help in grading inflam matory activity. Conclusion: The low field dedicated system is well suited fo r screening DC patients preoperatively. If high grade inflammatory activity is noted surgery can be postponed to reduce the incidence of recurrent lesions.",

The aim of our w ork is to evaluate the high frequency US in the study of normal palm ar aponeurosis and its appearance in D upuytren's disease. Methods and Materials: 11 normal subjects (age range 2 2 -7 3 yrs) and 13 patients with clinically assessed multifocal Dupuytren's disease (age range 5 8 -7 9 yrs), graded in 4 stages according to the simplified classification by Tubiana, were examined with high frequency probes (10, 1 5 -2 0 MHz). Results: US identifies the palm ar aponeurosis as a subtle hyperechoic band located under the subcutaneous fat tissue. All the nodules clinically identified were described by US as hypoechoic lesions located in the subcutaneous tissues with variable length (3 -8 mm) well defined from the flexor tendons sheath. In 7/13 patients US assessed a diffuse swelling of the longitudinal bundles of the palm ar aponeurosis. Conclusions: US is able to detect the palm ar aponeurosis and to identify its appearance in Dupuytren's disease. From our results it seem s to be possible the use of US fo r staging and follow-up monitoring of Dupuytren disease. with clinical suspicion of a scaphoid fracture (< 7 days) but normal plain radio graphs.

Methods and Material: 16 wrists o f 13 patients with pain and radiographic depiction of cystic changes within the lunate o r clinical suspicion of a ganglioncyst were examined. The MRI protocol included coronal, sagittal and in 5 cases axial T1-and T2-weighted SE sequences (4 mm slices, 140 FOV, 256 X 256 matrix) as well as coronal fat suppressed gradient-echo-sequences (2 mm slices). Final diagnosis was confirmed by surgery (n = 6) and follow up. Results: Ganglion cysts (n = 6) were lobulated, showed septae and intraosseous extension in 4 cases. In 3 cases we found a stalk originating from the scaphoid-lunate (SL) ligam ent with SL-instability in one case. In ulnar impaction syndrome (n = 1) small cystic lesions in the lunate were surrounded by a sclerotic rim and located near the proximal ulnar surface. In Kienb\u00f6ck's disease (n = 3) cystic com ponents were irregular and surrounded by bone marrow edema. Nutrient vessel canals (n = 7) imaged as 1 to 3 small cystic lesions within the palm ar or dorsal subchondral region. Conclusion: MRI can aid in differential diagnosis of cystic carpal lesions. N utrient vessel canals may not be mistaken fo r pathologic cystic lesions. Carpal ganglion cysts show distinct diagnostic pattern and can cause SL instability. ",

Spiral-CT-Scans were carried out using double detector technique: reconstruction interval 1.3 mm, 2.5 mm thickness, 10 mm/sec, t = 60 sec, Vol.: 60 cm, CM-applikation 30 sec before scanning, total V.: 140 ml, Flow 4 mm/sec. After processing, images were transmitted via a local network to our workstation (Silicon Graphic Indigo II). Results: In all cases virtual angioscopy could be established by the use of special explorer programs. Angioscopic simulation w as carried out in real time and by video documentation. Vascular plaques and residual stenoses, respec tively could be well visualized. Typical clinical cases will be demonstrated and correlated with the conventional angioscopic findings. Conclusion: Virtual reality angioscopy based on double detector spiral-CT is a promising and non-invasive procedure to dem onstrate vascular pathology comparable to conventional angioscopy. However, further studies have to prove the clinical impact to this new diagnostic modality. To present the results of percutaneous fenestration in patients with lower limb ischaemia following aortic dissection. Materials and Methods: W e present four cases (2 male, 2 female) with ischaemia to a lower limb as a result of com prom ise to the aortic bifurcation by an aortic dissection flap. One patient developed an aortic dissection following aortic valve surgery. A nother had an iatrogenic ilio-aortic dissection created at the time of cardiac catheterisation. The other tw o cases were spontaneous aortic dissections, one patient required surgery after fenestration fo r their type A dissection. All were treated with percutaneous fenestration with a 10 mm angioplasty balloon. The technique of fenestration will be discussed. The patients were followed up with duplex ultrasound imaging o r intravenous digital subtraction angiography. Results: All patients had initially successful fenestration. O ne died as a result of com plications following aortic surgery for a type A dissection. Two had improvement of symptoms at follow up and imaging showed patency of the fenestration. The other patient required repeat fenestration because of recurrence of critical ischaemia in one low er limb. This patient developed acute renal failure and died 2 days after the repeat fenestration. Conclusion: Percutaneous fenestration can be helpful in the m anagem ent of patients with iatrogenic or spontaneous aortic dissections com prom ising the low er limbs. Purpose: Selection of cutoff points (HU) representing \"em physem a\" is crucial when using com puterized quantification. W e wanted to analyze the influence o f slice thickness and reconstruction algorithm. Material and Methods: Eight healthy men were examined. Slices w ere taken at the carina, 3 cm above and 3 cm below with thicknesses of 1.5, 5 and 10 mm. Images were reconstructed with sharp, standard and smooth algorithm s. The images were analyzed using density masking. The upper limit fo r the mask was varied from -8 7 0 to -9 7 0 HU the low er w as constant at -1 0 3 0 HU. The density mask area was considered representing a percentage \"em physem a\" of the entire lung area. Curves were constructed com bining the percentage \"emphysema\" fo r each mask. Results: Slice thickness had more marked influence on the measurements than reconstruction algorithm. Using the same density mask and sharp recon struction algorithm a 15% larger area would have been considered emphyse matous with a slice thickness of 1.5 mm than with a 10 mm. Use o f a sharp S87 algorithm resulted in a 10% larger area than use o f standard o r smooth a t a slice thickness of 1.5 mm.

This method could be a very im portant tool in the pre-operative assessm ent of severe emphysema. Methods and Materials: Based on single self-organizing neural networks a hierarchical three-level, highly sensitive neural network was developed. GG was defined as an amorphous, extensive property with -7 5 1 HU < GG < -2 9 9 HU. The network w as trained on 10 HRCT scans with and without GG. 120 HRCT scans of 20 patients with suspected pulm onary disease were evaluated prospectively. The network's performance was checked by a radiologist. Frequency and extent of false positive and false negative (not detected) areas of GG w as estimated as percentage of the total area involved. Results: Sensitivity of GG detection by neural networks was 100%, specificity 29% , positive predictive value 83%, negative predictive value 100%. The extent o f true positive GG areas was underestimated by approx. 5% due to delim itation from denser areas (vessels, pleura). Partial volum es (vessels, pleura, diaphragm) and motion artifacts were responsible fo r the low specificity. If only areas > 50 pixels were included the specificity rose to 52%. Conclusion: Autom atic detection and quantification of GG by hierarchical neural networks is sufficiently accurate. Small areas are insignificant, typical pitfalls are partial volum es and motion. This study was designed to investigate the relationship between the am ount of air-trapping as measured on inspiratory and expiratory CT and the degree of air-flow obstruction measured by lung function testing in asthm atic patients. Previous work using a sem i-quantitative CT technique has suggested a relationship between air-trapping on C T and the am ount of airway obstruction on lung function testing. A quantitative C T technique has been devised to investigate this relationship. Methods: 20 patients with severe, chronic stable asthm a had CT scans (1.5 mm sections) on full inspiration and at end-expiration. Cross-sectional area of the lungs w as calculated using an electronic planimeter. A change in cross S88 sectional lung area was calculated by dividing the area a t end-expiration by the area a t end-inspiration and expressing it as a percentage. The asthmatic group was com pared with a group of 50 normal controls i.e. normal CT scans with normal lung function.

Material and Methods: On tw o consecutive days, spirometrie gated CT sec tions were obtained from tw enty hospitalized patients, at 5 cm above and 5 cm below the carina, and at 90% and 10% of the vital capacity. The first CT examination was performed by a radiologist, the second by a technician. The mean, modal and median lung density were calculated as well as the lowest and the highest 10th percentile of the frequency distribution o f CT numbers, its full width at half maximum, and the pixel index. These lung density parameters of corresponding sections of both studies were compared. Reproducibility was expressed as the standard deviation of the signed difference between results of day 1 and day 2 divided by root o f 2. Results: At 90% vital capacity, reproducibility was in both lung zones on the order of 3 -1 4 HU. At 10% vital capacity reproducibility w as worse by approximately a factor of three. Conclusion: Objective m easurement of lung density at spirometrie controlled levels of inspiration is a reproducible method in assessing pulm onary density. At 90% vital capacity the most reproducible CT lung density measurements can be obtained. Results: Most of the tracheobronchial stenoses were caused by primary lung cancer (18/22).

G\u00fcnther; Aachen/D Purpose: Access to mediastinal masses through the lung may be complicated by uncontrolled pneumothorax and can lead to pulm onary bleeding. Controlled pneumothorax prior to biopsy allow s a safe access to mediastinal masses for large bore biopsies. Materials and Methods: In 6 patients with different mediastinal masses a protective pneumothorax w as established by infusion o f 100 ml C02 and 900 ml sterile air into the pleural space through a special designed atraumatic needle. After biopsy the intrapleural gas was removed. Results: The transpleural, extrapulm onal access was easily achieved. All his tologic specimen allowed detailed diagnoses. One patient showed mediastinal bleeding through the biopsy needle which was stopped by tissue glue. This adverse effects was not due to the described method. Conclusion: Controlled protective pneum othorax allows cutting needle biop sies of mediastinal masses where aspiration cytology yields no secure specific diagnosis and provides a save approach to mediastinal lesions. Material and Methods: One hundred thirty eight CT-guided transthoracic coaxial needle biopsies of pulm onary lesions were perform ed consecutively within 30 months using aspirating (n = 118) or autom ated cutting devices (n = 20). Comparison was performed between extem poraneous, histological and combined cytological and histological results. Factors (lesion size, distance from pleura, type of needle, histological type) influencing perform ances and pneumothoraces (21%) were determ ined as single and multiple dependent variables. Results: Combined cytological and histological analysis increase perform ance (sensitivity = 85%, specificity = 100%, PPV = 100%, NPV = 62% ) compare to histology alone (75%, 100%, 100%, 50% ) and extem poraneous analysis (80%, 93% . 98%, 56%). Performances were significantly influenced by lesion size (p = 0.0003) and histological type of tum or (carcinom a versus lymphoma) (p < 0.0001) as independent variables. Multivariate analysis showed that pneumothoraces were only favored by lesion distant from the pleura. Conclusion: Combined cytology and histology significantly increases perfor mances of CT guided tranthoracic coaxial needle biopsies. Distance from the pleura is the main risk factor fo r pneumothorax. Methods: Ten patients were presenting with clinical sym ptom s 0 -7 2 hours before the investigation, and studied using a 1.5 T scanner (Siemens Vision). The diffusion weighted sequence was a steady state free precession sequence (SSFP), TR/TE = 2 2 /2 -5 ms, pixel size 1.1 x 1.1 mm, 10 averages. The bvalue as a measure for the diffusion w eighting varied from 165-59 5 sec/mm2. Conventional T1 -and T2-weighted SE-sequences were also obtained. Results: 7/10 patients with clinically confirmed TG A showed elevation of signal intensity in the medial hypocampal region unilateral, including 3/10 showed bilateral signal abnorm ality in the diffusion weighted PSFI sequence. 3/10 patients had no observable change in diffusion PSIF. All conventional T1-and T2-weighted imaging was normal in signal intensity. In patients with acute ischemic stroke the aim o f radiologists should be to identify this penumbra o r the brain area which is still accessible for acute intervention. This study was designed to evaluate which imaging modal ity, CCT, conventional MRI, e.g. T2-and proton density weighted imaging, diffusion or perfusion imaging is best suited to detect the whole extent of cerebral ischemia earliest, so that ad\u00e9quat therapeutic management could be performed within a promising time window. Material and Methods: In 10 male W istar rats ischemic infarction was in duced by endovascular occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. All animals were examined in a 1.0 T whole body MR im ager (Picker, Cleveland, USA). MR and CT-Examination started within 60 minutes after vessel occlusion and were repeated every hour. A diffusion-weighted FSE-sequence was obtained to delineate size and site of the ischemic lesion. Then routine brain imaging with proton density-and T1-weighted spin-echo sequences was performed. In a representative slice at the level of the optic chiam a perfusion-weighted MRI was performed: 60 images were acquired before, during and after admin istration of the Gd-DTPA bolus injection. Immediately after the MR-protocol the anim als were examined with the CT. After the last examination, 6 hours after vessel occlusion the anim als were killed and the ischemic volum e was determ ined using a Histological staining (TTC-staining). Results: Both diffusion and perfusion weighted imaging detect the ischemic area within the first hour. T2-weighted images showed a hyperintensity ear liest after 3 hours, w hereas in T 1 -weighted images hypointensities could be detected first after 4 to 5 hours. In the C T hypodensity within the ischemic hemisphere could be seen first after 3 hours. Conclusion: O ur results show that diffusion-and perfusion weighted imaging are well suited to identify the ischemic area within 1 hour after vessel occlusion. The first changes in T2-weighted images and CT occurred both after 3 hours. Diffusion weighted imaging, however, could detect the early \"cytotoxic\" edema, which occurs within minutes after the onset of ischemia and perfusion weighted images could show the perfusion deficit immediately after vessel occlusion.",

From these curves rrCBV, MTT, and rrCBF were calculated. Then ,4C iodoantipyrine/100 g body w eight w as injected intravenously to measure CBF quantitatively. A utoradiographic and MR data were com pared in identical coronal sections of the same animals. Results: RrCBF in the ischemic hemisphere was decreased to 85% of the non-ischemic hemispheric value after 30 min occlusion tim e and decreased to 41% after 180 min occlusion time. Residual blood flow in the ischemic hemisphere w as 30% less with autroradiography than the rrCBF measured with MR fo r short occlusion times (< 60 min). For occlusion times o f more than 120 min no significant differences between both methods occurred.",

W e were particularly interested in image quality, contrast and susceptibility weighting of the sequences. Material and Methods: In 5 rats cerebral ischemia was induced by endovas cular MCA occlusion. MR experiments were performed on a 4.7 T Bruker Biospec 47/20. For perfusion-weighted imaging we used GRE-EPI, SE-EPI, and STE-EPI acquiring 16 four-slice datasets before and after injection of a Gd-DTPA bolus (A t = 1.4 s). Signal-to-noise-ratio (S/N) and signal-attenuationto-noise-ratio (A S/N ) were computed. Results: GRE-EPI images suffered from distortions due to susceptibility artifacts. Artifacts were widely reduced on the SE-EPI and STE-EPI series thus allowing to depict the ischemic area easily. FID-\u0395\u03a1\u0399 sequence exhibited the best S/N and A S/N. Although with the SE-EPI sequence the smallest signal decrease was achieved, AS/N of SE-EPI w as higher than that of STE-EPI due to the better S/N of SE-EPI. Conclusion: Our results suggest that SE-EPI is best suited fo r perfusionweighted imaging, because it allows to calculate reliable maps of the cere brovascular parameters due to minimal distortion artifacts and high S/N. GRE-EPI should only be used for perfusion measurements of homogeneous structures without abrupt changes in susceptibility. ",

Depending on these changes and continous followup cranial CT was performed. Detection o f fractures was possible in nearly all cases, while in three cases a depressed fracture was visualized without having been seen in convetional skull film. Conclusion: After head trauma reliable ultrasound examination of the in tracranial cavity is possible up to an age of 18 months. It allows to distinguish fresh and old injuries and helps to select the cases where C T is needed. In this age we consider ultrasound to be even more im portant than convetional skull film when there is no suspicio o f skull base fractures. Methods and Materials: 24 children at an age of 0 -1 4 were observed. Skull view, tangential screening, ultrasound, C T and three dimensional CT were performed solitaryly or in com bination. Results: Skull film and tangential view revealed the impression fracture in all cases. Celluloid ball fractures were observed only in infants. In two cases transkalottal ultrasound detected a small subdural bleeding with no signs of neurological deficit. In five cases tangential X-ray examination showed a frag ment deviation of more than double thickness o f the skull. In tw o of these children CT revealed dural laceration with one being neurologically inconspiciuous. All children with a fragm ent deviation o f less than double thickness of the skull were neurologically inconspiciuous and CT showed no dural or parenchymatous laceration. In six cases we performed three-dimensional CT which was of great value in the preoperative planning particularly in cases with extensive fractures. Conclusion: Conventional skull film is the basic examination completed by tangential X-ray view which allows to estimate the necessity for CT examination in children with neurological deficit and fo r surgical elevation depending on the fragment deviation. C T should be performed in children with neurological deficit and/or a fragment deviation of more than double thickness of the cranial vault. In extensive fractures three dimensional C T is of great value in the preoperative planning. In infants ultrasound is a valuable method for detection and follow-up o f intracranial bleedings. with Wilson disease and 2 with idiopathic copper toxicosis (Wilson like) were studied.

Szolar; Graz/A Purpose: Helical CT scanners now allow sequential corticomedullary phase (CMP) and nephrographic phase (NP) scans of the entire kidney to be obtained within a single breath-hold and during a single bolus injection of contrast material. The purpose of this study was to assess the potential o f thin-section helical CT imaging performed during the CMP and NP of contrast enhancement to classify solid renal masses and to correlate helical CT features obtained at CMP and NP images with pathologic findings. Materials and Methods: High-resolution helical CT o f the kidney (5-mm colli mation, 7.5-mm table feed, 4 mm-increments, 120 kVp, 292 mA) was perfomed in 52 patients (56 lesions) with solid renal m asses before and after IV bolus power injection o f 120 mL nonionic contrast material (2.5 mL/sec). Image data on size, attenuation, pattern o f contrast enhancem ent, presence and type of calcification, and cyst wall were analyzed on unenhanced and both CMP and NP scans. Differences in lesion-kidney densities and attenuation values o f re nal vein and inferior vena cava were measured. Three radiologists also used a 5-point score system to determ ine lesion visibility subjectively. Histopathology was obtained in all cases. Results: Of 56 renal masses, 45 (80% ) w ere malignant, and eleven (20%) were benign. Thirty-tw o masses (57% ) were smaller than 3.0 cm while 24 (43%) measured 3.0 cm or more in maximum diameter. Mean differences in enhancement between renal cortex and masses were 98 \u00b1 33 HU during the CMP and 84 \u00b1 21 HU during the NP while differences between renal medulla and masses increased from 50 \u00b1 28 HU on CMP scans to 111 \u00b1 30 HU on NP scans (p < 0.001). The conspicuity score averaged 2.9 \u00b1 0.3 for masses in the CMP vs 3.5 \u00b1 0.2 for masses in the NP (p < 0.001). Heterogeneous enhancement of masses correlated well with the presence of acellular regions (r = 0.03). Renal vein enhancement w as significantly greater during the CMP (153 \u00b1 40 HU) than during the NP (101 \u00b1 25 HU) (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Multiphasic thin-section helical C T improves characterization of solid renal masses. The CMP scans allow a more accurate assessment of re nal vein involvement in renal malignancies, while NP scans are advantageous in detection and classification of small solid masses. The NP should be utilized when only monophasic scanning is used to classify solid renal masses.",

Results: Peroperatively peritoneal carcinomatosis was found in 13 patients; only in 2 cases CT suggested peritoneal metastases. However, in 10/13 women CT-P indicated peritoneal spread. The 3 missed cases of carcinomato sis showed mainly flat lesions. Overall sensitivity was 15% fo r CT and 77% for CT-P. Overall specificity fo r CT was 92%, but decreased to 61% fo r CT-P. Material and Methods: Two liposomal, iodine-loaded contrast agents (BR2 and BR21, 280 and 310 mg iodine per ml, respectively) and a conventional extracellular contrast agent (iomeprol, 300 mg iodine per ml) were injected at 5 different doses (0 .5-2 .5 ml/kg body weight) as a bolus in a total of 60 healthy, male rabbits (3 -5 anim als per dose and substance). Following the injection, repeated CT exam inations were performed over a tw o-hour period (44 scans). Images were evaluated quantitatively. Results: Peak enhancement of the liver immediately after injection of BR2 or BR21 was significantly higher than that after iom eprol (p < 0.05), and reached up to +100 HU (2.5 ml/kg BR21). The effect was dose-dependent. C om pared with extracellular iomeprol, the time range of sufficient liver enhancem ent (> +50 HU) was prolonged substantially by the liposomal agents, demonstrating a plateau-like enhancement for at least tw o hours. Conclusion: BR2 and BR21 are promising liposomal contrast materials for CT providing an increased and prolonged liver enhancement.",

We examined 41 patients with abdom inal traum a using noncontrast dynamic CT. In 17 patients a con trast dynam ic CT was also performed. Diagnosis was confirmed surgically in 21 patients. On CT, 25 patients had hemoperitoneum ; 13 patients had splenic, 12 hepatic, 6 pancreatic, 8 bowel and mesenteric, 12 renal, 2 vascular injuries; 7 had retroperitoneal and 2 adrenal hematomas. All but 5 lesions (3 renal, 1 pan creatic and 1 splenic), were hypodense when the C .T was performed earlier than 8 hours of the injury. Postcontrast studies (n = 17), revealed 4 splenic, 3 hepatic, 1 pancreatic, 3 renal, 1 adrenal and 2 bowel and mesenteric injuries that were not shown on noncontrast CT.

Results: A reticular pattern was the most common single abnorm ality (n = 17), was sited anteriorly in 13/17 cases (76%), and w as more extensive in the middle lobe and lingula than in either upper or low er lobes (p < 0.005, p < 0.007 respectively). A reticular pattern was positively related to the ratio o f residual volume to total lung capacity (RV/TLC) (p = 0.001) but negatively correlated with gas transfer (p = 0.05) and forced vital capacity (p = 0.03).

Methods and Materials: Two acutely distressed patients with history of previ ous severe asthm a attacks were admitted. No blunt o r penetrating traum a was present in both cases. Clinical conditions and radiographic findings suggested preliminary C T evaluation that revealed extensive presence of extra-alveolar gas a t interstitial, subcutaneous and mediastinal levels (barotrauma) with unsuspected rachls involvement. Results: Barotrauma is a potentially lethal com plication of mechanical venti lation w hereas severe asthm a is considered in this setting only a predisposing condition. Occurrence of barotrauma in the absence of mechanical ventilation is very rarely seen and reported as well as that of pneumorachis, always related of basilar skull fracture and spinal instrumentation. Pneumorachis fol lowing asthma-induced barotraum a represents a never previously reported com plication of asthma, whose occurrence is probably related to subtle air mi gration via thoracic nerve root sleeves and/or disruption of pleural/meningeal planes. Conclusion: High degree of suspicion must be paid in the management of asthm atic patients in the presence o f acute respiratory distress. As reported here, asthma-induced barotrauma and related com plications (pneumorachis) m ust be suspected and thus promptly diagnosed by means of CT evalua tion, even in the absence of mechanical ventilation and/or traumatic chest injury.",

A persistent pneum othorax was found in 12 cases of malpositioned tubes. Conclusion: Malpositioning of thoracostom y tubes occurs with a high fre quency when tubes are placed under emergency room conditions. Single plain chest radiographs frequently do not detect malpositioned tubes. CT is superior to plain film chest radiography in the evaluation o f thoracostomy tube placement.

Conclusion: Preanaesthetic 3D SC T of the tracheobronchial tree should be used to select adequate DLTs, and to reduce com plications and intraoperative management problem s in one-lung-ventilation. Progress with regard to non-invasive imaging of the cardiovascular system has not been limited to a single modality. Instead we have seen the introduction of ultrasound contrast media vastly expanding the clinical utility of duplex sonog raphy, as well as the availability of progressively faster spiral CT scanners allowing depiction of w ider vascular territories in greater detail. Finally we have witnessed the emergence of ultrafast, contrast-enhanced 3D MR angiographic techniques, which permit the depiction of an entire vascular territory within a convenient breathhold lasting less than 30 sec. Following a brief discussion of the theoretical concepts, upon which the three non-invasive cardiovascular imaging modalities are based, this presentation will launch into a detailed, comparative discussion focussing on three vascular territories: the thoracic aorta, the abdominal aorta and its branches with particular em phasis on the renal arteries, and finally the pelvic arteries. Advantages and disadvantages of each of the relevant non-invasive imaging modalities will be illustrated based on various vascular pathologies. In addition, different image postprocessing techniques will be illustrated.

Adenocarcinom a appears to be the most common neoplasm of the small intestine. It is a solitary lesion mostly located proximally. Radiological appearances reflect the pattern of growth and include annular constricting lesions, filling defects, polypoid or ulcer ated masses, o r a com bination of these. Primary small intestinal lymphoma will present with a w ide spectrum of features, including multiple intraluminal polypoid filling defects, broadbased ulceration, aneurysm al dilatation, luminal narrowing with mucosal destruction, a large excavated mass and fistula for mation. A combination of different signs is seen in 10 -4 0 % o f cases. The radiological features of a carcinoid tum or m irror the stage that the pathological process has reached a t presentation. These include solitary or multiple in tram ural o r intraluminal filling defects, thickening of the valvulae conniventes, sharp angulation o r kinking, a stellate arrangem ent of intestinal loops or a secondary mesenteric mass, associated with radiating linear soft tissue strands. Benign small intestinal neoplasm s will usually appear as solitary or multi ple, sharply dem arkated, sessile o r pedunculated, intraluminal filling defects. Leiomyomas and neurofibrom as may also appear with an extraluminal or dumb-bel type of growth. The ability to accurately image these neoplasms represents a m ajor improvem ent in their diagnosis and management. There are numerous indications fo r central venous catheter insertions and these have increased considerably over the last decade. W hereas previously the majority of the long-term devices were inserted by surgeons, there has been a tendency in many centres fo r the procedure to be performed radiologically. There are several reasons fo r this including shorter procedure times and lower complication rates. In addition, especially in those patients who have undergone previous central venous catheter insertion, patency of the peripheral and central veins can be easily confirmed by ultrasound or contrast venography prior to attempted catheterization. In those individuals in whom the more usual venous accesses are occluded, other techniques (for example a translumbar puncture o f the inferior vena cava) may be performed under radiological guidance.",

Because o f the encouraging results endovascular stents are increasingly used even before radiation-or chemo-therapy are started to rapidly improve the patient's symptoms.

Brachiocephalic vein stenosis is also found in up to 20% of patients with hemodialysis access fistulas. Obstructions of the large femoral veins and the pelvic veins are usually secondary to deep vein thrombosis o r surgery and trauma. The May-Thurner-syndrome is a further cause fo r pelvic vein stenosis, usually on the left and preferably involving the fem ale sex. All these entities are excellent indications fo r stent treatment. Results and conclusions: Initial success after stent treatm ent fo r benign obstruction of the V. cava, brachiocephalic and pelvic veins can be expected in 80-100% . Long time patency rate has been excellent in our own experience, particularly for pelvic vein obstruction (100%, mean follow up 34 months). Also in the literature, though few longtime follow-up reports are available, high longtime patency rates in the V. cava and the iliofemoral veins are reported. Patients treated fo r brachiocephalic vein stenosis in hemodialysis fistulas show very good initial results, however recurrent stenosis has to be expected in 6 0 -8 0 % o f the cases. These patients have to be closely followed since retreatment with simple balloon dilatation gives very satisfactory results. Both spiral and high resolution (HR) C T techniques can be used in com bination fo r good assessment of large and small airway diseases. Spiral scanning with thin collimation is able to improve the detection, evaluation of extent, and char acterization of bronchial stenosis. It may orientate the endoscopist and serve as a guide for the taking o f a biopsy specimen. Its role in evaluating congen ital abnorm alities of the airways, and bronchopleural and bronchoesophagial fistula will be illustrated. Although HRCT is the widely accepted technique fo r diagnosing bronchiecta sis, spiral scanning can improve the diagnostic accuracy of CT in assessing the presence and extent of bronchiectasis. This is particularly appreciated in patients considered fo r surgery o r in case of interpretation difficulties on HRCT scans. HRCT remains the imaging modality of choice for evaluating small airway disease. Interpreted in the appropriate clinical context, the CT findings can be helpful in suggesting the presence of bronchiolitis. Expiratory air trapping is probably the most sensitive finding. Small centrilobular opacities reflect bronchiolar and peribronchial inflammatory changes that are potentially reversible. Mosaic perfusion is a finding of constrictive bronchiolitis due to bronchiolar or peribronchiolar irreversible fibrosis.",

Autom atic objective procedures which are truly quantitative and are applicable to HR C T have been made recently available but macroscopic as well as microscopic com parisons were needed to validate these techniques. The course will review how we have established that the relative area of lung occupied on HRCT scans by attenuation values low er than -950 HU is a valid measurement of macroscopic as well as microscopic em physem a. Com parisons between CT quantification, pulm onary function tests, macroscopic and microscopic measurements will be discussed. These com parisons will show how CT quantification can be integrated with pulm onary function studies and what is their values. In addition, it will be shown w hy expiratory CT is not as accurate as inspiratory CT fo r quantifying pulm onary em physem a and probably reflects air trapping more than reduction in the alveolar wall surface. Finally, the possible roles of age and hyperinflation will be presented. M odern imaging techniques have influenced and are still influencing the way brain tum ors are treated. Although tum or detection and differentiation from other lesions remains important, imaging data are increasingly used for surgical and radiation therapy planning, even intraoperative navigation. G eneral phenom enology: W hen single features are considered, brain tumors m ay be indistinguishable from other, non-neoplastic brain lesions. If multiple features are considered, however, this differentiation is com monly possible. Intrinsic tum or features com monly reflected by changes on CT or MRI in clude cellularity and other cell specifics, regressive changes (necrosis, fatty degeneration) and intratumoral hemorrhage. Peritum oral changes induced by the neoplasm include vasogenic edema and microinvasion, breakdown of the blood-brain-barrier, space-occupying effects and abnorm alities of bone. Radiologic classification: In principle, brain tum ors may be differentiated according to their location relative to the brain surface. In that case, intraaxial (true cerebral) neoplasm s are distinguished from extraaxial (extracerebral) neoplasms. True brain tum ors (m ostly gliomas) tend to have a w orser outcome than extracerebral tum ors (mostly m eningiomas and neurinomas). If tumors are differentiated by intracranial com partment, we distinguish supratentorial tum ors from intratentorial ones. Frequently, tum ors of the sella region and base of skull are separated from tum ors located closer to the skull vault. Radiologic diagnosis and pathology: Today, the most important imaging m odalities used in tum or diagnosis and follow -up are CT and MRI. MRI is particularly desirable because o f its high contrast resolution and multiplanar capability. Also, much of the vascular information needed for differential diagnosis or surgical planning is provided by conventional MRI plus MRangiography. MR-spectroscopy (particularly as 1 H-spectroscopy) is gaining in significance, as it provides metabolic data that help to differentiate or grade tum ors; the sam e is true fo r positron emission tom ography (PET). Ultrasound plays a role only in newborns/infants and during surgery. Conventional cerebral angiography m ay still be useful to determ ine the tum or type or the degree of vascularity. Angiographic techniques are also the basis of interventional procedures, such as preoperative devascularisation of highly vascular tumors (e.g. certain meningeomas, juvenile angiofibromas, and chemodectomas). If suitable imaging data are combined and analyzed, tum or type and tum or grade can be predicted fairly reliably. N euronavigation: In large centers such as ours, neuroimaging data are increasingly used fo r stereotaxy and intraoperative navigation. Brain tum or surgery may even be done inside an MR-unit o f the open design. Intraand immediate postoperative neuroim aging (while skull and dura are still open) may show tum or rests that need to be resected. Surgery can thus be made more radical and at the sam e time more safe. W ith respect to safety, functional MRI is also likely to aid significantly. Exactly knowing the location of functionally im portant brain structures relative to the tum or improves surgical planning immensely. Sequelae of treatm ent and tum or recurrence: In gliomas, specifically glioblas tom as, the am ount of residual tum or greatly affects outcome. W ith the avail ability of m orphologic imaging, the sequelae of surgery can be described in detail, including com plications such as hemorrhage and infarction. Differen tiation o f tum or necrosis from recurrent tum or requires functional imaging, though. M ost commonly, PET is used in this situation, but dynamic-functional form s of MRI, such as perfusion and diffusion techniques, may be able to provide the same information in the near future. The last decade MR imaging has been introduced as a new diagnostic tool in the pelvis. Computed tom ography is valuable, but many reports have shown the superiority o f MR imaging. Furthermore, this technique is undergoing rapid improvement due to technical developm ents. In this course the role of MR imaging fo r the m anagem ent o f carcinom a o f the urinary bladder and benign diseases of the fem ale pelvis is reviewed and illustrated. Important factors fo r optimal MR imaging will be shown. N ew developm ents such as threedimensional, dynamic, and fast-spin echo sequences and the use of contrast agents, o f endorectal and phased array coil imaging are discussed. Finally, the clinical value of MR imaging in staging bladder carcinom a and in showing benign conditions in the fem ale pelvis such as congenital abnormalities, adenomyosis, leiomyomas, and obstetrics is assessed, and com pared with sonography, and CT. Learning objectives: After attending this course, participants will be able to optimize MR images of the urinary bladder and the fem ale pelvis, by selecting the appropriate pulse sequences and surface coils, and using MR contrast agents in the right way. They will be able to identify bladder carcinoma and benign female pelvic pathology on MR images and know the clinical relevance of this technique.

Preoperative knowledge of deep myom\u00e9trial invasion of an endometrial carcinom a will alert surgeons to the necessity of lymph node dissection, rather than sampling, and invasion of cervical stroma by cervical carcinoma will require a radical rather than sim ple hysterectomy. Imaging is im portant in staging the disease, w ith em phasis on myom\u00e9trial and cervical stromal invasion and lymph node status. MR imaging has proved superior to both CT and ultrasound in the identification of tum or size, location, depth of stromal invasion, parametrial invasion, and loco-regional extent. MR imaging is the method of choice fo r planning radiotherapy and provides the best information for differentiating postoperative scar from recurrent tumor. C T and MR imaging proved to be versatile imaging modalities for charac terization of prim ary ovarian neoplasms. W ith both modalities, tum or size, wall thickness, presence of vegetations and solid structures are criteria for lesion characterization. However, C T remains the primary imaging modality for presurgical staging o f the whole abdomen and pelvis. Learning objective: To get acquainted with the normal appearance of the fem ale pelvis on MR images and to understand the potential impact of imaging on patient management in cases of endometrial, cervical and ovarian cancer. A city-wide PACS system allows sharing of medical images between the hospitals, the cancer clinic and medical research units. The images from the CT and MRI scanners are \"pushed\" to a central archive upon completion of the study. Selected ultrasound and all nuclear medicine studies are also scheduled to be archived in the same way. A password protected web brow ser with image enhancement capabilities allows physicians to review studies via Internet connections on cheaper, lower resolution, monitors than those available in the Medical Imaging Departments.",

In this course the main clinical applications of teleradiology will be presented, distinguishing between intra-institutional teleradiology (that involves more units belonging to the same departm ent or to the same hospital) and inter-institutional tel eradiology (more classically aimed at primary interpretation and subspecialty consultation). W hether it takes place at an intra-institutional level or at a wider level involving several hospitals and imaging centers, teleradiology is now being successfully used to solve actual clinical problems. The aim can be the fast and effective com munication o f the examination results to the referring physician o r the access to subspecialty consultation or image databases for increasing the confidence o f radiological diagnoses. At any rate, teleradiology has now moved from the preliminary stage of feasibility studies and research projects to attain the status o f an established clinical practice.

Our analysis is based on a study in 100 consecutive cases. Material and Methods: evaluation and assessm ent of the follow ing param e ters before and within a 30-day post TIPSS period: portosystem ic gradient; morphologic delineation o f the portal circulation; invasive scintigraphic deter mination of the portal perfusion fraction (PPF) and the total liver perfusion (GLP); transcatheter intraarterial flow change measurement; serum levels of albumin and bilirubin; assessment of hepatic encephalopathy by appropriate testing; assessment o f recurrent variceal bleeding. Analysis o f the long-term results is made on the total cohort group of more than 300 patients. Results: by TIPSS variceal feeding w as widely reduced; as assessed mor phologically and Theologically portal liver perfusion w as significantly lowered. However, there was immediate onset o f com pensated liver perfusion by in creased arterial inflow. Total liver perfusion was not significantly altered. In TIPSS portal decompression was readily achieved with reduction o f the por tosystem ic gradient from an average o f 24 mm Hg to 10.5 mm Hg. In our series we could not dem onstrate an increased incidence of hepatic encephalopa thy during the 30-day post TIPSS period. Bilirubin levels were significantly increased after TIPSS from 2.45 to 2.61 mg/dl (p = 0.0067), while albumin levels were not altered. Early mortality w as 4% and early re-bleeding rate 3%, respectively. The 30-month occlusion rate w as 2%. How ever during the first 2 years a well organized shunt surveillance program w as m andatory including sonographic and portographic controls. In Child's A patients a 95% 1 -year re-intervention rate was recorded. In Child's \u0421 this w as only 45%. Technical success has generally been > 95%. Many procedural com plications have been described with an overall rate of about 10% and most of them can be m anaged with standard endovascular techniques. The 2 most com monly encountered secondary com plications are encephalopa thy and delayed occlusion o f the stent. Encephalopathy occurs in 10 -2 0 % of cases and is usually easily controlled by medical treatm ent. Persistant en cephalopathy can however be treated either by an em bolization of the shunt, or rather by a TIPS-reducer. Secondary stent obstructions is reported to oc cur between 17-50% , with an average incidence of shunt com prom ise at 6 months of 25 -3 5 % . During the first month, occlusions are always caused by a throm bosis occurring in 9 to 13% of cases and due to a technical defect (prosthesis shortening, insufficient shunt caliber, m ajor angulation...). A fter the first month, occlusions are usually due to an excessive intimai hyperplasia the mechanism of which is still incom pletely cleared up. W hatever their cause, these occlusions can be treated percutaneously in different ways. Practical information on these techniques and indications will be detailed. The best technical aspects of performing TIPS procedures will be dem on strated in detail, with a com bination o f brief slide and video content.

Analyses of this type demand anatomical image quality criteria for determ ination of the dose necessary for optimal diagnostic image quality. Our experiences with the elaboration of such criteria and testing their value as part o f quality assurance will be discussed.

Frequently, lung metastases originate from cancers of the head and neck, breast, stomach, pancreas, kidney, bladder, the male and fem ale genitouri nary tract, and sarcomas. Pulmonary m etastases may appears as pulmonary nodules, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, endobronchial tum ors, and pleural in volvement. Plain chest radiography is typically the modality used fo r detection and posttherapeutic monitoring of lung metastases; however, the use of CT fo r these purposes is becoming more frequent. Currently, spiral CT appears to be the m ost sensitive imaging technique in the identification of metastases because it detects a higher num ber of pulm onary nodules com pared to other techniques. The role of the radiologist involves the identification o f metastatic disease, determ ination o f the differential diagnosis, monitoring the response to therapy, and the use of invasive procedures w hen the differential diagno sis indicates the need for biopsy and histopathologic proof. The radiologist m ust be aware of the im pact of the diagnosis on patient management and should be fam iliar with oncologic strategies, as well as the term inology used to characterize tum or response.

Screening fo r metastases in patients with local symptoms o r pain is best accomplished by a com bination o f radiography and MRI. MRI is helpful in differentating between malignant, benign and nonneoplastic lesions. Due to overlap in MRI-characteristics, bone biopsy som etimes is essential for correct diagnosis. Bone biopsy and aspiration cytology has proven highly accurate in diagnosing bone lesions. The procedure involves low risk to the patient.

Uncommon causes are venous infarction, eclampsia, and infectious conditions such as endocarditis with septic emboli, vasculitis and encephalitis. Radiology has an im portant role to play in the diagnosis of non-accidental injury. The role o f the radiologist in relation to the musculoskeletal abnorm alities is the detection of skeletal injury, be it overt o r occult, dating o f this injury in an effort to assist the investigation, and a judgem ent to be made by the radiologist as to w hether the injury is compatible with the clinical history provided. It is im portant that radiologists are fam iliar with the bony lesions of non accidental injury, so that these are not overlooked, and lead to failure to protect the child. The skeletal injuries of non-accidental injury will be explored from these viewpoints and discussion will take place regarding the timing and the types of radiographs that are required and when further imaging is indicated. In addition, the limitations o f the radiological input will be discussed.

A w are ness of the unexpected appearance of these changes frequently permits differ entiating them from superimposed infection, recurrent malignancy, radiationinduced tumors, and the changes that go beyond the expected norm, the true complications of radiation therapy. Radiation therapy changes are a function of the volume of tissue treated, the shape of the field, the total dose and how it was delivered, the duration of time from com pletion of therapy and the effect of other therapies. It must be appreciated that the tim ing of changes varies in the different organs. Acute radiation pneumonitis is generally seen approxim ately 2 months after completion of radiotherapy. Radiation pericarditis is generally not seen until 6 to 9 months after therapy. Radiation-induced sarcomas do not develop on average until 10 to 15 years after radiation therapy. An overview of expected findings in the lungs, heart, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, and bones will be presented and features that distinguish these from recurrence and radiation-induced com plications discussed.

Malignant tum ors showed a significantly increased flow velocity compared to benign lesions (m ean Vmax and mean Rl = 57.3 cm /sec and 0.74 in G3; 23.6 cm/sec and 0.75 in G2; 16.7 cm/sec and 0.7 in G3; and 11.3 cm/sec and 0.65 in benign lesions). CD did not detect blood flow in 47 tum ors -35 benign ones and 12 m alignant ones (6 G1, 4 G2, 3 carcinom a in situ). After UCA, demonstration of the num ber o f blood vessels, w as improved in 21 cases. The presence o f lymph node metastases showed a positive association (p < 0.01 ) with tum or flow velocities and tum or grades. Conclusion: CD and PD play com plem entary roles in the diagnostic as sessm ent o f breast cancer, their specificity is equal. Additional use of UCA increases the num ber of intratumoral vessels detected. The value of the UCA in the differentiation of malignant and benign tum ors will be discussed. Color pixel density (CPD) and mean color value (MCV) were measured before and after i.v. application of Levovist to evaluate the increase in signal intensity, the contrast transit tim e and potential additional information to differential diagnosis. Histologic proof w as obtained in all cases. Results: After contrast media administration cancers displayed a characteristic vascular pattern of neovascularisation. CPD and MCV were significantly higher in carcinomas than in benign conditions. C arcinom as showed a shorter time to maximum signal intensity and a longer duration of enhancem ent than benign lesions. Conclusion: Computer-assisted quantitative evaluation of breast tum ors after i.v. injection of Levovist may increase the diagnostic confidence and improve the sensitivity of US in the detection o f tum ors and its specificity in differenti ating benign lesions from carcinomas.",

Kaiser; Jena/D Purpose: It was the aim o f the study to evaluate the advantage of the contrast agent \" Levovist\" fo r color Doppler sonography in malignant and benign breast lesions. Material and Methods: 35 patients (23 carcinomas, 12 benign lesions) were examined before and after bolus injection o f the contrast agent \"Levovist'' (2.5 g/patient). All patients had a basic color Doppler examination under visual control in Doppler mode, power mode and simultaneous video recording (SVHS). Signals were analysed by a visual analog score from 1 (low) to 5 (high signals). The intensity of the Doppler signals, the changes in the vascular patterns, and the timing of the transit of the contrast agent bolus were measured. Correlations between lesions and both tum or size and histology of the tum or were performed. Results: \"Levovist\" increased the intensity of the Doppler signals significantly. Results in power mode are slightly better com pared to normal color Doppler S 116 mode. Transit time was not significantly different in malignant and benign masses (22.9 \u00b1 2.5 cs. 19.7 \u00b1 2.0 sec.). The cancers showed characteristic vascular morphologic features and a striking increase of vascular signals in the peritumoral area of 6 mm. A fter \"Levovist\" injection the color Doppler signal increased significantly in carcinomas from score 1.9 \u00b1 0.1 to score 3.4 \u00b1 0.3. In benign lesions this increase w as not significant (before \"Levovist\": score 1.5 + 0.4; after: score 1.9 + 0.3). The intensity, of US signals in the surrounding of both malignant and benign tum ors was relatively low and not different in malignant and benign masses. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that microbubble contrast agents for color Doppler US may enable an accurate differentiation of benign masses from carcinomas.",

Chemelli; Innsbruck/A Purpose: was to assess the value o f high-resolution sonography in intraductal or mainly intraductal breast lesions. Methods and Materials: 83 patients with nipple discharge or mammographie findings suspicious for intraductal abnorm alities were examined with galactog raphy and sonography, using a 10 Mhz transducer. Results: 29 papillomas, 4 papillomatoses, 9 DCIS and 2 invasive ductal carcinomas were confirmed by biopsy. Sonography was equivalent to galac tography in 62 cases. 5 DCIS were diagnosed with sonography alone; in another 12 cases, sonography was superior in showing the full extent of intraductal abnormality. 2 small papillomas were overlooked by sonography, and 2 findings were false positive. Conclusion: High-resolution sonography is considered a valuable additional modality for the assessment of intraductal breast pathology. This new procedure can be performed simultaneously with X-ray mammog raphy without decompression o f the breast. However, because o f different projections (mammography with divergent ray path and ultrasound with paral lel ray path), lesions are not com pletely matched in location. The present study was performed to exactly superimpose lesion projection at mammography and ultrasound. Materials and Methods: The examination unit com prises a mammograph combined with an automatically guided 5-MHz linear ultrasound transducer, a conventional ultrasound device and a w orkstation fo r processing o f the ultrasound images. Sonographically and radiographically visible labels on the bottom surface of the upper com pression plate and the top surface of the film cassette holder (coupling by a water-filled elastic container) served to establish a matrix fo r the com bined examination. The positions of these labels on mammograms and ultrasound images were used to com pute grids for mammograms and sonographic scout images, which allowed clear assignm ent of the lesion in relation to its position on mammograms. The feasibility o f this combined examination was tested in patient studies. Results: The above-described procedure makes it possible to match radiographic and sonographic findings. Conclusion: The efforts presented here aim at a direct digital superimposition of mammograms and sonographic summation im ages fo r more clearly identi fying pathologic alterations. Our results suggest that this aim can be achieved by appropriate correction of either of the tw o images. In 300 preoperative or prebiopsy patients mammography, autom ated CARI-ultrasound and conventional ultrasound and palpation were com pared with histologic results. CARI-US (Sens./Spec.: 88% /69% ) was better than pal pation (80%/74%), at least com parable to conventional-US (87% /65% ) and complementary to mammography (96%/37%). Conclusion: Excellent standardisation and easy evaluation make it interesting for w ider use and possibly as a supplem ent fo r palpation. Further experience is necessary. This project is supported by Dt. Krebshilfe. Results: The FPI does not discriminate between acute or chronic small bowel disease. Patients with functional disorders (e.g. constipation, irritabel bowel syndrom e) showed significant higher FPI-scores in the items \"strain\", \"physical com plaints\" , \"excitability\" and \"emotionality\" and low er scores in the items \"perform ance and efficiency\" and \"life contentm ent\" . Concerning intraluminal pressure and motility group A and group \u0412 differed partial significantly from group C. Patients with C rohn's disease showed a decreased motility and high intraluminal pressure, while motility in patients with functional disorders was raised. Conclusion: T he personality profile (FPI) of patients without radiomorpholigic abnorm alities of the small bowel correlates with changes in the small bowel motility (\"intestinal hurry\") and intraluminal pressure. Further investigation is necessary to elucidate the coherences between disease, functional impair ment, motility and intraluminal pressure. (14) and large bowel (11). G radient echo, T1-weighted, MR coronal and axial scans (8 mm slice) were obtained before and after Gd-DTPA i.v. administration using a breath-hold technique. Results: Sites of inflam matory involvement were identified at the MRI scans in 17/25 patients; negative findings were observed in eight patients with involvement of either the jejunum (3) o r the proximal ileum (5). In five out of the 17 patients with positive MR findings, wall thickening w as observed also in tracts where no abnorm alities of mucosal profile were evident at the barium studies. Seven patients had com plications such as fistulae (5) Two contiguous acquisitions in the coronal plane allowed coverage from the aortic bifurcation to the middle thigh (popliteal trifurcation), each lasting 30 to 34 seconds. Subsequently, DSA was performed in all patients. Results: Contrast-enhanced MRA resulted in superb enhancement of the pelvic and peripheral arteries (signal-to-noise ratio 10.9 \u00b1 3.1). MRA correctly depicted all significant stenoses (> 50% ) o r occlusions of iliac arteries. Angiographic correlation revealed an 100% sensitivity and 59.9% specificity for grading of stenosis (< 50% , 50 -6 9 % , 7 0 -99% ) o r occlusion of fem oral and politeal arteries, respectively. In 27 patients with bypass grafts, MRA agreed with the results o f DSA in 24 patients (89%). Conclusion: Bolus-enhanced MRA appears to be a very promising noninvasive screening method fo r fast evaluation of peripheral vascular occlusive disease. The reduction in imaging tim e may justify the additional costs of high-dose contrast material. Results: In all patients the arterial tree from the aortic bifurcation to the trifurcation could be visualized. 112 lesions were detected by MRA. Sensitivity was 96% , specificity was 92%. 62 lesions were classified as high grade or occlusion and reevaluated. In this category sensitivity was 100% and specificity was 96%.

Collimation was 2.5 and 5 mm/pitch 1/increment 1.5 and 2.5 mm /120 kv/200 mAs fo r whole lung examination during a single-breathhold scan with a Double-Detector-Helical-CT (Elscint Twin). Real-Time Virtual endoscopy was performed with standard software-tools (Silicon-Graphics-Explorer) and standard hardware (Silicon-Graphics-lndigo2-High Im pact). Views w ere com pared with corresponding fiberoptic views. Criteria were detection of tum ors, stenosis, occlusion, impression by extraluminal masses and artifacts. All results were com pared to surgical findings. Results: Virtual endoscopy showed all tumors, stenosis and occlusions of main airways. C om pared to fiberoptic examinations it is less accurate accord ing to impressions (60%). In all cases it w as possible to pass the stenosis and examine peripheral airways. Artifacts -imitating stenosis -were caused by heart pulsation (30%), secretion (13%) and breathing (16%) which were only detectable in the axial scans. Combined views of multiplanar reconstructed images and virtual endoscopy were superior to detect extraluminal causes of impressions. Conclusion: Real-time Virtual endoscopy is a useful tool fo r preoperative, noninvasive exam ination of the airways but it is limited by spatial resolution (2 .5 -5 mm) and artifacts. Pulmonary nodules were divided into four groups according to their size: I) nodules < 5 mm, II) nodules 6 -1 0 mm, III) nodules 11 -20 mm, IV) nodules > 21 mm.

Materials and methods: Sixty-four consecutive patients with known o r sus pected diffuse lung disease underwent both H R C T (1-mm-collimation scans at 10-mm intervals from the lung apices to the bases) and spiral CT (1-mmcollimation, pitch 1, 6-sec scanning time). Three separate sets o f spiral CT scans were obtained at the level of the aortic arch, carina, and 2 cm above the diaphragm. Each set of spiral CT scans and the corresponding HRCT section were independently evaluated by 2 chest radiologists fo r the presence and extent o f bronchiectasis, honeycombing, ground-glass, nodular and linear opacities. Image quality was also assessed. Results: Parenchymal abnorm alities were present in 48 patients. HR C T and spiral CT provided similar information in patients with honeycom bing (n = 14), ground-glass attenuation (n = 6), and linear opacities (n = 12). Spiral CT proved to be superior in depicting bronchiectasis in 20/24 (83%) patients, and nodular opacities in 8/9 (88%) patients. Motion artifacts were more com monly seen on HRCT than on spiral CT scans (16 versus 10 patients). Slightly increased image noise w as observed on spiral C T scans in 4 cases. Conclusions: Limited thin-collimation spiral C T scans in addition to HRCT m ay be valuable in selected cases, especially in patients with bronchiectasis and subtle nodular patterns. Purpose: Variation o f the MR-signal in the brain related to cardiac and respiratoy activity were examined using a echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with a high tem poral resolution. Method: At a com mercial 1.5 T whole body system, an EPI-sequence with a measurement time of 107 ms fo r a 64*64 image matrix was developed, which allows the acquisition of 1024 images in 107 s. In addition the cardiac pulse and the respiration was monitored. M easurement w ere performed in an axial slice through the aqueduct. In order to increase signal from spins entering the slice from outside during the measurement, a pulse angle of 90\u00b0 was used. The signal of the time series was analyzed in selected brain regions. In addition, images were rearranged according to their tim e delay to the ecg-pulse. By this, signal change of the w hole image within one cardiac cycle could be evaluated in the cine mode. Results: No significant signal variations due to cardiac o r respiratory activity was found in normal brain tissue. In arteries and veins one signal maximum was found 100 ms and 700 ms after the peripheral measured pulse signal, respectivly. In the CSF within the aqueduct tw o signal maxima could be ob served, which indicated a bidirectional m ovem ent within one cardiac cycle. The first maximum of the aquaeduct signal disappeared during inspiration, dem on strating a unbalanced flow through the aqueduct in this respiratory phase. Conclusion: With EPI sequences the signal variations in the brain in ac cordance to the cardiac and respiratory activity can be studied without any triggering of measurements. In a acqusition time of only one m inute inform a tion for the analysis o f CSF pulsations can be obtained. This m easurement technique can be added to patients exam inations with only m inor tim e con sumption. To evaluate functional differences of these structures we have performed a study by com paring imaginary and real voluntary hand movements. Methods and Materials: fMRI data of the whole brain were acquired with a com mercial whole body 1.5 Tesla tom ograph (Siemens Vision\u00ae) using a multislice echo planar imaging sequence (EPI) with 27 axial slices (4 mm slice thickness, 1 mm gap, 128*96 matrix, 260*162 mm FOV, TE 66 ms, TR 1.8 ms ct 90\u00b0, acquisition tim e 4 sec).

Imagined movem ents were trained to avoid motoric output by EMG control and a personal assessm ent of scaling the intensity. Statistical evaluation of the fMRI data was done by calculation of z-values and a comparison of activated pixels within M1, PM, SMA and cerebellum. Results: Imagined movem ents show lower activation in M1 than the executed movements. In addition during imaginary movements the cerebellar activity was dim inished but revealed great individual differences. Conclusions: W hole brain fMRI is useful to assess functional activity of the whole central m otor system and it seems to be feasible to evaluate different steps during planning and execution of voluntary actions. The ipsilateral coactivation of the corresponding area w as < 2%. No significant differences between right-and left-handed subjects were found in the primary motor area. Musicians had a significantly larger area of activation in this region but no significant changes with a more com plex paradigm. The paradigm com plexity was related to changes in SMA and prem otor area. W ith foot movement, the primary m otor area was larger in ballet dancers com pared to normals.

Feuerbach1 ; 1 R egensburg/D, 2 Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg/D Purpose: To evaluate the applicability o f functional MRI (fMRI) to preoperative imaging in patients with brain tum ours in o r near the sensorim otor cortex. Methods and Materials: 16 patients with brain tum ours in or near the senso rimotor cortex were included in this study, 7 of them showed a hemiparesis. Preoperative MRI including fMRI was performed at 1.5 T. The task consisted of clenching and spreading of the hand contralateral to the tum our location. Quality of subtraction images (activation -rest), t-maps, and time course of signal intensity in activated regions were evaluated visually on a scale between 1 and 5. Statistical analysis included the M ann-W hitney test (p < 0.05). Results: In 7 patients the tum our was located outside, in 9 patients adjacent or within the sensorimotor cortex. Edema was present in 14 patients -outside or adjacent to the sensorim otor cortex (n = 7) o r within it (n = 7). At least 75% of the fMRI studies were graded as satisfactory (or better), none of them had to be rejected completely. Our preliminary results showed no statistically significant differences for: presence or absence o f hemiparesis: location of tum our or edema within or near the sensorimotor cortex. Conclusion: fMRI of the sensorim otor cortex can be integrated into preoper ative MRI in patients with brain tumours. Results: Excretory urography is first choice technique fo r an approach to these four clinical urologie situations: lithiasis, obstruction, hem aturia and recurrent infection and it is also essential in some other situations (uretheric iatro genic trauma, follow-up of bladder resected tum ors, invasion from colorectal carcinoma, etc).",

Patients were then followed-up and stone passage or removal, and the course of clinical symptoms were noted. The value of these modalities were statistically compared using the criteria of direct stone dem onstration as well as indirect supportive findings. Results: Forty-four patients were proved to have ureteral stones based on stone passage or removal. Seventeen patients were considered not to have ureteral stones based on failure to recover a stone, disappearance of symptoms, and diagnoses unrelated to stone disease. Spiral CT w as found to be the most useful method in the demonstration of ureteral stones with a sensitivity of 94%. Reformatted images clearly depicted the intraureteral location of stones in most cases. Spiral CT showed renal calculi in 18 patients, US in 5 and IVU in 7. Conclusions: Noncontrast axial and reformatted spiral C T images were found superior to US and IVU in the depiction of ureteral and renal calculi. Reformatted images can be a good alternative to IVU in problem atic cases. Tuesday T1-w eighted 3D-FFE-sequence up to 120 minutes after i.v.-injection of the gadolinium bloodpool prototype WIN 22181. Results: In the first 15 minutes following injection, the urographie effect was predom inantly poor. 105 minutes after application, excellent visualization of the entire collecting system w as evident in 4 pigs, while incomplete but satisfactory demonstration persisted in 3 anim als. A fter additional low dose Furosemide administration in one case, further distension of the urinary tract was rapidly achieved w hich increased image quality effectively. Signal measurements within the norm al renal parenchyma revealed a gradual decrease o f the initial distinct enhancement. Conclusion: In the animal experiment, contrast-enhanced MRU allows de tailed visualization of nonobstructed urinary tracts, while information about renal perfusion and excretory function are obtained simultaneously. However, application of a diuretic and ureteral com pression seem to be necessary to prevent unpractical examination duration that results from the prolonged physiological clearance o f the bloodpool agent. cium is usually straightforward.

Fiedler; Krefeld/D Purpose: Rapid inter-departmental communication and economical image archiving are imperative fo r today's hospital. For this reason, while modernizing our Radiology D epartment in the autumn of 1995, we installed a Picture Archiving and Comm unication System in our 1200 bed hospital. M ethods and Materials: W ith the SIENET-PACS, our Radiology has been fully digital fo r 18 m onths; all exam inations with the exception o f mammography are now reported from high-quality monitors and stored in digital archives. Results: Digital image networking technology provides us with better util isation of equipment, higher diagnostic quality and guarantees trouble-free image distribution to the clinical departments, which are located throughout our hospital campus. Furthermore, the Klinikum Krefeld provides radiological expertise to affiliated hospitals connected via public lines. Conclusion: On the basis of empirical data, we have determ ined that the im plem entation o f such system s has been medically beneficial and cost-effective, with far-reaching, positive consequences fo r physicians, radiographers, clerks and patients during routine use. The increasing utilization and image quality of US equipment along with growing patient loads require more efficient system s fo r documentation and archiving. W e report on ou r experiences of the first three months fol lowing the installation of a new com puter based system fo r the storage and m anagem ent of image data and reports on a num ber o f 900 patients. Materials and Methods: The documentation system used is ALIUItraPACS, which consists of a networked software package running on standard personal computers. Images are digitized from the US video output using a frame grabber and archived to W ORM discs. Image capture via DICOM-3 is also possible. Results: T he availability of images fo r demonstration or fo r reference during subsequent exam inations is significantly increased. Revision of patient reports is easy. The high image quality is useful fo r research and teaching. A WWW interface provides access to images and reports from office PCs. Data ex change with other PACS system s is possible. Approximately five weeks were required fo r the staff to adapt to the new system. Only large institutions can likely afford the high initial costs. Conclusion: Digital documentation system s fo r US offer advantages in the daily departm ental routine, e.g. reducing time required fo r patient management. . Recognition accuracy and duration of dictation as well as correction time were recorded and compared in each system. The recognition accuracy was achieved by counting correctly recognized words relatively to the total am ount of words. Results: Both system s started with a mean accuracy o f about 90%. Depending from adaptation process o f the system, reports were used to expand the representation of speech, syntax and vocabulary of the system. A fter a training period the recognition accuracy improved to 99%. Both systems require about 2.5-fold of the conventional dictation time. The IPDS requires even more time due to the stop-and-go-speech necessary for word-separation. Differences due to specific characteristics of both system s will be presented. Conclusion: Digital voice recognition will be a part of the daily routine work of a physician. It is handable after a hard tim e of system's training. Then recognition rates o f more than 99% as reached by conventional dictation m ethods can also be achieved digitally. The display o f digital plain film radiographs is becoming increasingly more popular, particularly with the advent of CR and PACS systems. This opens up the possibility o f com puterised teaching material/sessions and case conferencing systems. For medium to large teaching/conferencing sessions the display o f the images on a large screen projector is required. The aim of the project was to assess the suitability of a high quality large screen video projector for use with digitised plain film radiographs. Methods and Materials: Fifty plain film X-R ays of various pathologies were digitised at 2 \u041a x 2 \u041a resolution and 12 bits pixel depth. These were displayed on the large screen projector (Electrohom e 2 \u041a x 2 \u041a projector). A panel o f consultant radiologists were asked to report on the projected images. The adjustment o f w indow level and width on the displayed image was utilised as w ere other image processing functions such as edge enhancement, zooming, etc. A num ber of weeks later the original plain film s were reported.",

Purpose: To describe MR appearance, natural evolution and to make histo logic correlation in a large series of prim ary and recurrent desmoids. M aterials and Methods: In the European Study on MR Imaging of Soft Tissue Tum ors' (initiated at the ECR 1993) 28 desm oids were compiled. Both in primary (n = 18) and recurrent (n = 10) desmoids, several parameters (e.g. location, size, com partm ental distribution, shape, am ount and distribution of low signal intensity (SI) areas, margins, spread, bone involvement, S i's, homogeneity, enhancem ent degree and pattern) were scored on MR images. Two cases were followed with MR imaging over more than six years. Results: Desmoids are mostly located in the muscles of shoulder and hip gir dle, are often fusiform with partially ill defined margins and may be multicentric with variable am ounts o f non enhancing low SI areas. Rare subcutaneous desm oids have a more stellar appearance. Spontaneous evolution is charac terized by an increase of low SI areas. There is a non proportional relationship between cellularity and SI on T2-weighted images. No obvious difference is seen neither in cellularity nor in overall SI on T2-weighted images by comparing recurrent with primary desmoids. Conclusion: MR findings in a series of 28 desmoids, MR follow-up in 5 patients and similarity of primary and recurrent lesions as well on histology as on MR imaging aid in understanding the natural evolution of desmoids and raise the question whether secondary lesions are recurrences or asynchronous primary lesions. These concepts may change the therapeutic (surgical versus non surgical) strategy of desmoid tumors. The most evident clinical signs of aging at skeletal level include loss o f height and kyphosis, due to progressive w edging of vertebral bodies. On the other hand it is largely docum ented that BMD decreases with age. Aim: of this study is to investigate the correlation between BMD and the sum of vertebral body heights from T4 to L5 by morphometry. Methods: in 163 women (age range 3 9 -7 4 years), 76 premenopausal (age range 3 9 -5 4 years) and 87 postmenopausal (age range 4 6 -7 4 years) were taken lateral radiographs of the thoracic and lumbar spine and BMD of the lumbar spine by dual-energy X-rays absorptiom etry (DXA) using a QDR-2000 (Hologic, Inc, USA). Vertebral morphometry was performed by means a com puterized image analysis system (NIM, Verona, Italy) which allows to digitalize the images and to calculate the vertebral heights, their ratios and the sum of the vertebral bodies heights (T4-L5) namely the anterior, middle and posterior spine deform ity indexes (AHs, MHs and PHs). Results: AHs, MHs and PHs significantly correlate with BMD; the correlation is stronger between BMD vs AHs (r = 0.8, p < 0.0001) respect BMD vs S 1 3 6",

This approach enables a reader-independent high specificity, which has been a m ajor limitation in MRM. To explore the association between dynamic MR characteristics and histopathological prognostic factors of invasive breast cancer. Methods and Materials: 53 women with prim ary invasive breast cancer un derw ent dynam ic contrast-enhanced breast MR imaging. Region-of-interest (ROI) analysis w as performed on synthetic images obtained by kinetic mod elling of the dynam ic data. For each tumour, operator-defined, large ROIs and com puter-defined, 9-pixel ROIs were selected. The relative increase in mean ROI pixel intensity was expressed in the form of enhancement ra tios. Univariate and m ultivariate analyses were performed to explore the association of these ratios with standard histologic factors, including tumour size, histopathological classification, histologic grade, presence of extensive in situ com ponent and lymphovascular invasion, multifocal disease, and axillary lymph node status. Results: All enhancement ratios showed significant differences between node positive and node-negative tum ours (P < 0.002). However, autom ated ROI ratios showed less overlap between node-positive and node-negative carcino mas than large ROI ratios did. A strongly significant association was observed between all autom ated ROI enhancement ratios and histologic grade (P < 0.001). Based on stepwise multiple regression analysis, node status and histologic grade were the only histopathological factors with a significant independent effect on the enhancement characteristics. Conclusion: There is a strong association between dynam ic MR characteris tics and two im portant prognostic markers of invasive breast cancer, namely, axillary node status and histologic grade.

To assess the value of delayed gadolinium -enhanced MR imaging in differentiation between breast carcinoma and fibroadenom a. M aterialand Methods: At 1.5 T, 55 women with 83 breast lesions (55 breast carcinomas and 28 fibroadenom as) were prospectively examined by dynamic gadolinium -enhanced MR imaging using T1-weighted gradient-echo sequence. The imaging protocol included early imaging every 90 sec during the first six minutes followed by delayed imaging every 10 min up to one hour after injection of Gd-DTPA (0.2 mmol/kg). Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the center and periphery of lesions was performed. Results: On dynamic gadolinium -enhanced images, all lesions showed en hancement on the 90-sec images. On delayed images, decrease in signal intensity of the periphery and retension o f the contrast agent in the center (peripheral washout) was seen in 28 carcinom as and in none of the fibroade nomas. Simultaneous w ashout of the center and periphery was seen in 27 carcinomas and in all fibroadenom as.

Materials and Methods: Twenty-three patients (64.1 \u00b1 8.8 yrs) with peripheral bronchogenic carcinoma abutting the chest wall were prospectively included in the study. Two spiral CT acquisitions (5-mm thickness, 1:1 pitch, 3-mm interval reconstruction) through the neoplasm were performed during suspended in spiration and expiration. C hest wall invasion was first assessed on inspiratory scans according to the following criteria: obtuse angle between the tum or and the chest wall, > 3 cm contact, pleural thickening, extrapleural fat obliteration. Inspiratory and expiratory scans were then evaluated and changes in the lo cation of the tum or relative to the chest wall were assessed on corresponding scans. All patients underwent surgical resection of the tum or and CT findings were compared with pathologic findings. Results: At surgery chest wall invasion was present in 6/23 pts. Inspiratory scans showed 83.3% sensitivity when tw o criteria were combined, although the specificity w as only 35.3% (6/17 pts.) with an overall accuracy of 47.8%.

Methods and Materials: 26 patients with bronchial carcinom a were exam ined with contrast enhanced spiral C T after bolustracking (collim ation 2 mm, Somatom Plus 4, Siemens AG, Germany). Cine mode, surface shaded dis play (SSD) and maximum intensity projection (MIP) reconstructions of the pulm onary arteries and the tum ors were generated.

Results: All reconstruction m odes showed tum or infiltration into the pulmonary arteries in all examinations, but the diagnostic confidence was quoted best for the cross-sectional images evaluated in cine mode. Post chem otherapy ex am inations in 5 patients demonstrated reperfusion of prior subtotally occluded arteries. Conclusion: CT angiography of the pulm onary arteries in patients with bronchial carcinoma may help to assess vessel infiltration and may there fore be used fo r pre-and post-therapeutic staging in modern stage orientated therapy regimens.

Materials and Methods: Seven healthy subjects were exam ined on a whole body imager (1.5 T, Siemens) with a circular polarized head coil. Imaging was performed with fast FLASH-sequences (fast low angle shot). ENG and EEG measurements w ere taken simultaneously while the MRI sequences were acquired.

Imaging was performed on a 1.5 T MR-scanner using a standard head-coil. A single-slice T2*-weighted GE-sequence was used for functional imaging (TR 100 ms, TE 50 ms, a 40, slice thickness 10 mm, FOV 230, 256 X 256). A total of 40 images was measured with periodic stimulation (alternating 5 images rest and 5 images with stimulation). For stimulation we used the PC-version of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. Postprocessing was done at an external workstation (Sun Sparc 20). The fMRI data sets were spatial Gaussian filtered and motion corrected. Then the correlation coefficients were calculated and overlaid to the corresponding anatomical image. To create a com posite map of all single experiments the correlation maps were normated. Than for each pixel the mean correlation coefficient was calculated and overlaid to the corresponding normalised averaged anatomical image. Results: Increases in signal intensity that coincided with the test performance were observed with a preponderance of the right prefrontal area among sober condition. Activation was also in the mesial frontal cortex; a minor activation was detectable in the anterior part of the cinguli and in central regions (medial thalami nuclei) and in the tem poral lobe. After alcohol intake the activation in the frontal region was distributed bilaterally. W e found more activation in the anterior part of the cinguli. An additional activated area was the hippocampal region. Discussion: Analysing the effects of alcohol on the distribution of activation during a neuropsychological task, we found the more symmetrical response in frontal areas after alcohol intake as due to both, an increase in the left and a decrease in the right hemisphere response. The increase in the anterior cinguli most likely involves motivational and em otional mechanisms. The newly activated area in the hippocampal region following alcohol may be caused by a reduced influence o f the inhibition caused by enzymatic (GABAergic) mechanisms. Purpose: the evaluation of fM RI strategies and neural responses determined by a sound stimulation. FMRI allows a high spatial and tem poral resolution of the activation, a correct intrahem ispheric distinction between primary and sec ondary acoustic cortex and a precise mapping o f their involvement. Moreover, by means of special postprocessing aids, it is also possible to put in evi dence signal variations in brainstem nuclei, whose activation was completely unknown with previous imaging methods. Methods and Materials: the present study has been conducted on 21 healthy young volunteers with normal audiometrie results, by means of an highfield (1.5 T) MR unit (M agnetom Vision). The images underwent multiple statistical evaluation. Three different acoustic stimuli were used: white noise, a continuous 5 0 0 ,1 0 0 0 and 1500 Hz sinus tone, and a 1000 Hz pulsed sinus tone. Results: the functional activation determ ined a 5 to 10% signal increase. The activation mainly interested the primary auditory cortex and the insulae. Interestingly a significative but incostant (11/21) difference between the two hemispheres was also observed. The application o f a more sensible postpro cessing methods, the correlation analysis, on the guide of internally generated waveforms derived from the primary acoustic cortex, allowed the authors to detect the activation of auditory brainstem nuclei. Conclusion: the application of fMRI to the study o f the auditory system , due to the precise characterization of applied stimuli; a tonotopical analysis and an evaluation of brainstem auditory responses are also allowed.",

Results and Discussion: In gray and white matter NAA/ml was significantly different (t test). Particularly in gray matter it w as p < 0.001, without any overlap, and in white matter was p = 0.01. The Cluster Analysis (K-means clustering algorithm ) in the ml-NAA gray matter domain shows three clusters. All control subjects w ere in one cluster.

These clusters also differ by MMSE: C luster 1 had a mean MMSE value (< MMSE > ) equal to 17.1 and the Cluster 2 < MMSE> = 10. It is interesting to note that the mean values of ml in C luster 1 and 2 are very similar (4.33 and 4.21) while the values of NAA are substantially different (6.76 and 5.53). This suggests that proceeding to more severe cognitive im pairm ent (Cluster 2) there is only a variation in NAA while the level o f ml remains unchanged.

For control the voxel were also measured with a spin-echo sequence of 135 ms TE. In 10 volunteers we examined the parietooccipital grey/white matter and the cerebellar vermis (TR = 1.5 s, voxelsize 2x2x2 cm, AC = 128). Additionally 42 adults were investigated with various diseases of the CNS (16 = hepatic encephalopathy (HE), 4 = AIDS, 12 = tumour, 10 = alcoholism) and 16 children with neurological developm ent disorders. All spectroscopy examinations were com bined with conventional diagnostic imaging consiting of T 1 and T2 weighted images in axial and sagittal orientation. Results: All spectra with TE 5 ms showed an improved signal to noise ratio. Spectra with TE 135 ms demonstrated known changes in NAA and Cho. Lactate was detectable in 6 o f 16 children. Spectra with TE 5 ms showed additional changes in ml and Glx. Lipid signals were also visible between 0 -2.2 ppm, which varied in different diseases. In HE the changes o f ml and Glx were close related to the severity of the disease. In 2/4 m eningiomas alanin was seen and Cho elevated. Glioblastoma revealed characteristic changes like positive aliphatic lipid signals and reduced other metabolites. Patients with alcohol abuse showed a reduction in NAA, Cho, ml and a slight increase in Glx. Discussion: Localized \u0389 MRS with TE 5 ms is a real improvement in clinical spectroscopy of the brain and has the advantage to detect substances like ml and Glx. The application of sequences with short TE therefore permits additional information's in various diseases o f the brain.

The study protocol involved high spatial resolution CSI, quantification of T2-relaxation times and volumetric assessment of both tem poral lobes. The results in with TLE were compared with findings in 25 healthy volunteers. The data of CSI, T2-relaxometry and MR-volumetry were further assessed in reference to EEG and intraoperative electrodes. Results: CSI results show that the epileptogenic region is characterized by an abnormal pattern of lower N-acetylasperate (NAA) level and higher or unchanged Cholin (Cho) level. NAA/Cho is thus the most sensitive (85%) and specific (87%) and reliable quantitative index fo r the determ ination of abnormal areas of the temporal lobes in reference to EEG test results. T2-relaxometry and MR-volumetry are less sensitive (74% and 80%) and less specific (67% and 54%).

Patients to be treated usually already have had maximum tolerance radiation therapy, chemo-therapy o r suffer from tum ors which respond purely to these regimens. Because of the encouraging results endovascular stents are increasingly used even before radiation-or chemo-therapy are started to rapidly improve the patient's symptoms.. For the SVC stent diam eters of 14 to 16 mm and 10 to 14 mm fo r the brachio-cephalic veins are sufficient. Larger stents o f 20 to 30 mm diam eter are required fo r the IVC. Results and conclusions: A significant improvement with com plete relief of the V. cava syndrome can be expected in 70 to 100%. Especially shortness of breath, cyanosis and feeling of pressure in the head is relieved within hours w hereas edema o f head, neck and extremities usually take 1 to 2 days (in the lower extremities this may take several days). In our own experience with more than 30 patients total relief o f symptoms was achieved in 86% with an additional 7% with a partial relief until death (93% good to excellent results). Longterm patency usually lies in the range of 85% and more, however, due to tum or progression additional stents may have to be implanted. Stent placem ent is the method of choice in all malignant obstruction which may not be treated curatively by other means. The main interest of neck node imaging is in the clinically negative neck in pa tients with squamous cell carcinomas o f the head and neck. In these patients, negative imaging findings increase the likelyhood that this side of the neck is free of tum or and does not need treatment. In the clinically positive neck the main interest lies in assessing operability and thus invasion of vital structures. As the detection of minimal metastatic disease is concerned, imaging modali ties such as CT, MRI and US are hampered by their limitation o f distinguishing benign from metastatic lymph nodes. However, as MRI techniques evolve and C T resolution increases the accuracy of both techniques will increase. On the other hand, US guides aspiration can give cytologic evidence of benign or malignant cells within small lymph nodes and is a safe and easy technique. All imaging techniques have a limited accuracy and until now only few clinicians rely on imaging findings. In our opinion however, the reduction o f the risk of occult metastases by an accurate assessm ent with use of US guided aspira tion cytology warrants a wait and see policy in a significant number o f head and neck cancer patients. Since real time imaging of eye movement is necessary to investigate dynamic disorders, the purpose of our study was to introduce a fast MRI technique to investigate eye movement. Materials and Methods: Five healthy volunteers and five patients suffering from nystagmus on deviation were examined with fast MRI while holding different gaze positions, reading a defined text to demonstrate saccadic movements and maximal endpoint position to cause nystagmus when present. MRI w as performed on a 1.5 T equipm ent (Siemens). Spin-density weighted 2D-FLASH (fast low angle shot) sequence was used with a tem poral resolution o f six images per second. During MRI an ENG (elctronystagmogram) was performed in order to correlate MRI-findings. Results: In all cases we were able to delineate eye m ovem ent with fluoro scopic MRI. Anatomic and functional information could be obtained simultane ously with MRI and ENG fo r the first time. The nystagmus on deviation was visualized in those subjects, in which the frequency of eye motion was smaller then six per second.",

All images are then transferred to a cine-loop video recording which can be demonstrated as a movie. Excellent signal-to-noise ratio is achieved by this fast echo sequence and great anatomical detail is seen. Results: 5 Patients with TAO are analysed using dynam ic video-MRI of the eyes. The enlargement of extra-ocular eye muscles and increase o f retrobulbar fat tissue are clearly shown on the static images. Apart from this, stretching of the optic nerve in patients with exophthalm os is shown by dynamic video-MRI to contribute to the restricted movement. This can not be seen on the static images.

Conclusion: Dynamic video-MRI is a new excellent method to show the different causes of restricted eye-movement in patients with TAO. Apart from muscle-enlargement and the increase of retro-bulbar fat tissue, stretching of the optic nerve contributes to this restriction.

To evaluate the sensitivity of ultrasonographic am plitude colour Doppler imaging (ACDI) fo r visualizing low-velocity blood flows in small tortu ous vessels of the normal human eye. Methods and Materials: ACDI scans were performed with linear array probes at 6 -1 2 MHz using a Diasonics Gatew ay ultrasound scanner with ophthalmic acoustic output intensities. Scanning was done through acoustic coupling gel sheets over closed eyelids on the normal eyes of 10 human subjects. Results: Minor vessels could be more readily detected with ACDI than conventional frequency-shift colour Doppler imaging (GDI). Intraretinal blood flow could be traced to long segments of the central retinal artery and vein. Segments of the ophthalm ic artery, ophthalm ic veins, posterior ciliary arteries, and orbital vessels could be located. The tortuousity and branching of vessels could be seen, although entire vascular trees could not since they are entirely non-coplanar. Conclusion: W hile GDI may detect some long segments of blood flow in the eye and orbit, ACDI is more sensitive and can more easily follow the course of tortuous and branching ophthalm ic vessels in a single image frame. Methods and Materials: W e studied 30 patients affected by myopia. They were included into 3 different groups according to the different myopia degree. In all patients we pointed out the Peak Velocity (PV) and the Resistive Index (R l) by using a 7.5 MHz probe. Results: W e found out a PV decrease adn a Rl increase with statistic significance at the level of Ophtalmie Artery and P.L. Ciliary Arteries. These variations are more significant in the most serious myopia degrees. Conclusions: O ur series show a significative (p < 0.001) decrease in blood flow in the P.L. Ciliary arteries, expecially in serious myopia, that could be involved in the atrophic damage at the bulbar posterior pole, usually observed in these patients. ",

Both US and MR images ab extrascleral extension was suspected, but histopathology did not confirm it in one case US did not show extraocular extension but MR indicated indicated it. Histopathology confirmed the extension. Conclusions: Variations in the MRI appearance of uveal MMs may be dependent on their histological differences. However MRI is a useful tool in the evaluation of uveal MM, caution is highly advisable in diagnosing form MR images alone. Close collaboration between radiologist and ophthalm ologist ist required. The mucosa from the oesophagus to the second part of the duodenum is easily reached by modern endoscopes. Direct visualisation, coupled with the facility to obtain cells fo r cytology, tissue for histology and tissue fo r enzyme testing in the detection Helicobacter pylori, makes endoscopy a powerful diagnostic modality. Although double contrast barium radiology approaches the sensitivity of endoscopy fo r mucosal lesions, the appearances are often not sufficiently specific to allow definitive diagnosis without biopsy. The greatest value of barium radiology is in the investigation of m otility disorders. Thus the role of the radiologist in the structured, multidisciplinary approach to the investigation and treatment of swallowing disorders is fundam ental. Moreover, radiology can be invaluable in establishing the extent, morphology and functional significance of lesions such as strictures, diverticula, webs and fistulae, sometimes providing clinicians with a valuable anatomical map prior to surgery. Non-ionic contrast radiology is the mainstay in the investigation of suspected perforation and in the post-operative evaluation of resection anastam oses of oesophagus, stomach and duodenum. For lesions which involve layers deep to the mucosa, endoscopic ultrasound is superior to all other modalities in the definition of the depth and extent of abnormality and in the appreciation o f locally involved lymph nodes. Due to relatively poor resolution of local invasion and differentiation of involved lymph nodes, CT cannot accurately stage oesophageal and gastric tumours but can separate out those patients who have unresectable lesions o r distant metastases and thus spare them unnecessary explorative surgery. MRI has yet to establish superiority over CT in this field, except in the detection of hepatic metastases.",

Learning objective: To develop the rationale fo r optimizing CT and MR for detection and characterization o f liver lesions, and to recommend diagnostic imaging algorithm s fo r this task. The first clinical application of vascular metallic stents was performed in 1986. Since then, this new endovascular therapeutic method has taken more and more role, becoming the most important technic with balloon angioplasty for percutaneous treatm ent of vascular diseases. Among its indications, renal and fem oral arteries raise to some discussions. The use for subclavian and carotid arteries is more uncommon. Renal artery stenting is currently an interesting com plementary method to renal PTRA. It is possible to use the main kind o f stents available today: Palmaz, Strecker, Wallstent and others. Misplacement can occur mainly with the wallstent and the Strecker's stent but com plications are uncommon. The long term primary patency is about 75% , but it must be considered that the main indications are post-PTRA bad results. The indications range between 5 to 10% of overall PTRA. W e have to consider stents placem ent when the immediate post-PTRA result is insufficient according to the following criterias: residual stenosis supe rior to 30% associated with persisting pressure gradient superior to 20 mmHg. Others indications are: more than tw o post-PTRA recurrences, spontaneous iatrogenic o r traum atic renal artery dissection. It remains some discussion concerning ostial stenosis, due to the frequent insufficient post-PTRA result. The use of fem oro-popliteal artery stenting has strikingly decreased the last years due to the high rate of mid-term stenosis o r occlusion. Indeed the long term prim ary patency is inferior to 50% . The poorest results are mostly gotten in case of long lesions, with small caliber arteries and bad run-off. So, most of the main groups recommend the use of fem oro-popliteal artery stenting only in case of post-PTA immediate failures with threatening of acute ischemia of the limb. Some groups evaluate percutaneous grafts (covered metallic stent) as an endolum inal by-pass in case of long lesion of the fem oro-popliteal axis. It's earlier to assert that this new kind of stent could improve the long-term results of fem oro-popliteal artery stenting, but endolum inal grafts could be useful, as in others territories, in uncommon cases of popliteal aneurysms.",

Sebag; P aris/F 8:30-10:00 Room I Selection of the appropriate sequence of imaging studies fo r a given child and a given diagnostic problem has become a com plex undertaking. Investigations have to be tailored to the individual need of the child with Juvenile Chronic Arthritis (JCA) and a knowledge of the relative values o f available imaging techniques is mandatory. C onventional radiography is always the initial imaging step used to localize and to define the nature o f a lesion. Therefore most o f all, plain film s allow active exclusion of other causes. Furthermore, conventional radiographs allow grouping to the various arthritides and staging of disease progression. Ultrasound is very sensitive in the detection o f joint effusion, especially in the hip, and guides fluid aspiration. Ultrasound and Doppler can be used fo r the evaluation o f synovial hypertrophy and activity. Arthrography and to a certain extent nuclear studies have been replaced by MRI. C ontrast enhanced MRI is the most sensitive modality to determ ine whether an arthritic condition is present but, usually does not assist in establishing a specific diagnosis. MRI determ ines accurately the activity o f disease and the extent of articular damage. Finally, MRI is of m ajor importance in the evaluation of response to local therapy and the detection o f complications. The num ber of different gadolinium chelates on the market and in preclinical and clinical research is perm anently increasing. More than four different intravenous com pounds are available fo r daily routine. All of them are safe com pounds with non-specific applications. Considering their relaxivities and biodistribution, the clinical dosage o f these com pounds lies around 0.1 mil limole/kg body weight. Attem pts are made to further decrease the injected dose through an enhancem ent of the relaxivities of the complexes. Theory describes some pathways to achieve this goal but subtle features o f the molec ular dynam ics such as the rate of the exchange of w ater limit the increase. To improve their diagnostic value which possibly requires higher doses, some concern has appeared about the osm olality of the formulations. The latest two products of the first generation o f these contrast agents are non/ionic and low osmolar. Because of their low m olecular weight and hydrophilicity, the com pounds o f the first generation are non-specific markers of the extravascular/extracellular space. Increased organ/specificity w as reached by increasing the affinity of the com plexes fo r membrane receptors and/or plasm a proteins, com bining hepatocyte specificity with plasm a kinetics similar to that of first generation gadolinium agents. Specific markers of the intravascular domain, potentially useful fo r MR angiography and perfusion assessment are devel oped by synthesis of macromolecular paramagnetic system s deriving from gadolinium com plexes. The field o f interventional biliary radiology is rapidly evolving. The skills of percutaneous biliary drainage, balloon dilation, and stent placement are now basic requirements fo r all interventional radiologist. Among the recent advances in interventional biliary radiology we can include the use of metallic stents in malignat strictures, percutaneous cholangioscopy, which can be used to perform lithotripsy and biopsy, and the introduction of combined radiological/endoscopic procedures. These techniques will be presented in the format of a \"Video presentation\". Clinical cases that can be encountered in common practice will be shown and discussed. The different possible and alternative solutions to common problem s will be presented and critically analyzed. Emphasis is put on selection and use of materials fo r interventional radiology, and m anagem ent o f technical problem s encountered during the different procedures. This session will describe multiple approaches to com plex biliary intervention in m alignant disease. The use of bilateral stents fo r periportal obstruction versus stenting a single left o r right side will be detailed. Combination procedures with endoscopists as well as com plicated cases and follow -up results will be given. The general concepts and importance o f radiologic intervention in periportal disease as well as com plications and problem s with percutaneous stent placement will be em phasized.

For tumors, trauma and inflammation the respective role of CT and MR will be discussed. The impact o f interventional angiography in vascular lesions will be illustrated. Methods and Materials: Twenty-nine nodules at the jugulodigastric region (15 to 54 mm in size) from 28 patients were examined with CDUS. Inclusion criterion was an uncertain parotid origin at gray-scale US (7 .5 -1 3 MHz). Nodules were classified as intra-or extraglandular according to origin of their supplying vessels: those receiving intraparotid vessels were assumed to be intraglandular, those accepting vessels from neck spaces were extraglandular. The pathologic diagnosis of each nodule was obtained at biopsy. Results: At biopsy, 18/29 nodules were from parotid, including both benign (n = 16) and malignant (n = 2) hystotypes; the others were neck masses, including branchial cysts (n = 2) and benign (n = 4) or malignant (n = 5) lymph nodes. In all but two cases, C DUS showed a discrete vasculature supplying the nodules. Among the intraparotid nodules, 15 had vessels com ing exclusively from the gland; 2 had vessels o f indeterm inate source, and one, malignant, received multiple vessels from both gland and neck spaces. Extraparotid nodules accepted vessels com ing only from the neck spaces. Conclusion: CDUS can help to assess the intra-o r extraparotid nature of jugulodigastric nodules o f uncertain origin. To determine whether high-resolution power D oppler imaging might enable differentiation of benign from m alignant cervical lymphadenopathy. Materials and Methods: Forty cervical lym phadenopaties in 33 untreated patients were prospectively examined with high-frequency (10 MHz) power Doppler imaging and subsequently submitted to percutaneous biopsy (n = 31) or surgical excision (n = 9). The distribution o f nodal size w as not significantly different fo r benign and malignant nodes. Lymph node vascularity w as graded on a four-step analog scale of 0 to +++ and classified as either peripheral or hilar, depending on the distribution of vessels. Results: Histology revealed 22 m alignant lymph nodes (16 metastatic nodes and 6 nodes with prim ary lymphatic malignancies) and 18 benign (reactive) lymph nodes. Benign lym phadenopaties showed a low er grade of vascularity than did malignant lymphadenopaties. Eleven (79% ) of 14 hypovascular nodes classified as 0 (n = 5) and + (n = 9) were benign. Conversely, 11 (92%) of 12 nodes labeled as +++ were malignant. Detection o f peripheral flow significantly correlated (P < 0.01) with malignant nodes. No differences w ere observed between primary and secondary nodal malignancies. Results: 54 of the 468 histologically examined lymph node groups were positive, w hereas 414 were negative. FDG-PET and CT had a sensitivity for all lymph node groups o f 73% and 68% and a specificity o f 99% and 97%, respectively. The sensitivity fo r the subdigastric lymph node groups was 87% with both FDG-PET and CT, and the specificity w as 90% and 84%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the results of FDG-PET and CT with respect to the detection of lymph node metastases.",

On the C T scan, tum or m asses were hyperdense with contrast enhancement. On the MR images, their signals were variable.

Material and Methods: Forty-two HIV positive patients with recent neuro logical symptoms underwent brain enhanced-C T and MR imaging (T2 and T1-weighted SE images, before and after gadolinium administration were ob tained). For each examination, a double-blind analysis was performed, and one or tw o diagnosis were proposed. The final diagnosis was obtained by clinical, biological, histological data, and/or follow up.

            "text": "797 Ultrasound in infertility: The use of a \"pivotal scan\" incorporating hystero contrast sonography (HyCoSy) to investigate infertility \u0422.\u041d. Bourne, P. Schw\u00e4rzier, \u041a. Shah; London/U K Background: Fallopian tube disease remains a major cause of infertility for couples. The current \"gold standard\" of laparoscopy fo r assessing tubal pa tency is invasive and may be associated with delay. The use o f a simple outpatient test in this context would be of benefit. The developm ent of ultra sound contrast agents has enabled the use of transvaginal ultrasonography to reliably outline the endometrial cavity and Fallopian tubes. The technique is well tolerated as an outpatient and takes about 15 to 20 minutes to perform. At the same examination details of ovarian morphology and function can also be derived. Results: There have been 8 m ajor clinical studies involving over 1,880 patients. The mean tim e o f the examination was 11 minutes (range 4 -3 0 ), and the mean volum e of Echovist used 12 mis (range 4 -3 0 mis). The technique was well tolerated, only 7% of patients report severe pain, and 5% other adverse effects (nausea, syncope o r bleeding). Only 2 cases o f PID were reported. Hycosy com pares favourably with other reference techniques for assessing tubal patency. Compared to laparoscopy the sensitivity fo r patent tubes was 88%, specificity 59% , PPV 85%, NPV 67% . In com parison to HSG the sensitivity for patent tubes was 86%, specificity 84%, PPV 96% , NPV 58%. Discussion: Hycosy offers a relatively non-invasive test of tubal patency that can be performed in any outpatient environm ent. It has the potential to be carried out at an early stage of the algorithm to investigate the infertile couple and so may lead to more rapid efficient treatment. The added information available about ovarian morphology and function m eans th a t there is the potential to use ultrasonography in a pivotal role at the time of the initial consultation, enabling treatm ent to be planned more efficiently. Along with ultrasound and selective tubal catheterization, magnetic resonance imaging now plays a m ajor role in the work up o f an infertility. On the female side a pregnancy will require a normal ovulation, meaning a normal pituitary gland and normal ovaries. After conception has occurred in the fallopian tube, nidation and developm ent of the em bryo requires a normal sized and shaped uterus. This talk will focus on the technical aspects of MRI in the fem ale pelvis, and on its impact in pathologic conditions impairing fertility: dysovulations (polycystic ovarian disease, endometriosis, pituitary disorders) and uterine pathology (fibromas, mullerian m a lform a tions,...). Signal intensities o f articular structures were measured and contrastto-noise (\u0421/N ) ratios were calculated. Each knee was subdivided into ten cartilage surfaces. From a total o f 188 (3D ERI sequence) and 198 (3D GE se quence) cartilage surfaces, 73 and 79 histologic specimens could be obtained and used fo r analysis. MR grading of cartilage lesions on both sequences was based on a five grade classification scheme and compared to histologic grading.",

Diagnosis of sarcoidosis was established based on clinical, sero logical and BAL findings. The H.R.C.T. examinations were evaluated searching for the following findings: hilar and mediastinal nodal involvement, thickening o r irregularity of the broncovascular bundle, intraparenchym al nodules, septal lines, ground-glass opacities and parenchymal consolidation, pleural thicken ing, fibrosis with architectural distortion. To each of this sign a score was given ranging from 0 to 3, reflecting the affected volum e: 0 -no involvement, 1-up to 33%, 2-up to 66%, 3-more than 66% . The interstitial signs of disease activity were evaluated not considering nodal involvement alone or patients with pulmonary fibrosis.

According to method section, we scored the main group o f 18 observations with pulm onary abnormalities: 12 observations had a score between 1 and 3; 2 observations had a score between 4 and 7; 4 observations had a score between 7 to 9. The X-Ray chest study o f each of these H.R.C.T. observation was independently exam inated using the ILO classification of thoracic sarcoidosis and looking fo r clear pulm onary involvement. Four of the X-Ray chest of the first tw o H.R.C.T. groups (14 observations) were positive fo r pulm onary involvement, while all 4 chest radiographs of the third group were pathological. Conclusions: In mild to and moderate pulm onary sarcoidosis H.R.C.T. is more sensitive, com pared with conventional radiology, to detect subtle initial signs of pulm onary disease, allowing an earlier and more precise quantification of the disease. To determine the prevalence of lung changes distribution, a retrospective study o f patients with histologicaly proven sarcoidosis type 1 (lym phadenopathy only on radiograph) was undertaken. 68 high-resolution com puted tom ography (HRCT) studies were revived. Two radiologists independently evaluated the HRCT scans fo r predom inance segmental opacities distribution. HRCT detected abnorm alities in lung parenchyma in 32 patients with type 1 sarcoidosis.

Methods and Materials: Conventional chest CT scans of forty-two patients with confirmed pulm onary sarcoidosis of recent onset were reviewed, focusing on a) topographic classification of enlarged lymph nodes according to ATS mapping system b) m easurement o f the maximum short axis fo r each nodal group. Results: A) Mediastinal lym phadenopathy was present in 88% of the patients. The most frequently involved nodal groups were: 4R (right low er paratracheal) 79% , group 7 (subcarinal) 67%, group 5 (aortopulmonary) 64%, 11R/11L (hi lar) 61 %. Lym phadenopathy was observed in atypical locations such as group 14 and internal mammary nodes. No recognisable pattern of nodal group com bination w as confirmed, neither a consistent relation between sites of lymphadenopathy and features o f parenchymal involvement. B) The maximum and the mean values of short axis for the various nodal groups were respec tively: 2R -* 2.8 cm and 1.6 cm, 2L -\u00bb 2 cm and 1.5 cm, 4R -> 2.2 cm and 1.5 cm, 4 L -* 2 cm and 1.4 cm, group 5 -*\u25a0 2 cm and 1.2 cm, group 6 -> 1.3 cm and 1.2 cm, group 7 -> 4 cm and 2 cm, group 8 -\u00bb 2.5 cm and 1.8 cm, 10R -* 2.2 cm and 1.5 cm, 10L -*\u25a0 1.8 cm and 1.2 cm, 11R 2 cm and 1.5 cm, 11L -\u00bb 2 cm and 1.4 cm, group 14 -* 2 cm and 1.1 cm. Conclusion: ATS mapping scheme could serve as a standard lymph node classification system in sarcoidosis, ensuring uniformity and comparability of studies. Lymph node enlargement, greater than 2.8 cm should not favour the diagnosis of sarcoidosis and might be of value in narrowing the differential diagnosis of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Purpose: To determ ine w hether a correlation exists between pulmonary function and both frontal chest radiograph and high-resolution CT findings in patients with pulm onary alveolar proteinosis (PAP). Materials and Methods: Seven patients with PAP were studied on 25 occa sions using high-resolution C T (n = 21), frontal chest radiographs (n = 19), and pulm onary function tests (n = 25). Visual estimates on the extent, degree, and overall severity of lung opacification and reticulation were determ ined for plain radiographs and high-resolution CT, and were correlated with pulmonary function tests (PFT). Results: On high-resolution CT, the severity of ground glass opacity corre lated significantly with the presence of a restrictive ventilatory defect, reduced diffusing capacity, and hypoxemia (p < 0.01). The extent o f ground glass and reticular opacities correlated better with PFT than did the degree of opacificaton. Chest radiographic findings correlated well with restrictive ventilatory defect and diffusing capacity and hypoxemia (p < 0.05). Conclusion: In patients with PAP, high-resolution CT and plain radiographic findings correlate with pulm onary function and are of potential use in follow-up.",

The presence of pulm onary hypertension w as not related to sex, age or duration of disease. Conclusion: W e conclude that in patients with no detectable fibrotic changes pulmonary hypertension is secondary to vascular changes. The correlation of pulmonary hypertension in mild or extensive LF suggests either a dependent developm ent or an additional hemodynamic effect to vascular changes. The concurrence of non-neoplastic pulm onary lymphocytic infiltration with amyloid deposition has been reported in the pathological literature. However, the distinctive high-resolution CT (HRCT) features in PLH associated with amyloid deposition have not previously been documented. Methods and Materials: Interest in the pathological-radiological features of a patient with proven PLH, amyloid and concurrent Sjogren's syndrome led to a review of our pathological database for other sim ilar cases. Two further cases were docum ented and the clinical, HRCT and pathological findings in three patients are discussed. Results: A history of progressive exertional dyspnoea was present in all three cases. Sjogren's syndrome was a feature in tw o patients. Obstructive lung function indices were present in all cases. All patients were life-long non-smokers. Chest radiography showed bilateral bizarre-shaped opacities; HRCT confirmed that many of the nodules were calcified and non-cavitating. A striking feature was the dem onstration of multiple bilateral thin-walled cysts, some of which abutted nodules. In one case, a pattern of \"mosaic attenuation\", attributed to small airways obstruction, was also demonstrated. Conclusion: The HRCT abnorm alities of the three cases described were sufficiently distinctive to allow differentiation from other causes of pulmonary cysts and nodules on CT.

Contiguous axial proton-density (PD) weighted, 1 mm thick slices were obtained with a pixelsize of 80 \u0434 \u0442 2. Also, images were obtained with increasing T2-weighting, and with increasing T1-weighting. Results: PD-weighted images showed the spinal cord with superb contrast and detail. Increasing T1-o r T2-weighting did not improve contrast o r image quality. No abnorm alities were found in control specimens. In all MS speci mens, areas o f increased signal intensity (SI) were seen. They were mostly wedge-shaped and located in the lateral w hite matter. However, grey matter was also affected in all cases. In 5 o f 10 cases abnorm alities were contiguous throughout the specimen. These abnorm alities had higher SI than did focal areas. 2D tim e-of-flight (TOF) axial sequence without and with superior saturation pulse was performed when presumed nerve roots enhancement occurred. A control group of twenty patients underw ent a sim ilar protocol. Results: 50% of symptomatic patients showed presumed nerve roots e n hancement, with no pain side-correlation in 45.5% . The presumed root e n hancement was always detected on TOF sequences, disappearing in 96% after superior saturation pulse. True nerve root enhancem ent was seen only in one patient affected by spinal dural fistula. The FRE was detected in 4 patients. 45% o f asymptomatic patients showed sim ilar findings. In 7 cases, FRE w as detected on the first entry-slice. Conclusion: According to our results, presumed radicular enhancem ent in symptomatic and asym ptom atic patients seem s to be generally related to great radicular veins. W e suggest 2D TO F sequences should be added to the standard lum bar MRI protocol when spinal roots enhancem ent in symptomatic patients has to be investigated. Results: MR demonstrated patchy areas of increased signal intensity in the white-m atter tracts on T2-weighted images in all cases, in each case corresponding to an area of the cord believed to be clinically involved (1 cervical and dorsal tract, 1 cervical tract alone and 1 dorsal tract alone). Conclusion: MRI has proved to be reliable in the detection of intramedullary lesions due to decompression accident that were previously undetectable by other neuroim aging methods. Further MRI has proved to be useful to make decision on how to structure a prompt hyperbaric treatment. Results: In 7 of 10 patients with dilated veins in the X-ray myelography, MRI and DSA confirmed a AVM in the thoracic spine. In three patients MRI and DSA only could identify dilated veins in the thoracolum bar region caused by severe spinal stenoses. In one female patient DSA had be repeated twice to identify an AVM, w hereas high resolution MRI using a 3D-CISS scheme was able to detect all spinal dural arteriovenous malformation. Conclusion: Flow com pensated high resolution MRI using a 3D-CISS se quence is useful in the selection of patients with AVM. The sensitivity of the MR method is higher com pared with conventional X-ray myelography and com parable with DSA. Results: Thoracal spine was involved in 11 cases w hereas lumbar spine was involved in 9 cases and cervical spine in 5 cases. Paraspinal and epidural abscess formation were seen in 95% o f all cases. Of these, patients with thoracal and cervical involvement presented with neurologic symptoms. In approximately 65% of all cases, pulm onary tuberculosis was present as well. Discussion: Extrapulmonary tuberculosis occurs in approxim ately 10 -25% of cases. Spine is one o f the most frequent locations. Symptoms and signs may be unspesific and the course of the disease is usually creeping. Neurologic findings may predominate, particularly in cervical or thoracal involvement. Determining the precise localization and extention of the paraspinal and epidural abscesses is crucial for planning of the operation. MR should be the imaging modality of choice for these patients.

W ith both coils a turbo-spin-echosequence (TR = 5000, TE = 132 ms) w as used to obtain T2-weighted images throughout the prostate and seminal vesicles in axial and coronal orientations. MR-findings were correlated with histopatholocial findings by one reader. Results: Overall image quality was best with the cp-phased-array coil. Artifacts in phase-encoding-direction were a reason for reduced image quality with the endorectal coil. Tumor spread through the prostate capsule and invasion o f the seminal vesicles were slightly better recognized with the endorectal coil. The phased-array technique was superior to endorectal imaging in dem onstrating cancer in the anterior gland and in the apex. Using the endorectal coil a second com plem entary examination with the body-array coil was necessary for lymph node staging. Conclusions: MR-imaging with a cp-phased-array coil offers advantages in comparison to the endorectal coil, as sim plier coil m anagement, sufficient staging results, reduced image artifacts and shorter exam ination time. The endorectal coil should be reserved for younger patients, who should undergo nerve sparing prostate surgery. bolus Gd-DTPA in 16 patients with biopsy proven prostate cancer with no previous treatm ent were performed. Corresponding T2W images were re viewed independently by 2 radiologists to identify the presence and location o f normal peripheral zone (PZ. 14), BPH (7) and m alignant tum our (13). ROI analysis from enhanced FLASH images using in-house software to measure enhancem ent param eters (m ean gradient, maximal amplitude and washout) were correlated with anatom ical information from T2W images. Results: Significant differences were noted between normal PZ and malignant tum our with respect to mean gradient (p = 0.006) and washout (p = 0.012), but not with respect to maxim al am plitude of enhancement.

Accuracy was globally similar at 72%. (k = 0.1971; weighted \u043a = 0.3043). The correlation of the performances of MRI with rectal examination, blood PSA levels, and Gleason score will be discussed. Conclusion: Endorectal MRI has the best specificity for the subgroup of patients with a negative DRE, low PSA level and low combined Gleason score. Significant interobservor variability was noted. Six sextant biopsies were performed 2 to 4 weeks prior to MRI. Core cancer length, ratio between core cancer length and total core length, as well as the number of positive biopsies were calculated. All patients underwent radical prostatectomy. Results: At pathological examination, 33 patients had a confined tum or and 20 a non confined tumor. MRI showed a 45% sensitivity and a 93% specificity fo r predicting extra prostatic tum or spread. To obtain a com parable specificity with biopsies, the cutoff value of the 3 studied param eters was 36 mm, 70% and more than 3 positive biopsies (mean 5 \u00b1 0.7)) with a sensitivity of 25, 15, and 55% respectively. Combination o f MRI and system atic biopsies yielded a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 88%. LITT followed a programme of decreasing power settings (20 W -7 W). Each prostatic lobe was irradiated from a t least one optical fibre position. Results: Average pretherapeutic prostate volum e was 68.6 ml (reprotucibility \u00b1 5%). Laser optical fibres were always clearly demarcated in the prostatic tissue, and endoscopic positioning could be opim ized, particularly in difficult areas near the prostatic capsule, base, and apex. Signal intensity changes S 170 of 20 -25% on T1-weighted images obtained during LITT energy application were observed with two different laser system s operating at 1,064 nm and 830 nm. Posttherapeutic changes could be followed up over more than 6 months. The purpose of this study was to evaluate laser induced changes in the prostate using endorectal MRI. Imaging findings were correlated to wholemount specimen. Methods: In 8 patients with prostate carcinoma, VLAP was performed during lymphonodectomy. Radical prostatectomy w as performed 4 -9 days (mean 6.9 days) following VLAP. All patients underwent endorectal MRI before VLAP and again between 12 to 24 hours prior to surgery. Imaging findings were correlated to macroscopic and histologic whole-m ount specimen. Results: Benign liver lesions showed a significant signal loss (PSIL) in proton density-weighted images (p < 0.05), w hereas malignant liver lesions showed almost no (p > 0.05) (Wilcoxon test). FNH-nodules and adenom as revealed a decrease of signal using AMI-25-enhanced T2-weighted images. Lesions changed from isointensity unenhanced to moderate hyperintensity in contrastenhanced T1-weighted scans. Adenomas presented a contrast-enhancing capsule in T2-weighted AMI-25-enhanced MRI. A hypointense signal was documented fo r hemangiomas unenhanced changing to hyperintensity in T1weighted AMI-25-enhanced scans. Malignant liver lesions w ere hyperintense using unenhanced and contrast-enhanced scans. M etastases due to colorectal cancer revealed a hyperintense rim enhancem ent in T1-w eighted AMI-25enhanced scans. Conclusion: AMI-25-enhanced MRI is an effective imaging tool fo r differential diagnosis of focal liver lesions using T2-and T1-w eighted sequences to define lesion specific enhancement of benign versus malignant liver lesions. Material and Methods: Twenty-five patients with focal liver lesions underwent T2-weighted turbospin-echo MR im aging using fat suppression before and after intravenous administration of Resovist (0.9 ml in patients with body weight from 35 to < 60 kg, 1.4 ml in patients > 60 kg). Mean signal intensity (SI) of unenhanced and enhanced MR imaging was measured. Results: SI of normal liver tissue and spleen decreased after administration of RESOVIST with mean decreases o f -5 7 \u00b1 15% and -4 5 \u00b1 16%, respectively. SI of hemangiomas (n = 14) and benign liver tum ors (n = 3) decreased with mean decreases of -3 5 \u00b1 11%, -4 6 \u00b1 10%. All malignant liver lesions (n = 8) showed no enhancement. The difference o f SI changes between malignant and benign lesions and/or hemangiomas induced by RESOVIST w ere statis tically different (p < 0.05), w hereas SI changes between hem angiom as and benign tum ors were not statistically different. Benign lesions showed similar enhancement pattern as com pared to normal liver tissue. No statistically sig nificant difference in SI changes was demonstrated using T2-TSE without and with fa t suppression.

The detectability of lesions on SPIO-enhanced images was improved by 28% in the slightly T2weighted sequence (\u0422 \u04122030\u042f \u0415 45) and by 22% in the T2-weighted sequence (TR2030/TE90). Especially the num ber of detectable foci smaller than 1 cm increased. Conclusions: SPIO is an effective contrast agent for the detection of focal hepatic lesions. For characterization unenhanced T 1 -and T2-weighted images are undispensable, nevertheless the specificity still needs to be improved. New imaging techniques such as ultrafast sequences will bring further advances in image quality and demarcation o f vascular structures versus small lesions. Methods and Materials: Images of 592 patients with suspected focal liver lesions from 17 MR-centres were evaluated by 4 off-site independent radiol ogists. The independent evaluation included lesion counts and determination of the level of the lesion conspicuity, quality o f lesion delineation, and grading of confidence in lesion detection and diagnosis. In 147 cases the diagnosis of liver lesions was proven histologically. In 117 cases MnDPDP enhanced MRI images were com pared to contrast enhanced C T (CECT). Results: Post-MnDPDP images of the liver allowed detection of more lesions (p < 0.0001), increased confidence for detection (p < 0.0001), improved lesion conspicuity (p < 0 .0001) and increased confidence in the diagnosis of the lesion (p < 0.0001) compared to unenhanced T1W and T2W images. Comparing MnDPDP enhanced MR images to CECT, MRI was significantly better fo r lesion characterization, but not for detection. Based on lesion histology, independent investigators made a correct diagnosis on the pre-MnDPDP images in 59% of lesions and in 66% o f lesions on the post-MnDPDP images.",

For fixed compression ratios the DP on w avelet com pressed mammogram s is consistently better than that of JPEG. Results: Bayes Theorem has frequently been used to determine the prob ability of malignancy of a solitary pulmonary nodule. Determination of this probability using Bayes Theorem requires knowledge of the joint probability of occurrence of many subject (e.g. age, smoking history) and nodule (e.g. size, edge, calcification) vari\u00e2tes. The fundam ental requirement fo r the estimation of these joint probabilities is a knowledge database of the joint occurrence of these many subject and nodule vari\u00e2tes which is enormous and usually not obtainable. To simplify the task of estimating these joint probabilities, assumptions are made as to independence o f the occurrence of these vari \u00e2tes (e.g. that age is independent of smoking history, nodule size and edge characteristics, etc) as this permits the multiplication of univariate probabilities to determ ine the joint probabilities. Conclusions: Bayes Theorem , while a reasonable conceptual model, is not an appropriate m athem atical model for the actual estimation of the probability of malignancy. Alternative m athem atical models, such as the logistic regression function, are more appropriate as they do not require the assumption of independence, even allowing fo r nonlinear relationships between the fact vari\u00e2tes. Estimation of the logistic regression coefficients is straightforward and requires a smaller knowledge data base as few er parameters must be estimated.

Nineteen w ere discharged after investigations excluded active disease. Of those considered normal by the radiographer, seven were recalled for additional views after radiological review.

Appendicular and axial exam inations were included and all examinations were reported independently by three consultant radiologists. Examinations were included if there was agreem ent between the radiolog ical reports (prevalence o f abnorm al exam inations = 37% ). Radiographers identified if the radiographic appearances were considered to be normal or abnormal, and written com m ents provided. Accuracy, sensitivity and specificity rates were calculated. Pre-test/post-test com parisons were also made. Results: Accuracy at the end of the postgraduate programme was > 95%. Sensitivity and specificity, 94.9% and 95.5% respectively. Accuracy for the control group was 91% dem onstrating a significant difference in all three performance measures used (p = 0.02). Initial findings in a study of over 6000 examinations, suggest that 95% com petence rates are being maintained after completion of the programme. Final results of this study will be also presented. Conclusion: Radiological workloads and the num ber o f interventional proce dures are rapidly increasing and this study suggests that radiographers, after completion of an accredited programme, could provide valuable assistance in the plain film reporting of traum a examinations of the skeletal system. Methods and Materials: W e studied, in a year, 3640 paediatric patients aged 1 day -14 years. All examinations were conducted on a digital spot fluorography system Gilardoni DRS Spot connected to a Telegil SL digit remote-controlled diagnostic X-ray stand. The system is dedicated to the acquisition of dynamic digital images in fast tem poral sequences with continuous photon flow (25 images x sec) and with pulsed flow with the emission o f single or serial high photon flow impulses. The exam inations carried out include: contrast gastrointestinal and genitourinary radiology, and direct radiology of the air ways. Results: The system offers a series o f advantages: imaging post-processing, fast storage and retrieval o f images, real tim e image display, reduction in film consumption, variable field of view, relative dose reduction, no cassette handling, etc. The disadvantages include: low spatial resolution, small fields of view. Conclusions: T he experience obtained over several months of working with digital fluorography on paediatric patients had led us to confirm the diagnostic efficiency of digital fluorography in all contrast exam inations and its technical flexibility. In this respect a change of attitude is required to radiographers who have to combine their \"classic\" knowledge with the culture of the optimization of the diagnostic images in order to maximize the information. 1 1 -1 5 year) .

A larger evaluation is needed but m ost of the current publications in the literature agree with the prominent clinical im pact o f the state of the art spiral CT angiography as a first intention procedure. Precise staging is the key to rational m anagem ent of bronchial carcinoma. A large benefit in CT-surgical correlations is expected with spiral CT using 2 to 3 mm thin sections routinely. Direct carcinomatous extension to the superior vena cava, the adjacent pulm onary artery o r vein may lead to modification of the surgical treatment planning. In estimation o f the benefits drawn from neoad juvant chemotherapy, strictly com parative performances of spiral acquisition, injection and reconstruction techniques are m andatory fo r precise measure ments and quantification of the response. Endobronchial treatm ents require an optimal knowledge o f both endo and peribronchial extension of the tumor.

Fused images combining planar reform ation and isodoses can also help calculate the radiation dose to surrounding vessels and prevent m ajor hemoptysis. What can we expect in the near future? The concept of using spiral C T as a physiologic tool has just appeared. It can offer a large field of investigation. These CT-physiologic correlations demand dram atic reduction in scan times per revolution. The use o f two-dim ensional detectors in the form of multiples arrays or image plates may be a solution.

Until recently, various noninvasive im ag ing procedures have been used to detect pulmonary embolism, including ventilation-perfusion scanning, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and conven tional computed tom ography (CT). The nonspecificity of ventilation-perfusion imaging and the respective limitations of conventional C T and MR imaging provide an explanation why pulm onary angiography remains the usual stan dard in the detection of pulm onary embolism. However, this procedure carries a significant incidence o f morbidity and mortality which justifies the current need for an accurate and noninvasive diagnostic modality. Recent improvement in scanner technology has led to the introduction of spiral CT and ultrafast CT and, to date, several investigators have already evaluated the role of these newly developed C T technologies in the recognition of central pulmonary emboli.

Purpose: A European four centre study was performed to com pare breast MRI with state of the art mammography, using histology as the gold standard. Three different doses were employed to determ ine the optim al dose and extend the safety profile of ProHance (gadoteridol) Bracco. Methods and Materials: 84 patients (previously exam ined by mammography), scheduled to undergo surgery leading to a definitive histological diagnosis, were enrolled. Patients received a contrast enhanced MRI examination with either 0.1, 0.2 or 0.3 mmol/kg P ro H a n ce -. Diagnostic efficacy w as assessed by the investigators and tw o blinded readers by com paring each technique with histology. Adverse events and vital signs were recorded. Results: Sensitivity w as slightly low er than the com bined diagnosis (from mammography, ultrasound and cytology), but additional information provided by MR changed management in 7% and was used in treating 32% of patients. A dose of 0.2 o r 0.3 mmol/kg was more effective than 0.1 mmol/kg. Six non-serious adverse events were reported. All patients recovered fully. Conclusion: ProHance\u00ae is a safe and effective contrast medium for breast MRI. Although sensitivity w as slightly lower than fo r mammography, a dose o f 0.2 mmol/kg ProHance\u00ae provided additional information which impacted on patient management. In addition the enhancem ent behaviour of normal and dysplastic breast tissue with respect to the menstrual was evaluated in another 100 patients, who had been exam ined once. Results: One third of the patients with significant enhancement in normal or proliferative breast tissue showed significantly less contrast enhancement in the first part of the menstruation cycle. In another third we found only slightly less contrast enhancement. In one third there w as diagnostically relevant change of the contrast enhancem ent during the menstruation cycle. Conclusion: Therefore we recommend to perform contrast enhanced MRI of the breast generally in the first half of the menstruation cycle (day 5-10). Purpose: Routinely, dynam ic T1 weighted sequences \u00b1 KM-application are used for the MR investigation of the female breast. In addition, T2-weighted sequences are em ployed to detect cysts or cystic parts o f solid lesions. Over the last years, new T2-w eighted sequences with and without fat suppression have been developed. The aim of this study was to compare different T2 weighted sequences fo r detection of breast cysts. P a tie n ts an d Methods: 20 women (age 1 8 -6 4 yrs.) with sonographically proven breast cysts were investigated with 6 different sequences: TSE, UTSE (TR = 4000/TE = 125), TSE and UTSE with SPIR (TR = 4500\u041b\"\u0415 = 120), and GRASE with and without SPIR(TR = 4000/TE = 120), on a 1.5 T unit (Philips Gyroscan NT1.5 T). Images were reviewed independently by tw o radiologists fo r the num ber of detectable lesions and their characteristics: size, shape, margins, and hom ogeneity as well as fo r presence of artifacts. All parameters were graded on a 0 -3 score. In addition, S/N and lesion contrast ratios were calculated. Results: Cysts were better delineated by sequences with fat suppression, w here TSE-SPIR and UTSE-SPIR proved to be slightly superior to GRASE-SPIR. More cysts could be identified, they could be better differentiated from the surrounding tissue.

Results: 150 patients with silicon implants after mastectom y have been examined. Later than 6 mos. postoperatively enhancement within the scar tissue was usually insignificant. Problems occurred in 8 patients with focally enhancing granulomas and in 9 patients with diffuse enhancement due to reactive-inflamm atory changes, but could in 50% o f the cases be solved by follow-up. 9/10 recurrences enhanced strongly, 1/10 moderately and 2/10 delayed. 4 of them and 3 cases o f multifocality w ere only detected by MRI.

Postiglione, \u0412. Alfano, M. Salvatore; Naples/I Purpose: Assessment of brain atrophy in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) with an unsupervised autom ated segmentation tech nique based on multispectral images of relaxation rates and proton density, calculated from pairs o f spin-echo sequences. Materials and Methods: Conventional spin echo MR studies (1.5 T), covering the entire brain were performed in 50 normal subjects (age range 16 -76) and in 8 patients with suspected DAT (age range 56 -6 4 ). A 3D spectrum o f the tissue voxels was generated fo r segmentation of gray matter, w hite matter and cerebro-spinal fluid, and used calculation of their fractional volum es (fGM, fWM and fCSF, respectively) (Alfano \u0412. et al., MRM, Nov 1996 In Press). Results: Expected age-related changes of fGM (-1 .3 1 % y e a r-1 ) and fCSF (+1.55% \u00b7 year-1 ) were observed in normal subjects. 7/8 DAT patients showed fCSF values above the age-adjusted normal range, while fGM and fW M values were significantly reduced in 5/8 and 6/8 patients. Average changes in the DAT group were: +104.8 fo r fCSF, -1 7 .9 % fo r fW M and -1 4 .0 % fGM. Conclusion: Brain atrophy can be quantitatively assessed in patients with DAT using a multispectral relaxometric segm entation approach. Purpose: To document the spectrum of MRI abnorm alities in patients after closed head trauma. Materials and Methods: MRI findings were recorded in 50 patients after craniocerebral traum a (37 men; 13 women; age range: 15 -68 years). MRI was performed between 3 months and 14 years after trauma. Standard MR examinations of the brain a t 1.5 T were supplem ented with dual echo GRE images. In selected patients, additional MR imaging was performed at 0.2 T, with a GRE sequence with a \u0422\u0415 o f 80 ms. Comparison was made with CT scans. Results: Common MRI findings after closed head injury included: diffuse axonal injury (DAI) lesions (n = 34), cortical brain contusions (21 patients), gliosis (n = 17), hydrocephalus (n = 8), atrophy (n = 26). FLASH images were more sensitive in showing punctate hemosiderin deposits, revealing 64% (\u0422\u0415 = 15 ms) to 82% (\u0422\u0415 = 35 ms) more DAI lesions than corresponding TSE images. DAI lesions occurred at the cerebral cortico-m edullary junction (n = 34), corpus callosum (n = 8), dorsolateral brainstem (n = 3).

The aim of this study was to investigate how much the effective dose to the child could be reduced when adding Cu filter in the beam fo r a colon examination performed at 102 kV and if this dose reduction could be achieved without endangering the image quality needed for accurate diagnosis. Organ doses to an anthropomorphic phantom simulating a 1 year old child was measured using TLD for assessment of the effective dose and this value was compared to the energy imparted obtained from kerm a-area product m easure ments. Since it is most probably low contrast objects that will be affected by an increase in X-ray energy, the image quality w as evaluated with phantoms containing low contrast objects, one of them filled with iodine contrast medium fo r measurements of signal-to-noise ratio. A clinical evaluation including 15 patients was performed by using the added filtration for one exposure fo r com parison with the image quality of the same projection without added filtration. This com parison was done by visual grading. Effective dose for a com plete examination can be decreased 44% fo r a male and 41 % for a female child and the reduction in energy im parted is 77% .

W e discuss the size range which would enable us to evaluate mediastinal lymph node involvement as either normal or pathologic. The aim of this study was to dem onstrate the spectrum of morpho logic and functional pulmonary abnorm alities in children surviving BPD. Materials and Methods: 12 survivors of BPD (8 m, 4 f; mean age 5.2 y) and 12 age matched controls were examined with chest X-ray (CX) and HRCT. Two radiologists analyzed CX and HRCT findings. Radiological changes were correlated with pulm onary function tests. Tests fo r each patient were com pleted within one week. In one case, radiological changes were compared to histological findings. Results: C X showed flattening of the diaphragm (n = 9), hyperexpansion (n = 8 ), hyperlucent areas (n = 8), linear opacities (n = 8 ) and atelectases (n = 3). Changes were equally distributed over both lungs. Bronchiectasis and cardiomegaly were not seen on CX. 4 BPD patients and the age matched control group had normal CX. 10/12 BPD patients had abnorm al findings at HRCT such as triangular subpleural opacities (n = 10), hypoattenuated areas (n = 9), linear opacities (n = 7), atelectasis (n = 3), pleural thickening (n = 2) and bronchiectasis (n = 1). In general, HRCT findings were equally distributed over both lungs, only linear opacities were seen more often on the left lung. Abnormal findings at HRCT correlated well with decreases in FEV1, MEF50, MEF25, TGV% TLC, RV%TLC. Neither parenchymal abnormalities nor pulm onary dysfunctions were seen in the normal control group. Conclusion: Most children who had BPD in infancy have sequelae seen on CX and HRCT, and abnorm al pulm onary function tests. Late pulmonary findings of BPD are better visualized on H R C T than on CX. These findings could reflect obstructive emphysem a due to small-airway obstruction with altered ventilation as well as areas of fibrosis and atelectasis. Glenn shunt or Fontan procedure may be associated with abnorm al pulmonary blood flow patterns and the developm ent o f pulm onary arteriovenous fistulae. Methods: This study assessed the pulm onary and total body blood flow utiliz ing the microsphere technique by sequential injection of Tc-99m microspheres into an upper and lower limb vein and performing conventional lung imaging in 4 projections and anterior and posterior total body scans in 47 patients with either Glenn shunt and/or Fontan procedure. The right-to-left shunt volume was quantitated by calculating a brain + kidneys/lungs ratio and com pared to values additionally calculated from the total body scans. Results: In 31/47 patients the blood from the superior vena cava w as pref erentially drained into the right lung (range 70 to 84%). The inferior venous system was distributed equally between both lungs. The mean right-to-leftshunt-volume was 23.9% when injected into the upper vein system and 46.8% when applied into the lower vein system. Conclusion: Lung perfusion scintigraphy is of great assistance to detect abnormal pulm onary blood flow patterns and to assess right-to-left-shuntvolume in children after Glenn o r Fontan procedure. Results: indications included mediastinal mass, airway stenosis, congenital anomalies and search fo r pulm onary metastases. Most frequent findings were benign thymic enlargement (n = 26), neurogenic tum ors (n = 6 ), atelectasis (n = 8), inflammatory changes (n = 9), tracheo-bronchial stenosis (n = 10) and thoracic anomalies (n = 12).

Rapid acquisition allows fo r excellent delineation of vascular structures and airways. Due to the reduction of motion-artefacts and the good quality o f multiplanar renderings, the diagnostic value was sufficient even in problem atic cases. The easier performance and availability of helical CT to MRI may make it the modality of choice in the diagnostic workup of thoracic disorders in the youngest age group. Material and Methods: PION as example for small particle size (37 nm) and DDM128 as exam ple fo r large particle size (80 nm) both reticuloendothelial system -directed agents, were com pared fo r liver enhancement in an experi mental model o f radiation-induced liver injury. A single x-irradiation exposure varied from 1 0 -6 0 Gy w as delivered to one side of the liver in 39 rats. T2w eighted spin-echo MR imaging was performed 3 days after x-irradiation at 30 minutes post-contrast. Results: Using the RES-directed PION, the normal, non-irradiated portion of the liver decreased in signal intensity with a maximum negative enhancement o f -66%, while the irradiated portion o f the liver decreased in signal intensity by -2 4 % . Signal intensity decline of irradiated liver tissue using PION was dose dependent, being more pronounced with lower radiation exposure. The difference in signal intensity between irradiated and non-irradiated portions w as also statistically different using DDM128 at 60 Gy (p < 0.05). At lower doses the difference in signal intensity between irradiated and non-irradiated portions w as not statistically different. Conclusion: Sensitivity of liver enhancement with RES-directed agents is size dependent. The sm aller particle (PION) is more sensitive fo r the detection of radiation-induced hepatitis than the larger particle (DDM128). The relative in sensitivity of DDM128 enhancem ent for diffuse liver injury maybe clinically ad vantageous fo r detecting focal lesions in the presence o f diffuse hepatic injury. Material and Methods: PION, a reticuloendothelial system-directed agent, and PION-ASF, a hepatocellular-directed agent, were com pared for time dependent liver enhancem ent in an experimental model of radiation-induced liver injury. Results: Using the RES-directed PION, the normal, non-irradiated portion of the liver decreased in signal intensity with a mean negative enhancement of -6 6 %, w hile the irradiated portion (60 Gy three days before imaging) of the liver decreased in signal intensity by -2 4 % , significantly less (p < 0.05). Signal intensity changes in irradiated liver tissue using PION were dose dependent, being more pronounced with lower radiation exposure. The difference in signal intensity changes induced by PION-ASF between irradiated and non-irradiated liver were not statistically different, but signal intensity decreased with a mean negative enhancem ent o f -8 0 % . Conclusion: Liver enhancement with the RES-directed PION is more sensitive fo r the detection of radiation-induced hepatitis than hepatocyte-directed PION-ASF. The insensitivity of PION-ASF enhancement fo r diffuse liver injury may be clinically advantageous fo r detecting focal lesions in the presence of diffuse hepatic injury. Methods: N -ethyl-N-nitrosurea, a potent carcinogen, was administered to 30 Sprague Dawley rats, inducing breast tum ors of varying pathology, benign through highly malignant. Pre-and dynamic post-contrast 3D-SPGR imaging was performed with Gd-DTPA (0.1 mmol Gd/kg) and again with Albumin-[Gd-DTPAjao (0.03 mmol Gd/kg) at a 24 hour interval. Using a two-compartment, bi-directional kinetic model permeability surface area products (PS) were calculated fo r each tum or and each contrast agent. PS values were correlated with histopathology. Results: Using the macromolecular contrast medium the tum or capillary permeabilities (PS) were significantly lower in benign than in malignant breast tum ors. No correlation between calculated PS and tum or grade was observed using Gd-DTPA. Conclusion: Breast tum or histologic grade is better defined with macromolec ular contrast medium enhancement than with Gd-DTPA. Tum or permeability, estimated by MRI, may permit clinical grading of breast tum ors and improved diagnostic specificity. To develop a gadolinium chelate fo r MR Angiography that does not quickly extravasate but is subject to fast elimination. Methods and Materials: A polym eric cascade type com plex (Gadomer-17) with an apparent molecular weight o f 30 kDa was synthesized and used fo r further studies as an aqueous form ulation (0.5 mol/l). The relaxivity was determ ined in water and plasm a at 0.47 T (Minispec, Bruker). The tissue distribution and excretion after intravenous injection of 0.1 mmol/kg was quantified in rats. The intravenous acute tolerance (LD 50) was studied in the same species. Imaging was performed in rats and rabbits at 2 T (SISCO) and at 1.5 T (M agnetom Vision) with standard fast 3D MRA techniques. Results: Gadom er-17 displays a T , relaxivity of 17.3 and 18.7 L m m o h ' s -1 in water and plasma, respectively. In the first minutes after injection the agent distributes exclusively in the blood space without significant diffusion into the extravascular space. Thereafter, a fast renal elimination o f the non-metabolized polym er takes place. Within 24 hours the m ajority o f the agent leaves the or ganism without significant retention in tissue. Much better angiograms (higher S/N, practically no enhancement of the parenchyma) at doses three to six tim es low er than GdDTPA are obtained. The arterial phase is clearly displayed during the first pass without venous overlap.",

H e n n e q u in ', J.L. L e ro y1, J.M. A ntoin e2, H. M orris2, P. B uno uf2; 1 Lille/F, 2 Paris/F Purpose: To compare the efficacy of I nf oson hysterosalpingo-sonography (HSS) to saline HSS both in relation to X-ray hysterosalpingography (HSG) in determining correctly fallopian tube patency. Methods and Materials: 23 patients (mean age 33.3 years), referred fo r hypofertility evaluation with HSG, underwent \u0412 mode (n-23) ultasonography with Saline (n = 12) o r Infoson (n = 11) intra-uterine injection after randomization. Patency criteria was contrast flow com ing from the tube into the peritoneal cavity in the ovarian vicinity. Saline (7 ml/injection) and Infoson (2 -4 ml + 1-5 ml Saline) injection was performed through balloon catheter (Ackrad 5F). HSG was performed for all patients after ultrasound at the same delay and con sidered as the reference method. To com pare the ability to correctly classify the tubal patency between the 2 groups, a sequential stastistical analysis was used. Methods and Materials: 9 patients with clinical and ultrasonographic suspi cion of adnexal mass were submitted to MRI examination of the pelvis. 0.5 T superconductive unit with body coil and SE T 1-weighted -before and after i.v. administration of Gadolinium-DTPA in 7/9 patients-and FSE T2-weighted sequences on the three spatial planes were performed. Surgical proof was obtained in all cases. Results: In 4/9 the abscess was bilateral, in 5/9 unilateral; 2/9 had used IUD; regular edges of the adnexal mass were present in all cases as well as parietal convolution; air-fluid level was observed in 1 case and fluid-fluid level in 2/9; linear strands in the peritoneum were present in 9/9; ascites in 3/9; in no patient lymphadenopathy was encountered. MRI allowed a correct diagnosis o f tubo-ovarian abscess in 9/9 patients. Conclusion: MRI thanks to multiplanarity that allow s to recognize the detour of the tubes and em ploym ent o f contrast media that allowed to exclude the presence of solid vascularized masses proved to be an useful tool in establishing the diagnosis of tubo-ovarian abscess that can be misleading for the aspecific symptoms at presentation.",

Long term follow-up (6 months) was performed in 5 patients. T2W and T1W images, before and after Gd-DTPA i.v. administration (dynamic study), were acquired in all patients. Hystologic proof of cryol\u00e9sions was available in three cases. MR images were quali tatively evaluated. Appearances of the treated lesions were described (size, morphology, and signal intensity). Results: Fifty-one lesions were hyperintense just after treatm ent on T1W images while 6 were hypointense. Follow-up examination at 1 -2 months showed isointensity with liver parenchyma on T1W images in 35 lesions. Follow-up examinations at 6 months showed shrinkage (reduction in size and in conspicuity) o f those lesions which were hyperintense on T1W images at first control. Recurrence of tum ors w as demonstrated in one of the three lesions which were hypointense at first control after treatment. M aterials and Methods: 20 patients underwent 24 atherectom y procedures to anastom otic stenoses. There were 15 PTFE, 4 Dacron, and one com posite graft; these were sited both above and below the inguinal ligament. 12 (57.1%) of 21 grafts were occluded at presentation and required throm bectom y or thrombolysis before atherectomy. Atherectom y was perform ed percutaneously in all but 4 patients who had surgical cut down onto a graft under local anaesthetic. Average follow up was 12.9 months (range < 1 to 40 months). Follow up was by duplex graft surveillance and angiography if necessary. Results: Technical success: 19 of 22 (86% ) showed < 30% residual stenosis post procedure. Complications: There were 4 puncture site haematomas, 3 required surgical treatment; in one case contrast extravasated a t the site of atherectomy, this did not require surgical treatm ent and the graft w as patent at 22 month follow up. Follow up: At 16 atherectomy sites there was no evidence of significant restenosis, of these: 12 grafts remain patent; 1 patient (two atherectom y sites) died following myocardial infarction with a patent but failing graft; 2 occluded due to progressive outflow disease. 1 patient had atherectom y repeated due to residual stenosis at follow up duplex imaging. 3 others have occluded but it was not clear if recurrence of NIH was to blame. 4 grafts failed despite technically successful atherectomy in patients with grafts occluded at presentation and successfully reopened by lysis. Graft occlusion occurred alm ost immediately post atherectomy: 2 patients underwent above knee am putation, one died of complications. The other patient (two atherectom y sites) had a successful surgical revascularisation and the limb was salvaged.

Method: The Y20 2S:Eu, Y V O^E u , and Y20 3:Eu phosphor m aterials were used to prepare test screens in laboratory employing the sedim entation method. Screens were excited by X-rays at various tube voltages and their efficiency (intensity o f light emission over exposure rate) was measured with a photom ultiplier-electrom eter system and a dosimeter. The light spectrum was also measured with an Oriel monochromator. Finally, the spectral com patibility with the Si photodiode and the num ber o f electrons generated per X-ray absorbed were calculated using appropriate m athem atical formulas. Results: Y20 2S:Eu screens were found most efficient while Y 20 3:Eu screens were better than Y V 0 4:Eu. The spectral com patibility with the Si photodiode w as found equal to about 0.7 fo r all phosphors, w hich is better than the corresponding values o f terbium activated phosphors. The num ber of electrons per X-ray is adequately high at a range o f X-ray energies from 20 to 50 keV, which is very interesting fo r medical radiography. Conclusion: Detectors from europium activated yttrium com pounds are e f ficient and well matched to the sensitivity of Si photodiodes used in digital radiography and C T systems.",

The observation of linear microcalcifications for example in cranio-caudal direction, i.e. across lobules, make the observation less likely to represent a malignant area since the pathways of the ducts generally do not interconnect lobules.

At present, the most reliable diagnostic features remain those obtained from the stenotic site. However, these features requires experienced hands in order to accurately interrogate extrarenai arteries. Intrarenal Doppler waveform alterations which can be obtained in nearly all patients, have been used in order to indirectly diagnose RAS and to provide a functional assessment of RAS. Aside from classic tardus parvus patterns, downstream repercussions of significant RAS have been quantified through various criteria which will be discussed. The CDUS-based strategy which we apply fo r the screening of patients sus pected of RVH will be described and validated in term s of cost-effectiveness. This strategy can allow significant cost savings over a screening method relying primarily on arteriography.",

It provides accurate detection o f significant renal artery stenoses and additional information on mural calcifications. \u0421\u0422\u0410 is limited by a low cranio-caudal coverage, the need for iodinated contrast media, and the lack of ability to quantify blood flow in renal vessels. The phase-contrast (PC) technique is recommended for unenhanced MR angiography of renal arteries. The directional com ponent of the phase images permit easy differentiation of arteries from veins, thus eliminating a potential source of error. Morphologic assessment of the renal arteries with PC-MRA is, however, still handicapped by the inability to adequately visualize distal renal artery segments and small accessory vessels. W hile the accepted gold standard, conventional angiography, is highly sensitive in the detection of renovascular disease, it is merely 5 0 -8 0 % specific. CINE-PC based functional blood flow analysis, capable of expressing renal flow, may overcome some of these limitations. A breathheld PC-imaging strategy is essential fo r accurate blood flow quantification. Contrast-enhanced 3D MR acquisition techniques proved to be highly accurate RC for visualization of renal vessels. In its initial implementation imaging times ranged from 3 to 5 minutes. The use o f fast gradient system s allow s to reduce imaging times and to perform breath-hold data acquisition. High resolution images of main and segmental arterial branches can be obtained after injection of higher doses of paramagnetic contrast media. A virtual angioscopic display of the acquired images provides a new insight into m orphologic alterations of renal arteries.

Examples will be given based on the experiences with a RIS currently in use in 37 hospitals in the Netherlands. One important facet is the communication with other departm ents in the hospital. This is essential to allow fo r i.a. the tuning of patient appointm ents with other hospital visits, decentralized order entry, automatic importing of patient data into radiology reports, and immediate availability o f results to the requester. Another im portant aspect is the com m unication of the RIS with digital modalities and FACS.

In order to decrease the recurrence and com plication rates partially induced by the angioplasty's mechanism, that is plaque fracture with intimai and/or medial dissection, different devices have been developed. Techniques such as laser, atherectom y devices, covered and non-covered stents and fibrinolytic agents have been developed trying to improve the long term patency rate. Unfortunately none of these techniques is a real alternative to angioplasty. Debulking with laser o r atherectom y devices was used to increase the vascular diam eter while minimizing the angioplasty effects, however, the long term patency was not better than that of angioplasty alone. Because of the technical limitations and the high cost, their use has been reduced dramatically over the past years. The use of vascular stents has significantly improved the long term patency rates of revascularization techniques. Recent publications advocate primary stenting as a more cost-effective method than angioplasty alone. However, the com bination of stent and PTA seems to be the best approach at the present time.",

Approaches to register multiple images are divided into extrinsic methods based on artificial markers, and intrinsic matching methods based solely on the patient image data.

Meiners; Utrecht/NL Multimodal matching refers to matching of different imaging techniques, which provide com plem entary information. Clinical fields in which multimodality dis plays may be useful are neurosurgery and radiotherapy. Advantages and disadvantages will be discussed using examples in practice. Advantages of m ultimodal im aging and fusion are: 1. Obviating limitations and artifacts of one technique by fusion with another technique: Example 1) Coricai bone disruption by a skull base tumour, better appreciated on CT than on MRI: furtherm ore the bony landmarks on C T correlates better with the intra-operative visualisation o f these structures: the soft tissue com ponent of the tum our however m ay be better visualized by MRI. Example 2) Implanted subdural electrodes are readily segmented on postoperative CT scans. On MRI however the hypointense artifacts associated with the metal cause difficulties in segmentation using this technique. Example 3) In radiotherapy, fusion of CT and MRI may be useful in radiation doses-calculation on CT (electron density determ ines radiation absorption) in tumours. MRI is used for volume demarcation of tum our and fo r exclusion of normal surrounding tissues. 2. Complementary information provided by tw o different imaging modalities: Example 1) 3D MRI structural visualisation of the brain combined with images of glucose metabolism using 18FDG PET or com bined with blood flow images using HMPAO SPECT scans.

Frouge; Le Krem lin-Bic\u00eatre/F MRI after injection of Gadolinium have demonstrated a good sensivity in detecting breast carcinoma partially related to the enhancement of intraductal carcinoma. The major problem o f breast MRI, is its a lack of specificity since some benign lesion like fibroadenom as and epithelial hyperplasia also presents a signal enhancem ent after Gadolinium injection. MRI have from now on, obvious indications such as post operative, irradiated or augm ented breast but the other indications to determ ine precisely the place o f this examination, due to his cost and the good diagnostic perform ance of the association of clinical examination, mammography and sonography com pleted by cytoponctions o r microbiopsies under sonographic or stereotaxic guidance. In this part o f the course, we will first study the com plex mechanism s o f tumoral enhancement after Gadolinium injection with a special attention to intraductal carcinoma. In a second part, we will try to define the perspectives of breast MRI fo r the years to com e in two different clinical situations: detection of a focal lesion and characterization of a lesion previously described by another modality. plays presently a basic role in characterizing pancreatic tumors; nevertheless, the ongoing evolution of the different Imaging modalities as well as the most recent acquisitions on the pathology o f some pancreatic tum ors allow presently not only to differentiate ductal carcinom a vs. the other pancreatic neoplasms, but also to characterize in a noninvasive way the various tumors, even the rarer ones. Among the cystic tum ors a few patterns have been identified, which allow to differentiate peripheral m ucinous cystic tum ors from both serous cystadenoma and papillary cystic tumor. A significant diagnostic improvement has been achieved especially in the identification of intraductal mucin-producing tumors, which were in the past either underestim ated (wrong diagnosis of obstructive chronic pancreatitis) or mixed up with other tum ors (peripheral cystic tumors). Also among the rare solid tum ors of the pancreas (nonfunctioning islet cell tum ors; acinar carcinoma; lymphoma; metastasis; etc.) it is possible to identify some patterns which allow these lesions to be differentiated from the ductal carcinoma. This report emphasizes the contribution of the different Imaging modalities -notably US, CT, MR, Angiography and ERCP -to the correct characterization of these tum ors as well as the possible pitfalls. In the adult solid renal masses are detected because of an alteration in the renal contour, a distortion of the collecting system o r an abnorm ality in the density/echogenicity of the mass com pared to normal parenchyma. Once a solid mass is detected it is helpful to evaluate its patterns of growth: expansion (ball) o r interstitial infiltration (bean). Expansive masses (ball growth) are characterized by focal distortion of the renal contour, sharp margination with norm al parenchym a and focal displace ment of the collecting system. In the adult the most common solid balls include renal cell carcinoma, oncocytoma, angiom yolipom a and metastases. Infiltrating masses (bean growth) are characterized by an ill-defined margin, encasement o f the collecting system and focal or diffuse enlargem ent of the renal contour. The most common beans include lymphoma, invasive transi tional cell carcinom a and metastatic disease. This course will em phasize these tw o growth patterns as well as the differential features o f solid renal tumors. Renal cystic masses com prises a mixed group of heritable, developm ent, and acquired disorders. An awareness of the pathology of each cystic disease is helpful in the understanding of the corresponding images from the simple cyst to the cyst with malignant tissue in the wall. Meticulous attention to subtle radiologic findings is, therefore, essential for reaching a correct diagnosis as well as the findings should always be carefully correlated with the clinical features. The diagnostic m anagem ent should clarify w hether heparin treatm ent started at the first clinical suspicion of PE should be terminated, continued or extended to more aggressive therapy. If severe PE is clinically suspected bedside echocardiography helps in quick decision-making by assessing RV overload and imaging right heart andwith esophageal probes -central pulm onary arterial thrombi. Absence of echocardiographic signs of RV pressure overload makes attem pts at throm bolytic/surgical embolectomy unjustified. When milder form s of PE are sus pected perfusion lung scan should be checked against ventilation scan or chest X-ray fo r mismatching. Unfortunately, the majority of scans are abnor mal but inconclusive. Contrast enhanced spiral C T is likely to replace lung scan as a first-choice test fo r suspected PE. Isolated subsegmentai emboli missed by this highly specific method are of questionable clinical significance in the absence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). In cases without clear con firmation of PE and with preserved cardio-respiratory resen/e serial negative compression ultrasound testing fo r proximal DVT justifies withholding o f an tithrombotic treatment. MRI venography could be combined with search for pulmonary thrombi, if not fo r relatively low specificity fo r the latter. Thus, pulmonary angiography remains the golden standard fo r PE, but is being challenged by non-invasive and cost-effective imaging methods capable both to directly visualize pulm onary emboli and provide alternative diagnoses. ance (MR and CT, plain and with contrast), and anatom ic location help to tentatively identify the tum or's nature. Conclusion: MR imaging, carefully performed, has become the prim ary inves tigative tool for the diagnosis and follow up (effects of treatm ent, recurrences) of brain tum ors in children. The mode o f inoculation in infancy and childhood is predominantly hematoge nous and, in many instances, the origin remains unknown. C ertain aspects of pediatric osteomyelitis pose unique diagnostic challenges. Imaging techniques, including conventional radiographs, scintigraphy, sonog raphy, C T and MR m ay all play a role at the time o f diagnosis. Plain radiographs and scintigraphy should be considered mandatory in the diagnostic approach to suspected bone infection. Sonography and C olor or Power D oppler if available can be helpful in depicting subperiosteal collections and neighbouring soft-tissue involvement. CT allow s accurate visualization of cortical bone involvement. MR gives essential information about the extent of the lesion and allows presurgical mapping.",

The total num ber of MRI installations world-wide is estimated to be well over 10000. The United States is the m arket leader with some 4000 installations, out of w hich about 2/3 are high field devices (1.0 T o r higher). Although 1.5 T continues to be the most popular choice, the largest growth segment in recent years has been in the 1.0 T market, which has surpassed the 0.5 T mid-field in popularity. This is attributed to its advantageous com prom ise between the clinical and marketing requirements o f high field and the cost-effectiveness of mid-field systems. The m arket share of low field (under 0.5 T) systems used to be relatively low. In 1992 the num ber of 0.5 T installations was more than twice that o f low field systems, while in 1995 the num ber of sold low field units was almost equal to that of 0.5 T units, mainly due to rapid fall in the mid-field installations. In 1994, 85 out of 339 sold system s (25%) in the US were less than 0.5 T (1). Out of these 55 were under 0.21 T systems. In Europe and Japan the share o f low field devices is higher. The num ber of annual new installations continues to increase in Europe, while in Japan the number of new MRI installation orders has levelled off. The original idea of producing low or even ultra-low field (< 0.1 T) MRI devices was to avoid the high cost of high field MRI equipment. There was also some scientific evidence which favoured low field. Although the sensitivity of the very low field imagers w as proven to be quite satisfactory fo r most diagnoses, the very lowest field strengths (200 and 400 gauss) were replaced by somewhat higher fields due to dissatisfied response o f the medical community -even if the images were clearly sharper than any state-of-the-art nuclear medicine equipment can produce. Altogether only about 200 installations in the range of 0 .0 2-0 .064 T were ever delivered, if one excludes the unknown number (70?) of Chinese illegal copies o f one o f these devices.",

(4) Governmental regulation. The radiologist making the choice sees the pur chase as a one tim e opportunity. Therefore he selects the most expensive and visible unit, since he may not have a second chance in a country with strong governmental control. (5) Reimbursement policy. In some countries reimbursement levels are set according to field strength in such a w ay that it is actually more profitable to the service provider and to the patient to have the examination done at high field. The cost savings in low field MRI are obvious. The investment cost of a low field MRI system is 50% o r less than the cost of a state-of-the-art 1.5 T system. Running costs of a non-superconductive low field system show even greater difference in favour o f the low field. Site preparation and personnel costs may be close to equal. Patient throughput in modern high field system s may be up to 50%, but not 100% higher than in low field systems. For low field MRI to perform well, high technology is necessary in low field MRI even more than in high field. Therefore the relative price of low field MRI has not decreased as much as high o r middle field during the past tw o years. As long as there is an unlimited demand fo r MRI examinations despite their high cost, it appears to be financially profitable to run a high field system. Should the demand fo r MRI be saturated in a given community, low field systems cause less financial pressure to the reimbursement organisation and to the service provider, should the medical com munity accept low field as an accepted modality. As a com parison, X-rays of a broken ankle or wrist are accepted even if they are not produced with the most up-to-date, high performance, remote controlled, digital, multi-angle equipment. Low field MRI provides sufficient diagnostic information using spin echo and gradient echo techniques. The fast spin echo and steady state techniques reduce the acquisition time and separate w ater and fat images can be re constructed with gradient echo sequence. Optim um design of closely coupled RF-coils is im portant in increasing the signal-to-noise. Low band width tech nology and long TE gradient echoes are additional techniques to improve the performance of low field systems. Low RF absorption enables the use of special in vivo magnetisation transfer and spin lock techniques. Recently introduced open m agnets offer com pletely new dim ensions to low field MRI. Body applications o f low field MRI enjoy low er sensitivity to vascular, respiratory and peristaltic motion as com pared with high field units. Easier use of life support devices are in favour o f low field imaging. The interventional and functional applications o f MRI have been developing slower than anticipated. This may be partly due to industry's lacking interest in developing new applications until now. Dedicated extrem ity imaging devices seem to have market among certain clinical specialities (outside hospital-based radiology). Interventional applications are more hospital-oriented and appear to develop slower. The recent pressure on cost containment, developm ent of interventional tech niques, use of MR system s in intensive care and operating suites, deployment of magnets in office suites and developm ent o f new magnet configurations all favour the use of low field systems. It is up to the medical com munity to decide if highest available image quality and cost is always required or not. Magnet design is the key issue fo r open MRI systems. Iron core magnets typ ically utilize perm anent or resistive technology but superconducting solutions have also been introduced. These magnets feature a horizontal gap rather than a bore. Air-core superconducting m agnet with vertical gap is another approach. Interventional MRI is the area where open MR is expected to have largest impact. IMRI sets several requirements fo r the scanner and its accessories. These may include MR compatible patient monitoring, special patient coach, navigation systems, fast imaging techniques etc. It is evident that open MR imagers will have a m ajor impact in MR imaging. New applications may be the driving force, but due to the improved patient comfort, and the ease of patient positioning and monitoring make these magnets attractive also for routine MR scanning.",

Beside the transversal CT-images we used planar and 3-D reconstructions for evaluation.

There was no significant density uptake nor in the sceletal muscle neither in the myocardium. In another nine patients there was a high density uptake in the muscle transplant after superselective intraarterial contrast injection. In tw o patients small vascular connections from the sceletal muscle to the myocardium could be found as well as a little density uptake in the myocardium.

Number, size, location, and con spicuity of the lesions, were evaluated by two independent observers. Contrast ratios (CR) between lesions and normal brain/CSF, as well as contrast to noise ratios (CNR) were calculated. Results: FLAIR is found to be significantly superior to T2-TSE in detection of small lesions, and lesions located in cortical/subcortical regions and deep white matter. To evaluate fast fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) tech nique fo r imaging intraaxial brain tum ors and to com pare this method with conventional T2-and PD-weighted turbo spin echo. Patients and Methods: Twenty patients with intraaxial brain tum ors were studied with MRI, including turbo-Flair and conventional T2-and proton density (PD)-weighted turbo spin echo. Four quantitative and three qualitative criteria were used. The quantitative criteria were lesion to white matter contrast, lesion to white matter contrast to noise, lesion to CSF contrast and lesion to CSF contrast to noise. The qualitative criteria were lesion conspicuity, lesion detectability and image artifact, evaluated in a multireader analysis. Results: Turbo-FLAIR images had a significantly higher lesion to white-matter contrast and a significantly better lesion to CSF contrast com pared to T2 and PD images. The lesion conspicuity was in 80% o f the patients better with FLAIR than with T2 o r PD images. In 5 patients FLAIR images provided better definition between edem a and tumor. In another tw o patients additional lesion could be detected. Image artifacts were present in 60% o f the FLAIR images, but image interpretation w as disturbed in one patient only (5%). Conclusion: Turbo FLAIR is superior to proton density and T2 weighted im ages in the detection and delineation of intraaxial brain tumors. The sequence should be included into the image protocol in the diagnosis and management of intraaxial brain tumors.",

Kassai; Tokyo/J Purpose: To assess the usefulness o f MR cisternography using a three-dim en sional (3D) half-Fourier single-shot fast spin-echo (FastASE; fast advanced spin-echo) sequence in dem onstrating the cranial nerves. Methods and Materials: W e evaluated MR cisternogram s obtained using the 3D FastASE sequence in 5 volunteers (4 men and 1 woman; age range, 2 5 -3 6 years) and in 13 patients (5 men and 13 women; age range, 2 0 -7 9 years). The MR cisternograms were obtained on a 0. Material and Methods: Hippocampal and brain volum es were measured com puterized in 50 children (1 month to 15 years, mean: 5.7 years) without epilepsy, using a spoiled FLASH 3D (slice thickness: 0 .9 -1 .7 mm) and T2 weighted sequence. Data analysis included inter-and intraobserver variability as well as calculation of the coefficient of error. Hippocampal volum e was normalized to a total brain volume of 1000 cm3. Results: Intraobserver variability was 1.4% and interobserver variability 3.2%. A significant mean difference in volum e (p < 0.0001) does exist between the right and left hippocampus, with the right being larger by 0.14 cm3. In children older than five years, hippocampal volum e correlated with total brain volume with a regression coefficient o f 0.81. Normalized hippocam pal volume revealed a mean value of 1.7 cm3 and a standard deviation of 0.13 cm 3 Under five years, ratio between hippocampal and brain volum e follow s a non linear function. In eight patients with histologically confirm ed carcinoma of the urinary bladder and one patient with chronic cystitis, a helical C T scan with double detector technology was carried out pre-operatively. A native scan was first performed, followed by an examination in the early contrast medium enhanced phase. After adequate contrasting of the urinary bladder (30 minutes latency), further images were acquired. These data were transferred to a separate graphic com puter workstation and reconstructed. The results were then compared with the cystoscopic and pathohistologic findings. Results: All tum ors of the urinary bladder identified at fiberoptic cystoscopy were also visualized with virtual cystoscopy. The best reconstruction results were obtained from data acquired after the 30-m inute latency period. The rhabdosphincter o f the male urethra is an omega-shaped loop of striated muscle fibers that surrounds the membranous urethra at its lateral and anterior aspects. In a com bined anatom ic-sonographic study we wanted to define sonom orphologic criteria of this muscle. Methods and Materials: After sonographic examination histological sections w ere com pared to the images obtained by m eans of three-dimensional transrectal and transurethral ultrasound in 7 anatomical specimens. Then, in a total of 52 patients the rhabdosphincter o f the male urethra was investi gated by m eans of these new imaging techniques and urodynamics. 40 of these patients were fully continent after radical prostatectomy and served as control group; 12 patients presented with urinary stress incontinence after transurethral resection of the prostate o r radical prostatectomy.",

At presentation all o f the men were more than 50 years old. The sonography was performed with a 7.5 Mhz frequency linear probe. Results: Ectasia of the rete testis was unilateral in 9 and bilateral in 8 patients. It was always localized in the mediastinum testis and was associated to spermatocele in 7 cases and to testicular cysts in 5. On sonogram s the lesion showed numerous tubular or rounded anechoic structures, mimicking a hypoechoic mass. In five men with sonographic follow-up of 6-21 months there has been observed no change in size and structure of the testicular lesion. Conclusion: Tubular ectasia of rete testis shares several sonographic features with testicular cysts and spermatocele and probably they have the same mechanism o f formation. This benign condition can be distinguished from testicular tum ors or non neoplastic lesions on the basis of the sonographic findings and its recognition is im portant to avoid unnecessary surgery. Material and Methods: 7 patients (4 women, 3 men) aged 3 6 -7 6 year-old (m = 47) were referred because o f vomiting, nausea, and w eight loss due to stenosis of the duodenum (6) or the stomach (1).

Six patients w ere treated under nasogastric approach and one under percutaneous transgastric access. Results: All stents were deployed, but shortening of the stent in one patient during its complete expansion the day after the procedure led to placem ent of an additionnai stent. Four patients continue to have a normal food intake 1 -1 0 months after stent placement. Two patients need fractionated meals (stenose located on stmomach in one, and on first duodenum in the other).

To assess whether color Doppler US allows differential diagnosis between accessory spleens and autotransplanted splenic tissue. Methods and Materials: Ten consecutive normal subjects with accessory spleen and 15 postsplenectom y patients underwent color-Doppler-US. Scintig raphy (99mTc-sulphur colloid) w as performed in 9/15 postsplenectom y patients who underwent reimplantation of splenic tissue in an om ental pouch. The shape of accessory spleens and of autotransplanted tissue was assessed by measuring the largest longitudinal (L) and smallest transverse (T) diameters on the same US scan and by calculating the L/T ratio. Pulsed Doppler analysis was performed on every persistent color signal. Results: eleven implants and a focus of splenosis were detected in 7/9 postsplenectom y patients with reimplantation. Two hypertrophied accessory spleens were found in 2/6 postsplenectom y patients without reimplantation. Accessory spleens had smooth margins and L/T ratio close to 1 (1.15 \u00b1 0.09) whereas splenic implants were slightly lobulated and had a significantly higher (p < 0.001) U T ratio (1.85 \u00b1 0.44).

Material and Methods: 65 consecutive patients with an audiologically con firmed unilateral sensorineural hearing loss were included in the study. MRexaminations were performed on a 0.5 T scanner. First the patients underwent Axial SE PD T2-W and sagittal SE T1W images of the whole brain in order to exclude retrocochlear lesions. SE T1W axial and coronal images of the petrous bones were obtained before and after administration of GD-DTPA Results: The most common finding was multiple high-signal intensity lesions located in the white matter of the brain, found in 8 patients.

An excellent correlation was found between the radiological and surgical results of the insertion depth (r = 0.98). A significant difference of auditory performance w as found between patients with an insertion of 21 mm or less and those with a deeper insertion (p < 0.006). Conclusion: Digital radiographs in the modified Stenver's projection allow a reliable postoperative assessment of the Combi 40 device and an exact evaluation o f the insertion depth. Patients with deeply inserted electrodes showed a significantly better auditory performance than those with a lesser deep insertion. Beside photon absorption coherent and incoherent object scatter are the major attenuation com ponents of X-rays transmitted through an object slice. Scattered photons reaching the detector array increase the detected signal and produce image artifacts as \"cupping\" effects in large objects and dark bands between high attenuating regions. The artifact am plitudes increase with scanned volume or slice width. Object scatter can be reduced significantly in 3rd generation CT systems by collimating the detector elem ents but a correction can still improve image quality. For 4th generation geometry only poor collimation is possible and a numeric correction necessary. This paper presents a correction algorithm for 3rd and 4th generation CT geometry requiring low com putation effort which allows flexible application to different body regions by simple parameter adjustments. The calculation of object scatter intensity within the scanned projections is based on a convolution o f the weighted and windowed projection data with a spatially invariant \"blurring\" function. The scatter intensities are subtracted from the scanned intensity data. The \"blurring\" function is approxim ated from the angular shape of coherent and incoherent differential scatter cross sections and depends on the scanner's geometry and collimation. Several examples of phantom and medical objects scanned with 3rd and 4th generation CT system s are discussed. In 3rd generation scans scatter artifacts are efficiently corrected. More extensive scatter artifacts caused by less effective collimation are also compensated. For 4th generation geometry with poor collimation object scatter artifacts are significantly reduced.",

Conclusion: Taking into account lack o f statistically true differences on other C T signs and in normal X-ray picture (absence of \"contraction\"), C T doesn't present any com plem entary information and shouldn't be performed. CT signs as significant liming sizes, intensification of their density, presence of a definite regenerate \"contraction\" and its contour pressing are bad prognostic signs requiring correction in distraction. Methods and Materials: MR imaging of the wrist was performed in eight patients with tuberculous arthritis. Spin-echo images (T1-, T2-and protondensity weighted) were obtained in axial, sagittal and coronal planes. T1weighted axial images were obtained before and after the intravenous injection o f Gd-DTPA. All patient had a surgical biopsy and obtained histopathologic diagnosis. W e divided them into tw o groups of the patients as with diffuse (both the flexor and the extensor tendon group involved) and focal (one of the flexor or the extensor tendon group involved) involvement. Results: All patients presented with mass, and had pain and neurologic sym ptom s around wrist. Four out of five patients with nerve compression symptom had carpal tunnel syndrome. MRI showed diffuse (n = 5) and focal (n = 3) synovial hypertrophy. Four cases of the diffuse involvement had diffuse bone m arrow involvement. Four patients showed ring enhancement on post enhanced T 1 -w eighted images w hich turn out to be abscess. No joint fluid was seen in any o f the patients. Abscess wall w as well delineated with linear hom ogeneous high signal intensity of uniform thickness on post-contrast study. O ther findings were focal bone erosion (n = 3), joint space narrowing (n = 2) and subchondral bone destruction (n = 2) on MR images. Patients (n = 4) who had abscess (n = 4) treated with surgical debriment, other patients (n = 4) who had synovial hypertrophy with no abscess had medical treatment.",

Claussen; T\u00fcbingen/D Purpose: To test a newly designed device fo r exact MR-guided localization of breast lesions and to test a new marking technique using a non-displacable metal coil. Methods and Materials: The exam inations were performed on a 1.0 T im ager (Siemens, Erlangen/G), using a sagittally oriented oval spine coil. The MR compatible localization device which was constructed in our institution consisted of a perforated plate with 2 mm bore holes in 2 mm distance. The patient is examined in prone position. For localization o f lesions close to the thoracic wall the plate can be angulated. The plate contained an \" M\"-shaped tube filled with oil. This enabled exact localization of the lesion in relation to the bore holes. After needle placement (19.5 G, MR com patible, Cook, M\u00fcnchengladbach/G) through a bushing (BIP, T\u00fcrkenfeld/G), the marking coil (5 mm, Cook, M \u00fcnchengladbach/G) was placed through the needle next to or into the lesion. Then a suspension of charcoal, Gd-DTPA, and w ater was injected (1 ml). The protocol was approved by the local ethical committee. Suspicious lesions that could be visualized only by MR were preoperatively localized and marked in five patients. Specimen radiography w as performed. One patient could not be exam ined due to obesity. Results: The lesion size ranged from 0.5 to 3.5 cm (median 1.2 cm). The marking coils were exactly placed, w hereas the suspension showed a variable distribution. Three benign lesions (intraductal hyperplasia 2 x , radial scar 1 x ) and 2 malignant lesions (DCIS and ductal invasive cancer) were found. Angulation of the plate was beneficial in tw o cases. Conclusion: Using the newly designed add-on device, exact MR-guided localization of breast lesions is leasable, independent of their location in the breast. The construction of an additional MR coil is not necessary. The excision of the lesion is proven by the concom itant excision of the marking coil that cannot be displaced after its placement. Purpose: A breast biopsy device is needed for: 1) the necessary preoperative marking of MR-detected lesions fo r surgeons and pathologists; 2) percuta neous biopsy for minimal invasive differentiation of MR-detected indeterminate lesions.",

Allgayer; Erlangen/D Purpose: The keyhole method allows higher tem poral resolution by acquiring reduced \u043a -space data o f the post contrast images. The study aim w as to evaluate whether 3D-Keyhole imaging shows identical enhancem ent in breast lesions com pared to normal imaging. M aterials and Methods: Ten patients with 19 lesions were studied (1.5 T, Gyroscan ACS-II, Philips). A 3D-GRE-sequence w as performed before and S 243 4 tim es after bolus Gd-DTPA administration (0.2 mmol/kg). 50 coronal slices (2.5 mm, 256 x 225 matrix) were acquired and reconstructed. In an additional keyhole reconstruction the centre 40% of \u043a -space of the post contrast images was com bined with the outer part of \u043a-space of the pre contrast scan. Using identical ROI's, tim e-intensity curves of both reconstructions were compared. Results: Signal values of the tim e-intensity curves of 18 lesions (17 carcinoma, 1 fibroadenom a, max. diam eter 5.6 to 37.5 mm, mean 14.3 mm) differed less than 3.5%. One small lesion (a vessel, 2.5 mm) showed an 11% lower enhancem ent in the keyhole reconstruction. Conclusion: We demonstrated that all relevant lesions showed comparable enhancem ent without and with keyhole. The latter offers potential higher tem poral resolution. W e consider keyhole imaging to be the most appropriate method in breast MRI. The tem poral resolution w as 1 8 -3 0 seconds with continous scanning for 10 minutes. Dynam ic contrast-enhanced images were transferred to a Sun Sparc station and evaluated with color coding software. A color coding scala from blue to red was introduced according to enhancement percentage of tissues as a function of time with red regions indicating a rapid uptake of the contrast agent. C olor coded images were evaluated by using ROI analysis and time-intensity curves were obtained. Results: With color coding software, regions or lesions showing pathological contrast enhancem ent were identified easily and quantitatively. Malign lesions usually displayed focal red regions. W hile some of the benign lesions showed color values not different than normal breast tissues, some demonstrated more intense coloring than normal breast. Conclusion: Color coding, in dynam ic contrast-enhanced with no fat satura tion T1-weighted 2D FMSPGR sequences of whole breast with a reasonable temporal resolution, gives the advantage to dem onstrate pathologic contrast enhancement by obviating the observer variability associated with ROI analy sis. Patients and Methods: The study com prised 8 patients with gastric NHL (6 high-grade and 2 low-grade, one of the MALT type) and a control group of 7 patients (5 patients with NHL without clinical signs of gastric involvement, 1 patient with NHL and benign gastric ulcer and 1 patient with adenocarcinoma of the stomach). All patients with gastric NHL and the tw o with benign gastric ulcer and adenocarcinoma, respectively, underwent endoscopy including multiple biopsies fo r histopathological diagnosis. C T was performed in all patients except 3 from the control group, in whom magnetic resonance imaging was performed instead. Results: All patients with high-grade and one o f the tw o with low-grade NHL and the patient with adenocarcinoma displayed high gastric uptake of ,8FDG corresponding to the pathological findings at endoscopy and/or CT. No pathological tracer uptake w as seen in the patient with low-grade gastric NHL of the MALT type. In 6/8 patients with gastric NHL, ,8FDG PET demonstrated larger tum or extension in the stomach than was found at endoscopy, and there was high tracer uptake in the stomach in 2 patients who were evaluated as normal on CT. I8FDG PET correctly excluded gastric NH L (no focal pathological tracer uptake was found) in the patient with a benign gastric ulcer and in the patients with NHL without clinical signs o f gastric involvement. Conclusions: 18FDG PET provides novel possibilities fo r evaluation o f gastric NHL and would seem valuable as a com plement to endoscopy and CT in selected patients, where the technique may yield additional information decisive fo r the choice of therapy.",

Especially the topography of lesions to small anatom ical structures -as vessels and brain nerves -is significantly better seen in the MP-RAGE than in the conventional SE technique. Multiplanar reconstruction and dynam ic image analysis provide an enormous am ount of information fo r the operating neurosurgeon. Segmentation of the 3D data sets gives additional benefits. Data transfer makes this information available on workstations and guidance system s located in operating theatres. Patients and Methods: Ninety-four \u0130HA were studied in 87 children classed in four age groups (0 -3 months, 3 -6 months, 6 -1 2 months, > 12 months). Twenty-six were studied using several examinations. Echogenicity and degree o f vascularization were assessed qualitatively. Resistivity index (Rl) was measured in 78 cases and peak systolic velocity in 43. Results: All the lesions presented as vascularized tissular masses with nu merous arteries and veins. 63% of lesions w ere hypoechoic, 16% hyperechoic, and 21% mixed. All hypoechoic lesions showed high vascularity and 13/15 hyperechoic \u0130HA showed low vascularity. Mean Rl was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the first (0.61 \u00b1 0.14) and fourth (0.6 \u00b1 0.14) classes of age than in the second (0.51 \u00b1 0.12), and higher in the hyperechoic group (0.7 \u00b1 0.13) than in the hypoechoic (0.53 \u00b1 0.11) o r the mixed (0.56 \u00b1 0.12).

Dresel, K. Hahn; Munich/D Purpose: To assess the value of com bined imaging modalities fo r planning the therapeutic strategy in pediatric neuroblastomas. Materials and Methods: 63 MR and 49 l 123-MIBG exam inations were per formed prospectively in 41 patients (average age: 2.5 years). Intravenous Gd-DTPA was applied, and MR-angiography was performed in all MR exam inations. Image fusion was done using a 3D matching algorithm. Histology revealed neuroblastoma (n = 27), ganglioneurom a (n = 2), hepatoblastoma (n = 2), and Wilms tum or (n = 10). Results: In 71% of cases the tum or's origin could be clearly delineated in MRI, thereby indicating neuroblastoma. In these 30 patients M IBG-scintigraphy re vealed 3 false negative results. However, in 8/12 cases where MRI findings were unclear, MIBG-scintigraphy was proved neuroblastomas. As a whole body examination, MIBG-scintigraphy detected unknown metastases and re currences in 7/10 cases, later confirmed by MRI. Postoperatively, in 11 cases MRI demonstrated an unclear contrast enhancing mass that was suspected as a residual tumor, w hereas MIBG scintigraphy showed no activity in 9 of these cases. Conclusion: MIBG scintigraphy is an excellent tool for differentiating neu roblastomas, monitoring chem otherapeutic effects, detecting metastases and recurrences, and assessing residual tum ors. MRI and MRA are the methods of choice for operative planning. However, only both modalities combined with the image fusion technique can effectfully optimise the therapeutic management.",

Datar; Aberdeen/U K Bladder exstrophy is a problem that has plagued surgeons fo r many years due to the com plex musculoskeletal defects. The aim of this study w as to evaluate skeletal anomalies in bladder exstrophy syndromes with the objective of establishing parameters to aid surgical correction. A retrospective study of 48 cases of bladder exstrophy with preoperative C T scans was performed. Parameters evaluated included pubic diastasis, interischial distance, acetabu lar angle and acetabular anteversion. The measurements obtained were then analysed for statistical significance com pared with controls. Pubic diastasis increased significantly with age in bladder exstrophy. There was no significant increase in the interischial distance but this tended to vary with pubic diastasis. A significant increase in acetabular angle (controls 23 degrees; exstrophy 26.8 degrees) and a significant decrease in the acetabular anteversion (controls 17.66 degrees; exstrophy 8.04 degrees) was noted. We conclude that the relation between pubic diastasis and interischial distance signifies that the fulcrum o f rotation of the anterior pelvic arch passes at least partially through the ischial tuberosities. The increase in acetabular angle and decrease in acetabular anteversion denotes that there is rotation of the acetabulum into a sagittal plane. The biom echanical effect o f these observations would imply that these aberrations make the pelvis unstable and partly explain the increase in pubic diastasis with age.",

Longitudinal and diagonal m easurem ents of spleen were performed on a coronal slice obtained from the splenic hilum. Kidneys were measured on transverse and longitudinal axis. Results: Regression lines and correlation coefficients o f the organ sizes with age, body height and weight were investigated fo r girls and boys, separately.

Results: Quantitatively there was no significant difference between the two sequences although the EPI sequence tended to have low er lesion signal to organ, and lesion signal to noise ratios. Qualitatively: the EPI sequence had significantly less flow artifact (P < 0.5 Kruskal wallis test).

Contrast behaviour of anatom ical and pathological structures, and artifacts were judged by tw o independent observers. The results were statistically controlled by two-tailed W ilcoxon's test (statistically significant for p < 0.05). Results: Overall image quality w as superior in TSE sequences. Bright lesions were optimally visualised by TSE-2 and GRASE due to the low signal intensity o f pelvic fat. Hypo-and isointense lesions were better delineated in TSE-1. Chemical shift artifacts were significantly reduced in GRASE, w hereas blurring was pronounced. Motion artifacts did not reveal significant differences. Methods and Materials: Perfusion MRI using an FFE sequence was done in 27 women with proven cervical carcinoma. The first-pass contrast-enhancement of the tum or was quantified by maximum slope and am plitude of the timeintensity curves. These parameters were correlated with tum or invasion depth and lymph node status as assessed during surgery and in the hysterectomy specimen. Results: Tumors with lymphatic spread (n = 7) did not show steeper slope or higher amplitude than those without lymphatic spread (n = 20). Slope: 1.9 U/s \u00b1 0.9 v. 2.3 \u00b1 0.8; Amplitude: 23.9 U \u0436 15.3 v 32.9 \u00b1 10.1. Also, infiltration depth > 15 mm (in n = 8) did not correlate with dynamic parameters.

Conclusion: C ontrary to other investigators, we found no significant correla tion between parameters of MRI perfusion and tum or aggressiveness in cervix carcinoma. Methods and Materials: 35 patients with carcinoma of the cervix were studied on a 1.5 T Magnetom Vision System (Siemens) using a phased-array body coil. Heavily T2-weighted TSE sequences, STIR sequences and T 1 -weighted SE sequences with and without spectral fat saturation before and after Gd-DTPA were employed. All sequences were performed in the axial plane with identical image locations. Slice thickness was 5 -7 mm and spatial resolution < 1 mm. MR imaging results were com pared with histopathologic findings. Results: Using all sequences fo r the assessment of parametrial involvement the sensitivity was 92%, specificity 86% , and accuracy 90%. W ith T2-weighted TSE sequences a sensitivity o f 92%, a specificity of 78% and an accuracy of 84% could be achieved. For STIR sequences the respective values were 85, 75 and 79%; fo r T 1 -weighted SE sequences 85.20 and 50% ; and for fat saturated T 1 -weighted SE sequences 75.78 and 77%.

On both system s axial T2weighted FSE and T1-weighted SE images o f the pelvis before and after IV administration of Gd-DTPA were performed. Lymph nodes with a diam eter of > 8 mm were considered positive. In all patients MR imaging results were correlated with surgical-pathologic findings. Results: MR imaging with standard body coil had a sensitivity of 62.5% , a specificity of 82.3% and accuracy of 76.0%. W ith phased-array coil imaging, the respective data were 88.9%, 90.6% and 90.0%.

Politou, C. Kattamis, L. Vlahos; Athens/GR Purpose: To correlate MRI findings of pancreatic hemosiderosis with glucose disturbances and with total iron burden, in patients with b-thalassemia. Methods and Materials: Abdominal MR T1 and T2 weighted images, ob tained by thirty-five multiple transfused, b-thalassemic patients were reviewed blindly and retrospectively. Pancreatic signal intensity (PSI) was qualitatively evaluated as normal w hen greater than that of muscle (MSI), o r low when less or equal to MSI. Patients were categorized on the basis of oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) into three groups: group A: patients with normal OGTT, group B: patients with impaired OGTT, but asym ptom atic regarding glucose disturbances, group C: patients with clinically manifestated diabetes mellitus. Results: a) PSI w as normal in 5/11 and low in 6/11 patients of group A. Four patients o f group A with low PSI developed impaired OGTT in the following six months after MRI examination, b) Low PSI was observed in 8/10 patients of group \u0412 and in 11/14 patients of group C. c) No significant relationship between PSI and indeces of total iron stores, such as liver iron concentration, liver T2 relaxation tim es o r serum ferritin was revealed. Conclusion: MR imaging of pancreatic hemosiderosis seem s to associate with endocrine dysfunction o f the organ and might be used as a predictive sign fo r the developm ent of glucose disturbances. Nonetheless, the existence of pancreatic hemosiderosis does not correlate with liver iron content and total iron stores, in transfusional iron overloaded. Purpose: This clinical study was perform ed to evaluate the diagnostic potential of MRI for assessment of pancreatic masses. Results were correlated to other common imaging modalities, surgical exploration, laparoscopy, and histomorphological findings. Materials and Methods: 115 patients suspected to have a malignant mass of the pancreas were studied. MRI exam inations were done with respiratory gating on a 1.5 T ACS II (Philips) using T1w SE sequences (450/15), T2w TSE sequences (2500/120), and T2w SPIR sequences (3100/120). In some patients MRCP and MR angiography w as done additionally. Results were assessed by two independent, blinded radiologists and correlated to the methods of reference. Signal-to-noise (S/N) and contrast-to-noise (\u0421/N) ratios were determined. Results: In 75/115 patients a difference in signal intensity marked the malig nant pancreatic mass. \u0421/N ratio was statistically significant improved using the SPIR sequence. A vascular involvement o f the mass could only be depicted on MR angiography in case of a com plete occlusion, but with high sensitivity on axial scans.

Ros; Zaragoza/E, Florida/USA Purpose: It is well accepted that MRI can be a useful tool in imaging of the pancreas, as a com pliment o f the imaging findings seen initially with CT. The MRI appearance of the most common pancreatic diseases (adenocarcinoma and pancreatitis) is well known. However, knowledge of pancreatic MRI is limited primarily to the study of solid neoplasm s and inflam matory processes. We present the applications of MRI to the study of cystic neoplasms and inflammatory masses. Materials and Methods: W e have accumulated in the last four years thirty proven cases o f pancreatic cystic masses including true cysts (N = 3), pseudocysts (N = 15), cystic neoplasms (N = 5), and solid tum ors with cystic degeneration (N = 7). In all cases MRI was performed with a dedicated pancreatic MR protocol. Correlation with gross and microscopic features is offered when available. Results: MRI is helpful in outlining precisely the morphological features of pancreatic pseudocysts including their anatom ical relation to surrounding structures. MR is also helpful in detecting the hemorrhagic nature of pancreatic pseudocysts. MR depicts well the internal architecture o f microcystic adeno mas and mucinous cystic tum ors, allowing a precise differentiation between these two entities in many cases. MR also enables the differentiation of solid tumors from multiple true pancreatic cysts in patients with von Hippel Lindau disease. Conclusion: MRI is able to outline in detail the morphologic characteristics of pancreatic cystic masses, including the presence o f internal hemorrhage. To evaluate the effect of ultrasmall superparam agnetic iron oxide (USPIO) fo r imaging of the spleen. Material and Methods: 50 patients with normal spleen were examined at 1.0 T with T1W I, T1WI Fat Sat, T2W I, T2TSE before and after the administration of AMI 7227 (AMI Inc., Princeton, NJ). Signal intensity (SI), Signal to noise ratio (SNR) and contrast to noise ratio (CNR) was evaluated for the spleen for each sequence and statistically compared. Results: W e saw an increase in signal intensity in T1WI (38%, p < 0.3) and T1WI with Fat Sat (26%, p < 0.15). In T2WI the spleen demonstrated a decrease of signal intensity of 56% (p < 0.05) and in T2 TSE a decrease of 55% (p < 0.05). The contrast between spleen and the surrounding fat was in the T2 weighted images remarkable increased leading to an excellent delineation of the spleen. Conclusion: Using USPIO due to a signal intensity loss the visualisation and delineation of the spleen was improved in T2 weighted sequences. The T1 effects demonstrated a increase in S1 fo r T1W I with and without Fat Sat. The efficacy of USPIO in imaging of pathologic processes of the spleen is yet to be determined. It can be suppossed that in cases of spleen tum ors the delineation of this tum ors especially in T2W sequences is improved. There is no correlation between the severity of cirrhosis and splenic enhancem ent patterns (P = 0.78). Siderotic nodules are observed in 14 cirrhotic patients, but none in the control group (p < 0.005). The frequency of siderotic nodule is higher in patients with more severe cirrhosis (P < 0.05). Conclusion: W e characterized the splenic enhancem ent patterns by dynamic MRI, though the correlation between these patterns and live cirrhosis deserves further study. The presence of siderotic nodules in the spleen could be an indicator of the severity o f liver cirrhosis.",

Ros; Zaragoza/E, Florida/USA Objective: The aim of this presentation is to dem onstrate the spectrum of cystic splenic lesions and how using imaging criteria it is possible to narrow the differential diagnosis and potentially characterize them. Materials and Methods: Thirty splenic masses were studied by imaging techniques (ultrasound, com puted tomography, and/or magnetic resonance imaging). Pathologic correlation was performed both macro-and microscop ically in all casses. Entities analyzed include metastases (N = 8), primary splenic neoplasms -hemangioma, angiosarcoma, lymphoma (N = 6), infarcts (N = 5), cysts -true and false (N = 4), echinococcal cysts (N = 3), abscess (N = 2), lymphangioma (N = 1), and peliosis (N = 1). Results: Although significant overlap was noted, not allowing a specific diagnosis always, the following criteria were considered as suggestive for the following entities: (1) well-defined internal septa fo r true cysts, (2 ) egg shell calcifications fo r hydatid cysts, (3) thick and irregular wall fo r abscess, (4) multifocality and internal hemorrhage for infarcts, and (5) heterogeneous nature and internal calcifications fo r neoplasms. In many cases, once these findings were coupled with the clinical history, a diagnosis could be obtained.",

To evaluate the efficiency of molsidomine local delivery during hydrogel-balloon angioplasty in preventing throm bosis and neointimal hyper plasia (NIH), w hich can lead to restenosis. M ethods and Materials: Seven Pietrin pigs fed with atherogenic diet during 4 months received traum atic angioplasty in both iliac arteries at 2 months, and pharmacologic angioplasty (P-\u0410\u0440) with the hydrogel balloon loaded with molsidomine (150 mg) (M-\u0410\u0440, one iliac artery) or placebo (C-\u0410\u0440, the other iliac artery) at 4 months. The anim als were euthanized at 3 hours (2 pigs), 24 hours (2 pigs) and 3 m onths (3 pigs) after P-\u0410\u0440. Histological and immunohistochemical (PCNA, alpha-actin) patterns and endothelial surface platelet aggregation (scanning electron microscopy) were studied in iliac arteries. Results: No significant therapeutic effect was detectable 3 hours after M-Ap. At 24 hours, throm boresistance was significantly restored as compared with C -\u0410\u0440. At 3 months, M-\u0410\u0440 significantly prevented NIH and reset intimai throm boresistance at the arterial sites free of adventitio-medial dissection scar. Conclusion: Local delivery of molsidomine during angioplasty is feasible by using the hydrogel-coated balloon and has substantial anti-NIH and antithrom bosis effects attributable to the pharmacologic properties of molsidomine, a nitric-oxide-donor.",

Methods: Ninety-eight healthy volunteers were studied in five single and repeated-dose phase I trials, tw o of which placebo-controlled. Doses of BR1 ranged from 0.003 ml/kg bw (single) to 0.6 ml/kg bw (cumulative of three consecutive doses). Efficacy w as evaluated as improvement of \u0412-m ode signal in cardiac and Doppler signal in extracardiac studies. Safety was assessed in term s of subjective and physical observations, monitoring of vital signs, O2 saturation, Holter ECG and echocardiography, Mini-Mental State test, visual acuity and laboratory assessem ents prior to and after injection o f CM, Tolerance w as assessed as patient discom fort associated with the injection of CM. Adverse events (AEs) and safety parameters were monitored up to 2 4 -7 2 h post-dosing. Results: BR1 was always able to pass through the pulmonary circulation and to improve the endocardial border definition o f the left ventricle and the Doppler signal in different vascular districts. No serious AEs were recorded in any study. The non-serious A Es were transient, mild in intensity and unrelated to CM. No clinically significant changes in blood pressure, pulse rate, 0 2 saturation, respiration rate and ECG were observed.

Results: Composite maps showing activation superim posed on the T1weighted images were generated within one minute of com pletion of the acquisition. The speed of the acquisition and processing allow multiple, motionregistered fMRI runs to be made within a 30 minute examination.

Sometimes, the presence o f a second spot create the suspect of a recurrence without having any idea of the location. Normal superimposition techniques doesn't help in this case, as 1131 has no referrence point to compare with MR image. So we injected to the patient in the therapeutical phase 99 m-Tc DTPA to detect the skull position in relation to the therapeutical 1131 spot. The produced image may be superimposed to the MR to obtain the needed geometrical information. As we have seen in some clinical cases studied, the suspictious of a reccurence due to the presence of a second spot o r the growing of the main spot may be removed from the geometrical information obtained from the superimposition of the double isotope DTPA SPECT and MR images. Beside the application fo r imaging there are increasingly attem pts to use agents as power absorbing media fo r local hyperthermia.

U ltrasound is an im portant adjunct to the detection and diagnosis of mass lesions in soft tissues, close correlation and integration with other imaging m ethods is essential. For optimal results in each of these fields, the technical parameters must be well chosen: To keep the geom etrical unsharpness low, the focal spot must be small (100 micron in state-of-the-art magnification mammography). Novel tube technologies reach focus sizes < 40 micron. To keep the dose at tolerable levels, grids should not be used. The detectability of microcalcifications is improved in magnification mammog raphy a t the cost o f increased dose. W ith faster film-screen combinations, dose may be reduced while detection remains at the contact mammography level. Morphological analysis o f individual calcifications profits from the higher spatial resolution.

The increased spatial resolution at the detector level perm its digital mammog raphy with current storage phosphors with a potential increase in calcification detectability.

Thus an increasing num ber o f targeted biopsies are needed to reduce the number of unneces sary surgical interventions in non-m alignant breast lesions. Complementary imaging modalities might thus play a pivotal role in the management of inde term inate mammography. Scintimam mography (SM), being around since over tw o decades, has recently seen a revival with the use o f Tc-99m MDP, a well established bone seeking agent, and Tc-99m sestamibi, a monocationic com plex of Tc-99m with isonitrile groups that has initially been introduced as myocardial perfusion tracer. In spite o f a growing number of encouraging results with SM fundam ental points are still under debate: (1 ) W hat is the \"ideal tracer\" for SM (T1-201, Ga-67, Tc-99m sestamibi, Tc-99m MDP, F-18 FDG, ...), (2) W hat is the ideal imaging protocol (planar-tom ographic, prone-supine position), (3) W hen should SM be applied in correlation to the stage o f the dis ease (general screening, inconclusive mammography, high risk patients, post surgical follow-up, ...), the patients' age, physical condition (dense breasts, fibrocystic disease) and to other imaging modalities (ultrasound, magnetic resonance, ...), (4) Can SM reliably predict axillary or internal mammary node involvement, (5) Is the application of SM cost-effective? is an accepted method fo r the treatm ent of com plications of portal hypertension.

The portal puncture is performed, in m ost cases, with the only aid of a wedged hepatic phlebography with CO2. Ocasionally, an on-line delineation, with ultrasound, is still needed to achieve a safe portal access. A problem of TIPS, still not-solved, is stent or hepatic vein restenosis. There are several theories to justifie this frequent (75% ) com plication, like biliary contamination o f the shunt due to bile duct transection. Most cases respond favorably to PTA, however a second prosthesis (m ainly fo r hepatic veins) or even a second parallel shunt can be necessary. Refractory ascites is still a controversial indication fo r TIPS. Some series present a succes (no need of paracentesis, decrease in diuretics) as hig as 74% probably related to an increase o f renal sodium excretion.

Esophageal carcinoma is frequently advanced at presentation and surgery is inappropriate in approximately 5 0 -6 0 % of patients. The traditional method of palliation of patients with irresectable carcinoma is insertion of rigid plastic tubes under general anesthesia. These have a relatively small caliber and most patients cannot eat solid food. The overall complication rate is 36-40% . Recently, self-expandable metallic endoprostheses have become available. Some o f these are covered with plastic to prevent tum or ingrowth. These stents can be inserted under fluoroscopic guidance without the need for gen eral anesthesia because the introducing catheters are relatively small (1 8 -2 4 F); however the fully expanded stents have a large internal diam eter (16 mm -25 mm). These endoprostheses achieve excellent palliation of malignant dysphagia and most patients can eat a normal diet. The main problem with un covered stents is tum or ingrowth, which can be managed endoscopically with laser therapy.

In spite of its high frequency of performance obtaining a high quality chest radiograph remains one of the greatest challenges in diagnostic imaging. Conventional film-screen radiography has been the standard radiologic medium for chest radiography because of its semplicity, low cost, excellent spatial res olution and sensitivity. However there are limitations in its ability to provide optimal contrast in both the lungs and mediastinum. Current film-screen radiographic technique requires a com prom ise between the need for adequate contrast in local regions of the chest and overall image latitude. Limitations of conventional film-screen system s are more pronounced in bedside radiography.

Furthermore, there are also areas in the skull base, where several cranial nerves are close one to another: Orbital apex, cavernous sinus, pontocerebel lar angle, jugular foramen; also these anatom ical structures can be correctly showed using CT and MRI.

Reported sensitivity and specificity are remarkably high.

MIP provides efficient means o f providing an overview of morphologic data and is relatively insensitive to partial volum e averaging. 3D-imaging has a limited clinical need, only in com plicated pathology to assess topographic relations, i.e. size, orientation and volume, providing surgeons a preview assisting in planning of a customized surgical approach resp. surgical navigation. Manufactured physical models are used for surgical simulation and implant design. Multimodality matching links functional data with the morphologic substrate and com bines relevant structures only visible in different modalities. Since com puter vision has established itself as a vital component in decision making after data acquisition, design of reporting and clinical conference rooms is changing as rapidly as volume scanners are gaining interest. The two-step, fluoroscopically guided technique fo r percutaneous nephrostomy will be shown and explained in detail. W ith the first step the renal pelvis is punctured from dorsal with a 23 \" chiba needle and the obstructed system is opacified. In the second step a dilated posteriorly orientated calyx is punctured with a 19\" Lunderquist needle with teflon sheath from a dorso-lateral approach. A flexible guidewire with rem ovable core is introduced into the renal pelvis and the catheter is advanced over the guidewire into the renal pelvis. Thereafter the flexible wire is exchanged for an extrastiff Amplatz wire. All further procedures are perform ed over this wire. The parenchymal tract is dilated stepwise up to 9 F and a 8 or 9 F pigtail catheter is inserted. The optimal position of the pigtail would be a dilated upper calyx.",

The term \"quality practice\" in radiography implies that an acceptable level of professional standards is being met, and fo r many radiographers quality practice is synonymous with competence. However, unless one can specify w hat constitutes \"com petence\" , it is difficult to know w hat to expect. Therefore, making com petence explicit can allow a profession to publish statements about w hat their qualified members are com petent to do, and w hat people can reasonably expect of them. Ensuring that standards are easy to understand, also allows a decision to be made when incompetence occurs. A further advantage is that the standards (the separate elem ents of com petence) provide a foundation fo r curriculum devel opment and for the design o f valid assessm ent systems. Together with the competence required by a newly qualified radiographer fo r their first employ ment, the publication of standards can assist in the assessment of continuing competence.

This refresher course is divided into tw o sections, the first of which (part I) provides up-to-date information on the disease, its epidemiology, its pathophysiology and describes the imaging aspects of the disease in the luminal gastrointesti nal tract (conventional double contrast studies and endoscopy). The second section (part II) will describe the imaging aspects of the disease in other abdom inal organ system s (liver, spleen, pancreas, biliary tract and retroperitoneum ), using cross-sectional imaging modalities (ultrasound, computered tom ography and magnetic resonance imaging). Candidiasis, cytomegalovirus (CMV), cryptosporidiosis, histoplasmosis, isosporiasis, salmonellosis, toxo plasmosis, bacillary peliosis and unusual mycobacteria account for a majority of nonneoplastic disorders. Neoplasms include Kaposi's sarcom a (KS) en high-grade \u0412-cell lymphomas. Multiple sites may be involved in significant numbers o f patients. As radiologic experience accumulates, the predom inant radiographic patterns will become more clearly defined. This refresher course (part I/ll) will produce a cohesive account o f AIDS that will educate and guide radiologic practice. Purpose: The detection of radiotransparent foreign bodies, w hich account for the majority o f foreign bodies (FBs) to be found in soft tissue, has always constituted a diagnostic challenge fo r the radiologist w ho is called upon to facilitate the task of the surgeon and the medical examiner, and represent a significant gap in conventional radiodiagnostic. We assessed the validity of US in the diagnosis of FBs. Materials and Methods: Five sam ples of bovine muscular tissue 5 cm thick was used. By making 5 mm surface incisions, 20 w ooden, plastic and glass FBs having diameters ranging from 1 x 1 mm to 1 x 10 mm were introduced at various distances apart. Working independently and blindly, three ultrasographers evaluated the presence and size o f fragm ents, using a 7 .5 -1 0 MHz linear probe. Methods and Materials: radiography in tw o projections fo r 302 patients with direct repeated enlargement of image was carried out by apparatus \" REIS\" and \"Electr\u00f3nica 100D\" (Russia). Focus of the tube 0.015 x 0.015 /tm . Results: in the case of gunshot injuries of extremities on the 5 and 7 times enlarged radiographs, often there determ ined small foreign bodies of different density, inculcated by wounding shell (by mine splinters, shot, bone frag ments). C omputer analysis of color encoding and filtering to differentiate bone fragments and foreign bodies which were not enough contrasting. For gunshot osteomyelitis topom etry was carried out more distinctly: form of the centres, borders, depth of occurrence, sequesters. In soft tissues the differentiation of separate muscle group and dividing adipose layers disappeared. In the case o f swelling of hypodermic fatty cellulose there were disturbances of the clarity o f image of the inner outline of the skin and hypodermic fatty cellulose. With additional filtering on the background of colour encoding in the wound channels sometimes were exposed gas bubbles. The aim of this prospective study w as to evaluate the role o f a fast, whole body helical CT scanner fo r prim ary diagnosis in traum a patients. Materials and Methods: 27 severely injured patients (9 women, 18 men; mean age 43 years) were first exam ined with a helical CT scanner allowing for digital radiogramms up to a length of 1024 mm and continous helical scans of up to 70 seconds (slice thickness 3 to 10 mm, pitch factor up to 2). The primary CT diagnosis was proofed either by X-ray after the C T examination or within the following day, by abdominal ultrasound, by additional CT scans in the following days and by clinical follow-up. Results: CT detected all clinically relevant injuries of the head, spine, chest and abdomen. The diagnosis and classification of vertebral fractures and their am ount of damage to the spinal cord was performed immediately. 4% of the fractures o f the extremities and the ribs were not seen primarily. 6% of the injuries were out of the CT scan field. Conclusion: Helical CT is a reliable and fast method of obtaining vital infor mation and of improving m anagem ent planning, in severely injured patients. It reduces the number o f conventional X-ray exam inations and can replace ab dominal sonography. In certain cases additional X-rays of extremity fractures are required. , wrist (n = 8), ankle and foot (n = 16), knee (n = 11) and hip joint (n = 3), were examined by thin-section CT including multiplanar and 3D-reconstruction. Multiplanar reconstructions (MPR) were performed in two predefined perpendicular planes. 3D surface reconstructions were optimized fo r fracture visibility. The im pact of conventional radiographs, axial CT and MPR on final diagnosis and therapeutic management as well as the value of 3D-reconstructions fo r treatm ent planning w as assessed by two board-certified traum a surgeons.

Recent observations indicate the usefulness of Doppler US in the detection of increased or reduced vascularity of the bowels in certain disorders. Congenital vascular anomalies can be diagnosed with the combination o f conventional US imaging and duplex-Doppler method. New ultrasound techniques have been introduced: color Doppler imaging (GDI), color vascular imaging (CVI) and C VIQ (volume flow measurement), color am plitude imaging (CAI) (or power Doppler) (to detect slow flow). The possible impact of the new techniques will be discussed. Indications of abdominal Doppler ultrasound studies will be summarized: Liver/biliary: portal hypertension, portal thrombosis liver masses, liver trans plant, acute cholecystitis; R enal: renal artery stenosis, inflammatory diseases, renal masses; Bowel: appendicitis, inflammatory bowel disorders (Crohn's dis ease), intususception; Vessels: aneurysm , congenital anomalies, thrombosis (IVC, aorta, iliac). In some cases color Doppler US is sufficient to establish the diagnosis, in other cases we can select the patients fo r other vascular imaging studies (e.g. MRA, \u0421\u0422\u0410, angiography). Vascular ultrasound seem s to be an excellent, non-invasvive and cost-effective means to increase the confidence of the diagnosis. Limitations of the applications: operator dependency of abdominal Doppler examination and the need of respiratory cooperation. In shunt stenoses, balloon dilatation is the basic technic for most lesions and offers a technical success com parable to surgical interventions. In com plex cases, stent placement is required. Primary cum ulative shunt patency after stenting was 76% after 6 and 56% after 12 months. Due to reintervention, overall shunt function was 88% after six and 86% after 12 months. Atherectom y may be used in selected cases o f stent restenosis. Cutting PTA is a promising technique for resistant stenoses showing a 100% technical success and no particular complications.

Zollikofer; W interthur/CH Interventional radiology may be devided in into tw o large categories, vascular and non vascular interventions. A) Vascular interventions deal mainly with recanalisation procedures i.e. per cutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of arterial and venous obstructions. There is a vast num ber o f instruments being used ranging from steerable guidewires and various balloon catheters to devices fo r mechanical recanal isation such as aspiration catheters, various types o f drills and atherectomy catheters. For acute occlusions pharmacological thrombolysis and/or mechan ical thrombectomy devices may be used. On the other hand em bolisation procedures are performed to occlude abnormal or bleeding vessels such as in trauma, tumor, ulcers, infection o r arterial venous malformation and aneurysms. B) Non vascular procedures include mainly percutaneous biopsies fo r diagnos tic workups and drainage procedures such as abscess drainage or drainage of the biliary and urinary system. Lately endolum inal stents are increasingly used for palliation of strictures of the esophagus, stomach, duodenum and colon. The radiographer in the interventional room should be fam iliar not only with the various procedures but also with the instrumentation, patient monitoring and in most frequently used drugs in these procedures. Examinations performed in the radiology departm ent expose the patients to significant risks due to limitations in monitoring and therapy during transport and examination. Therefore, bedside im aging modalities such as plain radiog raphy (including special views) and ultrasonography are particularly important. The patients' cooperation is usually severely compromised, affecting image quality and diagnostic value of otherwise established examinations. Fast imaging modalities are required to overcome motion artefacts and decrease overall examination time. Life support devices may degrade image quality and even preclude specific examinations. Therefore, in these patients C T is usually superior to MRI. Imaging may be required out o f office hours performed by staff with limited experience. Modalities with unrestricted availability may thus replace dedi cated procedures (e.g. Spiral-CT versus pulm onary angiography in suspected pulmonary embolism). This presentation will deal with com m on diagnostic problem s and an approach to the optimum use of imaging procedures in ICU patients.",

Comm only performed ad ditional imaging studies, including ultrasonography and com puted tomography, enable many underlying causes to be diagnosed promptly, more accurately and less invasively, thus contributing to a decrease in mortality rates. Precise clinical history and thorough physical examination are, however, necessary to tailor the diagnostic approach to the individual patient. Plain abdominal radiographs remain the initial examination in acute nontrau matic abdominal conditions and may be m andatory in intestinal obstruction, when careful and methodical interpretation is exersised. Ultrasonography has shown to be extremely accurate in depicting abdominal absesses or intraperitoneal, pararenal o r perihepatic fluid collections. It can also diagnose acute cholecystitis and acute appendicitis, while it demonstrates parenchymal changes in traum atic abdom inal conditions. Computed tom ography offers the advantage of a simultraneous comprehen sive evaluation of both solid and hollow viscera in inflammatory, neoplastic and vascular disorders. It has revolutionized the evaluation o f patients with intestinal obstruction, allowing an accurate diagnosis, by defining the location and the likely cause and suggesting the presence of intestinal ischem ia or strangulation. Acute cholecystitis, abdominal abscesses, pancreatitis, pelvic inflammatory disease and acute mesenteric ischem ia are additional diagnostic posibilities fo r which CT has gained wide acceptance. C ontrast enchanced CT studies have also proved the diagnostic approach of choice in evaluating stable patients with blunt abdominal trauma. Over the years trauma has become one of the leading causes of mortality, especially fo r the younger population. Moreover, the socio-econom ic impact with al kinds and grades of disability, long hospital stay, and expensive rehabilitation is a trem endous burden for the society. Despite these facts, modern and appropriate trauma m anagem ent has not been discussed and taught too often in lectures, meetings o r symposia.",

Methods and Materials: 100 patients (1 9 -7 6 y) presenting low back pain or sciatica were studied with CT. The patients were selected in a 2 year period out of 770, on the basis of a normal CT study and absence of symptoms of spinal stenosis. In each of the L3, L4 and L5 vertebrae 3 slices were taken with the following measurements: A. Through the intervert\u00e9bral disc: 1. spinal canal area, 2. interarticular diameter, 3. interligam entous diameter, 8. Below the vertebral arcus: 1. dural sac area, 2. vertebral body area, C. Pediculolaminar level: 1. AP diam eter and 2. interpedicular diam eter of the spinal canal, 3. spinal canal area, 4. width of the lateral recesses and 5. Jones-Thomson index.

Andresen, C.J.G. Evertsz, D. Banzer, H.-O. Peitgen; Bremen/D Purpose: In this work we study the correlation between fractal dimension as a function of the threshold with the degree of osteoporosis based on HR-CT scans. Material and Methods: W e performed HR-CT of 16 lum bar vertebrae (continu ous slices, thickness 2 mm). The bone mineral density (BMD) w as determ ined using quantitative CT. A fter segmentation o f the spongiosa, we calculated the fractal dimension D of each vertebra as a function of the threshold value T normalized by the average gray value. Two param eters \u03c1 \u03bb and \u0440\u0433 were extracted from the function D(T) and correlated with the BMD. Results: The function >D(T) indicates the degree o f osteoporosis. The slope at T > 0 is significantly steeper in the cases with beginning osteoporosis than in the cases with severe osteoporosis. The threshold value for reaching the dimension D = 1 (param eter p \\) has a correlation coefficient with the BMD of r = 0.93, the average slope of the function D(T) in the range 7 = 0 to T = 0.5 (param eter \u0440\u0433) yields a value o f r = 0.91.. Conclusion: The quantization of the function D(T) allow s a good assessment of the degree of osteoporosis which is independent o f the BMD and only reflects the trabecular structure.

Methods and Materials: During 1995/96 about 40 stereo-lithographic models were built for operation planning; most o f these fo r severe cases o f cranio facial malformations. Total costs (personnel and material), quality of results (quality of correction and patient comfort), and process quality (reduction of planning and operation tim e and hospital stay) were com pared to former operations carried out without the use of stereolithographic models. Results: Operations that were not possible up to this date could now be carried out. The num ber o f corrective operations could be reduced. Operation time was decreased by an average of 20 to 50 percent. Surgical risks could thus be reduced and the quality of correction was decisively improved. Both factors led to increased patient satisfaction. The tim e for planning the operation could also be reduced. Total costs o f correction decreased up to 50 percent.

Early detection o f disturbed perfusion in the graft is essential fo r timely revision surgery of the vessel connections. Method and Patients: G raft perfusion was evaluated by a EBCT (electron beam com puter tom ography) flow study of a single 6 mm slice (exposure 300 msec, interscan time 2 sec). Twenty scans were recorded during administration of a nonionic contrast agent (90 ml, flow 5 ml/sec) into a cubital vein. Perfusion (ml/min per 100 g) was calculated as the ratio o f the maximum CT-value increase in the graft and the maximum CT-value in the carotic artery. Graft perfusion was evaluated by reference to the perfusion of a contralateral muscle. The technique was used in 22 patients after surgery. Results: T he results o f EBCT perfusion-measurements revealed positive perfusion values in all studied patients (n = 22). The perfusion index of the free-flaps were calculated with 0.1 to 0.6 ml/min/ccm. That way even in patients with clinical high suspicion of graft perfusion deficit (n = 1 ) were not reoperated and no necrotic tissue changes appeared in the postsurgical period (perfusion index = 0.2 ml/min/ccm). Conclusion: Positive EBCT perfusion results after free-flaps maxillofacial surgery is a useful method in addition to postsurgical invasive monitoring and may reduce unnecessary re-surgery in cases of malfunction o f invasive monitoring.

Marano; Rome/I Purpose: To assess the value o f conventional radiography, CT and MRI in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) of the craniocervical junction (CCJ) in comparison with the m ajor process variables of the disease.Methods and Materials: Thirty-eight consecutive RA patients (8 men, 30 women), aged 2 7 -7 0 years, disease duration ranging from 0.5 to 25 years (mean: 11.2), underwent plain radiographs (trans-oral anteroposterior, neutral, flexion, and extension lateral views), CT and MRI (pre and post Gadoliniumenhancement) of the CCJ. Imaging results were then correlated with dis ease duration, clinico-neurological course, immunoserology, and anatom oradiographic damage as assessed by hands/wrists and feet radiographs. Results: CCJ was involved in 25/38 (66%) patients, 12 of them (48%) showing atlantoaxial sub-luxations. Diagnosis was made on plain radiographs in 13/25 (52%), on either CT o r Gadolinium -enhanced MRI (Gd-MRI) in 4/25 (16%), on Gd-MRI in 8/25 (32%), CT being uncertain in 5 and negative in 3 of the latter patients. There were no statistically significant correlations with clinico-laboratoristic findings. Conclusion: CCJ is a common site of RA. Its involvement is not correlated with the major process variables, and is possible also in early RA.

M ethods and Materials: In 25 patients with AS, AP & lateral views and MRI of the T-L junction were taken. MRI was performed on 1.5 T manner (Siemens), with T1W precontrast, T2W and T1W postcontrast Gd-DTPA images. Results: Two distinct groups o f patients were differentiated. In 14 patients with typical Romanus lesions (RL) on plain films, MRI revealed high signal intensity on T2W and marked contrast enhancement on T1W postcontrast images at the insertion of annulus fibrosus. In 11 patients with Andersson lesions (AL) on plain films, focal and/or linear high signal intensity areas on T2W and T1W postcontrast images within the erosions o f the vertebral body endplates were shown. The adjecent bone marrow also demonstrated similar changes o f signal intensity. Conclusion: MRI findings in RL are consistent with active enthesitis at the insertion of the annulus fibrosus. Contrast accumulation within the AL could be explained by the exsistence of vascularised granulation tissue.

All MRA's were scored by three blinded readers and analyzed using Friedmann's test. Subsequently, 2D-PCA as the best technique w as applied in 35 pa tients undergoing vascular interventions and com pared with digital subtraction angiography. Results: ECG-triggert PCA-MRA provided best diagnostic information in all segments evaluated. The com bination of 2D-PCA to evaluate the vessel lumen (flow) with high-resolution orthogonal scans to evaluate the vessel wall appears to be suited for monitoring o f patients with vascular interventions.

Methods: Contrast-enhanced (0 .3 -0 .4 mm ol/kg Gd-DTPA) 3D SPGR data sets were acquired in 27 patients (10 f and 17 m) on a 1.5-T scanner (GE Echospeed). Evaluated aortic and renal pathologies included: coarctations (n = 4), aortic dissections (n = 4), aortic grafts (n = 7), double aortic arch (n = 1), abdominal aneurysms (n = 7), Leriche syndrome (n = 2), renal arterial stenoses (n = 4), and renal aneurysm s (n = 4). In addition to conventional view ing, the data were analysed using the VIE algorithm. VIE is a thresholding technique based on a ray casting algorithm in which the observer and an artificial light source are placed within the lumen o f the vessel under consideration. Results: Postprocessing with VIE, depicting intraluminal vessel walls was possible in all cases. W ith the exception o f intraparenchym al renal aneurysms, all vascular pathologies could be seen. Limitations of the technique include its dependence on the quality of the original data set and its dependence on the threshold used. Conclusion: We have shown that VIE can consistently be performed using MR data sets acquired with a contrast enhanced 3D gradient-echo technique.

Ebner; Graz/A Purpose: of this retrospective study is analysis and evaluation of possible applications o f the non-invasive MRA in pediatric neuroradiology in correlation with clinical findings, conventional angiography and/or CT. Methods and Materials: 56 children (11 days -16 years; m:f = 29:26;sedation/general anaesthesia in 24) were examined with a total of 68 MR As between 5/93-2/96. A 1.5 Tesla unit (Gyroscan ACS II, Philips, Netherlands) was used. Standard MRI \u00b1 Gadolinium was followed by MRA (3D-PCA with velocity encoding of 2 0 -8 0 cm/sec and/or 3D-TOF; MIP and reconstruction). Angiography w as available at corresponding dates in 19 cases.Results:The following pathology w as demonstrated in 25 children: sinus-vein throm boses (n = 4), m oya-moya disease (n = 1), postoperative pseudoa neurysm (n = 1), DVA (n = 1), AVMs (n = 10), postthrombotic stenosis of the M CA (n = 1), spasm o f the MCA due to subarachnoidal hemorrhage (n = 1), vessel displacem ents (n = 4), VGMs (n = 2), variant of the PCA (n = 1). 27 exam inations were negative, 4 didn't have diagnostic quality.Conclusion: MRI/MRA are the m ethods o f choice for sinus-vein thrombosis (additional information about complications, etiology, recanalisation). Positive MRI/MRA findings can obviate conventional catheter angiography. MRI/MRA have a high positive and negative predictive value fo r AVMs and are used in non-invasive follow-up. Angiography remains gold standard in this respect.

Tesoro-Tess, G. Cefalo, L. Balzarini, E. Ceglia, G. Trecate, R. Musumeci; Milan/I Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic possibilities o f Gd-DTPA enhanced MRI in detecting persistent o r relapsing disease during the follow up of childhood posterior fossa PNETs. M aterials and Methods: The 553 post-surgical MRI examinations performed during the follow up of 116 patients treated between 1985 and 1995 were reviewed: besides cranial evaluation, spinal imaging was available in 287 (52%) cases. MRI results were com pared with the clinical course of the disease, subsequent imaging studies and in 279/553 (50%), with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology. Results: Before starting the combined treatm ent o f radio-and chemo-therapy, persistent disease was demonstrated in 43.5% o f patients. Similarly, 25% of patients considered disease free after surgery developed relapse during the follow up; posterior fossa was the most common site of tum or spread (73%), w hereas 41% developed metastases within the spinal canal. Extraneural dissemination occurred in four patients, three with bone metastases alone and one with contem poraneous SNC and testicular diffusion. Overall, Gd-DTPA enhanced MRI demonstrated 96% accuracy, 87% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Conclusion: Com plete resection is possible only in 55-60% of patients. Posterior fossa is the m ost common site (73% ) o f tum or spread. Spinal m etastases develop in more than 40% of patients.

All patients were followed up by 1.5 T MRI 0 1 -8 .4 years after initial head traum a using T1w, pd, T2w and sag. MP-RAGE sequences without contrast administration. Results: In 34/70 children extra-axial hematoma (13 EDH, 21 SDH) were seen acutely. MRI demonstrated no residual lesions after isolated epidural hematoma, but underlying cortical defects in 9/21 children with subdural hematoma. 50/70 children showed evidence o f intraaxial lesions, whereas only 27/50 were seen with CCT. Additional lesions could be revealed with MRI in 31/70 patients.

Material and Methods: After intensive clinical examination including functional tests HRCT was performed in 78 patients (mean age 10.8 years). It was checked, if the CT findings could explain the symptoms and functional findings. Furthermore, the therapeutic consequences were noted. Results: Dysplasias of the middle ear and/or the external auditory canal were found in 32 of 35 tem poral bones (\u0422\u0412) with conductive hearing loss. Combined hearing loss (14 \u0422\u0412) w as clarified com pletely o r partially in half the cases.

M aterialsand Methods: C T and MR imaging was performed in 15 patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and known abdominal wall o r intraab dominal desmoids. Nine patients had follow-up by both C T and MR imaging, 4 patients had CT within the previous 12 months. Pre and post gadolinium T1-weighted sequences and T2-weighted sequences were obtained on a 1.5 T GE Signa. Change in size on follow -up w as recorded. Results: CT demonstrated 35 desmoid tumours: 22 were intraabdominal and 13 were in the abdominal wall. MR imaging identified 21/22 intraabdominal desmoids and all o f the abdominal wall desmoids. MR imaging and CT agreed precisely for their site. C T w as more effective in demonstrating their relationship to bowel. C ontrast enhancem ent was more easily identified on MR imaging than CT, especially when this was inhomogeneous. Eight desmoids demonstrated significant growth on follow-up, all of w hich had high signal on T2-weighted images. Conclusion: MR imaging can detect both intraabdominal and abdominal wall desmoid tum ours in familial adenom atous polyposis. High signal on T2weighted sequences was seen in all desm oid tum ours that had shown marked growth on follow-up imaging. Sutureless percutaneous term inolateral bypass anastom osis D. Vorwerk, K.

The indications included hypertension in 27 and claudication in 2 patients. The diagnosis w as based on the criteria established by the Aortitis Syndrome Comm ittee o f Japan. All procedures w ere performed by trasfem oral route. There w ere 17 fem ales and 12 males, ages ranging from 5 to 38 (mean, 19) years. Results: The lesion was located in descending thoracic in 17 and in abdominal aorta in 13 patients (one patient had tw o stenoses). Technical success was obtained in 24 and clinical benefit in 25 patients. Localized non-obstructing intimai flaps were seen a t the PTA site in 15 patients. Four patients devel oped and obstructing dissection. O f them, tw o were treated by a stent, one underwent surgery and the fourth w as m anaged conservatively. One patient developed a pseudoaneurysm during follow up [range, 3 -8 6 (mean, 29)] months. Remodelling at the PTA site with further angiographic improvement was seen in most patients. Restenosis was seen in one patient. This was successfully redilated. Conclusion: Aortic PTA has technical problem s in presence of nonspecific aortoarteritis, but is safe and effective in treating symptomatic stenoses. Suboptimal technical result can be associated with clinical benefit due to remodelling at PTA site.",

Langer; Essen/D Purpose: To assess the clinical relevance of thoracic CT in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with blunt thoracic traum a in comparison with conventional X-rays. Methods and Materials: For the retrospective study 124 com parative CT and X-ray exam inations of 58 ICU patients were evaluated. The reasons for thoracic C T of ICU patients included unclear worsening of the pulmonary status under controlled ventilation (n = 56), septicemia with unknown focus (n = 24), injuries o f the thoracic wall (n = 2), and control of ventilated lung areas during dorso-ventral patient-positioning change therapy fo r improving ventilation. The estim ation criteria were: presence of pneumothoraces, pleural fluid, densening of lung parenchym a and the detection o f lung parenchyma lacerations. The size o f the lesions in CT were measured and the percentage o f involved lung volum e calculated. Results: C T is superior to X-rays in the diagnostics o f infiltrates, abcesses and atelectasis, especially in the estimation of the size of the lesions. In ou r study the thoracic C T had had immediate therapeutic consequences in 84% (106/126 cases): dorsoventral ventilation therapy (n = 78), CT-guided intervention (n = 22), and thoracotom ia (n = 6). Some m inor findings were only detected in CT: ventral pneum othoraces smaller than 2 cm (n = 20), pleural effusions m inor 200 ml (n = 18 m), and parenchym a lacerations smaller than 2 cm (n = 14). Conclusion: Due to the superiority of C T com pared with conventional X-rays and due to the high percentage of therapeutic consequences we recommend that thoracic CT be integrated in the diagnostics o f ICU patients with blunt thoracic trauma.14:40 502 C hest CT: Evidence of pre-existing pathology in diving-related pulm onary barotrauma M. Reuter, K. Tetzlaff, M. Heller; Kiel/D Purpose: Arterial gas embolism due to barotrauma of the lungs is a severe com plication in compressed air diving. Precipitating factors are often missed in plain film radiology. This study was conducted to detect occult lung disease predisposing fo r the developm ent of pulm onary barotrauma in conditions associated with a change in am bient pressure. Materials and Methods: During the past four years eleven patients who have suffered pulm onary barotraum a with o r without subsequent developm ent of cerebral o r spinal arterial gas em bolism underwent com puted tom ography of the chest several days postinjury. Chest plain film s were available in all cases. Results: In five patients CT revealed subpleural em physem atous blebs or cysts not detected by conventional radiography. Follow up studies performed several m onths postinjury showed that the cystic lesions did not resolve. Conclusion: The lung cysts o r blebs are obviously preexisting conditions having triggered pulm onary rupture by trapping of air. Computed tom ography of the chest -preferably in the spiral mode -is recommended in any case of suspected pulm onary barotrauma to evaluate the possibility of preexisting pathology in order to predict future fitness to dive.14:50 503 Pneumorachis following asthm a-induced barotrauma: CT recognition of an unusual manifestation of life-threatening asthma G.

Differentiation between benign and m alignant lesions can be improved but depends from a num ber of technical and investigator dependend variables. Methods and Materials: In order to define a standardized examination tech nique we investigated 458 patients with breast lesions. An Ultramark 9-HDI (ATL) was used with a linear transducer L 10-5. Results: On average 2 tum or arteries were found in 325 benign lesions and 11 arteries were detected in 133 carcinomas (p < 0.0001). The minimum Resistance Index showed only a small difference with 0.64 in benign and 0.61 in m alignant tum ors (n.s.). Average flow velocity in benign tum ors was 9.7 cm /s and in m alignant tum ors 19 cm /s (p < 0.0001). Total tum or vascularity, estimated by summarizing all systolic flow velocities was 22.2 cm/s in benign and 253.5 cm/s in malignant tum ors (p < 0.000).Conclusion: C olor Doppler is useful to characterize benign and malignant lesions. Due to biological variables the overlap of flow data is 10%. In such difficult conditions new ultrasonic contrast agents may become useful fo r better differentiation of lesions.

The current spectrum of interventional MR-guided procedures covers interstitial ablative therapies (eg. radiofrequency thermal ablation, laser ablation, external focused ultrasound, ethanol injection) and MR-guided percutaneous biopsy-and drainage procedures. Developments in hard-and software allow some conventional percutaneous needle-guide wire-catheter-based interventions: Due to the strong dependence o f catheter based passive image artifacts on pulse-sequence parameters and its location within the magnetic field, w ires and catheters are being developed that can be actively visualized (eg. antennae, endolum inal surface coils).

The initial recommendation included the age group 4 0 -74. Later, certain reservations were added concerning the age group 4 0 -5 0 . Training centers were established, basically coinciding with the trial centers. Screening was implemented mainly during the second half of the 80:ies and in 1994 23 out of 26 counties had screening program s running. In a survey it w as shown that fifty per cent of the counties offered screening from the age of 40, thirty-five per cent from the age o f 50, the remaining starting between 45 and 50. Forty per cent stopped screening at aged 70, sixty per cent at aged 74. The Swedish program s are population based. All but one program charge a fee varying between 8 and 28 USD.

Van Gansbeke: Brussels/BPurpose: To determ ine prospectively the value o f C T as a primary diagnostic procedure fo r the diagnosis and the treatm ent of adhesive small bowel obstruction. Methods and Materials: The study group included 82 patients with a small bowel obstruction collected consecutively over an 18-month period. Patients in the post operative period (1 month) were not included. CT images were interpreted prospectively in consensus by a fellow resident and an experi enced gastro-intestinal radiologist. Readers were asked to detect the cause of small bowel obstruction, and signs of severity (closed-loop, volvulus and strangulation). CT findings were correlated with the surgical results and with the patient outcome.Results: CT enabled the diagnosis of adhesive obstruction in 43/45 patients (sensitivity: 96%), with 4 false positives (specificity: 89%). Thirty-one patients (69%) were treated medically in the absence of CT signs of severity; 10 of them were operated after failure of this treatm ent. Fourteen patients underwent an immediate laparotomy because of the clinical and/or C T findings. Closed loop, volvulus and strangulation were correctly suspected o r ascertained in respectively 16/16 patients, 8/10 patients and 8/8 patients. There was 2 false positive C T diagnoses of volvulus and 3 false positive fo r strangulation. Conclusion: CT should be the prim ary procedure in the diagnosis of adhesive small bowel obstruction and in the selection of patient fo r immediate surgery. 10:55 584 Methyl cellulose enteroclysis spiral-CT: Technique, examination quality and com plications -Experiences in 110 patients E.

Mostbeck; Vienna/A Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of the new method Methyl Cellulose Enteroclysis Spiral-CT (MCESCT). Methods and Materials: Up to now a total of 110 consecutive with suspected small bowel diseases (Crohn's disease = 81, small bowel tum or = 13, ad hesion ileus = 8, other = 8) were prospectively studied. MCESCT technique: Application of a jejunal tube, rapid instillation of methyl cellulose (flow 150 ml/min, max. 2000 ml), Spiral-CT of the abdomen (collimation = 5 mm, pitch = 2, reconstruction interval = 3 mm) during i.v. contrast administration (120 ml, flow = 4 ml/sec, scan delay = 25 sec).Results:In 70 patients (63.6%) a good study quality (adequate distension of all small bowel loops) could be achieved. 20 patients (18.1%) had a som ewhat limited (e.g. collapsed upper jejunal loops), 11 patients (10%) had a poor examination quality (inadequate bowel distension). In 9 patients (8.2%) MCESCT had to be early term inated (tube refusal, local pain during i.v. contrast administration). Side effects in 12 patients (10.9% ): vom iting n = 7, nausea n = 6, probably study related subileus n = 1. All other 89 patients tolerated the examination well. Conclusion: MCESCT is a new, safe method which enables an accurate assessment of all small bowel loops in the vast majority of studies 11Efficacy of helical CT for the detection of adhesions in patients with small bowel obstruction E. Challier, M.F. Beilin, C. Barrat, J. Duron, L. Ghebontni, P. Grenier; Paris/F Purpose: To assess the efficacy of helical CT for the detection of adhesions in patients with small-bowel obstruction (SBO) and to determine the predictive values of several C T signs for suggesting the diagnosis of adhesions. Methods and Materials: 33 consecutive adult patients with a clinically and radiographically suspected diagnosis of SBO were prospectively studied with helical CT (enhanced 5 -1 0 mm slices, pitch 1). They included 8 patients (group A) with surgical confirmation o f adhesions, 13 patients (group B) with non-mechanical obstruction (postoperative paralytic ileus n = 8, sepsis n = 2, mesenteric ischemia n = 3) and 12 patients (group C) with mechanical obstruction (neoplasms n = 10, internal and external hernias n = 2). In each group of patients, we calculated the positive and negative predictive values of 13 CT signs of obstruction for the diagnosis o f adhesions. Results: The following CT signs had a positive predictive value exceeding 80% fo r the diagnosis of adhesions: 1) abrupt disparity of the caliber between tw o consecutive loops 2) marked pre-stenotic dilatation of a bowel loop. Neoplasms (n = 10) were detected and localized with C T in all cases. Conclusion: C T allows assessment of both the detection and localization of SBO. Two CT signs highly suggest the presence of adhesions.",

Barozzi; Bologna/I Purpose: Ureteral diverticula belong to the group of acquired diverticula even if their pathogenesis and clinical significance are still a subject o f dispute. They are occasionally detected during urography o r retrograde urogram and appear as small spicular o r saccate outpouchings of the wall, single o r more often multiple, limited for the most part to the upper third of the ureter. The frequent association of these lesions with transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary tract is a problem of great clinical interest since they could represent a premalignant manifestation. Material and Methods: We report on 16 patients with pseudodiverticula: all were males over 46 years. They were studied with urography and 6 with retrograde pyelography. Results: Ureteral involvement w as bilateral in 50% o f patients, 4 of whom were affected by sinchronous o r metachronous vesical neoplasia. The radio logical picture shows small marginal outpouchings 1 -3 mm in diameter. Their demostration require a good contrast opacification and distension of the ureter. Conclusion: The reported observations confirm data in the literature on the high association between pseudodiverticula and transitional cell carcinoma. These patients may thus be considered a risk group fo r neoplasia, even if no precise confirmation exist that these hyperplastic alterations always precede onset o f tumor. Patients with pseudodiverticula of the ureter therefore require careful clinical-radiological control with a view to detecting early signs of malignant metaplasia.

Methods and Materials: A com bined FDDI/Ethernet network is in daily use including all radiologic imaging modalities from different manufacturers (Siemens, GE and Philips). O ver 15 workstations are connected incl. neuro surgery and radiotherapy planning systems, ICU viewing stations as well as CT and viewing stations outside the hospital via ISDN. Beside DICOM three different IP-compatible protocols are used. A PACS including RAID and CD-ROM jukeboxes for image archiving is currently installed. Frequent transfer failures, connection problem s and their solutions have been evaluated. Results: The integration of new imaging modalities and w orkstations is still difficult. First connections between workstations frequently failed even using DICOM protocol. Reasons are e.g. incom plete header informations o r differ ences in the interpretation o f DICOM. A fter improving the configurations and using additional conversion software to pure DICOM the integration o f all modalities has been successful. Conclusion: DICOM 3 is a developing standard.

For image viewing and reporting 4 w orkstations, multiple PCs with \u0425 -Client and different printing modalities are available, including slide maker.Connection of different Ethernet-segm ents is realised by a high-speed switch (70 Mbit/s throughput). Results: Image input is about 2.5 GB per day into the central PACS. About 15 minutes after study com pletion images are available for com parison or demonstration in radiological conferences. Transferring studies from tem porarily harddisk (20 GB) to w orkstations takes about 5 minutes, transfer from longtime archive (2*330 GB CD-Jukeboxes) to workstations takes about 20 minutes because of reading time from CD. Online availability of form er studies improve reporting in 20% of all examinations. Cost reduction can be achieved by using paper prints instead of laser film. Conclusions: Independent DICOM-PACS of radiological devices from differ ent manufacturers is established fo r routine use. Archiving and retrieving is easier, faster and more efficient.

T1-weighted and T2-w eighted images were performed in all patients. Immediate and 5 -1 0 minute delayed T1weighted spoiled gradient echo images were acquired in 15/18 patients. Results: Focal lesions of hepatic lymphoma were well defined m asses with mild to m oderate low signal intensity relative to liver on T1-w eighted images. Lymphoma lesions in eight patients were moderately high in signal intensity on T2-weighted images com pared to liver (Type I lesions). Six of these patients underwent gadolinium administration, and enhancem ent o f lesions w as intense on early post gadolinium images in five of these patients. Lym phom a lesions in seven patients were mildly hypointense to mildly hyperintense on T2-weighted images compared to liver (Type II lesions). Six of these patients underwent gadolinium administration, and lesions in five of these patients enhanced minimally on the early post gadolinium spoiled gradient echo images. The imaging findings in 3/18 patients w ho were already on therapy were variable. Transient ill-defined perilesional enhancement on immediate post gadolinium spoiled gradient echo images w as observed in 9/14 patients w ho underwent gadolinium administration. Conclusion: Focal lesions of hepatic lymphoma are usually low in signal inten sity on T1-weighted images but have variable signal intensity on T2-weighted images. The degree of hyperintensity on T2-w eighted images correlates with the degree of enhancement.11:15 652 The pseudocapsule in hepatocarcinoma (HCC): MR findings related to pathological features L.

Bartoli; M arseille/F Purpose: Twenty percent o f local recurrence after high-dose radiotherapy of nasopharyngeal carcinom as (NPC) justify systematic follow -up essentially in patients initially staged T3 -T4.The purpose o f this study is to assess the role o f medical imaging in the multidisciplinary follow -up o f these patients. Methods and Material: Thirty-nine cases of NPC treated from 1989 to 1994 were retrospectively reviewed, including clinical, endoscopic, patho logic records, CT-scan and MRI exam inations performed during follow-up. All patients benefited of contrast enhanced CT-scan o r MRI at least every 6 months.Results:The volum e regression and contrast-enhancement decreasing in stages T 3 -T4 were inconstant and often incomplete, even with negative biopsies. T1-weighted MRI showed spontaneous hypersignal in prevertebral muscles due to fatty involution. MRI allowed biopsies to doubtful tissue invisible with endoscope in 4 cases. It detected 4 recurrences in paracavernous sinus o r submucosal location. Conclusions: In spite of difficulties to interpret residual foci of contrast enhancement, MRI seems essential to oversee tum or regression, detect early recurrences and guide biopsies. Perineural infiltration in nasopharyngeal carcinoma V.F.H. Chong, Y.F. Fan; Singapore/SGP Purpose: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) frequently spreads intracranially. This study describes the utility of MRI in the identification of intracranial spread as a result o f perineural infiltration. Methods and Materials: O ne hundred and fourteen consecutive patients with proven undifferentiated NPC were evaluated with T1-, T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced MRI and CT. Results: MRI showed 35 (31%) patients intracranial extension. Of the subset of 35 patients with intracranial spread, 21 (60% ) patients showed involvement of the maxillary nerve (4 patients, 11%) and the mandibular nerve (17 patients, 49%). CT could identify 26 (23%) patients with intracranial spread. C T identi fied foramen rotundum widening in 3 (9%) patients and erosion of the foramen ovale in 12 (34%) patients. Conclusion: NPC shows a high incidence o f maxillary and mandibular in filtration and subsequent intracranial spread. This is best identified directly by contrast-enhanced MRI.

Fournier, G. Pitzer, G. Bongartz, W. Steinbrich; Basel/CH Purpose: Aim of this prospective study was to determ ine the frequency of anterior neopharyngeal diverticulum formation as a possible cause of postoperative dysphagia in 18 laryngectomized patients. Methods: All patients were examined by indirect laryngoscopy and a barium swallow. Results: Six patients com plained of postoperative dysphagia. Indirect laryn goscopy showed a tissue band, separating the diverticulum from the neophar ynx, in all symptomatic as well as in three asymptomatic patients. The barium swallow confirmed all diverticula suspected during laryngoscopy, in five patient additional diverticula were diagnosed. Conclusion: Anterior neopharyngeal diverticula occur frequently after laryn gectomy (78% of our patients), not necessarily causing clinical symptoms. The most important indication to perform a barium swallow in patients with post operative dysphagia is the differentiation between tum or recurrence and other etiologies of dysphagia. If an anterior neopharyngeal diverticulum is present, the barium swallow demonstrates the size o f the diverticulum, a possible reten tion after swallowing and rarely an obstruction of the pharyngeal lumen during deglutition. For this reason dysphagia in laryngectomized patients needs fur ther diagnosis with a barium swallow. In this context the radiologist must be aware of diverticulum formation, an entity poorly recognised until now.",

Material and Methods: Videofluorography was performed by X-ray exam ina tion of 40 patients in upright position in lateral view during swallow ing o f small portions (8 -1 2 ml) of water soluble contrast media (loprom id 370, Schering, Berlin). All images were recorded on magnetic tape (U-matic, Sony, Cologne) for further evaluation. After reviewing the images they were digitized through a matrix of 2 5 6 '2 5 6 pixels with 8 bit greylevel (M IRPON, Kontron, Munich). Movement o f epiglottis, contraction o f the pharynx and propulsion o f tongue as well as the opening o f the upper esophageal sphincter were assessed qualitatively.

Typical curves showed tim ely flow o f the contrast medium through the phar ynx. Impeded swallow could be clearly distinguished from normal m ovem ent pattern. Conclusion: Detailed quantitative movement analysis based on grey level changes o f the digitized fluoroscopic images allows differentiation of the swallowing act into normal and pathologic patterns.11:30663 Dysphagia following resection, reconstruction and radiotherapy for oral and oropharyngeal carcinom as -A videofluoroscopic study S. M a rr\u00e9 1, P. Z b \u00e4 re n 1, M. B ecker2, P. R u ijs 1, P.

Objective of this study w as to check the usefulness o f videofluo roscopy to localize the underlying disorders. Material and Methods: 25 patients with \u0422\u0433 -T 4 oral and oropharyngeal carci nom as free of recurrence, were studied with a standardized videofluoroscopy using four different consistencies o f barium. These studies w ere checked for functional and morphological changes of oral and pharyngeal phase. Results: Most patients com plained about difficulties swallowing solid food, aspiration, dry mouth and prolongation of meals. Radiologically oral and pharyngeal phase were impaired. W e found reduced oral bolus control with premature leakage, depending on the consitency of barium, aspiration, inability to swallow a solid bolus and reduced contractions to the pharynx with pooling. Conclusion: Viedeofluoroscopy with different consistencies of barium is a useful radiological method to evaluate posttherapeutic dysphagia o f patients with oropharyngeal carcinomas.S 133",

CT score correctly depicted only 3/23 histopathologically benign lesions. The remaining 20 benign lesions were CTscored as malignant (n = 3) o r uncertain (n = 17). When uncertain CT scores were combined with clinical scores, true positive and true negative results for malignancy increased from 42% to 80%.Conclusion: CT in combination with clinical information gives in most cases enough information about the nature -m alignant or benign -of a skeletal lesion.

Methods and Materials: From 1 9 86-1 996 we performed 912 examinations in patients with soft tissue sarcomas (214 primary tumors, 197 patients with local recurrence). Results: MRI provided exact information regarding localization, extent and characterization of soft tissue tum ors as well as detection of small recur rent tum ors < 5 mm especially when using T1-weighted sequences with Gadolinium-DTPA and/or STIR sequences. In the diagnosis of local tumor recurrence MRI was correct in 172 cases. False positive results were obtained in 15 cases and false negative results in 10 cases. The false positive results were due to early postoperative or radiotherapy induced changes of adjacent soft tissue while false negative results were due to posttherapy changes o r the tumor was located outside the examination field o f view. Characteristic time dependant changes o f soft tissue signal intensity can be demonstrated. Conclusion: Com pared to other imaging modalities MRI proves to be the method of choice fo r determ ination of extent, characterization of soft tissue masses and early detection of local um or recurrence. 16:25 671 MRI of primary lym phom a of bone: Cortical disorder as a criterion for differential diagnosis M.D. Haussier, M.J.

The patients had an osteoid osteoma of the tibia (n = 7) and of the fem ur (n = 3). Within the 24 hours proceeding surgery, a small hole was drilled directly over the nidus with a 15 gauge O stycut bone biopsy needle with the control and guidance o f the CT. And we stained hole and needle tract with Gentian violet. We used the GE 9800 and Hi Speed Advantage C T (GE), and obtained both 2D and 3D images during the procedures. Results: Each osteoid osteom a w as in the cortex of the bone. The nidi ranged in size from 10x6x6 to 4 0 x 7 x 9 mm. The sclerotic areas around the nidus ranged size from 150 x 18 x 14 to 50 x 15 x 12 mm.

Genant; M\u00fcnster/D Purpose: To evaluate the relationship between biomechanically determined bone strength versus BMD and texture analysis of trabecular bone using high resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HrMRI) of bone specimens. Material and Methods: 29 bone specim ens were harvested from 11 human cadaver spines. HrMRI (GE, Signa) was performed at 1.5 T with a slice thickness of 0.3 mm and an in plane resolution of 156 mm. The images were subjected to texture analysis using morphological param eters analogous to the histomorphometric measures, fractal dimension using a box-counting algorithm and co-occurrence matrices. BMD measurements were obtained using quantitative C T (GE, 9800). Non-destructive testing was performed to assess biomechanical bone properties. Results: The correlation coefficient between elastic modulus and BMD was r = 0.81 (p < 0.01). C orrelations of elastic modulus versus morphological measures, fractal dimension and co-occurrence matrices were also significant and varied from r = 0.47 to r = 0.80. Multi-regression analysis of BMD and texture measures together significantly increased correlations with elastic modulus (r = 0.86-0.92). Conclusion: In an experimental setting texture parameters calculated using HrMRI images correlated significantly with bone strength. Combining texture with BMD resulted in the highest correlations with bone strength. Thus texture analysis of HrMRI provides an additional param eter to analyze bone quality and strength.16:20 681 CT-appearance of the new form ation of trabecular bone in femoral implants in HRCT: An animal study H.D.

Methods and Materials: 48 tubes were implanted into the left fem ur of 24sheep. Sites o f implantation: proximal metaphysis and diaphysis. In group 1 the metaphysary, in group 2 the diaphysary tube was filled with spongiosa. After 6 months the amount of trabecular bone was determ ined placing ROI's in 6 defined HRCT slices in each tube (A = 64 mm2, slice thickness 1 mm, total number of slices: 288).

Results: HRCT (mean value of trabecular bone 6 slices/tube): metaphysary 22.4 mm2 vs diapyhysary position 6.4 mm2 (p < 0.01). In the metaphysary position the amount decreased from 28.2 mm2 (cranial) to 12.8 mm2 (caudal slice) -without differences between group 1 and 2.

Besides micro-com puted tom ography, high resolution magnetic resonance im aging (HR-MRI) has recently been employed fo r this purpose. It is the aim o f this study to dem onstrate the feasibility of characterizing phalangeal bone structure in vitro using a standard wholebody MR-system and to investigate the potential of this technique fo r in vivo applications. Proximal phalanges were investigated using a 1.5 T Siemens Magnetom Vision MR-system, employing a 4 cm surface coil for signal reception. Proton MR images were acquired using a 3 dimensional (3-D) spin echo M RI-sequence (TR = 100 ms, \u0422\u0415 = 13 ms). In vitro, the total acquisition time o f a 3-D data set (512 X 512 \u0436 128 matrix) was 1 h 49 min fo r a voxel size of (125 x 125 X 200) \u03bc \u03af\u03c4\u03b93. For in vivo applications on healthy volunteers measurem ent time was reduced to 16 min acquiring a 3-D data set with a spatial resolution of (150 x 150 x 300) \u03bc \u03b7 \u03c43. Both in vitro and in vivo, trabecular bone structure is clearly visualized. Spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are sufficient to quantify 2-D microstructural parameters such as mean intercept length (MIL) or mean trabecular num ber (Tb.N). In the case o f the excised phalanx proximalis a MIL of (0.6 \u00b1 0.1) mm has been determ ined in the proximal part of the bone. M IL did not show significant anisotropy. Tb.N was (1.0 \u00b1 0.2) m m -1 a t this location. Conclusion: Trabecular bone structure can be investigated in vitro as well as in vivo, using standard clinical w hole-body MR-systems. Although spatial resolution and SNR were slightly reduced in the in vivo study to reduce acquisition time, quantification of m orphologic param eters such as M IL or Tb.N was feasible at the currently realized spatial resolution. This technique opens up new possibilities fo r studying osteoporosis o r osteoarthritis.16:50 684 Usefulness of calcaneal broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) in evaluating fracture risk in senile osteoporosis A. La Fianza, E. Taverna, E.M. Di Maggio, L. Preda, L. Madonia, R. Campani; Pavia/lPurpose: Vertebral collapse is a rather common com plication of senile osteo porosis with often severe sequels. We used broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) try to identify the subgroup of patients with atraum atic vertebral collapse in a series of patients with established senile osteoporosis. M aterialsand Methods: 184 patients with known senile osteoporosis were submitted to calcaneal BUA and dorsolum bar spine radiography; the body m ass index, postmenopausal and menopausal age w ere also calculated in all patients to define, with a multiple regression statistical analysis, the factor with the highest correlation with fractures. Results: The regression analysis showed a statistically significant role o f BUA (inverse correlation) and weight (direct correlation) in collapse risk assessment. ROC curves, with the patients subdivided by body mass index, helped increase test accuracy (BUA cut-off 45 MHz, 66.67% sensitivity, 71.43% specificity). Conclusion: Calcaneal BUA is a useful factor to predict atraum atic vertebral collapse in senile osteoporosis patients; when correlated with w eight factor, BUA helps distinguish this important subgroup.

Method: 44 veterans were included, mean age 73 (4 7-83 ) years: 15 (45%) above knee am putation (AKA); 29 (60%) below knee am putation (BKA). BMD measured by DXA (Lunar DPX-L) in spine and both hips (femoral neck, W ard's and trochanter). Hip joints were assessed and OA changes were graded according to the presence and severity of osteophytes, subchondral cysts, sclerosis and joint narrowing. Results: BMD was reduced (p < 0.0001) in all 3 sites in the fem ur on the side o f am putation, com pared to the non-am putated hip. Reduction in BMD was greater (p = 0.0027) in AKA than BKA. Prevalence o f O A was equal in both hips, but more severe on the non-am putated side and more frequent on the side of am putation in AKA than BKA (p = 0.00999). Conclusion: There is reduced bone mass in the hip as a consequence of am putation, greater in AKA than BKA. Prevalence of OA in the hip is similar on the am putated and non-am putated sides, but is more severe on the non-am putated side and more frequent in AKA.17:10 686 Bone m ineral density in secondary hyperparathyroidism: Com parison of four different methods E. Gorghi, P.M. Ulivieri, S. Tampellini, S. Superbi, F. De Finis, F. Vallino; Milan/I Purpose: To evaluate bone mineral status in secondary hyperparathyroidism (2HPTH), com paring pQCT with other methods (DXA, SXA, QUS).Methods and Materials: W e measured bone mineral density (BMD) in 14 uremic patients on chronic hemodialysis with 2HPTH (= intact PTH > 400 pg/ml), com paring the results obtained with four different methods, namely pQCT of the distal radius (Stratec-XCT-960, TOTal, TRABecular and CORTical BMD), whole-body and regional DXA (Hologic QDR 4500 -SUBtotal and Lum bar spine BMD), SXA of distal and ultradistal radius (Hologic DTX 100, D-and UD-BMD) and QUS of the calcaneus (CUBACIinical, broadband ultrasound attenuation, BUA). Results: TOT-BMD by pQ C T was highly correlated with SUB-BMD by DXA (r = 0.83, P < 0.001), D-and UD-BMD by SXA (r = 0.88 and 0.90, P < 0.001) and BUA by QUS (r = 0.84, P < 0.001). CORT-BMD was correlated with D-BMD (r = 0.81, P < 0.001), UD-BMD (r = 0.76, P < 0.005) and SUB-BMD (r = 0.71, P < 0.005) while TRAB-BMD was only significantly correlated with UD-BMD (r = 0.57, P < 0.05). CORT-BMD was also inversely correlated with alkaline phosphatase levels (r = -.5 9 , P < 0.05) C onclusions: pQCT can measure cortical and trabecular BMD separately, w hile DXA and SXA results prevalently reflect cortical bone which makes up most o f the skeleton. Patients with 2HPTH show a prevalent involvement of cortical bone.17Clinical body com position by DXA in ulcerative colitis: A controlled prospective study F.M. Ulivieri, D. Lisciandrano, T. Ranzi, S. Superbi, S. Tampellini, A. dal Lago, P. Cosmacini; Milan/I Purpose: To determ ine bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition in a selected series of patients with ulcerative colitis. Methods: 19 males (2 1 -4 9 yrs.) and 22 fem ales (2 3 -4 5 yrs) affected by ulcerative colitis underw ent total body, lean and fat measurement by DXA (Hologic QDR 1000/W) at baseline and after 1 yr. Healthy sex, age and body mass index m atched subjects served as controls. Statistical analysis was performed using the W ilcoxon and Spearman rank correlation test. Results: At baseline no differences were found in BMD between patients and their controls. In fem ales lean mass was significantly greater vs controls (38110 \u03c6 3165 vs 36165 \u03c8 3661 g, p = 0.03). After 1 yr there was a significant reduction respect to baseline in BMD both in males (1.113 =f 0.105 vs 1.108 =f 0.106 g/cm2, p = 0.01) and in fem ales (0.974 \u03c6 0.07 vs 0.966 \u03c8 0.08 g/cm2, p = 0.04). No correlation between BMD and steroid intake was found. Conclusions: In a selected group patients with ulcerative colitis we observed a significant decrease in bone density after 1 year of follow-up.Functional MR mammography: An integrated diagnostic concept M.V.

Oudkerk; Rotterdam/NL Purpose: To evaluate the role of MR mammography in our patient population as an extension o f the existing imaging modalities in the diagnosis o f breast cancer.Materials and Methods: MR mammography was performed in 54 patients with clinically and/or mammographically suspicious breast lesions the day prior surgery. The MR examination consisted o f a pre-contrast and post contrast STIR sequence (to suppress the signal from fat) and a dynamic T1-weigted 2D FLASH sequence prior and 1, 3 and 5 minutes after contrast administration. The MR results w ere com paired against the results of the clinical evaluation, X-ray mammography and ultrasonography and against the final histological diagnosis. In case the MR revealed additional lesions MR guided ultrasound and FNAB were performed. Results: MR mammography depicted 30 of the 33 malignancies (sensitivity 91%). In tw o of them the carcinoma w as clinically and mammographically occult. In 3 patients with a false negative MRI diagnosis, the conventional mammography showed clustered microcalcifications. In 7 patients MR incor rectly suggested the presence o f malignancy (specificity 67%). Conclusion: MR mammography has a high sensitivity but low specificity. In 15% of our patient population the information o f MR mammography and conventional X-ray was complementary. MR mammography had additional value in women with mammographie dense breast tissue and in patients with clinical evidence of breast carcinoma which could not be detected with conventional methods.Comparison o f dual-phase Spiral-CT (DPSCT) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in the preoperative evaluation of patients with chronic pancreatitis and suspected pancreatic neoplasms M.G. Henschel, K. Binmoeller, G. Krupski, V. Nicolas, C.H. Lund, D. Br\u00f6ring, N.N. Izbicki; Hamburg/D Purpose:To test the hypothesis that the invent o f spiral CT has markedly increased its accuracy for detection and staging in the preoperative evalu ation of patients with chronic pancreatic disease and suspected neoplasms compared with endoscopic ultrasound. Material and Methods: Approximately 120 patients with chronic pancreatic disease or suspected pancreatic neoplasm s are anually referred to our hospital for major pancreatic surgery. Since 7/96 all these patients are preoperatively evaluated with a DPSCT and EUS. Results: After the first 30 patients the results for DPSCT and EUS shows a sensitivity for malignancy of > 90% and a specifity of approxim ately 70% for both methods. In the whole preoperative staging according to the TNM-scheme DPSCT performs better than EUS. Conclusion: Spiral-CT of the pancreas performed in a state-of-the-art matter increases the diagnostic perform ance in patients with chronic pancreatitis and suspected neoplasms.16:05 703 Ductectatic m ucinous cystic neoplasm s of the pancreas: Evaluation with MR cholangiopancreatography H. Onaya, Y. Itai, M. Niitsu, Y. Saida, T. Ahmadi, J. Echigo; Tsukuba, Ibaraki/J Purpose: To describe magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) findings and its advantages in ductectatic mucinous cystic neoplasms of the pancreas. Materials and Methods: Nine patients underwent ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), axial T2-weighted MR imaging, MRCP, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The diagnosis was confirmed pathologically (\u043b = 4) or by the characteristic ERCP findings (\u043b = 5).Results: MRCP demonstrated the cystic lesions as a cluster of small cysts (\u043b = 6) o r as a multilobulated o r irregularly-marginated cyst (\u043b = 3). US, CT, and axial MR images also showed the lesions. ERCP showed the cystic lesion almost completely (\u043b = 6) or incom pletely (\u043b = 1) but failed to show it (\u043b = 2). The communicating duct between the cystic lesion and the main pancreatic duct was depicted by MRCP (\u043b = 3) and was more clearly seen by source coronal images of MRCP (\u043b = 9) and ERCP (\u043b = 5), while US, C T and axial MR images failed to dem onstrate it in eight patients. ERCP detected filling defects suggestive of mucin (\u043b = 8) w hich w as undetectable on MRCP. Conclusion: MRCP using both the projection and source images can demon strate the characteristic findings of this entity and verify the presence o f the communicating duct.16:15 704 Color and power Doppler ultrasound and spiral CT in the evaluation of vascular infiltration in pancreatic malignancy S.

Dalla Palma; Trieste/IThe term \"acute renal infection\" encom passes a spectrum o f pathologic processes involving the renal parenchyma that vary in severity from acute pyelonephritis to a renal abscess w hich can progress to the peri-and pararenal spaces. The clinical pattern of all the pathological variants is quite similar: therefore if it is easy to diagnose a renal infection, it is impossible to recognize the pathological variant and its extension. The imaging modalities may solve this problem. Most risk factors of acute renal infection can be elicited by a good clinical history and physical examination. Due to the low sensitivity of IVU, renal scintigraphy (99mTc-labelled DMSA) and US should be the first exam inations to be performed. Their limitations are due to the incomplete evaluation o f the process, mainly in cases of extrarenai extension. CT is the study of choice to define the pattern of renal involvement and extrarenai extension, intra-o r extrafascial. CT is also useful in understanding the pathophysiology o f the infection using precontrast and postcontrast, early and delayed scans. The imaging modalities are indicated:(1) when the disease is resistant to medical treatment (2) w hen predisposing factors are present (urinary tract stones, indwelling urinary catether, vesicoureteral reflux, neurogenic bladder, diabetes and immunodeficiency) (3) For follow-up under medical treatment (4) To guide drainage in com plicated cases which do not respond to antibiotic therapy.712 B. Children M.H. Smet; Leuven/B Urinary tract infections remain am ong the m ost common bacterial infections in children. Renal scarring from recurrent infection is an im portant cause of end-stage renal disease and hypertension in the pediatric population. Main risk factors fo r developm ent of pyelonephritic scarring are obstructive malformations, vesico-ureteral reflux, young age and delayed or insufficient therapy. Imaging diagnostic techniques are of param ount importance fo r evaluation of the child with urinary tract infection and identification o f those at risk for infection. Only early diagnosis and prompt institution of proper therapy reduce the likelihood of renal scarring and hence, improve child's outcome. In this course, the current status of the pathogenesis o f acute renal infection in children and available imaging m ethods will be discussed.

Bj\u00f6rnsson; Uppsala/S The purpose o f the study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy o f positron emission tom ography (PET) using 18Fluoro-deoxy-glucose (18FDG) and L-[m ethyl-H C ] methionine (11C-methionine) in comparison with CT and corre lated to the findings at surgery. Before open thoracotom y (n = 19) or biopsy (n = 1) PET was performed in 20 patients with non-small cell malignant (n = 17) o r benign (n = 3) tum ors in the lung o r mediastinum where 17 subjects were examined with both tracers.Standardized uptake values (SUV) and tracer transport rates were calculated and fo r tum our tissue corrected fo r partial volume effects. It was found that the tw o tracers equally well detected all tum ours as well as hilar invasion and mediastinal metastases. PET correctly excluded tum our spread in 15/20 patients and visualised dissem inated disease in 5 subjects whereas CT missed metastases in 2 subjects and was false positive in 1. Retrospective density corrected cut-off SUV and transport rate values differentiated malignant from benign lesions with an accuracy of 90% and 95% for each tracer individually and combined, respectively. In conclusion 18FDG-PET and 11C-methionine-PET performed equally well and better than CT and may serve as a com plement for the preparative decision in patients with tum ours in the lung and mediastinum.16:10 714 Chest wall invasion by lung cancer: Evaluation with inspiratory and expiratory spiral CT B.

C lose contact between cancer and vascular structures was showed in 24 patients that were then double-checked by MR. MR study w as made with T1 and T2 images and with Turbo-FLASH sequences in choiced planes. Results: In 23 out of 24 patients MR exams showed a subtle sheam of fat tissue between the neoplasm and suspected involved vascular structure. These evidences were confirmed by surgery.

Obstructions of the large femoral veins and the pelvic veins are usually secondary to deep vein thrombosis or surgery and traum a. The M ay-Thurner-syndrome is a further cause for pelvic vein stenosis, usually on the left and preferably involving the female sex. All these entities are excellent indications fo r stent treatment. Results and conclusions: Initial success after stent treatm ent fo r benign obstruction of the V. cava, brachiocephalic and pelvic veins can be expected in 8 0 -1 0 0 % . Long time patency rate has been excellent in our own experience, particularly fo r pelvic vein obstruction (100%, mean follow up 34 months). Also in the literature, though few longtime follow-up reports are available, high longtime patency rates in the V. cava and the iliofemoral veins are reported. Patients treated fo r brachiocephalic vein stenosis in hemodialysis fistulas show very good initial results, however recurrent stenosis has to be expected in 6 0 -8 0 % o f the cases.

Methods and Materials: the main orbital vessels o f 7 patients with clinical and angiographic diagnosis of IAVF (4 high blood flow IAVF, 3 low blood flow IAVF) were examined by GDI. The vessels considered were: superior ophthalm ic vein, central retinal vein and artery, ophthalm ic artery, ciliary artery. W e have studied the caliber of each vessel, the direction of blood flow and the following flow parameters: maximum and minimum velocities fo r veins; peak systolic, end diastolic velocities and resistive index fo r arteries. Results: GDI demonstrated a superior ophthalm ic vein dilated, with low resistance, arterialized and reversal blood flow in 4 high-flow IAVF; no flow changes were found in the other orbital vessels. No significant flow changes were observed in 3 low -flow IAVF. Conclusion: GDI allows an accurate diagnosis in high-flow IAVF (superior ophthalm ic vein dilated, with arterialized and reversal blood flow ), while pro viding poor informations in low-flow IAVF.

Balloon dacryocystoplasty was attempted in 37 eyes with incomplete and 67 eyes with com plete obstruction including six eyes with anastom otic obstruc tions after failed surgery. The site of obstructions were common canaliculus (n = 11), junctional area including sac and proximal lacrimal duct (n = 77) o r distal lacrimal duct (n = 10). A plastic arterial sheath, 0.016 in. guide-wire and a low-profile angioplasty balloon catheter (20 x 4 mm) were used for dilatation. Results: Technical success w as achieved in all 31 eyes with incomplete and in 50 o f 67 eyes with com plete obstruction. Improvement in epiphora and overall patency rate in a follow -up period o f 1 3 -3 8 months was 81% for incomplete and 40% fo r com plete obstructions. No major com plications occurred in any patient. Conclusion: Balloon dacryocystoplasty is a seriuos alternative to surgical treatm ent fo r incomplete obstructions. It has a high failure and reccurence rate fo r com plete obstructions but selected cases can be relieved. M. BLERY (Le Kremlin-Bic\u00eatre/F) 754 A. Imaging of the oesophagus and stomach R.A.

Herewith, we like to present an update o f our results, now, with a substantial num ber of patients with a follow-up of more than 5 years allowing a more profound evaluation of factors governing success and failure. Results of Stenting: Technical success in 140/141 patients; drop of mean transstenotic gradient from an average of 29.4 to 1.4 mm Hg; 5 major complications; initial clinical success in 139/141 including successful repair o f unrelated peripheral lesions in 18 patients; cum ulative 5-year angiographic patency rate 91.6%, clinical success rate 90.7% , respectively; 4 late failures as a result of rapidly progressing lesions proximal or distal to the stented segm ent leading to late stent occlusion.

Early success, longterm success, com plication and patency rates are significantly better after stenting with p values < 0.0 1-0 .005 . In the PTA group distal iliac artery lesions were more prone to failure than proximal lesions (p < 0.03).Conclusion:The higher m orphologic and clinical benefit after primary stenting seem to result from less technical failures and, more important, from better morphologic repair as com pared to balloon angioplasty. 761 B.

This presentation focus on the role of imaging in the diagnostic approach of me diastinal masses in an adult population. Chest radiograph remains the first modality performed in the detection of mediastinal abnorm alities but specific clinical situations lead to further imaging evaluation. C om puted tom ography especially with spiral acquisition is today the next step with a high powerful role in characterization and planning therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, and thransthoracic needle biopsies have specific indications. Dif ferential diagnosis is presented according to the main imaging findings as fatty, cystic solid and vascular masses.763 Imaging of the m ediastinal vessels D. Hahn; Wurzburg/D MRI of the mediastinal vessels is very well established since many years. MR-imaging of the mediastinum already allowed a very good evaluation of diseases of the thoracic vessels using spin-echo sequences. Especially diseases of the thoracic aorta, inflammatory as well as degenerative changes, can be evaluated with a very high diagnostic accuracy. Mediastinal veins were causing more problem s because of the slow flow. The imaging quality of the pulmonary arteries is beating all other conventional or digital imaging procedures. The improvement of MR, especially of MR-Angiography, nowadays allows an excellent imaging of the mediastinal arteries and veins in a 3-D-mode. For 3-D-imaging of the thoracic vessels normally tim e-of-flight techniques are applied. Phase contrast sequences should be the prim ary method used, if blood flow measurements are requested. The additional use of paramagnetic contrast medium can improve the signal to noise ratio and the imaging quality. Most of these examinations can be done in breathhold-technique. Conclusion: MRI and MRA nowadays should be the primary methods for the evaluation of diseases of the thoracic vessels. Especially MRA can provide functional data in thoracic aneurysm s and stenoses. Invasive examinations should only be done if MR is not able to establish a correct diagnosis. Diagnosis and treatm ent of cerebral AVM A. Valavanis; Zurich/CH",

Depending on the postoperative course CT examinations are done thrice on an average. T his study was conducted to determ ine the value of US in follow -up o f postoperative brain in patients using the decompressive craniotom y as acoustic window. The findings w ere compared with CT. Methods and Materials: In 48 patients at an age of 1 7 -7 6 141 C T and 152 US examinations were performed with a real time sector scanner system (Sonoline DX, Siemens -3.5 MHz) over a postoperative period between two days and 11 months. Results: In 39 patients with regular postoperative course we positively cor related edema and hygroma with CT findings visualizing ventricular size and configuration, midline shifts, fluid collections, cyst malformation, echogenecity and brain pulsation. In nine cases with clinical fall-back we correctly diag nosed a postoperative bleeding in four of five cases, an em pyem a in both and ischemia in all three cases.

Methods and Materials: Seven patients with angiographically proved spinal artero-venous m alform ations were included in the study. They underwent Gd-DTPA enhanced MR angiography (Signa 1.5 T, GE/Medical Systems) with the 3-D phase contrast technique and phase difference reconstruction. Images acquired have been processed with a SunSparc workstation (Advantage W indows, GE/Medical Systems), using the Voxtool software. The first step was volum e rendering of data to enhance pixels with Maximum and Minimum Intensity Projection algorithm s (MIP and MinIP). The second step w as to select the pixels enhanced with a thresholding segmentation. The relative voxels were rendered to obtain a 3D solid model of the malformation. Results: The 3D models obtained with the thresholding selection provided useful information about the anatom y o f the spinal vascular malformations.

Bjerknes; Oslo/N Purpose: To assess the diagnostic efficacy, safety and tolerability of MnDPDP in liver MRI. Materials and Methods: Two open Phase III, non-com parative, studies in 624 adult patients were performed using lesion count as main parameter. Patients with 1 -5 liver lesions were included in the study. To evaluate safety and tolerability, patients were followed fo r 24 hours, and adverse events w ere recorded, a total of 621 patients w ere imaged before and after the administration o f MnDPDP at a dose o f 5 \u03bc mol/kg b.w. T 1 -weighted SE and GE sequences and a T2-weighted SE sequence were performed pre-contrast; the T1-W sequences were repeated post-contrast. Results: Comparing the maximum num ber o f lesions seen post-versus pre-MnDPDP, more were seen post-MnDPDP in 17% o f the patients. The differ ence in the favour o f the post-examination was statistically significant (p = 0.0001, McNemar test), although the T2-weighted sequence w as not repeated post-contrast in m ost patients. Of the 624 patients who received MnDPDP, 26 (4%) experienced infusion-associated discom fort and 46 patients (7%) reported a total of 63 adverse events. Only 16 of these events were related to MnDPDP. Conclusion: The results show that MnDPDP is safe and well tolerated and useful for detecting additional liver lesions.

Bamberger, I.S. Leichter, \u0412. Novak; Jerusalem /ILPurpose: To determ ine if discriminant analysis applied to com puter extracted quantitative features of clustered micro-calcifications (CMC), on digitized screen-film mammograms, can be used as a classifier. Materials and Methods: Using pathology records, archival cases o f biopsy proven CMC identified on screen-film mammogram s were sequentially chosen fo r analysis. Seventy-seven cases were included, 37 benign and 40 malignant. The area of abnormality was identified by an experienced m am m ographer and this region was digitized to 0.04 mm pixel and 8 bit depth, using a flat bed CCD scanner. A software program was developed to allow the m am m ographer to interactively target the individual calcifications on the digital image. The software automatically extracted features characterizing both the individual micro-calcifications and the structure o f the cluster as a whole. The most significant features were used for pattern recognition based on discrim inant analysis. Each case was classified using the Jack-Knife technique. ROCanalysis was used to evaluate the performance of the procedure. Results: Eight parameters were found to be significantly related to the biopsy results (p < 0.005). The area under the ROC curve was 0.875. Conclusion: Pattern recognition using autom atically extracted quantitative features fo r CMC on screen-film mammograms, w as found to be a useful method for classification.10:45 871 Autom atic detection of clustered m icrocalcifications in digitized mamm ograms T. Netsch, C.J.G. Evertsz, H. Juergens, H.-O. Peitgen; Brem en/D Purpose: A novel, straightforward method fo r the autom atic detection of clustered microcalcifications in digitized mammogram s is proposed and its performance com pared to a well-established Bayesian approach. Material and Methods: The detection scheme uses a multiscale analysis based on the Laplacian-of-Gaussian and a m athem atical model describing a microcalcification as a bright spot o f certain size and contrast. For the evalu ation of the detection performance the method is applied to 40 mammogram s (Nijmegen database, 100 micron pixel size, 105 clusters marked by expert radiologists, images are rescaled to equalize image noise). R esults are pre sented in FROG curves plotting the num ber of true positive detections as a function o f the false positive detections. The FROG curves are com pared to the results o f a Bayesian approach using the same database. Results: Both methods have a com parable detection perform ance even though fundam ental different approaches are used. The multiscale m ethod is simpler and does not rely on additional training images. Conclusion: The rather simple multiscale method discussed here performs very well, com pared to a more elaborated approach. There is still potential for improvement by a further differentiation o f the findings and an enhanced clustering scheme. 10:55 872 Autom atic detection of m icrocalcification clusters after lossy com pression o f digitized mamm ograms T.

Materials and Methods: Digital thorax images (FCR A C -1, Fuji Film, Japan) with discrete radiologic symptoms of pulm onary congestion were obtained from a standard hospital population. Together with digital thorax images w ithout pathology the images w ere compressed 1:2, 1:12 and 1:20 and archived on optical disc (ODF, Fuji Film, Japan). A hard-copy was made of each com pression and divided into tw o hemi-thorax images resulting in a collection o f 294 images. 10 radiologists and senior-residents were asked to observe the presence of broadening of cranial vasculature, unscharpness and broadening of central vasculature, indistinctness of peripheral vessels and interstitial changes such as Kerley b lines. Answers were rated according to a five point confidence scale and analysed by ROC methods. A gold standard was established by two senior radiologists with access to all clinical data and pre-and post therapeutic images. Results: The com pression algorithm s used in our study did not lead to loss in diagnostic capability in the detection of the above mentioned discrete signs of pulm onary congestion.

Bartolozzi; Pisa/I Purpose: To compare dual-phase spiral CT with spiral C T follow ing intraarterial injection of Lipiodol (Lipiodol-CT) fo r detecting intrahepatic metastatic nodules of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods and Materials: Requirements fo r entering this prospective study were the following: a) adult patient with histologically-proven HCC sched uled for treatment o f the tum or with transcatheter arterial chem oem bolization (TACE); b) gray-scale US showing a single main hepatic lesion; c) no previous treatm ent fo r HCC. Twenty-five consecutive patients w ere included in the study and underwent evaluation with dual-phase spiral-CT and Lipiodol-CT. In dual-phase CT, hepatic arterial-dom inant phase images were obtained at 2 5 -3 0 s, and portal venous-dom inant images at 6 5 -7 0 s. Lipiodol-C T scans were obtained 4 weeks after intra-arterial injection of 1 0 -2 0 ml Lipiodol mixed with 50 mg epirubicin and followed by gelatine sponge particles. Results: Intrahepatic metastatic nodules of HCC were detected at Lipiodol-CT in 11 of 25 patients; an overall num ber o f 28 satellite lesions 0 .5 -1 .8 cm in diam eter was identified. At biphasic spiral-CT, intrahepatic metastatic nodules were depicted in 10 of the 11 patients (91%), and 22 o f the 28 (78%) satellite lesions were identified. Hepatic arterial-dom inant phase imaging was significantly superior (P < 0.01) to portal venous-dom inant phase imaging. Conclusion: Biphasic spiral-CT approaches the sensitivity of Lipiodol-CT for detecting intrahepatic metastatic nodules of HCC, and may reduce the need for angiographically assisted CT.10:50881 Hepatic lesion detection on dual-phase spiral CT: Sensitivity of non-contrast, arterial and portalvenous phase com pared with spiral-CTAP S. Puig, W.l. Dock, F. Grabenw\u00f6ger, R. Dorffner, K. Eibenberger, G.

Patients and Methods: 35 patients with suspected primary and secondary liver tum ors were examined with both DSCT (150 ml nonionic contrast medium, flow: 5 ml/sec., delay: 30 sec) and SCTAP (100 ml nonionic contrast medium, flow: 4 ml/sec., delay: 25 sec) of the liver. Results: SCTAP revealed 96 lesions in the 35 patients. 68 lesions (70.8%) were detected with DSCT. W e diagnosed 30 lesions (31%) in the non-contrast scan, 58 lesions (60%) in the arterial phase and 59 lesions (61%) in the portalvenous phase. All lesions, w hich had been seen in the non-contrast scan, were also diagnosed in the arterial or portalvenous phase. Excluding small lesions (diam eter of < 10 mm), SCTAP revealed 51 lesions. W ith DSCT 29 lesions (57%) were detected in the non-contrast scan, 48 (94%) in the arterial phase and 47 (92%) in the portalvenous phase. Conclusion: Non contrast scans are not necessary to improve sensitivity on hepatic lesion detection with DSCT. However, the overall sensitivity of DSCT com pared with SCTAP is low er than we expected.11:00 882 Value of triphasic CT of the liver in the characterisation of incidental hepatic lesions on ultrasound M.P. van Proosdij, M.S. van Leeuwen, J.

M a terialsand Methods: 177 lesions that were detected on ultrasound in 51 consecutive patients without chronic liver disease o r known primary tu mour were analysed. CT comprised non-enhanced, arterial, portal and late equilibrium phase images. Characterisation was considered to be diagnostic when all lesions m et the criteria of typical haemangiom a, cyst, FNH, focal steatosis o r showing solid liver lesions in the presence of a prim ary abdominal tumour. Results: Conclusive characterisation was obtained in 134 of 177 lesions: 29 haemangiomas, 40 cysts, 10 FNH, 2 focal steatosis, 43 hypovascular lesions in a patient with a gastric abnorm ality suspect for carcinom a and 10 hypo-and hypervascular lesions in a patient with a typical carcinoid lesion.

Methods: 17 volunteers and 15 patients were studied by T2 TSE FSAT se quence transversal pre-contrast) and T1 Flash 3D -sequence transversal after 3 eyedrops of Gadolinium (1:100 diluted solution) into each eye (TE 15/10 msec, TR 2200/22 msec, eff. STh 3/1 .5 mm, FOV 290/140 mm), on a 1.5 T Magnetom Vision (Siemens, Erlangen, 5 inch surface-coil). In volunteers 3D reconstructions w ere made using a maximum intensity projection enhancing al gorithm (MIP). Canaliculi, saccus and nasolacrim al-duct were tried to be iden tified. The drainage of the Gadolinium eye-drop solution was judged. Patho logic alterations in patients (i.e. stenosis, occlusion, mucocele) were classi fied/localized com pared to conventional dacryocystography, as any abnorm al ities o f surrounding tissue (i.e. septum deviation, polyps or mucoid masses). Results: Quality and contrast w as good in all volunteers. Contrast in patients was poor, 2 stenoses (1 occlusion) were overestimated. The MIP images proved to be helpful only for getting an overview o f the lacrimal system. The surrounding anatom ical structures were visualized in both sequences. The post-contrast sequence yielded a better depiction o f the lacrimal-duct. Conclusion: M R-Dacryocystography potentially provides im portant clinical information about the lacrimal drainage system.

The effect and damage of falanga torture (FT) on the thickness and structure o f the subcutis (SC) and planter aponeurosis (PA) were studied by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods and Materials: MRI of 16 feet of victims submitted to FT were compared with 5 healthy volunteers (HV). MR imaging were performed using a 1.5 Tesla Philips Gyroscan ACS-NT. Sagittal I T1-weighted SE (T1-wi), T2weighted SE (T2-wi) and short T1 Inversion Recovery (STIR) fat suppression were obtained Results: On T1-wi the PA was thicker in victim s after FT com pared with that of HV in the midfoot (p = 0.002) and in the forefoot (P = 0.01 ), but not in the heelpads (P = 0.12). No difference were found on the thickness and structure of SC.Conclusion: MRI may prove a clinically useful measure of the damaged after falanga torture on the PA.

Methods and Materials: We developed a phantom with different Gd-concentrations to measure the dynamic signal enhancement o f an examination. Nine MRscanners o f the manufacturers Bruker, Philips and Siemens (m agnetic field strengths from 0.2 to 2.0 T) were com pared with the phantom under identical measurement conditions. The measurements were performed on each scan ner with six different sequence types and parameters fo r the repetition-time, echo-time and flip-angle. Results: Under same measurement conditions different characteristics in signal enhancement exist on different scanners, even at the same magnetic field strength. Most of the differences can only be explained by the varying measurement designs despite using the same sequence-type name and parameters at the scanners.

Methods and Materials: 23 Patients with microcalcification clusters suspicious for malignancy detected by mammography underwent dynamic gadolinium enhanced 1.5 T MRM (Gd-DTPA 0.2 mmol/kg body weight) performed using a double phased array breast coil, with FAST 2D or 3D SPGR sequences, before open biopsy. Lesion enhancement was evaluated with qualitative and quantitative analysis. Size and morphology of the enhanced lesions was compared with the data obtained by mammography and histology. Results: 13/23 lesions identified by mammography were histologically malig nant, and 10/23 were benign. MRM correctly identified 10/23 of these lesions: 7 malignant and 3 benign; moreover, 4 other lesions, not recognized by mam mography, and benign at the histologic evaluation, were detected.

Tseng, M.M.-T. Teng; Taipei/RC Purpose:To evaluate the accuracy of staging rectal carcinomas by comparing fast SE T2-weighted im ages with serial GRE images and SE T1 -weighted images after Gadolinium-DTPA administration. Materials and Methods: Twenty-one patients with rectal carcinoma underwent preoperative MR imaging using either pelvic array coil in 12 o r endorectal coil in nine patients (5T1, 5T2, 11T3). FSE T2-weighted images, serial fast spoiled GRE technique (FA 60\u00b0, TR 100 msec, TE 3.6 msec) following Gd-DTPA injection a t 45 sec, 100 sec, 145 sec and SE T1-weighted images three minutes after Gd-DTPA injection were obtained. Results: The tum or w as markedly enhanced in early phase and became less enhanced than the m uscular layer during late phase. Necrotic o r mucinous com ponent of the tum or w as poorly enhanced. The tum or infiltration was correctly staged in 76.2% by FSE T2-weighted images alone. Gadoliniumenhanced MR images were less demarcated in seven patients and revised the preoperative staging in one T2 lesion. Conclusions: Fast SE T2-weighted imaging is sufficient fo r assessing the depth o f tum or infiltration in rectal carcinoma.

Kremser, T. Gneiting, J. Griebel, W. Judmaier, F. Aichner, W. Jaschke, P. Lukas; Innsbruck/A Purpose: Tum or microcirculation is an im portant factor in the therapeutic deci sion o f malignant neoplasms. Especially the timing of adjuvant chemotherapy w ould profit of exact data about tum or perfusion changes under radiation. An ultrafast T1-m apping technique was applied on a whole body MRI-scanner and evaluated fo r its feasibility fo r assessment of microcirculatory changes during fractionated radiation. Method: Patients with histologically proven rectal carcinoma undergoing a standardized fractionated radiation scheme were included in the study. On a 1.5 T w hole body MR-scanner (Magnetom VISION, Siemens, Erlangen, Ger many) a snapshot-FLASH sequence with a 180\u00b0 non selective inversion pulse and 16 T1 -weighted im ages within 4 seconds was applied after intravenous injection of 0.05 mmol/kg GD-DTPA. This sequence was repeated in constant intervals over a tim espan of 40 minutes. Under assumption of a linear correla tion between the relaxation time (R1 = 1/T1) and the GD-DTPA concentration tum or perfusion w as calculated. Results: Even minimal changes of tum or perfusion are reliably assessed with this method. Furthermore a characteristic time course in the perfusion changes under radiation w as noticed. Conclusion: U ltrafast snapshot-FLASH T1 -mapping techniques can be imple mented on a whole body MR-scanner and are well suited to assess changes in tissue microcirculation. This novel approach offers better data fo r planning o f com bined radiochem otherapy o f malignant neoplasms.14:35 938 Rectal cancer: Staging with phased-array external body coil A. Zanello, A.

Felix; Berlin/DPurpose: This study was designed to evaluate the accuracy by endorectal contrast enhanced MRI in the diagnosis of rectal carcinoma and adenoma with surgical pathologic correlation. Materials and Methods: Endorectal MRI was performed in 35 patients with different rectal tum ors with a 1.5 Tesla SP 63 Magnetom. The plain protocol included a T2-weighted (w) spinecho (SE) (TR/TE = 25 00/2 2-9 0), a Turbo-SE (3700/90) and a T1w SE (700/15) sequence. Dynam ic MRI was performed using a TurboFLASH sequence (TR/TE/TI = 7/3/300, flip angle = 15\") using a bolus injection of 0.1 mmol/kg b.w. Gd-DTPA. Result: In 15 patients, histopathology revealed a tubulo-villous adenoma, 6 patients presented a rectal carcinoma stage pT1, 5 patients stage pT2, 5 patients stage pT3, and 4 patients were staged as pT4. The endorectal MR imaging stage agreed with the staging results from pathology in 30 of 35 (85%) cases. The extent o f invasion was overstimated in 4 cases with endorectal MR imaging (2 tubulo-villous adenomas, 1 T1 and 1 T2 lesions were overstaged). However endorectal MR imaging was excellent fo r depicting perirectal lymph nodes as small as 3 mm in diameter, inflam matory nodes could not be differentiated from metastatic nodes on the basis o f size or signal intensity. Conclusion: Endorectal contrast-enhanced MRI appears to be very promising fo r accurate preoperative staging and evaluation of rectal lesions. The use of the dynam ic TurboFLASH sequence w as helpful in the differentiation between tum or stage T2 and T3.14:50 940 CT and MR findings in the preoperative staging of rectal carcinoma S. Cappabianca, L. Carpinelli, M.L. Mangoni di S. Stefano, A.M. Addesso, D. lasevoli, A. Del Vecchio; Naples/I Purpose: Aim of the study is to evaluate MR and C T findings, with pathosurgical correlations in rectal carcinoma. Methods and Materials: From January 1994 to march 1996 157 patients with assessed rectal carcinoma, were studied with C T and MR. CT: Thin and contigous slices both in supine and prone position after insufflaction of rectal lumen; MR: T 1w images in all orthogonal planes and PD-T2w images both in sagittal and transaxial planes. Evaluation o f images was performed by 2 groups of experienced radiologist and com paired with patho-surgical findings. CT and MR findings w ere divided in 2 groups: A: Increased wall thickness without perivisceral fat involvement; B: Increased wall thickness with involvement of perivisceral fat with or without extension to contigous anatom ical structures. Results: GROUP A: Comparable CT an MR findings, a specific for T * stage of neoplasm; C T and MR versus surgery: low sensibility and specificity. GROUP B: High sensibility and specificity of MR findings, com paired to CT, in the evaluation o f fat involvement and contigous anatom ical structures infiltration; CT vs surgery sensibility 76% , specificity 52%, MR vs surgery sensibility 89%, specificity 84%.

The algorythm of application of irradiative m ethods of investigation in early diagnostics of rectal cancer recurrence I. Dykan; Kiev/UKR Purpose: The prognosis fo r rectal cancer patients is related closely to the extent of tum or a t the time of diagnosis, and early detection of metastatic or recurrent disease in an im portant prerequisite for successful treatment. Methods and Materials: Using RIA (CEA, AFP, TRA, \u0421 \u0410 19.9) US and CT we followed up 358 patients after radical treatm ent of rectal cancer. The principal treatment modality w as surgery, while 75 patients received combined or complex therapy. Results: Recurrent rectal cancer was diagnosed in 116 cases. These in cluded 11% local relapses, 68% metachronous metastasing. In 21% patients local rectal cancer relapses developed in com bination with lymphogenic and hematogenous methastazing. The final diagnosis was based on surgical speseimens in all 116 cases. Conclusion: The using of RIA CEA, AFP, TPA and \u0421\u0410 19.9 on the first step of diagnostics in 89% cases provides screening o f patients whom have to be clinically investigated. Visualisation of recidives and methastases of colon cancer in 70 .2-98.6% cases is possible on the second and third steps of diagnostics by the complex: US, fibrocolonoscopy (II step) and CT (III step). Diagnostic laparotomy is recommended on the fourth step.15:10 942 Endorectal coil MR im aging and transrectal ultrasonography in the evaluation and staging of rectal cancer R.F. Grasso, E. lannicelli, A. Scipioni, \u0421. Catalano, A. Laghi, V. Panebianco, P. Pavone, R. Passariello; Rom e/lPurpose: to compare the accuracy of endorectal MR imaging to that of transrectal ultrasonography. Materials and Methods: fourteen patients with rectal cancer (n = 14) were studied with both tecniques. Sagittal T1W SE (TR = 320, TE = 12, matrix 203 X 256, FOV = 120, thk = 5 mm, gap 0.5 mm) and T2W (TR = 3000, TE = 120, ETL = 19) axial, sagittal and coronal images were obtained with a 0.5 T with 15 mT/m gradients power by using an endorectal coil. In six patient post-contrast (Gd-DTPA) T1W scan were also performed, with and without fat-suppression. Transrectal ultrasonography was then performed in each patient with use of 7.5 Mhz linear probe. Results: both tecniques were performed with no complications. The staging accuracy of MR with endorectal coil was sim ilar to endorectal ultrasonog raphy (81%). MR showed higher accuracy in the detection of perirectal limphadenopaty. Conclusion: This study show a high accuracy in the preoperative staging of rectal cancer by using both tecniques. MR may provide more information in the preoperative staging of patient with rectal cancer, by using both endorectal coil and body coil, fo r the evaluation of liver and abdominopelvic nodes.15:20 943 Com parison between contrast enhanced endorectal MRI and transrectal US for posttherapeutical staging of rectal lesions versus histopathology W.

We perform ed biopsies percutaneous drainages, MR controlled laserablations of tumors, MR guided core decom pressions in avascular necrosis, and MR guided breast lesion markings. The guidance and control of all procedures w as performed under X-ray fluoroscopy and/or MR imaging. Fast gradient echo techniques (Turbo FFE) were applied. Sequences were started from a panel at the MR imager, and im ages were displayed immediately on tw o LCD displays at the magnet. Results: The combination of MRI and X-ray fluoroscopy w as successful in all cases and no com plications occurred. All diagnostic procedures resulted in definitive pathohistologic diagnosis, as all therapeutic interventions (drainages, laserablations, and core decompressions) were successful in term s o f healing or palliation.

Bakker, R.M. Hoogeveen, W. Hurtak, J.J. van Vaals, M.A. Viergever, W.P.T.M. Mali; Utrecht/NL Purpose: To develop dedicated catheters and real-time scan techniques fo r MR-guided vascular interventions. Materials and Methods: Conventional catheters were adapted to the needs of susceptibility-based MR visualization by incorporating param agnetic rings into their wall. Near real-time imaging was accomplished by a keyhole-accelerated 2D gradient echo technique with a temporal resolution of 2 images/sec. Catheter manipulations were monitored by continuously com puting the differ ence in signal intensity between subsequent dynam ic images and a previously acquired reference image. Results: Experiments with pulsatile flow phantoms showed that proper modi fication of the magnetic properties o f catheters allowed their conspicuous and consistent visualization in subsecond 2D gradient echo images. The clinical feasibility of the resultant setup was demonstrated by simple catheterization experiments in the peripheral veins o f healthy volunteers.Conclusion:The magnetic properties o f catheters can be adapted so as to enable passive tracking of catheter manipulations by near real-time 2D scan techniques. Passive tracking allows visualization of the entire prepared part of the catheter, does not invoke safety o r steerability problem s and is, therefore, expected to provide a valuable adjunct to active tracking for guiding MRI-guided interstitial cryotherapy with a nitrogen supplied cryoprobe J.

Mack, T.J. Vogl, J.O. Balzer, R. Hammerstingl, W. Regios, H. Lobbeek, R. Felix; Berlin/D Purpose: To assess the precision and clinical value of MR-guided biopsies o f soft tissue tum ors of the liver and the head and neck region, which were only visible on MR images, using a conventional MR-unit and MR compatible needles.Methods and Materials: MR-guided biopsies were performed on 21 patients (16 liver lesions, 5 head and neck tum ors) under local anesthesia. All biopsies were perform ed at a conventional 1.5 Tesla MR-unit. FLASH-2D gradient echo sequences (acquisition-time: 17 sec.) were used fo r lesion and needle localization. A 15 and 20 cm manual rotation biopsy canula, a 15 cm aspiration canula, and a MR-biopsy gun was used for biopsy (Somatex, Berlin, Germany). All canulas were MR compatible. Results: All lesions were identified in previous plain and contrast enhanced MRI studies, while the identification was impossible in ultrasound o r CT examinations. In 20 patients the MR guided biopsy revealed sufficient material fo r obtaining a definite histopathological analysis: HCC (n = 8), cholangio-Ca (n = 3), regenerating nodule (n = 2), FNH (n = 2), lymph node metastases (n = 2), squam ous cell carcinoma (n = 3). In one patient a second MR guided biopsy w as necessary due to inadequate material for the differentiation HCC versus regenerating nodules. Clinically no com plications occurred. Post-interventional imaging revealed some bleeding in the area of the capsule in tw o patient after biopsy of a HCC nodule.Conclusion: The results of our study prove that MR-guided biopsies are also feasible with som ewhat increased time consumption on conventional MR units.

Lim; Seoul/RO K Purpose: To assess the thin-section com puted tom ography (CT) findings of squalene aspiration pneumonia.Methods and Materials:Thin-section CT w as obtained in 24 patients with proven exogenous lipoid pneum onia resulting from aspiration of squalene (derived from Shark liver oil). Diagnosis w as made by biopsy (n = 10), bronchoalveolar lavage (n = 8), o r sputum cytology and clinical history (n = 6). The clinical history of taking squalene was confirmed in all patients. C T findings were classified into three patterns of diffuse ground-glass attenuation, dense consolidation and interstitial thickening. Distribution o f the lesion, duration of taking Squalene, the am ount o f Squalene, predisposing factors fo r aspiration and the route o f administration of each pattern w ere analyzed. Results: Nine cases showing the pattern of ground-glass attenuation usually had predisposing conditions of unconciousness, pharyngeal dysmotility, or motor disturbances and had the recent history o f taking the large amount of squalene through nasal route. In these cases, ground-glass attenuation predom inantly involved dependant portion of the lung and involved nearly whole lung field in four cases. Six cases of the pattern of dense consolidation had history o f taking squalene at three o r four month ago and do not have any predisposing factor. Nine cases o f the pattern o f interstitial thickening had relatively longer history of taking squalene than six months, and showed segmental distribution of interstitial thickening with small areas of interposing ground-glass opacity. Conclusion: We could conclude that squalene aspiration pneumonia can be reliably diagnosed by the patterns on thin-section CT with appropriate historical inquiries.15:20 962 Lung injury caused by sauropus androgynus: CT findings M.-S.

Pozzi-Mucelli; Trieste/I Purpose:To assess the presence of microscopic lesions in the normal appearing white matter of MS patients. Methods and Materials: 71 patients with clinical definite MS (47 with RR course, 10 with CPI course and 14 with CPU course) and 57 healty volunteers underwent MR examination. MR images were obtained using a 1.5 T Philips Gyroscan ACS II magnet. MT ratios (I-I mt)/I were measured in 13 areas of normal appearing white matter. MT ratios in the same areas in healthy volunteers were considered. Results: The mean MTR of normal appearing white matter in patients was lower than that o f control subjects. A statistically significant difference (p < 0 .0001) was obtained in the cerebral peduncles between normal subjects and CPU patients. MTR's where different in three groups between occipital and frontal white matter, in particular when RR and CPU forms were compared.Conclusions: The evaluation of MTR's in the normal appearing white matter in patients with MS can be helpful in detection of MS microscopic lesions. Moreover, MTR evaluation could allowed a differentation between the different MS forms. Two year follow-up of MS plaques on MRI during 2-CDA treatm ent M. Bekiesiriska-Figatowska, J. Walecki, Z.

Material: 81 patients with MS underwent serial MR exam inations o f the brain over the course of tw o year treatm ent with 2-CDA and placebo. MRI was carried out twice in 81 patients, three tim es -in 66: before and after 6 and 12 courses o f treatment. Method: Studies were performed on Toshiba 0.5 T machine, in spin echo sequences, T1-, PD-and T2-weighted images in axial plane. Results: After the first 6 courses of treatm ent the num ber of new plagues was twice as big in placebo group than in 2-CDA group. The tw o groups o f patients were then crossed. On the third MRI the incidence o f new plaques was much higher (13) in the group that received placebo first and 2-CD A subsequently than in the second group of patients (2-CDA first) -5.

Losseff, J. Valk; Amsterdam/NL Purpose:To study the relative value o f various MR imaging criteria at first presentation predicting conversion to clinically definite multiple sclerosis (MS). Materials and Methods: Seventy-four patients with clinically isolated neuro logical symptoms suggestive o f MS were studied with MR. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis was used to determine the optimum cut-off point fo r each criterion, and logistic regression to remove redundant information and built a diagnostic model. Results: Clinically definite MS developed in 33 patients (prevalence 45%). The median follow -up in those patients not converting was 39 months. All MR vari ables were dichotom ized at the optim um cut-off (9 for total number of lesions, 3 fo r periventricular lesions, 1 for most others). Forward logistic regressions analysis showed that only gadolinium enhancement and juxtacortical lesions provided independent information fo r conversion to MS. Since backwards analysis in addition identified infratentorial and periventricular lesions, a final model w as built using 4 variables, which had a strongly positive predictive value (92% ) fo r conversion to clinically definite MS (Mantel-Haenszel, p < 0 .000001).Conclusion: A 4 param eter dichotomized model including gadolinium en hancement, juxtacortical, infratentorial and periventricular lesions strongly predicts conversion to MS. 14:35 969 The effect of training on reporting gadolinium-enhancing MS lesions F.

Following consensus reading, guidelines to identify enhancement were form ulated and a second independent reading w as performed after 3 m onths to examine training effect. Results: Initially, the experienced readers showed higher kappa-values for num ber of baseline lesions (0.64 vs 0.37), and fo r new (0.71 vs 0.54) and persistent (0.49 vs 0.35) lesions at follow-up. The second reading showed higher kappa values in the unexperienced group fo r baseline (0.65), new (0.75) and persistent (0.56) lesions (p < 0.05 fo r baseline and new lesions; p = 0.2 fo r persistent lesions). In the experienced group kappa values did not improve. Discussion: For unexperienced readers, interobserver agreement can be improved by training and consensus formation.

W ithin a time fram e of two weeks gadolinium -enhanced MRI (Magnevist\u00ae: 0.1 mm ol/kg b. w.) was performed in the same patient. Results: Benign liver tum ors showed a significant signal loss in AMI-25enhanced proton density weighted images (FNH (n = 9): 41%,, adenom a (n = 1): 32.4%>) and a strong percentage enhancement in T 1 weighted gradient echo gadolinium -enhanced sequences (FNH: 147.5%,, adenom a: 91.3%,). Ma lignant liver lesions demonstrated no statistically significant signal loss [HCC (n = 8) and metastases (n = 11)] (p < 0.05) using AM I-25-enhanced studies and a percentage enhancement of 116.2%, for HCC and 39.7%, fo r metastases in the gadolinium -enhanced scans. Using receiver operating charcteristics (ROC) statistical analysis revealed a threshold of 10%, fo r percentage sig nal intensity loss of AMI-25-enhanced MRI as the m ost essential criteria to distinguish benign from malignant liver lesions (sensitivity 88%, specificity 89%,). Interobserver analysis of tw o independent observers demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for AMI-25-enhanced MRI (specificity 93%,) versus gadolinium -enhanced MRI (81.5%,) concerning differential diagnosis o f focal liver lesions.

Methods and Materials: 48 cardiac first-pass studies were performed in 9 rabbits under general anesthesia (1.0 T, Siemens Magnetom Impact) using an ultrafast T1-w eighted Turbo-Flash-sequence (TR 4.7 ms, TE 1.6 ms, \u0430 = 90s, 87 images) with a time resolution o f 870 ms. Gadobutrol was iv. bolus injected at tw o concentrations (0.5 M and 1.0 M) and five doses (0.3, 0.15, 0.1, 0.055 and 0.03 mmol Gd/kg body weight). Gadolinium-DTPA-Polylysine (0.5 M) and Gd-DTPA (0.5 M) served as reference agents. Signal changes were calculated from signal intensity measurements o f the left and right ventricle. Results: The higher concentration of 1 M Gadobutrol did not sharpen bolus profiles o f the cavities because o f smaller injection volum es. Best peak profiles with maximum signal intensities during first-pass were observed with a dose of 0.03 mmol Gadobutrol/kg bw and 0.015 mmol Gd-DTPA-Polylysine/kg bw. Conclusion: Using T 1w-T-FLASH first-pass signal changes in cardiac cham bers are best observed following low dose bolus injection of paramagnetic contrast agents irrespective o f the concentration. Blood-pool agents require a further reduction of dose. 14:50 994 A new dedicated contrast agent for MR angiography H J . W einmann, W. Ebert, B. Misselwitz, B. Rad\u00fcchel, H. Schmitt-Willich, J.

Thirty minutes after reperfusion, 20 ml of diluted Gd-MP (5 \u03bc mol/kg) was infused in the coronary artery. In vivo ECG gated T1 weighted turbo FLASH and T2 weighted HASTE MRI, and T1 and T2 weighted MRI of excised heart were performed 4 hours after infusion. Findings of MRI and triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining were planimetrically correlated. Results: C oronary infusion of Gd-MP caused no obvious cardiophysiologic changes. No specific enhancement was found in the heart without Ml. The strongly (200-300% ) enhanced areas on T1 weighted images corresponded precisely to TTC-negative areas (r = 0.97, slope = 1.09) in dogs with AMI. The hyperintense areas on T2 weighted images exceeded infarct size by 130%. Conclusion: Intracoronary Gd-MP-enhanced MRI utilizing the affinity of porphyrin-like agents for necrosis may function as an in vivo histochemi cal assay to identify myocardial viability.15:20 997 Safety, tolerance and diagnostic efficacy of a positive bowel contrast agent for MR im aging of the upper abdomen D.

Endovaginal MRI o f the pelvic floor I.L. Tan, J. Stoker, U.S. Lam\u00e9ris; Rotterdam/NL Introduction: Urinary incontinence is a major problem affecting many women. Its pathology and treatm ent is still under discussion. Demonstrating the anatom ic relation of the pelvic floor structures is essential as a disturbed anatom y is a surgically correctable factor. The spatial resolution o f bodycoil or external surface coil is too limited. Endoanal MRI is a new technique with a detailed demonstration of the pelvic floor. In this study the normal pelvic floor with endovaginal MRI is described. M aterial and Methods: Endovaginal MRI was performed in 10 healthy vol unteers at 1.0 T. The width of the endovaginal coil was 19 mm. Transversal, coronal and sagittal T2W TSE series were performed. Results: The endovaginal coil was well tolerated by all volunteers. The anatom ic relation between urethra, vaginal wall, rectovaginal septum and anal canal was excellently seen. Urethral length ranged from 2.9 to 4.4 cm (median 3.6 cm). Pelvic floor structures were excellently demonstrated. Two structures, not known until now, fixing the urethra and bladderneck to the pelvic floor were demonstrated.Conclusion: Endovaginal MRI is excellent in demonstrating the pelvic floor and m aybe helpful in the diagnostic workup of urethral pathology and urinary incontinence. 14:30 1001 Specific uterine changes in patients undergoing tamoxifen treatm ent: MR imaging S.

M ethods and Materials: Forty patients with previously documented breast carcinoma that underwent tam oxifen treatm ent were investigated with MRI. T1-and T2-w eighted images were obtained. W e also obtained T1-weighted images dynam ically during gadolinium injection. The morphologic appear ance of the uterus w as assessed and compared with hysterosonographic, hysteroscopic and pathologic findings. Results: In 35 patients, at least one polypoid structure was detected in the uterine cavity. The size o f these polyps ranged from 0.4 and 4 cm. Typically, these polyps contained multiple small cysts peripherally and a highly vascularized central part. At pathologic examination, all these polyps proved to be benign. In three other patients, a solid mass, corresponding to endometrial carcinom a (n = 2 ) and metastasis o f breast cancer (n = 1), was found. These malignant tum ors had a different morphologic appearance, both on T2-weighted images and on contrast-enhanced images.

These are com pared in the metastases and adjacent liver parenchym a prior to, and at different tim es after treatm ent in a series of greater than 15 patients. Results: No significant arterial or portal phase enhancem ent is seen in com pletely ablated metastases. Up to fourfold increase in hepatic arterial perfusion is observed immediately surrounding the m etastases post treatment, and also more diffusely in the treated liver segment.

Del Maschio; Milan/I Purpose:Hepatocarcinom a patients previously treated with percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) or with chemoem bolization (TACE) are at high risk of relapse both at the treated lesion and in the remaining liver parenchyma. Aim of this work was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of spiral CT (SCT) and of dynamic Gd enhanced MR imaging (GdMRI) in detecting tum or recurrence. Methods and Materials: 29 hepatocarcinoma patients previously treated with PEI (3/29 patients), TACE (19/29 patients) or PEI and TACE (7/29 patients) have been followed at regular intervals (3 -6 months) both with SC T (3 -4 phases; 5 mm Th.; Pitch 2; 150 ml c.m. 4 ml/sec) and with GdMRI (Torso phased-array coil, Fast SPGR [TR 10 0-17 5 msec, TE 4.2 msec, 62.5 Khz Bandwith] 7 .5 -1 0 mm th., breath-hold 1 5 -3 0 sec, plain and 4 -5 post contrast acquisitions). Areas o f enhancem ent were considered suspect fo r recurrence with both modalities. The standard of reference was percutaneous biopsy, angiography or imaging follow up. Results: In 20/29 patients hepatocarcinom a relapse has been demonstrated during the period of the study (1/20 patients near the treated lesions; 10/20 patients new HCC lesions; 9/20 patients both treated site and new lesions) with the detection of a total of 53 lesions. The presence of relapse was correctly detected with SCT in 16/20 patients (sensitivity, 80%) with the detection of 33/53 lesions (sensitivity, 62.2% ). W ith GdMRI relapse was identified in 18/20 patients (sensitivity, 90%) and 49/53 lesions were detected (sensitivity, 92.5%).

Braunschweig, D.-D. Do, I. Baumgartner, M. Furrer, F. Mahler; Bern/CH Purpose: The classical treatm ent for adventitial cystic disease has been up to now surgical. We developed and evaluated percutaneous ultrasound guided aspiration as new alternative therapy. Methods and Materials: Nine consecutive patients (8 males, one female, mean age 48 years) presented with symptomatic adventitial cystic disease of the popliteal artery. The diagnosis was assessed by color Doppler sonography showing stenosis due to eccentric cysts. Seven patients with severe symptoms gave their informed consent to the new therapeutic procedure on out-patient basis under local anesthesia. By using real-tim e sonography a 14 gauge needle was forwarded percutaneously into the cysts fo r aspiration. Results: The treatm ent w as successful in all 7 cases. No com plications were noted. Follow-up including color Doppler sonography up to 32 months showed no relevant recurrent stenosis. Conclusions: Percutaneous ultrasound guided aspiration is an easy, safe and efficaceous method to treat adventitial cystic disease. It should be considered as the treatm ent o f first choice. 15:00 1024 M anagem ent of peripheral AVMs by em bolotherapy using SAP-microsphere S. Hori, K. Osuga, K. Minamitani, S. Kawata, A.

Materials and Methods: SAP-MS w as originally developed in our research group to achieve better embolic effects fo r the em bolotherapy o f AVMs. It passes through a m icrocatheter and increases in size within minutes, when it contacts with the serum. The size o f the microsphere is exactly calibrated in 50 micrometer steps. No toxicity w as found in animal studies. Thirteen patients (6-upper extremities, 7-lower extremities) were treated transarterially using a m icrocatheter which w as inserted into the feeding artery. SAP-MS w as mixed with an ionic contrast material. The size and quantity of SAP-MS infused varied depending on the extent of the AVMs. Results: Satisfactory results w ere achieved in 11 patients with no combined therapies. Clinical symptoms were reduced fo r the period o f between 3 months and 3 years. No control was achieved in tw o cases with extensive high-flow AVMs. Except fo r slight local pain resulting from arterial blockade fo r a day, patients had few adverse reactions. Conclusion: Except fo r extensive high-flow AVMs, arterial em bolization using SAP-MS effectively controlled peripheral AVMs. No com plications were found during o r after the procedure. 15:10 1025 Haem odialysis access-related venous stenoses and occlusions: Treatm ent with PTA and endovascular stents A.

Cooney; Dublin/IRLIt is a well established fact that substantial doses are imparted to patients in Digital Subtraction Angiographic (DSA) studies in order to reduce the effects of quantum noise and thereby maintain a relatively high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and low contrast sensitivity in the resulting image. The ratio of dose per frame of DSA when com pared to other non-subtraction fluorographic techniques is typically of the order of several hundred. This study constructs an analytical model o f dose and the corresponding noise processes which are relevant to fluorography and DSA from a perspective o f SNR in the resulting image, in an attempt to explain such large dose differentials to a first order of approxim ation. The developed model has been successful with regard to this objective, and the main predictions o f the model have been verified experimentally using Iodine test targets and appropriate image analysis protocols. The possibilities of utilising this model fo r the purposes of optimization strategy in at least a technical sense are also fully explored. -D reconstruction of arterial vessels during interventional neuroradiology R. G raum ann, K. W iesent, A. Bani-Hashemi, D. Holdsworth, P. Durlak; Erlangen/D Purpose: Success of treatm ent o f subarachnoid aneurysm s with endovascular techniques, e.g. placem ent of Guglielmi coils, highly depends on correct filling of the neck. The proposed 3-D system based on conventional C-arm equipm ent provides additional information about vascular geometry that is not provided by DSA alone. Methods and Materials: 2-D views are acquired during a fast rotation (at least 3 0 /sec) covering 200-in approxim ately 6 sec after injection of a contrast agent. Several correction procedures have to be applied due to im perfections of the system (XRII distortion, geometric instability of the Carm). For reconstruction a generalized Feldkamp algorithm is used. Results: Both distortion correction and determination of the true geometry w ork with sufficient accuracy. Very promising results from antropomorphic vascular phantom and living animal studies are presented. Conclusions: A conventional \u0421-arm mounted XRII-system can be extended for 3D-visualization during intervention. This will facilitate more complete em bolization of aneurysm s and thereby improve the outcome of endovascular treatment.14:45 1032 The functional perform ance of autom atic and preprogram mable exposure control (APEX) systems in fluoroscopic imaging systems J.

ISBERG (Huddinge/S)1074 A. Clinical indications and resultsR. Gilles; Le Krem lin-Bic\u00eatre/FThese last 10 years, breast MR imaging has been extensively studied. The results o f all these series agreed in the high sensitivity o f breast MRI for detecting invasive breast cancers (sensitivity: 95%). Therefore, the absence of early contrast enhancem ent after injection o f gadolinium can exclude a suspicion of malignancy with a high level o f confidence (false negative, 5%). However, its specificity reported varies between 40 and 97% . The diagnostic value of quantitative analysis of contrast enhanced lesions is a subject of controversies. Therefore early contrast enhancem ent is not synonym ous of malignancy (false positive, 5 -60% ). Breast MRI has proved to be useful in some difficult diagnostic problem s to exclude breast m alignancy especially in palpable breast masses associated with dense breast on mammograms, and local relapses. Some series have emphasized the high accuracy o f breast MRI S 213 to determ ine the extent o f either invasive or in situ breast carcinomas, and the response o f breast neoplasm to chemotherapy. These have to be confirmed in larger series. Breast MR imaging have proved useful in the follow up of women with silicone breast prostheses. The sensivity and specificity for diagnosing intra-capsular ruptures are 76% and 95% respectively. In conclusion, breast MR imaging offers trem endous potential in the diagnosis and localization breast cancers.1075 B. Technical aspects S.H. Heywang-K\u00f6brunner, R. Beck, P. Viehweg; Halle/D Purpose: Different examination technique, different interpretation criteria and different patient selection influence the results o f contrast-enhanced MRI of the breast. Technical factors which may influence detection and diagnosis of small lesions in particular will be discussed. M ethods and Material: Our experiences are based on the examination of alm ost 3000 MR breast exam inations and on phantom studies, which had been perform ed to optimize MR technique fo r an international breast MRI study. Results: A significant im pact on the diagnostic accuracy is demonstrated for the choice of slice thickness, the choice of pulse sequence (signal response versus tissue concentration of Gd-DTPA), the choice of echo time (opposed versus in phase imaging) patient motion and its effective elimination, mode of fat suppression (spectral selective fat saturation versus subtraction). Further effects concern imaging time, timing of injection, way o f evaluation. The chosen evaluation criteria m ust allow a sensible com prom ise of a high sensitivity and acceptable specificity. Conclusion: Knowledge and awareness of potential pitfalls in technique and evaluation are fundam ental fo r reproducible high quality and clinically useful results. Diagnostic approach to pancreatic tum ors (part I) H.-J. Brambs; Ulm/DDuctal adenocarcinom a of the pancreas continues to have a poor prognosis because of late clinical symptoms. C T and MRI are the m ost common techniques fo r evaluating patients with suspected pancreatic tum or and can contribute to the diagnosis and staging of this disease. W ith refined helical CT scanning techniques and fast MRI techniques the evaluation of early and limited disease can be improved. The diagnosis of pancreatic tum or is based on changes in the density, texture, and contour of the pancreas associated with secondary signs such as dilatation o f the pancreatic and bile ducts and changes in the surrounding fat tissue and the peripancreatic vessels. Helical CT can accurately define the extent of vascular involvement and correctly predict the resectability in the vast majority of patients. Because both methods, CT and MRI, depict the bile and pancreatic ducts sufficiently, ERCP is restricted to selected cases. Three-dimensional helical CT arteriography can display vascular anatom y accurately and can replace conventional angiography in assessing hepatic and mesenteric arterial and portal venous anatomy. Endocrine tum ors of the pancreas are rare neoplasm s that cause distinct clinical syndromes. Many radiological techniques are recommended fo r tumor localization, including ultrasound, endoscopic ultrasound, CT, MRI, angiog raphy, and venous sampling. However, the choice of preoperative imaging continues to be controversial and depends on local expertise and availability of imaging techniques. Recent publications give rise to the recommendation of MRI as the technique of choice to detect small endocrine tumors.",

Allmann, M. Uhl, C. Alteh\u00f6fer, \u0412. Biebow, H. Gufler, A. Reichelt, M. Langer; Freiburg/D Purpose: To evaluate pathologic lesions of the shoulder joint, it is usually examined in one or tw o positions. In ou r study we examined shoulder joints in various defined positions and evaluated the application of cine-MRI in instability and impingement. Materials and Methods: Cine-MRI exam inations were performed 45 patients and 20 healthy volunteers. W e used an open 0.2 T and a closed 1.0 T system. Spoiled gradient echo 2D T1-weighted, T1 and T2 weighted images were used with a field of view o f 180 mm. The exam inations were videotaped and evaluated. Results: W ith the tw o devices which were introduced by ou r group a stan dardized low-budget possibility could be used to perform instability and im pingement examinations. Normal variations o f the gleno-humeral joint were simple to identify. Luxations and subluxations o f the humeral head as ruptures of the labrum could be easily reproduced. This was very helpful especially in a signal changed labrum after arthroscopic refixation of the labrum. The distance between the osseous structures during the dynam ic m ovem ent could be visualised objectively. This method may provide an early diagnosis in impingem ent syndrom. Conclusion: Cine-MRT is useful in visualizing the capsular ligament-complex of the gleno-humeral joint in impingement and instability and is an important tool fo r shoulder diagnostics. 11:05 1106 Value o f US in detecting osteochondral lesions of the humeral head R Bagnolesi, A.

The value of MR imaging in the diagnosis and follow-up exam inations of carpal tunnel syndrom should be clarified in the following study. M aterials and Methods: W rists of 20 patients and 20 volunteers were evalu ated with MRI preoperatively in neutral position, then splinted in 45 degrees extension and 45 degrees flexion. Results: Proximal swelling, distal flattening and increased signal intensity of the median nerve, the palm ar bowing of the flexor retinaculum at the level of the ham ate's hook and at the level o f the pisiforme were significant greater in patients with CTS than in normal volunteers (p < 0.05 his p < 0.001). In postoperative follow -up exam inations the distal flattening of the median nerve normalized in 94%. The increased signal of the median nerve on T2-weighted images decreased postoperatively in 2/3 o f the patients.

Methods and Materials: 26 patients w ho underw ent surgery for known or suspected pancreatic cancer were prospectively assessed for vascular inva sion of the major peripancreatic vessels. Helical scans o f the upper abdomen were performed in the arterial and parenchymal phase using bolustracking (Smartprep\u00ae). In addition CT angiographies (\u0421\u0422\u0410) using Multi-Planar-Volume-Rendering (MPVR) were generated. These findings w ere com pared with those of concurrently performed conventional art\u00e9riographie examinations. Surgical confirmation was used as the standard of truth in all patients. Results: Among the 26 patients 9 tum ors were surgically resectable, 17 were non-resectable. Dual-Phase Helical CT com bined with \u0421\u0422\u0410 and conventional angiography had an overall concordance of 77%.

Maurer, G. Jundt, W. Steinbrich, P. Ochsner, J. Mueller-Brand; Basel/CH Purpose: Chronic posttraum atic osteom yelitis (OM) represents a particular challenge fo r nuclear medicine and radiology since clinical and biochemical parameters are frequently unreliable. The aim o f this study was to investigate the value o f combined bone and inflam matory scintigraphy with 99mTc-labeled monoclonal antigranulocyte antibody (MAB) in patients with suspected chronic OM of the appendicular skeleton. Material and Methods: 26 studies (24 patients: 17 f, 7 m) with suspected chronic posttraumatic OM were evaluated with three-phase-BS/99mTc-MAB-IS. The average num ber of form er operations due to recurrent OM was 4 (range 1-15), the intervall from last surgery to the present w as on average 3.5 years. The final diagnosis w as established by m eans of bone culture and histology in 21 studies and clinical follow -up in 5 cases. The studies were reviewed by tw o independent and experienced observers, the interobserver agreem ent was calculated by kappa-statistics. Results: Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of isolated BS was 93%, 17%, and 58%. Combined BS/99mTc-MAB-IS had a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 84%, 67% and 77% . Of 26 studies 12 were true positive (TP), 2 false negative (FN), 8 true negative (TN), 4 false positive (FP). Two patients presented with unexpected ectopic hem atopoietic bone marrow in the appendicular skeleton that caused false positive results. A high degree of interobserver agreem ent was found (\u043a = 0.85). Conclusion: Combined BS/99mTc-MAB-IS represents a very sensitive and reproducable method with an acceptable specificity fo r the investigation of chronic OM. Problems may occur in the differentiation of low-grade OM from aseptic inflammation. Another problem represents ectopic bone marrow that may occur in the appendicular skeleton due to a chronic inflammatory stimulus. A former intramedullary intervention in the fem ur with displacement of hematopoietic marrow may also lead to an ectopic location and cause false positive studies.14:30 1211 Diagnosis of osteom yelitis in angiological patients: Quantative comparison of radiological and scintigraphic methods C.

Cheng; Chengdu/PRC Purpose: To study the normal CT appearances of the venous arcades of the pancreatic head (VAPH) and establish the normal size measurements, and to address related clinical implications. Methods and Materials: 129 consecutive cases without neoplastic or inflam matory disorders o f the upper abdomen, who underwent contrasted abdominal C T scan during 6 m onths period, were randomly included into the study. The courses of VAPH major tributaries including post, and ante, superior pancre aticoduodenal veins (PSPDV, ASPDV), gastrocolic trunk (GCT), right superior colic vein (RSCV) and right gastroepiploic vein (RGEV) were observed and vessel sizes carefully measured. 20 cases o f pancreatic carcinoma and 25 cases of primary hepatocellular carcinoma were used as controls. Results: C T visualization rates o f PSPDV, ASPDV, GCT, RSCV and RGEV were 63.7% , 77.5% , 69.8% , 70.5% and 34.9% respectively, and the mean values of measured vessel diam eters being 2.28, 2.31, 4.85, 3.01 and 3.85 mm in the sam e order. Anatom ic variation of GCT was present in 11 cases. Abnormalities of VAPH were noticed fo r all controls. Conclusion: Most tributaries o f VAPH can be readily visualized on contrastenhanced C T scans o f normal individuals.

Material and Methods: Dose reduction by pulsed flouroscopy versus contin uous flouroscopy was measured using an anthropom orphic phantom of the pelvic region. The use of different flouroscopy m odes o f 3, 7.5 and 15 pulses per second and continuous flouroscopy w as evaluated in 3500 patients during diagnostic interventional angiographic procedures and in 800 patients during multifunctional flouroscopic procedures. Results: Depending on the type of the flouroscopy unit dose reduction was found as follows: in 3 pulses per second (pps) flouroscopy mode reduction is down to about 10%, in 7.5 pps down to 25% and in 15 pps down to 55% of the dose in continuous flourocopy. 3 pulses per second flouroscopy can be used with sufficient information in about 90% of diagnostic examinations. In some diagnostic examinations and in interventional procedures higher frequencies o f pulses are required in addition. C ontinuous flouroscopy was used in less than 1% o f all examinations. Conclusions: Pulsed flouroscopy has to replace continuous flouroscopy in both interventional and diagnostic angiographic procedures as well as in multifunctional flouroscopic examinations w ithout lack of essential information to reduce exposition of patient and staff. 14:35 1317 CT-guided interventional pain-therapy: Experience in 202 procedures R.

Methods and Materials: Using standard colour Doppler imaging (GDI) acquisi tion methods on a modified Diasonics Gateway ultrasound scanner, estimates of PI, Rl, o r S/D were com puted at each pixel from mean frequency-shift val ues over 2 to 3 cardiac cycles. Scanning was done on various intra-abdominal and peripheral vessels in 12 healthy human subjects. Results: HCDI demonstrated higher pulsatility in arteries than corresponding veins, and inter-arterial variations. It consistently depicted transverse intravas cular gradients fo r all indices, reflecting the greater vascular resistance in laminar flow at vessel walls. Spectral Doppler confirmed, for example, a 46% mean elevation of PI, 17% elevation o f Rl, and 42% elevation of S/D near the walls relative to the central core o f the common carotid artery. Conclusion: HCDI appears to be useful in depicting inter-and intra-vessel variations of PI, Rl and S/D, consistent with theory of fluid dynamics.

The steped digital subtraction peripheral angiography has replaced the conventional angiography in peripheral vascular disease. Among noninvasive tests duplex ultrasonography can differentiate stenosis from occlusion, grade stenosis severely and determ ine the extent o f occlusive disease. C ollor Doppler imaging can evaluate peripheral artery anatom y in renal-time and like conventional duplex ultrasonography can give indication of the localization and quatifications of stenosis severely. Angiography does not give information of the vessel wall o r physiological data. Due to these limitations new imaging modalities, that include intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) spiral computed tom ography and magnetic ressonance angiography (MRA) have been developed. IVUS provides two-dimensional cross-section im aging o f specific points in the vessel wall, giving information of the intima, media, adventitia and perivascu lar structures. Real time provides physiologic information o f the vessel wall com pliance and flow dynamics. Advantages o f C.T. angiography over con ventional angiography are diminished patient mobility, cost and physician time requirement.

M archai3; 1 B asel/C H ,2 Utrecht/NL, 3 Leuven/B The basic requirements for C T angiography are the rapid and continuous acquisition of high resolution volum etric data during the first pass of the contrast bolus in the vessels and appropriate postprocessing. The vascular contrast is function of slice thickness, table pitch, the recon struction algorithm, the size and angle of the vessel, the degree o f vascular enhancement and the attenuation o f the surrounding tissues. MR-angiography has become a widespread method throughout the many imaging centres. The hitherto mostly applied technique is Time-of-Flight (TOF) MRA with the benefits o f being fast, well resolved, semi-selective due to spatial presaturation capabilities, and applicable to several anatom ical areas. Phase Contrast (PC) demonstrates good results in slow flow conditions and allows flow measurements. Contrast-enhanced MRA (\u0421\u0415-MRA) relies on a com bination of a peripheral injection of contrast agent with a very fast TOF acquisition technique. Though similar to CT-Angiography \u0421\u0415-MRA benefits from liberty in image orientation, and stronger sensitivity to contrast media. Besides reconstruction of CE-MRA angiograms is more easy in areas adjacent to bone. Because o f the rapid improvements of the techniques their respective role has to be reassessed. Color Doppler Ultrasonography (CDU) in the study of new bone formation G. Caruso, A. lovane, G. La Tona, R. Lagalla, L. Derchi, M. De Maria; Palermo/I Purpose: To evaluate the role of the CDU in the study of bone callus formation in patients with traumatic fractures. Materials and Methods: 20 patients with traum atic fracture of distal tibial diaphysis treated with external fixator frames were submitted to CDU evaluation (with broaband 5 -1 0 MHz linear array transducer) 1 0 -1 6 days after surgery and every 25 days. Conventional follow-up (clinical and radiographic data) were also performed for com parison until consolidation of fracture. Results: 1 0 -1 6 days after surgery no flow was detected on fracture site in all cases, while few color dots were visible within periskeletal soft tissues. On the second control small color dots w ere detected on fracture site in 18/20 patients while 2/20 had no flow. On the third control 18/20 patients had flow signals presenting as small tortuous vessels on fracture site while 2/20 had few color dots. On the fourth control flow persisted in 18/20 patients while no modification were appreciable in 2/20. On the fifth control a well developed bone callus was observed in 18/20 patients while the remaining tw o had none.

Casselman; Brugge/B CT is very useful fo r the demonstration o f tem poral bone fractures. The main plane is transverse or horizontal showing in 90% of the cases a longitudinal extralabyrinthine fracture with an entrance in the pars squam osa or mastoid. The labyrinthine lesions are transverse originating in the occipital bone. The incus is usually damaged in the long process with o r without dislocations. The stapes may be involved with vestibular luxation, fracture of the footplate and/or lesions o f the annular ligament. CT may also be perform ed in the detection of traum atic labyrinthine fistula particularly through the oval and round windows. In case of post-traumatic nerve paralysis, a hematoma in the course o f the nerve can be detected on MR and the damaged nerve segm ent is sometimes seen as a thickened enhancing region. More over only MR can show the proximal and/or distal extend of the nerve oedema, showing the surgeon that the decompression should be wider. MR can also help in the differentiation between an encephalocele and other tissue o r fluid when a tegm en fracture occurs. MR is also the only technique able to dem onstrate intralabyrinthine hemorrhage (on unenhanced T 1 -weighted images) or fibrosis (on gradient echo images) in case of labyrinthine concussion. The inflam matory changes developing during the days following the occurrence of a perilymph fistula can sometimes be recognized as an intralabyrinthine enhancem ent on MR.

Barentsz; Nijmegen/NLThis course describes the MR appearances and the role of MR in primary staging of urinary bladder (UBC) and prostate carcinoma (PC). In superfi cial tumors, clinical staging which includes transurethral biopsy, is the best technique. For invasive tum ors, MR imaging is superior to other existing techniques, such as C T scanning, transvesical ultrasonography and clinical staging. A limitation of both MR imaging and CT-scanning is the inability to rec ognize minimal tum or growth in the muscle layer of the bladder wall, and the inability to differentiate between post transurethral resection edema and tumor. Therefore, in all patients with urinary bladder cancer staging should preferably start with MR imaging followed by clinical staging. Unfortunately, however, because o f the high cost of this strategy, MR imaging has to be reserved for staging deeply invasive and superficial poorly differentiated tumors. In PC despite general acceptance of the TNM staging system, a lot of controversy and uncertainty with respect to staging still exists. This course gives an overview o f different staging modalities and emphasizes the need for incorporation of prognostic factors, such as tum our grade and volume, in the staging system. What is the practical influence of digital image processing in the diag nostic and therapeutical m anagem ent of patients?

The purposes of this course are to assess the current capabilities of the available bone densitometry methods and their recent technical advances to delineate the criteria fo r appropriate use of bone densitom etry and to define the magnitude of the public health impact of osteoporosis.Four m ajor indications fo r the appropriate use of bone densitometry have emerged. I. Loss of bone due to accelerated resorption in women atm enopause is a universally accepted phenom enon. Most women whobegin estrogen replace ment therapy at the time of menopause o r soonthereafter are spared the normal skeletal degradation that wouldotherwise occur at this point. Knowl edge o f the absolute level of bonedensity and the am ount of subsequent bone loss are im portantconsiderations in assessing the risk fo r future fracture and influencethe decision to begin prophylactics against osteoporosis. II. Quantitative evaluation of the skeleton might be performed in individuals, in whom osteoporosis is suspected on the basis o f radiographic findings or in individuals concerned about their current skeletal status and future risk of fracture based on clinical risk factors. The absolute level of bone density is predictive of fracture risk and a gradient of increasing fracture risk is associated with declining levels o f bone density. Thus, bone density provides an important basis fo r therapeutic decisions. III. Many m etabolic diseases including hyperparathyroidism, renal insufficiency, Cushing's syndrome, prem enopausal am enorrhea, -as well as chronic im mobilization and chronic corticosteroid or thyroid therapy may adversely affect the skeleton. In these secondary forms of osteoporosis, bone density mea surem ent carry prognostic as well as therapeutic implications. IV. Another potent application is the serial assessm ent o r m onitoring o f ther apy. Large annual gains of 5% to 15% in bone mass have been observed in patients receiving calcitonin treatm ent or agents such as bisphosphonates or parathyroid hormone. Intervals between measurements should be appro priately spaced and measurement sites appropriately selected such that the changes to be detected match the precision and sensitivity capabilities of the technique. size and location in the breast and tum or cells can be sampled from can cers as small as only 2 mm. The diagnostic combination o f mammography, stereotaxic fine needle biopsy and cytology can avoid surgical diagnostic biop sies of benign lesions, makes radical surgery possible of malignant lesions in one step and follow -up mammogram s of benign lesions can be avoided. Today, ultrasonographic guidance can be used in many cases due to technical improvement. FNA has proven to be a simple and cheap method. The needles are thin, 22 G -25 G. The feeling during passing the needle into the lesion gives som etimes important additional information, specially when a 25 G needle is used. No local anaesthesia is needed and no real com plications have been reported. Sampling preparation is fast and cytologic interpretation can be made immediately, if desired. The cellular material can be used not only for diagnosis but also fo r biological analyses.",

The results of experimental and clinical studies are introduced. For transluminal treatm ent of arterial aneurysms, different open and covered stent designs are used for exclusion of blood flow from the aneurysm . These stent grafts are also used fo r the sealing o f arterial trauma or arteriovenous fistula. knitted nitinol stents with small meshes w ere also suited fo r the exclusion of aneurysms, as well as semi-open tantalum -dacron mesh stents. For the prevention of restenosis due to intim ai hyperplasia, stents covered with different types of synthetic m embranes (dacron, nylon, PTFE) have been developed in order to prevent proliferation of smooth muscle cells through the open stent mesh into the arterial lumen. Their efficacy is impaired by restenosis occurring especially at the stent ends. Local treatm ent of the arterial wall is proposed as a new method fo r the prevention of restenosis. Stents coated with different types of biodegradable polymers releasing heparin or corticosteroid were tested in an experimental study, preliminary results being promising.This presentation deals with some normal variants that may simulate chest disease. W e will present different cases with a through discussion o f the findings, and clues to recognize these entities. The talk will be divided in tw o categories of findings: 1.-Tubular and linear opacities. 2.-Nodular and extrapulm onary opacities.In the first category we describe different conditions such as intrapulm onary systemic veins, pseudo-intrapulmonary sistem ic arterys, pulm onary venous anomalies, and lineal images produced by accessory fissures or duplication of the diaphragm. The second group is composed of a variety of conditions that can produce nodular images or opacities. Chest wall lesions such as osteophytes and skin lesions are causes of pulm onary pseudonodule. Less known is the pseudonodule due to tortuosity of branches o f the aortic arch. A nodule caused by a pulm onary vein can be observed occasionally in the posterior wall o f the bronchus intermedius. Fat is com m only present in the chest and can also give rise to different images that simulate pulm onary or pleural pathology. An opaque azygos lobe in the frontal chest radiograph can be due to elongation of aortic branches. Dense breasts in young women may confuse with pulm onary consolidation, and patients with mastectom y can show a peculiar density in the lateral chest radiograph.Recently clinical studies (ECASS; NIH-rt-PA Stroke Study Group) have, demonstrated the efficacy of systemic (i.v.) fibrinolytic treatm ent in stroke patients.

Results: MRCP studies with oral contrast application predom inantly showed better delineation o f ductal structures com pared with MRCP without oral contrast. This is due to suppression o f the signal of liquid in the duodenum. The improved visualization depends in part on the anatom ic location especially in the peripapillary region. The rare cases without benefit of oral contrast application are to be discussed. Conclusion: MRCP examination with oral superparam agnetic particles im proves the depiction of the biliary and pancreatic duct system and seems to be the concept of first choice. Holzknecht, T.

In the patient group, there was a high correlation between MRCP techniques and ERCP (R = 87%). Discrepancies were caused by peristalsis and susceptibility artifacts due to biliary stents and post op clips. Conclusion: The combination of \" ERCP-like\" RARE and tom ographic detail HASTE imaging makes both techniques together the ideal tool for the noninvasive assessment of the biliary system.

Turbulent and laminary flow characteristics and pressure gradients were sem iquantitatively determ ined in either expanded stent, 25% and 50% stenosis. The flow was visualized with the help of anionic particles shooted with tw o Helium-Neon lasers.Results: Visualization o f flow was achieved in all stents or stent grafts. No significant pressure gradients were measured (p < 0.0001). In case of physiological flow of 1.5 l/min and complete expansion the Angiomed\u2122 stent (79.3% ) permitted maximum of laminary flow, the Wall\u2122 stent (66.2%) least (p < 0.0001). In 25% stenosis the Wall\u2122 stent (57.5%) allowed maximum and the Cragg Endopro\u2122 stent (19.8%) least laminary flow (p < 0.0001). Any of the stent ensured laminary flow, when contracted to 50% stenosis.

M aterials and Methods: Breath holding multislice dynamic EBCT of chest in initial 35 seconds after bolus injection of 50 mL contrast medium were per formed in 16 patients with primary pulm onary neoplasm. The tum or blood flow was calculated from dividing the peak gradient of the tum or time-attenuation curve by the peak arterial enhancement. The tum or blood flow was correlated with maximum enhancem ent of the tumors, histopathologic cell type, cellular differentiation and microvascular count.Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic potential of breathhold MRI in the detection of pulm onary metastases and to compare its sensitivity with that of spiral CT. mm in 48, > 10 mm in 29 nodules.Calcifications were seen in 7 nodules. Spiculae were seen in 8 lesions.Conclusion: Low-dose spiral C T of the chest may be useful in detecting pulm onary nodules. An increase in image noise occurs with low dose scanning and attention m ust be paid with respect to small lesions in order neither to over-nor to underread low-dose examinations.Purpose: To evaluate clinical applications of subsecond MR-imaging of tho racic lesions, the benefit of contrast enhancement and to compare the findings with surgical and histological staging.Methods and Materials:The studies were performed on 1.5 T MR-systems (Magnetom SP 4000 and Magnetom Vision, Siemens) using the whole-body resonator. Three sequences T1 w-TurboFLASH, FLASH and T2w-TurboFLASH (TF) were used and images acquired in the transversal, coronal, sagittal plane. A dynam ic series was acquired using a fast FLASH sequence in the transversal plane. 25 patients were preoperatively studied. Results: Best lesion detection is achieved by com bining the FLASH and T2w-TF sequence. Analysis of the dynamic contrast enhancem ent by quantitative techniques, especially by pharmacokinetic analysis improves the lesion clas sification. Despite subsecond imaging, breathholding improves image quality and can be integrated in the protocol. Total examination time w as less than 30 min. in all patients. The currently still limited data indicate, that Fast-MRI can improve T-staging, while N-staging remains com parable to CT.

Methods and Materials: In a prospective study starting in 8/96 seven patients (3 male, 4 fem ale) underwent helical C T (Somatom plus 4, Siemens) after drinking Mucofalk-water suspension (about 1500 ml). Protocol: 5 mm collimation, pitch 1.5, i.v. contrast material 100 ml, flow 3 ml/s, scandelay 25 sec. The spiral C T and conventional radiology findings were compared retrospectively. Our study group consisted of 5 patients with Crohn's disease and 2 patients suffered from ulcerative colitis. Results: All patients had a well distended bowel with good opacification which is necessary to provide diagnostic error. CT demonstrated wall thickening (> 4 mm) in all patients (100%).

Methods and Materials: In this prospective study ileoendoscopy and MCESCT are performed in patients suffering from CD prior to surgery. To date, 20 pa tients underwent MCESCT and ileoendoscopy within 4 weeks. Instillation of 2000 ml methyl cellulose through a jejunal tube provides adequate disten sion of the small bowel loops.

Iv. administration of 120 ml nonionic contrast material (flow rate o f 4 ml/sec, scan delay = 25 sec). Both methods are com pared with respect to the detection, the localization, and to possible com plications o f CD. Results: 11 patients (55%) had a stenosis (colon: 3, ileocecal/ileal: 8) which could not be passed by ileoendoscopy. MCESCT demonstrated all ileocecal and ileal stenosis, all colon stenosis were missed because o f inadequate distension.

D u rw e n 1, G. M ackow iak1, E. M \u00fc lle r2, W. G e h le n 1, L. H euser1 ; 1 Bochum/D, 2 Erlangen/D Purpose: Unilateral repetitive hand movements activate usually the contralat eral m otor cortex, w hich can be shown by fM R I. For further evaluation o f this phenomenon, fMRI as well as EMG recording w as carried out subsequently. Methods and Materials: In both paradigm s 34 subjects (19 right/11 left/4 am bidextrous handers; 18 females, 16 men, mean age 30.6 years) had to carry out repetitive hand movements (spreading) with the dom inant right/left as well as with the subdominant left/right side. The fMRI was performed by use of TR 1.68 ms, TE 64 ms, FOV 220 mm matrix 114 x 128, 14 slices, 2 slabs). The EMG recordings were carried out with a polygraph (Picker). Results: Bilateral cortical activation was found in fMRI in 6 right-handed subjects (31.6% ) moving the dom inant hand vs. 12 subjects (63.2%) moving the subdom inant hand and in the dom inant left-hand group in 6 (54.5%) using the dom inant left vs. 8 (72.2% ) moving the subdominant right hand and 2 (50%) (right hand) vs. 3 (75% ) (left hand) in the am bidextrous group. The EMG recording m irror activity was found in 7 subjects (36.8%) using the right dom inant vs. 15 (78.9%) using the left subdominant hand; in the left handed group 7 (63.7% ) mirror activities were detected for the left and 9 (81.8%) for the right hand side as well as 2 (50%) for the right vs. 3 (75%) fo r the left activated hand in the am bidextrous group. Conclusions: In right-handers bilateral cortical activation in fMRI is particularly associated with unilateral hand movements of the subdominant left side, only minor differences were found in the left-handed group. Further evaluation has to be done in the am bidextrous group due to the small numbers. These findings are in agreem ent with the conditions of manifestation o f EMG mirror activity shown in previous studies.",

Grodd; T\u00fcbingen/D Purpose: C ortical DC potentials demonstrated a slow negative voltage shift (Bereitschaftspotential) within the supplementary motor area (SMA), which precedes the potential o f the prim ary m otor cortex (PMC). Echo-planarimaging (EPI) w as applied to detect sequential hemodynamic activation of SMA and PMC during voluntary finger movement. Methods and Materials: Data were acquired with a 1.5 T scanner using a single-slice EPI sequence (\u0422\u0415 43 ms, TR 107 ms). Six subjects performed 4 periods of right index finger movements during subsequent measurements of a single slice a t the level of the SMA and PMC. The time delay between the m otor response and the fMRI signal increase within SMA and PMC was determ ined by calculating the time position of the maximal cross-correlation coefficient of the respective signal time courses and a rectangular function indicating the m ovem ent periods. Results: Onset o f activation am ounted to 1.62 s ( \u00b1 0.66) in SMA and 2.97 s ( \u00b1 1.47) in PMC. The time shift (A t = 1.35 s \u00b1 1.14) between both regions was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Sufficient tem poral resolution (107 ms) to detect sequential activation o f functionally connected cortical areas can be achived by fMRI. The mean tim e shift of 1.35 s between SMA and PMC is in good agreem ent with the electrophysiological data, supporting the hypothesis that vascular behaviour parallels the sequence of electrical events in the cortex.614 FLASH and EPI techniques for functional MRI of the motor cortexC.

Methods and Materials: fMRI was perform ed on a 1.5 T scanner (SP4000, Siemens) with 10 mT/m gradients (rise time: 1 ms). FLASH (matrix size: 1282, 642) and single shot EPI (matrix size: 642) sequences were com pared in 35 healthy volunteers applying a sim ple m otor task (clenching and spreading of the right or left hand). Quality of subtraction images (activation -rest), t-maps, and time course o f signal intensity in activated regions were evaluated visually on a scale between 1 and 5, mean signal increase and area o f activated regions in the m otor cortex were assessed quantitatively. Statistical analysis included W ilcoxon's test (p < 0.05). Results: FLASH and EPI revealed sim ilar results for the quality of time course in activated regions. FLASH 1282 was significantly superior to EPI 642 regarding subtraction image and mean signal increase; EPI 642, however, showed significantly better quality of t-m aps and significantly larger areas of activation. Taking into account the results fo r FLASH 642 the differences could be attributed to different matrix sizes. Conclusion: FLASH and EPI proved to be equivalent techniques fo r fMRI of the m otor cortex.615 Analysis of cortical hand and foot m otor areas investigated with functional MR im aging (fMRI) G. Leinsinger, D. Heiss, R. Toms, A. Jassoy, T. Pfl\u00fcger, K.

Subjects and Methods: Functional MRI was performed in 10 healthy volun teers, including 2 ballet dancers, during hand and foot movements. Another 20 subjects (14 right-handed, 6 left-handed) were investigated with movements of dom inant and non-dominant hand. Four musicians were exam ined with simple and com plex paradigms. Functional MR was perform ed with a 2D-FLASH sequence (\u0422 \u0420 \u042f \u0415 = 46.75/30 ms, FA = 40u, TH = 4 mm). For quantitative evaluation we used volum es o f interest in normalized cross-correlation maps. Results: With hand movement, a specific area was found at the superior bend of the contralateral central sulcus. The spatial extension o f this area was 143 \u00b1 87 voxel for movement of dom inant and 116 \u00b1 63 voxel of nondom inant hand.",

Szczerbo-Trojanowska; Lublin/PL Purpose: To assess usefulness of Power Doppler Imaging (PDI) in evaluation o f vertebral artery (VA) mechanical com pression in patients with vertebrobasi lar insuficiency (VBI) symptoms, frequently related to specific head turning. Methods and Materials: All Doppler US procedures were carried out with Logiq 500 (GEMS), equipped with 192-element, 5 -1 0 MHz linear transducer, using Duplex, C olor and Power imaging. PDI technique was employed as VA m apping for precise PW -Doppler range gate placing -for spectral waveform analysis. Power assisted Doppler US of VAs was performed in 306 patients with VBI -(200 F, 106 M, mean age 65). The clinical symptoms were: non specific vertigo (47), poor coordination (30), drop attacs (26) and combination of them (203). 198 (65%) patients regarded their VBI symptoms to specific head position. Thus, all Doppler examinations were performed in a dynamic w ay -in 4 head positions: hyperextension, flexion, right/left rotation and in specific positioning reported by a patient. Cervical spondylosis w as evident on X-ray films in 217 (71% ) patients. Results: Normal VAs were shown in 118 patients. Diagnoses of VA mechanical com pression were based on finding of blood flow acceleration in compressed section and flow decrease above or absence o f flow after a specific head turning. VA com pression was found in 54 (18%) patients: 18 unilateral (28 right, 20 left) and 6 bilateral. In 51 cases com pressions were revealed in intertransverse VA portion, at C4 -C6 levels, w hat corresponded to cervical spondylosis (especially uncovertebral joint osteophytes), documented on X-ray films. In 3 cases com pression sites were not identified. Using PDI technique enabled proper visualization o f real course o f VAs in 81 (26%) patients, in whom Duplex and C olor images were not satisfactory fo r accurate PW-Doppler analysis. Remaining pathologic findings were as followed: hypoplastic arteries 47, intertransverse portion kinking 40, proximal stenosis 29 and subclavian steal syndrome 18. Conclusion: Mechanical compression o f extracranial VAs related to head turning is a frequent pathology, especially in older population, commonly suffered from cervical spondylosis. Noninvasive Doppler procedures are of great importance in diagnosing such pathology. PDI technique facilitate the diagnosis by showing real course of VA, particularly its intertransverse portion -lying deeply in the bony canal -w hat is crucial for accurate PW-Doppler spectral analysis and velocity measurements.1124 Coronary screening with breath-hold 3D MR coronary angiography P.A. W ielopolski, P. de Feyter, H.G. de Bruin, A.H.H. Bongaerts, M. Oudkerk; Rotterdam/NL Purpose:To dem onstrate a fast protocol for coronary magnetic resonance angiography (CMRA). Methods and Materials: Two 3D breathhold sequences were selected for rapid CM RA evaluation on 20 subjects. Volume localization was performed with a 3D segm ented EPI sequence (SEPI), covering the heart in a single o r several breathholds (depending on coverage/heart size). The number of partitions/EPI ms, FOV = 150 x 320 mm, 256 matrix) to keep the breathholding time constant (~ 20 seconds, resolution independent from cardiac rate). Additionally, a double-oblique, segmented 3D turboFLASH sequence targeted each coronary artery (4 -6 sections, 2 -4 mm thick). MPRs were used to follow the coronaries while 3D rendering permitted visualization in any desired view. Studies were performed on a 1.5 T Magnetom Vision scanner.Results: Consistent 3D CMRAs were obtained and coronaries could be followed from base to apex. With poor fat suppression, SEPI presented some ghosting artifacts (reduced after applying a saturation band). It is feared that the opposed fat-w ater echo used in both SEPI and turboFLASH could produce intravoxel cancellation and show artifactual vessel thinning and signal loss. Conclusion: An approach for fast 3D CM RA is presented using pulse se quences tailored to use the full capabilities of our EPI MRI system.1125 Results of endovascular treatm ent of the carotid and supraaortic vessels K. H\u00fcttl, L. Szl\u00e1vy; Budapest/H Purpose: To evaluate percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) as an alternative to surgery fo r varying degree of lesions on the supraaortic extracranial arterial branches. Material and Methods: Between January 1, 1979 and Decem ber 31, 1995 we reviewed PTA performed on the supraaortic extracranial arterial branches. During this period we performed totally 2831 PTA procedures on the varying arterial vessels of the human body. 541 out of the 2831 PTA-s w as performed on the supraaortic extracranial arterial branches. (19.1%) N um ber o f brachiocephalic angioplasties (from January 1, 1979 until Decem ber 31, 1995). All of the patients was symptomatic who underw ent PTA of the supraaortic extracranial arterial branches. In the last five years -in selected cases -we used intravascular US and angioscopy fo r evaluation of symptoms causing arterial lesions. Results: The immediate mortality after PT/> has been 0% in our patients during the period o f 16 years observation's time. During the PTA procedure one patient had a m ajor stroke, while another had a short time observable TIA. At 12 out of 14 cases a minor com plications have occurred. Our average follow up time was 29 months. The life-table analysis (follow-up time from 0 until 10 years) shown 0.91 patency rate in patients w here PTA was performed on the supraaortic extracranial arterial branches. The administration of IVUS and angioscopy during PTA -nowadays we are on the learning curve -our purpose is -to prevent the com plication during PTA. Conclusion: (-1 -) The application of PTA for treatm ent of symptomatic patients with lesions on the supraaortic extracranial arterial branches -except the lesions on the internal carotid arteries -may be assessed as a reasonable alternative fo r vascular surgery. (-2-) Although the role o f carotid artery PTA is at yet undefined, our experience suggests that PTA is a feasible, less invasive to carotid surgery. Long term controlled studies are needed to define the indication o f PTA fo r carotid stenosis. 1126 CT angiography (\u0421\u0422\u0410) in carotid bifurcation stenoses; Com parison with MR angiography (M RA) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) L. B e lli1, C. Fugazzola1, G. V io la 1, F. B a ru zzi1, P. C a ste lli1, F. Interdonato1, A. M artegani2, G.M. B elloni2; 1 Varese/I, 2 Como/I Purpose:To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of \u0421\u0422\u0410 and MRA for the visual ization of carotid bifurcation stenoses, in order to avoid invasive angiography w henever surgery is considered. Methods and Materials: 17 patients (34 carotid bifurcations) were studied with \u0421\u0422\u0410, MRA and DSA. DSA was considered the gold standard to determine the degree of stenosis; surgical specim ens were available in 15 cases for the morphological characterization of the plaques. Results: DSA showed 30 stenoses, of which 29 were correctly identified by \u0421\u0422\u0410 and MRA; as regards the stenosis degree, \u0421\u0422\u0410 agreed with DSA in 28/30 cases while MRA agreed in 23/30 cases; in particular \u0421\u0422\u0410 was always correct fo r 12 stenoses > 70% , while MRA underestim ated tw o cases. At surgery 15 plaques were ulcerated: ulcerations w ere properly recognized by \u0421\u0422\u0410 in 85%, by DSA in 46% and by MRA in 23% of the cases. Soft o r calcified plaques were correctly characterized by \u0421\u0422\u0410 in 94% of the cases. Conclusions: \u0421\u0422\u0410 is more accurate then MRA in evaluation of the carotid bifurcation and can replace DSA before surgery.1127 Can color-flow Doppler (C FD) replace angiography in preoperative carotid work-up? H.-P. Dinkel, M. Fieger, J. Kn\u00fcpffer, R. Moll; W \u00fcrzburg/DPurpose: W e investigated the accuracy of CFD of the carotids in the assess ment of significant stenoses (> 50% according to the NASCET criteria); clinical impact of 88 carotid angiographies on patient management was analyzed. Methods: In a retrospective study we reviewed all 601 colorflow Doppler exams achieved in a period of one year in 455 patients correlating them to clinical, angiographic and intraoperative data. Results: 108 examinations were checked by angiography and/or operation. All 80 cases of significant stenosis were demonstrated correctly by CFD. In 315 patients a ICA stenosis was excluded by CFD; all of these diagnoses were confirmed by clinical course. 35 of 601 examinations were regarded as incompletely interpretable. Of 88 angiographies 79 had no therapeutic conse quences, 7 cases consisted only in working up not com pletely interpretable CFDs. Only in 2 of 88 cases relevant extra information unsuspected by CFD (ulceration) was revealed by angiography. Conclusions: In many cases cerebral angiography is not needed in pre operative assessment of suspected carotid stenosis. A diagnostic algorithm is shown. Ambiguous o r incomplete CFD results -less frequent than 4% -should be worked up by angiography. If CFD is unequivocal diagnosis of stenosis needs no angiographic confirmation. Symptomatic CVI patients should be screened for ulcers by both methods if they lack stenosis.1128 MR Angiography and MR phase contrast flow quantification in the evaluation of carotid artery stenosis C. Catalano, P. Pavone, A. Scipioni, A. Laghi, R. Kayal, F.R. Grasso, R. Passariello; Rome/I Introduction: MR Angiography it is a safe and non invasive technique for screening patient w hit carotid artery stenosis. MR flow quantification whit the phase contrast method allows to obtain volum etric and velocim etric curves. Purpose: of our study was to evaluate, the usefulness of com binig MRA with MR flow measurements. Materials and Methods: 34 patients were included in the study. All exams were performed using a 0.5 T magnet, with high gradient power. The technique used was a 2D TOF. The sequence used fo r flow quantification w as a CinePhase Contrast. In all cases measurements were performed at the level of both common carotid, internal carotid and vertebral arteries. VFR and PSV were calculated by placing, respectively, a ROI cincum ferential to the vessel and a 1 pixel ROI in the centre of the vessel. Results: The evaluation of MRA images alone provided a sensitivity and specificy of respectively 64 and 81%. The adjunct o f MR flow measurement to MRA allowed to reach a sensitivity and specificity respectively of 93% and 95%. Conclusion: C arotid endoarterectom y can be performed on the basis of MRA alone. Significant improvem ents in diagnostic accuracy can be obtained com bining MRA with MR flow measurements. In particular MR flow measurements may be helpful in the determ ination o f the hemodynamics of a stenosis.1129 Function, perfusion and m orphology in m yocardial infarction: Clinical results of MR-imaging S.

Patients and Methods: 33 consecutive patients with high signal intensity lesions on T2-weighted im ages (n = 28) o r intracerebral hemorrhage (n = 5) were examined on a 1.5 T MR system. Thin section GRASE and TSE sequences were performed with equal scan times. Images were evaluated side-by-side by tw o independent radiologists. Lesion conspicuity, image quality and artefacts were scored on a subjective basis. Lesion-to-brain contrast and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) were measured by regions of interest (ROI). Results: Supratentorial lesions were shown both by GRASE and TSE with the same conspicuity. The detectability o f the generally smaller infratentorial lesions w as significantly inferior on grase. Physiologic ferritin as well as pathologic hemosiderin depositions were slightly darker and thereby better visible on GRASE. Gray-white matter differentiation w as better on TSE. GRASE also showed significantly more artefacts. Conclusion: TSE images have certain advantages over GRASE in routine clinical MR brain imaging.1144 MRI of the brain in children using fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLA IR ) pulse sequence M.

Methods and Materials: MR images were obtained in 15 patients with a history of perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. The ages of patients ranged from 1 m onth to 3 years. W ith a 1.5 T superconducting unit, the FLAIR images w ere obtained a t a repetition time (TR) of 6000-65 00 ms, a echo tim e(TE) of 88 ms, and an inversion time (Tl) of 15 00-1800 ms. FLAIR images w ere evaluated qualitatively in com parison with T1 and T2-weighted spin echo images by three experienced neuroradiologists. Quantitative analysis was also performed. Result: FLAIR images were superior to T1 and T2-weighted images in detection of periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), cystic PVL and subcortical lesions near the brain surface. On T1-o r T2-w eighted images, almost all lesions were demonstrated as hypo-or hyperintensity areas, respectively. However, FLAIR images could differentiate cystic lesions by their signal intensities. FLAIR images were not diagnostic in 10 and 11-m onth-old infants.

Bakke, E.A. Jacobsen, J.K. Hald; Oslo/N Purpose: Magnetic resonance im aging (MRI) may detect MTS by means of 3D-volumetric T1WI and/or T2W I. Autopsy studies have demonstrated bilateral atrophy in 50% o f cases with MTS.Focal change in signal intensity may be more reliable. In the present study we com pared FLAIR with T2WI and 3D-volumetric measurement. Methods and Materials: Thirty-five patients underwent both coronal FLAIR and T2 weighted MR imaging. 3D-volum etric studies were performed in 15 patients. The epileptic focus was determ ined by consensus of three neuroradiologists evaluating volum e o f the tem poral horns, the temporal lobes, the hippocam pii/amygdalae and changes in signal intensity of hippocampii/amygdalae. Findings were com pared to the EEG results. Results: T2WI (35 pats.) detected focus in 69%, and were false positive with respect to EEG findings in 23%. FLAIR (35 pats.) detected focus in 69% and was false positive in 11 %. Volumetric studies (15 pats.) predicted focus in 87% and were false positive in 7%. Conclusion: The diagnosis MTS depends upon both atrophy and increased signal intensity. In this study 3D-volumetric imaging was a better method to demonstrate volume reduction. T2W I or FLAIR were necessary to evaluate changes in signal intensity, however a higher degree of false positive results was found by T2WI.1149 Role of turbo-FLAIR in the assessm ent of intraaxial brain tumors M.

Results: In the form er group with prior TUR, widening of the prostatic urethra and periurethral low signal halo were observed in all of the 11 cases. The corresponding histopathologic findings were granulom atous reaction perme ated with inflammatory cells which included foreign body giant cells. On the other hand, the similar findings were not depicted in the latter group, either radiographically o r pathologically. Conclusion: Inflammatory tissue reaction is the m ajor pathologic change of periurethral low signal halo in MR images of the prostate after TUR-P.1159 Color-Doppler ultrasound of the prostate: A ssessm ent of the resistive index (Rl) G. Helweg, F. Frauscher, M. Kreiter, G. , T. Frede, P. S\u00f6gner, H. Strasser, A. Reissigl, D. zur Nedden, G. Bartsch; Innsbruck/A Purpose:To evaluate the role of color-Doppler ultrasound (CDU) using the resistive-index (R l) in the normal prostate, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer. Methods and Materials: 88 patients (22 with normal prostate, 41 with BPH and 25 with prostate cancer) with a mean age of 55 ( \u00b1 18.4) were examined by CDU. W e measured the Rl in peripheral, central and transitional zones. The diagnosis of BPH and prostate cancer was histologically proven. Results: In the peripheral and transitional zones the Rl did not vary signifi cantly between any of the groups (measuring 0.83 \u00b1 0.05 in the periphery and 0.64 \u00b1 0.06 in the transitional zone). In the central zone the Rl was signifi cantly elevated in only the BPH patients, measuring 0.77 \u00b1 0.05 com pared to 0.65 \u00b1 0.07 in the other groups. Conclusion: Resistive index measurements cannot be used to exclude prostate cancer. An elevated Rl (over 0.75) in the central zone, however, is indicative of BPH.1160 Diagnostic value of MR im aging in patients with suspicion of neoplasm of the testis W. Kersjes, I. M\u00fcller, P. Grebe, K. Schunk, H. Cagil, J. Fichtner, M. Thelen; Mainz/D Purpose: To investigate the diagnostic value of MRI in patients with suspicion of neoplasm of the testis in com parison to ultrasonography. 2. Methods and Materials: 113 patients were examined by ultrasonography.In all patients MR examinations were performed in a mean time interval of 12 days to ultrasound to confirm the suspicion of neoplasm of the testis or to exclude a malignant lesion definitely. MR imaging at 0.5 T included conventional T1-weighted sequences before and after injection of Gd-DTPA (0.2 mmol/kg body weight) and T2-weighted SE sequences. The results of ultrasonography and MRI were com pared to surgical findings or to further clinical follow-up. 3. Results: W hereas ultrasonography revealed a sensitivity of 54% and a speci ficity of 82% MRI reached a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 92% in the diagnosis of a malignant lesion of the testis. 4. Conclusion: MRI is the most valuable imaging method in the diagnosis of tumors o f the testis. In all cases w here ultrasonography is not unequivocal in the diagnosis of a lesion o f the testis MRI should be performed.1161 Tubular ectasia of rete testis: Ultrasonographic study R. Ramini, L.

Lencioni, A. Paolicchi, N. Armillotta, M. Di Giulio, M. Moretti, M. Tonerini, A.M. Bassi, \u0421. Bartolozzi; Pisa/lPurpose: To evaluate local therapeutic effect and long-term survival rates after combined transcatheter arterial chem oem bolization (TACE) and percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) fo r single, large, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods and Materials: Eighty-six cirrhotic patients with single, large (3 -8 cm) HCC underwent combined TACE and PEI over a 6-year period. All patients were in Child-Pugh class A o r B. Patients were followed after therapy by m eans of clinical examinations, laboratory tests, and US and CT studies performed at regular time intervals. Survival rates were determ ined according to the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: No major com plication was observed. A com plete therapeutic re sponse was obtained in 71 (82%) of 86 patients. The overall survival rates w ere 92% at 1 year, 83% at 2 years, 69% at 3 years, 58% a t 4-years, and 47% at 5 years. Survival of Child-Pugh A patients w as significantly longer (p < 0.01) than that of Child-Pugh \u0412 patients. The survival rates of patients with HCC o f 3 -5 cm were higher than those o f patients with HCC of 5 -8 cm, although the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05) Conclusion: Combined TACE and PEI is a highly effective treatm ent for single, large HCC. In term s o f survival, the long-term results of combined TACE and PEI therapy are superior to those obtained in matched patients treated with TACE alone, and seem to be comparable to the published results of surgical resection.1163 Metallic stents as palliative treatm ent of m alignant gastroduodenal stenosis T. de Ba\u00e8re, G.

El Kashif, C. Lagrange, G. Saade, T. de Ba\u00e8re, A. Roche; Villejuif/F Purpose: Results of chem oem bolization in progressive hepatic metastasis of neuroendocrine origin are reported in a series o f 50 patients. Material and Methods: Half of the patients had a prim ary carcinoid tumor, o f whom 19 presented symptoms related to tum or secretion. The primary tum or w as pancreatic in origin in 22 over the last 25 patients.Overall mean o f 2.28 chem oem bolisation sessions/patient were performed, with a mean inter-session period of 15 weeks. Mean follow up duration was 17 months for clinical, morphological and biological evaluation Results: Sym ptom atic response w as com plete in 73% and partial in 27% and correlated with biological response. Compared mean survival after the first session of chem oem bolization in patients with carcinoid tum or and in those with other neuroendocrine prim aries was respectively 26 and 17 months. Twenty three patients are alive at the end of the study. Four patients, among whom three had biliary-enteric anastom ose resulting from primary tum or resection, developed liver abcesses after treatment. Conclusion: Chem oem bolization dramatically improves symptoms related to tum or secretion and may be recommended soon in the course of the disease. N evertheless, bilioenteric anastom oses should be considered as a m ajor factor risk for com plication of chemoembolization.1165 Usefulness of percutaneous ethanol injection during enhanced US with C 0 2 m icrobubbles for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma K. Ohno, K. Terayama, T. Yamashita, H. Morisita, A. Takada, T. Maeda; Kyoto/J Purpose: To assess the efficacy o f percutaneous ethanol injection during enhanced US with C 0 2 m icrobubbles fo r hepatocellular carcinoma M aterials and Methods: 21 patients with recurent or residual hepatocellular carcinom a underwent percutaneous ethanol injection during enhanced US with C 0 2 m icrobubbles for hepatocellular carcinoma. The procedure was as follows. After infusion of C 0 2 m icrobubbles at the proper hepatic level, enhanced hepatocellular carcinoma was detected ultrasonographically. And percutaneous ethanol injection was done according to that guidance. Results: In all of the cases, percutaneous ethanol injection during enhanced US with C 0 2 m icrobubbles was performed safely and precisely for the recur rent hepatocellular carcinoma. Conclusion: Percutaneous ethanol injection during enhanced US with C 0 2 m icrobubbles is useful fo r recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma.1166 Longterm results of percutaneous treatm ent of m alignant obstructive jaundice with m etallic stents: Hilar vs. common duct obstruction C.D. Becker, P.A. Schneider, G. Mentha, F. Terrier; Geneva/CH Objective: To com pare the longterm palliative results of percutaneously in serted metallic endoprostheses in patients with hilar and with non-hilar bile duct obstruction. Materials and Methods: 122 patients with obstructive jaundice due to proven unresectable m alignant neoplasms o f the bile ducts, gallbladder, o r pancreas o r due to metastatic disease were treated percutaneously with single or multiple W allstents. Obstruction was a t the hilar level in 67 patients (group 1) and a t the com m on duct level in 55 patients (group 2). Palliative results obtained in both groups were compared. Results: The 30-day mortality was 12%, and was similar in both groups. The overall mean (median) survival was 8.7 (5.5) months in group 1 and 7.7 (4.5) months in group 2 (p = 0.86). The stent occlusion rate was 41% in group 1 and 8.3% in group 2. Overall reintervention rate fo r longterm com plications was 33% in group 1 and 9% in group 2. The stent patency w as significantly better for group 2 than fo r group 1 (p = 0.015). Reinterventions were successful in 91% of cases.Conclusion: Palliative results were significantly better in patients with common duct obstruction than in patients with hilar obstruction. Overall survival was similar. Com bined radiological/endoscopic approach for the reconstitution o f interrupted biliary tract: Experience in 5 cases P. Ricci, M. Rossi, F.M. Salvatori, M. Bezzi, P. Pavone, G. Bonomo, P. Rossi; Rome/I Purpose: To assess the usefulness of the com bined radiological/endoscopic approach in the re-establishment of interrupted biliary tract Materials and Methods: five patients with com plete transection or ligation of the biliary tract and bile leakage underwent radiological evaluation for possible interventional treatment. Biliary damage was secondary to trauma in one case and to com plications of laparoscopic o r open surgery in four.In all cases a transhepatic percutaneous approach was used in combination with an endoscopic biliary intervention, mostly by means of the \" rendez-vous technique\". Results: the interrupted tract was crossed in all cases and a catheter for internal-external drainage w as placed, in order to eliminate jaundice and bile leakage. All the stenoses were then dilated. Two patients still have a catheter in place at 8 and 13 m onths of follow up. In tw o patient the catheter was removed after 5 and 6 months o f drainage, and they are asymptomatic at 32 and 20 months of follow up respectively. Finally in one patient the catheter was replaced by plastic endoprostheses. Conclusion: the combined radiological/endoscopic approach is often the only therapeutic option in patients with repeated injuries and com plete interruption of the biliary tract. This technique allowed the reconstitution o f biliary patency in all cases. However a longer follow-up is m andatory to assess the long-term patency of the biliary tract.1168 Polyurethane covered biliary wallstents in m alignant biliary obstruction -Closing remarks about a prospective pilotstudy K.A. Hausegger, S. Thurnher, J. Lammer, M. Uggowitzer, C. Kugler; Graz/A Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of polyurethane covered biliary Wallstents in treatm ent of malignant biliary obstructions. Methods and Material: The study com prises 27 patients with malignant ob structions of the common bile duct. None of them was a surgical candidate. Patients with hilar lesions were excluded. W e analyzed the time to a composite end point (i.e. stent occlusion, death and end of observation period) and the overall survival time. A partially polyurethane covered prototype Wallstent was used.Results: Technical success w as 100%. No early o r late adverse reaction was observed. No stent related com plication occurred. Mean survival time was 4.9 months with 2 patients still alive. Mean time to com posite endpoint was 4.3 months. Premature stent occlusion occurred in 7 patients after 1, 2 (n = 3), 3, 4 and 5 months. Histologically proven tum or ingrowth was the reason fo r occlusion in one patient, in the others the reason is unclear but probably caused by sludge and granulation tissue. Conclusion: In this pilot series the covered stent revealed similar results known for noncovered Wallstents. The covering did not prevent tumor-ingrowth in one patient. Possible explanations are tum or ingrowth from proximal or distal, partial dissolution of the covering o r simple disruption of the covering caused by mechanical alteration. This type of covering seems not to be beneficial.1169 Increased lesion size in RF liver ablation with liquid electrode Y. M ia o 1, Y. N i1, P. M u lie r2, J. Y u 1, A.L. B a e rt1, G. M a rchai1 ; 1 Leuven/B, 2 Minneapolis, MN/USA Purpose:To test the hypothesis that the size of ablated tissue in radio frequency (RF) therapy can be increased by infusing 5% hypertonic saline through a screw-tip hollow electrode and to visualize RF ablated lesion with MR imaging. Methods and Materials: RF tissue ablation of 180 sites was performed by using a screw-tip hollow electrode in 40 freshly excised swine livers. Under both power and tem perature control modes, the ablation effects without and with various regimes o f 5% hypertonic saline (1 ml/min) prior to and/or during the procedure were com pared by measuring the size of lesions at dissection and confirmed by T1 and T2 weighted MR imaging.Results:The maximal lesion diam eter of 5.5 cm w as reached at 30 W with saline infusion 1 minute prior to and during 12 minutes of ablation. The smaller sizes (p < 0.01 ) between 0.3 to 2.5 cm in diam eter were met with noninfusion o r preinfusion only groups. The RF ablation lesions appeared as hyper-and hypointense areas on T1 and T2 MR images respectively.Conclusion:The RF liver ablation lesion size can be increased in combination with saline infusion. Such ablated lesion can be visualized with MRI.1170 The m emotherm stent in m alignant biliary obstruction G. Gorin, P. Grelet; Bordeaux/F Purpose: Evaluation of a new Nitinol stent fo r treatm ent of malignant biliary obstruction. Methods and Materials: 42 patients aged 33 to 95 years were treated with the Memotherm stent during the past 18 months. The level of obstruction was a the liver hilum in 24 cases, in the mid commun bile duct in 10 patients and in the lower commune bile duct in 8 patients. Insertions of the metallic stents were performed in 31 patients in a one-stage procedure and in 11 patients in a two-stage procedure. Results: placement of endoprostheses w as successful in every patient. We did not see any case of stent migration. W e observed stent occlusion in about 25% o f cases with a median delay of 7 months. The majority of stents remained patent until the death of patients. Conclusion: placement of the memotherm stent in patients with non operable malignant bile obstruction is easy, safe and effective. Our results agreed with those previously reported after use of others metallic stents.",

Clinical diagnosis negated (182), confirmed (94), new diagnosis (26), reports changed diagnosis in 60 patients. Overall diagnostic value of abdominal ultrasonography was rated high. Discussion: A t several referrals ultrasonography was not expected to give a diagnosis. GPs had higher expectations on achievements than radiologists. Positive and negative results were regarded as valuable as both influenced on treatment o r further diagnostic work-up. It may be worth while to teach GPs true possibilities of abdominal ultrasonography to avoid possible overuse.1172 Abdominal bedside ultrasound in the diagnostic evaluation of ICU patients U. Linsenmaier, K. Schlichtenhorst, S. Schmidbauer, J. Rieger, \u0421. Rock, E. Mangel, K.J. Pfeifer; M unich/D Purpose: To assess the diagnostic value o f abdominal ultrasound performed as beside studies on ICU patients Material and Methods: In a prospective study between 08/94 and 07/95 446 ultrasound studies were evaluated in a consecutive series o f 118 ICU patients,Bedside studies were performed around-the-clock by the radiology staff. All studies were evaluated by technical data, study quality and relevant findings and were then further assessed jointly with the senior ICU staff for the therapeutic consequences and the need of further diagnostic. Statistical evaluation was done by SPSS. Results: Study quality w as good in 67%, fair in 31% and insufficient in 2%. Relevant pathological findings were obtained in n = 235 (52.8% ) o f the studies (abdominal fluid 81% , abscesses 11%, hematomas 8% ). Parenchymal organs showed between 62% (liver) and 7.1% (kidneys) positive findings; in 17% (n = 68) additional pathological findings could be dem onstrated. Studies were conclusive in 379 cases (85%) and had therapeutic consequences (55% conservative, 13% operative, 12.5% follow-up, additional diagnostic 4.5%) Conclusion: Abdominal US on ICU patients is an valuable and effective diagnostic mean in the evaluation and follow-up o f severely ill patients. 1173 Cholesterol polyps o f the gallbladder wall less than 1 cm; review of 12 years M. Tzalonikou, A. Antoniou, T. Vourtsi, A. Pafiti, G. Polymeneas, E. Kapsalaki; Athens/GR Purpose: Review of clinical, ultrasonographic and histopathological features o f cholesterol polyps less than 1 cm in 3.500 patients. Methods and Materials: 70,000 patients underwent abdominal ultrasound examination in our institution over a 12 year period. 3.500 patients were found to have polypoid lesions of the gallbladder smaller than 1 cm in diameter. In 60% of the cases more than one lesions were found. In most o f the cases (80%) there was no correlation to clinical sym ptom s and was an incidental finding. In 70% of the cases various types o f hyperlipidem ia coexisted. 144 patients underwent cholecystectomy. 81 patients were followed at regular time intervals. Results: In the group of surgically and histologically proven 144 cases, gallstones coexisted in 70% of the cases, single cholesterol polyp in 80% and multiple in 20%. In this group 40% o f the patients developed gallstones at different time intervals (5 -8 years). In tw o cases a true adenom a w as found. 81 cases are followed over a period of 12 years and no significant change in the number and diam eter of the lesions was found. Conclusion: Simple or multiple cholesterol polyps of less than 1 cm is usually an incidental finding, which is found in hyperlipid\u00e9mie patients.1174 Role of Levovist\u00ae sonography in the study of focal liver lesions R. Campani, A. Bozzini, O. Bottinelli, F. Calliada, L. M adonia; Pavia/I Purpose:Levovist\u00ae sonography increases diagnostic accuracy in tissue char acterization of focal liver diseases. Materials and Methods: we examined 46 patients with prim ary and secondary focal hepatic lesions diagnosed with C T and biopsy. W e studied vascular patterns inside and/or around the lesions before and after contrast injection. Results: In all patients we observed a marked intraparenchimal flow increase; flow inside the lesion w as mostly increased in HCCs (28 cases) and in cavernous angiomas (2 cases); limphomas localizations (3 cases) remained avascular even after contrast adm inistration; capillary angiom as (7 cases), even of moderate size, exhibited few vascular spots after contrast injection. Finally metastases (6 cases) exhibited different patterns: they were avascular in 4 cases and with sim ilar flow to HCCs in 2 cases. Conclusion: Levovist\u00ae increases conventional color D oppler specificity espe cially in the characterization of primary malignant hepatic lesions.1175 Hepatocellular carcinom a treated with chem o-em bolization: Levovist\u00ae echo-enhanced US vs. color Doppler US and spinal CT follow-up R.

Anguissola; Pavia/I Purpose: To determ ine the role of Levovist18 contrast enhanced US (CEUS) imaging modality in the follow-up of hepatocellular carcinom a (H C C ) treated with chemo-embolization (CE).Materials and Methods:Twenty patients with a single HCC (< 5 cm in diam eter) were included in this prospective study. Before and after treatm ent every patient was submitted to spiral CT, Color D oppler US (CDU) and Levovist\u00ae contrast enhanced US. C T and US (CDU and CEUS) studies were also performed 1, 3 and 6 m onths after therapy. Imaging findings were correlated with results of follow -up fine-needle biopsies (FNAB).Results: All \u041d\u0421\u0421 lesions (14 of 20) that were negative fo r malignant cells at follow -up FNAB, showed extensive necrosis on CT evaluations after therapy and absence of any vascular signal at CDU and CEUS examination. The remaining 6 HCC, in w hich com plete tum or necrosis was not obtained with PEI, were correctly identified by CEUS but showed complete absence of vascular signals at CDU examination performed at 1 and 3 months after treatm ent (false negative), showed non hom ogeneous enhancement at CT examination in 4 cases absent enhancem ent in 2 cases (false negative). Conclusion: CEUS imaging may be useful for evaluating the efficacy of CE determ ining tum or regression.1176 Evaluation of portal mean velocity w ith duplex-Doppler sonography after G lucagon test in patients with viral chronic hepatitis R. Basilico, F. Renda, L. Bailardi, E. Pizzigallo; Chieti/IPurpose:The quantitative evaluation of portal mean velocity with Duplex-Doppler Sonography (DDS) can be more accurately obtained when portal flow is submitted to a \"stress test\" which traditionally consists o f a com plete meal. However this test is limited by a difficult standardization so that we attempted to substitute it with a pharmacological test utilizing glucagon. Aim of this study w as to evaluate DDS m easurement of portal mean velocity after Glucagon test in patients with chronic diffuse liver disease. M aterials and Methods: W e have studied 44 patients at baseline (12 hours fasting) and during the first 10 minutes following i.v. injection of 1 mg of glucagon. These patients, affected by chronic diffuse liver disease and postinfective hepatitis fibrosis, were histologically divided in four groups by Scheuer score. Results: W e found a significantly different increase in portal mean velocity after glucagon administration in each group (p < 0.001). There was an inverse correlation between the grade of fibrosis and the increase of portal mean velocity in each patient. Conclusions: W e believe that \"glucagon test\" can be used in the follow up of patients with chronic diffuse liver diseases under therapy and in the early diagnosis o f increased intrahepatic resistances due to fibrosis.1177 Diagnosis and clinical classification of liver cirrhosis with the use of resistance index (R l) of hepatic artery V. Sotiropoulos, I. Minardos, A. Matzorou, G. Georgoulia, N. Karaglani, N. Kritikos, R Piperopoulos; Athens/GR Purpose:The purpose o f this study is to determ ine the usefulness of hepatic artery Rl as an additional criterion in the diagnosis and clinical classification of liver cirrhosis, since there is some discrepancy in the literature concerning its role.Methods and Materials:In the last 12 months we obtained the hepatic artery Rl in 61 cirrhotics (44 men, 17 women) aged 25 -81 years which was compared to the Rl o f 25 normal subjects. Clinical stage of the disease was estimated by Child-Pugh score. Results: We found a significant difference of mean Rl values between cir rhotics: 0.751 \u00b1 0.025 and controls: 0.712 \u00b1 0.205 (p < 0.006, Mann-Whitney rank test). Furthermore, higher Rl values correlated well with more severe dis ease (p < 0.0001, one-w ay ANOVA test). Using an Rl cutoff point of 0.75 the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value w as 59%, 88% , 91 % and 46% respectively.Conclusion:In conclusion, we believe that Rl of the hepatic artery is a useful factor in the diagnosis and evaluation of liver cirrhosis. We note that the work is still in progress.1178 D iscrepancy between portal vein flow velocity and hepatic portal vein gradient in patients with cirrhosis V. Migaleddu, A. Deplano, A. Pischedda, A. Solinas, M. Picciau, G. Gregu, G.C. Canalis; Sardegna/I Purpose: In patients with cirrhosis, relationship between hepatic portal vein gradient (HPVG) and portal vein flow velocity (PVFV) is unclear. W e compared these variables in 18 patients with cirrhosis; (\"Child\" A = 12, \u0412 = 5, \u0421 = 1) positive fo r anti-HCV and HCV-RNA and negative fo r other etiological factors. Material and Methods: All patients had clinical evidence of portal hypertension (splenomegaly; and/or platelet count < 130 x 103 \u03bc \u0390 ; and/or esophageal varices). HPVG was determ ined by ultrasound guided fine needle puncture of hepatic and portal veins. In the setting o f post viral cirrhosis, this technique is more appropriate, as the conventional hepatic vein balloon catheterization underestimates HPVG in 50% of cases. Hepatic and portal veins pressures were measured by Statham transducer, registered by m ultichannel polygraph. PVFV was evaluated by duplex color Doppler. Mean maximum PVFV values used were the mean of three recordings. Results: Mean PVP, HPVG, PVFV were 20.1 \u00b1 7.6 9,16 .7 \u00b1 5.84 mm Hg, 16.4 \u00b1 4.91 m/sec. A decreasing trend of PVFV was observed when PVP and HPVG increased. This weak relationship is fa r from statistical significance (r = -0 .3 4 6 p = 0.15 between PVP and PVFV and r = -0 .1 2 p = 0.61 between HPVG and PVFV). Conclusions: These data indicate that, in patients with cirrhosis type \u0421 and portal hypertension, changes in PVFV do not linearly reflect those in HPVG. 1179 Power Doppler US in the evaluation o f portal venous system: Clinical experience and correlation with color Doppler US P. Ricci, G. Pizzi, V. Pedicini, M. Coniglio, A. Russo, P. Rossi; Rome/I Purpose: to identify clinical applications and determ ine the usefulness of power Doppler US in the evaluation o f portal venous system, in comparison with conventional Doppler US. Materials and Methods: 55 consecutive patients were routinely investigated by using high-resolution gray-scale US, standard color Doppler and power Doppler US, before and/or after TIPS placement. C onventional color Doppler and power Doppler US were com pared in the evaluation of: a) partial/complete thrombosis o f the portal vein; b) portal cavernom atosis; c) patency of paraum bilical veins; d) partial/complete thrombosis o f the hepatic vein; e) thrombosis of the inferior vena cava; f) stenosis/occlusion of TIPS. Results: power Doppler US assessed com plete o r residual patency of the portal vein in 11 cases, previously depicted as partial (8) o r com plete (3) throm bosis at color Doppler. It showed portal patency in one of the caver nomatosis and distal recanalization in 2 cases. Seven paraumbilical veins were assessed by power Doppler Us as well as by color Doppler, while in 3 cases the presence and patency were demonstrated only at power Doppler. Power Doppler also confirmed the com plete throm bosis of the hepatic veins in 4 cases, while in 2 It showed normal patency. Finally tw o cases o f patency of the inferior vena cava where showed only at power Doppler. In the evaluation o f TIPS status power Doppler was very useful, showing com plete obstruc tion in 5 cases, focal stenosis (including assessment o f site, extension and morphology) in 11 and com plete patency in 21. Conclusions: power Doppler US findings enables better assessment of portal venous system, enhancing and expanding the capabilities of diagnostic US. Power Doppler is more sensitive in depicting patency o r thrombosis than conventional color Doppler. 1180 US and Doppler features of ectopic splenic tissue after splenectomy for trauma C. Ricci, M.

Hatjikondi, P. Ravazoula, T. Petsas, D. Siamblis, E. Tzorakolefterakis, J. Dimopoulos; Patras/GR Purpose: In a previous study, in rats with experimental liver metastases, we found that Color Doppler Vascular Studies can clearly depict hepatic haemodynamic changes related with the presence of early, neoplastic cell deposits. The purpose of this prospective study is to determ ine the alterations that Adriamycin may induce in the liver haemodynam ics of these animals. Materials and Methods: Two groups o f W istar rats, with experimental liver metastases (Walker 256 carcinosarcoma), are used in this project. In the first group, Adriamycin is injected as a single IV dose of 20 mg/kg on the 5th day of metastatic process, while in the second group an identical dose is given on the 7th day of metastatic disease. Eventually each group is divided into two subgroups and Doppler measurements (consisting of Doppler Perfusion Index [DPI] of the liver and Portal vein and Hepatic artery Flow Volume [PFV, HFV]) are obtained one day (1st subgroup) and three days (2nd subgroup) after the drug injection. All livers are examined histologically soon after each measurement. Other factors such us liver parenchymal oedema and inflammatory process as well as cardiotoxicity due to the chemotherapeutic agent and their haemodynam ic influence are also under long term investigation in our study. Results: Thirty six animals have been studied so far, 20 in the 1st group (11/9 in subgroups) and 16 in the 2nd (9/7 in subgroups). In all livers Adriamycin provoked strong suppression and decrease of the metastatic cells to a level similar to the early metastatic infiltration of the liver connective tissue by isolated cells. The haemodynam ic indices, in both groups, show a characteristic fluctuation with tendency of normalization of the DPI and PFV values one day after drug administration and return to abnormal levels three days after. The variance o f these values found to be significant (p values: 0.0254 and 0.0128 respectively). In contrast, HFV values have not shown yet significant differences. Conclusion: Our initial results strongly suggest that liver haemodynamic indices are not only good predictors o f occult hepatic metastases, but they may also monitor the drug activity on liver metastatic disease. An integrated aspect on this issue is expected when this project will be completed.HEAD AND NECK 1709 Im aging o f the ear Chairpersons: A. CHIESA (Brescia/I) P.A. DIMOPOULOS (Patras/GR) C.

Kubilis; Gent/B Purpose: To determine the normal variation in the CT appearance of the middle ear ligaments and the stapedius tendon. Methods and Materials: C T studies of the tem poral bone, using 1 mm thick sections, performed in 75 normal middle ears, were reviewed by tw o observers rating the visualization of the structures of interest on a 1 to 5 scale.Results: The anterior, superior and lateral malleal ligam ents and the medial and lateral parts o f the posterior incudal ligament were visualized in 68%, 46%, 95%, 26% and 34% o f cases respectively. The stapedius tendon was seen in 27% of cases. W hen visible, the ligam ents were judged to be complete in 90-100% of cases and the visualization of the stapedius tendon w as complete in 65% of cases. Their width varied considerably. Although the interobserver agreement is statistically significant fo r most study parameters, the degree of agreement above that expected by chance is low. Conclusion: CT more likely demonstrates the malleal than the incudal middle ear ligaments. W hen seen, the ligam ents usually appear complete. The stapedius tendon is seen in 27% o f cases.SS1183 The role of CT in diagnosing internal carotid artery (IC A ) aplasia S.H. E rb a y ' , M.

Our purpose was to test \"steadystate\" imaging sensibility in detecting inner ear malformations. Material and Methods: Over a population of 808 patients suffering from sensory-neural hearing loss (SNHL), 17 patients affected by labyrinthine d e fects underwent neuroradiological studies in tw o different departments, using high resoluted \"steady-state\" imaging on middle and high field units. Two-and three-dim ensional reconstructions using Maximum Intensity Projection were also performed.

The phantoms shall be used for a scanner's performance evaluation and quality contol. Methods and Materials: Low contrast resolution constitutes one of the basic performance parameters of Computed Tomography systems. The com m er cially available LC-phantoms are not satisfactory, because their object contrast depends on tem perature and X-ray quality. W e used polyurethane based solid materials with w ater-equivalent X-ray attenuation and thermal properties to build LC phantoms. The phantom fo r 2D measurements contains tw o sets of periodic rods with diameters from 3 to 7 mm and a contrast of 3 HU and 5 HU respectively. The 3D phantom contains rows of spheres with diam eters from 3 mm to 6 mm and a contrast o f 5 HU. Results: Both phantoms allow to measure LC resolution reliably. The two different contrast values of the 2D phantom allow to calculate resolution values for an intermediate contrast, e.g. 4 HU, to com pare results to m anufacturer's specifications. The LC resolution in 3D, which is of specific interest in spiral CT volum etric imaging, has not been assessed before.1195 Im aging of the heart by ECG-oriented reconstruction from subsecond spiral CT scans W.A. Kalender, A. Polacin; Erlangen/D Purpose: To develop a new z-interpolation algorithm utilizing ECG information fo r im aging of the heart and to evaluate the image quality achievable with such dedicated reconstructions. Materials and Methods: We modified spiral CT z-interpolation algorithm s on a subsecond spiral CT scanner (Somatom Plus 4, Siemens, Erlangen) to recon struct partial scans of 180\u00b0 + fan angle or less, resulting in effective scan times of < 0.5 s. The new algorithm applies piecewise linear interpolation to spiral data segments belonging to the same heart cycle. Segm ents are determ ined by correlation with a simultaneously recorded ECG signal. Com puter sim ula tion, phantom experim ents as well as processing of clinical data collected with 0.75 s and 1 s scan time were carried out to evaluate this new method. Results: ECG-oriented modified z-interpolation provides significant im prove ments in image quality fo r simulations, phantom m easurem ents and clinical studies. Inconsistency artifacts in the image plane are nearly eliminated; vol ume representations are almost free from 'stepping' artifacts.

M ethods and Materials: Low-dose HR-CT-scans of the petrous bone dis played with different w indow values were analyzed for identification of osseous details. For 2 hom ogenous phantoms, standard deviation of CT values were measured in order to calculate the fraction of pixels not displayed in the correct grey level. Results: T he broadest window used (4000 HU) allowed the best distinction of osseous structures. Standard deviation of CT-values in the phantoms varied between 28.5 and 43.2 (mean = 33.6) HU. On the basis of 88 grey levels distinguishable by human eyes, only 26.6% of all pixels are displayed in the correct grey level fo r a 1000 HU-window, but 82.3% fo r a 4000 HU-window. Conclusions: For low doses and HR-reconstruction algorithms, large window w idths allow an optimal assessment o f bony structures. Enlargment of window width permits to reduce considerably radiation dose to be applied. Due to the quadratic relation between w indow width and dose applied, a change in w indow w idth from 2000 to 4000 HU permits to reduce the irradiation to 25% of the initial value when image quality is kept constant.1199 Radiation dose from electron beam com puter tom ography (EBCT) com pared to spiral/helical CT in pulmonary em bolism (PE) studies R.

The standard EBCT protocol fo r the PE study, single slice mode 100 ms 630 mA 6 mm, w as com pared to the Spiral/Helical protocol 145 mAs, 8 mm slice-thickness, 10 mm table-feed. Results: The effective dose fo r EBCT w as 3.2 mSv (male) and 3.4 mSv (fe male). These values are in the same range as those for spiral/helical scanning protocols (3.8 mSv fem ale, 3.2 mSv male). The only significant difference is in the dose gradient which increases dorsally due to the 210 degree beam excursion as com pared to the radial symm etry of the spiral/helical CT.Conclusion: The overall effective dose fo r the PE protocols in EBCT and spiral/helical C T is comparable.

Schulz; Leipzig/D Purpose: CT exam inations became the m ajor source of radiation exposure in diagnostic radiology. Possibilities decreasing individual radiation exposure will be demonstrated. Methods and Materials: Typical spiral CT examination procedures of chest, abdomen and pelvis were analyzed with regard to indication, changing equip ment performance, organ doses using conversion factors (M onte Carlo calcu lations) and effective dose (ICRP 60). Results: Decreased radiation exposure is the outcom e of reduced scan vol ume, increased pitch, reduced mAs, renunciation of unnecessary examination procedures, i.e. series without contrast medium, and individual adaptation of scan param eters in relation to body habitus: Radiation exposure of a slim pa tient could be a quater of that of a very corpulent patient. Selected examples will be demonstrated. Conclusion: Indication, body region, individual patient particularities and equipment performance lead to a trade-off between image quality and radiation exposure. The choice o f imaging param eters require a qualified guidance of examinations by the radiologist.

Materials and Methods: A mobile C T unit (Philips Medical Systems, Nether lands) was used to scan 250 patients (125 with power supply, 125 without) in either the chest, abdomen, pelvis, or paranasal sinus region. W ith respect to high and low contrast resolution and artifacts, com parable incremental exam inations from the mobile scanner and from 3 stationary C T units(SR 7000,  Somatom Plus, PQ 2000; Philips, Siemens, Picker Medical Systems)  were ranked by 2 radiologists on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the best. For 20 patients, the CT-M was brought to the em ergency or operating room. Results: No difference w as noted between scans obtained with power or battery supply. Despite the low er energy range used with CT-M (20 to 200 mAs; others: 50 to 300 mAs), no difference in low-contrast resolution and artifacts was noted (p < 0.05, p < 0.001, respectively). For applications requiring high spatial resolution (bones, HR-chest), CT-M was ranked interiorly (CT-M: 3.2; others: 1.3; p < 0.001).

MASCIOCCHI (L'Aquila/l) 1203 Overload disorders in sports activities (sum mary) C. Masciocchi, L. Zugaro; L'A quila/lIn athletes, osteochondral, tendineous and synovial pathologies can occur as result of biomechanical overload. The stress fractures occur as a consequence of microtraumatic events and biom echanical overload. If misdiagnosed, these lesions are cause of painful syndrome and functional disability. Conventional techniques such as plain films and C T allow a good evaluation of stress fractures; MR imaging has proved to be particularly accurate in the diagnosis, especially fo r the early evaluation o f bone edema on T2 weighted sequences. Concerning osteochondral diseases, from the ethiological point of view, the biomechanical overload seems to be the main cause. Functional overload induces changes both in the cartilaginous com ponent and the subchondral bone. The knee and subtalar joints can be usually affected by osteochondral pathology. MRI has a higher sensitivity in identifying such pathological con ditions over other imaging techniques including CT, which, although able to visualize severe alterations, does not allow evaluation o f early subchondral le sions. Meniscal tears represent the most common cause of pain and functional disability o f the knee in athletes. B etter than other diagnostic techniques, MRI allows visualization of such structures on axial and longitudinal scan planes. Due to high spatial and contrast resolution and multiplanar imaging it is possible by means of MRI to distinguish different types of meniscal lesion. Tendinous diseases are common occurrences in sports. The \"overuse injuries\" are the most frequent to record as a consequence of repetitive microtrau mas. Tendon injuries can further be divided into acute, subacute and chronic. Tendon's injuries sites change in connection to the different sport practised. Synovial pathology may be the effect of overload o r repeated microscopic le sions. Acute o r chronical synovial disease concerning joints, bursae o r tendon sheaths, if not diagnosed, are causes o f athletic capacity reduction. Available imaging methods in tendinous and synovial disease include ultrasound, CT and MRI. MRI has the greatest potential utility in the evaluation o f tendon because o f its numerous advantages.

It is the only noninvasive imaging method which is capable of depicting joints and their various components, including fibrocartilage and hyaline cartilage. Conventional pulse sequences may be utilized to visualize fibrocartilage, the most common being the menisci in the knees and the shoulder glenoid labrum. However conventional pulse sequences offer relatively poor image contrastfor articular cartilage and poor sensitivity fo r the depiction o f diseased cartilage. An improved discrimination of the state o f articular cartilage may be obtained by utilizing newer pulse sequences. An important cause of knee pain is hyaline cartilage defects. Such pain may be confused clinically with meniscal pathology. Recent advances in imaging of such lesions has em ployed fat-suppressed spoiled gradiant-echo (SPGR) and subtraction magnetization-transfer contrast-enhanced (STS) se quences. These techniques depict hyaline cartilage with positive contrast (higher signal intensity) relative to adjacent structures. Encouraging results have been demonstrated for imaging hyaline cartilage defects in the knee us ing thin-partitioned three-dimensional (3D) SPGR imaging. Saturation transfer is designed to selectively saturate short T2 species with restricted mobility associated with macromolecules, resulting in decreased signal intensity of cartilage, thereby increasing contrast-to-noise ratio between cartilage and joint fluid. Compared to conventional pulse sequences these tw o techniques have demonstrated superior depiction of articular cartilage lesions, showing good corroboration with arthroscopy and gross specim ens. Detection of hyaline car tilage abnorm alities is im portant because they may only otherwise be detected arthroscopically. Since newer therapeutic options are now available MR may play an important role in the noninvasive diagnosis and follow -up of such lesions. Tendinous degeneration A.M. Davies; Birmingham /UK Tendons are the tough inelastic, cords o f fibrous tissue that connect muscles with the structures to be moved, such as the bones and cartilages. Acute tears most com monly occur at the osseo-tendinous junction and are frequently accompanied by a small avulsion fracture. Less com monly tears occur at the musculo-tendinous junction. Chronic injuries also occur at the osseo-tendinous junction but may arise within the substance of the tendon itself. Before the advent of cross-sectional imaging little interest was paid to tendon pathology. Identification o f tendon abnorm ality relied on secondary signs such as avulsion fractures or indirect imaging with tenography o r bursography.

Patients: We report on eight patients with AE with bone or soft tissue involvement confirmed at biopsy or needle cytology.Results: All eight patients with AE showed hepatic involvement. Four of eight patients with AE exhibited infiltration o f the spine as a result o f direct spread of the hepatic primary lesion; distant m etastases were observed in only three of these patients. Calcifications, w hich are typical for hepatic m anifestations of the disease, were observed in soft tissue in only tw o of eight cases (25%); we observed no instances of endovesicular daughter cysts. Conclusion: Alveolar echinococcosis manifests itself in the vertebral column as a form of spondylitis and in soft tissue presents similar to an abscess.

Methods and Materials: Prospectively, both hands (MCPJ, IPJ) o f 45 patients with early RA (mean duration of disease 5.4 months) and 9 controls underwent coronal and axial MRI (1.5 T. 8 x 8 cm wrist coil) with T2w, T1 w and Gd-DTPA enhanced T1w sequences at baseline, after 6 and 12 months. Two-plane standard radiographs were taken as well. Each joint was evaluated according to a MR scoring system (score 0 -7 ) and the Larsen score (conventional radiographs).Results:The following baseline MR patterns were found in 540 joints: normal joint (48%); synovialitis with linear enhancem ent (42%); capsular thickening w ith/without enhancement (3%); focal inflammatory osseous changes (6%); diffuse osseous changes (1%).

Acute synovitis was indicated by a peri-articular enhancement at MRI; this w as correlated with the radiographic grading, scintigraphic findings and laboratory data. Results: Periarticular enhancement at MRI was observed in all patients with acute arthralgia (9); this was more evident at the sites where bone abnormalities were shown by radiographs and was positively correlated (R = 0.90) with increased uptake at the perfusional phase of the bone scan. No enhancement and a normal perfusional phase of the bone scan were observed in the 3 patients in clinical remission. In all patients, both ESR and CRP were elevated, irrespectively to disease activity. Conclusions: In our preliminary series, no additional information seemed to be provided by MRI; however, this modality allow s both a morphologic and functional evaluation o f joint damage in patients with RA.1215 Efficacy o f m agnetic resonance imaging with Gd-DTPA in the following of rheumatoid arthritis of knee after m odifying treatm ent of the disease N. Gomez Le\u00f3n, C. Vicandi, M. Ramos, P. Torres, G. Candelas, A. Garcia Vadillo; Madrid/E Purpose: To determ ine w hether the Resonance Magnetic Imaging (MRI) can detect associated changes o f modifying treatm ent of the disease.Material and Methods: 33 patients diagnosted of early rheum atoid arthritis were evaluated, with average age o f 61 years, a t the beggining and 6 months after modifying treatm ent of the disease. In all patients w as done clinic examination, laboratory tests and MRI with 0.5 Teslas magneton unit (Toshiba MAT-50). Continuos axial and sagittal T1 weigthed spin echo images (5 0 0 /1 5 -17/4 repetition time msec/slice thickness mm) were obtein of joint before and 5 minutes after i.v. Gadolinium-DTPA inyection. Effusion, synovial hipertrophy and subchondral and bone changes were evaluated. Results: Effusion volum e before treatment was 13.96 \u00b1 15.3 ml and after 6.94 \u00b1 11.18 ml. Synovial hipertrophy volum e before treatm ent w as 34 \u00b1 19.66 ml and after 20.33 \u00b1 16.30 ml. Changes in the average of effusion (P = 0.002) and synovial hipertrophy (P < 0.001) were statistically correlated. W e don't prove cartilagenous changes (P = 0.19) and we do in subchondral and bone (P < 0.01).Conclusion: Measurements of effusion and synovial volum es by MRI evaluate the response of modifying treatm ent o f the disease. 1216 Power Doppler sonography in detection of periarticular hyperem ia in rheumatoid arthritis J. Krejza, A. Kuryliszyn-Moskal, J. Polakow, R. Tolwinski, S. Szulc; Bialystok/PL Purpose: Assessment of the value of power Doppler sonography in detection of hyperem ia in swollen periarticular tissue in active stages o r rheumatoid arthritis. In active disease there is soft tissue and synovial proliferation in the vicinity of the joints affected which provide increased blood flow through the swollen soft tissue. Materials and Methods: 41 patients com plied with generally accepted criteria fo r active rheumatoid arthritis and 30 healthy volunteers were evaluated with gray-scale and power Doppler sonography. Swollen and asym ptom atic joints o f the hand were examined. Results: Soft tissue hyperemia w as seen on power Doppler sonogram s in the swollen joints in 38 patients. Hyperemia was characterized by subjectively and significant increase in the quantity of identifiable vessels (color dots) within synovial and pericapsular tissue. Conclusion: Power Doppler sonography is effective in evaluation hyperem ia associated with active rheumatoid arthritis in the swollen soft periarticular tissue and could play important role in early diagnosis o f the disease even before and definite bone changes become visible. 1217 High resolution and power Doppler US im aging of the synovial pannus of the w rist In patients with rheumatic diseases E.

Cangelosi; Genova/I Purpose: To evaluate the imaging findings in com plications after reduction gastroplasty with adjustable gastric banding. Materials and Methods: W e reviewed the imaging findings in 36 morbid obese patients after restriction gastroplasty obtained according the Kuzmak technique. Radiographic studies of the stom ach were obtained before, and at 6 and 12 month after surgery. Symptomatic patients underwent additional radiographic and sonographic evaluation w hen needed. Results: Normal clinical and radiographic findings were observed in 17 pa tients. Six patients had infection of the reservoir, with cutaneous fistulas; two had infection of the surgical wound; tw o had esophageal and gastric erosions; three had cranial dislocation of the gastric banding; six had stenosis and dilatation of the proximal gastric pouch. In these cases, radiography was used to guide adjustment o f the silicone banding. Sonography was employed to obtain access to the reservoir in infected and edem atous wounds. Conclusions: Imaging techniques play an im portant role in evaluating com plications after gastric reduction surgery. Knowing the variety o f findings helps to plan accurately treatm ent and follow -up of these patients.1233 \" Early\" gastric cancer: Should we revise our diagnostic approach? L.M. Portnoi, I.A. Kazantseva, V.A. Isakov, V.l. Nefedova, E.V. Chikunova; M oscow/CISGastric cancer is still one of the highly ranked malignancies with high mortality rate. For increasing the efficacy of diagnosis we have analyzed the results of our screening program. During the 15 years we have examined 36000 patients from the risk groups who were included into the screening program for gastric cancer. The screening program included classic gastric radiography (tight filling and double-contrast) every year with subsequent endoscopy with multiple biopsy where needed. In difficult fo r interpretation cases we used dynamic CT with air distention o f the stom ach. 680 gastric cancers were found. 170 patients (25%) had early gastric cancers with size less than 3 cm. 120 (70.5%) of these patients had type lib (flat) lesions which were the most difficult to detect by endoscopy (only in 15 patients endoscopic diagnosis was correct). In most of these patients small contour irregularity during the tight filling radiography was the only feature to suspect gastric malignancy. In 118 of 120 patients dynamic CT o f the stomach with air distention revealed local S244 thickening of the stomach wall. The size o f the tum or determ ined by CT was totally confirmed in 106 patients by surgery, so the predictive value of CT with air distention was 89.8%. In the rest 12 patients C T decreased the real size of the tumor, probably, due to inadequate stomach distention. In conclusion, the type lib (flat) lesion is the most frequent type o f early gastric cancer. These tumors are the most difficult fo r endoscopic diagnosis, so the classic gastric radiography (tight filling and double-contrast) and if necessary subsequent CT with air distention of the stomach are the methods of choice in diagnosis of such tumors. Using this approach can increase diagnostic efficacy of early gastric cancer.1234 Spiral CT of the stomach in patients with gastric cancer S. K\u00f6sling, K. Steingr\u00fcber, P. B\u00f6rner, P. Emmrich; Leipzig/D P urpose: To evaluate spiral CT in patients with suspected gastric cancer (g.c.). Methods and Materials: 234 patients underwent contrast enhanced Spiral CT. Scans were reviewed for identification, characterization and staging of the lesion. The CT results were com pared with endoscopic (n = 224), radiographic (n = 134), surgical (n = 151) and histological findings (n=115). G.c. was proven in 171 patients. Results: A lesion was prospectively found in 95.9% of cases with g.c. (in 63.2% of early g.c.). The lesion was suspicious for g.c. in 91.8%. Compared with histology, there was a correct T staging in 83% (in 92.7% of pT3/pT4) and a correct N staging in 89%. A lesion by lesion analysis of regional lymph nodes (n = 51) showed that in spite of the reached accuracy only 65% of all lymph nodes were visible by CT. The M staging by CT was correct in 12 of 16 cases. Differences in enhancement of g.c. were found according to classification by Laur\u00e8n. CT and endoscopy showed a sensitivity o f 91% and 99% and a specificity of 90% and 40% in diagnosis of g.c.Conclusion: Spiral C T clearly improves the preoperative staging of g.c., especially in advanced cases. It should be performed directly after endoscopy.1235 TNM-staging o f gastric carcinom as by helical hydro-CT M. D\u00fcz, G.M. Richter, J. Hansm ann, Chr. Kuntz, G.W. Kauffmann; Heidelberg/D Purpose: to assess the potential of Helical Hydro-CT (HHCT) fo r the preoper ative TNM-staging of gastric carcinomas. Materials and Methods: 105 patients with suspected gastric carcinomas were examined by HHCT. For distension of the bowel wall water was given orally.To optimize parenchymal and vessel contrast bolus tracking was done before spiral scanning of the upper abdomen began. If imaging criteria suggested a gastric malignancy TNM -staging was performed. Results were correlated with histopathologic findings. Results: HHCT correctly identified 90% of all gastric carcinomas. T-staging was correct in 62%, N-staging in 69% and abdominal M-staging in 76% of all cases. Conclusions: HHCT is a reliable procedure to diagnose gastric malignancies. Only small T1-carcinomas may be missed by HHCT. Although distinction between T2-and \u0422\u0417-carcinom as with serosal infiltration is limited HHCT is a valuable staging tool fo r gastric carcinomas. Especially T4-carcinomas as well as local and distant metastases are reliably diagnosed.1236 18FDG PET in gastric non-Hodgkin's lymphoma M. Rodriguez, H. Ahlstr\u00f6m, A. Sundin, S. Rehn, C.

Effective imaging must be tailored to the clinical pattern of visual loss. For presumed ocular causes, sonography is the investigation o f choice, followed in some cases by MRI. Optic nerve lesions can som etimes be localised clinically to the intraocular, intraorbital, intracanalicular or intracranial portions o f the nerve. CT and/or MRI may be combined to clarify the nature and extent of involvement. When optic neuropathy is part of a more generalised disorder, such as multiple sclerosis, w ider imaging of the CNS may be necessary. Vascular accidents involving the eye and optic nerve require reliable noninvasive imaging of the extracranial cervical arteries.

The potential validity o f our therapeutic concept has to be proven in appropriated random ized studies. Purpose: Our aim was to treat single > 3 cm., or multiple hepatocellular carci nomas (HCCs) by interstitial laser photocoagulation (ILP) alone o r associated with trans-arterial chemo-embolization (TACE). Methods: Twenty patients with HCCs (52 lesions, diam eters: 2 0 -6 0 mm.) were treated by ILP. A 1.06 \u0434 \u0442 Nd:YAG laser coupled with 300 \u0434 \u0442 quartz fiberoptic guide advanced in a 21 G needle. Laser was fired for 8 -1 0 minutes (5 -1 0 W). Each lesion received 4 -1 0 treatm ents in 2 -5 sessions. TACE was performed on the lesions showing areas of viable tum or not treatable by further ILP. During follow-up (1 2 -1 8 months) CT and US were repeated every 3 months. Results: Post-treatment CT scan and core biopsy demonstrated com plete necrosis in the lesions < 3 cm (28 lesions) and variable degree of necrosis in the lesions > 3 cm. After TACE residual neoplastic tissue showed lipiodol retention. During follow -up period lesions treated by ILP and TACE were stable while 3/7 lesions > 3 cm. treated only by ILP showed local recurrence managed by further ILP. Conclusion: ILP is effective in treating small HCCs. In large o f multifocal HCCs it is useful in reducing neoplastic volum e and the num ber of viable lesions and, consequently, the required am ount of chem oem bolic agents and the number o f hepatic segments needing treatment. Purpose: Evaluation o f radiation dose of a digital chest radiography system using am orpheus selenium as X-ray detector com pared to conventional plain film chest radiography. M aterial and Methods: 220 posteroanterior (p.a.) and lateral chest radio graphs were obtained from 110 patients in conventional and digital technique, using the selenium detector. Technical parameters were standardized for both techniques. Patient's surface radiation dose was measured and compared. Results: The mean radiation dose of plain film radiography was 0.0173 cGy (range: 0 .0 041 -0.0 89 cGy, Standard deviation (SD): 0.0151 cGy) for the p.a. and 0.07203 cGy (range: 0.0 15-0.23 8 cGy, SD: 0.02151 cGy) for the lateral projection. The mean radiation dose of the selenium detector was 0.006823 cGy (range: 0.002-0.051 cGy, SD: 0.00643 cGy) in p.a. and 0.01678 cGy (range: 0.0 039-0.0712 cGy, SD: 0.0122 cGy) in lateral projections, respectively. Student t-test (p < 0.05) proved significant differences between both techniques. Conclusion: Compared to conventional chest radiography radiation dose is reduced by the new digital chest radiography system with amorpheus selenium as X-ray detector. Purpose: to evaluate the impact of increased matrix size and improved quantum detection on the perform ance of digital systems M aterials and Methods: D etection of four types of simulated pulmonary lesions (nodules, lines, m icronodules and large low contrast objects) were com pared by Jackknife ROC methodology (p < 0.05). Storage phosphor plates (ST V, 4 \u041a matrix, Fuji, Japan), selenium radiography (Thoravision, Philips, Germany) and a 400 speed conventional screen-film system (Kodak TM L film) served as detectors and were all exposed with identical parameters. Results: The overall detection performance (ROC area) was equivalent with all system s (0.81 vs. 0.83 vs. 0.83). The selenium detector was significantly superior to the conventional system in the detection of low contrast opacities (0.85 vs. 0.80) and lines (0.84 vs. 0.78) but was inferior in the detection of m ediastinal nodules. The storage phosphor system was superior to the other system s fo r the detection of mediastinal nodules but inferior to the conventional system in the detection o f m icronodules (0.81 vs. 0.83). Conclusion: The overall perform ance with both digital system s was equivalent to conventional radiography. Selenium has advantages fo r the detection o f fine and low-contrast pulm onary structures while the newest generation of storage phosphor plates is optim um fo r the mediastinum. com pared by Jackknife ROC methodology (p < 0.05). 4 \u041a storage phosphor radiographs (ST V, full size hardcopy) were com pared to 2 \u041a storage phosphor radiographs (ST V, two/third size hardcopy) and conventional film s (Kodak TML, regular screen) using a 400 speed exposure dose. Results: There were no significant differences between the detection perfor mance (ROC areas) of 2 \u041a and 4 \u041a storage phosphor radiographs for nodules (0.80 vs. 0.83), lines (0.84 vs. 0.83) and m icronodules (0.77 vs. 0.77). Large low contrast opacities were seen better with the 2 \u041a images (.87 vs. 0.83). Storage phosphor radiographs of both matrices were inferior (p < 0.05) to conventional radiographs in the detection of m icronodules (0.77 vs. 0.77 vs. 0.80). Conclusion: Increased matrix size does not improve the detection perfor mance of simulated chest lesions. The detection of low contrast structures is still the most critical task in digital chest radiography. Detection o f large low contrast objects deteriorated in the 4 \u041a images due to the higher conspicuity of image noise in the larger image format. To compare softcopy-and hardcopy reading of chest radiographs a software tool was designed fo r creating lesions with clearly defined size, location and contrast. Methods and Materials: An ROC study was performed using a set of chest radiographs with 300 simulated small nodules and linear details displayed on film and on a 1 \u041a monitor. Six experienced radiologists participated in the study. ROC curves were generated on the basis o f 7200 decisions. Results: There was no significant difference in observer performance overall (AUC, Mon.: 0.85 \u00b1 0.08 vs. AUC, Film: 0.84 \u00b1 0.08). Slight, but not statistical significant differences were found in the detection o f low-contrast lung nodules (AUC, Mon.: 0.86 \u00b1 0.11 vs. AUC, Film: 0.82 \u00b1 0.12) and in the detection of linear lung details (AUC, Film: 0.85 \u00b1 0.07 vs. AUC, Mon.: 0.82 \u00b1 0.07). Conclusion: Softcopy reading using a high quality 1 \u041a C RT display provides the same accuracy for the detection of subtle com putersimulated lesions as hard copy reading. A software tool could be used fo r assigning optimal characteristics of CRT-and hardcopy displays using clearly defined lesions as a gold standard.",

Additionally, spatial resolution was measured. Results: W ith increasing speed spatial resolution decreased (CO 200: 3.0, CO 400: 2.3, CO 600: 2.0 Ip/mm). Observer performance for all lesion types was neither significantly different com paring C O 200 vs. C O 400 nor CO 400 vs. CO 600. CO 600, however, showed a significant inferior detectability of lines and micronodules com pared to C O 200 (p < 0.01).

Clinical importance o f digital thorax X-rays fo r detection of infectious o r non infectious lung infiltrations was verified. Methods and Materials: 40 patients with bone marrow transplantation in aplasia, age > 18, fever of unknown origin and normal thorax X-ray before transplantation were evaluated prospectively concerning manifestation of lung infiltrations in correlation to clinical findings (temperature, bloods, microbiology, auscultation, bronchoscopy). Results: 27.5% (n = 11) developed lung infiltration in digital thorax X-ray, whereas clinical findings indicated infectious lung infiltrations in only 15% (n = 6; 3 fungoid, 1 bacterial, 2 not specified). Clinical findings as increase of temperature, CRP, antibody titer occurred in average 6 d before lung infiltration in digital thorax X-ray.

Galanski; Hannover/D Purpose: To determ ine the impact of different scan protocols and reconstruc tion modes on depiction of the tracheobronchial system (TBS). Materials and Methods: A porcine model was used fo r systematic variation of scan protocols: 1 -5 mm slice collimation (SC), 1 -8 mm table feed (TF), and 1 -2 mm reconstruction interval (Rl). The detected volum e and the total length of detected bronchi were used fo r quality assessment of the 3D reconstructions. To ensure reproducible and objective evaluation, an automatic algorithm was applied fo r segmentation of the TBS. Results: The use of SC > 3 mm produced substantial decrease of visible branching -only 2nd order bronchi could be accurately visualized. If Rl was reduced from 2 mm to 1 mm, an average increase of 47% in length of detected bronchi and 21% in bronchial volum e could be achieved. Applying a pitch > 1 further increased the length of detected bronchi on average by 22% (for SC < 2 mm). Given these protocols, pathologic findings could be reliably displayed up to 3rd-order bronchi and up to 5th order bronchi could be visualized. Conclusion: For optimal display of bronchial anatomy, SC should not exceed 2 mm, and a pitch > 1 should be used. An Rl of 1 mm o r smaller is recommended. Computed tom ography (CT) has greater sensitivity than chest radiography (CXR) fo r the detection o f focal and multifocal lung pathology.

Two observers independently reviewed CTs and CXRs on dif ferent occasions, in random order. For each examination observers assigned up to three diagnoses, assigning a level o f confidence (1 = confident, 2 = less confident) to the first choice diagnosis. Results: Histological confirmation of the aetiology o f MC w as available in 32 cases (organizing pneumonia, n = 9; alveolar cell carcinoma, n = 5; sarcoidosis, n = 5; pulm onary eosinophilia, n = 3; alveolar proteinosis, n = 3; W egener's granulomatosis, n = 3; lymphoma, n = 2; infective pneumonia, n = 2). On CXR both observers made the correct confident diagnosis in 12 cases (38%). Observer 1 had included the correct diagnosis in the top three choices in 13 cases and observer 2 in 10. On CT a confident correct diagnosis was made by observer 1 in 17 cases (53%) with an inclusion in the top three in 9 cases. The respective figures for observer 2 were 15 cases (47% ) and 6 cases. Conclusion: Observer performance fo r the correct diagnosis of MC is only marginally improved with CT com pared to CXR, in contrast to the significant difference in diffuse interstitial lung disease. Kyphosis, denutrition, muscular weakness and neurological disorders limit active inspiration. Aging modifies anatom ical, histological, and physiological data of the chest: analysis of the pulmonary segments is dramatically altered.The aim o f this study w as to evaluate a passive expansion technique, by raising the arms above the head. Methods and Materials: O ver a 5-month period, 470 chest radiographs were performed in geriatric patients, fo r pulm onary acute disorders. W hen the conventional radiograph was not appropriate to assess diagnosis, another one was performed, hands up. Items were independently analyzed (5-step confidence score) by 3 radiologists, and interobserver variation rates were calculated. Results: 31 female and 2 male patients with an average age of 89 years (range 65 -1 0 1 ) were included. A com parison of the 2 types of examinations demonstrates improved efficacy of hands-up positioning. Conclusion: Optimization of the chest radiography in the geriatric patient is feasible by adapted contention. To define the role of MRI in planning treatm ent and detecting tum or response in patients with breast cancer who underwent preoperative chemotherapy. Methods and Materials: 33 patients with histologically confirmed breast car cinom a > 2.5 cm evaluated clinically, mammographically, and with US under w ent dynam ic gadolinium enhanced 1.5 T MRM (Gd-DTPA 0.2 mmol/kg body weight) performed using a double phased-array brest coil, with fast 2D or 3D SPDR sequences, before and after 3 cycles of preoperative chemotherapy. Images obtained before and after treatm ent were compared with histological reports. Results: Three patients did not undergo preoperative chemotherapy since MRM detected multicentric lesions were not identified with conventional meth ods. MRM w as more accurate than conventional techniques in lesion measure ments before treatment: in 5/30 cases, clinical investigation, mammography, and US did not allow exact measurements. After chemotherapy, dimensions reported by MRM have been confirmed by histology in 28/30 cases; mammog raphy and US did not allow a correct measurement, respectively, in 7/30, 5/30 and 5/30 cases. The com parison of MRM images before and after chem other apy demonstrated modification of the enhancement patterns suggestive of tum or necrosis. Conclusion: MRI of the breast has been demonstrated to be the first choice m ethod to select patients who are candidates fo r preoperative chemotherapy, to measure lesions before and after the treatment, and to evaluate preoperative chem otherapy response. Purpose: Therapy induced changes may be detectable earlier and more reliable by dynam ic contrast enhanced MRI compared to just morphologic as sessm ent. This study evaluates the clinical potential of MR Mammography and its pitfalls to asses and predict response during neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Material and Methods: 25 patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer w ere studied with a functional MR-Mammography technique utilizing pre and post contrast FLASH 3D images and fast dynamic series prior, after the second and fourth cycle. Quantification was done using several techniques including pharmacokinetic modeling. Histology was obtained by core-cut biopsy prior and by surgical resection after completion of chem other apy in all patients. Results: The goal of breast conserving surgery was achieved in 72% patients. No prospective factors were detectable based on the pretherapeutic study. Significant (Cl 95%) differences were found regarding the change of vascular perm eability of contrast media between the pretherapeutic and the study after the second therapy cycle in regard to the possible surgical procedure. Conclusion: MR Mammography can be used to m onitor ongoing chem other apy. Changes in vascular permeability to the contrast-media can predict the extent of response and seem s to be due to changes in neoangiogenesis and VEGF expression and detectable prior to morphologic changes.",

M ethods and Materials: 29 patients with perfusion defects in the ventilationperfusion lung scanning underwent spiral CT. The first ten patients were examined before and after intravenous injection of contrast media. The re construction of the vessels in the minimum intensity projection (MIP) and three-dimensional shaded surface display mode (BSD) without the application of contrast media is possible by using a limiting value o f -7 0 0 HU. To eliminate potentially obscuring elem ents of bone, chest wall and mediastinum, a region of interest was traced over the lung. Results: All radionuclide perfusion defects in the size of a lung segment or greater showed in spiral C T an abruptly ending vessel. Especially this was seen in the MIP reconstruction. The results were undependant of the application of contrast media. The sm aller defects often resulted in wall irregularities, stenosis o r in rarefaction of vessels. These are uncertain signs, because they are often found in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. Conclusion: Potential variability exists in the interpretation o f a lung perfusion scan. Spiral CT is useful in the diagnosis of pulm onary embolism, especially in the differential diagnosis in the peripheral zone. By a special technic of image processing there is no need of contrast media.14:20 ",

For DSC MRI 55 T 2 ' w GE images of tw o sections were acquired after bolus administration of 0.1 mmol/kg gadoteridol (Prohance\u00ae, Bracco-Byk Gulden) for the simultaneous measurement of signal-time curves in the brain feeding arteries and the brain tissue allowing the absolute quantification of rCBF and rCBV. Follow-up examinations are being performed 6 weeks and three month after radiotherapy in each patient and the measurements of rCBF and rCBV are related to a 3 point scale of treatm ent outcome. Results: DSC MRI was able to assess the hemodynamics in all patients. Changes in rCBF and rCBV of brain m etastases during therapy could already be observed and will be analysed. Conclusion: DSC MRI allows the quantitative assessm ent o f rCBV and rCBF and its changes due to therapy.

Cases associated with tuberous sclerosis, hippocampal sclerosis, and proliferative lesions (DNT and gangliocytoma) were excluded. There were 16 cases (8 females, aged 17 to 47). Clinical presentation included chronic intractable epilepsy (84% ) and headache (16%). Results: Three radiological patterns were identified: 1) Focal cortical thicken ing (4 cases); 2) Minimal change (imaging normal o r abnormal only on special sequences) (4 cases); 3) Mass lesions suggestive of neoplasia (8 cases). This group included 3 with vasogenic edem a and tw o showing progression.

In recent studies attem pts have been made to differentiate between acute uncom plicated appendicitis and acute necrotic appendicitis. Beside investigation of the appendix itself, the adjacent mesenteric tissue and the use of color Doppler imaging, careful examination of the abdominal lymphnodes is particulary helpful. Especially the paracecal lymphnode group seem s to be like a \"guidepost\" mainly in cases o f an abnorm al positioned appendix (i.e. retrocecal position). Purpose: Evaluation of abdominal lymphnodes regarding presence, size, sonographic and color Doppler pattern. Material and Methods: 56 healthy children, 33 boys and 23 girls aged 2 -18 years underwent high-resolution ultrasonography (A T I HDI 3000) o f the abdomen. A total num ber of 672 lymphnodules in the paraaortal, left and right iliaca! and paracecal region was examined. Results: The longitudinal diam eter ranged from 3.1 to 11.4 mm (m ean 6.2 mm), the transversal diam eter from 1.4 to 5.7 mm (mean 3.8 mm) without predilection fo r certain location.

M aterials and Methods: 10 \u0421\u0422\u0410 studies were performed on children. (Age: newborn-15 years, average: 6.4 years). 2 cc/kg BW of contrast material was injected, manually o r by power injector. Helical scanning was performed with 3 mm collimation, 3 -5 mm table feed and 1.5 sec exposure time. Multiplanar reformations, MIP and/or SSD renderings were obtained. Results: indications included aneurysm of vena Galeni (no = 2), aorto-iliac aneurysm (no = 2) and its postoperative control, ectopic kidney, horseshoe kidney, UPJ stenosis (no = 2), cervical mass and extensive pelvic tumor. Anatom ic detail provided by \u0421\u0422\u0410 was in all cases sufficient for establishing the correct diagnosis, angiography was not necessary in any of the cases.

Percutaneous drainage of splenic abscesses in no more dangerous than similar procedure produced in the liver.1380 Interventional radiology of the spleen J.C. Kurdziel; Luxembourg/LThe spleen can benefit all the interventional procedures performed for diag nostic or therapeutic purposes, in other major abdom inal plain organs. However, in com parison to other abdom inal organs, the spleen is particular in the following aspects:( 1) it is a highly vascularized mesenchym a with a fragile capsule, therefore, percutaneous biopsies should be performed with care, avoiding multiple passes and eventually be associated with em bolization of the intrasplenic tract used fo r biopsy.(2) because of the lack o f a strong tissular architecture, the spleen is more prone to traumatic rupture and since conservative management o f posttraumatic hematomas is mostly considered delayed percutaneous aspira tion and or drainage should be considered when spontaneous resolution is not achieved. Benign prostatic diseases as well as carcinoma of the prostate today consti tutes a major and still escalating international health problem. In a W estern society a man aged 40 will have a chance of about 2 5 -3 0 % to be operated on fo r benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH); in men more than 45 years o f age this operation become already the second most frequent one. It is easy to understand that this situation is an enormous burden on health econom ics for all countries, so the search fo r alternative m anagem ent strategies fo r BPH becomes more and more important. This includes medical m anagem ent as well as minimally invasive therapeutic options. In many developed countries prostatic carcinoma (PC) is the most com m only diagnosed m alignancy in men. Epidemiological data showed that clinically insignificant or \"latent\" cancers by fa r outnum bers the clinically significant cancer. Nevertheless there is a rising incidence of newly diagnosed PC as well as an increased mortality from PC in many developed countries where these data is available. Although this rise in new cases of PC may result, a t least in part, from an increased aw areness of and search fo r the condition by screening program s utilising PSA and modern imaging techniques, it is becoming clear that clinically significant PC is also on the increase. To select the proper form o f therapy an accurate staging of PC is mandatory. Localized PC can be cured today. In m etastastic disease life expectancy as well as the remission interval can be prolonged by modern treatm ent modalities. More accurate and earlier diagnosis, a better under standing o f the nature of this disease as well as optimal staging procedures will undoubtedly continue to expand and improve treatm ent options.

Prostate cancer is predom inantly hypoechoic but cancers may be isoechoic and this presents a diagnostic challenge for radiologists. Colour and Pow er Doppler have been relatively disappointing in identifying isoechoic prostate cancers and the role of ultrasonic contrast agents in aiding the diagnosis o f prostate cancers is currently unclear. TRUS guided biopsy is the most appropriate w ay of accu rately performing prostate biopsies; biopsies o f peripheral zone hypoechoic areas and areas of palpable abnormality may be taken; another technique is to obtain multiple systematic biopsies of the prostate under TR U S guidance in patients with abnorm al PSA levels o r abnormal PSA density.

Ability of endorectal MRI to predict local extent o f prostate cancer is controver sial.

Moreau; Paris/F Purpose: To decrease the num ber o f surgical removals by an accurate histological diagnosis of unedefined nodular o r pseudonodular breast lesions, using US-guided percutaneous automated core biopsy M aterials and Method: Within 18 months, 125 solid breast nodules or pseudonodules were biopsied with a long throw biopsy gun with a 18 gauge needle (Monopty, Bard Urological, Covington), and with a 13 MHz real time AU 530 (Esaote Biomedica, Italy) for ultrasound guidance. Results: US guided core biopsy detected 20 cancers, 55 specific benign le sions (1 phyllod tum or, 6 sclerosing adenose, 1 fibromatosis, 1 lymphadenopathy, 2 fibrous scars, 40 fibroadenom as, 2 cytosteatoscleroses), 4 cases of atypical hyperplasia and 46 non specific benign fibrocystic dystrophy. In 28 out 30 nodules surgically removed, the histological diagnoses were identical. In the 2 remaining cases, 1 fibroadenom a was assessed and a micro-cancer was found in 1 atypical hyperplasia. Conclusion: US guided biopsy is bringing a cost-effective approach of uncer tain pathological diagnoses in mastology, and should contribute to decrease the num ber o f useless surgical removal lesions provided that atypical hyper plastic lesions lesions are systematically removed. mas in situ (CIS)) and 55 benign lesions (25.5% o f total biopsied lesions) in 116 patients. CB was performed with an automated device and tru-cut modified 16 G needle. For lesions echographic (US) visible (63%) US guidance was used (for a better training). Mammographie (MX) guidance was reserved to lesions appreciable on mammography. US and/or MX suspicious were evalu ated qualitatively by subjective assessment (two operators) with three degrees of severity and were com pared to pathological findings. Results: with a US and MX low, m oderate and severe suspicious 7 carcinomas (M) and 29 benign lesions (B), 12 M and 20 B, 42 M and 6 \u0412 respectively emerged. CB correctly identified 6/7 M (86%), 9/12 M (75%) and 40/42 M (95.2%). Positive predictive value was 100%; in all carcinomas, hormonal receptors study, was performed. Surgical findings confirmed 5 CIS. Conclusions: CB reduced num ber of surgical biopsies, expecially for le sions with low US and MX suspicious. In ou r experience with C B positivity, intrasurgical histologic analysis was superflous. To assess the accuracy with which stereotaxic core biopsy of breast microcalcifications help to adapt the surgical decision or to justify follow-up. Materials and Methods: Eithy nine patients underwent stereotaxic breast biopsy performed with large core, 14 gauge needles. Histopathologic findings of microbiopsies were correlated with radiological findings, with follow up and with surgical results. Results: Agreement between radiological and histopathologic findings on biopsies was obtained in 86% fo r benign results. A surgical biopsy was necessary and justified in 11%. Radiological suspicious or malignant microcal cifications were correlated with 35% benign and 65% malignant histologies on biopsies. The positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy were respectively 93%, 86% and 95%, when we correlated pathologic results of microbiopsies and pathologic findings at surgery o r follow up. Invasive lesions were found on microbiopsies in 39% of excised malignant lesions. Multifocal lesions were proved on microbiopsies before surgical excision in 50% of all carcinomas. Conclusion: Microbiopsies help to disclose malignant lesions missed on radiological analysis, and to accure the first surgical treatment: axillary lymph node dissection in the invasive lesions and mastectomy in the mutifocal lesions. Methods and Materials: Non-palpable mammographie abnorm alities were categorised according to sign: circumscribed mass, spiculate mass, mi crocalcification -low suspicion, microcalcification -high suspicion, stel late/parenchymal deformity, asym metrical density. 14 G CB (minimum 5 passes) was performed using a Kimal automated biopsy device and a dedi cated prone stereotactic biopsy system (Fischer Mammotest). Sensitivity and specificity were measured by com paring CB result with outcome. Results: CB w as performed on non-palpable suspicious mammographie ab normalities on 300 cases. The final outcom e w as 150 cases (50%) -malignant (97 invasive cancer); 110 cases (37%) -no surgery; 40 cases (13.3%) had benign surgical excision biopsies. The com plete sensitivity (malignant o r sus picious CB) for cancer detection by CB = 98% (range 100% -95%). The absolute sensitivity (m alignant CB only) = 88% (range = 98.4% -68%). There were no false positive results. Specificity = 100%. Conclusion: 14 G CB using prone stereotactic guidance is an accurate method of obtaining a histological diagnosis for most suspicious non-palpable mammographie lesions.",

Materials and Methods: 1,500 percutaneous core biopsies performed be tween 1992 and 1995 on 1,500 consecutive asym ptom atic screening patients whose mammograms revealed slightly problematic variations, beneath our threshold fo r recommending surgical consultation yet not within our param eters fo r \"normality.\" W hen an abnorm ality was neither clinically palpable nor sonographically visible, thereby obviating the possibility of FNAC, we performed core biopsy. The value of ultrasound regarding the preoperative localization of impalpable breast leasions were investigated into. Methods and Materials: 89 non-palpable lesions in 76 patients were preoperatively localized and marked with the aid of ultrasound. Examination was perform ed in the position the patients would occupy at surgery, and, follow ing identification by ultrasound the skin overlying the impalpable lesion was marked with an alcohol-and water-insoluble pen. The depth of the lesion below the skin and it's diam eter was established. Results: All 89 lesions were com pletely removed. In 92.1% (82/89) of cases, the lesions were intraoperatively found immediately and complete excision with a margin of safety of 1 cm to 2 cm w as obtained. In 7.9% (7/89) of cases, intraoperative rapid section revealed an invasive growth at resection margins, thus single further resection was necessary.

Axial T2w CEFFE and coronal, sagittal and radial T2w TSE were performed. Sphincter morphology, defects and atrophy were scored. The decision to perform surgery was based on physical examination and endoanal ultrasound exclusively. All patients underwent anterior anal sphincter repair within six months of the MRI. Clinical outcom e was evaluated using the grade and frequency of incontinence, the grade o f social isolation and patient satisfaction after a median follow up of one year. Results: Patients with atrophy (3/8: 38%) had markedly worse results than patients without atrophy (6/7: 86%). Similarly, in patients with a sphincterdefect and atrophy results were inferior (2/5: 40%) as com pared to patients with a sphincterdefect only (4/5: 80%). Conclusion: This pilotstudy demonstrates that atrophy (only visible with en doanal MRI) rather than sphincterdefects predicts surgical outcome. Therefore, endoanal MRI might be valuable in the preoperative assessm ent of the faecal incontinent patient.

A solution was addition of STIR images and corresponding T2W images. In 6 patients internal openings of fistulae not detectable by rectoscopy or palpation could be identified using MRI. In 3 patients fistulae proved to be much more com plex than clinically suspected. Conclusion: Low field MR-lm aging using conventional Helmholtz body coils significantly facilitates delineation and classification of perianal fistulae and abscesses and is therefore strongly recommended prior to surgical treat ment.",

Their myocardial perfusion differ significantly between 100 \u00b1 8 and 69 \u00b1 20 (m l/100 gr/min) Conclusion: In patients with normal LVMM/EDV and without significant coro nary stenosis myocardial perfusion decreases with increasing coronary cal cium score. In hypertrophic patients, myocardial perfusion is increasing with decreasing LVMM/EDV although the percentage of significant coronary artery stenosis is increasing. Method: Seven patients were treated by this method. All procedures were performed by transfem oral route. Home-made coils, designed during the pro cedure, were used to block the shunt. W e electively occluded distal segment of the shunt by an inflated flow-guided catheter prior to the delivery of the coil in five patients in order to reduce the blood flow at the site of occlusion. Result: Occlusion w as com plete in six and failed in one patient. Inadvertent embolization o f the coil to the pulm onary artery occurred in this patient. This coil was removed at subsequent surgery. In another patient, one of the coils embolized to the right renal artery, from which it was removed at surgery. In both these patients, the flow-guided catheter was not used to reduce blood flow in the shunt. No complication was encountered in all five patients in whom the above-mentioned catheter was used. No flow through the shunt was seen at subsequent elective surgery in all six patients with com plete occlusion. In systemic am yloidosis MRI may detect amyloid protein by tissue characterization. Aim of the study was to detect typical features of cardiac am yloidosis (CA) and to evaluate a possible contribution in the differential diagnosis with symmetrical hypertrophic cardiomiopathy (HCM).Sixteen patients with C A and 10 patients with HCM underwent MRI exam ination. Myocardial ventricular and atrial thickness, right and left ventricular diastolic diam eter and atrial surface were compared. Ventricular myocardium signal intensity w as evaluated in T1 and 1 2 sequences and com pared to the signal intensity of a skeletal muscle as expression of myocardial texture modification. Significant differences between CA and HCM were found in right atrium surface (respectively 21.9 cm2 vs 17 cm2; p < 0.005), right atrium myocardial thickness (9.3 mm vs 4.9 mm; p = 0.0001) and interatrial septum (8.7 vs 5.3 mm; p = 0.001). The signal intensity of CA was significantly lower both in T1 and T2 sequences in comparison to HCM and to a referring group. MRI has a potential role in the non-invasive diagnosis of CA identifying typical morphological markers and presence of infiltrative disease by tissue characterization. The thickness o f wall of LV respectively was 9.1 \u00b1 1.8 mm in DCM, and 11.0 \u00b1 0.8 mm in Al, both w ere in normal range. 3. The systolic wall thickening percentage of LV was 20.8 \u00b1 3.5% in DCM, and 35.3 \u00b1 5.4% in Al. The form er was significantly reduced, and the Latter w as in normal range. The difference between the two groups had statistical significance (P < 0.001 ). to analyze cardiac iron deposition and dysfunction in patients with \u0414-thalassem ia major by MR imaging. Methods and Materials: 16 patients, submitted to high dose transfusional regimen and iron chelation therapy underwent MR imaging examination. All the exam s were performed on a 0.5 T superconducting unit. ECG gated SE and Cine-GE pulse sequences in the four chamber, tw o cham ber and short axis planes were used. Myocardial signal alterations were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively and com pared with normal volunteers. Left ventricular function param eters such as end-diastolic volume, stroke volume and ejection fraction were assessed by using the biplane area-length method. Regional myocardial function was evaluated too. All the patients underwent echocardiography. Results: on ECG gated C ine GE the myocardial signal intensity in patients with \u0414-thalassem ia m ajor was either qualitatively and quantitatively low er than in normal volunteers because of cardiac iron deposition. Decrease o f the global left ventricular function and alterations of the regional function were observed too. MRI findings were well correlated with echocardiography.

Method: 24 patients w ere studied using a multi slice flow mode after adm in istration o f 50 ml o f contrast medium intravenously with a flow of 3 ml/s. 6 tom ographic levels (each 7 mm thick) were imaged 13 tim es at 80% of the R-R interval at each second, third o r fourth heart beat ECG gated. Image acquisition was started 2 -3 seconds before the estimated start of contrast enhancem ent in the aortic root as determ ined in a preceding transit time sequence. Perfusion estim ates were calculated fo r each patient using two different methods. M ethod 1 is deduced from the Pick principle. Perfusion is defined as a difference of peak and precontrast CT value in the left ventricular myocardium divided by the blood pool curve after correction fo r recirculation. Method 2 is based on a nuclear medicine method and defined as maximum slope of myocardial time density curve divided by the difference of peak and precontrast CT value o f blood pool curve. Results: Using the Pick principle, the mean myocardial perfusion was calcu lated as 53.2 ml/100 g/min (sd 11.2 range 38 -8 5 ). Using method 2, the mean value fo r perfusion was 68. Purpose: As a way for the objective assessm ent of the wallthickness of small bronchi in C T does not exist, it has been the aim of the following study to check a new method, which had seemed appropriate in a clinical trial formerly, the validity and feasibility of which has never been proved however. Material and Methods: High resolution CT w as done of a pig lung, which had been fixed with a mixture o f polyethylenglycole and formalin and dried afterwards. Scan param eters included 255 mAs, 137 kV, 1 mm slice thickness, a FoV of 8.3 cm and an ultra high resolution algorithm. The lung was dissected according to scan slices and whole lung specim ens were prepared for histology. 30 bronchi, their wall of which could be visualized to be circular, were chosen from the CT data and the corresponding histologic specimens were selected. For histologic assessment of the bronchial wall thickness we used a com puted picture analysis system (S um m a-S ketch*). For CT-analysis the CT data were transferred to a working station and density measurements of each pixel which accounted for the bronchial wall and its surrounding lung parenchyma within a defined radius w ere done. The data were expressed as means and standard deviation and regression analysis was performed.Results: There was a strong correlation (r = 0.94) between the density measurements (HE) and bronchial wall thickness as assessed by histologic measurements. Conclusion: This is the first tim e an objective method fo r the assessment of the w allthickness o f small bronchi is presented. Density measurement of the bronchial wall and Its surrounding parenchym a is an indirect but reliable way fo r determ ination o f bronchial wallthickness. right DLPA led to an incomplete pulm onary arterial occlusion. Eight to 12 weeks later, post-mortem bronchial angiograms and pathological studies were systematically performed in Group 2. Results: In Group 1, (a) a common trunk to the right and left bronchial arteries was found in 5 animals; (b) and broncho-pulmonary anastomoses were found in the 5 lungs optimally injected. In Group 2, (a) the absence of pulmonary infarct and the developm ent of a collateral bronchial supply were constant findings in the left lung; (b) the left DLPA were patent beyond the coils and opacified via broncho-pulm onary anastom oses; (c) dilated subpleural bronchial arteries were constant findings in the interlobular septa of the lung parenchyma devoid of pulm onary arterial perfusion; (d) the right bronchial arteries were normal after incom plete pulm onary artery occlusion.

In every patients axial sections o f the chest were scanned through the deepest part of the deformity. The largest ratio of the transverse to the anteroposterior diam eter was calculated (pectus index). A com parative study of the pre-and postoperative index allowed us to evaluate the morphological changes. Normal index w as considered m inor than 3.25. Results: Pectus index was major than 3.25 in all patients, ranged 3.81 to 26.13 (mean 6.68).

Gleeson; Oxford/UK Purpose: To determ ine the accuracy o f ultrasound in detecting pneum otho races. Methods and Materials: 30 patients referred fo r a com puted tom ogram (CT) guided 22 gauge fine needle aspiration (FNA) of a central pulm onary mass are to be identified. C T sections through the mass are perform ed to identify the biopsy site and to exclude a pre-existing pneumothorax. The site is exam ined before and immediately after the biopsy using a 7 MHz linear array probe. The sonographic findings are clearly documented before a post biopsy C T section is performed and the findings compared. Results: To date 10 biopsies in 8 patients have been performed. 3 pneu mothoraces were identified at the biopsy site on C T of which 3 were detected by ultrasound. 1 patient developed a pneum othorax medial to the biopsy site, confirmed only on CT and not identified on ultrasound. The remaining 6 cases had no evidence of pneumothorax on either im aging modality, giving a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 100%.",

This has im portant implications particularly in emergency situations, following ultrasound guided interventional techniques and on intensive therapy units. Results: Interstitial pulm onary edem a w as determ ined in 37 patients. Histo graphic analysis has showed that edem a in supine positioned patients was markedly prominent in the posterior (lower) areas corresponding the lower lobe especially in the basal segments, the histogram s being conical and widened vs. that o f healthy persons. The anterior (superior) regions corresponding to the upper lobe were noted to be com pensatory bulging. In 13 patients with fa r pronounced interstitial lung edem a the histogram base shortening and the displacem ent to more densed side were detected in basal segments. To our mind these changes were attributed to the onset of alveolar edema. Conclusion: C om puted tom ography with lung density histographic analysis enables to evaluate lung edema prevalence and to diagnose its conversion into the alveolar stage. Purpose: To evaluate the role of neurovascular conflict at the level of left C1 epinephrine brain-stem nucleus and Xth cranial nerve using fast low-angle shot MR angiography. Material and Methods: 32 patients with essential hypertension, previously evaluated by electocardiographic, echocardiographic and urinary proteins re ports, were examined. Patients older than 65 were excluded. The control group consisted of 60 healthy volunteers. Patients underwent a three-dimensional fast low-angle shot imaging, centered at the level o f the IXth and the Xth cranial nerve entry-zone and ponto-medullary junction. One patient with tic convulsif underwent surgery fo r vascular decompression, with hypertension resolution. Neurovascular conflict was termed as \"contact\" (grade I), \"com pression\" (grade II) and \"distortion\" (grade III). Left-sided versus right sided neurovascular conflict was considered also. Results: 77% of patients affected by essential hypertension had left-sided ventrolateral medulla conflict (17% bilateral) related to vertebral or basilar artery and PICA. Only 5% were positive fo r neurovascular contact in the control group. The IXth and the Xth cranial nerves were detected in 54% of patients.Conclusion: According to recent pathophysiologic studies, fast-low-angle shot MR angiography seem s to prove the role o f neurovascular conflict in ventro lateral medulla com pression of C1 nucleus and vagus nerve deafferentiation, generating essential hypertension.",

W e wanted to assess the role of CT angiography (\u0421\u0422\u0410) in the diagnostic evaluation o f suspected acute BA occlusion. Materials and Methods: Ten patients with clinically suspected BA occlusion were examined with conventional C T and spiral CT angiography. 130 ml of nonionic contrast media were injected. In four patients transfem oral digital subtraction angiography (DBA) was additionally performed. All but one patient had a follow -up CT examination the next day. Results: \u0421\u0422\u0410 demonstrated BA occlusion in 6 patients and a partially throm bosed megadolichobasilar artery in one patient. In 4 o f the 6 patients with CT-angiographically diagnosed BA occlusion an additional DBA was per formed which confirmed the \u0421\u0422\u0410 findings.

Scans were recorded a t regular time intervals. All scans were inde pendently assessed by tw o radiologists, and the am ount of visible arteriolar vessels was graded from I to III (I rich, II reduced, III poor). Results: Helicine arteries arising at regular intervals from the cavernosal arteries as small groups of vessels were visualized in all subjects, with a score of grade I in 15 patients (12 nondiabetic, 3 diabetic) grade II in 10 patients (3 nondiabetic, 7 diabetic) and grade III in 10 patients (all diabetic). Shunt vessels, straight vessels that reach the level of the albuginea, were seen in all patients with the same grade of conspiquity (grade I (6), arteriography (7) and color Doppler (2). Five reported previous traum a unrelated to sexual activity. Em bolization was attempted in 5 and performed in 4 patients. Fibered coils or polyvinylalcohol particles were used as em bolising agent. Results: Cavernosography showed the characteristic \"flush away\" sign in all 6 patients and correctly identified the side of the lesion. Cavernosography allowed simultaneous m easurement of the elevated intracorporal pressure. Leak and low resistance flow pattern was found at color Doppler examination. Arteriography was diagnostic in all cases. Manual com pression o f the penis prior to contrast medium injection is recommended.

It is based on orientation selection and aniscotropic smoothing, applied to the data volum e before the maximum intensity projection. The filter was tested as dynam ic contrast enhanced subtraction MRA images of the low er limb of fourteen random ly selected patients. For each patient two sets of 19 identical coronal sections were acquired using a fast gradient echo sequence, without contrast medium and after an intra venous bolus injection of gadoterate meglumine. The filter has been evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively. Results: The background in the filtered images is visually smoother, the vessels appear more continuous. The qualitative remarks are corroborated by the quantitative measures. The entropy is reduced while the signal to noise ratio and the contrast are improved. Methods and Materials: MR imaging was performed on a 1.5 T wholebody scanner (Siemens, Erlangen) using a motion com pensated 3D-FISP sequence. A frameless fiducial m arker system is used for stereotactic regis tration. Using an infrared (IR) tracking system the direction of the ultrasound is correlated to the MRA data during TCD. The investigator performing the TCD is provided on a com puter monitor with vessel projections calculated from the MRA data. Points where the TCD ultrasound beam hits a vessel are displayed in real-time together with information's about the angle of insonation and vessel diameter. Results: Using phantom studies and volunteers it could be shown that a high degree of accuracy and reproducibility in localizing specific vessel sections is achieved with the presented system. Conclusions: MRA data, which are acquired fo r most neurologic intensive care patients, are used to provide the physician performing the TCD with the topology of the intracranial vessel structure. This facilitates a reproducible localization o f specific vessels segments which is in particular im portant for repeated monitoring of cerebal blood flow over an extended period o f time.",

There were only 3 corresponding signal differences in the enhanced spin echo images. Methods and Materials: MRA of the liver was performed in 46 consented patients before and following intravenous bolus injection of Resovist (25.7 mg Fe < 60 kg bodyweight and 39.9 mg Fe > 60 kg bodyweight). Patients were scanned with breathheld axial and coronal 2D -TO F (TR 31.0 ms, \u0422\u0415 9.8 ms, 144 x 256 matrix, and 6.9 s per 4/1 mm section). Visibility of portalvenous vessels was assessed by counting branches of the portalvenous system separately on pre and postcontrast images. Signal intensity values of liver parenchyma, the portalvenous system, and background was obtained for quantitative analysis. Results: Liver S/N significantly decreased while S/N of the portal vein or hepatic veins did not significantly change. Subsequently, liver-vessel contrast significantly increased which improved the visibility of the portalvenous system significantly ( focal liver disease; doses tested: 0.005 to 0.2 mmol/kg; T1W SE and T1WGE sequences performed pre-dose and 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, and 120 minutes post-dose; liver-parenchym a SI derived from the MR images by standard region-of-interest method; post-dose percent SI enhancement calculated, and its time course analysed. Results: Kinetics: t l/2 distribution phase: 0.085-0.605 h; t i /2 elimination phase: 1.17-2.02 h; apparent total volum e of distribution: 0.170-0.282 L k g~1; total clearance: 0 .0 9 3 -0 .1 3 3 L h -1 -kg-1 .

T1w SE (300/12) and GRE (80/2.3/80 ) images at 1.5 T (Signa, GE) were used. Dosage (Gd-BOPTA 0.1 mmol/kg, n = 17; o r Gd-BOPTA 0.05 mmol/kg, n = 17; o r Mn-DPDP 5 /\u00bfmol/kg, n = 17) was based on manufacturers' recom m endations. Quantitative analysis (liver SNR and lesion-liver CNR) was done.Results: SNR was highest with 0.1 mmol/kg Gd-BOPTA on GRE images (51.3 \u00b1 3.6) (p < 0.05). CNR w as highest after Mn-DPDP on GRE images (-2 2 .6 \u00b1 2.7) but this was not statistically different from others (p = 0.07). Overall GRE images were superior to SE images fo r SNR and CNR. In the post-stenting weeks a control angiography was performed, whereafter the animals were sacrificed fo r specimen exploration. The first 3 animals only received aspirin. The following anim als received aspirin orally and calparin subcutaneously. Results: In the 11 surgically successful induced cavai stenoses, 10 stents w ere successfully placed and patent at control cavography. At evaluation of the vena cava specimen in 2 o f the first 3 pigs a large throm bus mass was seen. Therefore the throm bolytic therapy w as extended with calparin fo r the following animals. By specimen evaluation o f these anim als only a very small throm bus w as found in 3. Extensive neo-endothelialization and no thrombus formation was seen when the stent was firm ly impacted against the vessel wall. One procedure failed due to stent migration. Conclusion: In this animal study deploym ent of the extra large Palmaz stent in surgically induced high pressure stenoses w as successful in 10 out of 11 procedures. In venous stenting adequate throm bolytic therapy is essential to minimize stent thrombosis.S 294 10:451493 Interim results in a clinical study using the Amplatz device in the treatment of acute lower limb ischem ia after a follow-up period of 10 months N. Rilinger, J. G\u00f6rich, R. Scharrer-Pamler, R. Sokiranski, R. Tomczak, H.-J. Brambs; Ulm/D Purpose: To elucidate the therapeutical effect o f the Amplatz-Thrombectomy-Device (ATD) in the treatm ent of acute thromboembolic occlusions. Materials and Methods: 60 patients with acute occlusions of the low er limb arteries (3 h -8 days, mean 2 days) were treated with the ATD. An embolic event as reason for lower limb occlusion was observed in 42 patients. 18 pa tients suffered from acute throm botic occlusion on the base of atherosclerotic disease. Average clinical or colour coded ultrasound follow-up was 10 months. Results: C omplete success without adjunctive procedure w as achieved in 60% of the patients. Mean throm bectom y tim e in those cases was 75 sec. Partial Success with need o f additional procedures like local thrombolysis or PTA was achieved in 35% of the patients. Doppler-lndex increased significantly (p < 0.001) from 0.45 before intervention to 0.96 after intervention. There were 3 failures (5%) due to bad peripheral outflow in patients with advanced atherosclerotic disease. No major com plications occurred. Patency (\u0424 followup 10 months) w as 85%.Conclusions: High speed thrombectom y using the ATD is a very effective and save procedure for quick restoration o f vascular patency. In 55 cases, Urokinase was first infused fo r 2 hours at a dose o f 100,000 units/hr through 2 crossing needles. Remaining clots were then aspirated through 8 F wide lumen catheters (\" Brite Tip\", Cordis*). In 69 cases, aspiration was performed directly without previous Urokinase. All patients received 3,000 units o f heparin and antibiotics. Results: All PTFE grafts were successfully declotted. The 3 immediate failures with BCF were linked to tortuous and fragile veins. Complications included 4 arterial emboli, effectively treated by thrombolysis o r aspiration, 1 massive bleeding at a puncture site at 6 days, 2 false-aneurysm s at 15 days and 1 month. A stent was placed in 21/52 (40%) PTFE grafts at a mean follow-up of 5.8 months and in 3/34 (9%) BCF. Including initial failures, prim ary patency rates for BCF were 79 \u00b1 7% at 1 month, 57 \u00b1 9% at 6 months, 52 \u00b1 12% at 1 year. For grafts these rates were 88 \u00b1 5% at 1 month, 36 \u00b1 7% at 6 months, 15 \u00b1 9% at 1 year. W ith percutaneous reinterventions (redilations, stent placements, new declottings), secondary patency rates fo r BCF were 69 \u00b1 9% at 1 year. For grafts, rates were 86 \u00b1 8% at 1 year and 75 \u00b1 12% at 2 years. A mean of one reintervention w as necessary every 18.1 months for BCF and every 5.9 months (3 tim es as often) for grafts. Conclusion: Thrombo-aspiration, with or without prior Urokinase infusion, allows the best primary patency rates published one m onth after declotting of PTFE grafts. With appropriate percutaneous reinterventions, including stent placement in 40% of cases, secondary patency rates o f grafts and native veins are also clearly superior to the data o f literature. M ethod and Patients: From 07.93 to 08.96, 87 visceral digital substraction angiograms, performed fo r gastrointestinal bleeding, uncovered bleeding sites in 55 cases, demonstrating contrast-extravasation (n = 16) o r structural abnor malities (n = 39: portal venous pathology n = 10, visceral pseudoaneurysm n = 5, AV-malformation n = 8, Meckel's diverticulum n = 2, other n = 14). Emboliza tion was technically possible in 13 of 16 cases with contrast-extravasation and in 11 cases of the other group. Occluded lesions were located in the stomach (n = 5) and duodenum (n = 6), the liver (n = 4), small bowel (n = 4) and colon (n = 5). Embolization was performed with a diagnostic 5 French catheter (n = 5) o r coaxially with a 3 F microcatheter (n = 19) using gelatine, polyvinyl alcohol particles, stainless steel coils, platinum microcoils and n-butyl cyanoacrylate as embolic agents. Results: 30 days survival was 79% (19/24). 5 patients died from multiorgan failure; 3 of them underwent laparotomy for suspected rebleeding. Emboliza tion failed only in one case, forcing a successful emergency laparatomy. In the long term, tw o recurrences were treated by surgery (jejunal AVM, ischemic colonic ulcer). There were no ischaemic complications. Conclusions: Embolization of gastrointestinal haem orrhage is effective and safe.",

Hauss; Tours/F Purpose: to assess the long-term value o f percutaneous treatm ent of dialysis fistula dysfunction. Methods and Materials: Between January 1987 and July 1996, 144 consec utive native fistulas fo r hemodialysis were dilated in 135 patients (48 women, 87 men, age: 2 2 -9 6 , mean: 61). Fistulas were radio-cephalic or radio-basilic (103), brachio-cephalic (26), brachio-basilic (13) and at the thigh (1 ). The initial symptoms were low flow (38%), increased venous pressure (33%), thrombosis (18%) and difficulties in cannulation (11%). Clinical and para-clinical nephro logical surveillance led to 147 redilations, 27 stent placem ents (13 W allstents, 14 Craggstents) and to 12 percutaneous declottings by thromboaspiration. Results: Including initial failures (5/127), primary, assisted prim ary and sec ondary patency rates were 42 \u00b1 5%, 77 \u00b1 6%, 79 \u00b1 4% at 1 year and 33 \u00b1 8%, 77 \u00b1 8%, 75 \u00b1 7% at 3 years. A mean of one redilatation every 14 months was necessary to achieve patency. Results were less favourable for the brachio-cephalic sub-group with frequent initial ruptures and with a mean S 295 Friday reintervention interval of 7.2 m onths (twice as often). After stent placement for early restenosis, the mean free function interval increased from 3.6 to 6.6 months (x 1.8).Conclusion: Percutaneous treatm ent of Brescia-Cimino fistula stenoses achieves high long-term secondary patency rates, but with more frequent redilations fo r the brachio-cephalic sub-group.",

Kawata; Osaka/J Purpose: To develop an effective intervention of neoplastic lesions using a newly devised em bolic material without antineoplastic agents. Materials and Methods: Super absorbent polymer microsphere (SAP-MS, sodium acrylate and vinyl alcohol copolymer) was used as the embolic mate rial. It passes through a m icrocatheter and increases in size within minutes, when it contacts with serum. The size of microsphere is exactly calibrated us ing sieves in 50 micrometer steps. No toxicity was revealed in animal studies. Seven patients with benign lesions (5-kidney, 2-miscellaneous) and 12 patients with malignant lesions (4-kidney, 3-bone metastases, 2-liver, 3-miscellaneous), including 7 patients with preoperative state, were treated transarterially using various sizes o f SAP-MS without anti-neoplastic agents. In 4 patients, resected specim ens were evaluated histopathologically. To reevaluate cardiac MR imaging with regard to the phased array coil and newer pulse sequences in com parison to fast helical CT Methods and Material: Various fast and ultrafast MR-imaging strategies have been tested in 19 patients with inflammatory (n = 4), neoplastic (n = 12) and congenital (n = 3) pathology of the heart. The diagnostic outcom e of MRI was com pared with informations obtainable by fast helical-CT performed with 0.75 sec./revolution, 5 mm collimation, pitch 1 and 180\u00b0 interpolation algorithm. Results: T2-weighted and STIR-contrast images with suppression o f blood signal are most suitable for cardiac screening. Gadolinium uptake fo r further mass characterization o r therapy-monitoring can be assessed with a multi-slice 300 m s SR (saturation recovery) turboFLASH sequence. To further delineate the mass location, contractility of myocardium and shunting breath-held movie loops obtained with segmented turboFLASH sequences are mandatory. Conclusion: Ultrafast MRI affords a detailed morphological and functional analysis o f the heart. W ithin 30 minutes of examination time several m ajor fac tors in the evaluation of pathology can be assessed: morphology, tissue water content and gadolinium perfusion/uptake of masses, myocardial contractility and flow dynam ics in the vessels as well as shunt directions and volum es through septal defects. Except for the pathognom ic depiction of calcifications and for the capability o f multiplanar reconstruction, cardiac MRI is superior to fast helical C T in the trade off between spatial, temporal and contrast resolution.",
