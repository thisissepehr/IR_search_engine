Of these substances, which include the interleukins, interferons and tumour necrosis factors (TNFs), interleukin-l (IL-l) has been considered potentially a most important inflammatory mediator because of its wide range of effects (reviewed in refs I, 2).

            "text": "Two human TNFs have been isolated: TNFa (refs 8, 9) is a product of activated mononuclear phagocytes, TNFf3 (ref. 7) of activated lymphocytes. The proteins show about 50% homology in nucleotide sequence and compete for a common class of receptors on the cervical carcinoma line . TNFa is probably identical with cachectin ll , a factor that suppresses production of lipoprotein lipase in cultured adipocytes, and may playa part in the development of cachexia during infection l2 . IL-I shows some biological similarity to TNF: it is cytotoxic to certain transfonned cells l3 and it suppresses production oflipoprotein lipase in adipocytes l4 . Furthermore, cachectin has recently been shown to stimulate production of prostaglandins and latent collagenase by human synovial and dennal fibroblasts in a manner similar to IL-lls. In view of these findings, I have investigated the effect of TNFa on both the resorption and synthesis of proteoglycan by explants of cartilage, Chondroitin-sulphate-rich proteoglycan is an essential component of the matrix of cartilage since it enables the tissue to resist compression during load-bearing. Loss of proteoglycan, such as occurs in rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and other joint diseases, results in severe impairment of the function of cartilage. IL-l is the only purified cytokine known to cause cartilage to degrade its proteoglycan 4 ,16, and to inhibit resynthesis 17 \u2022 Figure la shows the amount of proteoglycan (measured as percentage of total chondroitin sulphate) released from porcine articular cartilage during 6 days of culture in the presence of human recombinant TNFa or pure porcine IL-l. The TNFa caused up to 75% of the proteoglycan to be released, although it was less potent than the IL-l, which was significantly active at a 20-fold lower dose (0.5 pM). Figure 1 b shows a similar experiment carried out on cartilage from bovine nasal septum which was cultured for a shorter period (48 h): again, the IL-l was more potent. The time dependence of the release of proteoglycan from bovine cartilage caused by sub-maximal concentrations of the two agents revealed that their effects were additive. Figure Ie shows that 50 pM IL-l or 290 pM TNFa caused a similar rate of release, and that this was approximately doubled when the agents were combined. Maximal stimulation of cartilage by IL-I caused more rapid release of proteoglycan than did TNFa (Fig.ld) : results for two concentrations of each cytokine demonstrate that responses were maximal. Supramaximal doses of the two agents in combination caused a rate of release that was considerably faster than that due to TNFa alone, but was not significantly greater than that seen with lL-1 alone. The failure of TNFa to augment the maximal response to IL-I may be because the limit of the chondrocytes' ability to degrade their matrix in vitro was being approached.",

            "text": "The enzymatic mechanism by which the proteoglycan is degraded in cartilage is not understood. Normally, cartilage proteoglycans aggregate in a specific manner with hyaluronic acid, and it is thought that the large size of these aggregates causes them to be trapped in the matrix. Cartilage stimulated by IL-I releases fragments of proteoglycan which, as judged by gel filtration, are smaller than nonnal proteoglycan monomers and are unable to aggregate with hyaluronic acid ls . There is no evidence of degradation of their chondroitin sulphate chains. These changes suggest that degradation is by limited proteolysis of the protein core. The fragments of proteoglycan that were released by cartilage stimulated with TNF behaved similarly on gel filtration to those generated by stimulation with IL-I (Fig. 2) . The bulk of the fragments generated by stimulation with either agent emerged from a Sepharose 2B column at a region between the elution positions of intact proteoglycan and proteoglycan digested with papain (which consists largely of single-chain chondroitin sulphate peptides). Addition of hyaluronic acid to the prot eo glycan fragments before chromatography caused little or no fonnation of aggregates. This suggested that the hyaluronate binding region was blocked or had been lost. When the proteolgycan fragments were chromatographed under dissociative conditions (4 M guanidine-HCl in the chromatographic buffer) the position of the main peak was unchanged. These experiments showed that chondrocytes activated by TNF or IL-I caused a similar limited proteolysis of the proteoglycans.",

Its action is similar to and additive with IL-l, and it is a second macropbage-derived cytokine wbose production ' in rheumatoid artbritis, or inflammation generally, could contribute to tissue destruction.",

            "text": "Two human TNFs have been isolated: TNFa (refs 8, 9) is a product of activated mononuclear phagocytes, TNFf3 (ref. 7) of activated lymphocytes. The proteins show about 50% homology in nucleotide sequence and compete for a common class of receptors on the cervical carcinoma line ME-180 (ref. 10) . TNFa is probably identical with cachectin ll , a factor that suppresses production of lipoprotein lipase in cultured adipocytes, and may playa part in the development of cachexia during infection l2 . IL-I shows some biological similarity to TNF: it is cytotoxic to certain transfonned cells l3 and it suppresses production oflipoprotein lipase in adipocytes l4 . Furthermore, cachectin has recently been shown to stimulate production of prostaglandins and latent collagenase by human synovial and dennal fibroblasts in a manner similar to IL-lls. In view of these findings, I have investigated the effect of TNFa on both the resorption and synthesis of proteoglycan by explants of cartilage, Chondroitin-sulphate-rich proteoglycan is an essential component of the matrix of cartilage since it enables the tissue to resist compression during load-bearing. Loss of proteoglycan, such as occurs in rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and other joint diseases, results in severe impairment of the function of cartilage. IL-l is the only purified cytokine known to cause cartilage to degrade its proteoglycan 4 ,16, and to inhibit resynthesis 17 \u2022 Figure la shows the amount of proteoglycan (measured as percentage of total chondroitin sulphate) released from porcine articular cartilage during 6 days of culture in the presence of human recombinant TNFa or pure porcine IL-l. The TNFa caused up to 75% of the proteoglycan to be released, although it was less potent than the IL-l, which was significantly active at a 20-fold lower dose (0.5 pM). Figure 1 b shows a similar experiment carried out on cartilage from bovine nasal septum which was cultured for a shorter period (48 h): again, the IL-l was more potent. The time dependence of the release of proteoglycan from bovine cartilage caused by sub-maximal concentrations of the two agents revealed that their effects were additive. Figure Ie shows that 50 pM IL-l or 290 pM TNFa caused a similar rate of release, and that this was approximately doubled when the agents were combined. Maximal stimulation of cartilage by IL-I caused more rapid release of proteoglycan than did TNFa (Fig.ld) : results for two concentrations of each cytokine demonstrate that responses were maximal. Supramaximal doses of the two agents in combination caused a rate of release that was considerably faster than that due to TNFa alone, but was not significantly greater than that seen with lL-1 alone. The failure of TNFa to augment the maximal response to IL-I may be because the limit of the chondrocytes' ability to degrade their matrix in vitro was being approached.",

            "text": "The enzymatic mechanism by which the proteoglycan is degraded in cartilage is not understood. Normally, cartilage proteoglycans aggregate in a specific manner with hyaluronic acid, and it is thought that the large size of these aggregates causes them to be trapped in the matrix. Cartilage stimulated by IL-I releases fragments of proteoglycan which, as judged by gel filtration, are smaller than nonnal proteoglycan monomers and are unable to aggregate with hyaluronic acid ls . There is no evidence of degradation of their chondroitin sulphate chains. These changes suggest that degradation is by limited proteolysis of the protein core. The fragments of proteoglycan that were released by cartilage stimulated with TNF behaved similarly on gel filtration to those generated by stimulation with IL-I (Fig. 2) . The bulk of the fragments generated by stimulation with either agent emerged from a Sepharose 2B column at a region between the elution positions of intact proteoglycan and proteoglycan digested with papain (which consists largely of single-chain chondroitin sulphate peptides). Addition of hyaluronic acid to the prot eo glycan fragments before chromatography caused little or no fonnation of aggregates. This suggested that the hyaluronate binding region was blocked or had been lost. When the proteolgycan fragments were chromatographed under dissociative conditions (4 M guanidine-HCl in the chromatographic buffer) the position of the main peak was unchanged. These experiments showed that chondrocytes activated by TNF or IL-I caused a similar limited proteolysis of the proteoglycans.",

The medium was changed at 3 days and the culture was terminated after 6 days. Human TNFa was a recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously7.22. Porcine IL-l was a natural leukocyte protein purified to homogeneity as described elsewhere!6. The pI 5 form rather than the pI 8 form was used for these experiments.

After culture, the cartilage pieces were separated from the medium, briefly blotted to remove excess medium, and then weighted.

The lower potency of the human TNFa compared with porcine IL-1 may be due to species differences. Taken together, the experiments demonstrate that TNFa has a similar action to IL-1 on chondrocytes. It causes them to degrade proteoglycan by limited proteolysis and inhibits their synthesis of new proteoglycan. Exposure of cartilage to either of these leukocyte products during inflammation could lead to loss of proteoglycan and impairment of function; furthermore, their effects may be additive.",

Since they are apparently not homologous 8 ,16, IL-1 and TNFa would be expected to combine with different receptors. These considerations suggest that chondrocytes (and probably other connective tissue cells) could have two distinct types of receptor (one for IL-1 and one for TNF) whose interaction with ligand promotes resorption of matrix polymers while inhibiting their synthesis.
