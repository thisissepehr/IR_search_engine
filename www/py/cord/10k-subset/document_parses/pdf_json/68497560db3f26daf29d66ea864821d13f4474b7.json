In this regard, many diverse conditions (e. g., sepsis, multiple trauma, pancreatitis), result in the generalized intravascular activation of inflammatory cells with endothelial and/or parenchymal injury. Evidence indicates increasingly that the pathophysiology of the host inflammatory response is mediated by cytokines, which are extracellular signalling proteins secreted by effector cells. These molecules have as their primary function the ability to modify the behaviour of other closely adjacent cells [10] .

If the intravascular inflammatory response becomes uncontrolled or excessive, the vascular endothelium will be damaged, leading to distant organ injury [11] . Regardless of the underlying insult, the response of the host is to initiate an inflammatory response, resulting in the release of numerous mediators, in particular the cytokines, into the circulation [9] . Cytokines are generally divided into pro-and anti-inflammatory mediators, which have opposite effects in mediating inflammatory reactions. In patients with septic or traumatic shock, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL) 1 and, to a lesser extent, other cytokines appear to potentiate organ injury by inducing a change in endothelial cells from a non-inflammatory to a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Activated endothelial cells express surface receptors, such as E-selectin, Pselectin, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), that promote leukocyte adherence. These pro-inflammatory cells also express and/or secrete factors, such as IL-6, IL-8, and platelet-activating factor, that attract or activate other cells which further fuel the inflammatory response. The shift in endothelial phenotype ultimately results in focal microvascular thrombosis and leukocyte-mediated endothelial injury. Similarly, inflammatory factors, such as complement fragments and eicosanoids, activate circulating neutrophils and upregulate complement receptor expression, thereby increasing neutrophil adhesiveness and consequently neutrophil endothelial binding [11] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 450, "end": 454, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 658, "end": 661, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1819, "end": 1823, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "M.

Cytokines exert their effects by binding to their membrane receptors and activating intracellular signal transduction pathways, leading to alterations of targeted cells. Each of these steps may be a target for therapeutic manipulations. Important regulatory control on cytokine action is exerted by cytokineneutralizing molecules that are classified as soluble receptors and receptor antagonists of cytokines [13] . The counterbalance between the plasma concentration of a cytokine and its neutralizing molecules determines the expression of bioactivity of that particular cytokine. Cytokine activity can be regulated in a number of ways by these cytokine-binding proteins that are present in the micro-environment. For example, in the case of TNFa, the circulating TNFa binding proteins may bind to TNFa, limiting access of TNFa to the membrane-bound receptor and hence acting to neutralize TNFa. However, it is also possible that this intravascular binding of TNFa may prevent its degradation and thus prolong TNFa activity, albeit at lower levels [14] . Other binding molecules, including several acute phase proteins (e. g., a 2-macroglobulin), may influence the biological activity of several growth factors and cytokines, thus also playing an important role in attenuating or modifying the kinetics of circulating cytokines [15] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 131, "end": 135, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 547, "end": 551, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1188, "end": 1192, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1468, "end": 1472, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "M.

One approach is to use an assay that can provide a rapid estimate of the particular cytokine, thereby identifying patients most likely to benefit. A rapid, semi-quantitative IL-6 dipstick test is currently being tested and may be useful in future clinical trials [8] . Another approach is to identify patients who may be particularly sensitive to the development of a disease or sensitive to poor outcome, based upon the expression of a gene dictating particular susceptibility.

Secondly, these molecular-based approaches, with their inherent specificity, are usually designed to target a particular molecule.

Alternatively, blocking common intra-cellular pathways initiated by multiple cytokines could also be more effective than approaches targeting only one cytokine.
