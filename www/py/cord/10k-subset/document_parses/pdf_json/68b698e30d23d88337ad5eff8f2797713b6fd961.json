Second, while infiltrating with local anaesthetic, pass the needle through the cricothryroid membrane aspirating air to identify the trachea and spray local anaesthetic onto the mucosa to reduce coughing and venous bleeding on incision. Finally, when the short, guarded scalpel blade is correctly inserted through the cricothyroid membrane it will usually stand there with a little support from an assistant. The left hand remains splinting the tissues on each side of the blade while the other hand picks up and aligns the introducer. The blade is then lifted clear by the assistant allowing immediate, easy insertion of the introducer.",

Neutrophil elastase (HNE) is a constituent of the primary (azurophil) granules of the human neutrophil and is released as the result of neutrophil activation [1] . In addition to degrading elastin, this protease enzyme acts against a wide range of other substrates including fibrinogen, complement components, fibronectin, plasminogen and immunoglobulins. It is currently believed to be important in the genesis of inflammatory tissue injury. Measurement of released neutrophil elastase provides a sensitive indicator of neutrophil activation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether neutrophil elastase plasma levels were elevated during the trauma process, together with the time course and levels involved.",

The concentrations of neutrophil elastase in the samples were subsequently measured using a radio-immunoassay technique for human neutrophil elastase similar to that of Plow [2] . The antibody used was produced in-house using rabbit polyclonal antisera. The antigen used was purified from human neutrophils after leucopboresis and was pure by gel electrophoresis. (The antigen was supplied courtesy of Dr. R Davies, Merck, Sharp and Dome Ltd). The antibody has absolute specificity for neutrophil elastase and does not cross-react with pancreatic or platelet elastases. It detects HNE equally well as the free enzyme or when HNE is complexed with its inhibitors. The coefficient of variation within and between assays was less than 5%.",

In addition, both authors used frequencies which were for the most part much higher than were utilized in this experiment. Eliasen [5] used a jet ventilator and specifically stated that no \"auto-PEEP\" was found at frequencies less than 5 Hz. Rouby [6] found that HFJV induced a \"PEEP effect\" but considered that it was only significant in patients with normal or increased lung compliance and specifically recommended the jet ventilator for \"all types of respiratory failure characterized by decreased lung volumes, low pulmonary compliance, or chest wall rigidity\", a description that would fit the model utilized by Hachenberg et al. It would therefore appear that none of these papers supports the assumptions about \"auto-PEEP\" in this model. It is possible that use of HFJV with lower frequency, higher drive pressure and the application of PEEP would have resulted in the authors coming to a different conclusion about the relative value of HFJV and CPPV in the acutely injured lung.",

However, the absolute bicarbonate loss in the ultrafiltrate was consecutively less with each treatment, being 513 mmol for the first and 342 mmol for the fifth. Thus bicarbonate loss cannot be the explanation. Hyperlactataemia results in the intracelhilar accumulation of lactate, and in vitro this has been shown to reduce the cytosolic phosphorylation potential and so reduce the amount of ATP available for energy dependent metabolism and cell function [4] . In vivo lactate accumulation has been shown to affect cardiac function by reducing ventricular muscle contraction [5] . It may be that in patients with severe liver failure, who have disturbances of tissue oxygen delivery that hyperlactatemia by affecting cellular energy dependent mechanisms causes a vicious circle to develop, and that bicarbonate based fluids are required in the management of these special cases.",

On admission, the patient was somnolent and mildly icteric, without fever. Physical examination revealed a left ptosis, liver enlargement, petechial put-pura on the legs and hands but no splenomegaly nor lymphadenopathy. Liver cytolysis (SGOT 480 IU/L, SGPT 232/L), non-oliguric acute renal failure (serum creatinine 541pmol/1) and profound hyponatremia (plasma sodium 112 retool/l) were noted. The prothrombin time was 67\u00b070 and the fibrinogen level was 1.6 g/1. 31 h later, she developed seizures, despite a normalized plasma sodium, and required intubation, mechanical ventilation and IV barbiturate therapy. Her CSF was clear and contained 3 mrnol/1 glucose, 0.68g/1 protein and 40 lymphocytes/ml. Cerebral computed tomography was normal. Simultaneously blood leukopenia and thrombopenia developed (WBC count: 4200/ml, 66\u00b070 neutrophils at DO and 1800/ml, 29\u00b07o neutrophils at D2; platelet count 25 000/ml at DO and 10000/ml at D2). Bone marrow smears demonstrated proliferation of large histiocytes with erythocyte and neutrophil hemophagocytosis, no abnormal cells were seen. From DI3, the bone marrow aplasia reversed with a significant reduction of histiocytic proliferation and renal function improved, as did liver function. The conscious level improved slowly allowing spontaneous ventilation via a tracheotomy tube. The seizures persisted and continued IV therapy was required. Septic shock associated with a venous catheter led to death 5 months later. Cultures of blood, urine, respiratory secretions, CSF and stools (which were also inoculated into suckling mice) were negative for bacteria, parasites and viruses. Cerebral and hepatic biopsy tissue showed non-specific inflammatory lesions and were sterile on culture. Serological tests for a broad spectrum of agents showed no evidence for infection with the exception of neutralizing antibodies against coxsackie A9 (Fig. 1) . Serology was also negative for other enteroviruses (echoviruses 7, 8, 11; coxsaekie B 4 and B 5). A part from the serum neopterin and the neopterin/creatinine ratio being 10 times the normal value (Fig. 1) , the rest of the immunological workup was normal.",

The high levels of neopterin production related to acute viral infection in renal transplantation [1, 4] , is an additional, although non-specific, indication of viral infection in our patient. As the production of neopterin by macrophages is induced by gamma interferon released from activated T lympho-cytes, we speculate that this activation of macrophages contributed to the histiocytic proliferation.",
