The objective of this study was to classify the invasiveness of alien species that have invaded the Upper Burdekin Catchment in Queensland, Australia, at three spatial scales. A combination of three published weed classification frameworks and multivariate techniques were employed to classify species based on their frequency and cover at a range of spatial scales. We surveyed the Upper Burdekin Catchment for alien species, and for each species determined the following distribution indices -site frequency, total cover, transect frequency per site frequency and quadrat frequency per site frequency, cover per quadrat when present, cover per transect when present, and cover per site when present. These indices capture the effect of species abundance and frequency between sites (site frequency and total cover), within sites (transect frequency per site and cover per transect when present), and within transects (quadrat frequency per site frequency and cover per site). They were used to classify the species into seven groups using a hierarchical cluster analysis. The relationship between the indices was explored to determine how effective the small scale, site-specific indices were at predicting the broader, landscape-scale patterns. Strong correlations were observed between transect frequency per site and frequency ( r 2 = 0.89) and cover per transect when present and total cover ( r 2 = 0.62). This suggests that if a weed is abundant at the site level, it has the potential to occupy large areas of the catchment. The species groupings derived from the application of the three published weed classification frameworks were compared graphically to the groupings derived from the cluster analysis. One of the frameworks classified species into three groups. The other two frameworks classified species into four groups. There was a high degree of subjectivity in applying the frameworks to the survey data. Some of the data were of no relevance to the classification frameworks and were therefore ignored. We suggest that the weed classification frameworks should be used in conjunction with existing multivariate techniques to ensure that classifications capture important natural variations in observed data that may reflect invasion processes. The combined use of the frameworks and multivariate techniques enabled us to aggregate species into categories appropriate for management.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "New species entering a landscape are subject to community-level processes and may or may not become invasive.

(2000) comprised three components: introduction, naturalization, and invasion. Introduction implies that the species has been transported by humans across major geographical boundaries. Naturalization occurs when the species has overcome abiotic and biotic barriers to survival and can cope with environmental stochasticity. Invasion occurs when the species produces reproductive offspring distant from the parent and culminates in new self-perpetuating populations. Six key barriers that limit the spread of introduced plants were defined to enable researchers to classify species into one of the three categories (Table 1) . Py s ek et al . (2004) recently discussed further details on the use and application of Richardson et al . (2000) 's framework. Davis & Thompson (2000) proposed a scheme modeled after Rabinowitz's (1981) classification of rarity, to distinguish 'invaders' as distinct from 'successional colonizers' and 'non-invasive colonizers' . The authors defined eight different types of 'colonizers' Table 1 Data requirements to implement the weed classification framework devised by Richardson et al. (2000) ; Colautti & MacIsaac (2004) ; Davis & Thompson (2000) Introduction Barrier based on three distinct characteristics: dispersal distance (short/ long), uniqueness (novel/common to the region colonized), and impact on the new environment (small/great) ( Table 1 ). The interpretation of dispersal distance and the origin of the colonizer are scale dependent, while impact may be assessed from either a productivity or an ecosystem function. Colautti & MacIsaac (2004) recently proposed a framework that attempted to eliminate the need for universal definitions of current terms by using operational terms with no a priori meaning (i.e. as one of five possible stages) in a process based model. The first Stage (0) begins when a propagule enters the habitat of interest. A species proceeds through Stage 1, dispersal and survival in the habitat, and Stage 2, survival and reproduction. If the weed satisfies these criteria, it may then be classified into separate stages that describe the frequency and abundance of a species in an environment. Stage 3 species are considered localized and numerically rare. Stage 4a species are widespread but rare, Stage 4b species are localized but dominant in those localities, and Stage 5 species are considered widespread and dominant (Table 1) . Again, the environment can be any region of interest. The definitions of widespread and abundant are also open to interpretation. In essence, all three frameworks put forward a series of hypotheses that can be applied to data to classify the invasive characteristics of a species. The data requirements necessary to implement the frameworks vary, although each draws heavily on frequency and abundance information to classify the invasive characteristics of a species.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 17, "end": 42, "text": "Richardson et al .

Three measures of frequency were also defined: site frequency, transect frequency per site frequency, and quadrat frequency per site frequency. These were simply derived from the three frequency indices presented in Table 2 . Site frequency was the number of sites where the species was present.

These frameworks put forward a series of hypotheses about the process of invasion and are intended to enable ecologists to qualitatively assess characteristics of invasive species and group them concordantly. The three frameworks require different criteria to perform the classifications. Application of the frameworks is further complicated by the subjective interpretation of classification criteria and implementation of the classification systems. Taxonomic classification systems, such as soil classifications (e.g. Isbell, 1996) or land systems (e.g. Tongway & Hindley, 1995) , traditionally use a key that can be repeatedly applied to the soil or to a landscape. The classification systems employed in the present study have not been developed to the extent of soil or landscape classification systems, possibly because the data necessary to evaluate their performance was unavailable. Their application is invariably subjective. For example, if we had considered species occupying more than 20 sites to be 'widespread' (Colautti & MacIsaac, 2004) and 'long-distance dispersers' (Davis & Thompson, 2000) , then the number of species categorized as Stage 5 widespread and abundant (Colautti & MacIsaac, 2004) and longdistance, common with great impact, would have increased from five to eight species. Every application of these frameworks is likely to be different and arguably site and scale specific, with different interpretations of what is frequent, abundant, local, common, high-impact, or long-distance dispersal. The frameworks were also unable to make use of additional available data, such as the cross-scale indices used in this study. Given these limitations, it seems unlikely that widespread application of these frameworks, in their current form, can advance the field of invasion ecology.

This subjectivity exists at two levels. First, the decision to cut the dendrogram at a height of seven is arbitrary. Cutting at a height of 12 would have resulted in just three groups and yielded groupings synonymous with those derived from the classification frameworks. For example, groups 2 and 3 would have been amalgamated, even though group 3 species were present, on average in 12 more sites but occupied just 10% of the quadrat when present. In contrast, group 2 species occupied 23% of the quadrat. We consider it productive to preserve this variation in the data since it potentially reflects key differences in modes of invasive spread that should be considered in management. Thus, group 2 species, while having the capability to become regionally common, probably through a greater capacity for long-distance spread, rarely become locally dominant. In contrast, group 3 species appear to spread well locally and become dominant where they occur but at present have not dispersed as widely. In practical terms, management strategies could target group 3 species because they have yet to disperse widely. They may also pose a greater threat to the ecosystem simply because they occupy a larger portion of the quadrat and transect when present. Alternatively, group 2 species have demonstrated proficiency for dispersal. If this trend continued, these species could threaten a much larger area, but with slightly lower levels of cover than group 3 species. Group 4 species displayed a similar penchant for dispersal, but occupied very minor portions of the transect or quadrat. These are arguably the hardest species to classify with confidence. Because they are successful dispersers, they have the potential to threaten the ecosystem, although at this point in time their effect is minor. Our interpretations of the effect of species from group 5 and group 6 are also based on the frequency and abundance data at this point in time. Their presence and overall effect in the catchment are minor. However, our analyses and interpretations are limited by the data available. Additional information, such as time since introduction into the catchment may alter the assessment, but these data were unavailable for most species. Some species may still be adapting, or may not have had the opportunity to establish a sufficiently large population to create a problem.

The similarities between the seven variables imply that meaningful classifications of invasive species can be achieved with a reduced sampling effort. The simple site level indices derived in this study also provide insights into how invasive a species may become at a larger scale. The particularly strong relationship between cover per transect and total cover in the landscape suggests that, if a species consistently occupies more than 10% of a transect in a specific habitat, then it has the potential to impact and invade that habitat. The link between these scales is worthy of further study to determine the relationship between local and regional impact by species at a certain stage in the invasion process. It may be argued that a species that occupied even a small portion of the landscape in one location has overcome many of the barriers to colonization identified in Richardson et al., 2000' s framework and has the potential to invade similar habitats, providing a dispersal mechanism exists. Both quantitative and qualitative forms of classification are developed to enable researchers and managers to classify an invasion and determine which species have dispersed widely and had the greatest impact on the ecosystem. Both have limitations. The classification techniques provide a means for classifying an invasion based on a series of hypotheses that describe an invasion.
