Linden's group conducted a series of ex vivo and in vivo experiments to test whether the vascular administration of ATL313 protects the lungs against ischemia-reperfusion injury, which remains a major complication after organ transplant. In the first study, they used isolated, buffer-perfused murine lungs to determine whether the therapeutic potential of ATL313 targets the resident cells [139] . Their model of ischemiareperfusion significantly impaired pulmonary functions (higher airway resistance and pulmonary artery pressure, lower compliance), caused extensive tissue injury (vascular leakage and edema) and lung inflammation (BAL levels of TNFa, KC, MIP-2 and RANTES). These lung complications were all significantly attenuated by a bolus dose of ATL313 (30 nM) added to the perfusate at the onset of reperfusion. This dose had no significant effect on the lung functions or hemodynamics of control animals. The specificity of the receptor agonist was demonstrated using lung isolated from A 2A R \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, which showed no reduction in lung complications in response to ATL313. The fact that vascular ATL313 attenuated lung inflammation in the absence of circulating blood reiterates the critical role of the A 2A R for the maintenance endothelial barrier integrity (see Chap. 8, Fig. 8.1 ).

When each agonist was paired with its antagonist, the protective effects were lost. More importantly, the ATL313 treatment improved lung functions and reduced neutrophil recruitment more efficiently than the A 1 R and A 3 R agonists, supporting a superior protective effect during lung transplant. In another study, these authors used the same protocol to show that the addition of ATL313 1 h before ischemia offers the same degree of protection [141] .

Based on BAL neutrophil myeloperoxidase activity and immunohistochemistry, ATL313 was also shown to inhibit the infiltration of neutrophils and CD4+ T cells during reperfusion. It is common knowledge that the number of circulating neutrophils is regulated by IL-17A, a cytokine released by the CD4+ T lymphocytes (review: [145] ).

This disease is caused by an aberrant metabolism of arachidonic acid (review: [169] ). The two products, prostaglandins and leukotrienes, bind to specific cell surface G protein-coupled receptors to orchestrate airway defenses. Prostaglandins stimulate mucociliary clearance, inhibit the development of fibrosis and the activities of inflammatory cells. In contrast, leukotrienes promote the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells, mucus secretion, vascular permeability, fibrosis and bronchoconstriction.

Since eosinophils represent <10% of all cells recruited to the airways, their response to ASA would be overlooked by total cell counts. Interestingly, ASA also caused a dramatic increase in lung ADO levels in the OVA/LPS mice. Expression analysis of the enzymes regulating ADO indicated that LPS selectively up-regulates ADA.

We have reached a point where we can learn from success stories and failures to refine our drug development strategies. For instance, we heard about the potential of the \"low-hanging fruits\", like Adagen (PEG-ADA) initially developed for ADA-SCID. The tale of the A 1 R antagonist, Theophylline, shows how revisiting the properties of an inefficient bronchodilator lead to the discovery of a welltolerated anti-inflammatory drug currently prescribed to asthmatics, in combination with a b-adrenergic bronchodilator. While A 2A R agonists were once perceived as the most promising anti-inflammatory drugs for chronic respiratory diseases, the frequent reports of cardiovascular side-effects are redirecting these compounds toward surgical applications, to prevent the hypertension and acute lung injury resulting from ischemia-reperfusion. Our gaze is turned toward A 2B R antagonists for the suppression of airway hyperresponsiveness. Furthermore, animal studies suggest that long-term treatments could reverse airway remodeling and fibrosis in chronic airway diseases. Finally, clinical trials support the benefits of A 3 R agonists for inflammatory disorders and acute lung injury. Therapeutic applications for ATP receptor ligands are also emerging. For instance, denufosol has entered the final stage of clinical evaluation for the improvement of P2Y 2 R-mediated airway clearance in CF patients. And animal studies suggest that P2X7R antagonists may suppress the production of the \"first wave\" pro-inflammatory mediator, IL-1b, as well as tissue damage by apoptosis. In conclusion, we are clearly witnessing the maturation of a young field of clinical research which will, no doubt, continue to fascinate and surprise us for years to come.
