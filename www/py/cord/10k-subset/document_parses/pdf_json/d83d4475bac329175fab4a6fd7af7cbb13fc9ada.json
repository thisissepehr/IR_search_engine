Despite the frequent deployment of HFOV, randomized controlled trials remain elusive and currently there are no pediatric trials looking at its use. Our longitudinal study analyzed the predictive clinical outcome of HFOV in pediatric AHRF given disease-specific morbidity. Methods A retrospective 8-year review on pediatric intensive care unit admissions with AHRF ventilated by HFOV was performed. Primary outcomes included survival, morbidity, length of stay (LOS), and factors associated with survival or mortality. Results A total of 102 patients underwent HFOV with a 66 % overall survival rate. Survivors had a greater LOS than nonsurvivors (p = 0.001). Mortality odds ratio (OR) for patients without bronchiolitis was 8.19 (CI = 1.02, 65.43), and without pneumonia it was 3.07 (CI = 1.12, 8.39). A lower oxygenation index (OI) after HFOV commencement and at subsequent time points analyzed predicted survival. After 24 h, mortality was associated with an OI [ 35 [OR = 31.11 (CI = 3.25, 297.98)]. Sepsisrelated mortality was associated with a higher baseline FiO 2 (0.88 vs. 0.65), higher OI (42 vs. 22), and augmented metabolic acidosis (pH of 7.25 vs. 7.32) evaluated 4 h on HFOV (p \\ 0.05).

Ventilatory strategies for ARDS continue to evolve, with emphasis on protective lung strategy and low tidal volume ventilation based on the landmark 2000 ARMA trial [4] . Several modes of ventilation have been advocated, including highfrequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Prospective clinical trials on HFOV for ARDS have been inconsistent, although recent meta-analyses suggested that HFOV may improve survival and is unlikely to cause harm in ARDS patients [10, 11] . A multicenter pediatric crossover study did show that HFOV was associated with higher mean airway pressures (Paw), improved oxygenation, and a reduced need for supplemental oxygen at 30 days [12] . Furthermore, a neonatal randomized controlled trial demonstrated lower mortality in very-lowbirth-weight babies managed with HFOV [13] . Our large tertiary-care children's hospital has been utilizing HFOV for a decade as rescue therapy for patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) in accordance with a permissive ventilation protocol.

We believe our permissive ventilation guidelines are similar to those of other PICUs, although some may utilize higher PEEP before employing HFOV. We also recognize our unit has a bias toward early HFOV for AHRF. Some of this comes from the difficulty with ventilating infants with low tidal volumes when their intrinsic respiratory rates are high.

Most patients with standard bronchiolitis during the study period were managed with conventional ventilation and did not develop AHRF. In our experience there is a spectrum of disease and those who develop AHRF generally have bronchoalveolar disease. Additionally, patients diagnosed with pneumonia (viral or bacterial) who were treated with HFOV also had statistically improved survival. Both of these groups of patients showed early and sustained improvement in oxygenation when placed on HFOV.
