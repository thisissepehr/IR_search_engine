Although most coronavirus infections in humans are mild, they have recently caused 2 major pandemics: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), with mortality rates of 10% and 37%, respectively. 1 SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a type of coronavirus first discovered and isolated in December 2019 in Wuhan, central China, that is the cause of the current pandemic known as COVID-19.",

            "text": "The pathophysiology of this virus is still unknown. Various studies indicate that patients infected with COVID-19 have high concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, interferon (IFN) gamma, IFN-inducible protein (IP)-10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1. It has been shown that patients with severe illness have higher concentrations of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), IP-10, MCP-1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1A, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, indicating that the severity of the illness could be determined by cytokine storm. 2 Patients infected by COVID-19 with cardiac injury have noticeably higher plasma concentrations of IL-6, 3,4 N-terminal fraction of pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and cardiac troponins (cTnI/T). Because cytokine storm is also the main pathophysiologic mechanism in fulminant myocarditis, it is reasonable to consider heart damage due to COVID-19.",

The literature on myocarditis due to coronaviruses is scant, but cardiac injury seems to be more common in patients infected by COVID-19 than in patients infected by other coronaviruses. 5 We describe the case of a 59-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, cervical degenerative arthropathy, chronic lumbar radiculopathy, lymph node tuberculosis diagnosed due to erythema nodosum, and migraine.

Chest X-ray indicated mild signs of vascular redistribution, with no infiltrations (figure 1B). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for viruses in the nasopharyngeal swab specimen was positive for SARS-CoV-2 and negative for adenovirus and influenza A and B viruses, with a positive epidemiologic environment (family members with fever and respiratory symptoms in previous days). Laboratory work revealed elevated troponins (TnT, 220-1100 ng/dL) and NT-proBNP (4421 ng/L), mild leukocytosis (14.17 \u00c2 10 9 /L), lymphocytes (2.59 \u00c2 10 9 /L), CRP 10 mg/L, and D-dimer at 24 hours (23 242 ng/mL). Echocardiography disclosed moderate concentric hypertrophy, diminished intraventricular volumes with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction without segmental abnormalities, and moderate pericardial effusion with no clear signs of hemodynamic deterioration. Due to a clinical picture indicative of myocarditis (diffuse concave ST-segment elevation, fever, pericardial effusion, and myocardial thickening) and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction without segmental abnormalities, coronary angiography was not performed due to a low clinical suspicion of acute coronary syndrome. In the Coronary Unit, during implantation of a Swan-Ganz catheter, the patient experienced rapid hemodynamic deterioration, exhibiting electrical activity with no pulse and requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation, emergent pericardiocentesis (drainage of serous fluid), and high-dose vasopressors for hemodynamic recovery.",
