Calcineurin inhibitor therapy is an important cause of renal dysfunction in heart transplant patients. Sirolimus (Srl) is a novel immunosuppressive (IS) drug without nephrotoxic side effects.

Introduction. Giant-cell myocarditits (GCM) is a rare and frequently fatal disorder of unknown origin that is defined histopathologically as diffuse myocardial necrosis with multinucleated giant cells in the absence of sarcoid-like granuloma. Patients usually have ventricular arrhythmias or congestive heart failure. Although a variety of systemic disorders have been seen in association with giant cell mycocarditis, most cases occur in previously healthy adults. Conclusive diagnosis requires histologic analysis of myocardial tissue obtained by endomyocardial biopsy (EMB). Congestive heart failure (CHF) is the most common cardiac presentation (75%), with sustained, refractory ventricular tachycardia. The case presented here is that of a 65-old-man suffering of GCM in whom an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) had to be implanted to overcome cardiogenic shock. Antithymocyte gobuline (rATG, Thymoglobuline, Sangstat), respectively ciclosporine (INN: cyclosporine), Mycophenolate and steroids were utilized to bridge the time to complete myocardial recovery. We are reporting the first successful implantation and bridging to myocardial regeneration in a patient suffering of GCM by means of ECMO and initiation of immunomodulating drugs including polyclonal rATG.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "V20"}, {"text": "Clinical summary. A 65-year-old man was admitted to a public hospital because of thoracic pain, positive heart enzymes, and a highly pathologic electrocardiogramm. Echocardiography demonstrated a pericardial effusion and reduced left ventricular function (LVF, EF 15%). Performed angiography evidenced and a high-grade stenosis of the Left anterior descending (LAD) which led to stent implantation. Despite stent placement, the clinical condition worsened leading to cardiogenic shock including incipient shock liver. In this clinical condition the patient was transferred to our institution. In addition, the patient developed malign ventricular tachycardia (Lowen IV) and had to undergo repetitive defibrillation. In this clinical scenario it was decided to implant a femoral veno-arterial ECMO. The patient's metabolic data improved noticeably; however, due to repeated ventricular tachycardia, the patient had to be defibrillated multiple times (max. 30\u00d7/d). To define exact cardiac pathology, we performed a heart biopsy with the pathology of GCM. Immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine (50 mg/d), Mycophenolate and Prednisolon (250 mg/d) was initiated. In addition, rabbit ATG (rATG, Thymoglobuline, Sangstat) at the dosage of 75 mg/d was added to the therapy. This drug therapy was continued for 5 days. Of note is the fact that with initiation of rATG, cardiac fibrillation episodes abated immediately. Routinely performed echo-cardiography (TEE) revealed an improvement in ventricular function, and one week after ECMO support, we were able to wean the patient from extracorporeal support. Moreover, a routine biopsy after 14 days revealed complete remission of GCM in the heart tissue. An intracardial defibrillator (ICD) was additionally implanted. Three months after emergency admission to our department the patient was discharged. Continuous medication of Prednisolon 5 mg/d, Mycophenolat mofetil 500 mg/d, and Plavix 75 mg/d was prescribed. 12 month after initial event the patient describes NYHA class I heart function and echocardiography reveals an moderate impairment of heart function (EF 55%). Immunosuppressive with low-dose steroid and Mycophenolate drug regimen is continued as the patient describes no side effects.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "V20"}, {"text": "Discussion. This report adds to the available knowledge of giant-cell myocarditis by providing that (a) ECMO implantation is feasible if the patient is demonstrating acute haemodynamic deterioration because of biventricular dilation and medically intractable ventricular fibrillation and (b) after verified histological diagnosis of GCM immunemodulation with cyclosporine/mycophenolate with additional application of rATG is feasible with favourable outcome. In various studies, patients with GCM were treated with immunosuppression (cyclosporine, steroids, murine monoclonal antibodies [OKT-3]) and even assist device as bridge to transplantation. Heart transplantation has shown to be successful as method of treatment. Autoimmune diseases and its mechanisms were suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of GCM. Most recently, a novel mechanism of action of immunoglobulin was proposed to be due to anti-inflammatory activities through the inhibitory Fc receptos (FcRs). It has been suggested that T-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases is the result of inappropriate antigen presentation of either a self-antigen or an antigen with the capacity to mimic a self-antigen in the peripheral lymphoid tissues. Relevant to this novel application of rATG, polyclonal suspensions like IgM/G, IVIg containing Fc receptors and have been demonstrated to be beneficiary in autoimmune myocarditis. In an elegant study by Shioji et al. IVIg was highly effective in ameliorating experimental myocarditis. However it has to be mentioned that immunoglobulin treatment failed to ameliorate myocarditis. In respect to our patient suffering of RCM Fc containing rATG provided remarkable clinical benefit. Background.

Ascites was evaluated as independent risk factor for death on the waiting list. No significant difference in the serum sodium levels were found between patients suffering from ascites or not. Therefore complications of portal hypertension should be treated adequately and rigorously, especially in patients with lower MELD scores. Renal failure is an established risk factor for impaired patient outcome after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). As the endothelin pathway is known to be involved in the development of acute renal failure (ARF), we designed a study to clarify its role in ARF following OLT. 20 consecutive patients with intact kidney function scheduled for their first OLT were prospectively studied. Plasma big endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels were measured before surgery, after graft reperfusion, and on the first and second postoperative days. According to postoperative GFR, patients were assigned to the acute renal dysfunction group (ARDF) and the non-ARDF group. Each patient's GFR was estimated according to the four variable formula used in the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease before surgery, daily within the first postoperative week, and at 1, 3, 12 and 24 months after surgery. Postoperative mean big ET-1 lev-els correlated significantly with the maximum percent decrease of GFR within 3 days after OLT (P < 0.01). The proportion of patients who developed ARDF was significantly correlated to mean postoperative big ET-1 quartiles (P < 0.01). In the ARDF group, the percent decrease of GFR within 24 months was significantly higher (P < 0.05) as compared to the non-ARDF group. In conclusion, patients who develop acute renal dysfunction immediately after OLT do not fully recover to baseline regarding long-term kidney function. Short-term GFR was significantly correlated with postoperative big ET-1 plasma levels, suggesting renal dysfunction is mediated by the activated endothelin system. Background. With improved survival of liver transplant recipients, chronic renal failure has become an important cause of morbidity and is associated with a high mortality.

On the basis of our data, the overall survival of HCV transplanted patients were similiar to other indications. Recurrent HCV infection did not influence patient and graft survival. Immunosuppression may have an impact on survival in HCV-positive recipients, but optimal regimens need to be better defined by prospective studies. The advent of highly sensitive molecular techniques has revealed the possible persistence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) genomes in HBsAg-negative patients with or without serologic markers of previous infection, a state called occult HBV infection. The highest prevalence of such infection has been shown in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Some studies suggested that occult HBV infection might favor or accelerate the progression of HCV infection towards cirrhosis. HCV infection recurs almost in all patients after liver transplantation (LT). About 5-10% of LT patients develop a fibrosing cholestatic HCV recurrence, which is associated with a very poor outcome. No specific risk factor for this pattern of recurrence has been described so far. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of occult HBV infection in patients presenting with fibrosing cholestatic HCV recurrence after LT. Between 1986 and 2004, 151 HCV patients (104 m; 47 f) underwent LT at our institution. The mean follow-up was 51 months (range, 1-228 months). The diagnosis of recurrence was based on biochemical and histologic parameters. Genotype 1 was predominant (75%), followed by 2 (15%), 3 (8%), and 4 (3%). Eleven patients (7.3%; 10 m, 1 f) developed a fibrosing cholestatic pattern of recurrence characterized by highly elevated cholestatic parameters and typical histologic findings. Also in this group, genotype 1 was predominant (N = 7), three had type 3, and one type 4. Serum HBV DNA was tested with the TaqMan test (Roche, Austria). Five patients were HBsAg negative, whereas six had serologic markers (antiHBc positive). Interestingly, HBV DNA could not be detected in the sera of any of these patients with fibrosing cholestatic HCV recurrence. The actuarial 1-, 2-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates of all HCV patients were 83%, 79%, 68%, and 60%. HCV recurrence did not show a negative impact on patient and graft survival; however, the outcome of the patients with the fibrosing cholestatic pattern was less favorable. Seven out of 11 patients died due to HCV recurrence, one patient had to be retransplanted secondary to recurrent disease. Only three patients are alive with a functioning first allograft. This study indicates that occult HBV infection is not associated with fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis C recurrence after LT. Background. The use of grafts from hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBcAB)-positive donors for liver transplantation (LT) is associated with the risk of de novo hepatitis B.

Three cases of de novo acute posttransplant hepatitis B were identified, one being acquired during unprotected intercourse and two being transmitted through the graft.

The impact of preLT chemoembolisation (CE) on patient survival and incidence of HCC recurrence has been controversially discussed and remains undetermined. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of CE prior to LT in HCC patients with regard to tumor recurrence and patient outcome. Between 1984 and 2004, 167 HCC patients (142 m; 25 f) underwent LT at our institution. The underlying liver disease was viral hepatitis in 87 (HCV 69, HBV 18), alcoholic liver cirrhosis in 49, and other diseases in 18 patients. According to Child-Pugh classification, 75 patients presented with Child A, 79 with stage B and 9 with stage C. HCCs were diagnosed according to the EASL guidelines. On the basis of preLT radiology, 23 patients were diagnosed with stage I, 79 stage II, 34 stage III, and 31 stage IV according to the modified UICC criteria. CE was performed in 120 patients prior to LT. In 47 patients no treatment was performed prior to LT. Patients underwent multiple cycles of CE (mean, 1.6 CE/patient). CE response prior to CE was assessed by CT scan. On explant histology, complete response with no evidence of vital tumor was found in 38 of 120 (32%) patients, 55 (46%) patients showed a partial remission (tumor necrosis, >50%), and 27 (22%) patients showed a poor response or even progression. The intention-totreat analysis showed that patients with early-stage HCC showed an excellent survival with a 1-, 5-, and 10-year rate of 98%, 69% and 69%, respectively. CE prior to LT had no positive effect on overall patient outcome and rate of recurrence. However, patients with complete response to CE, on the basis of both pre LT and post LT histology, had a significantly bet-ter long-term survival (1-, 5-, and 10-year rates of 98%, 91%, and 91%) and rate of recurrence compared to those with partial or no response, but only in patients within Milan and not San Francisco criteria. The 1-, 5-, and 10-years survival rates of patients with advanced HCC were 95%, 67%, and 35%. HCC recurrence was found in 24 patients, 11 of 24 presented with advanced stage (III and IV). Only 13 had undergone CE prior to LT, and 9 of those were nonresponders to CE. This study indicates that response to preLT CE may predict the outcome of HCC patients after LT. Patients with early-stage HCC, who responded to CE pre LT, showed an excellent outcome with 5-and 10-year survival rates around 90%. Patients with early-stage HCC and only partial or no response to CE had a higher risk of recurrence of HCC after LT, but outcome was still favorable compared with advanced-stage tumors regardless of CE response. The roles of the regenerative factors hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), transforming growth factor a (TGF-a), and of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were described in the context of hypertrophy and regeneration after liver resection but not well known in the transplantation situation. In the recipients of 63 consecutive liver transplantations with a graft survival of >2 weeks, the factors HGF, TGF-a and VEGF were determined postoperatively (day 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14) by an EL-ISA in the serum and correlated to graft survival (Kaplan-Meier). The median concentrations of HGF were constant in total during the observation period (day 1, 2591 pg/ml; day 7, 2434 pg/ml; day 14, 2490 pg/ml). An individual increase to levels above 4000 pg/ml in the middle of the observation period correlated to a significantly decreased one-year graft survival (54% vs. 85%). Similar was the course of TGFa. An increase from the median concentration of 39 pg/ml to levels above 80 pg/ml was observed in the context of a decreased primary function. Regarding VEGF, an almost linear increase of the concentration from 60 pg/ml via 177 pg/ml to 424 pg/ml (day 1, 7, and 14) was observed. Here it became obvious, that an extensive increase of the VEGF concentration correlated to a good transplant function. Under the premise that the systemically determined concentrations were in relevant correlation to the secretion and thus to the local concentration in the liver, it can be concluded that vascular regeneration induced by VEGF substantially contributes to graft survival, whereas a temporal increase of HGF and TGFa rather has to be interpreted as an indicator of an injured graft with a decreased functional prognosis. In total there are about 1650 patients on dialysis in BH and percentage of transplanted is 9.24.

These data, analyzed in a small cohort of patients, show that a sex mismatch between patient and donor may have a negative impact also on outcome after nonmyeloablative HSCT. However, studies with larger and homogeneous cohorts have to be performed to prove these findings. Between 1995 and 2004, 20 patients with chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL), Binet stage B or C (n = 19) or A with risk factors (n = 1) with a median age of 53 (range, 27-62) years underwent autologous (n = 11) or allogeneic (n = 9) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) at the Medical University of Vienna. The median time from diagnosis to HSCT was 29 (range, 6-77) months. Eleven patients underwent autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in partial remission (n = 9) or complete remission (CR) (n = 2) and received Bcell-depleted peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts. Nine patients with refractory disease (n = 6) or chemosensitive relapse (n = 3) underwent allogeneic HSCT with unmanipulated bone marrow (n = 3) or PBSC (n = 6) from sibling (n = 8) or unrelated (n = 1) donors. In the majority, conditioning therapy consisted of total-body irradiation (TBI) of 12-13.2 Gy and cyclophosphamide. Three patients underwent reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) with fludarabine and TBI of 2 Gy. Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis consisted mainly of cyclosporine (CSA) and methotrexate for myeloablative and CSA and mycophenolate mofetil for RIC-HSCT. Complete clinical remission was attained in 10 patients (91%) after ASCT and in 6 (67%) after allogeneic HSCT. Molecular remission assessed by immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IgH) rearrangement PCR was attained in 8 patients after ASCT and 5 after allogeneic HSCT. In seven patients we noticed persistence of the IgH rearrangement, six of these patients died of disease progression or relapse 1-29 months after ASCT (n = 2) or allogeneic HSCT (n = 4). After a median follow-up of 58 (range, 21-122) months, nine autologous (82%) and four allogeneic (44%) graft recipients are alive and 10 patients (ASCT, n = 6; allogeneic HSCT, n = 4) are in clinical and molecular remission. The median time to clinical relapse was 20 (range, 1-102) months. Treatment-related death occurred only in one patient 27 months after myeloablative HSCT. Probability of overall survival is 82% after ASCT and 42% after allogeneic HSCT. In summary, all CLL patients with long-term CR after ASCT and allogeneic HSCT also attained sustained molecular remission of the IgH rearrangement. . The incidences of the observed genotypes in this small group of patients and donors tested were in the range as published: IL10 with 54% C/C, 41% C/A, 5% A/A; NOD2 with 12% recipient or donor; 5% recipient and donor, and MPO with 56% G/G, 43% G/A, 1% A/A. Since the patient population was very heterogeneous concerning diagnosis (34 AML, 12 ALL, 9 NHL, 6 CML, 5 MDS, 4 SAA, 4 solid tumors, 3 MM, 2 OMF, 1 CLL, and 1 ET), course of disease, and condition regimen, patients were divided into four groups for evaluation: 23 with AML and identical high-dose induction therapy (BU/CY), 23 with reduced condition regimen, 6 with unrelated donors, and 29 others. Concerning all 81 patients, 19 of them (23%) died through TRM (3 AML, 6 reduced, 10 others), but none of them was at high risk determined by NOD2 polymorphism (mutated donor and recipient) and only one determined by MPO A/A genotype (AML). Four patients (3 reduced, 1 others) with NOD2 mutations in donor and recipient DNA did not die from TRM. Twenty-three patients developed severe (grade 3 or 4) acute GvHD (7 AML, 5 reduced, 11 others), 10 of them had IL10 C/C genotype (5 AML, 2 reduced, 3 others) and in three patients NOD2 was mutated in donor and/or recipient DNA (1 AML, 2 others). On the other hand, 34 patients with IL10 C/C genotype and 13 patients with NOD2 mutations in donor and/or recipient DNA developed no or mild GvHD only. In conclusion, so far we were not able to find a correlation between GvHD/TRM risks and polymorphisms of IL10, NOD2, and MPO. This might be due to the small number and the heterogeneity of the patients; however, a panel of additional SNPs may increase the accuracy of risk assessment prior to allogeneic SCT. Background. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a curative therapy for patients with lymphoproliferative disorders as a result of the intensity of the conditioning regimen and the application of a graft-versus-lymphoma effect.

The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK) pathway plays a crucial role in pathological events like oxidative stress, inflammation, and abnormal cellular proliferation, resulting in activation of several signalling cascades, involving overexpression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1). TNF-\u03b1 is known to play an important role in chronic rejection. Currently, pharmacological inhibitors of p38-MAPK are being tested clinically for the treatment of Experimentelle Transplantation chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Morbus Crohn and psoriasis as well as inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation after balloon angioplasty. To date, there are no findings that address the role of p38-MAPK in the context of chronic allograft vasculopathy, which is characterized by vascular lesions in the graft that consist of concentric myointimal proliferation, resulting in deterioration of allograft function and organ loss.

CTLA4Ig plays an essential role for tolerance induction in this model but its mechanisms of action does not critically depend on IDO. Background. Induction of antigen-specific tolerance remains the ultimate goal in clinical organ and cell transplantation, as it would eliminate the need for continuous immunosuppression. One strategy leading to tolerance induction against a transplanted organ consists of infusing blood from the organ donor, an approach known as donor-specific transfusion (DST). Although the mechanisms underlying tolerance induction by DST are not fully understood, clonal deletion of alloreactive T cells and generation of immunoregulatory CD25 + CD4 + T cells are important in the process.

As human islet transplantation is limited by the lack of sufficient numbers of human donor organs, xenotransplantation with the use of porcine islet cells seems to be a promising therapeutic option to cure diabetes. In order to achieve sufficient numbers of viable islet cells, better protocols for organ preservation, isolation, and purification are needed.

Within the last years the combination of HPLC (highperformance liquid chromatography) with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) provides an alternative to antibody-based immunoassays. This new analytical method to quantify immunosuppressants affords a robust and rapid separation technique with high selectivity. Up to now, the quantification of wholeblood levels of Cyclosporin A, FK 506 (Tacrolimus), and 42-O-(2-hydroxyethyl)-Rapamycin (Everolimus) at our institute have relied upon three different, indirect assays from different companies. However, these systems have drawbacks caused by cross reactions with active and inactive drug metabolites, fluctuations in assay performance, and comparatively high prices. In contrast, HPLC-MS/MS platforms are now becoming frequently used to measure circulating drug levels and their metabolites with lower associated costs and higher specificity, accuracy, and precision.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "V67 Porcine Inselzelltransplantation in Graz: \u00dcberblick \u00fcber den Stand der Forschung"}, {"text": "Methods. The setup chosen at our laboratories consists of two independent mass spectrometers (one machine at the ZIMCL, a backup machine at BIOCRATES) and allows a sample throughput of about 25 samples per hour.

The faith of an organism that is transmitted by a donor allograft depends on the virulence and the quantity of the transmitted pathogen and the site of infection and furthermore is impacted by prophylactic steps undertaken during donor procurement, organ perfusion, implantation, and post transplant course and lastly depends on the ability of the recipient to control the infection by the immune system. In the best case, the microorganism is cleared before it can do any harm; however, in the worst case scenario, transmitted pathogens can lead to fatality. There is a multitude of pathogens that can potentially be transmitted by an allograft including viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. There are microorganisms that can be transmitted by any type of graft and there are pathogens which due to a certain tropism can be transmitted by certain organs only. There are common pathogens such as CMV and EBV as opposed to extremely rare pathogens such as Lyssa, West Nile fever, or lymphochoriomenigitis virus. Intracellular pathogens are preferably targeted by MHC restricted cytotoxic T-cell reaction. As in organ transplantation HLA matching is in general not performed, donor-derived antigen-presenting cells cannot be recognised by recipient-specific CD8 + lymphocytes. Therefore, either donor-specific cytotoxic T cells must function as counterparts or alternative tar-gets must be defined by the immune system. Bacterial and/or fungal contamination must be considered in lung transplantation (bronchial stump), pancreas transplantation (duodenal segment), and small bowel allografts. Cardiac, renal, and liver grafts can be considered sterile but can become contaminated during procurement.

In another case a preexisting transverse colostomy had to be reinforced. There were 32 cases of Clostridium difficile-associated enterocolitis. Nine patients developed CMV gastrointestinal complications with three cases of colitis, one leading to perforation, intra-abdominal sepsis and death. Two patients developed sigmoid diverticulitis and one appendicitis. Colonic polyps were endoscopically removed in seven patients and three patients were diagnosed with colorectal cancer (one cecal, two rectal cancers), which all were surgically treated. Chronic unexplained diarrhea was observed in fifteen patients, which led to withdrawal of mycophenolic acid. One patient developed a hemorrhage of the terminal ileum/cecal region in the course of intra-abdominal sepsis and was treated by endovascular embolization of the ileocolic artery. Four patients had ongoing ulcerative colitis. One herpetic rectal ulcer and two perianal HSV-associated lesions were diagnosed.

Alle Patienten wurden als kardiale Hochrisikopatienten eingestuft und unter entsprechendem intensivmedizinischen Monitoring postoperativ \u00fcberwacht. Als Vergleichsgruppe zum Studienkollektiv wurden die 488 Patienten ohne dokumentierte koronare Herzerkrankung als Gruppe C definiert. Ergebnisse. In Gruppe A verstarben 4 Patienten (17 %) an kardialer Ursache zwischen dem 6. und 20. p. o. Monat bzw. 3 Patienten an nicht kardialer Ursache und 2 Patienten \u00fcberlebten einen Myokardinfarkt im 1. bzw. 48. p. o. Monat. Insgesamt 3 Transplantate gingen verloren. In Gruppe B verstarben 6 Patienten (25 %) an kardialer Ursache zwischen dem 6. und 84. p. o. Monat und ein Patient \u00fcberlebte einen Myo-kardinfarkt im 103. p. o. Monat. Insgesamt gingen 4 Transplantate verloren. In Gruppe C verstarben insgesamt 64 von 488 Patienten, davon 20 (4,1 %) an kardialer Ursache, 13 an Infektion, 10 an einem Tumorleiden, 8 an einem Schlaganfall und 1 posttraumatisch, 1 an Suizid und 1 nach Aortenruptur. Bei 10 hingegen war die Ursache nicht eruierbar. Die 1-Jahres-Patienten-/Transplantat\u00fcberlebensraten betrugen je 83,3 % in Gruppe A, 95,2/90,4 % in Gruppe B, 96,5/98,1 % in Gruppe C. Die 8-Jahres-Patienten-/Transplantat\u00fcberlebensraten betrugen 37,5/25 % in Gruppe A, je 52,3 % in Gruppe B und 71,3/56,5 % in Gruppe C. Schlussfolgerungen. Trotz pr\u00e4operativer Revaskularisation kam es bei Patienten mit koronarer Herzerkrankung im Langzeitverlauf zu verh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfig vielen kardialen Komplikationen. Das Transplantat\u00fcberleben hingegen ist mit jenem der Patienten ohne koronare Herzerkrankung vergleichbar. Wir schlussfolgern, dass Patienten mit einer revaskularisierten koronaren Herzerkrankung f\u00fcr die Nierentransplantation akzeptiert werden k\u00f6nnen, soweit deren kardiale Funktion den chirurgischen Eingriff erlaubt und ein exaktes postoperatives Monitoring gew\u00e4hrleistet werden kann.

Methodik. W\u00e4hrend der vergangenen 24 Monate entwickelten an unserer Abteilung drei Patienten im Anschluss an eine Nierentransplantation symptomatische Lymphozelen mit Zeichen einer ureteralen Obstruktion. Es wurde jeweils eine supraumbilikale Mini-Laparotomie durchgef\u00fchrt, wobei die Lymphozelenwand mit Hilfe einer 30\u00b0-Optik und unter diaphanoskopischer Verwendung eines starren Kinderurethrozystoskopes inspiziert wurde. Anschlie\u00dfend erfolgte eine Platzierung zweier Arbeitstrokare (einer 5 mm, der andere 10 mm) im Unterbauch kontralateral der Lymphozele. Die Inzision der Lymphozelenwand erfolgte unter Kontrolle des Urethrozystoskopes. Nach Inzision der Lymphozele wurde eine Omentopexie des Schnittrandes durchgef\u00fchrt. Ergebnisse. Eine sonographische Kontrolle am ersten postoperativen Tag ergab in allen F\u00e4llen keine Zeichen einer Fl\u00fcssigkeitsretention. Alle Patienten wurden innerhalb von 48 Stunden nach dem Eingriff aus dem station\u00e4ren Aufenthalt entlassen. Es wurden weder intra-noch postoperative Komplikationen beobachtet. Nach einem Follow-up von 24, 9 und 7 Monaten, wurde kein Lymphozelenrezidiv festgestellt. Schlussfolgerungen. Obwohl auf eine geringe Patientenzahl limitiert, scheint die Methode sowohl die Identifikation der Lymphozelenwand deutlich zu erleichtern als auch postoperative Komplikationen zu minimieren.

In der Therapie des ARDS von Erwachsenen fehlen allgemein akzeptierte Empfehlungen f\u00fcr den Einsatz von ECMO. In der Literatur wird die \u00dcberlebensrate bei Lungenversagen und ECMO-Therapie mit 50 % angegeben. ECMO gilt als Therapie der Wahl bei akutem Rechtsherzversagen nach Herztransplantation. In der Literatur gibt es einzelne Berichte \u00fcber den Einsatz von ECMO bei respiratorischem Versagen nach Lebertransplantation.Methodik. Ein 56 Jahre alter Patient wurde wegen einer alkoholtoxischen Cirrhose lebertransplantiert. Zwei Wochen nach Transplantation entwickelte der Patient unter zunehmenden Zeichen einer generalisierten Sepsis ein ARDS. Eine neuerliche Intubation war notwendig. Trotz maximal invasiver Beatmung kam es zu einer zunehmenden Hypoxie mit sukzessiver Rechtsherzbelastung und Kreislaufinstabilit\u00e4t. Im Status eines schweren protrahierten Schocks wurde eine veno-arterielle ECMO eingesetzt, mit der der Patient stabilisiert werden konnte. In derselben Sitzung wurde bei klinischem Verdacht auf Peritonitis eine Relaperatomie durchgef\u00fchrt. Ein Gallengangsleck mit ausgepr\u00e4gter Peritonitis im Oberbauch wurde diagnostiziert. Ergebnisse. Der Horowitzindex (paO 2 /FiO 2 ) unmittelbar vor ECMO-Implantation war 65, der pulmonalarterielle Druck (PAP) betrug 38/22, der systemische Druck 119/60. An der ECMO kam es sofort zu einer Verbesserung der Oxygenierung und der Kreislaufsituation. Das Galleleck wurde \u00fcbern\u00e4ht. Eine Etappenlavage des Peritoneums wurde eingeleitet. Nach 3 Tagen konnte der Patient nach sukzessiver Verbesserung der respiratorischen Situation problemlos von der ECMO entw\u00f6hnt werden. Die Etappenlavage wurde f\u00fcr insgesamt 7 Tage durchgef\u00fchrt. Aufgrund rekurrenter respiratorischer Probleme wurde ein Tracheostoma angelegt. Dieses konnte zwei Wochen nach ECMO-Therapie entfernt und der Patient auf die Normalstation verlegt werden. Nach weiteren 14 Tagen wurde er gesund nach Hause entlassen. Schlussfolgerungen. In der Therapie des ARDS nach Aussch\u00f6pfung konventioneller M\u00f6glichkeiten hat sich ECMO als erfolgreiches Konzept erwiesen. Peritonitis nach LTX ist eine m\u00f6gliche Ursache f\u00fcr ein akutes respiratorisches Versagen. Ein septisches Zustandsbild gilt heute nicht mehr als Kontraindikation f\u00fcr den Einsatz von ECMO. P07 LTX bei schweren septischen Erkrankungen -Erfahrungen aus Graz an Hand von drei Fallbeispielen E. Jakoby, S. Schaffellner, P. Stiegler, D. Kniepeiss, F. Iberer, KH. Tscheliessnigg Klinische Abteilung f\u00fcr Transplantationschirurgie, Universit\u00e4tsklinik f\u00fcr Chirurgie, Medizinische Universit\u00e4t Graz, Graz, \u00d6sterreich Grundlagen. Eine Sepsis oder die septische Erkrankung eines Organs sind eine strikte Kontraindikationen f\u00fcr eine Lebertransplantation. In Ausnahmef\u00e4llen, insbesondere in Anbetracht des Alters der Patienten, sollte nach genauer Abw\u00e4gung aller Risiken, die LTX trotzdem in Erw\u00e4gung gezogen werden. Methodik. Seit Juli 1998 wurden in Graz 99 Lebertransplantationen bei 95 Patienten in Piggyback-Technik mit retrograder Perfusion und 2 kombinierten LTX-NTX durchgef\u00fchrt. Drei Patienten mit septischer Grunderkrankung und einem Durchschnittsalter von 34,6 Jahren (\u00b16,8) zum Zeitpunkt der LTX wurden in Graz in den letzten 21 Monaten transplantiert. Die Indikation zur LTX war in diesen drei F\u00e4llen eine toxische Leberzirrhose oder ein medikament\u00f6s induziertes Leberversagen. Der Ausgangsherd der septischen Erkrankung und die Erreger waren bekannt, eine suffiziente Antibiose entsprechend dem Antibiogramm vor der LTX eingeleitet und bis zum Abklingen der Symptomatik weitergef\u00fchrt. In einem Fall wurde der Herd operativ saniert. Das immunsupressive Management wurde unter engmaschiger Fermentkontrolle weitgehend reduziert. Die Patienten konnten erst nach einer aufwendigen und intensivierten postoperativen Betreuung im Mittel nach 63,3 Tage (\u00b125,5) in h\u00e4usliche Pflege oder in anschlie\u00dfende Rehabilitation entlassen werden. Bei 2 Patienten kam es zu Komplikationen im Bereich der ableitenden Gallenwegen und der zus\u00e4tzlich nierentransplantierte wurde anf\u00e4nglich \u00fcber die ersten 5 postoperativen Wochen dialysiert. Ergebnisse. Die LTX und kombinierte LTX-NTX wurde bei diesen drei Patienten erfolgreich durchgef\u00fchrt. 2 Patienten sind wieder in den Arbeitsprozess eingegliedert; der 3. Patient befindet sich derzeit in neurologischer Anschlussheilbehandlung, um danach seinen Beruf wieder aufnehmen zu k\u00f6nnen Schlussfolgerungen. Eine LTX, die im Rahmen eines septischen Geschehens notwendig wird, erfordert immer ein individuelles interdisziplin\u00e4res Vorgehen. Wesentlich f\u00fcr einen erfolgreichen Ausgang der Behandlung ist das Zusammentreffen des bestm\u00f6glichen Transplantationszeitpunktes und des Vorhandenseins eines entsprechenden Spenderorgans. Zusammenfassend ist zu erw\u00e4hnen, dass im Einzelfall auch bei septischen Grunderkrankungen eine Organtransplantation in Erw\u00e4gung gezogen werden muss. ent einen bariatrischen Eingriff anstrebte. Das Gewicht zum Zeitpunkt der Operation betrug 132 kg, bei einem BMI von 45 kg/m 2 . Ergebnisse. Die laparoskopische Sleeve Gastrectomy konnte problemlos durchgef\u00fchrt werden. Im Verlauf konnte der Patient einen Excessive Weight Loss von 44 % nach 6 Monaten erzielen. Derzeit h\u00e4lt der Patient nach einem Follow-up von 6 Monaten bei 107 kg. Conclusions. Die laparoskopische Sleeve Gastrectomy stellt eine effektive bariatrische Operationsmethode dar. Auch nach orthotoper Lebertransplantation ist die Durchf\u00fchrung dieser Operation technisch m\u00f6glich. Da es im Gegensatz zum lap. Roux-en-Y-Magenbypass zu keiner Ver\u00e4nderung der Medikamenten-Resorption kommt, ist die laparoskopische Sleeve Gastrectomy auch in Bezug auf die Immunsuppression als eine sichere Operationsmethode anzusehen.

Hinterhuber, I. W. Graziadei Background. Liver transplantation (LT) is the only effective therapy for end-stage liver disease due to hepatitis B (HBV). Before introduction of passive immunoprophylaxis with hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) and new antiviral nucleoside analogues, hepatitis B recurrence was seen in the majority of the patients resulting in an inferior graft survival. In this study we analyzed the different clinical courses of HBV recurrence, the impact of HBV recurrence on patient survival, and potentially contributing factors for long-term outcome of HBV patients after LT.Methods. Between 1983 and 2003, 57 out of 692 patients (50 m, 7 f; mean age, 51 years) were transplanted secondary HBV cirrhosis at our center. The mean follow-up was 44 months (range, 1-246 months). Immunosuppression (IS) consisted of CyA/FK 506, prednisolone and/or azathioprine/MMF. Fourteen patients received no HBIg (prior to 1993), 14 patients received HBIg alone, and 29 patients HBIg in combination with Lamivudine (LAM).Results. The actuarial overall 1-, 5-, 10-year survival rates were 83%, 69%, and 65%, comparable to those of other indications. Patients with combined prophylaxis showed the best survival rates (88%, 77%, 77%), compared to patients treated with HBIg (82%, 51%, 51%) and patients without treatment (76%, 70%, 63%). Five patients required ReLTx, one patient two ReLTx. In total, 17 patients (33.5%) developed recurrent HBV infection after LT: 50% (6 of 12) in the non-HBIg group, 42% (6 of 14) in the HBIg mono, and 18% (5 of 28) in the combined prophylaxis group. Four of the five patients in the HBIg/LAM group were HBV DNA positive prior to LT, two presented with LAM mutants. HBV recurrence, however, did not negatively impact patient outcome. All patients with recurrent disease were treated with antivirals (Famcyclovir, LAM, Adefovir). Forty-seven percent of patients responded to the treatment and remained HBV DNA negative. Only one patient was retransplantated due to HBV recurrence. No possible risk factors for overall survival were found to be significant.Conclusions. Our study showed that patients with combined HBIg/LAM prophylaxis had excellent long-term survival. Recurrent HBV in the allograft could be effectively treated in the majority of patients and did not influence longterm survival. Background. Liver failure is associated with reduced synthesis of clotting factors, consumptive coagulopathy, and platelet dysfunction. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of liver support using the molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS) on the coagulation system in patients at high risk of bleeding.Methods. 61 MARS treatments in 33 patients with acute liver failure (n = 15), acute on chronic liver failure (n = 8), sepsis (n = 5), liver graft dysfunction (n = 3), and cholestasis (n = 2) have been studied. Standard coagulation tests, standard thromboelastography (TEG), heparinase-modified and abciximab-fab-modified TEG were performed immediately before and 30 minutes after commencement of MARS and after the end of MARS treatment. To all patients, prostaglandin I2 was administered extracorporeally. 17 patients additionally received unfractioned heparin.Results. Three moderate bleeding complications in three patients, requiring 3-4 units of packed red blood cells, were observed. All were sufficiently managed without interrupting MARS treatment. Although there was a significant decrease in platelet counts (median, 9 G/l; range, -40 to 145 G/l) and fibrinogen concentration (median, 15 mg/dl; range, -119 to 185 mg/dl) with a consecutive increase in thrombin time, the platelet function, as assessed by abciximab-fab-modified TEG, remained stable. MARS did not enhance fibrinolysis.Conclusions. MARS treatment appears to be well tolerated in patients with marked coagulopathy due to liver failure. Although MARS leads to a further decrease in platelet count and fibrinogen concentration, platelet function, measured as contribution of the platelets to the clot firmness in TEG, remains stable. According to TEG-based results, MARS does not enhance fibrinolysis. Methodik.
