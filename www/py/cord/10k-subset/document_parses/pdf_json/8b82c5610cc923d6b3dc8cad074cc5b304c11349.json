We investigated a strategy in which CB units should contain at least 2 \u00c2 10 7 total nucleated cells/kg of recipient weight, otherwise a second unit had to be added. We report the results of a study that was prematurely closed owing to toxicity. Patients with advanced hematologic malignancies without a human leukocyte antigen-matched sibling or unrelated donor were eligible. Conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine and 12 Gy of total body irradiation (n \u00bc 11), or melphalan (n \u00bc 4), with antithymocyte globulin. Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis was tacrolimus and methotrexate. Fifteen patients with acute leukemia (n \u00bc 9), chronic myelogenous leukemia (n \u00bc 2), multiple myeloma (n \u00bc 2) and lymphoma (n \u00bc 2) were treated; 60% had relapsed disease at transplantation. Three patients received double CB transplants. The 100day and 1-year treatment-related mortality rates were 40 and 53%, respectively. Median time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment was 22 days (n \u00bc 10) and 37 days (n \u00bc 10), respectively. One patient had secondary graft failure and five patients failed to engraft. Two patients are alive and disease free; 4-year actuarial survival is 33 versus 0% for patients transplanted in remission versus in relapse. We concluded that disease status was the main determinant of treatment failure in this study.",

Furthermore, delays intrinsic to the search process may impact decidedly in the outcome of transplantation for diseases at high risk of relapse or progression. Using mismatched unrelated donors may increase the donor pool, but this type of transplant carries a high risk of graftversus-host disease (GVHD) and severely impaired immune recovery.",

The most important variable was disease status at transplantation, associated with extensive prior treatment and poor tolerance to transplant-associated toxicities, factors that likely increased TRM. Here, selection of relatively large CB units with a median total infused nucleated cell count/kg of 3.2 \u00c2 10 7 did not impact early mortality, as observed in other series. 10, 11 Use of CB units containing TNC doses below 1-1.5 \u00c2 10 7 is associated with high rates of engraftment failure, and accordingly, we attempted combination of units in three cases in order to optimize the cell dose. Despite our approach, we observed a high rate of primary engraftment failure. It is possible that a diagnosis of CML was an added risk factor in two of our cases as it has been suggested. 11 In the multicenter Cord Blood Transplantation (COBLT) study, 34% of the adult patients failed to achieve donor hematopoiesis. 12 Comparisons of published results are sometimes difficult to perform given that definitions of engraftment failure differ in the literature, but it is commonly accepted that lack of neutrophil recovery by day 42 indicates a very low likelihood of success. The competing risk of death before engraftment is frequently not taken into consideration, an approach that makes the interpretation of the data very difficult and subject to biases.",

Such degree of donorrecipient mismatch is now a well-known risk factor for poor survival. 11 Three patients were so treated (combined with another unit in one instance). Therefore, the degree of matching contributed to the poor results. Another potential criticism is our GVHD prophylaxis that employed 'mini' methotrexate. There is evidence that this drug may contribute to excess mortality, at least when used in higher doses than the ones employed here. Interestingly, the combination of tacrolimus and mini-methotrexate has been used without excessive toxicity in the pediatric setting. 16 Fludarabine and melphalan was the preparative regimen in four cases. One patient engrafted, whereas three patients did not. In light of these results, we cannot recommend the use of this regimen in this setting. Other groups have however reported improved results using a reducedintensity approach to reduce TRM. 17, 18 High-dose ATG was part of our conditioning regimens, but its use to improve engraftment and possibly decrease the incidence of GVHD is controversial. This drug has been reported to delay immune recovery, and we are currently using significantly reduced doses. 19 Only three of our nine engrafted patients developed acute GVHD without visceral involvement, whereas one patient died of chronic GVHD. Again, the competing risk of early mortality owing to infections and toxicity makes this low rate difficult to interpret. In the COBLT study, GVHD was the leading cause of death. 12 How can these results be improved? Cell dose is critical. It is unclear, however, if doubling the cell dose by combining two units, for example, will be enough to improve outcomes. At this point, there are no controlled studies comparing double versus single CB transplants. Another approach that we are currently investigating involves ex vivo expansion of CB progenitor cells, in an attempt to circumvent cell dose-related problems. [20] [21] [22] CB carries the potential to extend hematopoietic transplantation to a variety of patients otherwise not eligible for this form of treatment. However, our results would indicate that high-risk patients have an increased probability of TRM even with the use of units containing higher TNC counts, and that treatment of relapsed patients should only be pursued under controlled clinical trials.
