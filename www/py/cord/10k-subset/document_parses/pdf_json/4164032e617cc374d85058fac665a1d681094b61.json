In this interferon test-system, direct contact of the inhibitor with the test virus is excluded and the antiviral action is effected indirectly through the metabolism of the target cell [18] . The facts given above permit the protein isolated to be called an \"interferon-like viral inhibitor.\" In contrast to the interferon synthesized inducibly in response to the action of a virus of an inductor, we have isolated this inhibitor from various sera and plasmas of the blood of healthy human donors regardless of blood group with practically the same yield -3.5 \u00b1 0.7 ~g from I ml. One more difference of the serum proteins from the interferons is in their specific activities: for interferons the specific antiviral activity is 2-4\"109 units per 1 mg, and for the inhibitor that we have isolated it is-l-2.10 s units per 1 mg.
