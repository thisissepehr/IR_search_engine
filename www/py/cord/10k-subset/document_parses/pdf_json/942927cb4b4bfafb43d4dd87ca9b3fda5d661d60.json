In particular, highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 has spread across Asia, Africa, and Europe, leading to the deaths of millions of poultry and hundreds of people. The two main means of international spread are through migratory birds and the live poultry trade. We focus on the role played by the live poultry trade in the spread of H5N1 across three regions widely infected by the disease, which also correspond to three major trade blocs: the European Union (EU), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Across all three regions, we found per-capita GDP (a proxy for modernization, general biosecurity, and value-at-risk) to be risk reducing. A more specific biosecurity measure-general surveillance-was also found to be mitigating at the all-regions level. However, there were important inter-regional differences. For the EU and ASEAN, intra-bloc live poultry imports were risk reducing while extra-bloc imports were risk increasing; for ECOWAS the reverse was true. This is likely due to the fact that while the EU and ASEAN have long-standing biosecurity standards and stringent enforcement (pursuant to the World Trade Organization's Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures), ECOWAS suffered from a lack of uniform standards and lax enforcement.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Citation: Wu T, Perrings C (2018) The live poultry trade and the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza: Regional differences between Europe, West Africa, and Southeast Asia.

The H5N1panzootic (2004 ongoing) has been one the most geographically widespread and costly, resulting in the loss of hundreds of millions of poultry in 68 countries [1] and over 450 human deaths worldwide-a mortality rate of 60 percent [2, 3] . For H5N1, and other H5 subtypes, most countries reporting poultry outbreaks also report evidence of the disease in wild bird populations, and the mechanisms for the spread of H5N1 have been identified as a combination of wild bird transmission and the live poultry trade [4, 5] . PLOS risk factors. Our primary interest is in the role of live poultry imports as a source of traderelated avian influenza risk at the regional level. We note that other poultry products, such as packaged meat and eggs, do pose a risk, but it is significantly lower. Although avian influenza can persist in frozen meat, contact with that meat is unlikely to cause infection [30] . Furthermore, since HPAIs are lethal to egg embryos, eggs are not a potential source of transmission [31] . The data comprise an unbalanced panel covering 53 countries over 13 years; the lack of balance is due to the fact that membership of the EU changed over the timeframe. The response variable in all models estimated was a log transformation of the number of H5N1 poultry outbreaks in a given country in a given year, obtained from the Emergency Prevention System for Animal Health (EMPRES), a joint project of the FAO and OIE [32] . The log transformation was applied to account for the wide disparities in the numbers of the outbreaks across countries. In 2010, for example, Indonesia recorded 1206 outbreaks while Romania, the only EU country to be infected that year, had only 2. In addition to reflecting the differing directions and intensities of risk factors, this also reflects differences in reporting conventions for H5N1 at the international level [33] .

We adopted both random and fixed effects estimators. Hausman tests conducted at the all-regions level favored a random effects estimator, as the p-value exceeded the 5% threshold below which fixed-effects regression is conventionally considered necessary. Some factors that influence the likelihood and number of outbreaks in a given country or region are not likely to change significantly over the course of several years, or even a decade. In our dataset, Netherlands for example, the amount of land covered by wild bird habitat is time-variant, while agricultural land and even per-capita GDP for many countries experienced relatively modest variations over the timeframe of the study. In this case, and as the Hausman diagnostics indicate, a random effects estimator is more appropriate. Nevertheless, since we wished to control for timeinvariant characteristics of regions and countries we also implemented fixed effects estimators at both the aggregate and trading bloc levels, implicitly assuming no changes in the trade or biosecurity environment at the bloc level that we are unable to control for. Our first specification (Model 1) included a number of factors related to disease risk but excluded both live poultry imports and biosecurity measures. Included predictors were land area, human population, per-capita GDP in purchasing power terms, agricultural area, wild bird habitat area, and the live chicken population. Our second specification (Model 2) added intra-regional trade bloc and extra-bloc imports of live poultry.

Finally, since the data used in this analysis are reported annually, and H5N1 has been a conspicuous and fast-moving epidemic (meaning the effects of an outbreak are unlikely to persist over a long period of time) among poultry, we did not use a lag structure in our statistical analysis. Therefore, we assumed that the factors driving an outbreak in a given year are contemporaneous with it (e.g., an outbreak that occurred in 2012 were modelled using trade volumes from 2012).

Our concern here has been to identify the nature of the risk posed by the live poultry trade in different regions of the world, and the conditions affecting that risk. Our measure of development status, per-capita GDP, is simultaneously a proxy for modernization, biosecurity, consumption, and value-at-risk. As a proxy for modernization, it reflects risk-reducing differences in production methods. Industrial livestock production methods typically include on-farm biosecurity measures that protect poultry from contact with disease-carrying wild birds. Unlike traditional methods of free-range or \"backyard\" husbandry, factory production minimizes the likelihood of poultry intermingling with wild birds or being exposed to environmental pathogen pollution. For all its epidemiological, ecological, and ethical problems, industrial livestock production allows for more timely and widespread disease surveillance and vaccination, and for greater compliance with animal health regulations [48] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1237, "end": 1241, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "At the same time, per-capita GDP growth is also associated with risk-increasing changes in meat consumption, and hence poultry production.

Amongst the landscape variables-land area, the proportion in agriculture, and the proportion in IBAs-our results reveal no uniform relation to H5N1 outbreaks. At the all-regions level we found a weakly negative relation between outbreaks and the proportion of the land area in IBAs (Table 1 ). This was driven by the European Union, which includes the highest proportion of land area in IBAs, but also the most industrialized forms of poultry production. The degree to which poultry production is industrialized also shows up in the coefficients on poultry numbers, which are negative and significant only for the EU (Table 4 ). While spatial heterogeneity at the landscape scale is important in terms of avian ecology, we were unable to take explicit account of these more detailed considerations in a country-scale analysis.

This is also what our study finds for the ASEAN region (Table 2) . We do not see an equivalent effect for the EU (Table 4 ), reflecting differences in both import volumes and the biosecurity measures applied to imports. The EU imports less and applies stricter biosecurity measures to those imports. The ECOWAS story is different. Extra-bloc live poultry imports are risk reducing, not risk increasing (Table 3 ). It is likely that imports from outside the bloc reduce avian influenza risk in the region in part because they meet biosecurity standards that are more stringent than the standards applied in the region. The effects of intra-bloc trade in live poultry mirror the effects of extra-bloc trade. In the EU and ASEAN, intra-bloc trade is risk reducing (Tables 2 and 4 ). This may reflect a \"substitution effect\" in which imports of safer intra-bloc poultry crowds out riskier extra-bloc imports. Other studies have come to similar conclusions. EU-derived live poultry imports to Spain, for example, were found to pose no threat of avian influenza introduction [52] . Once again, ECO-WAS is the exception. Extra-ECOWAS imports of live poultry are risk reducing while intrabloc imports are risk increasing (Table 2 ). This is likely due to poor internal biosecurity, such as lax standards and inconsistent execution of inspections.

Our results suggest that after introduction, inter-country spread had differing dynamics in each region.

In particular, HPAI H5N1, which was first isolated in 1996, has been the most widespread and among the most devastating in terms of livestock and human mortality. It has inflicted severe losses to poultry stocks and caused hundreds of human deaths. Even today, as other avian influenzas have become epidemic, H5N1 remains in circulation among wildlife and livestock. Identifying and quantifying the mechanisms of its international spread can help lay the groundwork for prediction and mitigation.

Differing agro-ecological and socioeconomic conditions across the trade regions were shown to influence epidemic dynamics in different ways, with certain factors being risk-enhancing or risk-decreasing in one region but having the opposite effect, or no significant effect, in another. In policy terms, there is no one-size-fits-all solution to mitigating avian influenza spread. The particular conditions, including those related to the trade agreements and associated regulatory standards, of a given region need to be carefully considered. But overall, biosecurity measures are potentially effective at controlling H5N1 risks, and should be undertaken as a means to forestall spread-in general, mitigation of epidemics is significantly more cost-efficient than suppression [57] . On-farm and other forms of domestic biosecurity may be more important than trade-related measures, but where the protection of trade pathways is weak, the risk of avian influenza spread is clearly higher.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 915, "end": 919, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "Supporting information S1 File.
