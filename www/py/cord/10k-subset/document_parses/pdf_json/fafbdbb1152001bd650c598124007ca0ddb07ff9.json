Informal discussions with many academics suggest that about 50 per cent had some consultancy work in their career, bringing in a total of \u00a35,000-10,000 each, and some can double their salary from consultancy.

This could be recognised leadership in a field of knowledge, a specific experimental model, specific expertise in a new field etc. Such leading expertise is likely to take time to acquire, and to be time limited.

Both are extremely poor rewards on a per hour basis compared with consultancy. These conclusions apply only to the specific economic models studied.
