            "text": "Ebola virus (EBOV) is a negative sense, single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus capable of causing severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates (NHPs). Until 2013, EBOV was responsible for approximately 1600 deaths; however, the most recent outbreak in Western Africa (Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia), leading to eventual spread to Europe and the United States, resulted in over 28 600 cases and 11 300 deaths as of April 2016 [1, 2] . The progression of EBOV disease (EVD) within infected individuals involves nonspecific influenza-like symptoms, cytokine storm, and potential hemorrhagic manifestations including coagulopathy, leaky blood vessels, and multiorgan failure. Ebola virus mainly targets host cells of the myeloid lineage (monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells), but it does not productively infect T cells. Despite this targeting, lethal infections are accompanied by extensive cell death of CD4 and CD8 T-lymphocytes [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . There are several proposed mechanisms for the induction of apoptosis in bystander lymphocytes during EBOV pathogenesis, including the following: Fas/Fas ligand and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) interactions, impaired dendritic cell/T-cell contacts, and nitric oxide or viral glycoprotein (GP)-induced apoptosis [5, [9] [10] [11] . Likewise, we have recently proposed an additional potential mechanism for the induction of bystander T-cell death in the form of the EBOV matrix protein transferred to recipient cells via exosomes [12, 13] . However, the extent to which each of these mechanisms may contribute to bystander lymphocyte apoptosis and EBOV pathogenesis is not well characterized. Nevertheless, the loss of circulating T-cell populations in infected individuals may contribute to unchecked replication of the virus, potentially correlating with poor patient prognosis [13, 14] .",

Various specific tetraspanin proteins such as CD63, CD81, and CD9 mark the surface of exosomes and can be used to distinguish them from other EVs [19] . The content of exosomes can vary based upon cell type and environment; however, the selective packaging of cargo into exosomes is largely regulated by the Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport (ESCRT) proteins. The ESCRT proteins can be classified as ESCRT-I, -II, -III complex components and VPS4, which sequentially act to recognize cargo, package it into nascent vesicles, and pinch off the membrane while recycling the machinery back for future cargo packaging [20] . During infection, various viral proteins and nucleic acids can become integrated into exosomes, often by utilizing the ESCRT pathway [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Exosomes originating from infected cells can then induce proviral effects in recipient cells [12, 13, 16, 17, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] .",

Microvesicles do not contain tetraspanins CD9 or CD81, and they have a similar lipid composition as the plasma membrane from which they budd [28, 29, 32] . Apoptotic bodies, unlike the other secreted vesicles, are formed only during programmed cell death.

Recently, we found the first evidence that VP40 is also able to exit cells by becoming packaged into exosomes [12, 13] . This finding is consistent with previous studies that have shown filoviral VP40 concentrating in late endosomal compartments and multivesicular exosomal bodies [42, 43] . Another study by Steele et al [44] showed that in EBOV-infected NHP and guinea pig models, VP40 antigen alone is concentrated in renal tubule epithelial cells, indicating that VP40 can exist outside of the virion (ie, potentially in exosomes) [45] .",

We have found that VP40 was able to affect cell cycle through cyclin D1 (which binds to cdk4 or cdk6) modulation to regulate the synthesis of EVs in donor cells. This regulation was done by the translocation of VP40 into the nucleus to stimulate overtranscription of cyclin D1 at its promoter, thus producing an activated phenotype in VP40-producing cells. We tested the efficacy of cdk4/6 inhibitors for their ability to hinder donor cell EV production and found that Fascaplysin and Ribociclib (Ribociclib is US Food and Drug Administration [FDA]approved) may impact the biogenesis of EVs. In previous studies, we showed that VP40 was secreted in exosomes [12, 13] , and here we additionally found that VP40 and other viral proteins (ie, NP and GP) were associated with EVs from wild-type EBOV-infected cells and macaques. Finally, mass spectrometry (MS) and cytokine analysis showed that exosomes originating from VP40-producing cells were enriched in several RNAbinding proteins and cytokines, which may play a pivotal role in recipient cell outcome.",

For the experiments used here, 293T cells and VP40 clones were grown in exosome-free DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS (ultracentrifuged at 100 000 \u00d7g for 90 minutes to remove vesicles), 1% l-glutamine, and 1% streptomycin/penicillin (Quality Biological). Exosome preparations were made from exosome-free cell culture supernatant (filtered; 0.22 \u03bcm) produced from fully confluent cells grown for 5 days. For isolation of exosomes for western blot analysis and AChE assay, NT80/82 particles were used as described above. For the characterization of exosomes by gradient separation and western blot, 10 mL of unfiltered cell culture supernatant was incubated with 10 mL of ExoMAX Opti Enhancer at 4\u00b0C overnight. The vesicle pellet was spun down at 1500 \u00d7g for 30 minutes and resuspended in 300 \u03bcL sterile 1\u00d7 PBS without calcium or magnesium. Resuspended vesicles were then placed on top of iodixanol (OptiPrep; Sigma) gradients prepared in 1\u00d7 PBS in 1.2% increments ranging from 6% to 18%. The gradient was ultracentrifuged for 90 minutes at 100 000 \u00d7g in a SW41 Ti rotor (Beckman). Gradient fractions were collected from the top of the gradient in 1-mL increments and transferred to sterile 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tubes. Separated iodixanol fractions were incubated with 30 \u03bcL of NT80/82 30% slurry at 4\u00b0C overnight, followed by processing for western blot or MS analysis. Alternatively, select iodixanol fractions were pooled and resuspended in sterile 1\u00d7 PBS, followed by ultracentrifugation for 90 minutes at 100 000 \u00d7g in a Ti-70 rotor (Beckman) to pellet EVs for the removal of iodixanol for downstream functional assays. Direct isolation of EVs from small volumes of cell-free supernatants from 293T and V2CH cells (grown in exosome-free media) was completed by ultracentrifugation for 90 minutes at 100 000 \u00d7g in a TL-100 rotor (Beckman). Resulting EV pellets were resuspended in 40 \u03bcL of sterile 1\u00d7 PBS and used for ZetaView analysis and subsequent functional assays.",

            "text": "In the process of generating these clones, we observed a notably accelerated growth in cells producing VP40 (data not shown). It is well documented for many viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), human cytomegalovirus, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human papillomaviruses (HPVs), Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, adenoviruses, influenza viruses, and infectious bronchitis virus, that infected cells are altered in their cell cycle to benefit viral replication [53] [54] [55] [56] . Therefore, we asked whether a similar phenotype occurred within VP40 clones. To address this question, we blocked control 293T, V2CL, and V2CH cells at the G 0 , G 1 /S, and G 2 /M stages of the cell cycle for either 2 or 5 days to observe changes in cell morphology and viability ( Figure 1 ). Data in Figure 1A show that after 2 days of cell cycle blocks, all cell types had the expected morphology with minimal cell death. More specifically, G 0 cells appeared adherent and stretched, G 1 /S cells were adherent and enlarged, whereas G 2 /M cells were smaller and rounded. Results from the corresponding 2-day cell viability assay ( Figure 1B ) indicated that all blocked cells had reduced viability, as would also be expected with functioning cell cycle blocks. After 5 days, a different pattern between cell types was observed. Control 293T cells retained similar phenotypes at 5 days compared with 2 days. However, it should be noted that significant cell death was observed for 293T cells at both G 1 /S and G 2 /M after 5 days ( Figure 1C and D). In contrast, VP40 donor cells expressed greater cell viability at G 1 /S and G 2 /M, in line with increasing amounts of VP40 produced ( Figure 1D ). Strikingly, with increased levels of VP40 produced, V2C cells adhered less to the expected phenotype exhibited by 293T cells. At G 0 after 5 days, V2C cells were more viable compared with 293T cells and had clumped together to form structures that closely resembled viral synapses ( Figure 1C ), similar to those seen with viruses such as HIV-1, Japanese encephalitis virus, influenza A virus, and HTLV-1 [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] . It is possible that these clumped structures may represent a potential synaptic mechanism used by EBOV in epithelial cell infection when nutrients are depleted and cell cycling is hindered. In addition, V2C cells at G 1 /S and G 2 /M continued to \"slip through\" cell cycle blocks, especially in V2CH cells, as demonstrated by many rounded cells (G 2 /M) present in G 1 /S-blocked cultures and many adherent cells (G 1 /S) in G 2 /M-blocked cultures ( Figure 1C ). This pattern was further demonstrated by an increase in cell viability of V2C cells compared with 293T at G 1 /S and G 2 /M ( Figure 1D ). Finally, regardless of the length of incubation, there was a VP40 production level-dependent increase in the number and viability of V2C control cells compared with 293T, supporting our previous observation of an increased growth rate in VP40-producing cells. Taken together, these results indicate that cells producing VP40 may have accelerated rates of growth directly proportional to the amount of VP40 being produced. Furthermore, VP40-producing cells may potentially be able to push past cell cycle blocks imposed by external or internal influences, indicating a dysregulation of cell cycle checkpoints and resulting in increased survival under various environmental stresses.",

            "text": "As V2C cells had been observed to have accelerated growth, we next explored the effect of VP40 production on levels of cyclin and cdk proteins. Western blot analysis of cyclin and cdk levels in 293T, V2CL, V2CI, and V2CH cells showed that levels of cdk1 increased in all V2C cells, whereas cdk2, -4, -6, and cyclin E showed only a small upregulation with increasing VP40 produced ( Figure 2A ). Cyclins A and B1 were initially increased with low levels of VP40 but then decreased in a dose-dependent manner with increasing levels of VP40 produced. On the other hand, cyclin D1 increased in a VP40 dose-dependent manner. Increased levels of cyclin D1 have previously been shown to result in accelerated cell cycling and many types of oncogenic phenotypes [62] [63] [64] . In addition, several viruses, including HTLV-1, HPV, EBV, human neurotropic JC virus, and human respiratory syncytial virus, have previously been shown to influence the levels of cyclin D in infected cells to aid in their viral life cycle [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] . Cyclin D1's primary role during cell cycle is to bind to its cdk partner(s), cdk4 or cdk6, to activate its kinase activity, and thereby phosphorylate its substrate Rb to induce cell cycle progression from G 1 to S phase [62] . Therefore, we investigated the ability of cyclin D1 from V2C cells to initiate phosphorylation of its substrate Rb at the Serine-780 residue. Two 13-mer peptides were generated: one 780S peptide mapping to a cyclin D1/cdk4 phosphorylation site of Rb, and one 780A peptide (S780A point mutation) [71] . Control 293T and V2CH whole-cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with \u03b1-cyclin D1 or IgG. Precipitated complexes were incubated with either 780S or 780A peptide, and some were incubated with Fascaplysin (cdk4/6 inhibitor). In vitro kinase assays were then performed using [\u03b3-32 P] ATP. Results in Figure 2B show that in 293T cells, active cyclin D1 complexes phosphorylated the 780S peptide as expected, whereas the 780A peptide and the 780S peptide incubated with Fascaplysin had only minimal background levels of phosphorylation. It is interesting to note that V2CH cells had an increased level of phosphorylation of 780S by IPed cyclin D1 compared with 293T cells. Moreover, incubation with Fascaplysin did not completely ameliorate the cyclin D1 activity on the 780S peptide. Taken together, these results indicate that cyclin D1 has a higher level of activity in V2CH cells compared with 293T cells, and that inhibition of active cyclin D1/cdk4/6 complexes in V2CH cells by Fascaplysin is less effective. This finding could perhaps be due to an overall greater amount of cyclin D1 present in V2CH cells, and therefore a higher concentration of Fascaplysin may be needed to prevent kinase activity.",

            "text": "Based upon our observations of accelerated growth and increased levels of cyclin D1 in cells producing VP40, we next wished to investigate potential factors contributing to cyclin D1 transcription. Previous studies have shown the intriguing presence of EBOV VP40 within the nucleus, especially at early time points in infection [72] [73] [74] . To confirm VP40 presence in the nuclear compartment of our VP40 clones, cytoplasm and nuclear fractions of 293T and V2CH cells were isolated by NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction kit. CHMP6 (cytoplasmic protein; ESCRT-III component) and HDAC1 (nuclear protein involved in chromatin remodeling) were used as controls for cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, respectively. Actin was also used to measure even loading of samples, because Actin has been shown to be abundantly present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus [75, 76] . Results in Figure 2C show that VP40 protein was present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of V2CH cells. We were surprised to find that the levels of VP40 in the nuclear fraction were nearly equivalent with those seen in the cytoplasmic compartment, representing a much higher proportion of nuclear VP40 than we had anticipated. Therefore, we hypothesized that VP40 may potentially act as a transcription factor for the cyclin D1 promoter to elicit increased levels of cyclin D1, thereby accelerating the growth of host cells. RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) is found on the promoters of actively transcribed genes, and p300 has previously been shown to be involved in the activation of transcription of cyclin D1 and other mitogen-induced genes involved in cell growth and differentiation [77, 78] . Along these lines, to ascertain whether Pol II, p300, or VP40 were potentially involved CycD1 \u03b1-CycD1",

(D) Log phase 293T and V2CH cells (3 \u00d7 10 6 ) were harvested and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 1 hour followed by quenching with 1.25 glycine (9:1 cell suspension/glycine). Samples were sonicated, and 100 \u00b5L of each sample (corresponding to approximately 5 \u00d7 10 5 cells) was used for IP with 1 \u00b5g of anti-Pol II, \u03b1-p300, or \u03b1-VP40 at 4\u00b0C overnight. The next day, Protein A/G (30% slurry) was added and incubated for 2 hours at 4\u00b0C. Complexes were washed once with each TNE300 + 0.1% NP40, TNE150 + 0.1% NP40, TNE50 + 0.1% NP40, and IP wash buffer before the addition of proteinase K (800 units/mL). Samples were incubated for 15 minutes at 65\u00b0C, reversing solution was added, and samples were incubated for an additional 90 minutes at 65\u00b0C. DNA was purified, and qPCR was performed with 2 \u03bcL of undiluted DNA with primers for the CycD1 promoter region (spanning \u2212180 to +238 from the messenger RNA start site at +1). The absolute quantification of the samples was determined based on the cycle threshold value relative to the standard curve generated from serial dilutions of DNA from 293T cells. Data are presented as percentage (%) of the input (DNA purified from sonicated samples before IP with specific antibodies). Student's 2-tailed t test compares V2CH ChIPed DNA with corresponding 293T ChIP samples (**, P < .01).",

Data in Figure 2D show that in 293T cells, background levels of Pol II, p300, and VP40 were <3% of the DNA input (2.8%, 2.6%, and 2.7%, respectively). The background levels of these, particularly VP40, may be partially attributed to nonspecific binding of proteins during the IP procedure during ChIP. Interestingly, Pol II on the cyclin D1 promoter more than doubled to 5.9%, whereas p300 increased more than 4-fold to 11.11% of DNA input in V2CH cells. Even more surprising, VP40 was present on the cyclin D1 promoter in V2CH cells at an astounding 38.4% of DNA input. Collectively, these data suggest that VP40, Pol II, and p300 are present at elevated levels on the cyclin D1 promoter in cells producing VP40, which may result in the upregulated transcription of cyclin D1. This in turn may be responsible for the accelerated cell cycling of VP40-producing cells. Additional consequences of this abundance of nuclear VP40 are likely, which should be the focus of future studies.",

            "text": "We previously showed that exosomes from V2CL cells are enriched in specific markers CD63 and Alix, whereas donor cells contain higher levels of ESCRT proteins [12, 13] . Therefore, we asked whether the altered cell cycle dynamics in VP40 donor cells could impact EV production. Control 293T and V2CL cells were blocked at G 0 , G 1 /S, and G 2 /M stages of the cell cycle and analyzed for levels of ESCRT proteins and exosomal markers ( Figure 4A ). Side-by-side analyses of EV contents and AChE activity of the exosomes produced from cell cycle blocked cells were likewise performed ( Figure 4B and C). Data in Figure 4A show that, interestingly, unsynchronized control V2CL cells had drastic differences in ESCRT protein levels compared with control 293T cells ( Figure 4A , compare lane 5 vs 1). Consistent with our previous findings [12] , levels of TSG101 and Alix were also increased in unsynchronized V2CL cells. In addition, V2CL cells had a greater abundance of a modified form of EAP45 (EAP45 B) and glycosylated CD63 when unsynchronized. Moreover, control V2CL cells contained a distinct pattern of VPS4 bands between 50 and 70 kDa (VPS4A-C) that resembled 293T cells at the G 1 /S or G 2 /M phases. The functional significance of these larger forms of EAP45 and VPS4 is currently uncertain. Changes at G 0 were also present, with increased levels of TSG101, CHMP6, EAP20, Alix, and CD63 in V2CL compared with 293T cells ( Figure 4A , compare lanes 6 vs 2). Changes between 293T and V2CL cells at G 1 /S or G 2 /M phases were less drastic with only minor differences. Collectively, these data indicate that V2CL cells may have a different cell cycle dynamic compared with 293T control cells, particularly at G 0 , resulting in altered patterns of ESCRT proteins and exosomal markers. Analysis of exosomal markers from cell cycle-blocked V2CL cell EVs revealed an increase in all forms of CD63 at G 0 compared with 293T cells ( Figure 4B ). When testing for AChE activity (indicative of exosomal abundance), the total number of exosomes from unsynchronized (control) 293T vs V2CL cells was not significantly different ( Figure 4C ). However, it was interesting to note that at G 0 , the number of exosomes was reduced by >1 log compared with unsynchronized control exosomes for both cell types. This finding was corroborated by the distinct reduction of most ESCRT ( Figure 4A) and exosomal proteins at G 0 compared with levels at G 1 /S and G 2 /M phases ( Figure 4A and B). Both cell types had similar levels of exosomes produced when blocked at G 1 /S compared with unsynchronized (control) cells; however, V2CL cells produced significantly more exosomes at G 2 /M compared with control, whereas 293T cells did not. In addition, V2CL cells produced significantly fewer exosomes at G 0 and at G 1 /S phases compared with 293T cells at the same phases ( Figure 4C ). Together, these results suggest that exosomes and EVs are produced in a cell cycle-dependent manner, with cells at G 0 phase producing significantly fewer vesicles. Moreover, cells producing VP40 may have an altered pattern of cell cycle-driven exosomal production, as demonstrated by differential patterns of ESCRT and exosomal marker protein expression.",

            "text": "Next, we wished to more closely examine the effects of cell cycle blocks on EV production in cells producing VP40 at low and high levels. 293T, V2CL, and V2CH cells were blocked at G 0 , G 1 /S, and G 2 /M phases for 5 days, followed by harvesting of the cell culture supernatants, filtration (through 0.22 \u03bcm), and analysis of the resulting EVs by ZetaView. Data in Figure 5A display the peak diameter size (mode) of vesicles released. V2CL cells had significantly larger vesicles produced at G 0 compared with 293T cells, whereas V2CH cells had larger EVs when not only blocked at G 1 /S and G 2 /M phases, but also in untreated cultures when compared with 293T cells. In addition, larger vesicles were produced from all 3 cell types at G 0 in comparison with untreated controls, although this difference was not consistently significant. The overall trend regarding EV concentration was that vesicles from V2C cells decreased in number in a VP40 level-dependent manner when compared against 293T cell groups ( Figure 5B ). Furthermore, amongst all cell types, the number of EVs present at G 0 phase were significantly reduced from unsynchronized (control) cultures. This finding supports our earlier conclusions that exosomes may be produced at lower levels when cells are resting at G 0 ( Figure 4B and C). It should be noted that ZetaView analysis detects the total number of vesicles or large particles present, with exosomes comprising only a fraction of these. Therefore, to determine the distribution of true exosomes containing VP40, we used our previously published strategy of exosome characterization by density gradient ultracentrifugation [50] . Through this methodology, we have shown that it is possible to clearly separate out exosomes from potentially contaminating viral particles, thus making more detailed characterizations of specific EV populations possible. Here, we grew control 293T and V2CI cells for 5 days, harvested the supernatants, and incubated the unfiltered supernatants in ExoMAX, followed by separation of resulting extracellular material through iodixanol density gradient fractionation. Fractions were subjected to western blot analysis for exosomal marker proteins and VP40. Results in Figure 6A show that in 293T cells, CD63 + CD9 + CD81 + (exosome) fractions fell into 3 distinct categories. First, fractions 8.4-12.0 contained high levels of CD63 and moderate levels of CD9 and CD81. Previous publications have classified this group as true exosomes, distinct from viral particles and apoptotic bodies [16, 50, 79] . Second, in fractions 14.4-15.6, CD63 was present in moderate amounts, whereas levels of CD9 and CD81 increased. This population was also consistent with an exosomal category containing viral particles demonstrated in previous publications [16, 50, 79] , although, in our case, this group is likely to be exosomes that are larger in size or more dense than the smaller ones seen in fractions 8.4-12.0. Finally, the 16.8-18.0 fractions showed a distinct reduction of CD63 but a drastic increase in CD9, CD81, and Actin. It is likely that these larger or denser vesicles are not true exosomes but either microvesicles or apoptotic bodies. In contrast, V2CI cells had a noticeably different distribution of exosomal markers, although 3 distinct populations were still present ( Figure 6B ). Fractions 8.4-9.6 were almost absent in CD9 and CD81, although CD63 was still present in higher amounts compared with background. In addition, a shift to the right of the major CD63 + CD9 + CD81 + population from fractions 10. exosomes) consistent with our previous observations [12, 13] , but it may also be released in other larger vesicles and potentially as free protein or within protein complexes.",

            "text": "Our rationale for utilizing 0.22-\u03bcm filters in our experiments was based upon the knowledge that Ebola virions and VLPs are commonly 1-2 \u03bcm in size or larger, are rarely straight, and therefore should not be able to effectively pass through a 0.22-\u03bcm filter [36, 37, 39, 42, 80] . In fact, Beniac et al [80] previously showed that approximately 53% of infectious virions were 982 \u00b1 79 nm in length, with all other virions occurring in multiples of that size. No smaller virions containing complete genomes were observed in their investigation of over 2000 virions by electron microscopy. On the other hand, EVs and exosomes below 220 nm in diameter will be able to pass through 0.22-\u03bcm filtration for downstream analysis. To test this concept, we used VLPs containing VP40, NP, and GP EBOV proteins. A simple filtration (0.22 \u03bcm) of VLPs spiked into 1 mL PBS is shown in Supplementary Figure 2A , alongside filtered PBS alone (mock) and unfiltered VLP controls. Filtered samples were incubated with NT80/82 particles and processed for western blot analysis of EBOV proteins. The results indicate that filtration of VLPs in small volumes drastically reduced the levels of EBOV proteins present to undetectable levels. Next, to further characterize the distribution of VLPs in comparison to EVs by size, we spiked 10 \u03bcg of VLPs into 10 mL of V2CH supernatants. VLP-spiked supernatants were then either filtered (0.22 \u03bcm) or left unfiltered and incubated with a vesicle-enrichment agent (ExoMAX). The resulting material was then loaded on top of qEV (IZON) size exclusion columns, and fractions were collected corresponding to the column void volume (fraction nos. 2-6) and those known to contain vesicles larger than 70 nm in diameter (fraction nos. 7-11). Fractions were next incubated with NT80/82 particles to concentrate material, followed by western blot analysis for viral proteins, exosomal markers, and Actin. Results in Supplementary Figure 2B show that, unsurprisingly, proteins originating from unfiltered VLPs mostly appeared in the first fraction after the void volume of the column (fraction no. 7), with some overlap into the next 1-2 fractions. This was shown by the strong presence of NP and GP, particularly the larger glycosylated form of GP, and the low levels of Actin, which we have not observed to be present in our control VLP but is present in EVs (Supplementary Figure 2B , compare lane 1 to lanes 9-12). However, upon filtration through 0.22 \u03bcm, approximately all EBOV proteins vanished from fraction number 7, and there was a sizeable reduction in the levels of GP and NP in fraction numbers 8 and 9. Notably, not all NPs and GPs 1,2 (originating from VLPs) were eliminated from the fractions after filtration.",

            "text": "Another interesting observation centered around the visible forms of GP. Specifically, in the unfiltered fractions, with the higher fraction numbers (corresponding to smaller vesicles), the larger glycosylated form of GP decreased while the levels of lower molecular weight forms of GP increased. In the filtered fractions, the glycosylated larger form of GP was present only at very low levels, whereas lower molecular weight GP levels were relatively high. In comparison to the VLP control (lane 1), the predominant form of GP present was the glycosylated form. Together, these results suggest that glycosylated GPs may be the principal form within VLPs, whereas the lower molecular weight forms of GP may be more likely to be associated with EVs. Collectively, these data may indicate that VLPs appear mainly in the larger fraction number 7 and to a lesser extent in fraction numbers 8 and 9, whereas EVs and true exosomes will be present in fraction numbers 8-11.",

To address this, we infected HUVECs with EBOV/Kik (MOI of 1) under BSL-4 containment for 3 days, followed by harvesting of the supernatants, filtration through 0.22 \u03bcm, and incubation with ExoMAX. Enriched vesicles were then loaded onto qEV size exclusion columns. Fraction numbers 7-10 were then collected, incubated with NT80/82 particles, and analyzed by western blot for EBOV proteins VP40, NP, and GP, and Actin. Results in Figure 7A demonstrate that VP40, NP, and GP were all present in the EVs concentrated from EBOV-infected cells. In addition, all 3 EBOV proteins were observed to be most highly concentrated in fraction number 8, followed closely by fraction number 9, which we had shown to be the fractions where most EVs and exosomes appear (Supplementary Figure 2B ). VP40 and NP were also present in fraction number 7, whereas GP was present at very low levels in this fraction. It is possible that this fraction may represent slightly larger vesicles that do not incorporate GP. All 3 proteins were much less abundant in fraction number 10, which contained smaller vesicles. Actin followed a similar trend, with the most Actin present in fraction numbers [8] [9] , and little to no detectable protein present in fraction numbers 7 or 10. Collectively, these results indicate that not only VP40 but GP and NP are also packaged into vesicles in cells actively infected with EBOV.",

Inactivated samples were filtered (0.22 \u03bcm), EVs were concentrated with NT80/82 particles, and samples were analyzed by western blot for levels of VP40 and exosomal proteins. Data in Figure 7B show that exosomes from all 3 NHP serum samples were concentrated, as demonstrated by the presence of CD81 and CD9 tetraspanins. In addition, VP40 appeared at fairly high levels in the 2 serum samples from infected animals. Quantitative densitometry was used to calculate the approximate amounts of VP40 present in our V2CH cell EVs and how much was released from infected NHP samples. V2CH cells released approximately 13.7 ng of EV-associated VP40/mL, whereas NHP 2 and NHP 3 released ~319 and ~206.5 ng of EV-associated VP40/mL serum, respectively. In addition, we determined that VP40 composed on average approximately 55.8% of purified VLPs (containing GP, NP, and VP40; data not shown). It is interesting to note that more VP40 was present from NHP 2 serum, which succumbed to infection sooner (day 7 vs day 12) and whose serum was collected at earlier time points in infection in comparison with NHP 3 (days 4-5 vs days [8] [9] [10] [11] . Therefore, these results indicate that VP40 is present in EVs from in vivo EBOV infection, with higher levels potentially being prevalent during earlier time points or with more robust infection. Although western blot confirmed the presence of captured exosomes, we cannot be certain that we did not capture other EVs or free proteins in our analysis of NHP samples. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that VP40 may be present in not only exosomes, but also a combination of EVs and/or as a free protein in vivo. Taken together, these results indicate that relatively high levels of VP40, NP, and GP 1,2 are present in EVs from cells infected with EBOV both in vitro and in vivo.",

We have previously shown that EVs from V2CL cells can induce death in recipient immune cells [12, 13] . Therefore, to test the ability of recipient cells to withstand low versus high levels of EV-associated VP40, we incubated CEM, Jurkat, U937, and 293T cells with 5-day filtered supernatants from 293T, V2CL, and V2CH cells, followed by measurement of cell viability 5 days later. Results in Figure 8A show that CEM and Jurkat T cells had a similar reduction in cellular viability from treatment with supernatants from both V2CL and V2CH cells. However, treatment of U937 monocytes with supernatants from these 2 lines showed a dose-dependent reduction in cellular viability. These data suggest that the T cells were equally sensitive to both low and high levels of extracellular VP40, whereas monocytes were more sensitive to higher doses of EV-associated VP40. It is interesting to note that when 293T cells were incubated with supernatants from VP40-expressing cells, 293T cells showed a significant increase in viability, potentially indicating a cell-type dependent mechanism of cell death induction by EV-associated VP40. The mechanism of cell death under these conditions has not been previously explored. Along these lines, we incubated recipient CEM and Jurkat T cells and U937 monocytes with increasing concentrations of EVs from V2CL cells, EVs from control 293T cells, and EVs from their own cell type that were produced in the absence of VP40. Western blots were performed for cell death markers including Caspase 3 and PARP-1. Data in Figure 8B -D show that treatment with increasing concentrations of EVs from V2CL cells induced cell death by apoptosis, as shown by cleavage of Caspase 3 and PARP-1, in recipient T cells and monocytes. This phenotype was not observed with 293T cell EV treatment or EVs from the same cell type. It should be noted that very high levels of EVs from 293T cells stimulated some low levels of PARP-1 cleavage in all cell types; however, there was no cleavage of Caspase 3 detected. Together, these data indicate that EVs from VP40-producing cells cause death by apoptosis in recipient T cells and monocytes.",

Data in Figure 9A show that in comparison with CEM cells treated with the highest concentration of 293T EVs (75 000 particles/cell), there was a significant dose-dependent decrease in recipient cell viability when treated with purified EVs from V2CH cells. This finding further verifies that EVs from V2C cells negatively impact recipient immune cells. Given our previous characterization of EVs from V2CI cells in comparison with 293T cells (Figure 6 ), we next wished to determine which EV fractions were responsible for the induction of cell death in recipient cells. Supernatants from 293T and V2CI cells were harvested and separated through an iodixanol gradient, followed by pooling of select fractions from each cell type. Pooling of fractions 13.2 + 14.4 and 16.8 + 18.0 were chosen because, in V2CI cells, these were the 2 groups with the highest levels of VP40 and exosomal markers. Pooled fractions were then diluted in sterile PBS and subjected to a second ultracentrifuge spin to isolate the EVs away from residual iodixanol. The resulting EV pellets were then resuspended in PBS and used to treat recipient CEM cells at a concentration of 10 000 particles/cell for 5 days, followed by analysis of cell viability. Treatment with EVs from the 13.2 + 14.4 fractions from V2CI cells resulted in a significant decrease in viability in CEM cells in comparison with those treated with 293T EVs from the same fractions ( Figure 9B ). On the other hand, T cells treated with the 16.8 + 18.0 fractions from either cell type did not differ in their viability. Collectively, these data may signify that the EVs within the 13.2 and 14.4 fractions from V2C cells can induce cell death in recipient immune cells.",

            "text": "Our data showed that EVs from VP40-producing cells were capable of causing apoptosis in recipient immune cells ( Figure 8 ) and that the biogenesis of these EVs was potentially tied to regulation of the cell cycle (Figures 4 and 5) . Furthermore, we demonstrated that accelerated cell cycle was potentially driven by the upregulation of cyclin D1 by nuclear VP40 (Figure 2 ). Therefore, we next investigated the utility of cdk4/6 inhibitors Fascaplysin and Ribociclib (LEE011; FDA-approved) in reducing EV production from 293T and V2CH cells. Cells were treated for 5 days with increasing concentrations of Fascaplysin (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 \u00b5M) and Ribociclib (0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 \u00b5M), followed by analysis of cell viability and EV concentration. When 293T cells were treated with low levels of either inhibitor, the number of EVs released significantly decreased. However, with increasing concentrations of drugs, the production of vesicles increased in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 10A ). These results may be due to the toxicity of the drugs at high levels, as the viability of both 293T and V2CH cells were significantly decreased with increased doses of either drug ( Figure 10B ). More specifically, low levels of cdk4/6 inhibitors in 293T cells may result in the blocking of cell cycle at G 1 , and thereby result in lower levels of EVs released, whereas higher levels of the drugs may become toxic, and result in the increased release of vesicles. In contrast, V2CH cells showed significantly decreased levels of EV production with all doses of Fascaplysin, although with the highest dose EV production decreased less significantly in comparison to the lowest dose tested ( Figure 10A ). These EV reductions occurred despite significant decreases in cell viability in V2CH cells ( Figure 10B ). Ribociclib treatment of V2CH cells showed less significant results compared with Fascaplysin treatment, with only the highest dose resulting in any significant reduction of EV numbers or cellular viability ( Figure 10A and B) . Together, these results suggest that Fascaplysin treatment results in fewer EVs from V2CH cells compared with 293T cells with higher doses, although high doses also result in significant decreases in viability in both cell types. In addition, Ribociclib treatment may impact the cell viability and EV biogenesis of VP40-producing cells less than 293T cells. The indication that 293T cells react to both cdk4/6 inhibitors in a similar way, but V2CH cells do not, hints that these drugs may impact cell cycle regulation and EV biogenesis pathways in distinctly different ways. Although the mechanism of action for Fascaplysin is currently uncharacterized, Ribociclib is known to interact directly with cdk4 and cdk6 molecules at their ATP pocket [84, 85] . Future study into the divergent mechanisms used by these drugs and how they may interact with pathways modulated by VP40 may potentially be advantageous to determine the potential therapeutic utility of cdk4/6 inhibitors in infection.",

We also confirmed here that the mechanism of cell death is by apoptosis (Figure 8 ). Along these lines, we attempted to gain insight into proteins contained in VP40 exosomes that may potentially point to a mechanism for the induction of cell death in recipient cells. 293T, V2CL, and V2CH cells were cultured for 5 days in exosome-free media. Supernatants were harvested, filtered (0.22 \u00b5m), and incubated with ExoMAX to enrich for EVs. Samples were then loaded onto a 6%-18% OptiPrep iodixanol gradient, and 10.8 and 12.0 fractions were harvested for use. We chose the 10.8 and 12.0 fractions because previous publications have shown that these fractions are specifically enriched for exosomes, with fewer contaminating vesicles or viral particles [16, 79] . Fractions were then incubated with NT80/82 particles and processed for analysis of tandem mass spectra. The data presented in Supplementary Table 1 These data support our previous conclusions that the EVs from V2C cells are shifted more towards the right (ie, are more dense; Figure 6 ), and therefore they may contain a greater and more diverse quantity of cargo. The presence of heat shock protein (HSP)90, HSP70, and heat shock cognate 71 seen in abundance across all 3 cell types was indicative of all samples containing exosomes. A large increase in the number of proteins related to RNA binding was seen with increasing levels of VP40. Specifically, numerous RNA binding proteins, including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, were found in EVs from V2C cells, whereas only 1 was detected in 293T cell EVs. In addition, several DEAD-box protein (DDX)-type helicases were shown to be upregulated in EVs from VP40-producing cells. Other categories of interest that were upregulated with the presence of VP40 included additional vesicle-associated, translation-associated, nuclear or transcription-associated, proteasome or cell death-related, protein transport, and RNA splicing proteins. Of particular interest, 3 cytokines (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], transforming growth factor beta-1 [TGF-\u03b21] precursor, and insulin-like growth factor II [IGF-II]) and 2 corresponding binding proteins (latent-transforming growth factor beta-binding protein 1 precursor and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 4 precursor) were found to be present in the EVs.",

            "text": "It has been well documented that an eruption of cytokines, or a \"cytokine storm, \" often accompanies fatal cases of EBOV infection [6, 8, 86, 87] . Specifically, cytokines including granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), growth-regulated oncogene (GRO)-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, IL-18, interferon (IFN)-\u03b1, -\u03b2, and -\u03b3, IFN-inducible protein-10 (IP10), Eotaxin, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b1 and -1\u03b2, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF), RANTES, TGF-\u03b21, TNF-\u03b1, and VEGF have all been implicated as differentially up-or downregulated during EBOV pathogenesis [8, [86] [87] [88] [89] . This led us to question whether additional cytokines could potentially be present or upregulated in VP40 exosomes or EVs. To this end, filtered 5-day supernatants and pooled 10.8-12.0 exosome fractions from 293T and V2CH cells were run side-by-side on human cytokine arrays. Filtered exosome-free DMEM media was also used as control. Densitometry was then performed, and cytokine counts above the DMEM background levels were graphed in Supplementary  Figure 3 . In the supernatants, some cytokines (ENA-78, IL-12, IL-15, RANTES, TNF-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b2, epidermal growth factor [EGF], IGF-1, and Oncostatin M) were present at higher levels in V2CH cells compared with 293T cells (Supplementary Figure 3A ). In contrast, 293T cell supernatants were slightly more enriched in several different cytokines (GRO, GRO-\u03b1, I-309, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3). However, when cytokines from the enriched exosomal fractions were analyzed, an increase in almost all cytokine levels was observed compared with those seen in whole supernatants (Supplementary Figure 3B vs A) . In particular, V2CH exosomes possessed higher levels of ENA-78, GRO, IL-12, IL-15, IFN-\u03b3, MCP-1, MCSF, MIG, TARC, TGF-\u03b21, TNF-\u03b2, EGF, and Oncostatin M and lower amounts of MIP-1 \u03b4 and leptin compared with 293T exosomes. Additional cytokines that were undetectable in whole supernatants that were found in exosomal samples included IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, MCP-1, -2, and -3, MCSF, macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC), stem cell factor (SCF), angiogenin, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) BB, and leptin. This finding could potentially be due to our selective enrichment workflow, such that concentrations of cytokine-associated exosomes were much higher than those in whole supernatant samples and therefore more easily detected by the assay. Cytokines such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), GM-CSF, GRO-\u03b1, I-309, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, MCP-2, MCP-3, MDC, RANTES, SCF, SDF-1, TNF-\u03b1, IGF-1, angiogenin, thrombopoietin, VEGF, and PDGF BB were present in both 293T and V2CH exosomes at similar levels. It is interesting to note that exosomes from both cell types were shown to possess VEGF, TGF-\u03b21, and IGF-1, further supporting our MS results (Supplementary Table 1) . Collectively, these data indicate that EVs, specifically exosomes, from VP40-producing cells may contain a diverse set of unique or upregulated proteins. In addition, a plethora of cytokines are associated with vesicles released from virally affected and healthy host cells. Moreover, specific cytokines may be concentrated within EVs from cells producing VP40, which may potentially play a role in the cytokine storm associated with the pathogenesis of EBOV, induction of cell death in recipient immune cells, and poor outcome of infected individuals. DISCUSSION We previously showed that EBOV VP40 can become incorporated into exosomes and thereby negatively impact recipient T cells and monocytes [12, 13] . In line with this, we have additionally shown here that VP40-containing vesicles can induce cell death by apoptosis in these recipient cells (Figure 8 ). This cell death was more exacerbated in monocytes treated with EVs from cells that produced higher levels of VP40. On the other hand, EVs from cells that produced both low and high levels of VP40 were equally destructive to T cells. Bystander T-cell death by apoptosis is one of the hallmarks of EVD, especially fatal cases [5, 7, 9, 10, [81] [82] [83] . Furthermore, we determined that VP40 EVs that sediment within the 13.2 and 14.4 fractions of iodixanol density gradients are able to significantly reduce recipient T-cell death, but EVs that fall in the 16.8 and 18.0 fractions do not ( Figure 9B ). This finding may be noteworthy, because we believe the 16.8 + 18.0 fractions mainly contain apoptotic bodies, large microvesicles, and VLPs in the case of V2C cells, thus potentially indicating that these other extracellular particles may not be a significant contributor to the overall decreased health of recipient immune cells. Therefore, VP40 EVs of intermediate density may comprise a potential mechanism of bystander immune cell apoptosis in EVD. Interestingly, in contrast to immune cells, 293T (human embryonic kidney epithelial) cells that were treated with EVs from both low and high V2C cells showed an increased cell viability. This could potentially be due to a cell type-dependent mechanism of action on recipient cells by VP40-associated vesicles. In addition, 293T cells may be altogether resistant to VP40 EV components responsible for cell death in immune cells and may conversely be positively stimulated by the vesicles. Further study into the specific components responsible for these phenotypes in recipient cells is needed, but the resistance of certain cell types could be quite significant in the context of infection. Monocytes or macrophages and dendritic cells are the first sustained target of EBOV, and T cells die relatively early in infection; however, epithelial and endothelial cells are also productively infected by the virus, albeit at later time points in infection [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . If these uninfected nonimmune cells (endothelial and epithelial) are bombarded with vesicles containing viral components such as VP40 during early infection, it is possible that the recipient cells may be stimulated and primed for future infection. This type of mechanism has been seen before in the case of HIV-1 TAR, in which exosomes containing this viral RNA predisposed recipient cells to be more receptive to infection [26] . Should this type of pathogenic process take place, inhibition of vesicle biogenesis from infected cells should be further explored to determine potential benefits in recipient cells.",

            "text": "To determine pathways contributing to EV biogenesis in donor cells, we investigated the cell cycle of VP40-producing cells. Our rationale for doing these experiments was that when cells contained VP40, they replicated faster than control cells, leading us to ask whether cell cycle patterns were affected. While exploring differences in cell cycle dynamics with the VP40-producing clones, it is important to note that although our vectors have SV40 origin of replication and cells contain T-antigen, it is possible that over time few copies of the plasmid can be integrated into the host genome because these cells are Rec+ and allow recombination. However, we have not observed any differences between these clones that cannot be attributed to a dose response of VP40 production and cell cycle effects. Here, V2C cells were observed to be altered in a cell cycle-dependent manner in not only their exosomal biogenesis pathway components (ESCRT proteins), but also in their morphology, growth patterns, and EV content and abundance (Figures 1,  4 , 5, and 6). Moreover, V2C cells exhibited increased levels of cyclin D1 protein and activity ( Figure 2 ). Cyclin D1 is a well described cell cycle regulator and a potential oncogene known to be upregulated in several cancers [62] [63] [64] . In addition, cyclin D1 was previously shown to be produced at elevated levels as a result of many viral infections, especially those known to cause cancers [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] . Although EBOV has not been shown to result in higher incidences of cancer in survivors, it is possible that this phenotype may be a transient one and only in effect for a brief time before other virulence factors and the replication of the virus results in the infected cells' death. Because EBOV has been shown to best thrive in actively growing cells [90] , upregulation of cyclin D1 may simply be a strategy used by the virus to aid its own replication. However, larger proportions of recurrent, persistent, and asymptomatic EBOV infections have come to light with study of the increasing numbers of EBOV survivors, which is a significant topic of concern, as this can potentially lead to transmission of virus and future outbreaks [91] [92] [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] [98] [99] [100] . How the virus manages to remain long term within human and NHP hosts has not yet been conclusively determined; however, viral persistence and replication within CD68 + monocyte or macrophage cell types has been detected within the brain, eyes, and testes of NHP survivors of infection [101] . If these central nervous system-resident myeloid cells are also dysregulated in cell cycle, this could potentially represent a method used by EBOV to counteract its own cytotoxicity to support prolonged viral replication or latency.",

Here, we have shown that VP40 is present at relatively high levels within the nucleus of stably transfected cells, and that VP40 is found on a large proportion of cyclin D1 promoters ( Figure 2C and D) . It may be possible that early in infection, VP40 translocation into the nucleus may serve a role in transcriptional regulation of host genes to best benefit the virus. In all likelihood, nuclear VP40 action as a transcriptional regulator is not limited to the cyclin D1 gene. Investigation into the direct interactions and far-reaching effects of VP40 in the nucleus could be vitally important for elucidating the molecular basis of EBOV pathogenesis in host cells.",

            "text": "Cell cycle dysregulation of VP40-producing cells also resulted in an altered pattern of EV biogenesis (Figures 4 and 5) . It is interesting that all cells tested at G 0 produced significantly fewer EVs that were also larger than unsynchronized controls. Because many eukaryotic cells are quiescent in normal, healthy, in vivo environments, this could represent an important trend that inherently differentiates EVs from cells that are not frequently dividing versus actively replicating or cancer cells. Our results also showed that EVs from VP40-producing cells were generally fewer in number but denser and larger in size ( Figures 5 and 6 ). Larger vesicles of higher density would imply an enrichment of cargo within VP40 EVs, which was supported by a greater abundance of proteins detected by MS analysis (Supplementary Table 1 ). The increased numbers and diversity of proteins found in EVs from VP40-producing cells could influence the outcomes of recipient cells, particularly if those proteins were associated with nucleic acids. A collection of RNA-binding proteins was found from MS analysis of EVs from V2C cells, and although we do not yet know the RNAs associated with these proteins, they may be important for activities in recipient cells. An assortment of cytokines was also found, with an upregulation of IFN-\u03b3, IL-15, MCP-1, and TGF-\u03b21 seen in VP40 EVs (Supplementary Figure 3) . That we were able to detect these cytokines at elevated levels in exosomal preparations from VP40-producing cells may indicate that VP40 stimulates the production of some of these, potentially as other direct or indirect targets of nuclear VP40 transcriptional regulation. Moreover, the fact that we were able to detect cytokines in exosomal preps in all cell types is a significant finding in and of itself. In our study, the majority of cytokines tested were enriched in exosomes compared with whole supernatants. If this is the case in vivo, vesicles heavily laden with cytokines originating from infected cells could act as a \"cytokine bomb\" on recipient immune cells. In this way, a few EVs from a single diseased cell would be able to enact devastating effects on a recipient cell. This may also be of substantial importance for many other viral or inflammatory diseases in which cytokines play an inflammatory or damaging role.",

Results showed that Fascaplysin was able to significantly decrease the number of vesicles produced from both 293T and V2CH cells with low, nontoxic doses. In contrast, Ribociclib was only able to decrease levels of EVs produced from 293T cells at doses that did not affect cell viability. The differences between 293T and V2CH cell responses to the inhibitors suggest that VP40-producing cells may be less susceptible to the effects of Ribociclib. Future mechanistic studies into the molecular action of these drugs in connection with VP40 may elucidate potential therapeutic utility or other more directed drug targets.",

Here, we show that VP40 is found within EVs isolated from both in vitro and in vivo wild-type EBOV infection ( Figure 7A and B) . Furthermore, EVs from EBOV-infected cells contained both NP and GP proteins of the virus. NP is responsible for encapsidating the RNA genome of the virus as soon as it is synthesized and for formation of the nucleocapsid (in conjunction with other viral proteins) [102] . Because NP is the main viral protein responsible for binding of the RNA genome (each NP is bound to 6 bases of RNA [103] ), the presence of NP within EVs could also potentially hint at the presence of bound viral RNA within EVs as well. On the other hand, GP is the sole surface protein of EBOV and is important for both viral entry and egress [104] . GP has also been implicated in pathogenesis, because GP itself has shown cytotoxic effects in infected cells. Furthermore, soluble GP is found in large quantities in the blood of infected patients, and it has been proposed to potentially play a role in immune evasion by absorption of neutralizing antibodies [105, 106] . Our experiments involving filtration of VLPs followed by size exclusion separation of extracellular materials showed that VLPs were able to be removed from samples by filtration, whereas smaller vesicles in the VLP preparations that contained EBOV proteins were able to pass through 0.22-\u00b5m filtration (Supplementary Figure 2B) . These results also interestingly hinted towards a potential role for GP in EVs, as unfiltered VLPs showed enrichment of primarily glycosylated GP in the fractions corresponding to larger vesicles (fraction number 7), whereas filtered VLPs showed mainly lower molecular weight forms of GP, which colocalized with exosomal markers. Therefore, if EVs are studded with GP proteins, this could form an additional previously unknown source of immune subversion and viral masking used by EBOV. Presence of other viral proteins or RNAs in EVs were not explored here and will be analyzed in future studies.",

The 10.8 fractions from 293T, V2CL, and V2CH cells had 826, 537, and 261 detected proteins, respectively, potentially showing an overall decrease in the number of proteins present with increase in VP40 production levels (data not shown). However, for the 12.0 fraction, the opposite trend was seen: 293T, V2CL, and V2CH EVs had 387, 1393, and 1680 proteins identified, respectively (data not shown). These results could potentially indicate that the total number of EVs had shifted from the 10.8 fraction more towards the 12.0 fraction for V2C cells, whereas 293T cells possibly possessed more EVs in the 10.8 fraction in comparison to the 12.0.",
