The relative 5-year survival rate is about 15% and can be attributed to an advanced stage of disease at the time of diagnosis, the occurrence of cirrhosis and of other co-morbidites [1] . Detection of early stages of disease is essential for an improved prognosis and overall survival. However, apart from alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) only a few serological markers are available in clinical practice (such as Glypican-3, miR-21, fucosylated GP73, \u03b1-fucosidase) with AFP diagnostics remaining unsatisfactory because of its low sensitivity and the non-specific correlation between the clinical behavior of HCC and AFP blood levels.

Importantly, in the study of Battaglia and coworkers [122] 1 mM agmatine induced large amounts of superoxide production in rat liver mitochondria; however, it did not affect mitochondrial respiration or redox levels of thiols and glutathione. Furthermore, ATP synthesis remained normal and prevented Ca(2+)-induced mitochondrial permeability transition in the presence of phosphate to suggest an intriguing regulatory loop whereby H2O2 induces hypoxia signalling that is linked to abberant metabolism, nonetheless by selecting interconnected physiological pathways tumour cells are equipped to avoid programmed cell death [122, 123] .

Master regulatory networks for regulated proteins with link to EGFR signalling: (A) The PDIA4 network consists of 68 proteins including 32 significantly regulated proteins, (B) the APEH network consists of 68 proteins including 32 significantly regulated proteins, (C) the PEBP1 network consists of 63 proteins including 31 significantly regulated proteins, (D) the APOE network consists of 66 proteins including 31 significantly regulated proteins, (E) the ARG1 network consists of 67 proteins including 31 significantly regulated proteins, (F) the FBP1 network consists of 69 proteins including 31 significantly regulated proteins, (G) the HAAO network consists of 66 proteins including 32 significantly regulated proteins. Note, all networks display connectivity to EGF protein (yellow coloured inner node). The master regulator, the connecting proteins (network elements) and regulated proteins are given as red, green and blue coloured inner node, respectively. Furthermore, each node is partioned into four segments whereas the first segment seen from left refers to tumour specific proteins and is red-coloured. The second, third and fourth segments refer to either up-and down-regulated proteins, tumour specific gene expression changes and gene regulations in transgenic non-tumour liver tissue, respectively. Increased expression of either proteins or genes is given in red, whereas the blue colour denotes repressed expression.Additional file 14: Table S12 . Protein interaction information of the fused network. Given are interacting proteins with association score from different prediction methods, i.e. Neighborhood, Gene Fusion, Co-occurrence, Co-expression, Databases and Textmining.Additional file 15: Table S13 . Biological pathways and their cluster for fused network proteins. REACTOME, KEGG and WikiPathways database information was used as input data file for Cytoscape 3.0.2. The table shows grouping of significant pathway terms (p \u2264 0.01) and is based on a kappa score of 0.4, initial group size of 2 and sharing group percentage of 50.Additional file 16: Table S14 .
