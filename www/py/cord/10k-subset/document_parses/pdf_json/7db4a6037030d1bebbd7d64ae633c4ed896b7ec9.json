            "text": "Petri disease of grapevine is primarily caused by Phaeomoniella chlamydospora. This pathogen affects mostly young grapevines, but is also implicated in esca disease of older grapevines. Little is known about the disease cycle of this fungus. Infected propagation material was identified as a major means of dissemination of the pathogen. Recently, the pathogen was also detected from soil in South Africa and airborne conidia have been found in vineyards. The aim of this study was to use a molecular detection technique to test different samples collected from nurseries in South Africa at different nursery stages for the presence of P. chlamydospora. A one-tube nested-PCR technique was optimised for detecting P. chlamydospora in DNA extracted from soil, water, callusing medium and grapevine wood. The one-tube nested-PCR was sensitive enough to detect as little as 1 fg of P. chlamydospora genomic DNA from water and 10 fg from wood, callusing medium and soil. PCR analyses of the different nursery samples revealed the presence of several putative 360 bp P. chlamydospora specific bands. Subsequent sequence analyses and/ or restriction enzyme digestions of all 360 bp PCR bands confirmed that all bands were P. chlamydospora specific, except for five bands obtained from callusing media and one from water. Phaeomoniella chlamydospora was positively detected in 25% of rootstock cane sections collected from mother blocks, 42% of rootstock cuttings and 16% of scion cuttings collected during grafting, 40% of water samples collected after pre-storage hydration, 67% of water samples collected during grafting, 8% of callusing medium samples and 17% of soil samples collected from mother blocks. These media can therefore be considered as possible inoculum sources of the pathogen during the nursery stages.",

            "text": "Petri disease (previously known as 'black goo' and Petri grapevine decline) causes a reduction in the survival rate of young grapevines (Mugnai et al., 1999) . External symptoms of Petri disease include stunted growth, shorter internodes, small leaves, interveinal chlorosis, smaller trunks and branches and a general decline of young vines resulting in plant death (Morton, 1995; Bertelli et al., 1998; Ferreira, 1998; Fourie et al., 2000; Sidoti et al., 2000; Whiteman et al., 2003) . Internal symptoms include a black discolouration and tyloses formation in the xylem vessels (Ferreira, 1998) . Phaeomoniella chlamydospora and Phaeoacremonium aleophilum have been isolated from grapevine material showing these symptoms and are considered to be the causal organisms of this disease. In New Zealand, the fungus that was most commonly isolated from diseased vines was P. chlamydospora (Whiteman et al., 2003) , as was the case in South Africa . Wallace et al. (2003) inoculated grapevine cuttings with P. chlamydospora and P. aleophilum and found that P. chlamydospora caused brown wood streaking in the rootstock cultivars, but not in the scion varieties and that no visible internal symptoms were caused by P. aleophilum. They suggested P. chlamydospora to be the more virulent fungus. Collectively, these results indicate that P. chlamydospora is the main causal organism of Petri disease.",

Spores and hyphal fragments of P. chlamydospora have been randomly detected along the full length of canes (Feliciano and Gubler, 2001; Edwards et al., 2003) .

One of the earliest stages where infection can occur is when rootstock and scion cuttings are harvested and drenched in hydration tanks for periods of up to 12 h prior to cold storage ( Van der Westhuizen, 1981) . Following cold storage, rootstock and scion cuttings are again drenched in hydration or fungicide tanks during the grafting process (this can occur pregrafting and/or pre-callus). In South Africa, grafted cuttings are callused in callusing medium consisting of fresh pine sawdust that was drenched in a broad-spectrum fungicide suspension, such as captan (Van der Westhuizen, 1981) . The callusing media might also be a potential inoculum source (Whiteman et al., 2003) . In New Zealand nurseries, it was found that P. chlamydospora was present at all stages, especially in drench solutions where there was repeated exposure to plant material and in pre and post storage hydration/ fungicide tanks. The percentage of positive samples was moderate from grafting tool washings and low from washings of callusing media (Whiteman et al., 2003) .",

            "text": "Phaeomoniella chlamydospora and P. aleophilum are difficult to detect using traditional isolation methods due to their slow growth and lack of suitable selective media. Fourie and Halleen (2002) used these methods and found that detection levels in rootstock canes were very low (<0.2%). Therefore, a sensitive molecular technique is required for accurate and sensitive pathogen detection. Previously, a conventional PCR detection method was developed for detection of P. chlamydospora in grapevine wood, detecting up to 1 pg P. chlamydospora DNA (Retief et al., 2005) . However, preliminary studies showed that this technique is not specific and sensitive enough for detection of P. chlamydospora in soil and water (unpublished results). Whiteman et al. (2002) recently published a more sensitive nested-PCR using species-specific primers (Tegli et al., 2000) for detecting as little as 50 fg of P. chlamydospora genomic DNA from artificially infested soil. However, the identity of PCR products obtained with the species-specific primers had to be differentiated from other closely related fungi using restriction enzyme digestion (Whiteman et al., 2002) .",

BLAST analyses showed that the sequences of the majority of the bands were 100% identical to P. chlamydospora (Phaeoacremonium chlamydosporum) in GenBank (accession numbers: AF197986, AF266656, AF266653, AF197987, AF 197973, AF017652). The only samples where 360 bp PCR amplicons could not be identified as being P. chlamydospora, either through sequence or restriction enzyme digests, were in five callusing medium and one water sample. BLAST analyses of the callusing medium and the water amplicons showed that these PCR amplicons had highest homology to Diplotomma venustum (E-value: 10 )41 ), Botryosphaeria stevensii (E-value: 10 )41 ) and Botryosphaeria dothidea (E-value: 10 )87 ). However, the E-values were very low and the identity of these bands could thus not be determined.",

The conventional PCR could detect 1 pg of P. chlamydospora genomic DNA from grapevine wood (Retief et al., 2005) whereas the one-tube nested-PCR analyses could detect as little as 10 fg of P. chlamydospora genomic DNA. The one-tube nested-PCR therefore proved to be a lot more sensitive than the conventional PCR. The chance of contamination of samples leading to false positives is also minimised when using the one-tube nested-PCR as opposed to a conventional nested-PCR technique (Olmos et al., 1999; Tao et al., 2004) .",

It was therefore very important to confirm that 360 bp amplicons were P. chlamydospora specific through restriction enzyme digestions or sequencing. Failing to do so would have resulted in a six-fold overestimation of the incidence of P. chlamydospora in callusing media. Confirmation of the species-specificity of ITS based primers should be considered in more PCR based detection systems, considering that there are an estimated 1.5 million fungal species (Hawksworth, 2001) and that less than 1% of microorganisms are estimated to be culturable from soil (Torsvik and Ovreas, 2002) . The identity of the organisms amplified from water and callusing media with the P. chlamydospora primers in this study are unknown since the BLAST analyses yielded low E-values, due to the short length of the amplified fragments.",
