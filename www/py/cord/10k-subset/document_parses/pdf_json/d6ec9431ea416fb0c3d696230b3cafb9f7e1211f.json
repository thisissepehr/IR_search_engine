Aside from coagulation factor and fibrinogen deficiency due to synthesis disorders, patients may also present with thrombocytopenia due to splenic sequestration, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy or platelet abnormalities due to uremia and acute renal insufficiency. Though recombinant Factor VIIa has been recommended for coagulopathy reversal before ICP monitor placement [14, [30] [31] [32] [33] , use of rFVIIa does not replete other depleted coagulation factors and carries a higher risk of DIC than other agents. In addition, the rate of arterial thrombotic events with rFVIIa is as high as 8.5% [34] . Unactivated prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) (marketed as Bebulin and Profilnine in the US and Octaplex in Europe, and sometimes referred to as Factor IX concentrates) include varying amounts of factors II, VII, IX, X, and protein C and S. PCC, typically dosed as 50 l/kg, comes as a powder that requires reconstitution in 20 ml of sterile water per vial. Coagulopathy reversal of multiple factors can be achieved quickly with minimal volume and a lower expense than rFVIIa. Since PCC does not contain Factor V, some hematologists recommend additional FFP to replace this factor. All the patients should receive vitamin K 10 mg IV once [14] . In addition, if fibrinogen is <100 mg/dl, the patients should be repleted with cryoprecipitate.

Since cerebral blood volume (CBV) is one component of intracranial volume, increases in CBV may increase ICP. Thus, MAP should not be excessively high. However, if autoregulation is partially or regionally intact, under circumstances of low MAP, small cerebral arterioles will dilate in an attempt to maintain CBF. When these arterioles dilate in the vasodilatory cascade zone, CBV increases and, as a consequence, so can ICP. Thus, at very high and very low MAPs, ICP may be elevated.

The effect of hyperventilation is short lived (1-24 h) [54] . since the CSF will rapidly buffer the alkalotic effect. Barbituate coma is considered the last course of action for ICP control in liver failure patients. Pentobarbital (5-20 mg/kg IV bolus followed by 1-4 mg/kg/h) is typically used and titrated to burst suppression on continuous EEG. Barbituates cause loss of the entire neurological exam including brainstem reflexes and, in addition, carry the complications of cardiosuppression, immunosuppression, and profound hypotension.

The true incidence of seizure in fulminant liver failure patients is not clear. Hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, uremia, and intracranial hemorrhage, which are all co-morbidities of acute liver failure, are common causes of seizure. Typically, fulminant liver failure induces a GABAnergic state, with concomitant low NMDA activity, which is generally protective against seizures. However, mitochondrial dysfunction induced by an acute hyperammonemic states can lead to seizures, as it does in Reye syndrome and other inborn errors of metabolism [55] . In a study conducted in 42 patients with acute liver failure, seizure activity was identified in up to 32% of patients [56] . The authors do not provide any imaging, medication or metabolic data to determine if other etiologies for seizure were present. In addition, some patients included in this study were post-transplant. The posttransplantation state is accompanied by acute GABAnergic withdrawal, and is actually a higher risk time for seizure activity. The rate of seizure in this study may actually be an underestimate since the authors used a hairline EEG montage and patients were paralyzed, thus minimizing detection of clinical seizures. Another study found a seizure rate of 25% in acute liver failure patients, but similarly did not account for confounders and did not use continuous EEG monitoring [57] . Our recommendation is to utilize continuous EEG monitoring in all grade III/IV patients, patients with intracranial hemorrhage or patients with clinical seizure episodes. Since non-convulsive seizures occur in 10-20% of critically ill patients [58] [59] [60] , full montage continuous EEG monitoring is the best form of detection. In addition, paralysis should be avoided, if possible, to allow for detection of subtle clinical spells. There is mixed data on the utility of phenytoin prophylaxis [56, 57] . The patients who have seized should receive antiepileptic treatment. Prophylaxis can be considered for those who have intracranial hemorrhage or very severe cerebral edema, in whom a seizure might cause herniation due to elevated intracranial pressure.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 640, "end": 644, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 766, "end": 770, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1460, "end": 1464, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1711, "end": 1715, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1716, "end": 1720, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1721, "end": 1725, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1963, "end": 1967, "text": "[56,", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1968, "end": 1971, "text": "57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Seizure Prophylaxis and Management"}, {"text": "The toxic acetaminophen metabolite N-acetyl P-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI) is normally detoxified by glutathione conjugation.

The IV route has the advantage of improved GI tolerance and eliminates problems related to absorption [14] . Moreover, based on accumulating evidence for transplant-free survival benefit and its generally favorable safety profile, intravenous NAC should be strongly considered for patients with early stage non-acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure [61] . Treatment should be initiated immediately when ALF or hepatotoxicity is established, with a loading dose of 150 mg/kg in 500 ml dextrose 5% over 30 min, followed by maintenance dose 50 mg/kg over 4 h, then 125 mg/kg in 1000 ml dextrose 5% over 19 h. Most experts recommend a continuous intravenous infusion of NAC until the INR is less than 1.5. Because of risk of hypersensitivity reaction, IV NAC should always be administered in a monitored setting, and the patients with mild allergic symptoms should have the infusion rate decreased by 50% and receive corticosteroids and antihistamines.
