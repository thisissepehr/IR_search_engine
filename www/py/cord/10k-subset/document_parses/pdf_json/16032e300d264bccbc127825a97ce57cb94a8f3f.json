First, we provide the first link between a low serum 25(OH)D level and risk of viral coinfection, specifically the risk of RSV, rhinovirus, or both infections, which were involved in most of the coinfections. Interestingly, the association was demonstrated in the most severe spectrum of viral illness in children with acute wheezing necessitating hospitalization. Moreover, RSV is the dominant cause of bronchiolitis, whereas rhinovirus is the main trigger of wheezing in slightly older children and an important risk factor for asthma. 8 Our results are consistent with multiple epidemiologic studies examining the association between vitamin D intake/level and risk of respiratory tract illness and one randomized controlled trial examining influenza. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Together these findings suggest that vitamin D might play a role in antiviral defense and might be particularly important in children at increased risk of moderate-to-severe viral infections, such as young infants exposed to RSV and high asthma risk children exposed to rhinovirus. The potential beneficial effects of vitamin D in the defense against respiratory tract infections might involve changes in both the innate and adaptive immune systems. 9 Second, one third of the children had low serum 25(OH)D levels. During the study period, the Finnish national recommendation (by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health) for vitamin D supplementation for children less than 12 months of age was 10 mg (1000 IU) per day for 1 year. For children aged 1 to 15 years, the recommendation was 5 to 10 mg/d during the winter months depending on the use of other vitamin D-containing products.

The inverse associations between 25(OH)D levels and specific types of viral infection raise the question of whether vitamin D could moderate the frequency or severity of acute respiratory tract infections. Randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation are warranted to determine whether our findings are truly causal and reversible. One third of the study children had low 25(OH)D levels.
