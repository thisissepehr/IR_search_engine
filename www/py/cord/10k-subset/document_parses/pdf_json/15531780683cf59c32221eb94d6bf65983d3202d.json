Identifying where poultry raisers seek care for their ill poultry might help the government better plan how to disseminate avian influenza prevention and control recommendations. Methods: In order to identify where backyard poultry raisers seek care for their ill poultry, we conducted in-depth and informal interviews: 70 with backyard poultry raisers and six with local poultry healthcare providers in two villages, and five with government veterinary professionals at the sub-district and union levels in two districts during June-August 2009. Results: Most (86% [60/70]) raisers sought care for their backyard poultry locally, 14% used home remedies only and none sought care from government veterinary professionals. The local poultry care providers provided advice and medications (n = 6). Four local care providers had shops in the village market where raisers sought healthcare for their poultry and the remaining two visited rural households to provide poultry healthcare services. Five of the six local care providers did not have formal training in veterinary medicine. Local care providers either did not know about avian influenza or considered avian influenza to be a disease common among commercial but not backyard poultry. The government professionals had degrees in veterinary medicine and experience with avian influenza and its prevention. They had their offices at the sub-district or union level and lacked staffing to reach the backyard raisers at the village level. Conclusions: The local poultry care providers provided front line healthcare to backyard poultry in villages and were a potential source of information for the rural raisers. Integration of these local poultry care providers in the government's avian influenza control programs is a potentially useful approach to increase poultry raisers' and local poultry care providers' awareness about avian influenza.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Bangladesh is a country of more than 150 million people, with 64% living in rural villages [1] .

These findings are consistent with a systematic review that identified factors influencing care seekers to use informal providers for human health problems because of their proximity and flexible working hours [15] . Our findings suggest that local care providers could be a more effective source of communication and a more trusted source for poultry raisers compared to government counterparts and could play a role in both raising awareness among the raisers and providing practical solutions to adopt precautionary behavior. Since these local care providers belong to the community, involving them in the communication campaigns might increase community participation, incorporate local perspective to the communication, empower the community, and result in sustainable improvement in awareness and behavior. Concern for financial gain or loss and convenience were common drivers for both the raisers and the service providers. Raisers preferred local care providers because they wanted to save money for transportation to reach government veterinarians. Since the local care providers were part of the community, villagers could easily reach them or the local providers could visit the villagers' households. Syhakhang et al. showed that 73% of women who visited drug sellers prioritized financial constraints over quality of the drugs in Lao PDR [16] . Repackaging medications into smaller and more affordable units, providing service on credit or accepting in-kind payments when patients do not have cash make the informal providers more affordable for the poor [15, 17] . The local care providers were motivated to serve the backyard raisers for poultry problems as well as human health problems because they recognized the potential to earn a profit by dispensing medicine, as the village doctors reported in another study in Bangladesh [17] . In contrast, government veterinarians did not reach the villagers to provide care for backyard poultry and cited inadequate resource and logistic support as the major barrier. Leonard argued that permitting the government veterinarians to engage in private, fee-for-service practice in Africa provided an incentive to veterinarians to work longer hours in the rural areas [18] .

The lack of government involvement in veterinary care of backyard poultry also means the government may be unaware of poultry die-offs. A study in Nigeria indicated that 57% of respondents with knowledge of avian influenza were unwilling to inform authorities of sudden and massive deaths among their flocks because of fear of culling of birds without compensation (75%) [24] . A survey in Bangladesh showed only 3% of respondents reported unusual poultry deaths to authorities, 73% did not know how to report poultry deaths and 24% did not think reporting was important [6] . As mentioned by a government official in this study, poultry culling activities during avian influenza outbreaks in 2007-08 in Bangladesh had a negative repercussion among the poultry raisers [7] . Poorly executed compensation strategies might have further weakened poultry raisers' trust in the government and discouraged reporting unexplained flock mortality [25] . Political science scholars have noted that residents of Bangladesh generally view their government as corrupt and primarily serving the interest of government workers rather than the general public [26] . In a nationally representative survey, two thirds of Bangladeshi residents reported paying a bribe to a government official within the prior 12 months [27] .

The Government of Bangladesh produces a limited quantity of vaccine for Marek's disease, Newcastle disease, fowl pox, pigeon pox, fowl cholera, salmonellosis, infectious bursal disease and duck plague [35] , though none of the backyard raisers interviewed in these villages reported using these vaccines.

A systematic review reported that educational interventions, including capacity-building training programs for informal healthcare providers, was the most common recommendation by the authors [15] . Lack of academic or institutional training decreases the appropriateness of local healthcare providers' recommendations [39, 40] . Recognition of a legitimate role for these informal providers is likely to provoke resistance by government sanctioned professionals which play the role of \"a guarantor of standards\" but are also strongly motivated to secure profits, power and privilege [43] . National health development strategies have typically ignored the existence of informal healthcare providers [42] , which might result in little support to backyard poultry raisers in resource-poor settings. As Sims argues, in a country like Bangladesh, certain factors, such as complex nature of the poultry production and marketing systems, limited veterinary capacity and low level of commitment from the raisers to country-wide elimination of virus to central government, favored persistence of virus [44] . In such a scenario, co-operation between government service providers and local care providers rather than mutual exclusion, might be a better approach [18, 42] to increase veterinary service capacity to communicate recommendations to prevent avian influenza and promote biosecurity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 194, "end": 198, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 199, "end": 203, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 204, "end": 208, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 209, "end": 213, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 297, "end": 301, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 302, "end": 305, "text": "42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 500, "end": 504, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 627, "end": 631, "text": "[39,", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 632, "end": 635, "text": "40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 892, "end": 896, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1008, "end": 1012, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1404, "end": 1408, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1563, "end": 1567, "text": "[18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1568, "end": 1571, "text": "42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "This research was conducted in only two sub-districts, so it may not be representative of all backyard poultry raisers or veterinary care providers of Bangladesh.

Some government veterinary service providers were reluctant to share information and the team could not corroborate some of the assertions villagers or local care providers made. The study was conducted in 2009 and there was only one reported H5N1 case prior to the data collection of this study, hence it is possible that occurrence of the latter cases, including a fatal one, might have influenced raiser' risk perception and care seeking practices since then. However, since we did not find substantial differences in people's awareness on avian influenza reported in surveys conducted in 2007 [2] and 2014 [47] , we assume that our conclusions remain applicable.
