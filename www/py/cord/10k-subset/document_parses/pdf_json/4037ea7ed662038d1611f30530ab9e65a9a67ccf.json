The FL strain of mouse adenovirus grew in both L 929 murine fibroblasts and in CMT-93 murine rectal carcinoma cells, whereas the K 87 strain grew only in CMT-93 cells. The bulk of the FL progeny virus was released from the host cells. K 87 virus was largely cell-associated. Both virus strains were stable at 37 \u00b0 C in liquid medium. The K 87 strain was completely inactivated after 5-15 minutes at 56 \u00b0 C, whereas FL infectivity was still detected after two hours at this temperature. Both virus strains were stable in the dessicated state for 14 days, although FL viability was more dependent on the presence of protein in the virus diluent. Seroepidemiologic data suggest that viruses antigenically related to mouse adenovirus are more prevalent among laboratory rats than among laboratory mice and that the virus(es) infecting rats differ from those infecting mice. Results of retrospective serologic testing suggest an association between mouse adenovirus and an outbreak of disease in a mouse breeding colony.",

Using antisera made in mice or guinea pigs, VAN D~ VEE>T and MEs (17) found the two virus strains to be antigenicMly distinct by both the complement tixation (CF) and neutralization tests. In contrast, WmAND st al. (19) found that antiserum to MAd-K 87 neutralized both homologous virus and MAd-FL. Antiserum to MAd-FL contained only a low level of neutralizing antibody to MAd-K 87. Using both CF and indirect immunofluoreseence (IFA) tests, we have found that. MAd-FL antiserum from mice exposed once to the virus reacts equally well with MAd-FL and MAd-K 87 antigens, whereas similarly prepared antiserum to MAd-K 87 reacts only with homologous antigen (11) . The source of these discrepancies is not immediately apparent; however, our results may explain why seroconversion to mouse adenovirus is not observed among mice thought to be infected with the virus. MAd-FL has traditionally been used as the test antigen in serologic tests performed in U.S. laboratories. The inability of antibody to MAd-K 87 or an MAd-K 87-like virus to react with MAd-FL antigen would explain the apparent lack of seroconversion among infected mice.",

            "text": "From the laboratory animal perspective, the most important finding presented in this paper is the seroprevalence of MAd, both strains FL and K 87, in laboratory rats. Occasional CF antibody titers have been reported in rats, but these have not been correlated with disease, pathology or virus isolations (9) . There has been one report of intranuclear inclusions and typical adenovirus particles in the intestines ofimmunosuppressed rats (18) , but the responsible agent was not isolated. That adenovirus infection of rats has not been recognized before with any regularity may be due to the test (complement fLxation) which has traditionally been used for antibody detection and to the antigen (MAd-FL) which has been used in that test. The complement fLxation test has been found to be very insensitive for the detection of antibody to many rodent viruses, most notably mouse hepatitis virus (15) . V~re have previously reported that antibody titers to MAd as determined by the indirect immunofluorescence test are approximately 10-fold higher than titers determined from the complement fixation test (11) . Since the pattern of reactivity of rat sera differed substantially from that of mouse sera, it may be hypothesized that the virus(es) infecting rats are antigenically related to, but distinguishable from, the known mouse adenovirus strains. Future efforts will be directed toward isolation of the agent(s) infecting rats for antigenic and biological comparison with the two known strains of mouse adenovirus. We have found, however, that two week-old rats are not susceptible to MAd-K 87 after a route of exposure (oral) which simulates the presumed natural situation (A. L. SMITH and S. W. BARTHOLD, unpublished results).",

            "text": "We have provided serologic evidence linking an outbreak of clinical disease in a breeding colony of mice to infection with MAd-K 87 or a very closely related virus. One observation remains puzzling. MAd-K 87 has never been associated with lethal infection in the experimental situation, irrespective of route of inoculation. Several possibilities must be considered to explain the mortality observed in the outbreak at Yale. One is that the infecting agent, while antigenically very closely related to MAd-K 87, was biologically different. A second relates to the microbiological status of the affected colony at the time of the outbreak. In 1982, mice from this colony had serum antibody to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), reovirus type 3, EDIM virus, TMEV and minute virus of mice (MVM). The role of EDIM virus in this epizootic cannot be evaluated, since the mice used for the antibody production test had already been infected with this agent. TMEV may have played a role, but since only 2 of the 5 inoculated mice made antibody to this agent, it is assumed that the virus was present in the intestinal homogenate at Very low concentration. Also, since TMEV was enzootic at the time of the outbreak of clinical disease, it should not be considered as the primary cause of disease. However, the possibility that intercurrent infection with one or more of these viruses or a particularly virulent bacterial pathogen exacerbated the clinical course of the infection cannot be excluded.",
