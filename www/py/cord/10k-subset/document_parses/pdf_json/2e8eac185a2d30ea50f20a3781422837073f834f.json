Analysis of VH and VL germline back-mutants reveals binding to H3 and H1 but not H5, which supports the critical role of somatic hypermutation in broadening the bnAb response. Moreover, a single VLD94N mutation improves the affinity of 3I14 to H5 by nearly 10-fold. These data provide evidence that memory B cell evolution can expand the HA subtype specificity.

On the basis of their antigenic differences in the virion core proteins, they are divided into three main types: A, B and C. Influenza A viruses are the most pathogenic in humans and are further subclassified by the two major surface proteins: haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). HA is responsible for binding to host sialic acid glycan receptors, mediating cell entry and viral RNA release to the cytoplasm, whereas NA is critical for nascent virion budding out of host cells by cleaving sialic acid 4, 5 . There are 18 HA subtypes and 11 NA subtypes, which make up all known influenza A viruses by various combinations of HA and NA 1-3, 6 . Furthermore, based on the phylogenetic relationships of HA genes, the 18 HA serotypes are classified into two major groups: groups 1 and 2 (ref. 7) (Fig. 1a) . As in all RNA viruses, the low-fidelity of influenza virus polymerases result in high mutation rates 8, 9 . Mutations in the HA and NA genes often impart antigenic changes, known as antigenic drift, that mediate evasion of host immune response by seasonal viruses 10 . In addition, genetic re-assortment between seasonal and animal influenza viral genomes can yield viruses with novel antigenic characteristics that would not be susceptible to human population immunity elicited by seasonal viruses. Human-to-human transmission of such viruses lead to occasional worldwide pandemics 8 .

Currently, influenza vaccination is the most effective disease control intervention but constant surveillance of the antigenic properties of circulating viruses is necessary to update vaccine composition when antigenic drift is detected. Unfortunately, antigenic variants may sporadically emerge after the start of vaccine manufacturing resulting in a poor vaccine match to viruses circulating in the upcoming influenza season. The discovery of human broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that target highly conserved epitopes on the stem region of influenza HA has shed light on a potential pathway to 'universal' flu vaccines. In fact, the stem region has become a main target for development of novel treatments using either antibody-based vaccine design or passive immunotherapy. So far, several bnAbs capable of neutralizing multiple serotypes of influenza A virus within group 1 and/or group 2 have been isolated from immunized mice, phage libraries, memory B or plasma cells of immune donors [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Most bnAbs, such as F10 (ref. 12) , CR6261 (ref. 13) , MAb 3.1 (ref. 18 ) and CR8020 (ref. 14) , neutralize either group 1 or group 2 influenza viruses.

MAb 1.12 and CR9114 were isolated from human-derived phage display libraries that were each derived from a single seasonal influenza experienced donor 16, 19 . Important for the present study, the natural pairs of the variable regions of heavy chain (VH) and light chain (VL) are uncoupled and randomly combined using antibody phage display, which limits the analysis of antibody evolution. MAb FI6 was discovered from approximately 104,000 in vitro cultured human plasma cells from healthy donors shortly after natural infection with influenza A or vaccination 15 .

Therefore, it is considered essential for a long-lasting, broadly efficacious vaccine to develop the stable population of memory B cells and elicit potent bnAb responses. In this study we characterize a new bnAb 3I14 isolated from memory B cells that binds to the HA stem domain of both group 1 and group 2 influenza viruses.

These B cells were sorted into 384-well plates at the density of one cell per well and cultured in the presence of irradiated CD40Ltransfected cells.

Through this screen, 237 (22.55%) expanded memory B cells were found to secrete Igs that bound to H3 (Table 1) . This in vitro expansion step resulted in a 37-fold increase in H3-reactive B cell recovery compared with 0.61% recovery by sorting plus RT-PCR only (data not shown). The average percentage of cross-reactive clones within the group 2 strains H3/H7 was 18.14%. Remarkably, 13.08 and 8.44% of the H3-binding clones showed hetero-subtypic binding to group 1 H1 strains and H7/H1 strains, respectively. Only 3.38% H3-reactive (H3 \u00fe ) clones were found to also bind influenza B.

We also observed 3I14 induced luciferase reactivity against H5-expressed 293T target cells ( Supplementary  Fig. 6, lower panel) .

The 3I14 variant antibodies were expressed as human IgG1 and their binding affinity against H1, H5 and H3 was evaluated ( Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 7) . Remarkably, 3I14-GL variant still bound H3 and H1 in the nM and sub-nM range while showing a415-fold decrease in binding affinity to H3 and a 4.7-fold increase in binding affinity to H1, respectively ( Table 2 ). These changes in 3I14-GL binding affinity to H3 and H1 were predominantly caused by an increase and decrease in dissociation rate constant (K off ) by 13.9-or 7.5-fold, respectively. Interesting, 3I14-GL did not bind H5 under these assay conditions. Comparing the two chimeric forms to wild-type (WT) 3I14, the SHMs present in both VH and VL of 3I14 appear to make equal contributions to H3 binding (K d : 0.658 nM versus 0.733 nM). In addition, both the heavy and light chain chimeras resulted in essentially irreversible binding to H1 with K off o1.0E-7 s \u00c0 1 . However, in the case of H5, VL mutations contribute more HCDR3 a b c 39 to the affinity increase than VH mutations (7.5-fold versus 1.9fold) due to a 5.2-fold and 2.2-fold decrease in K off , respectively. From these studies we conclude that 3I14-GL shows higher affinity binding to H1 and moderate affinity to H3 with changes in K off being largely responsible for kinetic differences to compare to 3I14-WT. For H5 binding, the SHMs in 3I14 are absolutely required for binding with VL mutations providing a greater contribution to binding than VH changes.

To characterize the molecular basis for unequal binding strengths to H3 and H5 and to engineer 3I14 with improved affinity to H5N1 strains, we first used an antibody structure prediction program BioLuminate 34 for in silico simulation of the 3I14 structure. The superimposition of the 3I14 model with other three IGHV3-30 bnAbs, FI6v3, 39.29 and MAb 3.1, is shown in Fig. 6a . It is clear that the major difference among these antibodies is the conformation of HCDR3 with the exception of the longer LCDR1 of FI6v3 that forms a loop structure which makes contact with HA. Next, the 3I14 model was docked to the H3 trimer structure with RosettaDock server 35 . Since 3I14 competes with FI6v3 and 39.29 for binding to H3 and H5, and MAb 3.1 occupies the same conserved epitope with FI6v3 and 39.29 (ref. 18 ), we hypothesized that 3I14 adopts a similar binding scheme to interact with H3/H5 as FI6v3, 39.29 and MAb 3.1. For these three Ab-HA co-crystal structures, HCDR3 plays a major role in forming a hydrophobic core with the fusion peptide and helix A 15, 17, 18 . Rather than making significant interactions with HA, HCDR1 and HCDR2 appear to stabilize the HCDR3 loop to facilitate binding. The hydrophilic light chain CDR residues also interact with HA and surround the hydrophobic core; however, the orientation of the light chains are not conserved nor are the residues involved in binding. These observations suggest that the light chains mainly contribute to the binding by orienting the HCDR3 to an optimal position to interact with the epitope.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1101, "end": 1104, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1105, "end": 1108, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 414, "end": 421, "text": "Fig. 6a", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "On the basis of these solved co-crystal structures, we chose from 1000 decoys the most similar binding models of 3I14/H3 (Fig. 6b) and 3I14/H5 complexes (not shown).

In addition to H5, the E39 amino acid change is also found in group 1 H2, H6, H11 and H13 strains (Supplementary Table 2 ). Another striking variation is at H3 position L38, where this residue is changed to K/R38 for some group 1 strains (Supplementary Table 2 ).

To examine this structural based modification, we first evaluated the binding affinity of both WT 3I14 and VLD94N variant IgG1. As shown in Table 3 , VLD94N variant increased binding affinity to H5 by nearly 10-fold but did not cause any significant change in binding to H3.

These results demonstrate that the optimized 3I14 VLD94N variant lead to an increase in binding and neutralizing ability to H5 while maintaining its efficacy to H3. Discussion B-cell memory is a second layer of humoral immune defense and is essential for the survival of the host. If pre-existing neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) secreted by long-lived plasma cells are insufficient to bind and eliminate the invading microbe, pathogen-specific memory B cells will rapidly undergo proliferation and differentiation to produce nAbs 24 . Compared with long-lived plasma cells, memory B cells provide broader antibody responses through affinity maturation. In this study, we analysed the cross-reactivity of 237 H3-reactive memory B cells from seven healthy donors and found that 20 (8.44%) also bound H7 and H1 HAs. This H3/H7/H1 hetero-subtypic population corresponds to 46.5% (43 clones) of H3/H7 binding and 64.5% (31 clones) of H3/H1 binding populations (Table 1 ). This broad reactivity represents an unexpectedly high level of hetero-subtypic group 2 and groups 2/1 influenza A binding clones than might be expected based on published plasmablast cell studies 37, 38 . These memory B-cell frequencies are also particularly remarkable since the blood samples were not harvested immediately post seasonal vaccination. Other memory B-cell clones including H3-reactive B cells that cross bind to influenza B, while found at lower levels (3.38%), represent an important finding that requires further evaluation as they may represent an important population to elicit with universal influenza vaccines. 3I14 mAb is the first high-affinity bnAb to be isolated from human memory B cells that has activity against groups 1 and 2 influenza A viruses. Two other IGHV3-30-encoded bnAbs with both group 1 and 2 activities-FI6 and 39.29-were isolated from plasma cells and plasmablasts, respectively 15, 17 . These three examples provide evidence of biased use of a second VH germline gene in the generation of bnAbs beyond IGHV1-69 for which such preferential use has now clearly been demonstrated 29, 39, 40 . The IGHV3-30 germline gene has 19 alleles and we are able to make tentative assignments of 39.29 (ref. 17) and MAb 3.1 (ref. 18 ) to IGHV3-30*01, while FI6 (ref. 15 ) and 3I14 to IGHV3-30*03. There are a number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the coding region of the IGHV3-30 alleles that result in amino acid changes but only one CDR residue at position 33 in HCDR1 has A/G variance among the alleles. On the basis of three crystal structures and our 3I14 modelling, position 33 does not appear to be directly involved in HA binding. Whether variable levels of IGHV3-30 Abs exist in the expressed Ab repertoires of individuals that encode different IGHV3-30 alleles due to variances in the noncoding regions that may affect transcription/recombination will require additional investigations to answer.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 983, "end": 985, "text": "24", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1616, "end": 1619, "text": "37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 2342, "end": 2345, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2541, "end": 2544, "text": "29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2545, "end": 2548, "text": "39,", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 2645, "end": 2660, "text": "39.29 (ref. 17)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 132, "end": 140, "text": "(Fig. 7)", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}, {"start": 291, "end": 300, "text": "(Fig. 7a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}, {"start": 442, "end": 451, "text": "(Fig. 7b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}, {"start": 1408, "end": 1416, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "There are notable similarities and differences among the stem-directed bnAbs encoded by IGHV1-69 and IGHV3-30 in their structures, V segment SHMs 39 (Supplementary Table 3 ) and involvement of light chains in binding. The majority of stemdirected IGHV1-69 bnAbs have broad hetero-subtypic binding and neutralization activity against group 1 influenza A strains 29, 39 , although two IGHV1-69 BnAbs-CR9114 (ref. 16) and MAb 1.12 (ref. 19 ) -generated from human-derived phage display libraries have broader activity with groups 1 and 2 activity. For their heavy chains, several studies have shown that IGHV1-69 bnAbs require two anchor residues: F54 in HCDR2 and a properly positioned tyrosine in HCDR3, as well as a hydrophobic amino acid at position 53 and a minimal number of signature mutations in CDR1/2 to generate high-affinity antibodies 29, 39, 40 . In contrast to IGHV1-69-encoded antibodies, IGHV3-30 bnAbs utilize HCDR3 to form a hydrophobic core that contributes to HA binding 15, 17, 18 and possess a longer HCDR3 due to a large amount of N-insertions in the VDJ junctions 15, 18, 29 . For IGHV1-69-encoded bnAbs, F10, CR6261, CR9114 and MAb 1.12, the light chains can be replaced without affinity impairments 12, 13, 19, 40 . A distinguishing feature of 3I14 as well as the other IGHV3-30 bnAbs is that the light chains are important for binding both when in germline configuration and as shown with 3I14 when SHMs are introduced which leads to broadening of its antigenic breadth (Table 2) . Specifically, the 3I14 chiral S31 in VL germline LCDR1 likely applies tension to the binding interface and sequentially changes the coordinates of the main chain ( Supplementary Fig. 2) , which may lead to a failure to provide flexibility for conformational changes on HA binding that could result in fast dissociation rates ( Table 2) . As shown in Supplementary Fig. 9 , this liability is overcome by the G31 substitution in WT 3I14, which leads to strong interactions with Q42 and D46 of H5. Other mutations in the light chain are buried in the interior of the antibody and may not contribute to the binding to HA. Further, our structure-based modification, D94N in LCDR3, also provided the same binding improvement towards H5 (Table 3) . N94 can compensate for the electrostatic repulsive force between E39 in H5 and D94 in 3I14, facilitating the assembly of H5-3I14 complex. This D94N mutation could be generated in somatic B cells in vivo by activation-induced deamination (AID) U:G mismatch repair 41 .

The 3I14 germline reversion lacks binding affinity to H5 but retains its strong reactivity with H3/H1, suggesting the 3I14 clone was selected by high-affinity binding to H3 and/or H1 and the accumulation of SHMs conferred broader neutralizing activity against the H5 subtypes. Therefore, we speculate that in this H5N1 naive donor stochastic rather than an induced process resulted in the acquisition of H5 binding. This observation also builds on classic studies that the diversity of memory BCRs increases by accumulating selectable and unselectable mutations during the antigen recalling responses 42 .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "In summary, the isolation and characterization of 3I14 mAb suggests that memory B cells may continuously undergo intraclonal diversification via accumulation of SHMs to broaden antibody reactivity against divergent influenza viruses. Interestingly, 3I14-like memory B cells could significantly enhance H5 reactivity through SHMs, while at the same time, reduce their inherent higher affinity for H1. To maintain a broader bnAb repertoire against rapidly diversifying seasonal viruses or potentially pandemic viruses, 3I14-like memory B cells are a general pool that we wish to preserve and expand in that they are not terminally committed to any HA subtype; rather they maintain a plasticity potential that can be evoked by minimal additional SHMs. This is supported by our back-mutation studies that show 3I14 GL antibody has broad activity against H1 and H3 subtypes and has the potential to gain broader activity against H5. This is a distinguishing feature from the GL version of plasmaderived FI6 and other bnAbs which greatly loose activity against some subtypes while maintaining strong activity against other subtypes 15, 29 . We propose an improved vaccination strategy that preferentially targets the HA stem may maintain the longevity of 3I14-like and other anti-stem memory B cells. For example, sequential vaccination with chimeric HAs (cHA) may allow these subdominant memory B cells to preferentially expand 43, 44 . Likewise, direct focusing of Ab repertoires on the HA stem domain by vaccination with headless HAs may achieve a similar goal 45, 46 . Additionally, targeting influenza A vaccines to a naive pool of IGHV3-30 B cells that provide strong initial binding energy through their BCR H/L CDR3 motifs may prove useful. These vaccine approaches may have the advantage of preventing the memory B cell loss that is further compounded by HA antigen induced expansion of abundant anti-head memory B cell clones 47, 48 . A different strategy may be to inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway which has been reported to modify the nAb repertoire and increase the frequency of Abs potentially cross-reactive to conserved stem epitopes 49, 50 .
