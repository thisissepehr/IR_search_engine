Estimates from vaccine effectiveness studies performed in the outpatient setting were similarly high [4] . This is consistent with the observation that most subjects (77%) with HAI titers of \u226540 against vaccine strain viruses also had HAI titers of \u226540 to VS-K166Q viruses in our study. It should be noted that a \u22654-fold increase in HAI titer against vaccine strain virus following receipt of 2013-2014 influenza vaccine was only observed in 11% of vaccinated subjects in this cohort with paired serum specimens bracketing vaccination [10] . The H1N1 component of the vaccine has not been updated in several years, and it is likely that many of the individuals in our study had prior A(H1N1)pdm09 infection and/or vaccination. We speculate that vaccine responses could be improved by including a contemporary A(H1N1)pdm09 strain in future formulations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 183, "end": 187, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 291, "end": 294, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 725, "end": 729, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RESULTS"}, {"text": "An HAI titer of 40 has historically been associated with approximately 50% protection against influenza virus infection following exposure [11] .

Although antibody to HA is considered to be the major correlate of protection, antibody to neuraminidase has also been shown to independently correlate with protection against influenza virus infection [12] .

Individuals who volunteered for blood specimen collection for this study were, on average, older, less likely to be vaccinated, and more likely to have had A(H1N1)pdm09 infections than those in the overall cohort who did not volunteer. While we do not expect this to affect the validity of the results, we cannot ensure that the findings are generalizable beyond the study population. Also, we did not collect blood specimens from children aged <13 years, and very few blood specimens were collected from adults aged \u226550 years. Given that antibody responses are affected by past infection and vaccine exposures [13] , the prevalence of antibodies that recognize vaccine strain and VS-K166Q viruses likely varies considerably across age groups.
