These scoring systems were developed using data from trauma patients rather than from patients with an underlying malignancy, and none can be relied upon to predict the death of a lung cancer patient. There are few previous studies assessing predictive factors of death in patients with solid tumors upon admission to the intensive care unit. Previous studies have been limited to the examination of factors affecting the survival of patients with solid tumors and hematologic malignancies during their ICU sojourn. Early predictive factors of intensive care unit death will be useful when the decision regarding admission to an intensive care unit has to be made. We conducted a retrospective study to identify predictive factors of death in patients with primary lung cancer on admission to the intensive care unit.",

In our hospital, all lung cancer patients are eligible for MICU admission. Patients were transferred mainly from the departments of pneumology or thoracic surgery, because there is no intensive care unit in the department of pneumology, and the thoracic surgery department only receives uncomplicated post-operative patients. Data were collected retrospectively from both the MICU records and the referred unit records before MICU admission. For the patients with more than one MICU admission, only the first admission was included in the analysis to assure independence of observations. Demographic data (age, sex, underlying diseases, MICU admitting diagnosis) were recorded for all patients. Other data collected included evaluation of tumor: pathologic subtypes, types and number of metastases, lung cancer staging TNM classification [2] , treatment options from surgical resection and radiation therapy, to chemotherapy. Three indexes were calculated for each patient: SAPS II [3] , based on the worst values of clinical and biological variables within the first 24 hours in the MICU; ODIN score [4] , based on type and number of organ failures on admission; and the Karnofsky performance status. The Karnofsky index, evaluating quality of life, determines the ability of a patient to carry on normal activities in life by using a scale from 0 to 100 %. In this study, it was established within the 15 days preceding admission to hospital.",

A review of the literature reveals mortality rates between 72 % and 90 % for oncology patients requiring mechanical ventilation (MV). However, in a recent study [9] , a 67 % mortality rate is reported for MV patients included in a population in whom nearly half had hematologic malignancies and/or bone marrow transplantation. This is one of the lowest reported mortality rates to date. In the same study, ICU mortality was 48 % in lung cancer patients. These more recent 1814 Fig. 1 Kaplan-Meier overall survival curves for the two groups after hospital discharge. Dotted line indicates median survival time data raise the possibility that newer treatments and ventilatory strategies for MV oncology patients may be leading to improvements in outcome. However, long-term survival after MICU discharge was poor. This is in accordance with the six-month survival rate, which ranges from 20 to 26 %, of patients admitted to the intensive care unit with solid tumor or hematological cancers [10] . In a 5-years survival analysis of 12,180 patients admitted to an intensive care unit [11] , cancer was a strong determinant of a poor outcome in multivariate analysis. In our study, only 14 patients (25 %) survived to be discharged from hospital, and median survival time was 16 weeks for disseminated tumor. In this case, long-term survival after MICU discharge depended exclusively on the severity of the lung cancer, close to the median survival time usually reported to be between 14 and 26 weeks in this category of the cancer population [12, 13, 14] .",

In a retrospective study of 49 cardiac arrests in cancer patients, cardiac pulmonary resuscitation is always successful when cardiac arrest is the consequence of acute drug cardiovascular toxicity, and the majority of these patients survive their hospital stay [16] .

            "text": "For mortality risk stratification in the intensive care unit, several severity indexes are used. These indexes, such as SAPS II and APACHE II [17] , are calculated during the first 24 h. Although these indexes are useful in explaining ICU outcome variance, doubts have been expressed concerning their accuracy when applied to certain subgroups of patients. Thus, APACHE II scoring significantly underestimates the mortality risk in HIV-positive patients admitted to a medical ICU with a total lymphocyte count of < 200 cells/mm 3 , and particularly with regard to patients admitted for pneumonia or sepsis [18] . In a cohort study of patients admitted to the intensive care unit [11] , the reduction of survival was large in patients with cancer even among those pati-ents with a low APACHE II at the time of ICU admission. The general ICU prognosis scoring system consistently underestimates the probability of hospital mortality for cancer patients admitted to an ICU. So, the relative accuracy and predictive abilities of those indexes in patients with lung cancer have yet to be established. In the SAPS II score, where cancer is recorded, the estimate of risk of death could be improved. In our study, SAPS II is a death-predictive factor in univariate analysis (P < 0.05), but not in multivariate analysis. In this population of patients, mortality after MICU discharge could not be accurately predicted with the SAPS II score. In a recent study, Groeger et al. [19] develop a model for probability of hospital survival at admission to the intensive care unit of patients with malignancy. They report a disease-specific multivariate logistic regression model based on 16 variables. More simply, in our study, a Karnofsky performance status of < 70 is a strong death-predictive index in both univariate and multivariate analysis. Performance status is commonly used to predict mortality in cancer patients and is a well-known variable associated with survival duration [12, 20] . For those patients, performance status appears to be a good predictive factor of hospital mortality, and is likely to be a prognostic variable not only of cancer patients.",

The majority of patients with solid tumors and hematological cancers admitted to the intensive care unit die before discharge, or if they survive the hospital admission, they spend a minimal amount of time before dying. This limited survival is achieved at considerable cost [10] . Despite separate educational programs conducted for oncologists and intensivists, the results of a recent study [22] demonstrated that the physician education intervention did not result in a change in the utilization of medical ICU resources by bone marrow transplant patients. Modification of physicians' practice habits remains difficult and requires objective data. We report two death-predictive factors, which should be validated in a prospective study.

Design: Retrospective study from July 1986 to February 1996. Setting: Medical intensive care unit at a university hospital. Patients: Fifty-seven patients with primary lung cancer admitted to our medical intensive care unit (MICU). Measurements and results: Data collection included demographic data (age, sex, underlying diseases, MICU admitting diagnosis) and evaluation of tumor (pathologic subtypes, metastases, lung cancer staging, treatment options). Three indexes were calculated for each patient: Karnofsky performance status, Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, and multisystem organ failure score (ODIN score).Mortality was high in the MICU: 66 % of patients died during their MICU stay, and hospital mortality reached 75 %. In multivariate analysis, acute pulmonary disease and Karnofsky performance status < 70 were associated with a poor MICU and post-MICU prognosis. For the survivors, long-term survival after MICU discharge depended exclusively on the severity of the lung cancer. Conclusions: We confirmed the high mortality rate of lung cancer patients admitted to the MICU. Two predictive factors of death in MICU were identified: performance status < 70 and acute pulmonary disease.",
