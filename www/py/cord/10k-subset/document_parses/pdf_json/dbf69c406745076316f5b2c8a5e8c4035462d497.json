The aims of this study were to investigate if topical povidone iodine (i) inhibits bacterial growth and (ii) disrupts the balance of the oral microbiota. Methods: This randomized controlled clinical trial included 23 patients who underwent mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. The patients were divided randomly into two groups: the intervention group (n = 16) and the control group (n = 7). All patients received oral cleaning with 3% hydrogen peroxide, followed by irrigation with tap water. The patients in the intervention group received 10% povidone iodine applied topically to the oral cavity. The concentration of total bacteria in the oropharyngeal fluid were determined before, immediately after, 1 h, 2 h, and 3 h after oral care using the Rapid Oral Bacteria Quantification System, which is based on dielectrophoresis and impedance measurements. The number of streptococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Candida albicans before, immediately after, 1 h, and 3 h after oral care were estimated based on real-time polymerase chain reaction data. Results: After irrigation of the oral cavity, the number of bacteria decreased, but increased again at 1 h after oral care in the control group; however, in the intervention group, the concentration of bacteria was significantly lower than that in the control group at 1 hour (p = 0.009), 2 h (p = 0.001), and 3 h (p = 0.001) after oral care.

However, their studies were conducted with historical controls. Moreover, it remained unclear whether their oral care procedures actually reduced oral bacteria and how long the effects of oral care lasted. Hayashida et al.

[14] reported that irrigation with tap water reduces oral bacteria in ventilated patients, but the number of bacteria in oropharyngeal fluid increased within 3 h after irrigation. Funahara et al. described that topical tetracycline ointment on the tongue reduces the number of bacteria in oropharyngeal fluid for about 6 h [16] ; furthermore, in a multicenter randomized clinical trial, topical application of tetracycline ointment on the tongue every 6 h for 24 h after surgery significantly prevented surgical site infection in patients undergoing oral cancer surgery with flap reconstruction and tracheotomy [17] . Some studies have investigated the effects of oral decontamination on VAP prevention. Rodriguez-Rold\u00e1n et al. [18] reported that topical application of a paste containing tobramycin, amphotericin B, and polymyxin E in the oral cavity reduced the risk of VAP in 13 ventilated patients, although the overall mortality was not improved. Abele-Horn et al. [19] also reported that the incidence of VAP was reduced by topical administration of that same paste in 58 ventilated patients. Bergmans et al. [20] reported that topical antimicrobial prophylaxis consisting of an orabase paste containing gentamycin, colistin, and vancomycin reduced the risk of VAP in 92 patients. However, these studies failed to demonstrate the effect of topical antibiotics on decreasing mortality rate or hospital day. Furthermore, antibiotic administration may promote the emergence of resistant bacteria; therefore, the topical use of antibiotics is not recommended for mechanically ventilated patients. One meta-analysis has shown that topical 0.12% chlorhexidine is effective in preventing VAP [21] . Although topical application of 0.12% chlorhexidine is a standard procedure in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, its use in the oral mucosa is not approved in Japan because of reports of anaphylactic shock. Similar to chlorhexidine, povidone iodine has antibacterial activity and is approved for use in the oral cavity. However, it is not commonly used to prevent VAP. It has been suggested that povidone-iodine is cytotoxic to normal mucosal cells, and it has been pointed out that prolonged use of Fig. 3 Changes in the total bacterial count before and after oral care in the intervention and control groups. There was no significant difference in the total bacterial count between the 2 groups before and after oral care, but at 1, 2, and 3 h after application of iodine povidone, it in the intervention group was significantly lower than that in the control group povidone iodine may cause tooth coloring. The CDC guidelines 2017 [22] recommend the use of iodine before wound closure during surgery, so we believe that the usefulness of the disinfecting effect outweighs the cytotoxicity concerns. This randomized controlled study showed that topical application of 10% povidone iodine-an alternative to 0.12% chlorhexidine in Japan-after cleaning and irrigation of the oral cavity inhibited bacterial growth in the oropharyngeal fluid of patients on mechanical ventilation while not disrupting the balance of the oral microbiota. The present study showed that povidone iodine reduced the number of oral bacteria for at least 3 h after oral care in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, the results of real-time PCR showed that topical povidone iodine did not disturb the balance of the oral microbiota or promote the growth of bacteria resistant to antibiotics (e.g., MRSA) or fungi. These findings Fig. 4 Changes in the count of each microorganism before and after oral care in the intervention and control groups. Each microorganism decreased at 1-3 h after application of povidone iodine, suggesting that this disinfectant does not disturb the oral microbiota or promote the growth of bacteria resistant to antibiotics (e.g., MRSA) or fungi suggest that topical application of povidone iodine is a simple and safe method to reduce oral bacteria for a longer time that could be used as standard prophylaxis against VAP in Japan-similar to 0.12% chlorhexidine globally.
