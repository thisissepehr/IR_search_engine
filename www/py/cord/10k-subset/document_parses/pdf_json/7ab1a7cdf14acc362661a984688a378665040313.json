Through the use of a normal form coordinate transform, we are able to analytically derive the stochastic center manifold along with the associated, reduced set of stochastic evolution equations. The transformation correctly projects both the dynamics and the noise onto the center manifold. Therefore, the solution of this reduced stochastic dynamical system yields excellent agreement, both in amplitude and phase, with the solution of the original stochastic system for a temporal scale that is orders of magnitude longer than the typical relaxation time. This new method allows for improved time series prediction of the number of infectious cases when modeling the spread of disease in a population. Numerical solutions of the fluctuations of the SEIR model are considered in the infinite population limit using a Langevin equation approach, as well as in a finite population simulated as a Markov process.",

In this article, we present a general theory of stochastic model reduction, which is based on a normal form coordinate transform. This nonlinear, stochastic projection allows for the deterministic and stochastic dynamics to interact correctly on the lowerdimensional manifold so that the dynamics predicted by the reduced, stochastic system agrees well with the dynamics predicted by the original, high-dimensional stochastic system. Although the method may be applied to any physical or biological system with well-separated time scales, here we apply the method to an epidemiological model. We show that when compared with the original stochastic epidemic model, the reduced model properly captures the initial and recurrent disease outbreaks, both in amplitude and phase. This long-term accuracy of the reduced model allows for the application of effective disease control where phase differences between outbreak times and vaccine controls are important. Additionally, in practice, one can only measure the number of infectious individuals in a population. Our method allows one to predict the number of unobserved exposed individuals based on the observed number of infectious individuals.",

The mechanistic modeling side of population dynamics is well known and established. 1, 2 These models typically are assumed to be useful for infinitely large, homogeneous populations, and arise from the mean field analysis of probabilistic models. On the other hand, when one considers finite populations, random interactions give rise to internal noise effects, which may introduce new dynamics. Stochastic effects are quite prominent in finite populations, which can range from ecological dynamics 3 to childhood epidemics in cities. 4, 5 For homogeneous populations with seasonal forcing, noise also comes into play in the prediction of large outbreaks. [6] [7] [8] Specifically, external random perturbations change the probabilistic prediction of epidemic outbreaks as well as its control. 9 When geometric structure is applied to the population, the interactions are modeled as a network. 10, 11 Many types of static networks which support epidemics have been considered. Some examples include small world networks, 12 hierarchical networks, 13 and transportation networks of patch models. 14 In addition, the fluctuation of epidemics on adaptive networks, where the wiring between nodes changes in response to the node information, has been examined. 15 In adaptive network models, even the mean field can be high dimensional, since nodes and links evolve in time and must be approximated as an additional set of ordinary differential equations.",

In the presence of well-separated time scales, a model reduction method is needed to examine the dynamics on a lower-dimensional space. It is known that deterministic model reduction methods may not work well in the stochastic realm, which includes epidemic models. 17 The purpose of this article is to examine a method of nonlinear, stochastic projection so that the deterministic and stochastic dynamics interact correctly on the lower-dimensional manifold and predict correctly the dynamics when compared with the full system. Because the noise affects the timing of outbreaks, it is essential to produce a low-dimensional system that captures the correct timing of the outbreaks as well as the amplitude and phase of any recurrent behavior.",

For a system with certain spectral requirements, the existence of a stochastic center manifold was proven in Ref. 18 . Nonrigorous stochastic normal form analysis \u0351which leads to the stochastic center mani-fold\u0352 was performed in Refs. [19] [20] [21] [22] . Rigorous theoretical analysis of normal form coordinate transformations for stochastic center manifold reduction was developed in Refs. 23 and 24. Later, another method of stochastic normal form reduction was developed, 25 in which any anticipatory convolutions \u0351integrals into the future of the noise processes\u0352 that appeared in the slow modes were removed. Since this latter analysis makes the construction of the stochastic normal form coordinate transform more transparent, we use this method to derive the reduced stochastic center manifold equation. Figure 1 shows a schematic demonstrating our approach to the problem. We consider a high-dimensional system along with its corresponding reduced low-dimensional system. In this article, two types of low-dimensional system are discussed: a reduced system based on deterministic center manifold analysis and a reduced system based on a stochastic normal form coordinate transform. Regardless of the type of low-dimensional system being considered, a common noise is injected into both the high-dimensional and lowdimensional models, and an analysis of the solutions found using the high and low-dimensional systems is performed.",

Also, fluctuations in the birth rate manifest itself as additive noise. Furthermore, as we are not interested in extinction events in this article, it is not necessary to use multiplicative noise. In general, for the problem considered here, it is possible that a rare event in the tail of the noise distribution may cause one or more of the S, E, and I components of the solution to become negative. In this article, we will always assume that the noise is sufficiently small so that a solution remains positive for a long enough time to gather sufficient statistics.

The complete system is solved for U, V, and W, while the reduced system is solved for V and W. In the latter case, U is computed using the center manifold equation given by Eq. \u035117\u0352. Once the values of U, V, and W are known, we compute the values of S, \u0112 , and \u012a using the transformation given by Eqs. \u03517a\u0352-\u03517c\u0352.

Figures 3\u0351a\u0352 and 3\u0351b\u0352 compare the time series of the fraction of the population that is infected with a disease I, computed using the complete stochastic system of transformed equations of the SEIR model \u0353Eqs. \u035120a\u0352-\u035120c\u0352\u0354 with the time series of I computed using the reduced system of equations of the SEIR model that is based on the deterministic center manifold with a replacement of the noise terms \u0353Eqs. \u035122a\u0352 and \u035122b\u0352\u0354.

One can see that the solution computed using the reduced system quickly becomes out of phase with the solution of the complete system. Use of this reduced system would lead to an incorrect prediction of the initial disease outbreak. Additionally, the predicted amplitude of the initial outbreak would be incorrect. The poor agreement, both in phase and amplitude, between the two solutions con-tinues for long periods of time, as seen in Fig. 3\u0351b\u0352 . We also have computed the cross correlation of the two time series shown in Figs. 3\u0351a\u0352 and 3\u0351b\u0352 to be approximately 0.34.

Furthermore, Fig. 5\u0351b\u0352 shows that the reduced system accurately predicts recurrent outbreaks for a time scale that is orders of magnitude longer than the relaxation time. This is not surprising since the solution decays exponentially throughout the transient and then remains close to the lower-dimensional center manifold. Since we are not looking at periodic orbits, there are no secular terms in the asymptotic expansion, and the result is valid for all time. Additionally, any noise drift on the center manifold results in bounded solutions due to sufficient dissipation transverse to the manifold. The cross correlation of the two time series shown in Fig. 5 is approximately 0.98, which quantitatively suggests there is an excellent agreement between the two solutions.",

We have shown that the individual time series does not agree because the noise has not been correctly projected onto the stochastic center manifold. However, by comparing histograms of the probability density p SI of the S and I values, we saw that there was a very good agreement. This is caused by the fact that although the two solutions are out of phase with one another, their range of amplitude values is similar. The phase difference is not represented in the two histograms. This is a real drawback when trying to predict the timing of outbreaks and leads to potential problems when considering epidemic control, such as the enhancement of disease extinction through random vaccine control. 35 To accurately project the noise onto the manifold, we derived a stochastic normal form coordinate transform for the complete stochastic system of transformed equations. The numerical solution to this reduced system was compared with the solution to the original system, and we showed that there was an excellent agreement both qualitatively and quantitatively. As with the first method, the histograms of the probability density p SI of the S and I values agree very well.",

For some generic systems, such as the singularly perturbed, damped Duffing oscillator, either reduction method can be used since the terms in the normal form coordinate transform which lead to the average stochastic center manifold being different from the deterministic center manifold occur at very high order. 17 In other words, the average stochastic center manifold and deterministic center manifold are virtually identical. For the SEIR model considered in this article, there are terms at low order in the normal form transform, which cause a significant difference between the average stochastic center manifold and the deterministic manifold. Therefore, as we have demonstrated, when working with the SEIR model, one must use the normal form coordinate transform method to correctly project the noise onto the center manifold.",

The reduced model captures both the amplitude and phase accurately for a temporal scale that is many orders of magnitude longer than the typical relaxation time. Since sufficient statistics of disease data are limited due to short time series collection, the results presented here provide a potential method to properly model real, stochastic disease data in the time domain. Such longterm accuracy of the reduced model will allow for the application of effective control of a disease where phase differences between outbreak times and vaccine controls are important. Additionally, since our method is general, it may be applied to very high-dimensional epidemic models, such as those involving adaptive networks. From a dynamical systems viewpoint, the reduction method has the potential to accurately capture new, emergent dynamics as we increase the size of the random fluctuations. This could be a means to identify new noise-induced phenomena in generic stochastic systems.",

Therefore, the new approximation of the coordinate transform and its dynamics are given bywhere = \u0349\u0351X , Y , , \u0352\u0349 so that provides a count of the number of X, Y, , and factors in any one term.For the second iteration, we seek a correction to the x coordinate \u0351slow process\u0352 with the formwhere and F are small corrections. Substitution of Eqs. \u0351A6a\u0352 and \u0351A7b\u0352 into Eq. \u0351A1a\u0352 leads toReplacing X\u0408 = \u202b\u05e5\u202cX / \u202b\u05e5\u202c with F \u0353Eq. \u0351A7b\u0352\u0354, replacing \u202b\u05e5\u202cY / \u202b\u05e5\u202c with \u2212Y \u0353Eq. \u0351A6b\u0352\u0354, and ignoring the term \u202b\u05e5\u202c / \u202b\u05e5\u202cX \u00b7 F since it is a product of small corrections gives the equationmust now be solved for F and . As in the first step, we employ principle \u03514\u0352 and keep the evolution equation \u0353Eq. \u0351A7b\u0352\u0354 as simple as possible. However, since the terms \u0351X \u2212 X 3 \u0352 located on the right-hand side of Eq. \u0351A9\u0352 do not contain or Y, these terms must be included in F. Therefore, one piece of F will be F = \u0351X \u2212 X 3 \u0352.The remaining deterministic term on the right-hand side of Eq. \u0351A9\u0352 contains Y. This term can therefore be integrated into .
