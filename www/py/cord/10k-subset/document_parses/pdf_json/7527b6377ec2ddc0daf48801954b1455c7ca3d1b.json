Bazeley and Battle (1940) recorded the isolation of Strep. equi from the eyes of two horses with conjunctivitis. There are, however, to our knowledge no reports of the isolation of any of the several viruses, causing equine respiratory disease, from the eye. Bazeley (1943) established that strangles may be transmitted experimentally by intranasal inoculation of young (4.5-hour-old cultures) of Strep. equi, and these observations were supported by Bryans et al (1964) . Despite this evidence others (see Bryans et al 1964) including Manninger (1949) argued that Strep. equi is a facultative pathogen, which causes strangles in horses secondarily to some predisposing cause which may be either a virus infection, a %onspecific weakening\", such as fatigue, or exposure to adverse weather. Evidence to support the view that viral damage is an essential or sometime antecedent to the development of strangles could have come from the data presented here if there was unequivocal evidence of the development of EH antibodies between the acute (day 0) and convalescent (days 41 and 101) stages of the disease. The data ( Table 2 ) are equivocal.",

It would not be surprising, therefore, if multiple infections with these microorganisms occurred even though each alone may be pathogenic. Sibinovic et a1 (1965) reported the isolation of parainfluenza 3 virus and Strep. equi from a foal with strangles, and our own data provide a further example of a dual infection, namely Strep. equi and EH virus.",
