Babesiosis presents clinically as a malaria-like illness with fever, chills, headache, fatigue with lymphopenia, atypical lymphocytes, mildly or transiently elevated serum transaminases, thrombocytopenia, and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The diagnosis of babesiosis is based on identification of Babesia spp. on a peripheral blood smear. Babesiosis is usually mild in normal hosts, but it may be severe or even fatal in asplenic patients. Pulmonary manifestations are rare in babesiosis, but non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (NCPE) is the most frequent manifestation. NCPE in babesiosis does not appear to be related to the degree of parasitemia or splenic function and its onset may be early or late. NCPE usually resolves rapidly with supportive treatment; it is rarely fatal. Clinicians should suspect NCPE in patients with babesiosis who acutely develop shortness of breath and have chest radiograph findings compatible with acute pulmonary edema without cardiomegaly or pleural effusions.",

Babesiosis is characteristically associated with intravascular hemolytic anemia. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly may be present, and an elevated LDH value should suggest the possibility of babesiosis. Lymphopenia is common in babesiosis and atypical lymphocytes may be present. Other commonly reported laboratory abnormalities include mild or transient elevations of serum transaminases and subnormal highdensity lipoprotein levels [9, 10] . Most patients with an intact spleen recover spontaneously. Symptoms are usually more severe in elderly, immunocompromised or splenectomized hosts. The diagnosis of babesiosis is based on epidemiology and clinical findings and on laboratory data including identification of Babesia spp. on peripheral blood smear, specific IgM and IgG antibody responses or polymerase chain reaction. Babesiosis is usually treated with a combination of clindamycin and quinine or atovaquone and azithromycin. In severe cases involving asplenia, exchange transfusions have been used [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .",

In patients with intact splenic function, babesiosis is usually mild; with treatment, it resolves without complications. Pulmonary complications are rare and may be related to fluid overload from exchange transfusions or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. To the best of our knowledge, the case presented here is the most recent of only 16 reported in the literature to date. Our patient was an elderly splenectomized woman whose course was complicated by non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema during her hospitalization. In spite of her asplenic status and the case being complicated by a non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, she made a successful recovery. She had a prolonged course of infection, as evidenced by the slow decline in her LDH level, as well as her hemoglobin and hematocrit levels over time; this was ascribed to her lack of splenic function [8, [16] [17] [18] .",

The mechanism of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema in babesiosis is not well understood, nor is the mechanism of NCPE in malaria known (Table 1) .",

Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema in babesiosis should be considered in patients with babesiosis who acutely develop shortness of breath and have a chest radiograph showing increased interstitial markings in the absence of cardiomegaly or pleural effusions. Ventilator support may be required in severe cases of babesiosis complicated by non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema or, less commonly, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema associated with babesiosis usually resolves rapidly with supportive treatment, unless it is complicated by ARDS. Babesiosis complicated by non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema resolves in up to a week and is rarely fatal [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] .",
