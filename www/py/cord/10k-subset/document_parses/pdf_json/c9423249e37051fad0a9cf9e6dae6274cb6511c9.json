Study identification and selection: Studies were identified through MEDLINE, EMBASE, references in primary and review articles, personal files, and contact with authors. Through duplicate independent review, we selected prospective cohort studies evaluating ICU-acquired neuromuscular disorders. Data abstraction: In duplicate, independently, we abstracted key data regarding design features, the population, clinical and laboratory diagnostic tests, and clinical outcomes. Results: We identified eight studies that enrolled 242 patients. Inception cohorts varied; some were mechanically ventilated patients for \u00b3 5 days, others were based on a diagnosis of sepsis, organ failure, or severe asthma while others were selected on the basis of exposure to muscle relaxants, or because of participation in muscle biochemistry studies. Weakness was systematically assessed in two of the eight studies, concerning patients with severe asthma, with a reported frequency of 36 and 70 %, respectively. Electrophysiologic and histologic abnormalities consisted of both peripheral nerve and muscle involvement and were frequently reported, even in non-selected ICU patients. In a population of patients mechanically ventilated for more than 5 days, electrophysiologic abnormalities were reported in 76 % of cases. Two studies showed a clinically important increase (5 and 9 days, respectively) in duration of mechanical ventilation and a mortality twice as high in patients with critical illness neuromuscular abnormalities, compared to those without.

In one large cohort study of non-selected ICU patients, in which electrophysiologic examination was systematically performed, 76 % had electrophysiologic abnormalities [30] . Summarizing the clinical outcomes in these studies is difficult because the duration and completeness of follow-up was variable and not reported in detail. Duration of paralysis was reported in two studies [27, 30] . In one enrolling patients with acute asthma [27] , the duration of paralysis ranged between 5 days and 6 months, except for two patients with prolonged neuromuscular blockade in whom weakness resolved within 72 h.

Early systematic detection of electrophysiologic abnormalities in ICU patients might have prognostic value, since these abnormalities are associated with a high mortality [30, 31] . However, the difficulty of obtaining electrophysiologic evaluation in ICU patients may preclude this systematic approach in daily practice. The importance of the histologic examination in assessing weakness in the ICU setting also needs to be better understood.

However, establishing the potential contribution of CINMA to weaning difficulty is challenging. Only one study cited here described a correlation between limb and respiratory muscle weakness [25] . Superficial diaphragmatic EMG is unreliable [33] , needle diaphragmatic EMG is risky in ventilated patients [34] , and phrenic nerve stimulation is difficult to perform in many ICUs. These problems may account for the dearth of information concerning the attribution of CINMA to diaphragmatic weakness and delayed liberation from mechanical ventilation. Two cohort studies enrolling patients with MOF reported a comparative mortality between CINMA patients diagnosed on electrophysiologic examination and non-CINMA patients, both of them showing a higher mortality in CINMA patients [30, 31] . Although none of these differences were significant, possibly due to sample sizes that were too small, electrophysiologic diagnosis of CINMA could thus be a risk factor for mortality in ICU patients with MOF. It is not clear whether this finding reflects a higher initial severity of illness in CINMA patients or a specific contribution to mortality.

Among the prognosis studies cited in this review, the inception cohorts were well described, but the patients were identified at different points in the history of their illnesses. Many were evaluated while comatose, precluding careful evaluation of weakness. The duration of clinical follow-up, when mentionned, was variable but tended to be short, precluding long term assessment of function and survival.
