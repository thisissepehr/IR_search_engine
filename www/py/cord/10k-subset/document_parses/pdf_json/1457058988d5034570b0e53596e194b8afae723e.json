Critical questions for predicting disease emergence are: (1) what determines when and where a disease will first cross from one species to another, and (2) which factors facilitate emergence after a successful host shift. In wild primates, infectious diseases most often are shared between species that are closely related and inhabit the same geographic region. Therefore, humans may be most vulnerable to diseases from the great apes, which include chimpanzees and gorillas, because these species represent our closest relatives. Geographic overlap may provide the opportunity for cross-species transmission, but successful infection and establishment will be determined by the biology of both the host and pathogen. We extrapolate the evolutionary relationship between pathogen sharing and divergence time between primate species to generate ''hotspot'' maps, highlighting regions where the risk of disease transfer between wild primates and from wild primates to humans is greatest. We find that central Africa and Amazonia are hotspots for cross-species transmission events between wild primates, due to a high diversity of closely related primate species. Hotspots of host shifts to humans will be most likely in the forests of central and west Africa, where humans come into frequent contact with their wild primate relatives. These areas also are likely to sustain a novel epidemic due to their rapidly growing human populations, close proximity to apes, and population centers with high density and contact rates among individuals.",

Diseases that have recently emerged in humans include SARS, HIV, and swine flu. It is projected that 39.5 million people are currently infected with HIV/AIDS (WHO, 2006) , and in 2007 alone, it was estimated that 18 billion dollars would be needed to prevent future HIV transmission and provide care for those already infected (WHO, 2007) . In wildlife populations, EIDs also have resulted in recent and dramatic declines in mammals (e.g., Ebola in African apes; Walsh et al., 2003 , canine distemper virus in wild dogs and lions; Roelke-Parker et al., 1996) , amphibians (e.g., Chytridi-omycosis fungus in global amphibian populations; Daszak et al., 1999) , insects (e.g., the mite Varroa jacobsoni in honey bees; Oldroyd, 1999) , and birds (e.g., conjunctivitis due to Mycoplasma gallisepticum in passerines; Williams et al., 2002) . Human EIDs originate from multiple sources (e.g., host shifts from animal reservoirs [zoonotics] , evolution of existing organisms, and reemergence due to antimicrobial resistance), are increasing in number, and are globally distributed (Jones et al., 2008) . Although there is not sufficient data to evaluate whether there is a similar trend for increasing frequency of disease emergence in wildlife populations, if similar drivers influence the process of disease emergence we might expect this to be the case (Daszak et al., 2000) . The ability to predict when, where, and within which species pathogens are most likely to emerge is therefore increasingly urgent. Understanding the process of disease emergence will be critical for developing strategies to minimize risk and reduce the high cost of managing outbreaks once a disease has emerged.",

Ecological drivers that favor emergence are most frequently associated with changes in host or pathogen ecology, specifically (1) an increase in host population density and contact rates, (2) environmental changes that effect host quality and demography, and (3) changes in host mobility and behavior. Evolutionary drivers of emergence include high genetic variability in the pathogen population (Morand et al., 1996; Gupta et al., 1998) or a lack of variability in the host (Daszak et al., 2000; Altizer et al., 2003b) .

For example, recent comparative analyses have demonstrated that viruses are the most likely group to cross species boundaries (Cleaveland et al., 2001; Pedersen et al., 2005) , perhaps facilitated by high mutation rates and fast generation times providing the potential to rapidly overcome barriers to infection (Parrish et al., 2008) .

The biogeography of both hosts and pathogens will contribute to the opportunity for cross-species transmission. For natural populations, opportunity for new pathogens may be restricted to neighboring species; however, wildlife trade, invasive species, and domestic animals also may be a source of new pathogens. The ability for a pathogen to infect and be transmitted within the new host species is likely driven by ecological and evolutionary barriers, such as phylogenetic relatedness of the hosts and the evolutionary potential of the pathogen. Lastly, multiple demographic factors will affect the ultimate sustainability and establishment of a pathogen following a host shift, including population density, contact rates, and the rate of spread of the pathogen.",

Close evolutionary relationships among host species might translate into similar immunological responses and lifehistory traits (Pfennig, 2000; Ricklefs and Fallon, 2002; Perlman and Jaenike, 2003) , and hence increase the likelihood of successful cross-species infection. The rate of spread in the new host and the progression through the stages of host shift to sustainable disease emergence will be affected by host and pathogen demographics (step 3, Fig. 1 ), for example, population density, contact rates, and the rate of spread of the pathogen in the new host (R 0 ; number of new cases per infected individual) (Dobson and Foufopoulos, 2001; Fenton and Pedersen, 2005; . Mathematical models of hostpathogen interactions (e.g., traditional SIR-susceptible, infected and recovered-models) indicate that for diseases transmitted in a density dependent fashion (i.e., by direct contact), pathogens will only persist and become established in populations above a critical threshold density (R 0 > 1; Anderson and May, 1992) . Disease emergence may be inhibited at any stage, providing the opportunity for alternative management strategies; unfortunately, this complexity contributes to the difficulty in generating accurate predictive models. In Davies and Pedersen (2008) , we demonstrated a significant relationship between the geographical distribution and evolutionary relatedness of primate host species, and the similarity of their pathogen communities. This relationship reflects both the opportunity for host-host contact (geographic overlap), and the barriers to infection (host biology) (steps 1 and 2, Fig. 1 ). We expand on our previous analysis to explore the potential for future pathogen host shifts and disease emergence within and between wild primates and humans. First, we use the relationship between host relatedness, geographic overlap, and pathogen community similarity to quantify the risk of future host shifts that each species faces. Second, we evaluate how past host shifts between primates might have shaped pathogen communities by analyzing patterns of host specificity. Third, we explore whether the phylogenetic risk of host shifts may have shaped host geographic distributions over time. Finally, we identify regions of the globe where we predict host shifts between nonhuman primates and humans may be most frequent. This analysis provides the first quantitative attempt to assess the risk of pathogens host-shifting to humans from wildlife populations, a critical step toward predicting disease emergence.",

Although the relative importance of co-inheritance versus host-shifts in structuring pathogen communities remains unresolved, experimental cross-infection of fungal pathogens among tropical plant species (Gilbert and Webb, 2007 ) revealed a qualitatively similar relationship between host evolutionary relationships and cross-infection success, to that between host relatedness and pathogen sharing in primates (Davies and Pedersen, 2008) .

Phylogenetic risk of host shifts (PRHS), our metric summarizing the likelihood of pathogens shifting between neighboring hosts, varied considerably across primates (Fig. 2) Fig. 3a ), as expected, given that our metric, PRHS, is a summation of all overlapping primates. The brown capuchin (Cebus apella), with a geographic range extending from Colombia and Venezuela to Paraguay and northern Argentina, has the greatest PRHS (2.96), and overlaps with more than 60 other New World primate species across its large range. Critically, however, phylogenetic risk of host shifts frequently differs even between primates overlapping with the same number of neighbors. For example, Demidoff's bushbaby (Galagoides demidoff) and the white-fronted capuchin (Cebus albifrons) both have geographic distributions that overlap with 53 other primate species, but the former has a PRHS of 0.47, and the latter 2.34. Across primates, our randomization procedure indicates a tendency for PRHS to be greater than predicted from a random draw of neighbors (sign test of the number Figure 3 . a Scatter plot of phylogenetic risk against the number of overlapping species for each primate host.

However, limited data on disease in natural populations, in particular, historical information on when and where a pathogen first moved between host species, has made it difficult to generate predictive models (Hopkins and Nunn, 2007) . In a recent paper, we demonstrated that pathogen community similarity among primate species-pairs was correlated closely with their geographical proximity and phylogenetic relatedness (Davies and Pedersen, 2008) . Close geographical proximity provides the opportunity for host-host contact and hence pathogen transfer, whereas phylogenetic distance might be indicative of the ease with which a pathogen can infect a novel host given the opportunity. In this paper, we extrapolate the observed relationship between pathogen sharing and host evolutionary relatedness to explore the likely frequency of host shifts within communities of primate hosts. We predict that host shifts will be most frequent among co-occurring and closely related hosts. Therefore, the frequency of host shifts will reflect both the geographical distribution of host species across the landscape, as well as the shape of the phylogenetic tree that connects them (Fig. 5) . For example, the white fronted capuchin (Cebus albifrons) overlaps in its distribution with many other New World primates and is nested within the recent New World radiation of capuchin monkeys (genus: Cebus). We predict the risk of cross-species pathogen transmission to be high for this species. In contrast, Demidoff's bushbaby (Galagoides demidoff) is common across central and western Africa, and also overlaps with many other primates in its distribution, but has only few close relatives. We predict intermediate risk of cross-species pathogen transmission for this species. The lowest risk of cross-species pathogen transmission is predicted for evolutionary distinct species in regions of low primate diversity (Fig. 5) .",

We predict that frequent host shifts will increase pathogen species richness and de-crease the proportion of host-specific pathogens per host, as pathogens are shared with an increasing fraction of the host community. However, evaluating pathogen species richness is confounded by sampling artifacts (Altizer and Pedersen, 2008 ; but see Nunn et al., 2003; Lindenfors et al., 2007) , which may vary both taxonomically and geographically (Hopkins and Nunn, 2007) . We therefore focus on variation in host specificity. Although it is possible that a systematic geographic bias in the distribution of pathogen species richness (e.g., as suggested for protozoan parasites; might additionally influence the frequency of host shifts, we do not believe that this trend would be sufficient to affect the strong geographical patterns found here. The results strongly support our hypothesis: primates with many close phylogenetic relatives and geographical neighbors have significantly fewer hostspecific pathogens. This relationship becomes stronger when we exclude viral pathogens, which tend to be less constrained by taxonomic barriers Davies and Pedersen, 2008) . To our knowledge, our study is the first to explore variation in host specificity among within-host pathogen communities across an entire mammalian order. In addition, we suggest that future studies Figure 5 . Representation of the interaction between phylogeny and geography that may determine the frequency of host shifts within host communities. In the maps, warmer colors represent areas with many overlapping species ranges (geographically clumped distributions). In the phylogeny, red branches represent samples of closely related taxa (phylogenetically clumped). We predict the greatest frequency of host shifts will be observed among species which are both phylogenetically clumped (those with many close relatives) and geographically clumped (species with many overlapping neighbors) (top left). Species that are neither geographically clumped nor phylogenetically clumped are predicted to have the lowest risk (bottom right). We expect intermediate risk of host shifts for species that are phylogenetically clumped but geographically dispersed, or geographically clumped but phylogenetically dispersed.",

These findings are important because current estimates indicate that almost 49% of primates are considered threatened (IUCN, 2008) , and infectious diseases, especially those that have resulted from a host shift, have been recognized recently as a significant driver of extinction risk in wild animals (Pedersen et al., 2007; Smith et al., 2006 Smith et al., , 2009 . Primates suffer from multiple threats, including habitat fragmentation and transformation, and direct exploitation (IUCN, 2008) , which may increase susceptibility to disease-mediated declines (Smith et al., 2009) . Direct exploitation through hunting for bushmeat, necessitating frequent contact between humans and wild primates, is already associated with emerging infectious diseases moving to humans (i.e., SIV, Ebola, STLV-1; Wolfe et al., 2005; Nunn and Altizer, 2006) . More recently, there has been increasing awareness of the risk for diseases moving from humans to wildlife populations. In Tai National Park, Ivory Coast endangered chimpanzee populations have suffered dramatic declines from pathogens shared with humans, including three outbreaks from pandemic human viruses (human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) and human metapneumoniovirus (hMPV); K\u00f6ngden et al., 2008) . Significant declines in both chimpanzee and gorilla populations also have been documented across central Africa due to infectious diseases (Leroy et al., 2004) . Ominously, it is likely that current risk scenarios are underestimates, based on limited pathogen sampling, especially in wild primates (Hopkins and Nunn, 2007) .",

Notably, Amazonia is not a hotspot for risks of shifts to humans, despite high primate diversity. New World monkeys diverged from Old World monkeys and apes * 40MYA, hence represent only distant evolutionary relatives to humans. Although our model indicates host shifts from wild primates to humans to be most frequent within central and west Africa, the likelihood of a host shift will be affected by additional factors influencing host-host contact rates. Predicting successful host shifts will therefore require information on these additional factors. In this study, we used the rate at which humans are transforming natural habitat, indexed by human popula-tion growth, as a proxy for encounter rates between wildlife species and their associated pathogens. As human populations grow, encroach into new areas, and transform habitats, we may be at greater risk of contacting new pathogens (Daszak et al., 2000; Dobson and Foufopoulos, 2001; Weiss and McMichael, 2004; Wolfe et al., 2005) . This is of particular concern, given the positive correlation between human population growth and our modeled risk of host shifts (Spearman's R = 0.328, P = 0.049, adjusting degrees of freedom to account for spatial autocorrelation), suggesting that in many parts of central Africa, where host shifts are predicted to be frequent, human population growth also is high.",

In epidemiological models, directly transmitted pathogens are not likely to persist in populations below a critical size threshold (a function of both host and pathogen characteristics; Anderson and May, 1992) . For example, measles is thought to go locally extinct in populations comprising less than 250,000 individuals (Keeling and Grenfell, 1997) . Many host shift events may therefore never become established. However, large population centers in or near areas of rapid human expansion can provide the demographic component necessary to convert a host shift into a global emergence event. Here, we map the distribution of the major human population centers across the globe. Population centers that have the potential to facilitate the emergence of new diseases shifting from wild primates to humans are those in west and east Central Africa, including: Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo; Brazzaville, Congo; and Yaounde, Cameroon to the west, and Kampala, Uganda; Kigali, Rwanda; and Nairobi, Kenya to the east.

            "text": "One shift led to the global AIDS pandemic (HIV-1 group M), and the other resulted in a localized endemic in Cameroon (HIV-1 group N) (Keele et al., 2006) . Although SIV has been found in more than 30 African primate species, chimpanzees are the only species that harbor the strain most closely linked to pandemic HIV-1 (Sharp and Hahn, 2008; Keele et al., 2006) . Recent analysis of HIV-1 group M suggests that several variants were circulating in the 1960s, and molecular analysis now proposes that HIV-1 likely emerged from SIVcpzPtt at the turn of the 20 th century (1902) (1903) (1904) (1905) (1906) (1907) (1908) (1909) (1910) (1911) (1912) (1913) (1914) (1915) (1916) (1917) (1918) (1919) (1920) (1921) but had a period of relatively slow growth during the next 50 years (Worobey et al., 2008) . It is thought that HIV-1 group M was first transmitted to humans from wild chimpanzees in the southwest corner of Cameroon (Keele et al., 2006) , and its establishment and spread was likely facilitated by the rise of cities, specifically Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Leopoldville, Zaire). In 1910, no population centers in the area of the cross-species transmission event were greater than 10,000 people; however, Kinshasa grew rapidly as a trading center and had a population between 100,000-400,000 during the middle of the twentieth century when HIV-1 can be found in human samples (Sharp and Hahn, 2008; Worobey et al., 2008) . Kinshasa is 700 km from the location of the original host shift event; however, it was a key transportation hub through river travel (Sharp and Hahn, 2008) . The successful emergence of HIV occurred in our predicted hot spot areas of high human risk. This example highlights the complex multistage process that drives disease emergence: a region with high risk of shifts to humans; a host shift from our closest relative; delayed emergence after the local growth of the human population at a transportation center.",

            "text": "Whereas human population density and encroachment into new habitats may affect the likelihood of the successful emergence of a primate pathogen into humans, the risk map of human disease emergence also highlights geographic locations where wild primates may be at the greatest risk of contracting human diseases. Many pathogens from humans have been found in wild primate populations (e.g., polio, syphilis, influenza A, and measles) and pose a significant threat to their persistence (Nunn and Altizer, 2006) . Almost half of wild primates face the risk of extinction (IUCN, 2008) and pathogens have been linked to substantial population declines (Formenty et al., 1999 , Leroy et al., 2004 , K\u00f6ngden et al., 2008 ; understanding the patterns driving cross-species transmission and host shifts in wild populations will therefore be crucial for their conservation. Within wildlife populations, ecological factors may be more important in determining rates of crossspecies transmission and host shifts within wild primates. Host life history, ecological niche, feeding and activity patterns, sexual behavior, group size, and territoriality are strong determinants of pathogen transmission rates within a host population (Altizer et al., 2003a; Nunn and Altizer, 2006) , and therefore may be important for determining when and to whom cross-species transmission events are likely to be successful. Although a comprehensive exploration of these ecological factors is beyond our current scope, knowledge of how host ecology is likely to interact with pathogen ecology, host phylogeny, and geography will be key for developing a predictive framework of wildlife disease emergence.",

Primates represent a significant disease reservoir for humans; approximately 25% of zoonotic human EIDs are shared with primate host species; however, other taxa (e.g., bats, rodents, birds, and domestic animals) also pose a threat of host shifts to humans (Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005) . Nonetheless, we suspect that our results, specifically that phylogenetic tree shape and geographic dispersion are likely to affect the phylogenetic risk of a host shift, will likely extrapolate across taxa (see Gilbert and Webb, 2007) . Last, we note that the relationship between pathogen taxonomy, host phylogeny, and host geography may be complex and vary across the different pathogen groups. For example, we might predict a greater frequency of host shifts among more distant relatives for viruses than for helminths, which suggests that the risk of viral emergence may be even greater than predicted in our framework.",

            "text": "Although data on pathogens from natural populations is incomplete, and there may be many factors that affect the likelihood of a host shift, our results suggest that a broad biogeographical approach can help predict cross-species pathogen transmission. By combining information across multiple species and communities, it is possible to detect general trends that are not apparent from single case studies. In contrast with traditional epidemiological studies, our analysis explores macroevolutionary and macroecological patterns in the distribution of pathogens across species and the landscape. Our study makes direct predictions about how much variation is expected in pathogen species richness among hosts and the frequency of which host specific pathogens are likely to be distributed across hosts. Detailed species-specific data on both the presence and absence of a pathogen will be essential for evaluating model predictions and for future analyses.",
