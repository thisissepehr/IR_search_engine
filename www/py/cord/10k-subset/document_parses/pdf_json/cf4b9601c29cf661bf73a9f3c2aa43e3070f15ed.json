            "text": "The Flaviviridae include almost 70 viruses, nearly half of which have been associated with human disease. These viruses are among the most important arthropod-borne viruses worldwide and include dengue, yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis viruses. Morbidity and mortality caused by these viruses vary, but collectively they account for millions of encephalitis, hemorrhagic fever, arthralgia, rash, and fever cases per year. Most of the members of this family are transmitted between vertebrate hosts by arthropod vectors, most commonly mosquitoes or ticks. Transmission cycles can be simple or complex depending on the hosts, vectors, the virus, and the environmental factors affecting both hosts and viruses. Replication of virus in invertebrate hosts does not seem to result in any significant pathology, which suggests a close evolutionary relationship between virus and vector. Another example of this relationship is the ability of these viruses to grow in invertebrate ceil culture, where replication usually results in a steady state, persistent infection, often without cytopathic effect. Yields of virus from insect cell culture vary but are generally similar to yields in vertebrate cells. Replication kinetics are comparable between insect and vertebrate ceil lines, despite differences in incubation temperature. Both vertebrate and insect cell culture systems continue to play a significant role in flavivirus isolation and the diagnosis of disease caused by these agents. Additionally, these culture systems permit the study of flavivirus attachment, penetration, replication, and release from cells and have been instrumental in the production and characterization of live-attenuated vaccines. Both vertebrate and insect cell culture systems will continue to play a significant role in basic and applied flavivirus research in the future.",

The virus particles consist of a ribonucleoprotein core surrounded by a lipid bilayer membrane of host-ceil origin. The virion contains three separate structural proteins: the nucleocapsid or core (C) protein, 13 to 14 kDa; the membrane (M) protein, 7 to 8 kDa; and the envelope (E) protein, 50 to 60 kDa. The positive-sense viral RNA codes for seven additional nonstructural proteins, all of\" which play a role in virus replication (111, 112) . The E protein is the major surface component of the flaviviral envelope. Existing as spikes on the viral membrane, the E protein contains all of the important antigenic determinants responsible for hemagglutination and neutralization and thus plays an important role in immunologic protection from infection. E protein domains are involved in the binding of virions to ceil receptors and probably play a role in intraendosomal fusion at low pH as part of the entry pathway (82) .",

In addition, the importance of cell culture for producing flavivirus diagnostic reagents and developing vaccines for current and future flavivirus health threats is discussed. ECOLOGY Distribution of flaviviruses into ecologic groups closely parallels their organization based on their antigenic characteristics ( Table 1 ). The members of the Japanese encephalitis, Ntaya, Uganda S, and dengue antigenic groups are transmitted by mosquitoes, whereas members of the tick-borne encephalitis and Tyuleniy antigenic groups are predominantly transmitted by ticks. Members of the Rio Bravo and Modoc antigenic groups have no known invertebrate vectors and are probably transmitted directly from infected animal to animal. Blok and colleagues (5) have made a detailed comparison of the nucleotide sequences of a variety of flaviviral polymerase and hehcase-like protein coding regions (NS5 and NS3, respectively). Genetic dendograms prepared from these sequence comparisons suggest that the primary division of the flaviviruses is between those transmitted by mosquitoes and those transmitted by ticks. These observations suggest that the evolution of each of the flavivirus antigenic groups is closely associated with their respective vector species.",

In contrast, most newworm monkeys are susceptible to disease, and epizootics in howler monkeys (Alouatta sp.), spider monkeys (Ateles sp.), and owl monkeys (Aotus sp.) are not unknown.

Over the next 20 to 30 yr, improvements in cell and tissue culture techniques led to many rapid developments in virology, culminating with the landmark study by Enders et al. in 1949 on the growth of poliovirus in cultured cells (31) . These results initiated a series of studies that led to the isolation of a variety of viruses and finally ushered in the modern eta of virology (34) . Quantitative virology also matured at about the same time with the introduction of the cell culture-based plaque assay by Dulhecco in 1952 (27) . The use of cultured cells in the study of the basic biology of viruses has developed only during the last two decades. The ability to propagate viruses in homogeneous cultures of cells and the development of modern molecular biology and electron microscopy paved the way for the observation of virus attachment, penetration, uneoating, transcription, translation, packaging, and escape under controlled conditions. It is the ability to control carefully the environment under which a virus replicates that has led to our current level of understanding of viral biology.",

The availability of continuous insect cell cultures provides the opportunity to study how differences in the biology of vertebrate and invertebrate cells affect the biology of a particular infecting virus. Recent research with a variety of arboviruses suggests that some biological characteristics of a virus are correlated to the host from which the virus was derived (41, 59, 81, 99) . Such characteristics may play an important role in the understanding of the mechanisms for attenuation and virulence at the molecular level, and have only recently begun to be studied comparatively in insect and vertebrate cells.

Growth characteristics of flaviviruses in culture vary between cell type, virus, temperature, laboratory, and even experiment. An excellent review of many of these variables has been compiled (61) . In a typical one-step growth analysis of dengue-2 virus infection of A. albopictus cells, virus is first detectable in cell culture superuatant by 24 h postinfection (PI) (105) . Peak titers develop by 48 h PI, followed by a steady decline in titers through Day 6 PI. In another study, with the same cell line and dengne-3 virus, peak titers were also reached within approximately 48 h, but titers decreased slightly through Day 10 PI, at which time a steadystate persistent infection was established. Over the 42 days the cells were monitored, there was little change in the titer of infectious virus from culture superuatant (Fig. 3) (20) .",

In addition, these cell lines are often more desirable in epidemiologic field studies where carefully controlled laboratory conditions are diflicuh to maintain. Most insect cells used in flavivirus research are extremely hardy. They can be maintained in a wide range of temperatures and will survive for short periods under relatively severe temperature extremes. C6/36 cells, for instance, have been maintained in our laboratory for several days at temperatures as low as 4 \u00b0 C and as high as 42 \u00b0 C. Cell husbandry of well-established insect cell lines is often less regimented than that with vertebrate cell lines. In our laboratory, C6/36 cells can be maintained at 27 \u00b0 C for as long as 2 wk postconfluency in the absence of a medium change. All of these characteristics illustrate the utility of insect cell culture for use in field studies under less than optimal conditions. Although virus isolation and identification are standard techniques for flavivirus diagnosis, they are not always possible due to the laboratory conditions required to grow and maintain most cell cultures. Under these conditions, serologic tests are used to diagnose disease by the identifying virus-specific antibodies from patient sera. These techniques also play the major role in epidemiologic studies. Rapid serologic assays, such as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), require a supply of high-quality viral antigen. This has traditionally required the production of large amounts of infectious virus, usually under stringent bioeontainment conditions, followed by some form of virus inactivation, which may or may not lead to alteration of immunologically important viral antigens. With the recent development of baculovirus expression systems, the production of large amounts of viral antigen produced in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) and other insect cells in biocontainment-free environments has become possible. In this system, Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (baculovirus) can be genetically altered to express unusually high levels of foreign gene products when the gene is inserted into the baculovirus polyhedron gene (69, 77) . Utilization of this technique to produce large amounts of flavivinas antigen to be used in diagnostic tests may ultimately reduce the need for containment facilities in diagnostic laboratories.",

Fusion takes place either at the plasma membrane (herpesviruses, retroviruses, and paramyxoviruses) or in endocytic vesicles after uptake by receptormediated endoeytosis (rhabdoviruses, orthomyxoviruses, bunyaviruses, coronaviruses, and togaviruses). Although it is generally accepted that the initial interaction of flaviviruses with cells is a virusreceptor interaction, the phenomenon separate from fusion has not been thoroughly studied. In contrast, viral fusion has been well studied with flaviviruses, although not without some controversy. Many investigators have provided considerable evidence that flaviviruses are taken up by vertebrate cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis followed by a pH-dependent fusion event (38, 39, 62, 86) F1G. 5. Entry of WNV into P388D1 ceils by adsorptive endocytosis at pH 8.0 a, Single virus particles, labeled with several gold particles, attached to cells; b, coated invagination of the plasma membrane endocytosing virus particles labeled with a single gold particle; c, coated vesicle containing a single virus particle. Bar = 100 nm. ]Reproduced from ref (62) with permission.] (Fig. 5 ). More recent research has shown that fusion of dengue, yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis viruses may in fact involve fusion of virus directly to the cell's plasma membrane (52, 108) . In these studies, fusion of mosquito-passaged virus to both C6/36 cells and human peripheral blood monocytes was observed by electron microscopy to occur in the absence of endosome formation. The authors suggest that a more accurate reproduction of natural transmission cycles by passing virus through mosquito cells is required before viral fusion activity in target vertebrate cells can be accurately assessed. The method of infectious flavivirus internalization is likely to prove to be cell specific and to rely heavily on specific viral envelope components that vary considerably, depending on the host cells from which the virions originate.",

The flavivirus genome consists of one single-stranded RNA molecule of positive polarity with a type 1 cap structure at the 5' terminus (14) . The genome is approximately 11 kilobases long and does not typically possess a polyadenylated sequence at the 3' terminus, but instead possesses a sequence that has the potential to form secondary structure. Mandl et al. (72) identified a 3' terminal polyadenylated sequence on the central European encephalitis virus genome, suggesting that 3' polyadenylation may be a characteristic of at least some flaviviruses. The full-length tlavivirus genome is the only mRNA species found in virus-infected cells and encodes 10 proteins which are expressed from the polycistronic RNA to produce a polyprotein that is co-translationatly and posttranslationally processed (14) . Virion RNA also serves as the template for the production of viruscomplementary RNA (vcRNA), which subsequently serves as the template for the production of viral (positive sense) RNA. The genome organization places the coding sequences for the three structural proteins, capsid (C), precursor-membrane (prM)/membrane (M), and envelope (E), at the 5' end of the RNA followed by the coding sequences for the seven nonstructural (NS) proteins; NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5 (14) (Fig. 6) .",

Excellent reviews on this subject have been published (14, 100, 107) . Briefly, proteolyric cleavage points in a number of flavivirus polyproteins have been identified by N-and C-terminal sequencing of individual viral proteins produced in infected cell culture. In addition, a number of flavivirus genomic sequences have been determined and their deduced amino acid sequences have been compared. Amino acid sequences of all flaviviruses are highly conserved immediately adjacent to their predicted or known polyprotein proteolytie cleavage sites. This observation of sequence conservation suggests a common pathway for the proteolytic processing of viral proteins of all flaviviruses. Both cellular and viral proteases are known to be specifically involved in viral protein processing. At least one additional, unidentified protease is also involved in flavivirus protein processing (14) .",

Production of flavivirus particles in infected cells occurs rapidly, less than 12 h PI; and whole particles are associated with perinuclear cisternae of endoplasmic reticulum vesicles (9, 85) . Viral nucleocapsids have not been detected within infected cells (9, 14) . Therefore, rapid nucleocapsid assembly and membrane association are supported. An excellent review of virion assembly and maturation in infected cells and a model suggesting virus cis-and trans-aeting elements and the order of events in the process are described by Chambers et al, (14) . Subcellular transport of immature flavivirus to the cell surface is thought to occur by the translocation of immature virion-containing vesicles from membranous components of the cell to the plasma membrane. Lipid fusion then occurs between the vesicle and the plasma membrane, thus releasing vesicle contents extracellularly (Fig. 8) . Concurrent with tlavivirus translocation and release from cells, a proteolytic cleavage event takes place in which the aminoterminal portion of the preM protein is released forming the mature M protein (9, 14) . This proteolytic event is required to produce fully infectious flavivirus particles (113) . Recent studies on selected flaviviruses suggest that the processing of preM to M is a pH-dependent event, which takes place in post-golgi acid vesicles. This proteolytic event may be necessary for fusion of virus with susceptible cells (43, 94) . Some flaviviruses may, however, be released from infected cells predominantly in the immature form (43) . Additional factors may be involved in the cellular release of the immature flavivirions.",

These techniques are being developed in an effort to define genetically flavivirus elements that are responsible for viral infectivity, enzymatic activities, viral pathogenesis, host range and tissue tropisms, latency, and attenuation (95) . Two examples of the use of this technology with flaviviruses have been described. Rice et al.

The earliest human vaccines to protect against flavivirus infections were inactivated virus vaccines prepared by passing virulent virus in mouse brains, then treating them with formalin. Such mouse brain-derived vaccines against yellow fever and TBE viruses were effective at preventing disease in immunized individuals. Although such vaccines were effective, severe reactigenicity and rapid decay of protective immunity were common, resulting in the need to develop improved vaccines. In 1937, Theiler and Smith (110) reported that neurovirulence of yellow fever virus for monkeys could be reduced by passing the virus in cultured cells. This observation initiated research resulting in the development of a series of live-attenuated flavivirus vaccines. Vaccines derived from in vitro passage of flavivirus continues to be the major source of safe and effective vaccines.",

The 17D vaccine strain dates back to a 1927 isolate of yellow fever virus from the blood of a young Ghanian named Asibi (106) . The virus isolate bearing the name of the donor was subsequently passed 53 times in rhesus monkeys and intermittently in A. ae~ypti mosquitoes. The virus was then passed 18 times in minced mouse embryo tissue culture, 50 times in minced whole chicken embryo tissue culture, 152 times in minced chicken embryo without central nervous system (CNS), and 14 times in chicken embryo with or without CNS. Somewhere between in vitro Passages 89 and 114, a marked change in monkey virulence occurred, eventually leading to the present 17D vaccine (3, 45) . Differences in the deduced amino acid sequences of the Asibi and 17D yellow fever viruses concentrate in the E, the M, NS2a, and NS2b proteins (44, 45) . Amino acids in the NS2 proteins are not highly conserved among flaviviruses, and substitutions within these proteins are thought not to have a significant effect on their function (44) . Identification of critical regions of the flavivirus genome responsible for attenuation has yet to be absolutely identified, but these observations suggest that structural coding regions are probably important. Similar studies with other arboviruses con-firm that structural proteins play an important role in virus attenuation (21, 40) . The availability of a full-length infectious clone of 17D virus may allow identification of specific coding changes that account for attenuation of this strain (95) . It is possible that systematic nucleotide substitutions into the 17D infectious clone may provide positive information on sequences that contribute to yellow fever virus virulence.",

Analysis of the HeLa cell-passed virus suggests that attenuation is due to a genetic change in the virus population rather than to selection of a preexisting variant of Asibi virus. Based on changes in the reactivity of monoclonal antibodies with the parent and attenuated variant, the results suggest that antigenic changes in the viral envelope protein may also play a role in attenuation of the virus (4).",

Proteins prepared in baculovirus expression systems have been used to prepare antigens suitable for vaccination. Most notable is the preparation of a human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV1) subunit vaccine from recombinant baculovirus expressed HIV1 antigens (97) , which is currently being tested in humans. Recombinant baculovirus-expressed flavivirus proteins have been evaluated for their use as vaccines and can protect appropriate animal models against homologous virus challenge (23, 78) . Although this expression system has the potential to express recombinant proteins to extremely high levels in cell culture, the problems involved with protein purification currently limit their use in humans.",

Although the importance of cell culture systems for the study of infectious diseases cannot be overstated, the limitations of these systems must also be understood. Flavivirus infection of animal hosts is an extremely complex event. Complex organisms are made up of a large number of tissues, each tissue containing many cell types. Each cell type has a different biology reflected by its different functions. In vitro, research of flavivirus infection is conducted most often in clonal populations of cells derived from a single tissue type. Very often the biological, morphologic, and genetic characteristics of the cultured cells bear little resemblance to those of the cells of the original tissue. Like the cultures used in these studies, the biology of flaviviruses in cultured cells may boar little resemblance to the biology of the viruses in functioning tissues and organs. As a result, studies on llavivirus biology conducted in cultured cells must be viewed only as a model representing a single event in the complex process contributing to the pathogenesis of viral disease. Cell culture should be used as a tool for studying viral biology in animals and not as a total replacement for studies utilizing intact hosts. With these limitations in mind, further research on flavivirus biology, pathogenesis, ecology, and epidemiology utilizing mammalian and invertebrate cell cultures should be used to enhance our understanding of these viruses at the molecular, microscopic, and organismal levels.",

An understanding of the basic biology of these viruses in the cells of the invertebrate host is essential to establishing control at the level of the arthropod vector. Such research with flaviviruses is under-represented and is required for a thorough understanding of these viruses in nature.",

            "text": "Persistent infections of several mosquito cell lines with St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus have been observed and are characterized by a relatively high proportion of cells infected and a lack of overt CPE. Unlike dengue virus in A. albopictus cells, titers of SLE virus slowly decrease over time in persistently infected cells (93). These data suggest that there may be significant differences in the regulation and maintenance of persistent flavivirus infections in cell lines of different origins. Persistent infection of insect-borne flaviviruses in insect cell cultures is consistent with the ecology of these viruses in nature. Mosquitoes or ticks infected with virus, either through horizontal or vertical transmission, are infected for life. Such viral infections do not seem to significantly affect survival or activity patterns, although this is presently open to debate. The study of persistence in insect cell culture may provide some insight to the mechanisms for viral persistence in natural transmission cycles, and in the understanding of the effect of such infections on cells and tissues of the invertebrate vector. Unlike mosquitoes or ticks, cells and tissues of the vertebrate hosts typically exhibit marked pathology upon infection, resulting in host disease and occasionally death. Host survival is a result of viral clearance associated with humoral or cellular Fluctuation of cxtraccllular dcngue-I virus fiters in persistently infected TRA-171 cell cultures infected with laboratory adapted (Hawaii) or unadapted (H-23334) virus strains. [Modified from ref. (64) with permission.] responses or both. Persistence of flavivirus infection of vertebrate hosts has not been reported, yet persistent infection of vertebrate cells in culture has been described. Such infections may arise as a result of a genetic modification of the virus, such as temperature sensitivity or defective interference (10,66,91). Because defective virus should be eliminated from natural transmission cycles by natural selection, processes leading to persistence in cultured vertebrate cells probably do not play a significant role in natural infection of vertebrate hosts. The availability of a diversity of data on flavivirus replication kinetics and characteristics in insect cultures increases their potential for use in the isolation and ilentifieation of flaviviruses. The type of cell used for isolation is highly virus specific. Singh and Paul (102) first reported the usefulness of A. albopictus cells for the isolation of dengue viruses. The susceptibility of the C6/36 clone of Singh's A. albopictus cells to flavivirus infection was documented (56). Kuno et al.",

Historically, such outbreaks have occurred in the presence of large populations of the container-breeding mosquito, A. aegypti, combined with the introduction of sylvatic virus and a large susceptible human population. Since the 1940s, mosquito control measures have regulated and even extirpated vector populations. A. aegypti eradication efforts in tropical America resulted in the disappearance of urban yellow fever since 1942. Within the last decade however, A. aegypti has reinvaded geographic areas where sylvatic yellow fever occurs, suggesting that future urban outbreaks in the Americas is possible. The officially reported human cases of yellow fever in Latin America are associated with exposure to infected Haemagogus mosquitoes and do not represent true urban virus ecology. In Africa, on the other hand, large urban epidemics have occurred regularly in recent de-FIc. 1. Transmission cycles of yellow fever virus in Mriea, showing the relationship to vegetational zones. Virus is maintained enzootically in the rainforest zone by A. africanus transmission between susceptible monkeys. Human infections occur, but in an endemic pattern due to low vector populations (see text for exception). In the moist savannahs, a variety of sylvatic vectors can cause intermittent epidemics, with monkeys or humans or both serving as intermediate hosts. In the dry savanna zones, container-breeding Aedes may be responsible for interhuman spread. [Reproduced from ref. (83) with permission.]",

Although variation in the yields and temporal appearance of virus are evident in this study, the same investigators also reported that replication kinetics of virus in A. albopictus cells and in vertebrate cells were similar, which indicated that phylogenetic relationships may not correlate well with virus replication kinetics",

A, one virion each (large arrowheads) is seen on the cell surface and in the lumen of a vacuole (II). One virion (small arrowhead) is recognizable within a vesicle in the peripheral cytoplasm. The rest of the virus particles are seen within the cisternae in the cytoplasm. Bar = 100 nm. B, virus particles (arrowheads) within vesicles beneath the plasma membrane (PM). Bar = 100 nm. C, a virus particle (arrowhead) on the cell surface. Note the clean separation between the viral envelope and the plasma membrane. Bar = 100 nm. [Reproduced trom ref.

Vaccinia virus has been developed as a live, infectious expression vector for foreign genes inserted into nonessential virus genome sequences(70,71,84,88).Recombinant vaccinia viruses that express flavivirus proteins have been produced and evaluated by numerous investigators in an effort to develop alternative flavivirus vaccines(6,8,24,32,46,47,76,80,89,90,92,116,119). Evidence of protection against a homologous virus challenge is demonstrated in most cases when animals are immunized with vaccinia recombinants expressing selected structural or nonstructural proteins.In another system, Jacobs et al.(58) have successfully cloned the TBE virus nonstructural protein gene, NS1, into adenovirus under the control of the powerful cytomegalovirus major immediate-early promotor. Under these conditions NS1 is produced in extremely large quantities in cells that do not normally support adenovirus replication. Mice intmunized with the recombinant adenovirus are protected from lethal TBE virus challenge.",
