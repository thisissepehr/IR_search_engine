If the titer from sera taken before the rotavirus season was <50 and the sera taken after the rotavirus serum showed no plaques at a serum dilution of 1:50 (titer,~1:150), a threefold or greater increase in titer was demonstrated. When 573 preseason titers were >50, both pre-and postseason sera were titrated to PRN endpoint.

The fact that WC3 vaccine is heterotypic to human rotaviruses may represent an advantage, because homotypic antibody or immune memory capable of inhibiting an active immune response to WC3 vaccine is unlikely to be present.

Nevertheless, it is likely that tests for serum antibody to rotavirus serve as useful indicators that an immunizing antigenic stimulation of the host has occurred: induction of very low rates of serum antibody response to RIT 4237 vaccine in two African trials was associated with ineffective protection against clinical disease [21, 22J. The serum antibody response of symptomatically rotavirus-infected infants who received placebo tended to be more serotype specific than that observed in vaccinated infants. By far the highest incidence (13 of 14) of PRN antibody responses was noted with serotype 1 rotavirus, and the PRN antibody response to serotype 1 was invariably of higher titer than that to other serotypes, an observation confirming the identification of serotype 1 as the cause of most infections, as previously determined by examination of virus in stools. Five of eight originally seronegative infants, however,responded to the serotype 1 infection with an additional PRN antibody response to serotype 3 rotavirus, and two were found to have developed PRN antibody to serotypes 1,2, 3, and 4. This observation is in agreement with experimental results indicating that orally inoculating experimental animals with rotavirus often results in a serum PRN antibody response that is much more broadly cross-reactivethan that obtained after parenteral inoculation [52, 53J. It is clear from studies with Clark et al. reassortant rotaviruses that the immune reaction to oral immunization includes an efficient response to serotype-specific antigenic determinants located on the rotavirus surface protein vp3 [54, 54aJ; serotype cross-reactive antigenic determinants have been determined to be selectively localized on vp3 [55-57J. The frequent serotype cross-reactive PRN antibody responses of infants to a presumably monotypic rotavirus infection [58, 59J suggest that attempts to determine the relative importance of different rotavirus serotypes by serological surveys [2J must be interpreted with caution.

An unexpected observation was the fact that infants who failed to generate a PRN antibody response to WC3 vaccine were also selectively resistant to naturally acquired rotavirus infection, a difference that was statistically significant (P< .01). Because epidemiological surveys have uniformly demonstrated that all infants become seropositive by two or three years of age [1, 2], these originally \"refractory\" infantswill presumably become infected and develop an antibodyresponse duringsubsequent rotavirus seasons. This observation may provide justification for routinely administering a second booster inoculation of rotavirus vaccine to infants before their exposure to a second rotavirus season.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "It is of interest that in the current study of a middle-class suburban population, we observed, in a single winter season, 25070 occurrence of clinical rotavirusdisease in control infants in the first year of life. Twenty percentof placeborecipients experienced rotavirusillness categorized as moderate to severe. Fifty-five placebo recipients experienced a total of 81 d of rotavirus-associated illness, compared with only 12 d of rotavirus illness in 49 WC3vaccinated infants. Theseobservations suggest that immunization againstrotavirus gastroenteritis may be justifiedon the basisof cost effectiveness as well as of purelymedical considerations, evenin a population of infants from the middle class of a developed nation.
