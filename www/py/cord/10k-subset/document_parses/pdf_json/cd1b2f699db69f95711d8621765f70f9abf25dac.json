The study site presented austere testing conditions. Field-collected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes spiked with inoculated A. aegypti mosquitoes and individual and pooled, field-collected, A. aegypti, A. albopictus, and Culex tritaeniorhynchus mosquitoes were used for RT-PCR assay evaluations. For dengue virus-inoculated A. aegypti mosquitoes and spiked samples, in vitro sensitivity and specificity results for all five assays were concordant with indirect fluorescent antibody assay results. A single pool of field-collected, female, A. aegypti mosquitoes was identified as dengue virus positive. Cross-reactivity was not observed across heterologous serotypes, mosquito vectors, or human DNA. The limit of detection was \u03fe7 to \u054570 genomic equivalents. Sample processing and analysis required \u03fd2 hours. These results show promise of field-formatted RT-PCR reagents for rapid, sensitive, specific dengue virus screening and serotype identification in mosquitoes under field-deployed conditions.",

            "text": "Over the past two decades, dengue fever (DF) and the potentially fatal forms of the disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome, have become increasingly frequent and pervasive and now represent the most significant mosquito-borne viral disease in tropical and subtropical regions globally. 1, 2 Vaccines in development show promise; however, approval is not anticipated in the near future. 3, 4 The current method of prevention is vector avoidance. 5, 6 Vector surveillance is required in assessment of DF transmission risk, and identi-fication of circulating serotypes, with epidemiological history of causative serotypes in previous outbreak situations, is fundamental to DHF/dengue shock syndrome risk assessment. 5 DF is caused by infection with dengue virus. Dengue virus exists as four serologically and genetically distinct serotypes, transmitted to humans by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. 5, [7] [8] [9] [10] Dengue virus surveillance is restricted by limitations in analytical and operational capabilities. Immunoassay-based testing can take \u05461 week, and the results are ambiguous because of cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses. 11, 12 Highly sensitive and specific dengue virus screening and serotype 1 to 4 reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays currently exist but are for use with laboratory-based instrumentation and require \u03ea20\u00b0C cold-chain resources for transportation and storage. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Surveillance conducted under austere field conditions presents logistical and operational constraints that make it impractical to transport, store, and prepare cold-chain-maintained reagents. Unknown variations in PCR enzyme activity and positive-control nucleic acid template integrity result when cold-chain resources are inadequate. Commercially available, field-validated, PCR instrumentation and sampleprocessing reagents fulfill a fundamental requirement in establishing a deployable pathogen identification system. However, development of field-sustainable PCR reagents and positive-control nucleic acid template is essential for the realization of an omnipotent platform. In this work, we describe laboratory and field evaluations of freeze-dried, thermally stable, hydrolytic enzyme-resistant, RT-PCR reagents and positive-control RNA template for rapid dengue virus screening and serotype identification in mosquitoes under austere field conditions.",

Master mixture reaction solution was prepared by adding 36 L of hydration solution (1:1, v/v, PCR-grade water and 2\u03eb reconstitution solution) to each master mixture vial and dispensing 18-L volumes into optical capillary tubes. To each capillary tube, 2 L of nucleic acid extract was added from each sample (or 2 L of PCR-grade water for Armored RNA-dengue virus positive-control and notemplate control assays). Capillary tubes were placed in a tabletop centrifuge and centrifuged for 2 to 3 seconds at 3,000 rpm, to drive the reaction mixture to the bottom of the capillary. Master mixture components consisted of forward and reverse primers, TaqMan probe, 25, 26 dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, Mn(A0c), Tth polymerase, and proprietary 5\u03eb RT buffer (Idaho Technology). The master mixture composition of each assay was previously described. 22 A standardized, RT-PCR, thermal cycling protocol was established, consisting of a RT step at 60\u00b0C for 20 minutes, followed by an initial cDNA denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 2 minutes and PCR for 45 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 0 seconds of template denaturation and 60\u00b0C for 20 seconds of combined annealing and primer extension.

The finding that the DEN-3 assay failed to report a single dengue 3 virus-inoculated A. aegypti mosquito does not imply degradation of fieldformatted reagents but indicates experimental error, because the performance of the assay system was highly sensitive and specific, based on overall test panel results. In the only village with a DF-diagnosed individual of the three collections sites, a single pool of female A. aegypti mosquitoes was identified as dengue virus positive with the dengue virus universal assay. The observed infection rate was consistent with published results. [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] The Armored RNA-dengue virus positive-control samples consistently demonstrated fluorescence. The LOD of the dengue universal assay was \u05451 log unit of target template. The mean C t of samples tested with the screening assay showed that the LOD was 3 log units more sensitive than required for identification of dengue virus-infected mosquitoes. We cannot relate the LOD to potential efficacy in human diagnostic tests, because the concentration of dengue RNA in DF/DHF patient samples and the correlation between copy number and plaqueforming units have not been established. We have a study underway to quantify in vitro sensitivity with dengue virus-infected serum samples.

Purified RNA extracts from cultures or in vitro transcripts are typically used but must be maintained and handled meticulously, because of the inherent fragility of single-stranded template. Challenges in RT-PCR assay sensitivity quantification have been previously discussed. 13 In this work, Armored RNA-dengue virus was used as the quantitative standard for LOD determination. As in nature, a protein coat (synthetic MS2 bacteriophage coat protein) protects RNA from degradation. 23 Upon heating in the RT step of the RT-PCR, the protein \"armor\" is removed and RNA is immediately synthesized into cDNA, providing a stable template from RT through PCR. Armored RNA stability provides promise for the development of real-time quantitative assays. 24 The ability to temporally monitor virus titers has profound implications in vaccine testing. Armored RNA currently has a quantitative application as an internal control. Studies have shown that, by adding Armored RNA to mosquito vector homogenates and patient body fluid and stool samples, the efficiency of the nucleic acid preparation process and each step of the RT-PCR can be monitored quantitatively. [32] [33] [34] [35] Sample processing was simplified by using a commercially available nucleic acid extraction kit. We chose the kit because of its preformatted composition and uncomplicated protocol, but we found additional advantages. The AVL buffer has been shown to inactivate virus. 36 The significance of rendering specimens noninfectious during handling and processing under austere field conditions and low-level containment cannot be overstated. Moreover, preliminary testing indicates that dengue virus genomic RNA remains stable in AVL buffer at ambient temperatures (25-37\u00b0C) for days to weeks. Once fully validated in stability studies, this should facilitate sample handling, in terms of cold-chain requirements. With respect to technology transfer in the context of logistics and training, a single protocol is applicable for RNA and DNA genomes, because total nucleic acid is extracted.",
