However, the high incidence of sterile abscess formation at the site of injection and the finding that hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias are not encountered more often with intravenous administration led to a preference for slow intravenous infusions (Mallory et al. In the 1960s the development of cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) changed treatment strategies. It appeared to be as effective as pentamidine but was associated with a much lower incidence of adverse drug reactions.

Most investigators now feel that cotrimoxazole has no advantage over pentamidine as a first-line treatment for PCP in AIDS patients . Recently a number of other regimens have been advocated by various centres as efficacious against P. carinii (table   I; figs 1 and 2) . These include pentamidine (pentamidine isethionate) administered as an aerosol, oral dapsone-trimethoprim, eflornithine (DFMO ; difluoromethylornithine), trimetrexate and calcium folinate (folinic add), and clindamycin plus primaquine. Although all regimens show reasonable effectiveness, a range of toxicities is often encountered. The major features of each regimen are discussed briefly below. treatment of PCP, and is commonly used as firstline therapy either intravenousl y or orally. The duration of treatment is 14 to 21 days, depending on the severit y of the episod e. Adverse reactions are common with cotrimoxazole, necessitating drug withdrawal in up to 50% of patients (Wharton et al. 1986 ). The major adverse effects include nausea and vomiti ng, rash , fever, bon e marrow suppression (in 20 to 50% of pat ients ), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (rare) and hepatotoxicity. Some centres prefer intravenous administration rather than oral in the belief that there may be less nausea. It is becoming quit e clear that a number of the toxiciti es associated with cotrimoxazole, such as nausea or haematological toxicity, are dose related and that mon itoring drug Drugs 42 (4) 1991 concentrations and dose reductions may redu ce toxicity ). For man y centres, however, monitoring drug levels is not possible and as newer regimens appear to be as effective many physicians readily change to alternative therapy. Besides changing drugs, man y physicians are trying to decrease cotrimoxazole toxicity by either starting treatment with lower doses (960 rug/day trimethop rim, 4800 rug/day sulfame tho xazole) or decreasing treatment courses from 2 1 to 14 days. Some centres are able to maintain certain patients on cotrimoxazole throughout a full treatment course by 'treating through' any hypersensitivity reactions that occur or by desensitising the patient to the drug (Finegold 1986 ",

            "text": ". The high incidence of toxicity associated with parenteral pentamidine has led to modification of the standard regimen (4 rug/kg/day intravenously for 21 days) in an attempt to diminish these adverse effects. One such modification .has been to administer the drug as an aerosol directly to the lungs (Monk & Benfield 1990) . Although initial pilot studies using this regimen showed promising results (Montgomery et al. 1987) , later comparative studies of intravenous versus nebulised pentamidine showed an unacceptably high failure rate (Conte et al. 1990; Soo Hoo et al. 1990 ). The disadvantage with using nebulised pentamidine for treatment is that even the most efficient delivery system can only carry aerosolised drug to those parts of the lung with adequate ventilation. If patients are having difficulty in getting enough oxygen into their alveolar spaces then it is highly unlikely that they will be able to get adequate amounts of drug to the alveoli as well. We therefore would not use this method in patients who are hypoxic or whose chest x-rays show any marked degree of interstitial shadowing. One disadvantage with the nebulised route is that patients are more intolerant to the presence of high concentrations of pentamidine every day when they are acutely unwell (personal observations). Unlike prophylactic therapy, where wide margins of error can be tolerated (in terms of amount of drug deposited in the alveoli), with treatment courses the unknown variables of drug concentration, droplet size, flow rates and nebuliser types become more important. Despite these disadvantages nebulised pentamidine may be suitable for the treatment of patients with mild pneumonia (normal resting arterial blood gases, minimal changes on x-ray), intolerance to sulfa-based drugs or those keen to be treated as outpatients.",

The rationale behind such an approach is that it takes 3 to 5 days of intravenous therapy before adequate lung tissue concentrations are achieved (Donnelly et al. 1988 ), due to the strong protein binding properties of pentamidine; therefore, the use of aerosol delivery should rapidly elevate lung concentrations into the therapeutic range . Once initial pulmonary loading has been achieved, alternate-day intravenous administration should prevent accumulation of pentamidine (Conte et al. 1990 ), and Drugs 42 (4) 1991 hence result in less toxicity. We have found that since the introduction of this new regimen there has been a significant reduction in pentamidinerelated reactions with no loss of efficacy.",

Other adverse reactions are phlebitis at the injection site and alopecia. Although an effective second-line agent in patients with a poor prognosis, studies nearing completion in our unit comparing eflornithine with cotrimoxazole as a first-line agent have not shown cornparable efficacy (Smith et al. I990b ). There are 3 possible explanations for eflornithine being less effective when used as primary therapy rather than salvage therapy. Firstly, eflornithine has no activity against possible secondary bacterial chest infections, which may play a more important role in unresponsive PCP than initially thought. When patients are switched to eflornithine because of apparent failure of primary therapy they are usually also treated with antibacterial and antituberculosis agents. Secondly, the polyamine inhibition of eflornithine in tissue cultures can be bypassed by the addition of exogenous polyamines (Cushion et al. 1985) . It is possible that in very ill patients in an increased catabolic state, who have exhausted polyamine supplies, the effects of eflornithine are enhanced. Finally, in animal models of trypanosomiasis there is pronounced synergism between eflornithine and other anti-protozoal agents (Bac-chi & McCann 1987) ; such may also be true for human PCP.",

The rationale for its use as an aerosol is to deliver the drug specifically to the site of infection and avoid toxicity to other organs.

There is also wide variation in the types of nebulisers used to deliver the drug..As most commercially available nebulisers were designed for the administration of bronchodilators and thus target the large airways, these have had to have been modified, redesigned (Simonds et al. 1989) or new models developed to give a nebuliser that produces large quantities of aerosol capable of alveolar deposition. Unfortunately, some of the nebulisers in current use do not achieve these criteria, and result in inadequte lung protection and dissatisfaction with this form of therapy.",

Both jet and ultrasonic nebulisers, throwaway or reusable, are currently being advocated as the most efficient; however, any nebuliser is appropriate as long as it can consistently deliver enough droplets of adequate size to coat all the alveolar spaces. In practice this means that the majority of droplets should be less than 5JLm in size, preferably 2 to 3JLm (Newman 1985; Stahlhofen et al. 1980) .
