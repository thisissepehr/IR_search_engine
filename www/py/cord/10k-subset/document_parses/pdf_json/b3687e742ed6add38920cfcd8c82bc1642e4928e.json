Nextgeneration sequencing technologies have been used to sequence the fecal DNA samples of the patient, the within sample diversity analysis, enterotyping, functional gene and metagenomic species analysis have been carried on both the patients and healthy controls. The influence of associated treatment in H7N9 infected patients is dramatic and was firstly revealed in species level due to deep sequencing technology. We found that most of the MetaGenomic Species (MGS) enriched in the control samples were Roseburia inulinivorans DSM 16841, butyrate producing bacterium SS3/4 and most of MGS enriched in the H7N9 patients were Clostridium sp. 7 2 43FAA and Enterococcus faecium. It was concluded that H7N9 viral infection and antibiotic administration have a significant effect on the microbiota community with decreased diversity and overgrowth of the bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecium. Enterotype analysis showed that the communities were unstable. Treatment including antivirals, probiotics and antibiotics helps to improve the microbiota diversity and the abundance of beneficial bacteria in the gut.",

The H7N9 virus originated from multiple reassortment events that had not been identified previously in human populations. The hem agglutinin gene (H7) of H7N9 might have evolved from avian influenza viruses of duck origin, whereas the neuraminidase gene (N9) was identical to H7N9 isolates from Korean ducks and wild birds, and the internal genes probably originated from an earlier H9N2 lineage 4 . We previously reported that human infections with H7N9 had fever and rapidly progressive pneumonia that did not respond to antibiotics 1 . However, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock and multi-organ failure were noted in some fatal cases 2,5 .",

To improve therapeutic outcomes and reducing mortality, a treatment regimen combining antiviral therapy, anti-shock therapy, anti-ARDS therapy, anti-infection therapy, maintaining the balance of intestinal microbiota and water-electrolyte was conducted in our hospital.

The Human Microbiome Project (HMP) founded by NIH has sequencing microbiota from different anatomical sites among 242 healthy individuals and generated the largest human microbiome gene resource so far 8 . Metagenomcis of Human Intestinal Tract (MetaHIT) founded by European commission has generated the first human gut gene catalogue and identified enterotypes which are independent of geographic origin in the human gut microbiota 9 . Another gut microbiota study from 345 Chinese individuals with type-2 diabetes (T2D) found 60,000 T2D-associated genes and reported a combination of the genes that could be used to accurately diagnose the disease 10 .",

            "text": "Remarkably, chronic complex diseases have been associated with gut microbiota. Although the intestinal microbiota is generally stable in healthy individuals over long periods of time, antibiotics can significantly reshape the gut microbiota, allowing exogenous microbes to outgrow commensal bacteria and cause permanent changes in varying states of disease 6, 11, 12 . Probiotic agents, which beneficially affect the host by improving the gut microbial balance, have been used for the prevention and treatment of respiratory tract diseases to avoid bacterial translocation 13, 14 . It is noteworthy that gastrointestinal distress symptoms were observed in some of our recently reported cases of H7N9 infection 1, 5 . Additionally, most of patients received antibiotic therapy within six hours after admission and also received probiotic agents in our hospital. Influenza virus infection and subsequent therapies may affect human microbiota in a model system 15, 16 , however, the consequences of H7N9 infection in humans and the interplay between viral pathogens and the microbiota of the host remains unknown.",

Only one sample from each patient (26) and healthy individual (31) was taken for comparison. The clean reads from the sequencing data (Table S3) were aligned against the reference genomes from NCBI and HMP database (Table S4 ). The relative abundance of phylum, genus and species among healthy control (H) groups, patients treated with antibiotic (AB) and without antibiotic (NAB) are shown in Fig. 1 . Phylotypes with a median relative abundance greater than 0.01% (p < 0.01), calculated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test in either the H group or H7N9 patients were included for comparison. At the phylum level, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were dominant in the faecal microbial communities of all groups (Fig. 1a ,c,e). Compared with H group, H7N9 patients had fewer Bacteroidetes in NAB group and fewer Firmicutes in AB group, but higher levels of Proteobacteria in both groups. At the genus level, Bacteroides was dominant in all groups (Fig. 1b,d,f) . In AB group, Escherichia and Parabacteroides were the second and third genus in faecal microbial communities respectively whereas in NAB group, Clostridium and Parabacteroides were the second and third. In contrast, in H group Eubacterium and Roseburia were the second and third, respectively. The top 20 species are shown in Fig. 2 . Ofthe top 20 species in AB group and NAB group, Escherichia coli represents the most and second most abundant species respectively, indicating that Escherichia coli are potentially pathogenic bacteria and whose abundance levels may correlate with the progression of H7N9 infection and associated treatment. We also found Enterococcus faecium as enriched in patient groups. It is worthy to note that Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which is recognized as an anti-inflammatory probiotics 17 , was dramatically decreased in AB group. These results show large differences in the microbial communities between the H7N9 patients and the healthy individuals.",

The third enterotype was driven by the genus Klebsiella and includes only the H7N9 infected patients. We hypothesize that the infection causes the shift of the communities to this enterotype, which is different from those previously reported. Interestingly, the samples from same patient fluctuate between different enterotypes within a short time (< 8 days; Table S3 ). Furthermore, assessment of the proximity of patients by the Spearman correlation analysis indicates that different samples from the same patient do not cluster together (Fig. S2) .

Totally 3,592,885 open reading frames (ORFs) from the 1.3 million contigs were predicted. The final non-redundant gut gene set contained 1,171,674 ORFs with an average length of 722 bp. Then the H7N9 virus infected patient gut microbial gene set was compared to other available gene set like MetaHIT 10 , HMP gut 8 , and T2D 10 . The HMP data set contains sequencing data from multiple human body sites, we here only use gut data from HMP data set. Among all four gene sets, the virus, MetaHIT, HMP gut and T2D gene sets contain 528,592, 1,732,369, 3,123,458 and 867,049 unique genes, respectively (Fig. 5 ). MetaHIT and HMP gut have 20.55% and 37.06% unique genes, respectively, which imply that the gut genes are very different across continents. Virus and T2D sets contained 6.27% and 10.29% unique genes, respectively, and large differences were observed in the two gene sets derived from Chinese cohorts. We next investigate the functional role of the shared or uniquely present genes. We annotated the unique genes in every gene set into KEGG database, because there is huge gene number difference among four gene sets, so percentage of genes in each gene set is used for comparison. The most abundant KEGG orthologous group in all four gene sets was enzyme families, and then membrane transport and Carbohydrate metabolism (Fig. 6a) . We also performed similar analysis using eggNOG database and find the most unique genes function are either function unknown or uncharacterized, the next most abundant categories are general function prediction only, amino acid transport and metabolism (Fig. 6b) .",

Interestingly, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecium could be inferred, on the basis of relationship patterns, to be harmful, in line with previous studies, which concluded that they may cause or underlie bacteraemia and intra-abdominal infections 23, 24 . Interestingly, Clostridium butyricum was enriched in both AB and NAB patient groups, furthermore, NAB group has a higher abundance than AB group, indicating that Clostridium tablets may exert their functions in the gut (Fig. 3b) . In contrast, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroidesovatus, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia intestinalis, Eubacteriumeligens, Bifidobacterium longumand Haemophilus parainfluenzae may have a beneficial impact in this specific biological context. In particular, the finding here that Haemophilus parainfluenzae was enriched in healthy controls is consistent with the result from MGWAS study 10 , which imply an unknown function of this known pathogen. In our study, patients with H7N9 of different treatment regimens had similar gut community changes. These results led to a conclusion that composition changes observed between H7N9 patients and healthy controls were mainly due to viral infection and associated treatment.",

The clustering analysis of these samples showed that they also could be grouped into three enterotypes as in previous studies but with a different third enterotype driven by Klebsiella, which included the patients only. We suggest that this enterotype may correspond to specific microbial communities that form in H7N9 infected individuals. The enterotypes are not stable, possibly due to the conjunction of viral infection and low diversity. The MGS analysis was performed in this study and this was reported possibly to be markers for specific disease 20 . We also found that many MGSs enriched in healthy controls or patients and most of them are consistent with the finding in genus or species abundances changes in this study, such as MGS Clostridium butyricum and Roseburia intestinalis.",
