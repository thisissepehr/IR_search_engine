Since mitigation reduces both peak prevalence and the number of people who fall ill, the answer might appear to be yes. But mitigation also prolongs epidemics and therefore the time susceptible people engage in activities to avoid infection. These avoidance activities come at a cost-in lost production or consumption, for example. Whether private mitigation yields net social benefits depends on the social weight given to the costs of illness and illness avoidance, now and into the future. We show that, for a large class of infectious diseases, private risk mitigation is socially beneficial. However, in cases where society discounts the future at either very low or very high rates relative to private individuals, or where it places a low weight on the private cost of illness, the social cost of illness under proportionate mixing (doing nothing) may be lower than the social cost of illness under preferential mixing (avoiding infectious individuals). That is, under some circumstances, society would prefer shorter, more intense epidemics without avoidance costs over longer, less intense epidemics with avoidance costs. A sobering (although not surprising) implication of this is that poorer societies should be expected to promote less private diseaserisk mitigation than richer societies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The epidemiological effects of public disease-risk mitigation measures such as quarantines, school closures, vaccinations, trade interdictions, or travel restrictions have attracted considerable attention (see (Chowell et al. 2004a; Ferguson et al. 2006; Chowell et al. 2004b; Shim and Galvani 2009) for examples relating to SARS, ebola, and avian influenza).

First, each of these models is capable of endemic levels of infection.

We show that the lower the social discount rate, the greater the range of costs of illness over which the society will benefit more from proportionate than preferential mixing. Fig. 4 At B=0, there is no cost of illness, and proportionate mixing dominates preferential mixing for both private individuals and society. For B>0 and \u03b1=0, the social weight on illness is zero, and proportionate mixing dominates preferential mixing for society.

The higher the social weight attaching to the private cost of illness, \u03b1, the higher the discount rate at which preferential mixing dominates proportionate mixing and the lower the cost of illness at which preferential mixing dominates proportionate mixing. Increases in the private cost of illness induce private disease-risk mitigation. It is intuitive that a rise in the social weight attaching to the private cost of illness, \u03b1, will also increase the likelihood that private disease-risk mitigation will be beneficial from a social perspective. Increases in the social discount rate relative to the private discount rate increases the relative social weight attaching to present over future costs of illness and illness avoidance. It is also intuitive that this will lower the social cost of prolonging epidemics. Figure 6 considers a special case-where the social weight on the private cost of illness is \u03b1=1/B. This implies that the private cost of illness is given the same weight by society regardless of whether that cost is high or low to individuals. Individuals are assumed to respond to the cost of illness as described above, and the net payoff to society relative to proportionate mixing is judged solely in terms of the strength of the private response. In this special case, we see a different relation between the social discount rate and the likelihood that private disease-risk mitigation will be socially beneficial. As we vary the (daily) social discount factor and the private cost of illness in this case, we see that if the private cost of illness is low, proportionate mixing always dominates preferential mixing. However, as the private cost of illness rises, whether proportionate or preferential mixing dominates depends on the discount rate. If the cost of illness is extremely high, and the social discount rate is less than or equal to the private discount rate, preferential mixing dominates proportionate mixing in all cases.

While vaccination (either privately chosen or publically mandated) is the main form of risk mitigation for many diseases, private Bdistancing^strategies that reduce exposure to infectious classes are also common. Private effort to avoid infection depends on the costs and benefits of that effort for the individual. Whether private risk mitigation also benefits society depends on the way it changes epidemic dynamics. We find that private disease-risk mitigation always not only reduces the number falling ill but also extends the duration of epidemics. While the social net benefits of private disease-risk mitigation are, intuitively, increasing in the social cost of illness and decreasing in the cost of illness avoidance, they are also sensitive to the timing of these costs. Whether private risk mitigation generates social benefits relative to proportionate 2 We acknowledge that the individual could reduce contact volume in order to reduce risk and without asymptomatic infection, it would make no difference (Morin et al. 2014) .

The cost of illness is measured on the Y-axis, and the daily discount factor on the X-axis. For \u03b1\u22650.2, preferential mixing dominates proportionate mixing at all social discount rates. The daily discount factor used to calculate private risk mitigation behavior, 0.9986, is indicated on each panel. This corresponds to an annual discount rate of around 5 % mixing-i.e., whether the social cost of illness and illness avoidance is lower under preferential than proportionate mixing-depends both on the social weight on the private cost of illness and on the social discount rate. We find that if the private cost of illness is high relative to the social cost of illness, then society may be better off allowing a disease to run its course without incurring the cost of disease avoidance. Similarly, if the social discount rate is very low relative to the private discount rate, society may be better off avoiding the prolongation of epidemics that comes with preferential mixing.
