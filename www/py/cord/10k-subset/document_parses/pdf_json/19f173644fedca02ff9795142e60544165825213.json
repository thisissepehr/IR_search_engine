A computed tomography scan showed obvious infiltrations at lower parts of both lungs. Arterial blood gas analysis confirmed a severe respiratory failure (type I). Her sputum and throat swabs were checked for nucleic acid of influenza A and the result was positive for influenza A H7N9. She was diagnosed as having severe influenza A H7N9 and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and was admitted to an intensive care unit. She was given comprehensive treatment, including oseltamivir, methylprednisolone, immunoglobulin, gastric protection, and noninvasive mechanical ventilation. Her condition improved 4 days later. However, some symptoms exacerbated again 2 days later with ground-glass changes appearing in upper area of right lung and the titer of antibody to Mycoplasma pneumoniae rising from 1:80 to 1:640. She was reasonably considered to be infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae as well, and azithromycin and moxifloxacin were added to her treatment. Oseltamivir was discontinued because of three consecutive negative results of nucleic acid for influenza A H7N9, but anti-Mycoplasma treatment was continued. Although her symptoms and abnormal changes on computed tomography scan slowly went away, she finally recovered from the mixed infection after a total of 33 days of management. Conclusion: In patients with confirmed influenza A H7N9 infection whose condition worsens again, especially with new infiltration or lung ground-glass infiltration, one should suspect infection by other pathogens such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae.",

She had been to the local poultry market with her husband to buy a live chicken and had eaten chicken meat on January 2, 2017. She is a retired teacher, and she has three children, all of whom are healthy. She is optimistic and has healthy social relations. She currently lives with her husband. She went to see a doctor at a hospital in the southeast state of Guizhou Province on January 11, 2017. An examination showed a fever with body temperature of 38.3\u00b0C, blood pressure of 130/78 mmHg, and pulse rate of 85 beats per minute (bpm). She was oriented and cooperative and in fine general condition. Her mental status was conscious and her neurological examination was normal. She does not smoke tobacco and does not consume alcohol. Her sputum and throat swabs were collected to test the nucleic acid of avian influenza A virus. Then, she was given some general anti-virus drugs. Fever persisted and she felt short of breath, so she went to the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University on January 13, 2017. An examination revealed a highest body temperature of 39.5\u00b0C, pulse rate of 83 bpm, respiratory rate of 25 to 28 breaths per minute, moist rales located at middle-lower fields of both lungs, blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) of 94% (oxygenation at 4 L/minute of oxygen with a nasal catheter), noninvasive blood pressure of 112/64 mmHg, white blood cell count of 3.46 \u00d7 10 9 /L (neutrophils, 69.4%; lymphocytes, 0.8 \u00d7 10 9 /L), oxygen arterial tension (PaO 2 ) of 58.4 mmHg with fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 0.41), and carbon dioxide arterial tension (PaCO 2 ) of 31.8 mmHg. A CT scan showed obvious infiltrates in both lungs and some ground-glass opacity in the middle field of her right lung (Fig. 1a) . In her past medical history, she had hypertension and COPD. Because of suspicion for contagious disease, she was admitted to the Department of Infectious Disease of our hospital and given antibiotics, oxygen therapy, and oseltamivir. On January 14, 2017, she was definitely diagnosed as having influenza A H7N9 by the positive results of nucleic acid testing and was separated from other patients. She was transferred to the ICU on the same day because of obvious dyspnea and shortness of breath. Her immediate examination on ICU admission showed oxygen pulse saturation of 65%, a body temperature of 38.5\u00b0C, noninvasive blood pressure of 128/75 mmHg, a maximal respiratory rate of 30 to 35 breaths per minute, and she was conscious and cooperative. Her neurological examination was completely normal. Arterial blood gas result revealed a PH of 7.48, PaCO 2 of 31 mmHg, PaO 2 of 49.1 mmHg (FiO 2 0.41), and bicarbonate (HCO 3 \u2212 ) of 22.8 mmol/l; biochemical results consisted of total protein of 57.38 g/l, proalbumin of 69 mg/l, potassium of 3.39 mmol/l, sodium of 129.36 mmol/l, creative kinase of 162.15 U/l, creative kinasemyocardial band (MB) of 8 U/l, lactate dehydrogenase of 420 U/l, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) of 185 ng/l, and procalcitonin (PCT) of 0.056 \u03bcg/L. The titer of antibody to MP was 1:80. Liver and renal functions were almost normal. Urine analysis showed red blood cell of 8 cells/ low-power field (LP) and white cell of 10 cells/LP.",

Oseltamivir at 300 mg/day was orally administered for the first 6 days, then at 150 mg/day for the following 3 days. As she was conscious and very cooperative, she was given noninvasive mechanical ventilation (PHILIPS Respironics V60, Respironics California, Inc, USA). Her input of fluid volume was strictly limited and her hemodynamics were stable except for occasional slight fluctuations. After having been treated for 4 days, her respiratory symptoms began to alleviate, and oxygenation improved with PaO 2 up to 66 mmHg (FiO 2 0.4), and respiratory rate decreasing to 24 to 28 breaths per minute. However, 2 days later, she began to cough with less sputum, and tachypnea and weakness were exacerbated. The titer of MP antibodies gradually increased from 1:80 to 1:160, and then arrived at 1:640 within 9 days. A CT scan on January 26, 2017 revealed an enlarged ground-glass infiltrate in the upper area of her right lung (Fig. 1b) . She was reasonably considered to be over-infected with MP, and then orally administered azithromycin (0.5 g/ day) and intravenously administered moxifloxacin (400 mg/ day) were prescribed on January 23, 2017. At the same time, oseltamivir was discontinued because of three consecutive negative results of nucleic acid for influenza A H7N9. After 5 to 6 days of anti-MP treatment, her symptoms alleviated and the titer of the antibodies decreased. A gradual reabsorption of ground-glass infiltrates was seen in upper lobe of her right lung after 9 days of treatment against MP (Fig. 1c) .

But as far as we know, the clinical condition of co-infection caused by influenza A H7N9 and MP has not been described before. Although \"atypical\" pneumonia was recognized in the 1930s, MP was actually isolated from the sputum of a patient with \"atypical\" pneumonia in 1944 [9] . Early clinical observations indicated a relatively high prevalence of MP respiratory infection in younger children, especially among school-aged children from 5 to 15 years of age [10] . So far, there have been fewer reports of MP respiratory infection in older individuals. Lung infection caused by MP can be diagnosed with culture of respiratory specimens and/or a fourfold rise in antibody titer to MP within 2 weeks [11] . In our patient, the MP antibody titer rose fourfold within 9 days, along with the exacerbation of some symptoms and appearance of some new ground-glass lung infiltrates. This supported our diagnosis of MP in this patient [11] . Since the incubation period of MP infection is often as long as 1 to 3 weeks [5] , we speculate that MP may have already existed in our patient's respiratory system at the time when she was infected with avian influenza A H7N9.",
