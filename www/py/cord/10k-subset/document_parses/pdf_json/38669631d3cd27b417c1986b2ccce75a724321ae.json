More than 30 sporadic cases of H5N1 infection occurred in 2013, for a total of 648 laboratory-confirmed illnesses, and \u223c60% mortality was reported to the World Health Organization by 16 countries from 2003 to 2013 [5] .

Because vaccine supplies may be limited, it is also important to lower the antigen dose required to induce protection in order to make limited vaccine supplies available for protection of more people. For stockpiled vaccine antigens that require an adjuvant to achieve protective antibody titers, 1 rapid response approach would be to match the relevant antigen to a stockpiled adjuvant at pandemic onset and mix the reagents at designated field sites-the mix-and-match approach tested here.",
