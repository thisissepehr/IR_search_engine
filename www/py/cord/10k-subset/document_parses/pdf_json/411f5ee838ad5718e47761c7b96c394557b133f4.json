The annual contribution of influenza to use of intensive care is difficult to estimate, as many people with influenza present without a classic influenza syndrome and laboratory testing may not be performed. We used a population-based approach to estimate and compare the impact of recent epidemics of seasonal and pandemic influenza. Methods: For 2007 to 2010, time series describing health outcomes in various population groups were prepared from a database of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions in the state of New South Wales, Australia. The Serfling approach, a time series method, was used to estimate seasonal patterns in health outcomes in the absence of influenza epidemics. The contribution of influenza was estimated by subtracting expected seasonal use from observed use during each epidemic period. Results: The estimated excess rate of influenza-associated respiratory ICU admissions per 100,000 inhabitants was more than three times higher in 2007 (2.6/100,000, 95% CI 2.0 to 3.1) than the pandemic year, 2009 (0.76/100,000, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.48). In 2009, the highest excess respiratory ICU admission rate was in 17 to 64 year olds (2.9/ 100,000, 95% CI 2.2 to 3.6), while in 2007, the highest excess rate was in those aged 65 years or older (9.5/100,000, 95% CI 6.2 to 12.8). In 2009, the excess rate was 17/100,000 (95% CI 14 to 20) in Aboriginal people and 14/100,000 (95% CI 13 to 16) in pregnant women. Conclusion: While influenza was diagnosed more frequently and peak use of intensive care was higher during the epidemic of pandemic influenza in 2009, overall excess admissions to intensive care for respiratory illness was much greater during the influenza season in 2007. Thus, the impact of seasonal influenza on intensive care use may have previously been under-recognised. In 2009, high ICU use among young to middle aged adults was offset by relatively low use among older adults, and Aboriginal people and pregnant women were substantially over-represented in ICUs.

Even so, the 2009 period was highly unusual in that increases in influenza-associated intensive care admissions were observed only in people under 65 years. Older people were relatively protected, compared to normal seasonal influenza epidemic periods. Studies both in Australia and internationally have found that older populations tended to have a high prevalence of pre-existing crossreacting influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 antibodies, while few younger people had such protection [23] [24] [25] . Hence, the all ages excess rate in 2009 was small when compared to 2007, as the increased rate in younger people was offset by the unusually low rate in older people. This was not the case in 2007, where rates were higher than expected in all age groups. A study from Denmark examining all influenza-associated hospital admissions also did not find an increase during the first epidemic of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus compared with seasonal influenza, except in people younger than 65 years [26] . Our findings are consistent with those of a study in a US hospital that found that patients at greatest risk of complications from seasonal influenza tend to be older, with a mean age of 75 years [27] .

This season was characterised by low influenza activity and very low influenza-related ICU use.

A more recent study of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people found that a younger age distribution and a higher prevalence of underlying chronic conditions are a possible explanation for the apparent increased risk of influenza-related hospitalisation [32] .

The influence of influenza during 2007 may have been more evident in the broader respiratory diagnosis group due to the older age of those most at risk of influenza complications in 2007. Older people have more complex and chronic illnesses which could mask the recognition of influenza's role in the illness and lead to more frequent diagnoses of alternative conditions such as pneumonia and respiratory failure/end-stage respiratory disease that could be secondary respiratory complications of primary influenza infection [11, 37] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1405, "end": 1409, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1410, "end": 1413, "text": "37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 544, "end": 552, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "While influenza was diagnosed more frequently and peak use of intensive care was higher in 2009, a broader assessment of respiratory admissions to intensive care indicates that 2007 seasonal influenza resulted in a higher rate of excess admissions to ICU than 2009 pandemic influenza.

In 2009, relatively high use of intensive care among young to middle-aged adults was offset by low use among adults aged over 65 years.
