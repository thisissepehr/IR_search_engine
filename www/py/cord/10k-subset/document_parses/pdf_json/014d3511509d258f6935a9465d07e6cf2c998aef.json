            "text": "Individual viral particles usually include either an RNA or a DNA genome. 12 A DNA biosensor is based on the immobilization of a single stranded oligonucleotide on a transducer surface to detect its complementary DNA sequence due to surface hybridization. Then, the hybrid formed on the electrode surface is transformed into an analytical signal via a transducer. 13 Electrochemical DNA biosensors have drawn attention due to their advantages such as portability, simplicity, cost-effectiveness, fast response time, high sensitivity, high selectivity, and compatibility with miniaturized detection technologies. 14 The working principle of an electrochemical DNA biosensor depends on two steps including the interaction or hybridization between DNA-DNA, DNA-RNA, and protein-ligand molecules, or conversion of the changes in the DNA structure or the assembly into an electrochemical signal. [15] [16] [17] In addition, there are indirect techniques that use electrochemical active DNA intercalators, enzymes, redox mediators and particles for the amplification of signal. 16, [18] [19] [20] A variety of electrochemical DNA biosensors have been developed for detecting different viruses. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] West Nile virus (WNV) is a member of the Flaviviridae family (genus Flavivirus) that is endemic in many parts of the world and transmitted by Culex mosquito vectors. 27 WNV commonly presents with flu like symptoms but can cause severe neurological symptoms and even death in a small subset of patients. Detection of active viral infection can help with disease management as well as helping detect WNV present in mosquito populations to reduce transmission. Wang et al., developed a label-free capacitance-based DNA capacitance sensor for the Kunjin subtype of WNV using interdigitated Au electrodes ( Figure 1A ). 28 A 24-nucleotide DNA probe based on a West Nile virus sequence was immobilized on a pre-cleaned gold coated interdigitated electrode (IDE) followed by inactivation of vacant gold sites with the use of 11-Mercapto-1-undecanol (MCU). Due to the hybridization of nucleic acid targets with ssDNA probe oligomers on microelectrodes, the capacitance changes were measured and found as 70 nF in response to as few as 20 complementary DNA targets (0.25 attogram) at a concentration of 1.5 aM. Capacitance changes had excellent linear behavior toward complementary target with concentration of 20 to 2 million target DNA molecules, which enables sample analysis in a typical clinical application environment. The biosensor advantages include low detection limit and better reproducibility compared to other non-faradaic capacitive biosensors. Moreover, specificity tests of the biosensor were performed. Unlike non-complementary target DNAs, complementary DNA showed a large capacitance change in the biosensor.",

            "text": "Ebola (Family Filoviridae) infection can lead to fatal hemorrhagic fever, but death can be prevented with various therapies if the infection is detected in time. [29] [30] [31] [32] According to the World Health Organization, there are over 25,000 cases and 10,000 fatalities caused by Ebola virus in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in 2016. [33] [34] [35] Due to the resource-poor regions of Africa where Ebola outbreaks generally occur, developing inexpensive point-of-care detection devices is highly desirable. Screen-printed electrodes (SPEs) are often used for fabrication of biosensors since they possess advantages such as disposability, mechanically robustness, inexpensiveness, stability and reproducibility for mass production. 36 For instance, a novel electrochemical-based nucleic acid sensor was fabricated for Ebola virus RNA detection (Figure 1B) . 25 In the first step, the gold surface of screen-printed electrode was functionalized with a thiolated DNA capture probe sequence via S-Au bonding. Then, biotinylated target strand DNA was immobilized to the electrode surface for hybridization of thiolated DNA single strand capture. Subsequently, the streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase enzyme was exposed to the biotinylated hybrid via biotin-streptavidin conjugation bond and, covered with 4-aminophenyl phosphate solution. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to monitor DNA immobilization and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) method was used to detect the enzymatically-produced 4-aminophenol. The electrical signal of the fabricated biosensor exhibits a linear relationship between 10 nM-75 nM Ebola virus complementary target strand with 4.7 nM limit of detection under optimum conditions. However, this method has not been applied for detecting Ebola virus RNA in real samples yet and would require amplification for diagnostic use.",

            "text": "Similarly, a novel label-free electrochemical method for rapid detection of hepatitis A virus (HAV) was developed by Manzano et al. 26 HAV is a picornavirus (Family Picornaviridae) that possesses a small positive strand RNA genome. HAV infection, which commonly occurs through a fecal oral route with patients having consumed contaminated food, causes a range of symptoms including nausea, diarrhea, and liver disfunction. The early symptoms of HAV can often be mistaken for Influenza infection, so positive diagnosis can help avoid inappropriate treatment with anti-influenza drugs. A screen-printed gold electrode was incubated with thiolated-ssDNA probe. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using the indicator, tripropylamine (TPA), to observe CV peak current that occurred because of hybridization of complementary synthetic target DNA sequences on the electrode surface. The fabricated sensor demonstrated a LOD of 0.65 pM and 6.94 fg/\u03bcL for the complementary ssDNA and cDNA sequences characteristic for HAV target, respectively. The target HAV cDNA was also quantified by nested real-time PCR and limit of detection was found as 6.4 fg/\u03bcL. The DNA electrochemical biosensor is advantageous relative to traditional and molecular methods such as PCR-based methods due to its cost and fast detection of HAV. 37, 38 Hepatitis B virus (HBV), a circular double-stranded DNA virus, infects millions of people and causes diseases such as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. 39 An estimated 800 million people are infected with HBV globally, and almost one million people die every year due to HBV induced liver disease. 40, 41 Huang et al. developed an electrochemical biosensor for detection of target DNA derived from the HBV genome. 42 Rolling circle amplification (RCA) and molecular beacon (MB) mediated circular strand displacement (CSD), which are isothermal DNA amplification methods, were used for electrochemical detection of HBV DNA sequences. The gold surface electrode was modified with MB. RCA was employed to amplify the DPV current signal response. Since methylene blue specifically binds to the guanine bases of DNA molecules, it was used as the electrochemical redox probe. The biosensor demonstrated a linear DNA concentration range from 10 aM to 700 aM with a 2.6 aM detection limit under optimal experimental conditions. Using the RCA and MB mediated CSD approaches, the biosensor sensitivity was improved relative to traditional methods. 43, 44 Various nanomaterials have been utilized in nucleic acid-based biosensors due to properties such as large surface area, high conductivity, and strong affinity toward bioreceptor probes with reactive groups such as thiols leading to high sensitivity and low limits of detection. These nanomaterials could be gold nanoparticles, carbon nanomaterials, magnetic nanoparticles or magnetic beads (MBs), silica nanoparticles, quantum dots (QDs) and hybrid nanostructures. 45 Khater et al. developed a rapid, label-free impedimetric biosensor for citrus tristeza virus (CTV) detection using gold nanoparticles ( Figure 1C ). 46 CTV (Family Closteroviridae) is a filamentous positive strand RNA virus that infects citrus trees (sour orange) and is transmitted through insect transmission by aphids. CTV causes stunting, stem pitting, low yields, and poor fruit quality from infected trees and is of major concern to the citrus industry. 47 Traditional methods for CTV detection use dot-blot hybridization, which is slow and labor intensive in terms of analysis time and quantitative analysis. Kather et al. used gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) deposited on the surface of a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE). Then, poly (AT)-thiolated ssDNA probes were covalently attached onto the AuNPs-modified electrode surface in the presence of mercaptohexanol (MCH). Here, poly (AT) and MCH were used to enhance sensor selectivity by preventing any non-specific binding of nucleobases. The hybridization process was investigated by EIS in Fe(CN 6 ) 4\u2212 /Fe(CN 6 ) 3\u2212 red-ox system. The sensor demonstrated logarithmic behavior in the concentration range between 0.1-10 \u03bcM of CTV-related DNA with LOD of 100 nM and a 65 min assay time. The biosensor was applied in leaf extracts from healthy citrus plants spiked with various target DNA concentrations and detected the target DNA concentration as low as 500 nM.

After that, CHIKV probe DNA was immobilized onto this modified electrode. CV and DPV were used to analyze the hybridization. The biosensor showed LOD of 0.1 nM in a linear range between 0.1 nM-100 \u03bcM. The CHIK probe DNA/ Fe 3 O 4 @Au/ePAD platform was also used for detection of CHIKV target RNA in serum sample.

Au nanotubes have drawn attention due to their outstanding properties like being physicochemically stable and capable of sensitively detecting complex analytes. 55 The 3-D nanostructured-based templates are suitable for DNA detection since they offer nanofluidic channel structures. Shariati et al. reported a human papilloma virus DNA biosensor with the lack of labelling. 22 A gold nanotube decorated nanoporous polycarbonate (AuNTs-PC) template was created by electrodeposition and used as the working electrode. Then, thiolated 25-mer ssDNA probe was immobilized on the surface of the AuNTs-PC electrode. EIS was used to observe the DNA hybridization using external electric field bias, which helps probes and targets orientate flat on the surface. Due to the presence of AuNTs and the electric field, this DNA-based sensor displayed a wide linear detection range of 0.01 pM-1 \u03bcM with a very low LOD of 1 fM. The selectivity of the fabricated sensor was confirmed by mismatch, non-complementary and complementary DNA oligonucleotides.",

            "text": "Influenza virus is a common human pathogen that causes a high level of morbidity and mortality. 56 The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that influenza leads to 250,000-500,000 deaths annually all around the world through respiratory infections, and young children and the elderly are particularly at risk. 57 Approximately 50% of the population is affected by pandemics caused by Influenza A, whereas Influenza B and C lead to mild outbreaks. 58, 59 It becomes challenging to control influenza A due to the propagation through aerosol particles, its short incubation time, and yearly mutation. 60, 61 The Influenza A/H1N1 strain has resulted in more than 10,000 deaths and 275,000 hospitalizations while costing billions of dollars for health care in the United States alone. 57, 62 Moreover, there is concern that pathogenic H5N1 has the potential to be used as a biological weapon, and developing sensitive and robust point-of-care diagnostics is critical for rapid response. 63, 64 Tran et al. fabricated carbon nanotube basedfield effect transistors (CNTFETs)-based DNA sensor for detecting Influenza virus RNA. 65 Synthetic DNA matching the RNA sequence was used as a model. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been employed for fabrication of electrodes because of their large surface to volume ratio and excellent electronic characteristics as well. The surface of carbon nanotubes was modified with strong nitric acid. 66 After the pretreatment, probe DNA strands were deposited to the CNT network followed by immersing in a solution of the target DNA for the DNA hybridization. The sensor exhibited high reproducibility and fast response time of less than a minute. They reported a selectivity and LOD of 1 pM to 10 nM and 1 pM, respectively. The biosensor has a promising potential for detection of Influenza type A DNA. Recently, nanoparticle (NP)carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) hybrid structures have become popular owing to their physical and mechanical properties, and excellent electrical conductivity. CNTs are the most widely used nanomaterials to generate Au based-nanocomposites hybrid structure since they can be easily modified and have distinguished properties. Au-CNT nanocomposites can be produced either by attaching Au nanostructures directly to CNTs or by forming some binding between Au nanostructures and CNTs via Au-S bond or \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking. 67, 68 Over 31 kinds of foodborne pathogens caused 600 million foodborne illnesses and 420,000 deaths globally with norovirus responsible for approximately 37% of these illnesses. 69, 70 Therefore, there is great interest in rapid and sensitive detection of noroviruses. Lee et al. developed an electrical resistance biosensor based on multi functionalized-CNTs for detection of influenza A and norovirus target DNA. 71 First, gold/magnetic iron-oxide nanoparticle (MNP)-decorated CNTs (Au/MNP-CNT) were synthesized and deposited on the surface of a commercial planar Pt-interdigitated electrode using an external magnetic field. Then, this electrode was conjugated with thiol (-SH)modified probe DNAs for influenza virus and norovirus. Linear sweep voltammetry was used for target DNA detection. While single and fully mismatched DNA sequences were used to examine the selectivity of the sensor toward influenza A virus, Zika virus RNA and influenza A RNA were used to investigate the selectivity for norovirus against RNA viruses. The Au/MNP-CNT-based DNA sensing platform demonstrated high selectivity against target RNAs. Electrical resistance of the sensing channel displayed a linear behavior with the concentration of target DNA in the range from 1 pM to 10 nM with LOD of 8.4 pM and 8.8 pM for influenza virus and norovirus, respectively. While these levels are low, they are still well above what would be required for detection without amplification.",

However, there several challenges remain for nucleic acid biosensors. First, the effective use of nucleic acid biosensors requires that the target nucleic acid be accessible to the biosensor surface. Virus nucleic acids in patient samples (serum, saliva, urine, etc.) are generally protected from their environments inside viral particles. For the biosensor to detect the nucleic acid, the virus particles need to be disrupted in a way that releases the nucleic acid from the viral particle. Disruption of virus particles can be performed via heating or chemical treatment, which adds additional sample preparation procedures into the testing paradigm needed to detect target nucleic acids. Heat disruption is the gentlest way of disruption particles, although solvent conditions during heating need to be well controlled to avoid base-mediated hydrolysis of RNA genomes. Chemical disruption using detergents to dissolve membranes (sodium dodecyl sulfate, Triton X 100, etc.) and chaotropic agents to unfold proteins (urea, guanidinium hydrochloride, etc.) can be effective, but can affect subsequent steps in analyte detection and must be removed. Protein removal is particularly important in negative sense RNA viruses, such as Influenza and Ebola viruses, as the genomes present in viral particles are tightly bound to nucleoproteins that must be removed before sequence-specific probes can recognize viral RNAs. Nucleic acid purification is essential for detecting viral genomic nucleic acids in real patient samples, but increases the time and effort required to sense nucleic acid analytes.",

            "text": "Another critical issue with nucleic acid biosensors is viral genome structure. Many of the nucleic acid sensors listed above test their system using short oligonucleotide DNAs that contain viral sequences. Short RNA or DNA sequences purchased from commercial vendors are inexpensive, easy to work with, and available at high concentrations but are very different than purified viral genomes. Long singlestranded viral genomes can adopt a wide range of thermodynamically stable secondary structures (including stems, loops, and pseudoknots) and these structures can strongly interfere with sequence-specific DNA probes from recognizing the target nucleic acid. 72 Hybridization of DNA probes with long single-stranded nucleic acids requires the target first being completely denatured to remove inhibitory secondary structure, followed by time for limited numbers of denatured target genomes to interact with surface-bound probe DNAs. Hybridization in this context is similar to hybridization performed in nuclease protection assays, which use long RNA probes (200-500 bases) with a short 95\u00b0C denaturation step followed by 12-16 hr incubations at high temperatures (55-65\u00b0C) in high ionic strength solutions to reduce secondary structure formation and achieve efficient and specific hybridization. These conditions are not required for the short oligonucleotide targets but are critical for detecting longer genomes. Incorporation of rapid and efficient hybridization conditions are essential for nucleic acid biosensors to be useful at the point of care. The use of molecular crowding chemicals (such as polyethylene glycol) or applying electrophoretic potentials to biosensors to increase local concentrations of DNA probes and target nucleic acids to increase hybridization rates may help decrease hybridization time and increase efficiency.",

Base-paring between both strands of dsRNA and dsDNA viral genomes generally precludes biosensor-bound probe molecules from binding in a sequence-specific manner, making recognition impossible. Variants of traditional nucleic acids, such as peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) and bridged nucleic acids (BNAs), have the potential to undergo strand invasion and perform local denaturation of nucleic acids, but these tend to be relatively expensive. Additionally, while it is possible to denature double-stranded nucleic acids with heat or chemical treatment, the affinity of the long single-stranded genome strands for each other is generally much higher than the affinity for short DNA probes bound on biosensor surfaces. This leads to complementary strands of viral genomes preferentially re-hybridizing to each other rather than to the biosensor-bound DNA, reducing the sensitivity of the biosensor.",

            "text": "Finally, the amount of viral genomes present in clinical samples is generally fairly small and in many cases much lower than the LOD of reported biosensors. For example, Faye et al. performed a retrospective study of viremia (viral genome copies/ml plasma) in Ebola virus infected individuals and compared viral loads to disease outcomes. 73 This study found that patients with less than 10 5 genome copies/ml had a low probability of death, patients with viral titers between 10 5 and 10 6 had moderate probability of death, and patients with titers over 10 6 had a high probability of death. Viral titers over 10 8 genome copies/ml were not observed in patients. 10 8 genome copies/ml appears to be quite a large number, but actually only represents approximately 166 attomoles of viral genomes per ml of plasma. Biosensors that demonstrate nanomolar and picomolar LODs are 6 to 9 orders of magnitudes less sensitive than necessary to detect Ebola virus even in very highly infected patients as described above. For nucleic acid biosensors to be useful for detecting viral genomes without additional amplification, they need to be able to detect between 10 9 genomes/ml (1.6 femtomoles) and 1000 molecules/ml (1.6 zeptomoles). In other words, detection limits for biosensors should be below \u223c100 aM for the biosensor to be able to detect clinically relevant infections.",

            "text": "The working principle of an electrochemical immunosensor is based on the generation of an electrical signal due to the specific interaction between antibody and antigen in the presence of an electrochemical transducer. Antibodies are attached to the biosensor surface with either covalent or non-covalent bonding. Biotin-streptavidin or conductive polymers (polypyrrole) are commonly used examples for immobilizing antibodies on electrodes for these applications. 74 After the capture antibodies are immobilized on a sensor surface, a complex between the immobilized capture antibodies, the antigen, and detection antibodies are used for sandwich-type immunosensors. 75 Immobilizing antibodies on a solid surface can also improve their stability. 76, 77 Different immunoassay electrochemical sensing platforms have become available owing to their high affinity and sensitivity. [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] Assays targeting viral antigens.-Haji-Hashemi et al. presented the first label-free electrochemical immunosensor to detect CTV antigens. 83 First, a gold electrode was modified using 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) and 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA). Then, the terminal carboxylic groups on surface of the modified electrode were activated using N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-Nethyl carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinamide (NHS). The modified gold electrode was incubated with the antibody against the coat protein (CP) of CTV. After that, a solution of BSA was dropped on the electrode to block the non-specific sites. DPV method was used to evaluate the antibody-antigen interaction on the electrode surface in the presence of [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3\u2212/4\u2212 . The detection limit was found to be 0.27 nM, which is lower than ELISA and other immunoassay techniques for CTV detection. 84, 85 In another example of CTV detection, a microfluidic electrochemical device (\u03bcFED) was proposed by Freitas et al. 86 The \u03bcFED included an array of eight screen-printed electrodes fabricated. Poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride solution) (PDDA) was applied to electrode surface to create a positively charged film. Next, the electrodes were modified with AuNPs resulting in formation of a PDDA/AuNP bilayer. Monoclonal antibodies specific for the capsid protein of CTV (Ab 1 ) were covalently immobilized on AuNPs by EDS/NHS coupling procedure. To block the non-activated carboxyl groups, BSA was used. After that, horseradish peroxidase enzyme (HRP) and polyclonal capture antibody (Ab 2 ) were conjugated to carboxyl-functionalized magnetic beads (MBs). The prepared Ab 2 /MB/HRP was used to capture CP-CTV biomarker from sample. The \u03bcFED array modified with Ab 1 was incubated with the CP/Ab 2 /MB/HRP, forming a sandwich-type immunoassay. The electrochemical detection of the magnetically captured biomarker was achieved by simultaneously applying a potential of \u22120.2 V to the 8-immunosensors via amperometry. The detection mechanism is based on the enzymatic activity of HRP using H 2 O 2 and hydroquinone (HQ), and shown as following:",

Ning and coworkers developed a simple, sensitive electrochemical immunosensor to detect ALV virus particles. 78 A ferrocene-functionalized gold nanoparticle (Fc-AuNP) nanocomposite was prepared. Then, \u03b2-cyclodextrin (\u03b2-CD) was covalently bound to secondary antibodies (Ab 2 ) and incubated with Fc-AuNP resulting in Fc-AuNP-\u03b2-CD-Ab 2 bioconjugates. Next, perylene-3,4,9,10tetracarboxylic acid (PTCA) was combined with graphene via \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions to overcome the limitations of graphene itself for primary antibody (Ab 1 ) attachment. While GR-PTCA was utilized as the sensing platform to capture Ab 1 , Fc-AuNP-\u03b2-CD -Ab 2 was used the label. DPV was performed to obtain the amperometric responses of the immunosensor. The Au NPs improved the sensitivity of immunosensor due to their ability to bind multiple Fc molecules. The immunosensor exhibited a linear current response against ALV-J in the range from 10 2.0 to 10 4.0 TCID 50 /mL with a detection limit of 10 1.93 TCID 50 /mL. Bhardwaj et al. developed a novel a vertical flow assay (VFA)based paper immunosensor to detect Influenza H1N1 viruses electrochemically and colorimetrically. 99 A double pore size (DP) sample pad, a conjugate pad, and a nitrocellulose (NC) membrane strip were attached together for fabrication of the VFA sensor. Wax printing was used to pattern the NC membrane strip. A gold paper electrode, carbon paste electrode and Ag/AgCl electrode were used as working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The DP sample pad included both large pores and small pores that allowed rapid detection (\u223c6 min) via concentrated antigen-antibody complexes on the conjugate pad. In addition, small particles like viruses can pass through the sample pad, which gave the ability for virus detection in air samples. An LOD of 3.3 plaque forming units (PFU)/mL and 4.7 PFU/mL (saliva) was obtained using EIS. The integrated device is useful for sensitive, onsite detection of H1N1 viruses in real samples while decreasing false results using simultaneous quantitative and qualitative analysis.",

Then, PDMS was poured onto the master mold and cured to create a microfluidic chamber. Then, ZnO nanorods (NRs) were grown in the three sensor regions of the PDMS channel via hydrothermal method and lift-off process. After the ZnO NRs growth, O 2 plasma treatment was applied to adhere ZnO NRs to the PDMS sensor. An immunosensor chip with three detection zones was achieved by photolithography. Subsequently, capture antibodies of H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9 were immobilized onto the ZnO NRs grown on three sensor regions of the PDMS surface. Finally, H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9 antigens were incubated on sensors followed by injection of detection antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate was oxidized by HRP enzyme resulting in signal production. H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9 influenza viruses were simultaneously detected in a mixture of three virus antigens using three-gold electrodes via amperometry. The limit of detection of each virus using this technique was 1 pg/ml. Real samples were not tested using the system.",

Among these peptides, Au electrode modified with the NoroBP peptide showed the best selectivity toward norovirus using EIS technique with a detection limit of 1.7 copies/mL, which is 3-fold lower than the previously reported methods. Finally, electrochemical behavior of gold electrode coated with 0.3 mg/mL NoroBP peptide was successfully evaluated due to the increased impedance signal with increasing concentration of norovirus extracted from oyster and showed LOD of 2.47 copies/mL. Challenges with antibody-based biosensors.-There are numerous challenges associated with antibody-based biosensor that can largely be divided between reagent and target. The first challenge is generation of consistent high affinity antibodies that selectively target the analyte of interest. Antibodies are notoriously variable from lot to lot, meaning sensors can work with one batch but not the next. Monoclonal antibodies generally have better reproducibility but bind only a single epitope giving rise to potential problems with number of binding sites. Another antibody related problem is immobilization on the surface of the electrode. If care is not given to the method, a significant fraction (up to 75%) can be either denatured or immobilized in a manner that makes antigen binding impossible. Careful consideration of immobilization techniques and blocking for non-specific adsorption is required. Finally, antibodies can lack stability relative to DNA/RNA reagents and often require cold storage to maintain shelf life. Increased temperatures, ionic concentrations, and reducing agents can inactivate antibodies on sensor surfaces and dramatically reduce the efficacy of the sensor. Therefore, appropriate buffer composition and temperature control are critical considerations in the use of antibody-based sensors.",

Viruses are notorious for both mutating to change their coat proteins and for having coat proteins that are very similar. For the former, one need only consider influenza. New flu vaccines are needed each year because a new influenza variant appears almost every year. This makes creating antibodies against the mutating species very difficult. Likewise, the similarity of coat proteins across virus serotypes is a significant challenge for selective antibody-based sensors. For example, there are four main dengue virus, and creating antibodies that can distinguish between these serotypes is non-trivial. Careful selection and treatment of antibodies used on biosensors is critical for successful detection.",

Then, a mixture of mercaptohexadecanoic acid (MHDA) and 1,6hexanedithiol (HDT) were applied on the gold electrode surface to form a nanowell-based electrode. Moreover, EDC and NHS were used for further treatment to immobilize NH 2 -aptamers via amide bond on the electrode surface. The immobilization of aptamers was enhanced fivefold using a nanowell-based electrode compared to the electrode without the nanowells. The aptasensor detected AIV H5N1 as low as 2 \u22124 hemagglutination units (HAUs)/50 \u03bcl and had linear range 2 \u22124 to 2 4 HAUs/50 \u03bcl. The aptasensor specificity was demonstrated with non-target AIV subtypes H7N2, H1N1, H5N3, and H2N2 and was verified by detection of AIV H5N1 in chicken tracheal swab samples. The detection time using the nanowell-based QCM aptasensor was reduced to 10 min from 2 hr using a label-free assay compared to other reported QCM immunosensors/aptasensors for detection of AIVs. 116 Bai et al. developed an electrochemical impedance aptasensor to detect H1N1 virus particles ( Figure 3B ). 117 The aptamer selective to H1N1 was identified and used on the surface of modified gold electrode. The detection limit was 0.9 pg/\u03bcL with the higher probe density. Since the affinity of the selected aptamer depended on probe density, the biosensor demonstrated response toward H1N3 and influenza B virus. Therefore, this work was not suitable for subtyping. However, Bhardwaj and coworkers reported more specific label-free electrochemical aptasensor for subtyping of influenza A H1N1 virus. 118 A ssDNA aptamer, which enables to detect a wide range of influenza A H1N1 subtypes, was developed. Indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass strips were pretreated with NH 4 OH, H 2 O 2 , and H 2 O to generate hydroxyl groups on the ITO surface. The electrode was modified with 1% polyethylenimine followed by aptamer adsorption. DPV was performed for detection of the H1N1 virus using [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3\u2212/4\u2212 as the redox probe between the potential \u22120.8 V and +0.8 V with a scan rate of 100 mVs \u22121 . The LOD of the aptasensor for H1N1 viruses was 3.7 PFU mL \u22121 . The selectivity of the aptasensor was confirmed by distinguishing six strains of H1N1 viruses from four different subtypes of influenza A viruses. The detection of H1N1 virus using this aptasensor is faster than the standard ELISA and nucleic acid-based techniques.",

Oligonucleotide-based aptamers have the added benefit of being able to re-fold into their active structures if the sensor surface encounters harsh conditions (increased ionic strength solutions, denaturing reagents, increased temperatures). 120 This can allow sensors using aptamers as the affinity reagent to potentially be re-used, increasing the utility and decreasing the costs associated with the assays. Therefore, aptamers possess significant advantages as sensor-coupled affinity reagents compared to protein-based affinity reagents. However, several challenges do exist with the use of aptamers that should be considered. The most significant problem with aptamers, however, is the lack of known aptamers for virus detection related sensing. The number of high affinity aptamers is very limited relative to the number of antibodies and development of new aptamers takes time and specialized knowledge limiting the rate at which new reagents are reported. Another issue that should be considered with nucleic acidbased aptamers, especially RNA based aptamers, is degradation by RNAse enzymes. RNAses are relatively ubiquitous and care should be taken to protect RNA aptamers from degradation by RNAses, which would reduce the sensitivity of the sensor. This can be mitigated by addition of RNAse inhibitors (such RiboLock) with the analyte during sensing. DNA and 2'O-modified aptamers tend to be less sensitive to nuclease digestion and can be used without additional nuclease inhibitors.",

            "text": "Another strategy for virus detection is to modify electrodes with antigens to detect circulating antibodies. Wang et al. developed a sensitive method for detecting Zika virus specific antibodies using non-faradaic capacitance sensing ( Figure 4A ). 121 Zika virus (ZIKV) is a member of the Flaviviridae family (genus Flavivirus) that has been rapidly spreading across the globe through Aedes mosquito vector and sexual transmission. ZIKV was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2016 by the World Health Organization (WHO) due to the expanded outbreaks throughout much of the Americas. 122,123 ZIKV has been detected in blood, 124 semen, 124 urine, 125 saliva 126 and breast milk 127 of infected patients. The biosensor consisted of a glass substrate with a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer, and a two electrode system including gold and Ag/AgCl microwires. The gold microwires were modified with MUA. The electrode surface was activated using NHS/EDC followed by functionalizing with Zika virus (ZIKV E) or Chikungunya virus (CHIKV E) envelope antigen. The change in the total capacitance was measured due to the binding of antibody to antigen. The detection limit was approximately 10 antibody molecules in a 30 \u03bcL sample and the sensor was able to distinguish antibody isotypes. Also, the platform was used for specific, sensitive detection of polyclonal anti-ZIKV antibodies available in mouse serum. The developed technique is more advantageous than other immunosensors or ELISA assays because of its superior detection limit.",

Also, radioactive labels, toxic dyes, and expensive instrumentation are not necessary with electrochemical biosensors. Nowadays various nanomaterials such as gold nanoparticles, carbon nanomaterials, magnetic nanoparticles or magnetic beads, quantum dots and hybrid nanostructures have been employed for fabrication of biosensors to enhance their sensitivity and stability. Also, microarrays integrated with microfluidic systems usually provide low-cost fabrication and simultaneous viral detection.
