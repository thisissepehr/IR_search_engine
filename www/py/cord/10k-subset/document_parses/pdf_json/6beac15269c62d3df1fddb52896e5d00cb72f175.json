Zika virus then suddenly and unexpectedly surged, and the virus was spread around the world by a nonsylvatic-vector mosquito, the globally ubiquitous Aedes aegypti. This is the same mosquito that also has transmitted yellow fever, dengue, and chikungunya viruses around the world. A. aegypti is intensely anthropophilic (preferring blood meals from human beings as opposed to other animal hosts). While human travel and population growth and crowding clearly have played an important role in Zika's emergence, these factors alone seem insufficient to explain its sudden pandemicity, since the virus has apparently long persisted in populous and mobile urbanized Asian/Southeast Asian countries with hyperabundant A. aegypti mosquitoes [4] .

These include the ability to cause congenital infections and marked teratogenicity; to be simultaneously viscerotropic and neurotropic, causing not only dengue-like febrile illnesses, but also neurologic conditions, such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and encephalitis [15] ; to transmit sexually; and to persist for long periods in multiple sites of the body.",

The epidemic of congenital Zika syndrome represents not only a profound medical tragedy, but a societal challenge, as well: thousands of parents and caregivers will need financial, medical, and social support for decades to come. In this regard, it is worth reflecting upon and studying the rubella epidemic of the mid 1960s, when tens of thousands of babies were born with congenital rubella syndrome in the United States [23] , the deadliest epidemic of infectious birth defects ever documented. Study of this rubella epidemic and the ongoing occurrences of other congenital infections, such as cytomegalovirus infection, have made clear the importance of understanding Zika through large-scale prospective epidemiologic studies, such as those now underway in the Americas.",

At least 7 different Zika vaccines are currently (in late 2017) in clinical trials, with \u226540 more in preclinical development [25, 26] . Zika vaccine trials face significant challenges, including the fact that the Zika pandemic is waning in many areas and that flavivirus outbreaks normally appear sporadically and unexpectedly. Furthermore, it is unknown which of several possible vaccination strategies is optimal, eg, inducing sterilizing immunity in vulnerable individuals, protecting pregnant women by vaccine induction of population herd immunity, or vaccinating children to induce partial population immunity [25] .
