            "text": "The results of cAMP determination as a function of time, post infection, are shown in Figure 1 . The sharp rise of cAMP after 30 minutes in the infected cultures was not observed either in uninfected cells or cells treated with TGE virus inactivated with 0.1 per cent ~-propiolactone. However, the increase in cAMP level is not proportional to viral input and at m.o.i, of 10 p.f.u., the initial rise of cAMP at 30 minutes post infection is 50 per cent lower than the corresponding value at m.o.i. ~ 0.1, but this elevated intracellular level persists till 12 hours post infection. Such a rise of intracellular cAMP suggested its function as being either a membrane response to the viral infection or its involvement in a possible derepression of cell genome required for viral expression. For this reason, it was decided to investigate the effect of exogenously added cAMP on the TGE specific RNA synthesis. The TGE specific I~NA synthesis was measured by the amount of acid insoluble (all) incorporation in the vitally infected cells at different intervals following a 120 minutes pulse of (~H) uridine in the presence of actinomycin D. The detailed procedure has been described elsewhere (6) . Briefly, the PPK cells were treated with 2 ~g/ml actinomycin for one hour, followed by the addition of the cyclic nucleotide. One hour after the addition of the nucleotide, TGE virus infection was carried out (m. o.i. = 1) for 15 minutes. After washing, fresh media containing appropriate concentrations of actinomycin D and cAMP or dibutyryl cAMP (db-cAMP) were added to each culture and incubated at 37 ~ C. Two hours prior to harvesting each series of culture was pulsed with 2.5 ~Ci/ml (sH) uridine. The cells were washed, lysed in 0.5 per cent sodium dodecyl sulfate, and precipitated with 5 per cent TCA. The acid insoluble precipitate was collected on nitrocellulose membrane filters, dissolved in Protosol and counted with Aquasol scintillation fluid (New England Nuclear, Chicago, Illinois). Under the experimental conditions used, no significant amount of (3H) uridine incorporation over basal uptake can be detected in uninfected cultures. Figure 2 a shows the effect of 1, 10, and 100 ~g/ml of cAMP on the kinetics of viral RNA synthesis. Figure 2 b shows that the effect can be duplicated by its analogue--db-cAMP. The db-cAMP is more effective than cAMP at 1 ~g level, but not at 10 ~zg level. At 100 ~g/ml concentrations both cAMP and db-cAMP altered the pattern of viral synthesis. When a dose response curve is constructed, it is found that cAMP levels between 1--10 [zg proportionally increased peak radioactive uptake at 10 hours post infection but not at concentrations exceeding 10 9g/ml. In phage infected bacteria, the intracellular cyclic AMP level has been suggested as the regulator which makes the decision between lysogeny and lysis (7) . OTTEN et al. (8) have shown that a fall in cAMP level may precede the morphological changes in fibroblasts when they are transformed by Rous Sarcoma virus. The present investigation indicates the possibility that a successful lyric infection may be preceded by a rise in cAMP.",
