Pneumocystis was diagnosed by microscopy using Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver stain in 12 cases and by nested PCR using mtLSUrRNA in 25 cases. Genotyping was performed using three different genes, mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal RNA (mtLSUrRNA), dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). mtLSUrRNA genotype 3 and novel mutations at the gene target DHFR (401 T > C) and DHPS 96/98 were frequently observed and clinically associated with severe pCp and treatment failure. phylogenetic analyses revealed 13 unique sequence types (STs). Two STs (i) 3-DHFR 401 T > C-DHPS 96/98 -PJ1 and (ii) 3-DHFR 401 T > C-DHPS 96-PJ3 were significantly associated with treatment failure and high mortality among PCP-positive patients.

Recently, P. jirovecii infection has also been considered a risk factor for high mortality among children 5 . A study performed on Mozambican children showed that PCP seemed to be associated with worsening disease in comparison to non-PCP children 21 . Molecular characterization of P. jirovecii and its associated genotypes with clinical characteristics has been a matter of intense research to strategize an effective method to control the disease. In the present study, we performed multilocus sequence typing targeting unique combinations of genes, including a gene involved in metabolic functions (mtLSUrRNA gene) and two enzymatic targets (genes) of therapeutic agent trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (DHFR and DHPS). Only 12 patients were positive by microscopic examination (GMS) out of 37 patients who were positive by mt LSU rRNA nested PCR assay. All microscopy-positive PCP cases had fatal outcomes. The remaining 25 cases were clinically documented cases of PCP, as all these cases had a high index of clinical suspicion of Pneumocystis pneumonia at the time of presentation and further supported by a positive PCR assay. In this context, studies have previously reported that microscopy-negative PCP cases may also be addressed as possible or probable cases under the following conditions: (i) if clinical findings are consistent with PCP, (ii) if they are positive by PCR (mtLSUrRNA) assay, and (iii) if resolution of symptoms with empiric anti-Pneumocystis therapy observed [22] [23] [24] . Furthermore, of these 25 clinically documented cases of PCP, 54% (20/37) patients responded to anti-Pneumocystis treatment, and 13.5% (5/37) succumbed to death because of severe pneumonia resulting in respiratory failure. Moreover, nested PCR assays targeting mtLSUrRNA for PCP diagnosis have been considered more sensitive than microscopic examinations performed by GMS staining or single-step PCR assays if the patients were clinically symptomatic, i.e., clinically documented PCP cases [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . In the context of colonization, a recently published study from Poland, performed on Pneumocystis colonized cases, stated that P. jirovecii-colonized patients were defined as individuals who did not have clinical symptoms or radiological signs of PCP 30 .

Considering underlying disease severity and PCP as one of the important antecedent causes of death, the highest mortality was observed among patients who presented with severe pneumonia (9/16; 56.25%), followed by 50% mortality among patients with autoimmune disorders and with immune deficiencies (3/6), 40% in patients with HIV (2/5), and 30% among patients with malignant disorders (3/10).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 358, "end": 359, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 500, "end": 502, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1739, "end": 1743, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1744, "end": 1748, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1749, "end": 1753, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2245, "end": 2249, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2250, "end": 2254, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2255, "end": 2259, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2260, "end": 2264, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2265, "end": 2269, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2523, "end": 2525, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2714, "end": 2716, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3062, "end": 3070, "text": "(Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Worldwide, mtLSUrRNA genotypes 2 and 3 have been associated with severe Pneumocystis pneumonia and have fatal outcomes 32, 33 .
