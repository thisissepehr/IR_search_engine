We propose to use the difference between accurately predicted and observed retention times for each peptide as a metric to evaluate different quality control methods. To this end, we develop AutoRT, a deep learning algorithm with high accuracy in retention time prediction. Analysis of three cancer data sets with a total of 287 tumor samples using different quality control strategies results in substantially different numbers of identified variant peptides and putative neoantigens. Our systematic evaluation, using the proposed retention time metric, provides insights and practical guidance on the selection of quality control strategies. We implement the recommended strategy in a computational workflow named NeoFlow to support proteogenomics-based neoantigen prioritization, enabling more sensitive discovery of putative neoantigens.",

This is achieved by simultaneously performing whole-exome sequencing (WES), RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)-based shotgun proteomics analysis on matched samples, producing customized, sample-specific protein databases from DNA, and/or RNA sequencing data, and then searching MS/MS data against the customized protein databases. In contrast to proteomics data analysis that relies on reference protein databases alone, this approach allows the identification of peptides not included in reference protein databases, providing new opportunities to improve protein-coding genome annotation 4, 5 and to identify disease-specific protein sequences [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .",

To identify neoantigens for personalized vaccine development, WES of matched tumor-and normal-cell DNA from individual patients has been used to identify somatic mutations, followed by prioritization of mutated alleles by RNA-Seq profiling of the tumor and subsequent in silico prediction of the binding affinity between putative neoantigens and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 15, 16 . Because MHC binds peptides rather than RNA molecules, validation of mutated alleles through proteomic profiling will likely provide more functionally and clinically relevant neoantigens for prioritization.",

            "text": "Successful application of the proteogenomic approach to neoantigen prioritization relies on sensitive and reliable identification of variant peptides in proteomics data. In proteomics data analysis using reference protein databases, quality control is critical and achieved by estimating false discovery rate (FDR) using the target-decoy strategy 17 . Directly applying this strategy to proteogenomic studies without discriminating reference and variant peptides would underestimate the true FDR for variant peptides because the likelihood of experimentally observing a variant peptide is lower than that of a reference peptide. Thus, this global FDR method is prone to false-positive variant peptide identifications 3 . To address this issue, two alternative FDR estimation methods have been proposed. The separate FDR method calculates FDRs for known and variant peptides separately 18, 19 . The two-stage FDR method involves two stages: in the first stage, the MS/MS data are searched against a reference protein database, and the confidently identified spectra are removed; in the second stage, the remaining spectra are searched against the variant protein database, and the FDR for variant peptides is calculated based on the second stage search results 20, 21 . The separate FDR and two-stage FDR methods calculate FDRs based on a small number of identifiable variant peptides, which may generate highly variable estimates. The two-stage FDR method is further vulnerable to false negatives because an MS/MS spectrum generated from a variant peptide may be incorrectly matched to a reference peptide in the first stage and excluded from the second stage analysis. Moreover, a common limitation for all three methods is that false positives may occur when a spectrum matched to a variant peptide is actually derived from a reference peptide containing a chemical or post-translational modification that was not considered in database searching.",

SAVControl provides site-level quality control of single aminoacid variant (SAV) peptide identifications. It relocates the mass shift responsible for a SAV to search for alternative interpretations. SpectrumAI is specifically designed to curate SAV peptide identifications using the ions flanking both sides of the substituted amino acid. PepQuery is a peptide-centric search engine for novel peptide validation, including SAV peptides and other types of novel peptides such as those derived from INDELs. For each peptide-spectrum match (PSM), a permutation p value is calculated based on randomly shuffled peptide sequences to evaluate the statistical significance of the PSM score. The peptidecentric analysis in PepQuery also allows comprehensive consideration of sequence modifications during the analysis. In general, all three tools can help reduce false positives, but they cannot rescue false negatives.",

            "text": "Applying different quality control strategies to the same proteomics data may result in different numbers of identified variant peptides, obscuring neoantigen prioritization and other downstream proteogenomic applications. Recent studies have compared different FDR estimation methods for novel peptide identification 21, 24, 25 . Li et al. 24 and Ivanov et al. 25 utilized spikein data sets in which spiked-in proteins were considered as novel proteins. Sequences of spiked-in proteins are usually very different from those in the reference database. In contrast, most variant proteins identified in proteogenomic studies only involve very minor sequence changes compared with the reference sequences, such as SAVs. These minor sequence changes cannot be well-represented by spiked-in proteins. Moreover, existing studies have only evaluated different FDR estimation methods in label-free experiments, but many cancer proteogenomic studies involve isobaric labeling 7,10,12 . The conclusions from the labelfree studies may not be generalizable to isobaric labeling-based experiments because of sample multiplexing. In addition, variant peptide validation tools introduced more recently were not included in these evaluation studies. Thus, despite the wide application of these approaches, there remains a lack of evidencebased consensus on the best bioinformatics strategy for controlling the quality of variant peptide identifications. A key challenge is the lack of an appropriate metric for systematic and unbiased performance evaluation.",

If the RT can be predicted with high accuracy for all peptides, the predicted RT of the peptide in each PSM can be compared with the observed RT associated with the spectrum to determine the quality of the PSMs. Although several studies have shown the value of integrating RT information into the proteomics data analysis workflow 26, [32] [33] [34] [35] , RT is typically not used in peptide identification and is independent of the FDR estimation.

Our systematic evaluation based on the analysis of 57 million spectra generated on three popular MS platforms using three search engines provides insights and practical information to guide method selection for future proteogenomic studies.

In order to systematically evaluate quality control strategies in proteogenomics, we used three large-scale data sets from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) colon cancer 10 and breast cancer studies 7 , including one label-free data set, one TMT data set, and one iTRAQ data set. The label-free data set includes 90 colon tumor samples and a total of 16,804,000 MS/MS spectra. The TMT data set includes 21 TMT 10-plex experiments on 94 colon tumor samples from the same cohort as the label-free data set and a total of 9,097,679 MS/MS spectra. The iTRAQ data set includes 36 iTRAQ 4-plex experiments on 103 breast tumor samples and a total of 31,231,980 MS/MS spectra. Matched WES data of the tumor samples were used for customized database construction. For the label-free study, we built one customized database for each tumor sample. For the TMT and iTRAQ studies, we built one customized database for each TMT or iTRAQ experiment based on WES data of all individual tumor samples in the TMT 10-plex or iTRAQ 4-plex. For the purpose of method evaluation, we included both germline and somatic variants in the customized databases. We used three popular search engines, MS-GF+, X! Tandem, and Comet, for database searching, and FDR estimation was performed at the peptide level using three FDR estimation methods: global FDR, separate FDR, and two-stage FDR, all with a threshold of 1%. PepQuery was included as an optional step to validate the variant peptides that passed the FDR threshold. Variant peptides reported by different quality control strategies were evaluated based on the difference between observed RT and predicted RT, which was calculated using the AutoRT deep learning models as described below.",

The highly accurate RT predictions made by AutoRT in the label-free, TMT, and iTRAQ experiments enabled the use of predicted RT in the evaluation of the quality of variant peptide identifications. The numbers of variant peptides identified for individual labelfree samples using different search engines and quality control strategies are shown in Fig. 3a . Results from all three search engines showed similar trends across samples. On average, global FDR identified more variant peptides than the other two FDR estimation methods for all three search engines, both with and without PepQuery validation, and separate FDR identified more variant Tandem   01  02  03  04  05  06  07  08  09  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34 peptides than two-stage FDR (Fig. 3b ). These results are consistent with our understanding of the different levels of stringency of the three FDR estimation methods. Across the three search engines, an average of 8-14% variant peptides identified by global FDR failed PepQuery validation, and the failure rates were 5-12% for separate FDR and 3-8% for two-stage FDR. Using the numbers of variant peptides reported by global FDR without PepQuery validation, the strategy with the highest sensitivity, as 100%, the other quality control strategies reported 56-94% variant peptide identifications. We repeated the analyses on the 21 TMT and 36 iTRAQ experiments, respectively ( Fig. 3c-f ). Similar to our observation in the label-free data set, global FDR identified more variant peptides than the other two FDR estimation methods for all three search engines, both with and without PepQuery validation, and separate FDR identified more variant peptides than two-stage FDR. Although the label-free and TMT experiments were performed on the same cohort of colon tumor specimens, we identified three-to fourfold more variant peptides in individual TMT experiments compared to individual label-free samples across all settings. This was expected because each TMT experiment included multiplexed samples, increasing the diversity of variants. For the TMT data, an average of 7-11% variant peptides identified by global FDR failed PepQuery validation across the three search engines, and the failure rates were 4-7% for separate FDR and 2-4% for two-stage FDR (Fig. 3d ). Using the numbers of variant peptides reported by global FDR without PepQuery validation as 100%, the other methods reported 42-93% variant peptide identifications. For the iTRAQ data, an average of 6-8% variant peptides identified by global FDR failed PepQuery validation across the three search engines, and the failure rates were 3-5% for separate FDR and 1-2% for two-stage FDR (Fig. 3f ). Using the numbers of variant peptides reported by global FDR without PepQuery validation as 100%, other methods reported 59-94% variant peptide identifications. Together, these data showed that applying different quality control strategies to the same data set may lead to substantially different numbers of identified variant peptides.",

Using the difference between accurately predicted peptide RT and observed RT as a quantitative metric, we demonstrated that among all quality control strategies investigated, global FDR control followed by PepQuery validation offered the highest sensitivity while identifying high quality variant peptides. We thus recommend this quality control strategy for variant peptide identification and neoantigen prioritization in future proteogenomic studies. There is a large variation in the numbers of putative neoantigens reported by the three search engines; combining results from multiple search engines can effectively maximize putative neoantigen identifications. Moreover, RT-based validation provides an additional filter to reduce false positives.

            "text": "A major contribution of this study is the development of AutoRT, a deep learning-based RT prediction algorithm, because accurately predicted RT opens the door to systematic evaluation of variant peptide identifications. Training a deep learning model without using hand-crafted features typically requires a large amount of data to achieve good performance. In most deep proteomics studies, multidimensional liquid chromatographic technologies are used. Each sample is separated into multiple fractions and each fraction of peptides is injected into a mass spectrometer for data acquisition. In our study, the number of identified peptides for a single run ranged from 700 to 10,000 (Fig. 2b-d) , which in general is not large enough to train a peptide sequence-based highperformance deep learning model from scratch. Thus, we developed base models using a large public data set and then used the transfer learning strategy to address the limitation of the small size of the run-specific training data. Combining data from multiple experiment types for training may be able to create a single model that can handle experiment-specific parameters; however, this cannot replace transfer learning because nonlinear RT shift between different runs occurs frequently even when the same LC system is used for all runs in a study (Supplementary Fig. 7) . Another challenge is the design of the neural network architecture because the optimal architecture is not known a priori. We addressed this challenge by using evolutionary computation to automatically search for an optimal architecture. Consistent with previous studies 21, 24, 25 , we found that twostage FDR control was more stringent than separate FDR control, which was in turn more stringent than global FDR control. Interestingly, our results showed that even the most stringent twostage FDR control still benefited from PepQuery validation. One of the most important features of PepQuery is competitive filtering based on unrestricted modification searching in which >1000 modifications are considered, which effectively addresses the common limitation of all FDR estimation methods. As expected, global FDR control benefited the most from PepQuery validation because it underestimates FDR for variant peptide identifications. Nevertheless, its combination with PepQuery validation provided the highest sensitivity without compromising reliability.",

This may be explained by different reasons such as inaccurate RT prediction and wide elution time range for some peptides, and false-variant peptide identification is also a possible explanation. Therefore, the RT errors included in the final report of NeoFlow provide orthogonal information that facilitates candidate prioritization for experimental validation. Rather than using RT errors as an optional feature to filter PSMs, a moreeffective approach to improve peptide identification is to incorporate AutoRT-derived delta RT as a feature into PSM scoring in combination with other features. However, such implementation will require graphics processing units (GPUs) for PSM scoring, and thus will be more useful when GPUs are widely accessible in proteomics laboratories.",

Variants annotated by ANNOVAR were filtered for protein-altering events including nonsynonymous SNVs, frameshift INDELs, non-frameshift INDELs, and stop-loss. For label-free data, we built a customized database for each individual tumor sample based on germline and somatic variants from matched WES data. For TMT or iTRAQ data, we built a customized database for each TMT or iTRAQ multiplexed sample based on germline and somatic variants from WES data derived from corresponding tumor samples in the TMT or iTRAQ plex. Customized database construction was performed using our JAVA-based tool, customProDBJ. customProDBJ is easier to use compared with our previously published R-based tool customProDB 44 . In addition, customProDBJ includes a redundancy removal feature that is particularly useful for constructing non-redundant customized databases in TMT and iTRAQ studies. For each TMT or iTRAQ sample, customProDBJ takes all ANNOVAR annotated files associated with the tumor samples in the TMT plex or iTRAQ plex as input. The same variant from different tumor samples is identified and only one variant protein sequence for each variant is retained in the customized database for the TMT or iTRAQ sample.

We used the target-decoy search strategy 17 implemented in PGA 46 (https://github.com/wenbostar/PGA) to estimate FDR. Reversed target protein sequences were used to build a decoy database. FDR estimation was calculated by dividing the number of decoy hits by the number of target hits above a score threshold. All the results were filtered with 1% FDR at peptide level.

Given that MS2 scans can sometimes be taken rather early or rather late in the peak elution, the RT of the MS1 peak maximum of the respective precursor ion can better represent the observed retention time for a peptide. However, the search results from the peptide identification tools used in this study (MS-GF+, X!Tandem, and Comet) do not contain the RT of the MS1 peak maximum of the respective precursor, and it is time consuming to extract MS1 peak maximum-based RT from the raw data for all experiments. We considered an alternative option, which is to use the average of RTs from all spectra identified from the same run with 1% FDR at both PSM and peptide levels for a peptide to represent observed RT for the peptide. To evaluate the accuracy of this MS2-based method, we selected identification results from three runs from each of the three CPTAC data sets and extracted the RT of MS1 peak maximum of the respective precursor ions of identified peptides using FlashLFQ (v1.0.2) 56 . As shown in Supplementary Figs. 8-10, the difference between the RTs estimated based on the MS2 and the MS1 methods was <10 sec for >90, 87, and 95% of the peptides identified in the label-free, TMT, and iTRAQ data, respectively. Moreover, the accuracies of AutoRT were similar when the two types of observed RTs were used for the analysis.

Variants in the VCF format are annotated using ANNOVAR, and the annotated files are used as input to customProDBJ in order to build a customized protein database; (2) Variant peptide identification including MS/MS searching, FDR estimation, PepQuery validation, and optional RT-based validation. Three search engines, MS-GF+, X!Tandem, and Comet, are available in NeoFlow for peptide identification. FDR estimation is performed based on the global FDR estimation method. All variant peptides passing the 1% global FDR threshold are further validated using PepQuery, and only those with PepQuery p value \u22640.01 are retained. In addition, if germline variants are considered in the customized database construction, a somatic variant peptide will be removed if it can be exactly mapped to a germline variant peptide. For RT-based validation, an RT prediction model is trained for each single run using all identified reference peptides as training data for AutoRT. The trained model is then used to predict the RTs of the variant peptides. The difference between observed RT and predicted RT is taken as an additional quality metric for each PSM. Because AutoRT requires GPUs that are not available in many proteomics labs, this feature is optional in NeoFlow; (3) HLA typing. Because HLA-peptide binding affinity is affected by both peptide sequence and HLA type, HLA type needs to be specified as an input for binding affinity prediction in step 4. HLA typing in NeoFlow is performed by Optitype, which uses WXS data in the FASTQ format as input; (4) MHC-binding prediction and neoantigen prioritization. netMHCpan 58 is used to predict HLA-peptide binding affinity for all somatic mutation-derived variant peptides with a length between 8-11 amino acids, except for those that can be exactly matched to a reference protein. Following previous publications 15, 59 , NeoFlow uses IC 50 binding affinity of 150 nM as a threshold to identify HLA-peptide pairs with strong binding affinity. This information is combined with variant peptide identification information acquired from steps 1-3 for neoantigen prioritization. NeoFlow was implemented into a workflow using nextflow (https://www.nextflow.io/) 60 and is available at https://github.com/bzhanglab/neoflow.",

As shown inFig. 5c, f, i, P1 peptides showed significantly lower absolute RT error than F peptides in all comparisons (p < 0.0001, one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test). In contrast, there was no statistically significant difference between P1 peptides and P2 peptides for eight out of the nine comparisons. These data suggest that variant peptides uniquely reported by global FDR were of high quality as long as they passed PepQuery validation. Thus, global FDR control followed by PepQuery validation offered the highest sensitivity without compromising the quality of variant peptide identifications.",
