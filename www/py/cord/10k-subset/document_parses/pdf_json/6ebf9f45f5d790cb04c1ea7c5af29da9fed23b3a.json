Mechanical ventilation (MV) is the only known effective method to support patients' lives during general anesthesia and is the cornerstone therapy for acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The mechanisms implicated in VILI include high inspiratory volumes (\"volutrauma\"), mechanical stress-induced inflammation (\"biotrauma\") and cyclical airway collapse and reopening [2] . As early as 1988, Dreyfuss et al. [3] reported novel data demonstrating to the critical care community that MV with large tidal volume is injurious, coining the term \"volutrauma.\" This terminology proved useful as it emphasizes that peak lung volume and tidal volume are better surrogates for lung stress than peak airway pressure, plateau airway pressure or airway pressure swings.",

            "text": "Emerging evidence suggests a role for antioxidant and oxidant imbalance in the exacerbation of lung injury and 1 3 inflammation caused by various injurious insults, including MV [4] [5] [6] [7] . The production of high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generally leads to oxidative stress. ROS act both as a direct cell toxin and as a secondary messenger that modulates intracellular signaling, causing activation of a cascade of inflammation, neutrophil infiltration and cytokine production, while simultaneously causing apoptosis by activating c-JunN-terminal kinase (JNK). The induction of cytoprotective antioxidant enzymes in response to injurious insults or stressful stimuli is critical in the cellular detoxification of ROS and in the maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis. Specific biological defense systems, including catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione (GSH), exist in the lung to counteract oxidative stress [8] . These enzymes are regulated by the transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like (Nrf2) and a number of speedlimited synthetic enzymes. Nrf2 regulates cellular redox status via the antioxidant response element, and genetic disruption of this transcription factor enhances the susceptibility of various experimental murine models to prooxidant-induced lung diseases. These effects are primarily due to decreased levels of the basal and inducible expression of several critical antioxidant enzymes, including the glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLc), glutamate cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLm) and sulfiredoxin-1 (Srx1) [9] .",

Based on these observations, we hypothesized that redox imbalance caused by conventional MV might relate to the tidal volume, which in turn might promote and/or perpetuate the pathogenesis of VILI.

Briefly, 8-week-old male rats were anesthetized intraperitoneally with 10 % chloral hydrate (3 ml per kg body weight), and a supplemental anesthetic was provided regularly at approximately 1 ml/kg per hour as maintenance during the experimental period. Rectal temperatures were continuously monitored and maintained at 37 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C by a recirculating heating blanket (ALC-HTP; Alcott Biotech Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China), and the heart rate was monitored via a lead II electrocardiograph. A pulse oximeter (Radical; Masimo, Irvine, CA) was placed on a shaved foreleg. A midline incision of the neck was performed to expose the trachea to facilitate endotracheal intubation with a 16-gauge, 10-cmlong catheter. The right carotid artery was exposed and cannulated for invasive blood pressure monitoring, and a tail vein was cannulated with an intravenous cannula (24G) for fluid infusion and anesthetic administration. The rats were randomly divided into three ventilation (treatment) groups, with 12 rats in each group. The rats in groups C1, C2 and C3 were subjected to MV (Inspira ASV; Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) for 2 h with a tidal volume of 8, 30 or 42 ml/kg, respectively. The tidal volumes and the duration of ventilation were based on the results of pilot experiments which demonstrated that these conditions caused VILI in rats with reproducible alterations in lung mechanics and inflammation. The respiratory rates for each group were selected to achieve normal values for end-tidal carbon dioxide (E T CO 2 ) (BeneView T5; Mindray Medical Int. Ltd., Shenzhen, China) (maintained between 35-45 mm Hg) based on the preliminary experiments. The control group (C) consisted of shamoperated, anesthetized and spontaneously breathing rats. The MV rats were ventilated with room air. Each animal was euthanized by exsanguination under anesthesia, disconnected from the ventilator, and then a thoracotomy was performed. The heart-lung block was removed. The lung was harvested and frozen immediately at \u221280 \u00b0C.",

The antioxidant protein levels increased following MV with tidal volumes of 30 and 42 ml/kg. MV is often a necessary treatment for respiratory failure and is a supportive measure in critically ill patients. It is well-known that MV with high volume or pressure may be harmful, causing damage to previously healthy lungs or exacerbating injury in those already damaged. MV with low tidal volume is a lung protective strategy that has been shown to diminish the damage induced by MV in experimental models of ALI/ARDS and to decrease mortality in patients with ALI/ARDS compared with the use of higher tidal volumes. However, some patients develop VILI despite lowvolume MV. The mechanisms responsible for the VILI are complex [12] , but oxidative stress and inflammation mediator (e.g. interleukin-6) play key roles in the pathogenesis of VILI [10] . In our study, MV tidal volume as low as 8 ml/ kg increased MDA levels compared to those of the control group. This result is consistent with those reported previously, which suggested that oxidative stress contributes to VILI [13, 14] . The expression of the antioxidant proteins Nrf2, GCLm and SrX1 in lung tissue of the ventilated rat lungs was also upregulated in parallel with increasing tidal volumes.",

During MV, there are many potential oxidant-producing sources, including leukocytes, parenchymal cells, prooxidant enzymes, as well as the high oxygen concentration in the gases inhaled during MV. Neutrophils release free radicals, which contribute to maintaining the inflammation and inducing a prooxidant state that exceeds the antioxidative defense mechanisms. The tidal volumes used in our study were selected on the basis of earlier studies. We found that the level of MDA in the group subjected to the 8 ml/kg tidal volume (C1) increased by nearly 50 % compared to that of control group, in the 30 ml/kg group (C2), the level of this indicator increased by approximately 80 % compared to that of the 8 ml/kg group and in the 42 ml/kg group (C3) it increased by more than 45 % compared to the 30 ml/ kg group. These results demonstrate that oxidative stress increases rapidly as a function of the increased MV tidal volumes.",

GSH, a major cellular antioxidant, is the central component of the glutathione system. The rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of GSH is glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), formerly called \u03b3-glutamylcysteine synthetase (\u03b3-GCS). GCL is a heterodimer composed of catalytic (GCLc) and regulatory (GCLm) subunits. GCLc possesses all of the catalytic activity and is the site of GSH feedback inhibition. Current evidence suggests that GCLc is responsible for the constitutive synthesis of GSH, while the association of GCLc with GCLm is required to overcome feedback inhibition by GSH when a higher rate of synthesis is required, as may occur during stress [18] . Thus, GCLm is critical for the biosynthesis of GSH [19] . Thioredoxin acts as an antioxidant by controlling cellular redox balance. In this context, thioredoxin promotes cell growth, inhibits apoptosis, modulates inflammation and prevents The level of oxidative stress in lung tissue was measured MDA level. The MDA level was higher in group C1 than in group C (*P < 0.05), higher in group C2 than in group C1 ( # P < 0.05) and higher in group C3 than group C2 (**P < 0.05) human immunodeficiency virus replication [20] . Srx1 is associated with the thioredoxin system. Sulfiredoxin catalyzes the reduction of the sulfinic form of peroxiredoxin (Prx) to the sulfenic acid form, thus restoring the functional cysteine residues and activity of Prx enzymes [21, 22] . Srx1 was the first protein identified as a mediator of the removal of a GSH moiety from proteins, a process also known as deglutathionylation [17, 23] . We found that both the gene transcription and protein expression of Nrf2, GClm and SrX1 were upregulated in the rats ventilated with tidal volumes of 30 and 42 ml/kg, respectively. The antioxidant enzyme expression was greater in the MV group subjected to the 42 ml/kg tidal volume than in the group subjected to the 30 ml/kg procedure (C3 > C2), but no significant difference was found between the rats subjected to the 8 ml/ kg MV (C1) and the control group \u00a9). These results for upregulation of antioxidant enzymes and oxidative stress differed between group C1 and C. It is possible that the antioxidant response is induced by excessive oxidant stress. Alternatively, the antioxidant capacity may be sufficient to maintain homeostasis under the conditions of the 8 ml/kg tidal volume MV but that greater tidal volumes induce the upregulation of the antioxidant response. Another possibility is that the antioxidant may appear as a cascade response when the tidal volume increased.",

The answer is clear: \"it depends.\" Currently, there are no pharmacological treatments that can act synergistically with protective MV strategies to minimize or prevent VILI.
