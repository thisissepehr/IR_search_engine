The precise site(s) of antigen processing and subsequent MHC loading with antigen are not completely defined. A complex picture has emerged, indicating the existence of multiple pathways of Ag/MHC assembly [4, 51. Most commonly, a distinction between two principal pathways, utilized for the loading of Class I and I1 molecules has been recognized [6-81. The access of the antigen to specific intracellular compartments is [I 141061 thought to be critical in determining whether it is presented in association with MHC class I or I1 molecules.

Autophagosomes are thought to arise from the ER and have been implicated in the turnover of the ER proteins, glucosidase I1 and cytochrome P-450 [43, 601. In fact, there is evidence that enhanced protein degradation, observed when cells are starved for serum or nutrients, proceeds by autophagic vesicle formation and fusion of these vesicles to lysosomes [61, 621 which contain acid hydrolases. Plasma membrane, Golgi and endosomal membrane antigens were not found in these vacuoles, in contrast to rough ER lumenal proteins, which were detected in these autophagous vesicles [43] . In a sense, a cell may be considered to be starved upon viral infection due to the production of viral proteins rather than cellular proteins. Therefore, we tested whether the degradation of the mutant glycoprotein occurred in ER, or whether fusion with lysosomes, essential for autophagy, was necessary. Ammonium chloride, which inhibits low-pH dependent lysosomal/endosomal enzymes [44] , leupeptin, a serine-and thiol-protease inhibitor which inhibits lysosomal protease activities without altering intravesicular pH [45] , monensin, and BFA or IQ, reagents that disrupt the integrity of the Golgi [47-491, were added to cultures of vacc-Gpt-infected A20 cells in the presence of a radioactively labeled amino acid. No significant retardation in degradation occurred in the presence of these drugs (Fig. 4) , consistent with the interpretation that the E R is the site of Gpt degradation.

Where does the charging of ER-generated Gpt peptides on class I1 molecules occur? It is possible that Gpt peptides may charge class I1 molecules in the ER, as proposed by Weiss and Bogen [78] for peptides derived from ER proteins. We have recently detected the presentation of epitopes from vacc-Gpt-infected splenic cells derived from Ii-/-mice using either I-Ad or I-Ed restricted T cell hybridomas (manuscript in preparation). In the absence of invariant chain, Aad and APd molecules assemble efficiently and are conformationally similar to mature wild-type heterodimers [7Y]. Alternatively, peptides may traffic with the class I1 molecules into an early Golgi compartment and charge the class I1 molecule there, and then be directly targeted to the surface. Finally, peptides may travel with class I1 to a late endosome/lysosome for charging on a recycling class I1 molecule. Work is in progress to distinguish among these possibilities, One significant aspect of this phenomenon might be the development of T cell tolerance to self proteins, since during development of the T lymphocyte repertoire, peptides derived from intracellular proteins may be generated, leading to negative selection of self-reactive T lymphocytes.
