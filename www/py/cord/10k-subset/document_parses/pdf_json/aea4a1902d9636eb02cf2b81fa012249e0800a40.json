            "text": "Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug used in the treatment of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Three methods to quantify chloroquine and its metabolite in blood matrices were developed and validated. Methodology & results: Different high-throughput extraction techniques were used to recover the drugs from whole blood (50 \u03bcl), plasma (100 \u03bcl) and dried blood spots (15 \u03bcl as punched discs) followed by quantification with LC-MS/MS. The intra-and inter-batch precisions were below 15%, and thus meet regulatory acceptance criteria. Conclusion: The developed methods demonstrated satisfactory validation performance with high sensitivity and selectivity. The assays used simple and easy to automate extraction techniques. All methods were reliable with robust performance and demonstrated to be suitable to implement into high-throughput routine analysis of clinical pharmacokinetic samples.",

            "text": "Malaria is still a major public health problem worldwide, resulting in an estimated 445,000 annual deaths in 2016 [1, 2]. Chloroquine was once the most extensively used antimalarial drug, due to its low cost, high efficacy and relative safety [3] . It was later discontinued for the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum infections in most countries worldwide due to increasing drug resistance [3, 4] . However, it has been reported that a prolonged absence of chloroquine in endemic areas can lead to a reversal of resistance in the parasite population, providing a renewed potential to treat P. falciparum infections [5] . Chloroquine is still the main first-line therapy recommended for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infections [1, 3] . However, chloroquine resistance has been reported in P. vivax in Brazil [6], Ethiopia [7], Indonesia [8], Malaysia (Borneo) [9], Myanmar [10,11], Thailand [12], Papua New Guinea [13] and Peru [14] . Chloroquine belongs to the 4-aminoquinoline group of antimalarial drugs (Figure 1 ). The major active metabolite of chloroquine, generated by CYP450 CYP2C8 and CYP3A4/5 enzymes, is desethylchloroquine [15] . Both chloroquine and desethylchloroquine are slowly eliminated, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 30-60 days [16] . They are mainly bound to platelets, erythrocytes, thrombocytes and granulocytes, similar to other quinoline antimalarial drugs, resulting in increased concentrations in infected or uninfected blood cells that are about two-to five-times higher than what can be found in plasma [16] [17] [18] . Figure 1 shows the molecular structure of chloroquine and desethylchloroquine.",

Early publications of bioanalytical methods commonly used extraction procedures, such as protein precipitation and liquid-liquid extraction, which often leave protein residues in the extracted sample [19, 20, 22, 24, 25, 28] . Liquidliquid extraction is also labor intensive and time consuming. A separation and detection method consisting of LC coupled with UV or fluorescence detection are easy to operate but provide only low sensitivity and selectivity, and often require large sample volumes to achieve adequate sensitivity for quantification of clinical pharmacokinetic samples [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] 28] . A recent publication with diode array detector used a more powerful sample extraction technique",

The introduction of mass spectrometric detection has become popular for its high sensitivity and selectivity that is useful for pharmacokinetic studies. Several mass spectrometric methods have been published for chloroquine determination, but those were simultaneous analysis with other antimalarial drugs [30, 31] . Simultaneous analysis often leads to compromises, for example, a general extraction method needs to be used that can lead to severe matrix effects [30] . A large injection volume to improve sensitivity and prolonged analysis time, for example, 19-21 min/sample due to added chromatography column washout period, to reduce memory effects or sample carryover, were some of the compromises met [30, 31] .",

Identical LC methods were used for the analysis of samples from all three sample matrices (i.e., plasma, whole blood and DBS), enabling a simple and homogeneous method set up irrespective of sample matrix to be analyzed. Previously published bioanalytical methods (Table 1) show lower sensitivity and most often require a large sample volume to achieve adequate sensitivity, and they all have a longer analysis run time for each sample injection [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [28] [29] [30] [31] . The simple separation method developed here results in excellent separation, using cleaner sample extraction techniques and shorter run time of 6.5 min for analysis and better sensitivity.

This phenomenon might occur if the isotope distribution of one compound overlay and interfere with another compound. In this case it is possible that one of the isotopes of chloroquine have a small contribution to chloroquine-D4 that will show its effect at high concentrations [46] [47] [48] [49] 15 for desethylchloroquine and desethylchloroquine-D4, respectively. The collision energy was set to 29 V for all compounds. The developed detection method resulted in an unbiased robust method with high sensitivity. In some cases, a quantifier and a qualifier transition could increase the reliability of the results acquired. However, in this method, the reverse phase column has good retention and separation of chloroquine and desethylchloroquine, and this method also includes a sample clean-up step that further reduces the chance of interference. The quantifierqualifier transition would be required if only protein precipitation and direct injection were used, with none or very little chloroquine and desethylchloroquine separation and retention. Thus, a qualifier transition would be more beneficial to avoid false result. The quantifier and qualifier transitions should also be fairly similar in signal, and for chloroquine, the SRM signal of qualifier transition was roughly a thirdof quantifier signal. This would work for most of the calibration range except around LLOQ level where the signal would be close to undetectable.",

The recoveries differed between matrices and the extraction technique utilized. For DBS recovery, cellulose fibres in Whatman 31 ET Chr (\u03b2-anhydroglucose units with dominant hydroxyl groups) could possibly interact with chloroquine and desethylchloroquine and hence affect the extraction efficiency in the DBS method, resulting in lower recovery than whole blood and plasma methods [50] . Moreover, three extraction techniques, SPE, SLE + and phospholipid removal were evaluated for DBS samples, of which, phospholipid removal was the simplest method to use, which also gave the best recovery. For whole blood, only SPE using a CBA column gave clean enough extracts, which also produced the highest recoveries.

Postcolumn infusion did not show any signs of ion suppression/enhancement for chloroquine or desethylchloroquine and their stable isotope-labeled internal standards ( Figure 2 , represents a DBS-extracted sample injected during postcolumn infusion), generating a matrix factor close to one for all compounds. Minor ion suppression/enhancement was fully compensated by the stable isotope-labeled internal standards, resulting in normalized matrix effects close to one (with low variation) for both chloroquine and desethylchloroquine (Table 2) . Injecting commonly used antimalarial drugs (potentially co-administered in a clinical setting) in a normal LC run did not produce any interfering peaks (data not shown) and should not have any impact on the quantification of chloroquine and desethylchloroquine.

Filter papers with similar properties to the Whatman 31 ET Chr can be used as alternative (i.e., Whatman DMPK-C, 903 Protein as well as Ahlstrom 226). The thinner and denser Whatman 3 MM Chr paper may cause blood to flow out as a noncircular and nonhomogeneous spot, especially at high hematocrit, and is therefore not recommended for the DBS quantification method. The thin paper also absorbed less blood per surface area, causing a blood volume bias when blood discs were punched out from the blood spot compared with the thicker papers. Obviously, mixing papers with different properties in a clinical trial setting will affect the quantification, resulting in incorrect concentrations and loss of accuracy and precision. The different hematocrit levels evaluated (20, 40 and 60%) might affect the physical size of the blood spot depending on the paper used and hence the amount of blood obtained in a punched disc. DBS methods for antimalarial drug studies should be able to cover studies from healthy volunteers to clinical malaria cases with anemia, and the hematocrit range will therefore be very wide. Malaria patients usually have low hematocrit and in severe malaria hematocrit below 20% can be found [51] . However, using whole blood at different hematocrit levels to create DBS and comparing it to a calibration curve with a hematocrit of 45% did not show any major impact on the quantification of chloroquine or desethylchloroquine.

Chloroquine and desethylchloroquine accumulate in erythrocyte cells giving higher concentrations in whole blood compared with plasma [17, 18, 55] . Therefore, the concentration range and ULOQ values were lower in the plasma method compared with the whole blood or DBS methods. No carryover was detected for the developed methods. The selected LLOQ values were clearly visible and gave a response of at least five-times compared with the blank response and easily detected by all three methods [32] . This is illustrated by a representative chromatogram of a DBS sample containing 1.82 ng/ml of chloroquine and 2.95 ng/ml of desethylchloroquine (Figure 3) , resulting in greater than or equal to tenfold signal-to-noise response.

The DBS method was used to analyze 620 samples from children treated with chloroquine for vivax malaria and the plasma method was used to analyze 182 plasma samples from a healthy volunteer study. The selected calibration range for plasma, whole blood and DBS proved suitable for the concentration measurements of the study samples. Below is a representative graph of a pharmacokinetic concentration-time profile in plasma samples from an adult ( Figure 4A ) receiving a single oral dose of chloroquine (600 mg) and from a separate study, a child ( Figure 4B ) bodyweight 22 kg receiving oral chloroquine with a total dose of 1550 mg over 5 days and samples collected as DBS, analyzed using the developed methods. Chloroquine and desethylchloroquine gave maximum concentrations similar to previously described studies [52] [53] [54] 56] , which also reported a C max after 3-9 h and a slow elimination phase due to high volume of distribution into the body's adipose tissue giving a long terminal elimination half-life [16, 52, 53, 57] . Chloroquine concentrations were higher than its metabolite desethylchloroquine ( Figure 4A & B); however, both have the same activity against parasites [58] . Chloroquine is giving higher concentrations in DBS compared with plasma due to its ability to accumulate in red blood cell [16] [17] [18] . The reliability of all validated methods was confirmed by repeated analysis of some of the patient samples, known as incurred sample reanalysis [59] . For incurred sample reanalysis evaluation, patient samples were selected across the concentration profile and analyzed in a separate run [59] . Furthermore, the DBS method enabled capillary finger-prick sampling in a pediatric field study, a pharmacokinetic study that would not have been practically or ethically possible without the development of this analysis method.",

The developed methods use different sample extraction techniques to simplify the extraction procedure for each matrix. However, all methods use identical separation and detection techniques to maximize the sample throughput and allow for implementation of methods in a high-throughput routine clinical trial setting. The DBS methodology enables clinical field trials in vulnerable populations where large volumes are not ethically and/or practically possible, such as small children. Since no centrifugation or cold chain is needed, it also enables pharmacokinetic studies to be performed in rural field sites and at a lower cost. All methods were demonstrated to be robust and reliable when used for drug quantification in clinical patient samples from large pharmacokinetic clinical trials.",

These bioanalytical methods using LC-MS/MS presented here, provided rugged and robust results in both method validation and clinical samples. These new methods are easy to automate, and consequently will reduce the time for processing large number of clinical pharmacokinetic samples. The sample extraction and clean-up step incorporates modern faster sample processing techniques such as, phospholipids removal 96-well plate for DBS sample, and supported liquid extraction 96-well plate for plasma sample. Moreover, clinical studies for malaria treatment are often located in rural areas where sample storage and transportation are more challenging making DBS as a sample collection technique more important. The DBS technique will not only save time and money, it is also very suitable for vulnerable populations such as small children with only a small amount of blood required for analysis.
