This salutary effect of a DI is proposed to be mediated, at least partially, by momentarily increasing the operating length of airway smooth muscle (ASM). Concerningly, this premise is largely derived from a growing body of in vitro studies investigating the effect of stretching ASM by different magnitudes on its contractility. The relevance of these in vitro findings remains uncertain, as the real range of strains ASM undergoes in vivo during a DI is somewhat elusive. In order to understand the regulation of ASM contractility by a DI and to infer on its putative contribution to the bronchodilator effect of a DI, it is imperative that in vitro studies incorporate levels of strains that are physiologically relevant. This review summarizes the methods that may be used in vivo in humans to estimate the strain experienced by ASM during a DI from functional residual capacity (FRC) to total lung capacity (TLC). The strengths and limitations of each method, as well as the potential confounders, are also discussed. A rough estimated range of ASM strains is provided for the purpose of guiding future in vitro studies that aim at quantifying the regulatory effect of DI on ASM contractility.

The measurement relies on the fact that the last part of the inspired air in a breath does not reach the zone of gas-exchanging units. That last part is rather contained in the V D (also called the dead space), which includes the upper airways down to the terminal bronchi. Since air in the V D does not mix with the alveolar gas, the composition of gas at the mouth during an expiration suddenly changes when it transitions from the air that was contained in the V D to the air that was contained in the alveolar space. The volume of air that comes out of the lungs before this transition of air composition is V D .

The measurement of airway resistance (Raw) by whole-body plethysmography (Raw (pleth) ) is routinely performed in laboratories of lung physiology. Raw (pleth) truly represents the resistance attributed to the viscous flow of air passing through the airways. The practical and theoretical principles involved were previously expatiated [113] . Briefly, the subject is enclosed in a hermetic box of known internal volume. The subject is then instructed to pant inside the box into a tube connected to an open shutter and a pneumotachograph. The shutter is then suddenly closed while the subject tries to keep panting. The airflow at the mouth and the pressures at the mouth and inside the box are monitored continuously. The variations of pressure inside the box (DPbox) when the shutter is open reflect corresponding but opposite changes in alveolar pressure (DPalv). Using the law of Boyle-Mariotte (V 1 P 1 \u00bc P 2 V 2 ), the DPbox are converted into changes in volume (DVbox: often called the shift volume). The DVbox happens to be the mirror image of the changes in thoracic gas volume (TGV) caused by rarefaction and compression of air during the panting, which are required to generate the driving pressure (DPalv) that draws air in-and-out of the lungs. When the shutter is closed, the DVbox can be related to the changes in alveolar pressure (DPalv), since DPalv are then the same as the changes in mouth pressure. Once the relationships between both airflow/DVbox (when the shutter is open) and DPalv/DVbox (when the shutter is closed) are known, the DPalv required to accommodate any chosen airflow (usually 1 L/s) can be determined.

The subject is instructed to take a DI to TLC and then to expire slowly (sometimes at a controlled rate) while the flow is being interrupted at the mouth for a short period at specified intervals. The flow at the mouth and P L need to be measured simultaneously. P L is measured conventionally using an oesophageal balloon to estimate pleural pressure and to subtract it from airway opening pressure. During the measurement, the change in lung volume is being tracked by integrating flow. This is required to relate punctual changes in P L caused by the interruptions to the lung volumes at which they were measured. The increase in P L caused by the interruption is the driving pressure required to accommodate the airflow (and the lung tissue flow) just preceding the interruption. Since the resistance attributed to tissue flow (sometimes called tissue viscance) is small [114] , especially during deflation, the rise in P L caused by the interruption of flow is mainly ascribed to the frictional resistance to airflow within the airway tree. By dividing the increase in P L to the flow at the mouth, airway resistance can then be calculated at every lung volume at which the interruption took place.

The strain on the airway wall reported by most methods during the DI refers to the change in perimeter at the apical surface of the epithelium (i.e., the size of the lumen). This is true for imaging methods such as bronchography, HRCT, MRI, and aOCT, but also for the methods relying of physiological measurements, such as V D and resistance (plethysmography, interrupted deflation, acoustic reflection technique, pitot static probe, and FOT). It is important to understand that the change in luminal geometry does not represent precisely the change in perimeter occurring at the middle of ASM. Due to the combined thickness of the epithelium, the lamina propria, and the ASM, the extent by which ASM is stretched during a DI is slightly overestimated when the luminal geometry (radius, diameter, perimeter, and cross-sectional area) is used to calculate the change in ASM length (Fig. 1) . The size of this effect is more prominent in smaller airways. In fact, the size of this effect increases as the ratio of the perimeter measured at the middle of ASM to the perimeter of the lumen increases. The thickening of the airway wall observed in some respiratory disorders also amplifies the size of this effect (Fig. 1 ).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 888, "end": 896, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1217, "end": 1224, "text": "(Fig. 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Lumen Versus Airway Smooth"}, {"text": "Smooth Muscle Alignment. The reported strain (the one estimated in Table 1 ) represents more accurately the radial strain on the airway wall than the longitudinal strain on the ASM. This is because the orientation of ASM within the airway wall varies. Here, I assumed that ASM is arranged in an orthogonal fashion in relation to the long axis of the airways. This assumption is correct for the trachea and the main stem bronchi. However, ASM is oriented differently in smaller airways. The angle of orientation of ASM relative to the long axis of the airways is on average 75 deg [98] . However, this angle is obviously another parameter that is variable from one airway generation to another, as well as from one ASM bundle to another. The implication here is that the strain reported is somewhat overestimated compared to the real strain on the long axis of the ASM bundle. For example, when one assumes a radial airway wall strain (viz., an increase of airway perimeter) of 25% with no longitudinal airway strain (viz., no lengthening of the airway) and an ASM bundle oriented 75 deg off the long axis of the airway, the strain on the long axis of the ASM bundle is 23.5% (Fig. 2) . The magnitude by which ASM strain is overestimated depends on how far off the angle of orientation deviates from 90 deg. The reality, however, is that the airway is also strained on its longitudinal axis (this is discussed below).

Since the cartilage is stiffer than the ASM, the strain is not distributed homogeneously along the entire circumference of the airway. In reality, near 100% of the change in circumference is taken up by 1/3 to 2/3 of the airway wall; the portion occupied by ASM and free of cartilage.

The estimation of ASM strain during a DI from FRC to TLC is sometimes accomplished by measuring a change in volume. This is the case for the methods measuring and comparing V D at different lung volumes. To convert a change in volume into radial airway wall strain (or $ASM longitudinal strain), an additional step is required. This is because not only the caliber but also the length of the airways fluctuates during breathing maneuvers [128] . The relative extent by which the length of the airways elongate and shorten during breathing maneuvers compared to the extent by which they dilate and narrow have been poorly studied. One can assume that the percentage change is equal in every directions; so that the luminal airway volume expands or shrinks isotropically without changing shape during both inflation and deflation. Some experimental data support this assumption [58, [129] [130] [131] . Studies showing that DV D is linearly related to Dlung volume also support this assumption [64, 67] . However, other evidences suggest that it is not always the case [132] . In fact, the accuracy of this assumption seems greatly affected by the starting lung volume and the magnitude of the lung volume excursion [80, 84, 130] . The strain in one direction relative to the other directions is also likely to vary between airways from different individuals and between airways within the same individual. Regardless, the degree by which the deformation of the airways deviates from isotropy obviously affects the precision with which ASM strain can be estimated by these methods. Fig. 1 The changes in luminal geometry overestimate the stretch the ASM undergoes during a deep inspiration (DI). The schematic illustrates a normal (left) and an asthmatic (right) airways at FRC and after a DI to TLC. The dimensions are zoomed but at scale to an average airway of the ten generation. The springs represent lung recoil. They are stretched at TLC relative to FRC. The arrow at approximately 2 o'clock is the radius (in mm) of the airway lumen (r L ). The arrow at approximately 1 o'clock is the radius up to the middle of the airway smooth muscle layer (r M ). The material composing the airway wall was considered inextensible. Notice the thinning of the airway wall when the lungs are inflating to TLC. It this schematic it was assumed that the luminal geometry at FRC was equal between normal and asthmatic. It was further assumed that the DI was increasing luminal radius by 25% in both normal and asthmatic, so that the luminal geometry at TLC was also equal between normal and asthmatic. The schematic demonstrates that a 25% increase of luminal perimeter (P L ) only causes a 21.2% increase of the perimeter at the middle of the ASM layer (P M ).

One may think that an increase in P L should thicken the airway wall, for the same reasons as it increases the length and the perimeter of the airways. However, the materials constituting the airway wall hardly change in volume during a DI compared to the air-filled compartments (i.e., the lumen of the airways and the alveoli). Increasing the length of an airway and its caliber during a DI to TLC should thus exert a tensile stress on the airway wall, which tends to make it thinner. Many CT studies actually reported that the airway wall is thinner at TLC, supporting that the airway wall is compressed in this dimension during a DI [92, 94] . This was also shown in cat lobes frozen at different volumes [131] , as well as in isolated airways stretched to The letter a represents the airway perimeter and, in this example, is set to 10 mm. The letter b is the airway longitudinal distance covered by the ASM bundle going around the full circumference of the airway. Finally, the letter c represents the length of the ASM bundle and, in this example, is set at an angle 75 deg off the long axis of the airway. Using trigonometry, b and c can be determined. Now imagine that this airway is stretched radially to increase its perimeter by 25%. On the flattened airway shown in (a), this would increase the height of the rectangle by 25% without changing its length (b). Compared to (a), the length of a would increase by 25%, the length of b would remain unchanged and the length of c would increase by 23.5%. The angle of c would also change to 77.9 deg. Therefore, a radial stretch to the airway increasing its perimeter by 25% is expected to strain the ASM bundle by only 23.5%. Now imagine that the airway length is also strained by 25%. On the flattened airway shown in (b), this would increase the length of the rectangle by 25% (c). Compared to (a), the length of a, b, and c would all increase by 25%. In contrast to (b), the angle of c would remain unchanged. Therefore, when both radial and longitudinal strains are applied simultaneously at the same magnitude on an airway, the strain on the ASM is also of this magnitude. elongated lengths [133] . Overall, these suggest that the airway wall is stretched in two dimensions and compressed in one dimension during a DI to TLC. The ASM should thus be longer and wider but thinner at TLC. This is different from stretching an ASM bundle in vitro, where it becomes longer but consequently less wide and less thick. Thus, in contrast to in vivo, the ASM in vitro is stretched in only one dimension and compressed in two directions. The effects of varying the orientation and the direction of strain on ASM contractility have been largely overlooked. Only few studies conducted with isolated cells have examined the effect of strain orientation on ASM contractility [31, [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] .

However, the extent by which the small airways contribute to the overall signal cannot be quantified. FOT was initially suggested by some to distinguish the small from the large airways. The rationale lies in the traveling distances of the oscillations at different frequencies. While oscillations at low frequencies travel far down into the lungs, the traveling distance of high frequencies are shorter. Therefore, while the low frequencies should probe the entire airway tree, the high frequencies should only probe the large airways. By looking at the frequency-dependence of Rrs, or by using a simpler readout such a R 5-19 (which is the subtraction of Rrs at 19 Hz from the Rrs at 5 Hz), it was suggested that the degree of obstruction of the small airways can be deduced. Although this line of reasoning is logical, this is no longer the prevailing belief. First, the penetration depth of the forced oscillations at different frequencies cannot be ascertained. It is thus not sure from how far deep into the lungs the signals used to calculate Rrs at different frequencies emanate. Second, and most importantly, computational models have clearly demonstrated that the frequencydependence of resistance is particularly sensitive to the pattern of constriction in peripheral airways [136] [137] [138] .

The measurement of R L with the interrupted deflation also required a certain amount of air to evacuate the lungs in order to measure the change of P L caused by the interruption.

This is the case for the whole-body plethysmography, the interrupted deflation, and the FOT. To convert resistance into ASM strain, some arithmetics are needed. The calculation is based on Poiseuille's equation. This equation states that within a tube with a perfect cylindrical geometry in which flow is running in a laminar fashion, airway resistance is inversely proportional to the luminal radius at the fourth power. A change in airway resistance at different lung volumes can thus be converted into ASM strain, as the percent change in radius is the same as the percent change in airway perimeter (viz., $ASM length). As aforementioned, the airways also elongate during a DI. According to Poiseuille's equation, resistance to airflow is proportional to the length of the airway. So while the increase in caliber at TLC decreases resistance, the elongation increases resistance. As resistance is related to the radius at the fourth power, the effect of changing caliber largely predominates over the effect of changing the length of the airway.

This model is merely constituted of a single airway with a perfectly cylindrical geometry that runs into a single elastic compartment. The resistance that stems from the viscous flow of air within the airways in a real airway tree, as well as its response to different interventions, thus seem to be predicted quite precisely just by altering the caliber of a single conducting airway in the modeled lungs.

In addition, chokepoints affect the regional transmural pressures, especially during forced maneuvers. While the transmural pressure downstream of the chokepoint increases during expiration (as the luminal pressure increases in the airways and alveoli subtended by the choked airway), it decreases upstream of the chokepoint. The opposite occurs during inspiration. Either way, the transmural pressures are altered. The strain ASM undergoes is thus attended to be affected in these regions. Also, these chokepoints are usually not present at every lung volume. The chokepoint may thus affect resistance at low lung volumes but not at high lung volumes, and thus affect the change measured between two lung volumes.

P L and the lung volume attained at TLC are variable between individuals. These biological factors thus affect ASM strain during a DI and should thus be considered as important confounders.

The sigmoidal curve that describes the relationship between P L and airway caliber is also shifted to the left in asthmatic patients, at least when a bronchodilator (salbutamol) is administered prior to measurements [85] . This suggests that the changes in airway caliber due to breathing maneuvers occur at lower P L in asthma [85] . This may explain why fluctuation of Rrs during tidal breathing is increased in asthma [72] . Interestingly, this increased tidal fluctuation of Rrs also negatively correlates with the bronchodilator effect of DI [72] . This is somewhat logical. By operating at a steeper part of the sigmoidal curve during tidal breathing, less of the total possible strain is available during a DI to TLC. In contrast to asthmatic patients, the lungs of nonasthmatic individuals seem to breath in a range of P L below the one where airway caliber is greatly affected by small changes in P L (based on small tidal fluctuation of Rrs [72] ). However, for the same reason, the total possible strain the airways can undergo is still available and may occur during a DI to TLC.

This tissue is endowed with the ability to quickly adjust the mechanical properties of the airway wall. Greater is its level of activation, stiffer are the airways. In turn, stiffer airways are intuitively expected to expand less in response to a DI. However, this is not always the case. The change in airway caliber caused by a simulated DI is sometimes greater when ASM is activated by methacholine than when it is relaxed by atropine [130] . This is because increasing the level of ASM activation may also cause airway constriction, which affects ASM strain during a DI for at least two reasons. First, it modifies the length of ASM before the DI, which impacts its contractile capacity. More precisely, shortening the length of ASM decreases its contractile capacity [47, 189] . Second, airway constriction also changes the positions over which the airways are operating on the pressure-radius curve [142] . Following airway narrowing, the DI thus takes place on a more compliant part of the pressure-radius curve and thereby increases the strain for any given stress [29] . Therefore, while the maximal distention attained by the airway during a DI is certainly limited by the level of ASM activation, the strain excursion may not. These have important implications for in vitro studies that attempt to emulate in vivo situations. For example, it may be appropriate to impose an equivalent level of strain on ASM during a simulated DI with or without spasmogeninduced contraction.

On one hand, many methods used to estimate ASM strain during a DI intentionally manipulate the level of ASM activation with bronchoactive substances (bronchoconstrictor such as methacholine or bronchodilator such as salbutamol). Some studies are actually designed to dissociate the active contribution of ASM in determining airway wall stiffness from the passive structural components of the airway wall [58, 75, 166, 191] . These studies investigated the response to DIs before and after the activation or the inhibition of ASM. On the other hand, many methods used to estimate ASM strain during a DI unintentionally manipulate the level of ASM activation by utilizing topical or systemic anesthesia. This is the case for aOCT [85] . For these reasons, the level of ASM activation should sometimes be considered a procedural confounder. Some patients also take medications with either short or long duration of action.

The change in airway caliber though from 0 to 30 cmH 2 O was identical pre-versus postbronchial thermoplasty. Based on these observations, geometrical considerations need to be taken into account to understand the impact of bronchial thermoplasty on ASM strain. Airway caliber changes proportionately to the square of airway perimeter (viz., $ASM length). The same change in caliber induced by rising the pressure from 0 to 30 cmH 2 O in an airway starting at a larger caliber implies that ASM strain was attenuated postbronchial thermoplasty.

This transient stretch is important to quantify as it was proposed to contribute to the beneficial effect of DI by decreasing the contractile capacity of ASM.

A variable range of strains at different frequencies and for different durations in a variety of ASM preparations have been tested. We came to learn that the dynamic environment in which ASM operates in vivo has the potential to greatly affect its contractile capacity. In general, the in vitro results indicate that the decline in contractile capacity is largely dictated by the amount of strain [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] 17, 23, [28] [29] [30] , which is consistent with in vivo results in rabbits [24] and humans [3, 5, 86, 139, 193, 194] , as well as with isolated cells [107] . Together, these studies support the hypothesis that the beneficial effect of DI on respiratory mechanics is related to the decrease in the contractility of ASM elicited by the stretch.
