Our examination of OspC sequences deposited in GenBank confirms and extends the observation of Mathiesen et al. [19] that this epitope has little polymorphism. In particular, the PKKP-COOH motif is invariant in 96% of isolates (127 of 132) of B. burgdorferi sensu lato of medical importance for which the full C-terminal sequence has been reported.

The choice of whether to use rVlsE1 or C6 peptide in an IgG kinetic assay is not clear-cut on the grounds of performance alone. There is some evidence that rVlsE1 is more sensitive than C6 for detecting antibody in the serum of patients with neurologic disease, but this observation must be verified with a larger number of samples and in prospective studies. The C6 assay offers the advantages that peptides commonly have over proteins expressed in E. coli, namely, comparative ease of synthesis of a product of high purity (and presumably lower cost) and high assay signal-to-noise ratio.
