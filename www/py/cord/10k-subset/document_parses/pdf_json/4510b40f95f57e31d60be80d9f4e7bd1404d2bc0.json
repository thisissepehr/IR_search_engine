In this study, we try to detect the cost of a possible influenza pandemic under different scenarios and attack rates. We include the vaccination and antiviral treatment cost for direct cost and we add the work absenteeism cost to the calculations for indirect cost of influenza pandemics. As a case study, we calculate the economic impact of pandemic influenza for Turkey under three different scenarios and three different attack rates.

Direct healthcare costs include vaccination cost, antiviral treatment cost and hospitalization cost. Due to the characteristic symptoms of pandemic influenza, patients may need several days of bed rest at home or may require intensive care unit (ICU) care and non-ICU care at hospitals.
