An infectious etiology of the colitis was carefully excluded. High-dose treatment with methylprednisolone was required to induce remission.

            "text": "There is increasing evidence that immunoregulatory abnormalities play a central role in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory bowel diseases, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease [12] . It has been suggested that a hyperreactivity and increased activation of intestinal T cells are important factors contributing to the engoing mucosal inflammation in these diseases [12, 13] . A recent case report of a patient with severe Crohn's disease who became infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) later in the course of his disease could indicate a role of CD4 \u00f7 T cells in the disease progression. With the loss of CD4 \u00f7 cells and the development of a manifest immunodeficiency, the patient went into stable remission of the intestinal disease [5] . Thus, patients with inflammatory bowel disease may benefit from immunosuppressive treatment such as cyclosporin A (CsA) which preferentially inhibits T cell function. This drug is widely used in organ transplantation, and initial studies Abbrev&tions: CsA = cyclosporin A; HIV = human immunodeficiency virus; IgM = immunoglobulin M; RIA = radioimmunoassay suggested a beneficial effect when given to patients with certain diseases of autoimmune origin. CsA has also been used in the treatment of severe Crohn's disease, but with variable success [1, 2, [7] [8] [9] 11] . Recently, Lichtiger and Present [6] reported favourable results for CsA in the treatment of refractory ulcerative colitis. We report on a patient who developed ulcerative colitis after 6 years of CsA treatment.",

Since the patient's abdominal symptoms did not improve and endoscopy showed worsening of the distal colitis, hydrocortisone enemas were given 2 weeks later. However, no clinical improvement was apparent, and the endoscopic appearance still persisted. Therefore, 6-methylprednisolone was given orally at an initial dose of 48 mg per day and tapered over a 6-week period to a maintenance dose of 8 mg daily in addition to i g sulfasalzine 3 times daily. Under this treatment, the patient's symptoms resolved quickly. Repeat sigmoidal and rectal biopsy specimen showed a marked regression of the previous chronic inflammatory infiltrates. Oral medication with 8 mg 6-methylprednisolone and 3 g sulfasalazine was continued, and the patient showed no symptoms for about 1 year. Then he again observed rectal bleeding. Colonoscopy revealed friable mucosa with a granular appearance and punctate mucosal hemorrhage from the rectum up to the descending colon. Hydrocortisone enemas were given, but the symptoms only resolved when mesalazine enemas were introduced. After 3 weeks of topical treatment, 500 mg mesalazine 3 times per day were given instead of sulfasalazine. The remission is stable now for 3 months (March 1992), and oral 6-methylprednisolone has been reduced to 8 mg every other day.

However, the C. trachomatisspecific proliferation of spleen and mesenteric lymph node lymphocytes was not inhibited [15] . These results indicate that during CsA administration, antigen-reactive lymphocyte populations stimulated in the mucosal environment may expand in tissue sites, even when the antibody and peripheral cellular immune responses are inhibited [14] . This may be of importance for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases with CsA: While the systemic immune responses are suppressed by CsA, the imbalanced immune reaction at the level of the mucosa may still persist. The clinical finding of an early flare-up soon after or still under the influence of CsA is consistent with this hypothesis.",

It is an indication that CsA cannot prevent the initial event leading to the chronic intestinal inflammation seen in ulcerative colitis. Interestingly, only high-dose treatment with methylprednisolone was able to induce remission in our patient. Final conclusions on the role of CsA in the treatment of ulcerative colitis cannot be drawn from our observation. It may, however, serve as a note of caution for the introduction of this agent in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.",
