MLL-PTD leads to a disturbed histone acetylation and upregulation of determined HOX genes. MLL-PTD AML defines a specific AML entity, distinguishable from cases of AML with MLL rearrangement, with a characteristic pattern of co-mutations, including a high association with FLT3-ITD (Q-Y Sun et al., Leukemia 2017) . Prognosis of MLL-PTD-AML is remarkably poor, with initial chemoresistance and high relapse rate; as a consequence, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) in early phase is recommended to overcome its high-risk prognostic impact (JP Patel et al., NEJM 2012; V Grossmann et al, Blood 2012) .

Background: Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) is a rare genetic immune disorder that leaves patients susceptible to life-threatening infections, chronic inflammation and often long hospital stays. X-linked CGD (X-CGD) is caused by mutations in CYBB encoding the gp91phox subunit of the phagocyte NADPH-oxidase, which regulates cell pH and ionic content for efficient microbial killing. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) has been a potentially curative approach for X-CGD patients, but is often complicated by lack of HLA-matched donors and risks of graft versus host disease, graft rejection, and procedure-related fatality. Previous attempts at autologous ex vivo gene therapy for X-CGD using gammaretroviral vectors have met with limited efficacy due to transient engraftment of gene corrected cells, gene silencing, and mutagenic activation leading to myelodysplasia. Here we report on 9 patients with a history of severe X-CGD-related complications, who received autologous ex vivo gene therapy (GT) using a novel self-inactivating lentiviral vector (G1XCGD LV) designed to limit the risk of mutagenesis through preferential expression of the missing g91phox subunit in mature myeloid cells.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CHU Limoges, Limoges, France"}, {"text": "Methods: Similar trials of GT with G1XCGD LV were initiated in the UK (n=3, plus 1 compassionate use patient) and in the USA (n=5, 3 sites).

Two studies showed that treatment of SR acute GVHD with \u03b1AT is feasible and effective. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a series of patients who received exogenous \u03b1AT for SR acute gastrointestinal GVHD or overlap GVHD with acute gut features.

Highest cGVHD was seen in the OTHERS group with 40.8%(29.6-51.8). Highest GRFS was found in the TREO group with 30%(18.5-41.4). Multivariate analysis showed that compared to FLAMSA-CYTBI there was no significant difference in LFS, OS, GRFS, cGvHD or extensive cGVHDfor any of the other treatment groups. However, the BUCY and MEL groups were associated with reduced RI with a hazard ratio (HR) and 95%CI of 0.79(0.64-0.98), p=.03, and 0.60(0.41-0.87), p=.007, respectively. In addition, the CLOFA and MEL groups were associated with increased NRM with a HR of 1.49(1.03-2.15), p=.03 and 1.60(1.06-2.42), p=.025, respectively. Acute GvHD II-IV and aGvHD III-IV were both higher in the MEL group with HR of 1.56 (1.06-2.29), p=.023 and 2.12 (1.36-3.3), p< 10e-3, respectively.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the BeEAM in comparison with BEAM regimen, in terms of overall survival (OS), lymphoma-free survival (LFS), relapse incidence (CIR) and non-relapse mortality (NRM), in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Methods: 131 patients with DLBCL from LYSA centers were matched to 230 patients from the EBMT database. Inclusion criteria were adult patients with DLBCL, who received 1 st ASCT between 2012 and 2016 after BeEAM or BEAM conditioning. Matched criteria were age at transplant, gender, stage at diagnosis, number of prior lines of chemotherapy, disease status at transplant and year of transplant. Hazard ratios for OS and LFS were estimated using Cox regression models stratified on the matched sets, to account for the matched-cohort design.

Emapalumab (NI-0501) is a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes IFN-\u03b3 and is developed as a treatment for HLH.Methods: This open-label phase 2/3 study (NCT01818492, data cut-off is July 20 2017) includes 34 patients \u226418 years old with pHLH based on genetic confirmation, family history, or presence of \u22655/8 HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria. Patients were treatment-na\u00efve (7) or had failed previous conventional HLH therapies (27) . Emapalumab (1 mg/kg intravenously every 3-4 days, increased up to 10 mg/kg based on clinical and laboratory response parameters) was administered with dexamethasone (5-10 mg/m 2 /day with tapering permitted). Treatment duration was 8 weeks with possible shortening to a minimum of 4 weeks or extension up to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The primary endpoint, Overall Response Rate (ORR), was objectively assessed based on normalization or \u226550% improvement in pre-defined criteria: fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias, hyperferritinemia, fibrinogen and/or D-Dimer levels, central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities, with no sustained worsening of sCD25 levels. An exact binomial test at one-sided 0.025 significance level was used to evaluate the null hypothesis that ORR be at most 40%. Following completion of the study, patients entered an extension phase (NCT02069899).Results: Patients (median age 1.0 yr, range 0.1-13 yr) entered the study with broad spectrum of pHLH clinical abnormalities, >30% with CNS involvement. Mutations in pHLH-associated genes were present in 79% of patients. ORR was significantly higher than the pre-specified null hypothesis, thus meeting the primary efficacy endpoint (Table) . Response rates based on Investigator's clinical judgement were 70.6% and 70.4% in the two groups.Emapalumab was safe and well tolerated. Mild to moderate infusion-related reactions occurred in 27% of patients. Infection caused by pathogens potentially favored by IFN-\u03b3 neutralization occurred in 1 patient (disseminated histoplasmosis, resolved with treatment). No off-target effects were observed. Most patients proceeded to HSCT (50% of patients received myeloablative conditioning and 50% reduced intensity conditioning) with favorable outcome (engraftment in 86% and 89% of patients, respectively) and 90% of patients receiving HSCT were alive at 1 year post transplant.Background: ASP0113 is a first-in-class, DNA-based vaccine designed for the prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection; it contains two plasmids encoding glycoprotein B (gB) and phosphoprotein 65 (pp65). This study aimed to investigate the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of ASP0113 compared with placebo in allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT) recipients.Methods: This was a randomised, double-blind, placebocontrolled phase 3 study. CMV-seropositive allo-HCT recipients received five intramuscular 1 ml doses of 5 mg/ ml ASP0113 or placebo (phosphate buffered saline) in a 1:1 ratio on Days \u221214 to \u22123, 14 to 40, 60\u00b15, 90\u00b110 and 180 \u00b110, relative to the day of transplant (Day 0). Plasma CMV viral load was determined through 1 year and analysed at the central laboratory. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were recorded through 30 days after the last randomized treatment injection. Immunogenicity was measured by T-cell responses to pp65 and gB-specific antibody levels through 1 year after the first randomized treatment injection. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a composite of all-cause mortality and adjudicated CMV end-organ disease (EOD) through 1 year post transplant. Secondary endpoints were CMV viraemia rate, adjudicated CMV-specific antiviral therapy (AVT) rate, a composite of protocol-defined CMV viraemia and adjudicated CMV-specific AVT use, first occurrence of Background: Haploidentical stem cell transplantation (Haplo-SCT) with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy) represents a potential curative strategy for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) when a matched related or unrelated donor is not available 1 . While bone marrow (BM) was originally the preferred stem cell source, more recently peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) is more often used. Some retrospective studies suggest that the risk to develop acute and chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) is higher with PBSC than BM, while PBSC may reduce the risk of relapse 2 . Here we analyzed the effect of stem cell source in 91 HL patients receiving Haplo-SCT with PT-Cy, with the aim to evaluate if the final outcome is modified by the use of PBSC or BM.Methods: From April 2009 to January 2017, 91 consecutive patients with poor prognosis HL received a Haplo-SCT with PT-Cy either from a PBSC (n=38) or BM (n=53). The two cohorts were similar for most characteristics, but the PBSC group had more patients with an unfavorable hematopoietic stem cell transplant comorbidity index (HCT-CI) score \u22653 (p=0.002) and had received a non myeloablative conditioning (NMAC; p=0.001).Results: Cumulative incidence of neutrophil>500/ul at day +30 and of platelet >20000/ul at day +60 were 96% (95% CI: 89-98) and 96% (95% CI: 88-99), respectively, with no significant differences between the PBSC and BM cohorts. With a median follow-up of 22.8 months, there was no difference between PBSC and BM graft in terms of cumulative incidence of grade 2-4 acute GVHD (29% vs 21%, p=0.3), grade 3-4 acute GVHD (3% vs 4%, p=0.7) and moderate-severe chronic GVHD (9% vs 7%, p=0.7). This was also confirmed by multivariate analysis. In the whole population, the 2-year overall survival (OS), 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) and 1-year GVHD/relapse free survival (GRFS) rates were 67%, 58% and 58%, respectively. We observed a trend for improved OS (74% vs 62%, p= 0.07) and PFS (62% vs 56%, p= 0.1) for recipients of PBSC relative to BM cells, but pre-transplant disease status was the only significant variable by univariate analysis (Table I) . By multivariate analysis, pre-transplant active disease status, transplant from a BM and HCT-CI \u2265 3 remained the only independent predictors of adverse outcome in terms of OS; PFS and GRFS (Table I) . Nonrelapse mortality was not affected by graft source both by univariate and multivariate analysis, while pre-transplant disease status was the only variable affecting the chance of disease relapse.Conclusions: Overall these data suggest that PBSC is associated with better outcome, in terms of OS, PFS and GRFS, relative to BM cells as graft source for patients undergoing Haplo-SCT with PT-Cy. In addition, the risk of acute and chronic GVHD is not increased after PBSC relative to BM graft.References Disclosure: The authors have no conflict of interests to disclose O139 Consensus CRS and neurotoxicity regrading of \"Juliet\": Phase II prospective study of tisagenlecleucel therapy in patients with relapsed/ refractory large B cell lymphoma Background: T-cell depletion using ex vivo CD34+ cell selection reduces GvHD risk after allogeneic HCT, but delayed immune reconstitution, particularly T-cell reconstitution, has limited improvement in survival. Sex steroids negatively impact lymphopoiesis, likely by thymic atrophy, and our preclinical models have shown that androgen blockade with the GnRH agonist leuprolide enhances thymopoiesis (Goldberg, JI 2009; Velardi, JEM 2014) . We hypothesized that peri-HCT leuprolide could improve immune reconstitution among recipients of CD34selected HCT.Methods: This was a phase II clinical trial of leuprolide in CD34-selected myeloablative allogeneic PBSCT for hematologic malignancies in patients aged 18-60 (NCT01746849). All participants received conditioning with TBI 1375cGy, thiotepa 10mg/kg, and cyclophosphamide 120mg/kg; antirejection prophylaxis with rabbit ATG 5-7.5mg/kg; and palifermin 60mg/kg/d on days -13 to -11 and 0 to +2. Patients received a 3-month depot of leuprolide 11.25mg 2-6 weeks before conditioning and a second depot 3 months later. Primary endpoint was an absolute CD4+ count >=200 by 6 months post-HCT. Patients who died, relapsed, or otherwise did not have flow data available at day +180 were excluded from primary endpoint analysis but included in outcome analyses. We excluded flow data after secondary cell infusions (DLI, CTLs, second HCT, CD34+ cell boost) but followed recipients of these interventions for survival analysis. Descriptive statistics summarized absolute levels of lymphocyte subset counts at select time intervals. A Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test compared counts among patients who received leuprolide/palifermin, historical controls who received palifermin alone, and historical controls who received neither. Kaplan-Meier functions estimated OS/ RFS. Cumulative incidence functions estimated GvHD/ NRM.Results: Thirty-two patients received at least one dose of leuprolide. Median age was 39 years (range 21-57). Twenty-six(82%) had acute leukemia, 3(9%) MDS/MPN, and 3(9%) CML. All but one had an 8/8-matched donor. At median follow-up of 24 months among survivors (range 7-61), estimated 2Y OS was 74%(95%CI 60-91%) and RFS 62%(95%CI 46-83%). CI of TRM at 2Y was 10%(95%CI 2-24%). CI of grade III-IV acute GvHD was 3%(95%CI 0.2-14%). Of 27 patients with evaluable flow data, 30% achieved a CD4+ count >=200 by 180+/-30 days, not significantly different from historical controls. Median lymphocyte counts at 180+/-30 days did not differ significantly among groups (Table; Figure) .Conclusions: This phase II study did not demonstrate significant quantitative improvement in immune reconstitution after leuprolide with palifermin in recipients of TBIbased CD34-selected HCT. TCR sequencing to identify possible improvement in T-cell diversity in this cohort is forthcoming. One potential explanation for these results lies in the initial surge in sex steroid levels immediately after Background: The prospective, multinational, noninterventional EMMOS study aimed to document, and describe real-world treatment regimens and disease progression in patients with MM at different stages of the disease.Methods: Adult patients initiating any new MM therapy between 2010 and 2012 were eligible. A multi-staged patient/site recruitment model was applied to minimize selection bias, and enrolment was stratified by country, region, and practice type. Patients' medical/disease features, treatment history and remission status were recorded at baseline, and prospective data on treatment, efficacy and safety were collected electronically every 3 months until 2 years after last enrolment. Responses were investigatorassessed. Overall findings from EMMOS were previously reported. Here, we are presenting additional analyses focusing on the induction regimens used in the subgroup of patients who proceeded to auto-SCT frontline.Results: A total of 2358 patients (775 with stem-cell transplant [SCT] and 1583 without) were enrolled. Patient demographics/baseline characteristics were as expected. Of 380 recipients of SCT after enrolment, 299 (79%) underwent auto-SCT frontline. 90% of the auto-SCT patients were aged \u226465 years. Among these 299 frontline auto-SCT patients, the majority had a single transplant (87%). The most frequent induction regimen was bortezomibthalidomide-dexamethasone (VTD; n=95; 32%), bortezomib-dexamethasone (VD; n=56; 19%), bortezomib-cyclophosphamide-dexamethasone (VCD; n=49; 16%), doxorubicin-bortezomib-dexamethasone (PAD; n=26; 9%), and cyclophosphamidedexamethasone-thalidomide (CTD; n=26; 9%). Only 1% of patients received a bortezomib-lenalidomidedexamethasone (VRD) induction regimen, while lenalidomide was shown to be the most frequently used agent in lines 2 and 3 at time of relapse. In the VTD subgroup, most patients received 100 mg thalidomide dose during induction. The majority of administration schedule was based on 21 days cycles, while a few other schedules were seen corresponding to 35 days cycles or to delay due to adverse events or other specific reasons. The most prevalent number of VTD cycles was 3 and 4 (42% and 38%, respectively). Lower or higher number of cycles was only marginal (6% and 14%, respectively). Out of the 95 patients with VTD induction, 39% achieved CR as best response, 28% nCR or VGPR and 16% PR. After auto-SCT, the best overall response rates (ORR) at any time during frontline therapy were >85% for those patients whose treatment included 24 University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany Background: We explored the effect of dinutuximab beta (ch14.18/CHO) on outcome within the HR-NBL1/SIOPEN trial population by comparing an era prior immunotherapy availability.Methods: The analysis cohort consists of the immunotherapy population (IP) (2009-2013) and a matched control population (CP) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) . All patients had rapid COJEC induction, up to two TVD courses and high-dose chemotherapy (BuMel or CEM) followed by autologous stem cell reinfusion (HDC/ASCR) within 9 months since diagnosis; local control included surgery and local radiotherapy (21Gy) followed by maintenance with six cycles of isotretinoin. IP patients had additional five cycles of dinutuximab beta short-term infusions with or without subcutaneous interleukin-2. CP patients had to be part of the HDC randomization. The median time between ASCR and initiation of immunotherapy was 109 days in the IP. Only patients without progressive disease at this landmark time point were included in the CP. Median follow-up was 5.8 years (IQR: 4.2 to 8.2 years) for 844 eligible patients.Results: The 5y-EFS of the IP (378 patients) was 57% \u00b13% compared to 42%\u00b12% for the CP (466 patients; p< 0.001). Both populations were balanced for sex, age, stage 4, MYCN amplification and response prior HDC. Multivariate analysis showed an independent higher risk for the CP (p=0.0002, HR 1.573), for CEM (p=0.0029; HR 1.431), a response < CR prior to maintenance therapy (p=0.0043, HR 1.494) and for >1 metastatic compartment at diagnosis (p< 0.001, HR 2.665). After adjustment for risk factors, the benefit of immunotherapy was confirmed in BuMel-(p=0.0066; HR 1.439) and in CEM-treated patients (p=0.0107; HR 2.334).Conclusions: Results suggest a patient benefit from dinutuximab beta based immunotherapy with or without IL2 within the HR-NBL1 trial.Clinical Trial Registry: The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT01704716) and EudraCT (number 2006-001489-17) . https://www.siopen-r-net.org Disclosure: The academic data supported APEIRON to obtain the dinutuximab beta product licensure in May 2017 in the European Union (EMA). SIOPEN and CCRI had an agreement in place with APEIRON regarding the provision of academic data. Ruth Ladenstein and Holger Lode acted as consultants for APEIRON on behalf of SIOPEN for the ch14.18/CHO development.The other authors declared no conflicts of interest. 19 out of 24 (79%) received serotherapy with Alemtuzumab (n=12) or ATG (n=6) before viral reactivation. Where possible immunosuppression was withdrawn in combination to BCV therapy. Viral load was detected in blood by PCR as copies/ml. Data on response to BCV was divided into complete response (CR) with undetectable virus in blood and resolution of symptoms, partial response (PR) with at least 1 log drop in viral load after BCV, no response (NR) with no change in the viral load and stationary disease and progressive disease (PD) with evidence of at least a log rise in viral load by PCR or organ disease progression.Results: The median viral load at the start of BCV was 5.4 million copies/ml (range: 4142-85 million copies/ml). BCV was used as a first line treatment in 8 cases and as second line in 16 cases after failure of first line therapy (n=8), toxicity (n=5) or both(n=3).13/24 (54%) patients had evidence of viral induced organ disease at time of BCV administration; 11 AdV disease (encephalitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis and colitis), 1 Ganciclovir resistant CMV retinitis and 1 BK haemorrhagic cystitis. 19/24 (79%) patients achieved either a CR (n=15) or PR (n=4) and 8/13(61%) patients with organ disease achieved a CR.Two patients with AdV disease and PR received donor derived cytotoxic T lymphocytes to achieve CR. At a median follow-up of 20 months (range: 7-53.8), patients who were in CR or PR did not show any evidence of viral reactivation after BCV discontinuation despite no evidence of immune reconstitution (IR). Four patients had evidence of disease progression with significant rise in viral load while on BCV therapy and all 4 died. The patient with Ganciclovir resistant CMV attained CR of CMV retinitis.Among 22 patients with AdV viraemia \u00b1 disease; 18 (81%) achieved either CR (n=14) or PR (n=4). Nine cases had concomitant BK\u00b1 cystitis at the time of BCV therapy and all had NR. Toxicity was observed in 4/24 cases; renal impairment (n=1), transaminitis (n=1) and diarrhoea (n=2). Median CD3, CD4 and CD8 were persistently low both pre-BCV and at the end of treatment; 100 cells/ul vs 290 cells/ul, 40 cells/ul vs 70 cells/ul and 20 cells/ul vs 120 cells/ul; p=0.2, p=0.34, p=0 .5 respectively (Figure 1 ). At last follow-up, 15/24 (63%) were alive. Of these, viral infection related mortality was 4/24 (17%).Conclusions: BCV is an effective and well tolerated treatment in immune compromised patients with AdV infection with a response rate of 80%.[[O163 Image] 1. Background: Although the impact of donor graft composition on clinical outcome after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been studied, little is known about the role of intra-graft \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire on clinical outcome following HSCT. Using high-throughput sequencing we sought to analyze the TCR \u03b3-chain (TRG) repertoire of \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells within donor stem cell grafts and address its potential impact on clinical response in the corresponding patients.Methods: We analyzed twenty peripheral blood stem cell grafts from matched unrelated donors and classified as CMV-positive/negative. The respective acute myeloid leukemia recipients were followed for disease relapse and acute graft-vs-host disease (aGvHD) development post-HSCT. \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells were isolated using magnetic beads and the gDNA extracted for next-generation sequencing (ImmunoSEQ, Adaptive Biotechnologies). TRG characteristics were assessed using VDJTools, VDJviz, tcR and ImmunoSEQ Analyzer platforms.Results: Deep sequencing showed similar median total/ unique reads in all grafts as well as similarly low unique CDR3 TRG ratios. Grafts presented multiple clonal overrepresentations, with no differences on TCR richness between patient groups. Grafts received by the non-Background: Prognosis of mature T-and NK-cell lymphomas remains poor despite development of novel therapeutic agents. Accordingly, these lymphomas are still good candidates of allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) to achieve long-lasting remission of the diseases. However, the analysis of transplantations for these lymphomas is scarce, mainly due to the rarity of these lymphomas. Hence, we analysed the data of these transplantations operated in 15 different Japanese institutions as a multi-institutional joint research and examined factors that affected the outcomes in aims of figuring out better transplant strategies against these lymphomas.Methods: A total of 116 patients who received allo-HSCTs for mature T-and NK-cell lymphomas (PTCL-NOS, n=38; NK/T cell lymphoma nasal type, n=22; AITL, n=20; ALCL, n=12; EATL, n=8; Other lymphomas, n=16) from 1998 to 2016 in 15 institutions were examined. Median age at transplantation was 50 (range, 18-69). Forty patients received transplantation from related bone marrow transplantation (BMT) / peripheral blood stem cell Background: Children, adolescents and young adult patients with ALL with second relapse, relapse after allogeneic SCT or patients with primary refractory disease have a poor prognosis with conventional treatment concepts. In this patient group several studies using second generation CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR-T cells) demonstrated high efficacy with two year survival rates of up to 65%. Recently, two different CAR-T cell products were approved by the FDA and in 2018 also by the EMA in Europe: Tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah\u00ae) for the treatment of patients with B-precursor ALL who are i) refractory, ii) in second relapse or iii) who relapsed after allogeneic SCT (relapsed/refractory ALL; r/r ALL) as well as for diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Axicabtagen Ciloleucel (Yescarta\u00ae) for the treatment of B-cell lymphoma. Here we report our first results using commercially available CAR-T-cell product Tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah\u00ae) in patients with ALL which were treated by the University Hospital for Children and Adolescents Frankfurt am Main (n=9), the Department of Medicine III, University Hospital LMU Munich (n=1), and the von Hauner Kinderspital, LMU Munich, Germany (n=1).Methods: Between October and December 2018 eleven patients received apheresis for CAR-T cell generation. Nine patients suffered from r/r c-ALL, and two from r/r Bprecursor ALL. Eight patients had relapsed after allogeneic HSCT, one patient each suffered from first r/relapse, second r/relapse or from primary r/ALL. In 9/11 (82%) patients CAR-T cell production was successful after one and in 2 patients (18%) after a second apheresis.Median patients' age was 16.7 years (1.1-25.4 ). Between apheresis and start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy (LDC), 10/11 patients received low dose chemotherapy according to the FRAPOSTALL protocol (Willasch et al. 2016 ) and one patient was treated with inotuzumab. Production slots were immediately available, resulting in turn-around-time from apheresis to product delivery of 3-4 weeks. Disease status at start of LDC was CR w/o MRD (n=4), CR MRD pos. (n=2), CRi (n=1), persistence of blasts (n=2), and disease progression (80-100% blasts, n=2). LDC consisting of FLU-CYC was given to 9/10 patients, one patient did not receive LDC.Results: CAR-T cells could be transfused to 10/11 patients at a median dose of 1.5 Mio/kgBW (0.145 Mio 8.5). In one patient, in whom a second viral transduction procedure was necessary; neither LDC nor CAR-T cell transfusion could be given because of diseases progression and deterioration of the patient's general condition. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) grade I was observed in one patient; 8/10 patients did not develop CRS. Cytokine related encephalopathy syndrome (CRES) grade II was observed in 1/10 patients. At day +28 8/10 patients (80%) achieved MRD negative CR.
