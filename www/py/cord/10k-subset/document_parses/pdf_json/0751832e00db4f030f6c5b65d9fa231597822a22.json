            "text": "UV light is a widely-employed, and environmentally-sensitive bactericide but its mechanism of action is not fully defined. Proteins are major chromophores and targets for damage due to their abundance, but the role of proteins in inducing damage to bound DNA, and the effects on DNA-protein interactions is less well characterized. in E. coli (and other Gram-negative bacteria) the cyclic AMp receptor protein (CRP/CAP) regulates more than 500 genes. In this study we show that exposure of isolated dimeric CRP-cAMP to UV modifies specific Met, Trp, Tyr, and Pro side-chains, induces inter-protein Tyr63-Tyr41 cross-links, and decreases DNA binding via oxidation of Met114/Pro110 residues in close proximity at the CRP dimer interface. UV exposure also modifies DNA-bound cAMP-CRP, with this resulting in DNA cleavage at specific G/C residues within the sequence bound to CRP, but not at other G/C sites. Oxidation also increases CRP dissociation from DNA. The modifications at the CRP dimer interface, and the sitespecific DNA strand cleavage are proposed to occur via oxidation of two species Met residues (Met114 and Met189, respectively) to reactive persulfoxides that damage neighbouring amino acids and DNA bases. These data suggest that modification to CRP, and bound DNA, contributes to UV sensitivity.",

CRP regulates more than 500 genes in E. coli by binding to approximately 300 high-affinity sites 1 . CRP also binds to more than 10000 low-affinity sites in the E. coli genome, indicating that CRP is not only a specific transcriptional regulator, but also a chromosome shaping protein 2,3 . CRP binds as a dimer to DNA sites, and subsequently with RNA polymerase to activate transcription. This activity is cAMP dependent, with complexation resulting in a conformational transition that converts apoCRP from a low-to a high-affinity DNA binding protein which binds at specific sequences upstream of the promoter 4 . The structural basis of CRP interactions with cAMP is well understood 5 . CRP is a homo-dimeric protein with each subunit able to bind one cAMP in a large N-terminal domain that is also responsible for subunit-subunit interactions 6,7 . A smaller C-terminal domain contains a helix-turn-helix motif involved in DNA attachment, with binding generating a strong kink in the DNA chain 8 . This CRP-DNA binding domain is highly conserved across many bacterial regulatory proteins 9,10 .",

In the presence of cAMP, and increasing amounts of CRP, a band with lower migration capacity was detected arising from protein binding to the strong symmetric site ( Fig. 1A; lanes 2-4) . Exposure of the cAMP-CRP complex to UV light, before addition to DNA, markedly decreased protein binding to the DNA (Fig. 1A , compare lanes 2-4 with 5-7), consistent with UV damage impairing protein binding capacity. Inclusion of the thiol compound dithiothreitol (DTT; Fig. 1A , compare lanes 5-7 with 8-10) during UV irradiation prevented the inhibition of CRP binding to DNA. In contrast, NaN 3 and mannitol did not prevent the inhibition of CRP binding by UV (Fig. 1A , compare lanes 5-7 with 11-13 and 14-16, respectively).",

UV exposure of the DNA/CRP/cAMP complex resulted in specific strand cleavage ( Fig. 2A , lane 2 and Fig. 2B) , which was not observed when DNA alone was exposed to UV light ( Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and Fig. 2B ). Incubation of DNA/CRP/cAMP complexes in the dark did not induce DNA damage (Fig. 2C, lane 2) . This CRP-and UV-light dependent cleavage occurs at specific G/C base pairs (Fig. 2D) in one of the half-sites, in the position where a strong kink is generated in the DNA structure on binding of CRP/cAMP 17 . Omission of cAMP, or denaturing of either the CRP or DNA before irradiation prevented this DNA damage (data not shown). Inclusion of mannitol and NaN 3 had no effect on the DNA cleavage (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 7) , consistent with a localized and specific oxidation. In the absence of DTT, (usually present in the CRP binding buffer), both cleavage at the specific G/C pair and limited cleavage at other sites was detected (Fig. 2, lane 6) . These data indicate that DNA cleavage occurs via two mechanisms: a highly-specific process in the presence of DTT that involves a cAMP-CRP-derived intermediate that reacts at specific nucleotides, and a less-selective and more limited process in the absence of DTT, that . UV exposure alters the chemical composition of CRP in the absence and presence of DNA. Isolated CRP-cAMP complex (0.2 and 50 \u03bcM, respectively) was incubated in the dark, or exposed to UV light (\u03bb max 310 nm, 30 nm band width, 6 W m \u22122 , normoxia) for 15 min, before analysis using UPLC with pre-column derivatization and fluorescence detection (panels A,B) or LC-MS/MS (panels C-F). Panel A: Changes in amino acid composition determined by acid-hydrolysis and total amino acid analysis. Data are expressed as % modification of the indicated amino acids (positive values indicating loss, negative values indicating formation) relative to the UV exposure control. Mean \u00b1 SD from 3 independent experiments. Panel B: Material balance for Trp and Tyr residues determined by UPLC analysis with direct fluorescence detection on acid-hydrolysed UV-exposed CRP-cAMP complex. Levels of unmodified parent amino acid, formation of DOPA, the total of NFK and Kyn (as NFK is converted to Kyn during acid hydrolysis) and unknown products (difference to control values) are indicated. Mean \u00b1 SD from 3 independent experiments. Panel C: Extent of modification at different amino acids (Met, M; Pro, P; Ser, S; Tyr, Y; His, H; Trp, W) detected by LC-MS/MS for control CRP-cAMP, UV-exposed CRP-cAMP, and preformed CRP-cAMP-DNA complex exposed to UV. Modifications detected at individual sites (panels D-F) were summed and are expressed as a percentage of the total (native and modified) concentration of the amino acid detected. Panels D-F: Percentage extents of modification at individual amino acids in the CRP sequence (indicated on horizontal axis as position number in sequence). Panel D: control CRP-www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ involves diffusible oxidants that can react at multiple sites. Thus, the presence of thiols, as would occur in vivo, limits DNA damage to a highly-specific, UV-driven, process involving cAMP-CRP-derived species.",

This cross-linked peptide showed the expected \u22122.01 Da mass difference compared to the sum of the parent peptides, and a theoretical mass close to the experimental (4255.143 vs 4255.092 Da; error 11.9 ppm).

The distance distribution of the atoms forming this cross-link (Fig. 5C,D) , are consistent with this being inter-protein (i.e. a cross-link between two chains on different dimer molecules), as the average calculated distances between these residues for a putative intra-chain link is 18.7 \u00c5 (shortest 16.5 \u00c5), for an inter-chain link 34.0 \u00c5 (shortest 31.1 \u00c5), values that are much larger than those over which such cross-links are likely to form (cf. data for zero-link chemical cross-linking reagents 19 ).

Panel E: UV exposed CRP-cAMP. Panel F: CRP-cAMP exposed to UV in presence of DNA (as above). Modifications at the indicated residues are given as the change in m/z (\u221222, \u221210, +5, +16, +32, +42, +56) detected by MS for the modifications included in the data searches. The majority of the modifications correspond to m/z + 16 species assigned to the addition of one oxygen atom (formation of an alcohol at Pro and Tyr; generation of the sulfoxide from Met).

The data presented here indicate that isolated cAMP-CRP is sensitive to biologically-relevant UVB and UVA wavelengths (280-360 nm) and doses, with this generating chemical modifications on specific side-chains, and structural Expansions of the dimer-interface region from panels B and C, indicating the Pro110 (yellow)-Met114 (red) pairs on the individual monomers and the increased proximity of these species at the dimer interface in the DNAbound structure (panel E) compared to the non-bound (panel D). Modification at these residues, with conversion of Met114 to the sulfoxide and Pro110 to an alcohol are proposed to result in significant steric and electronic interactions that limit binding of UV-oxidised isolated cAMP-CRP to DNA (cf. Fig. 1A) , and dissociation of cAMP-CRP from DNA when the bound complex is exposed to UV (cf. Fig. 1B) . In panel E, the Trp13 residues (orange) are also indicated as these residues move closer to the Pro110-Met114 residues on DNA binding.

Significant UV-induced modification was detected at Met, Trp, Tyr, Pro, Ser and Arg. MS peptide mass mapping indicate that specific Met, Tyr, and Pro residues are modified, with large differences in parent loss and % conversion to products between sites. The extent of modification at individual Trp sites could not be determined, but the overall extent of Trp oxidation was significant, with a proportion of this being NFK and Kyn, together with other uncharacterized materials. Oxidation at Met yielded the sulfoxide, and Tyr oxidation yielded both DOPA and dityrosine. Unusually, significant modification was also detected at Ser and Pro, with these not being typical UV targets. Some of the Ser loss may arise from their proximity to the bound cAMP 22 . Products from Ser (probably carbonyls) were not detected, as these were not included in the MS modification database. The products from Pro were detected as m/z +16 species, consistent with the formation of alcohols (hydroxyPro 23, 24 ).",

SDS-PAGE data indicates significant levels of non-reducible cross-links, supported by the MS detection of a covalent Tyr63-Tyr41 (dityrosine) link, assigned as an inter-molecular linkage, as the calculated intra-chain and inter-chain distances are too large for such species, unless the protein adopts conformations markedly different to those of free CRP, or DNA-bound CRP. Whether dityrosine is the sole type of cross-link is however unclear. The sequence of these two peptides is indicated, together with the site of the di-Tyr linkage between the two Tyr (Y) residues (vertical green line). A number of the detected fragment ions retain this cross-link confirming its location. Panels C and D: Rendering of the structure of the CRP-cAMP complex (PDB structure: 2wc2) indicating the relative positions of the Tyr41 and Tyr63 residues both within the individual monomer chains, and between Tyr41 when these are present on different monomer chains. The corresponding vectors for intra-chain (\u25aa) and inter-chain (\u25aa) cross-links are indicated. In panel D, these vectors are plotted as distance distributions for a putative intra-chain cross-link (blue bars: average 18.7 \u00c5, 16.5 \u00c5 shortest) and a putative inter-chain cross-link (red bars: average 34.0 \u00c5, shortest 31.1 \u00c5). These high shortest and median distances (>15 \u00c5) imply that the observed cross-links are inter-molecular in nature and occur between monomers in two different dimers. This conclusion is supported by the surface accessibility of the two Tyr residues in both the DNA-free and DNA-bound forms (Supplementary Fig. 3 ).",

However, UV-induced modification of cAMP-CRP had a marked effect on native cAMP-CRP binding to DNA. It is well established 8 that cAMP-CRP binding to DNA is associated with structural changes at the dimer interface, with the monomer units rotating relative to each other (Fig. 4B,C) . Interestingly, two of the most heavily modified residues, Met114 and Pro110, are in close proximity both to each other, and to the respective residues on the other monomer, at this interface (Fig. 4B,C) . The distance between the imine nitrogen on Pro, and the sulfur on Met calculated as 8.9 \u00c5. Conversion of the Met residue to the sulfoxide, or addition of an OH group to the Pro ring, is predicted to provide significant adverse steric and electronic interactions between these sites, thereby preventing the rotation and structural changes required for binding of cAMP-CRP to DNA. These residues are close to Trp13, with the distance between C2 of Trp13 and imine nitrogen of Pro110 ~5.7 \u00c5 in the non-DNA bound structure. This proximity rationalizes the high extent of modification at these residues. Extensive modification was also detected at these residues when the cAMP-CRP complex was bound to DNA before UV exposure. Oxidation at these same Met and Pro residues in the DNA-bound complex, and their resulting unfavourable interactions, may promote dissociation of the dimer from the DNA and rationalize the decreased binding seen in the gel shift assays (cf. Fig. 1A, lanes 4 versus 7) .",

Reaction of these species with a target results in the formation of Met sulfoxide from the persulfoxide, and oxidation of the target.

The detection and quantification of oxidation products was determined on peptides generated by tryptic digestion as described previously [31] [32] [33] . Samples (150 \u00b5g protein) were prepared as described above, then subjected to buffer exchange into 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer (ABC buffer) using spin filters (10 kDa cut-off). Reduction and alkylation was carried out using tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP, 10 mM) and chloroacetamide (40 mM) solution in ABC buffer. Residual materials were removed by centrifugation, and the samples digested overnight at 37 \u00b0C, using trypsin with 0.2% deoxycholic acid. Peptides were then collected by centrifugation and the removed by precipitation using formic acid. Samples were then analyzed on either a Bruker Impact II ESI-QTOF (Bruker Daltonics) or an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). For the former separation was carried out using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 chromatography system (Thermo Fisher) with an Aeris Peptide XB C18 Column (25 cm, 2.6 \u03bcm particle size, 2.1 mm internal diameter). Samples were eluted using a solvent gradient system over 80 min, using acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid and 2.5% dimethyl sulfoxide at a flow rate of 200 \u03bcL min \u22121 . Sampling rate was 2 Hz for MS 4-16 HZ ms2 (IDAS, top20), and a scan range of 150 to 1500 m/z. For the Fusion system, samples were separated on an EASY nLC 100 chromatograph using a flow rate of 250 nL min \u22121 and gradient of solvents A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, TFA) and B (80% acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA). Data acquisition was carried out with a universal method consisting of a full MS Orbitrap scan followed by data-dependent high-energy collisional dissociation MS/MS scans. Data analysis was performed using MaxQuant (version 1.5.3.30) 34,35 with semi-specific tryptic constraints and a 1% peptide level false discovery rate. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was used as a fixed modification. Data was filtered in order to extract peptide-spectrum matches corresponding to established oxidative modifications using a list of known oxidative modifications 36 , with changes at Met, His, Tyr and Pro as variable modifications 29, 31 . The % modification at a particular site was estimated using label-free quantification ratios relative to the parent, as determined using Maxquant. Peaks with changes of >10% were evaluated in respect to elution times, isotopic distribution and MSMS using Skyline (version 4.1) 37 .",
