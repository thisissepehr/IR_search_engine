In an effort to better treat this group of patients, several management strategies have evolved, including aggressive debulking combined with systemic chemotherapy (principally for ovarian cancer), debulking with continuous hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion (CHPP), immunotherapy, and photodynamic therapy (PDT). Introduced clinically in 1985, PDT is an anticancer treatment that combines a photosensitizer drug, oxygen, and laser light to produce cytotoxic reactive oxygen species. 4 -6 Photosensitizing agents are thought to accumulate preferentially in tumor cells, thereby making PDT-induced damage selective for malignant cells. 7, 8 Debulking is an important component of this therapy, because light penetration with currently available sensitizers is limited to \u03fd5 mm.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 125, "end": 128, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 129, "end": 132, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 133, "end": 136, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 800, "end": 804, "text": "4 -6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 951, "end": 953, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 954, "end": 955, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "A phase II trial of surgery and intraoperative PDT for diffuse peritoneal cancers is under investigation at our institution.

Because peritoneal-based seeding of malignant disease is often difficult to diagnose by noninvasive means, the ultimate determination of the ability to debulk all tumor nodules to \u03fd5 mm thickness was made during surgery by visual inspection of all peritoneal surfaces.

The linear trend test was used to test for increasing or decreasing complication rates by increasing levels of an ordinal factor.

Because we investigated several surgery-related factors that were strongly associated with both the outcomes and with each other, forward and backward strategies enabled us to avoid redundancy in constructing models of significant independent predictors of postsurgical complications. A likelihood ratio test was used to either select or eliminate factors. Candidate factors included age, sex, diagnosis, prior operations, body mass index, number of organs resected, number of nodules removed, surgery duration, and estimated blood loss. Number of nodules removed, surgery duration, and estimated blood loss were evaluated as both continuous and categorical factors because each was significant in univariate analysis.

In severe cases, it can progress to ARDS, shock, and multiorgan failure. Although a consensus has not emerged to explain the sequence of events at the molecular and cellular levels, SIRS is believed to occur when proinflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u2423, interleukin-1, and interleukin-8, stimulate an exaggerated response from immune effector cells, such as neutrophils, dendritic cells, and macrophages. 20, 21 Ongoing proinflammatory cytokine production from these effector cells then presumably leads to propagation and amplification of this inflammatory cascade, with resultant end-organ manifestations. 18, 22 Ischemia/reperfusion and host-cell apoptosis, particularly of lymphocytes and intestinal epithelial cells, are considered important mediators of the SIRS pathway because the release of oxidants and cellular degradative enzymes likely contributes to end-organ injury. 23, 24 The variability in the development and expression of SIRS among patients reflects the complexity of the interaction between the various exogenous inflammatory insults that initiate SIRS and the host's response to these stimuli. Our study demonstrates that extensive surgical debulking combined with IP PDT is another clinical scenario in which a pronounced capillary-leak syndrome occurs. The complicated postoperative course observed in this group of patients, exemplified by the massive fluid requirements, the increased need for prolonged mechanical ventilation, and the high incidence of pulmonary complications, is rarely observed after major abdominal surgery alone. In this way, the clinical course of patients after IP PDT resembles that of patients with extensive cutaneous burns, who are susceptible to profound SIRS. This similarity is understandable if the light therapy of PDT is analogous to thermal energy, especially in view of the extensive surface area of the peritoneal cavity. This burn equivalent, in the context of a major abdominal surgical procedure, likely stimulates the production of proinflammatory cytokines that then cause the significant capillary-leak syndrome and the consequent high incidence of postoperative complications observed in these patients. In addition, because the generation of oxygen free radicals and the induction of apoptosis in tumor vasculature are important components of PDTinduced cell killing, 5,6 these same mechanisms may also be active in initiating and promoting the SIRS response after IP PDT.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 177, "end": 180, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 181, "end": 183, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 753, "end": 756, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 757, "end": 759, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 956, "end": 959, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 960, "end": 962, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1230, "end": 1233, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1234, "end": 1236, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "It is difficult to determine whether the capillary-leak syndrome in these patients can be attributed solely to PDT.

[25] [26] [27] Patients treated with CHPP, which combines aggressive surgical debulking with the regional circulation of chemotherapy for patients with carcinomatosis, may be the most analogous to our study group. Although recent analyses of morbidity and mortality after CHPP have shown a 30-day mortality rate of 1.5% to 6% and an overall morbidity rate of 27% to 35%, there does not seem to be the same tendency for profound SIRS after CHPP as after IP PDT. 28, 29 In a report of 183 patients treated with CHPP, Stephens et al. 29 noted a 9% incidence of National Cancer Institute grade III/IV pulmonary complications and an additional 3% incidence of pleural effusion requiring thoracentesis. In our series, National Cancer Institute grade III/IV pulmonary complications occurred in 26% of patients. ARDS has also been observed after CHPP in the absence of other identifiable precipitating factors, but the incidence of this complication is a rarer event after CHPP than after IP PDT. 30 In addition, although CHPP using an open coliseum technique has been associated with extensive fluid requirements to maintain adequate cardiac function and urine output, this was limited to the intraoperative period only and did not persist into the postoperative period, as with our IP PDT patients. 31 Studies such as these reinforce our conclusion that IP PDT is a necessary component of the capillary-leak syndrome beyond that of extensive abdominal surgery alone.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 506, "end": 508, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 783, "end": 787, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 788, "end": 792, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 793, "end": 797, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1244, "end": 1247, "text": "28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1248, "end": 1250, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1314, "end": 1316, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1772, "end": 1774, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2076, "end": 2078, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In conclusion, IP PDT is associated with a significant postoperative capillary-leak syndrome.
