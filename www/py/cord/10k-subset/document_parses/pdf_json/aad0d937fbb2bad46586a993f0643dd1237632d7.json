Additionally, PC activity decreased in dARDS, whereas that in iARDS was normal or even increased. There were also significant differences in PCT, SP-D, and KL-6 levels between the two groups on the day of ICU admission. These results suggest that each iARDS and dARDS may have its distinct patterns of plasma biomarkers, which could help to differentiate between these ARDS subgroups. Alterations in coagulation and fibrinolytic abnormalities have been observed in animal models of lung injury and in human patients with ARDS or ILD [24] [25] [26] . Chambers reported that uncontrolled activation of the coagulation cascade might contribute to the development of fibrosis in both ARDS and IPF, suggesting that coagulopathy is pivotal as a common pathophysiological factor in these diseases [27] . In our study, increased coagulation (suggested by increased TAT) and suppressed fibrinolysis (suggested by elevated PAI-1 levels) were observed in patients with dARDS but were less prominent in iARDS patients. These results are in line with Gunther et al.'s study that showed enhanced procoagulant and depressed fibrinolytic capacities were greater in patients with ARDS than in those with pneumonia or in healthy controls [28, 29] . In addition, there were significant differences in coagulation inhibition or the levels of natural anticoagulant between dARDS and iARDS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show differences in the coagulation profile between ARDS with and without common risk factors, or ARDS mimics. The pathophysiology accounting for these different coagulopathic patterns has not been identified. One explanation might be that inflammation and coagulopathy Fig. 3 Changes in coagulation biomarkers during days 1-5 in the intensive care unit (ICU) for patients with iARDS, dARDS, or pneumonia.

Data are expressed as the mean, with the 95% confidence interval shown by the error bars are relatively limited to the lung in iARDS, whereas dARDS is a more systemic disease. Although the cause of dARDS is direct lung injury, indicators of systemic involvement, reflected in the APACHE II or SOFA scores, were significantly higher in patients with dARDS compared with those with iARDS. Another possible mechanism might be explained by the different pathological findings of iARDS and dARDS.

In the presence of sepsis or ARDS, anticoagulation pathways, such as the PC system, are impaired because of increased consumption, decreased protein synthesis, extravasation from vessels, and degradation by several proteolytic enzymes. Particularly, extravascular leakage resulting from endothelial damage may be the main mechanism during the acute phase [31, 32] . Decreased PC activity in dARDS patients, therefore, may reflect systemic endothelial dysfunction. In contrast, Bargagli et al. reported that PC activity increased during acute exacerbation of usual IP but was normal in stable usual IP or NSIP [33] . They postulated that increased PC activity was associated with upregulation of the fibrinolytic response to a procoagulant state caused by fibrosis.

First, this was a retrospective, observational study conducted at a single center with a relatively small population. A large validation study is needed to confirm our results. Second, we could not perform serological tests for non-influenza respiratory viruses, such as the respiratory syncytial virus or human metapneumovirus. Although we ruled out the common ARDS risk factors and known causes of interstitial pneumonia (e.g., drugs, environmental agents, CTDs) to diagnose idiopathic ARDS, we could not completely exclude the possibility of viral infections or environmental antigen exposures, which could subside spontaneously. Third, we could perform BAL for only about half of iARDS patients, which may not be generalizable to the whole population. Finally, we did not measure the biomarkers in the BAL fluid. Although systemic markers are easier to obtain and the BAL procedure may not always be possible because of the risk of respiratory and hemodynamic complications, the biomarkers in the BAL fluid would more specifically reflect the regional pathophysiology in the alveoli. Further studies are needed to evaluate the pathogenic processes of these biomarkers from the pulmonary compartment to the circulation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Limitations"}, {"text": "Changes in the biomarkers of coagulopathy and alveolar epithelial injury were observed in both patients with dARDS and with iARDS, but those biomarker profiles were significantly different between the two groups.
