In one example of this approach, electrospun nylon filters were used to collect MLFs from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. The filters were washed to obtain liquid probes, which were then tested for human immunoglobulin A (h-IgA) and fractions of h-IgA specific to ESAT-6 and Psts-1, two antigens secreted by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Probes collected for 10 min contained 100-1500 fg of h-IgA and, in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, a portion of these h-IgA molecules showed specificity to the secreted antigens. Separate MLFs and their dry residues were successfully collected using an electrostatic collector and impactor developed especially for this purpose. Visualization of MLF dry residues by atomic force microscopy made it possible to estimate the lipid content in each MLF and revealed mucin molecules in some MLFs. This exciting new approach will likely make it possible to detect biomarkers in individual MLFs. MLFs emerging from an infection site ('hot' microdroplets) are expected to be enriched with infection biomarkers. This paper discusses possible experimental approaches to detecting biomarkers in single MLFs, as well as certain technological problems that need to be resolved in order to develop new non-invasive diagnostics based on analysing biomarkers in separate MLFs.",

Since the lungs are the major organ affected by air pollution, lung disease diagnostics is especially important, and a variety of physical techniques employing x-rays, ultrasound and NMR-based imaging have been introduced to reveal changes in lung tissue. However, these powerful methods cannot catch the molecular signatures that could reveal disease in its early stages, when no serious physical damage to the lung tissue is yet observable. Molecular diagnostics requires samples of lung tissue, e.g. by percutaneous lung biopsy [5] or probing lung fluid obtained in a bronchoalveolar lavage procedure [6] . Both of these procedures are invasive, require certified physicians and cannot be widely used to collect samples to screen large population groups, nor can they be used frequently on the same patient to follow treatment progress.",

This rupture may happen inside the alveoli when closed alveolar sacs are opened upon inhalation, or in the bronchi and bronchioles when liquid plugs break there.

Holmgren et al [15] presented evidence for this by measuring the size distribution of MLFs at different tidal volumes: while the number of MLFs smaller than 100 nm was independent of the tidal volume, the concentration of MLFs larger than 500 nm increased \u223c100-fold with deep breathing. The authors interpreted this observation as the result of two independent mechanisms. One mechanism, independent of the tidal volume, is a closure mechanism operating in the alveoli, while another mechanism involving the closing and opening of terminal bronchioles contributes to the fraction of larger MLFs exhaled with a deeper breath. We may expect that such smaller and larger MLFs, born in different parts of the lungs, will have different compositions and present different sets of biomarkers. Therefore, further studies of the formation mechanisms are needed to answer many practical questions about where the MLFs are born and how representative their composition is of the lung fluid in general.",

We have recently shown that the relative volume of lipids in dry residues is higher in smaller MLFs, which is expected if droplets of different sizes are coated with a surfactant layer of uniform thickness [23] . Both lipids and surfactant proteins are capable of concentrating certain substances either directly, by binding them, or indirectly, by providing a hydrophobic environment where hydrophobic substances accumulate. It is expected that the relative content of such hydrophobic substances with a high partition coefficient will be shifted higher in smaller MLFs, which are surfactant-enriched.

Such a notable difference in the ion concentrations may be explained by the ability of the surfactant protein, SP-A, to form ternary complexes with lipids and Ca 2+ [24] , a process that results in the accumulation of Ca 2+ ions within the surfactant shell of the MLFs. This example illustrates that the potential differences in the composition of MLFs and of lung fluid should always be kept in mind.",

Many self-made and commercial devices have been described, and their successful application in diagnostics has been reported [25] . The very high and extremely variable dilution of lung fluid in the EBC samples was noted by many authors as the main limitation of this collection technique [29] . Because of the high dilution, EBC probes need extremely sensitive assay techniques to detect biomarkers or require a substantial pre-concentration of samples [30] after a lengthy collection process [31] . Often, probe samples from many volunteers are combined to increase the concentration of biomarkers [32] .",

In some modifications, an additional buffering elastic bag is added to allow collection of sputum microdroplets generated by coughing ( figure 1(a) ). After collection, the filters are removed from the holder and washed. Because the amount of nylon material in each filter is tiny (\u223c20 \u03bcg), the filter can be completely washed with a small volume (10-100 \u03bcL) of water, resulting in a high concentration of biomarkers for further analysis.

Compared to EBC devices and filters, collection by impaction requires a powerful pump to accelerate the exhaled air. The theory behind this type of collection predicts that the higher the air speed in the jet, the smaller the MLFs that are collected [33, 34] . Typically, at the highest speed, a 50% cut-off is achieved for MLFs 300-400 nm in size [33] . Thus, smaller MLFs will be underrepresented in the collected probes. Despite these limitations, impactors attract much attention because of their simplicity, ability to separate MLFs of different sizes, high collection speed, and high concentration of material washed from the substrate. Impactors have been used to analyse dry residues of MLFs by electron microscopy [10] , to collect phospholipids in exhaled MLFs for analysis by mass spectrometry [35] , and to collect exhaled microbes and viruses as well as their biomarkers [36, 37] . When exhaled air is mixed with air supersaturated with water vapor, the size of the MLFs may be increased upon vapor condensation to allow MLFs as small as 50 nm to be collected by impaction [37] .",

To the best of our knowledge, our recent paper was the first report describing the use of an electrostatic collector to analyse dry residues of MLFs with AFM [23] . The collector allows dry residues to settle on graphite and other conducting substrates with high efficiency because it uses a special electrostatic 'funnel' made of a polymer mesh that directs the charged particles onto a conducting substrate to produce a highly dense deposition suitable for AFM imaging. Dry residues of individual MLFs were imaged to reveal their complex inhomogeneous internal structure and changes in shape when exposed to high humidity and to saturated chloroform vapor. Measuring the lipid volume that had spread around each particle in the chloroform vapor enabled us to prove that MLFs of different sizes are coated with a surfactant layer of similar thickness.",

It employs electrophoretic collection of charged biomarkers in a microfluidic channel formed between two dialysis membranes, one of which bears spots of antibody molecules covalently linked to the membrane surface. Once a biomarker molecule has been brought over the antibody spot by an electric field inside the 2 \u03bcm layer, the biomarker molecule becomes surrounded by highly concentrated antibody molecules. Their concentration within the 2 \u03bcm layer, \u223c1 \u03bcM [48] , is much larger than a typical antibody K d . The law of mass action makes the biomarker molecule bind one or a few antibodies independently of the biomarker concentration. Those few biomarker molecules that are caught on the spots can then be detected with magnetic beads coated with a secondary antibody. This method makes it possible to bypass the limited affinity of receptor molecules and discover just a few hundred protein molecules in a 50-100 \u03bcL probe within 3-5 min [47] .",

First, certain biomarkers from a limited infection zone are diluted with multiple household proteins from MLFs emerging from a 'healthy' lung. Numerous household proteins might interfere with the immunoassay and the assay of DNA biomarkers by PCR analysis. Second, it is impossible to determine in the whole probe what fraction of MLFs (big or small) bears useful biomarkers. Third, it is impossible to attribute a combination of different biomarkers to a certain fraction of MLFs.

MLFs were deposited through a metal grid (150 mesh, for a transmission electron microscope) using the impactor shown in figure 2(a) . The microarray of deposited dry residues is shown in figure 6(a) . After deposition, the CMC substrate was placed into a humid chamber for 1 h to allow protein molecules to link by reacting with NHS esters on the surface. The surface was then blocked in 0.5 M glycine solution, pH\uf0a0=\uf0a09.0.",

Free beads were then carefully washed off the surface, leaving the pattern of bound magnetic beads presented in figure 6(b) . In control experiments, when human IgA was added to the suspension of magnetic beads before it was applied to the microarray, no pattern was observed.

Second, biospecific labels enabling detection of biomarkers with extremely low LOD are needed, such as magnetic beads or Q-dots modified with antibodies. Besides using particles to label the collected biomarkers, these may also be discovered with specific scanning probe techniques: AFM with cantilever tips coated with specific antibodies; tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy [51, 52] ; and scanning tunneling spectroscopy [53] . All these techniques have the ability to detect a limited number of biomarker molecules.",
