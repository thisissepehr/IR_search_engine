In this regard, currently two LRS platforms have demonstrated adequate performance: the Single Molecule Real-Time Sequencing by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and the nanopore sequencing by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Even though these techniques produce lower coverage and are more error prone than short-read sequencing, they continue to be more successful in identifying polycistronic RNAs, transcript isoforms including splice and transcript end variants, as well as transcript overlaps. Recent reports have successfully applied LRS for the investigation of the transcriptome of viruses belonging to various families. These studies have substantially increased the number of previously known viral RNA molecules. In this work, we used the Sequel and MinION technique from PacBio and ONT, respectively, to characterize the lytic transcriptome of the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). In most samples, we analyzed the poly(A) fraction of the transcriptome, but we also performed random oligonucleotide-based sequencing. Besides cDNA sequencing, we also carried out native RNA sequencing. Our investigations identified more than 2,300 previously undetected transcripts, including coding, and non-coding RNAs, multi-splice transcripts, as well as polycistronic and complex transcripts. Furthermore, we found previously unsubstantiated transcriptional start sites, polyadenylation sites, and splice sites. A large number of novel transcriptional overlaps were also detected. Random-primed sequencing revealed that each convergent gene pair produces non-polyadenylated readthrough RNAs overlapping the partner genes. Furthermore, we identified novel replicationassociated transcripts overlapping the HSV-1 replication origins, and novel LAT variants with very long 5' regions, which are co-terminal with the LAT-0.7kb transcript. Overall, our results demonstrated that the HSV-1 transcripts form an extremely complex pattern of overlaps, and that entire viral genome is transcriptionally active.

Its closest relatives are the HSV-2, the Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and the animal pathogen pseudorabies virus (PRV). The most common symptom of HSV-1 infection is cold sores, which can recur from latency causing blisters primarily on the lips. HSV-1 may cause acute encephalitis in immunocompromised patients. The ability of herpesviruses to establish lifelong latency within the host organism significantly contributes to their evolutionary success: according to WHO's estimates, more than 3.7 billion people under the age of 50 are infected with HSV-1 worldwide (Looker et al., 2015) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 707, "end": 728, "text": "(Looker et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "HSV-1 has a 152-kbp linear double-stranded DNA genome that is composed of unique and repeat regions. Both the long (UL) and the short (US) unique regions are flanked by inverted repeats (IRLs and IRSs, respectively) (Macdonald et al., 2012) . The viral genome is transcribed by the host RNA polymerase in a cascade-like manner producing three kinetic classes of transcripts and proteins: immediate-early (IE), early (E), and late (L) (Harkness et al., 2014) . IE genes encode transcription factors required for the expression of E and L genes. E genes mainly code for proteins playing a role in DNA synthesis, whereas L genes specify structural elements of the virus. Earlier studies and in silico annotations have revealed 89 mRNAs, 10 non-coding (nc)RNAs (Raj\u010d\u00e1ni et al., 2004; McGeoch et al., 2006; Macdonald et al., 2012; Lim, 2013; Hu et al., 2016) , and 18 microRNAs (Du et al., 2015) . Our recent study based on PacBio RS II sequencing has identified additional 142 transcripts and transcript isoforms, including ncRNAs. The detection and the kinetic characterization of HSV-1 transcriptome face an important challenge because of the overlapping and polycistronic nature of the viral transcripts. Polycistronic transcription units are different from those of bacterial operons, in that the downstream genes on multigenic transcripts are untranslated because herpesvirus mRNAs use capdependent translation initiation (Merrick, 2004) . The majority of herpesvirus transcripts are organized into tandem gene clusters generating overlapping transcripts with co-terminal TESs. The ul41-44 genomic region of HSV-1 does not follow this rule, since these genes are primarily expressed as monocistronic RNA molecules. Our earlier study has revealed that these genes also produce low-abundance bi-and polycistronic transcripts. Alternatively, many HSV-1 genes, which were believed to be exclusively expressed as parts of multigenic RNAs, have also been shown to specify low-abundance monocistronic transcripts .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 216, "end": 240, "text": "(Macdonald et al., 2012)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 434, "end": 457, "text": "(Harkness et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 757, "end": 779, "text": "(Raj\u010d\u00e1ni et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 780, "end": 801, "text": "McGeoch et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 802, "end": 825, "text": "Macdonald et al., 2012;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 826, "end": 836, "text": "Lim, 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 837, "end": 853, "text": "Hu et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 873, "end": 890, "text": "(Du et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1423, "end": 1438, "text": "(Merrick, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "SRS technologies have become useful tools for the analysis of transcriptomes. However, conventionally applied SRS platforms cannot reliably distinguish between multi-spliced transcript isoforms, and TSS variants, as well as between embedded transcripts and their host RNAs, etc. Additionally, SRS, even if applied in conjunction with auxiliary techniques such as RACE analysis, has limitations in detecting multigenic transcripts, including polycistronic RNAs and complex transcripts (cxRNAs; containing genes standing in opposite orientations). LRS is able to circumvent these problems. Both PacBio and ONT approaches are capable of reading cDNAs generated from full-length transcripts in a single sequencing run and permit mapping of TSSs and TESs with base-pair precision. The most important disadvantage of LRS compared to SRS techniques is lower coverage. In PacBio sequencing, if any errors occur in raw reads, they are easily corrected thanks to the very high consensus accuracy of this technique (Miyamoto et al., 2014) . Thus, it is only a widespread myth that SMRT sequencing is too error prone to be used for precise sequence analysis. The precision of basecalling is substantially lower for ONT platform than that of PacBio, but the former technique is far more cost-effective, and yields both higher throughput and longer reads.

Another drawback of native RNA sequencing is its low throughput compared to cDNA sequencing. The advantage of dRNA-Seq is that it is free of false products which are typically produced by RT, PCR, and cDNA sequencing.

Two novel 5'-UTR length isoforms of the RL2 transcripts are shown, one of which may contain a truncated form of the RL1 ORF. This truncation is caused by a splicing event.
