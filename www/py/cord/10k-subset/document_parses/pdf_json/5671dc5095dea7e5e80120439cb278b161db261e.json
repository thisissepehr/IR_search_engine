They found that a cortisol total/CRP ratio > 3 upon admission may predict the development of HAP in patients with severe TBI [1] . The study is interesting, while we have some concerns about the study design and interpretation of the data.",

Although the relatively small sample size is considered as a reason for negative findings, we believe that stratified analyses are more important for such a study. HAP is a form of nosocomial pneumonia, which is distinct from VAP [3] . In a published guideline from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society, the term HAP denotes an episode of pneumonia not associated with mechanical ventilation [4, 5] . As acknowledged also by the authors, mechanical ventilation promotes a specific histological pattern of pneumonia [1] . Hence, patients with HAP and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) should be categorized into two distinct groups. All cases of recorded HAP were VAP [1] , which means all these patients received mechanical ventilation. Thus, we are eager to know about the patients without HAP. What is the percentage of mechanical ventilation use in these patients?",
