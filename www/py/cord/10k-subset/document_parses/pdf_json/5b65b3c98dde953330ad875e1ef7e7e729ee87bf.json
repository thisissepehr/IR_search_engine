In our study, the prevalence of respiratory illness symptoms among Malaysian hajj pilgrims for the 2013 season was 93.4%, with a subset of 78.2% fulfilling the criteria for ILI. The respiratory illness prevalence was consistent with French pilgrims during the same year (90.7%). 9 The prevalence for the 2013 African hajj pilgrims was slightly lower (77.6%). 16 The results of our study are in parallel with previous studies, 97.0% and 90.0% for the 2009 Saudi Arabia hajj pilgrims and the 2007 Malaysian hajj pilgrims, respectively. 6, 17 In contradiction, the percentage was lower for the US pilgrims in 2009 who suffered from respiratory illness symptoms (41.3%). 18 Crowdedness is a major risk factor for the transmission of respiratory illness. All compulsory rituals of hajj involve crowded places, jam-packed with pilgrims. These conditions contributed to almost one-half of the pilgrims (52.2%) having contact with people suffering from respiratory illness during hajj. They were at a significantly high risk of developing the respiratory illness by three times higher than those who do not have the contact (P value 0.01). Practising contact avoidance during hajj is imperative as it can shorten the duration of respiratory illness. 18 Practicing social distancing and contact avoidance is effective in reducing the transmission of the respiratory symptoms during the 2009 US pilgrims and ILI symptoms in 2014 with the Indian pilgrims. 18, 19 The majority of the respondents was inflicted with respiratory illness after a brief stay at Arafat (81.2%). It may be correlated with the incubation period of the illness and the peak exposure of pilgrims whilst performing the hajj rituals. Other studies estimated approximately one in three pilgrims will experience respiratory symptoms which usually occurred at the end or shortly after performing hajj rituals. 20 Influenza vaccination is one of the recommended vaccines for high risk pilgrims to reduce mortality and morbidity. The vaccine uptake for influenza in our study is lower (65.2%) in contrast to Malaysian pilgrims in 2007 (72.8%) and Saudi Arabian pilgrims in 2009 (94.4%). 6, 17 The percentage of vaccine uptake among the 2013 hajj pilgrims from other countries were as low as 31.8% for French pilgrims and 31.0% for pilgrims from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Australia. 21, 22 Effective influenza vaccine remains debatable and cannot be proven if the study was conducted without virology confirmation. Multiple factors such as mismatch between vaccine strains and circulating strains, inappropriate storage and the handling of the vaccine can reduce its effectiveness or waning of immunity in the population. One study systematically reviewed the available studies assessing the uptake and effectiveness of the influenza vaccine among pilgrims. The effectiveness of the influenza vaccine varied across studies, but was effective against laboratory-confirmed influenza with a P value of <0.001. 23 In our study, the prevalence of ILI was not significantly associated with the status of the vaccination which was similar with pilgrims in Malaysia (2007), France (2006) and Iran (2006). 6, 24, 25 The vaccine was not associated with the reduction and number of acute respiratory symptoms nor any relation to the length of stay for Malaysian hajj pilgrims in 2007. 26 The findings were not in accordance with the French pilgrims in 2013 in which the ILI symptoms were less frequently reported in the vaccinated group (34.1%) than unvaccinated group (61.5%) and was statistically significant (P value 0.009). 21 In another study, they found that the influenza vaccine appeared to provide some protection in 'at risk' hajj pilgrims but not in the 'not at risk' group. 10 The influenza vaccines prevented clinic visits for ILI among Malaysian pilgrims in 2000 and Pakistani pilgrims in 1999. 11, 27 The influenza vaccination is a protective factor for ILI more than for non-ILI, giving 70-77% protection for ILI and just 20% protection against the non-ILI group. 11 One hundred and forty-nine of our respondents adopted good hand hygiene during hajj (31.8%). The results were similar to the French pilgrims in 2012 (46.3%) and the US hujjaj in 2009 (45.5%). 18, 28 However, the adherence of French pilgrims towards hand sanitizer practices in 2009 was higher (77.4%) than in the 2012 hajj season. 29 Effective hand hygiene practice in this study could significantly decrease the risk of respiratory illness by 60% than pilgrims who practiced poor hand hygiene. It was parallel with the US pilgrims in 2009 and the French pilgrims in 2012, as regularly washing hands and the use of hand sanitizers significantly causes less of the ILI symptoms. 18, 28 A systematic review on hand-hygiene interventions, including education and the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers towards respiratory illness indicated that some of the interventions were not efficacious against respiratory illnesses. 30 The consistent application of hand hygiene during critical points in the chain of transmission is likely to play a major role in shaping the relative effectiveness of hand-hygiene interventions in terms of disease outcome.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 417, "end": 418, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 497, "end": 499, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 672, "end": 674, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 675, "end": 677, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 805, "end": 807, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1380, "end": 1382, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1583, "end": 1586, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1587, "end": 1589, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2005, "end": 2007, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2280, "end": 2282, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2283, "end": 2285, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2473, "end": 2476, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2477, "end": 2479, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 3097, "end": 3099, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 3263, "end": 3269, "text": "(2006)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3287, "end": 3289, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 3290, "end": 3293, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3294, "end": 3296, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 3464, "end": 3466, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 3707, "end": 3709, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3865, "end": 3867, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 3988, "end": 3991, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 3992, "end": 3994, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 4159, "end": 4161, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 4354, "end": 4357, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 4358, "end": 4360, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 4493, "end": 4495, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 4840, "end": 4843, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 4844, "end": 4846, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 5084, "end": 5086, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Face masks are able to limit the spread of microorganisms, mainly from the respiratory droplets. However, the CDC in USA found that the intermittent use of surgical-type masks was associated with more than a 2.5-fold greater risk of infection. Disposable face masks should be used once and replaced when they become moist and are to be disposed of properly. Most of the Malaysian pilgrims admitted to wearing face masks during hajj (82.9%). This finding was in accordance with other studies, 72.9% for Malaysian pilgrims in 2007 and 79.6% for French pilgrims in 2009. 8, 29 The percentage was higher if compared with other countries in the 2009 hajj season; Saudi Arabia (56%) and USA (42%). 17, 18 It has been revealed that face masks either offered no significant protection or were associated with a longer duration of sore throat and fever symptoms among hajj pilgrims. 25, 29, 31 A recent study illustrated that many pilgrims at the 2009 hajj may not have worn masks correctly (e.g. mistakenly positioning the top of the mask below the nose). 32 A recent review by Benkouiten et al. 33 in 2014 also mentioned that the effectiveness of the face mask in the prevention of the respiratory symptoms among hajj pilgrims revealed variable results. Regular use of a face mask was the most essential practical protective factor in respiratory illness, using it for more than 8 h led to a substantial decrease in the incidence of ILI among Australian pilgrims in 2011. 34, 35 These masks were potentially effective at preventing respiratory virus acquisition by household contacts of infected people when worn by healthy people. However, the effectiveness depended largely on adherence to mask use. 36 Honey is one of the most promising natural substances that can combat or prevent respiratory illness. 37 Approximately 22.9% of pilgrims consumed honey during hajj. However, there was no other study to compare the prevalence of honey intake among hajj pilgrims except for one study to determine the effectiveness of honey in reducing respiratory symptoms. 38 During the hajj, pilgrims undergo great physical and emotional strain. The experienced hajj veterans or even umrah is an advantage as it can help them to be more physically prepared as well as mentally and spiritually ready. However, every year is different and every person's experience is individually specific but they are able to prepare themselves as much as possible for the hajj challenges.
