            "text": "Alanyl aminopeptidase (AAP) was purified to homogeneity from human seminal plasma. The calculated molecular weight of the purified enzyme was approximately 137,000\u00b15,000 from light scattering, 140,000 (main) and 137,000 (minor) from non-denatured PAGE and 153,000 from SDS-PAGE in the absence or presence of 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME). These findings suggest that the enzyme is monomeric in form in human seminal plasma. The enzyme hydrolyzed several amino acid 4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide (MCA) substrates. The order of K^t/Km values of AAP at optimal pH (pH 7.5) was Ala-> Lys-Ala-^ Met-> Leu-> Phe-> Arg-^ Arg-Arg-> Lys-> Gly-MCAs. AAP was potently inhibited by bestatin, leuhistin, actinonin, amastatin, and 1,10-phenanthroline. These findings suggest that AAP is an aminopeptidase. We determined that the amino acid sequence of the first 22 residues of the enzyme was Ser 1 -Thr-Thr-Pro-Ser 5 -Ala-Ser-Ala-Thr-Thr 10 -Asn-Pro-Ala-Ser-Ala 15 -Thr-Thr-Leu-Asp-Gln 20 -Ser-Lys-. This sequence was completely coincident with that downstream of the transmembrane site of human intestinal alanyl aminopeptidase N (CD13). We also isolated cDNA encoding AAP from human prostate cDNA library, sequenced its structure, and confirmed human seminal plasma AAP to be identical with alanyl aminopeptidase N. We postulated that native human seminal plasma alanyl aminopeptidase is released into the seminal plasma after the specific site is cleaved by elastase or an elastase-like enzyme. The enzyme level in human seminal plasma determined by single radial immunodiffusion was 5.2\u00b13.2mg/100ml (mean\u00b1SD, re=20) in individuals 20-47 years of age. AAP was immunohistochemically stained in the luminal site-cell membrane of epithelial cells in the prostatic gland and ductuli efferentes of the testis.",

Thus, the enzyme releases one amino acid residue from the N-termini of peptides with broad specificity as described (2, 3) . The enzyme hydrolyzed substrates for dipeptidyl peptidase II (Lys-Ala-MCA). However, it did not hydrolyze the substrates Gly-Pro-MCA for dipeptidyl peptidase IV or Pro-Phe-Arg-MCA for kallikrein. These findings suggest that the enzyme does not show substrate specificity for proline at the N-termini of peptides. The two step reaction using Lys-Ala-MCA (Fig. 3 ) seemed to be dependent on its substrate specificity.",

We confirmed that the AAP from human seminal plasma belongs to the aminopeptidase family, but it is not identical with puromycin-sensitive AAP (puromycin-sensitive enkephalin-degrading aminopeptidase) according to the above data and the N-terminal amino acid sequence (29, 30) . We also observed a major and a minor band of the purified AAP on non-denatured PAGE, which were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Fig. 2B) . Both protein bands were also stained with substrates, Ala-and Lys-Ala-MNAs, and the intensity of the activity staining was apparently parallel to that of protein bands stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Fig.  2B) . Moreover, we detected only one amino acid, serine, as the N-terminal amino acid of the enzyme. These findings indicate that the minor band may correspond to the truncated AAP in its C-terminal region. Furthermore, by using a polyclonal antibody, we isolated a cDNA encoding this enzyme, determined its nucleotide sequence, and predicted the amino acid sequence of AAP (data not shown). The sequence was identical to that described by Olsen et al. and Look et al. (13, 16) . Accordingly, judging from the upstream amino acid sequence of the cleavage site (Pro 45 -Val^-Ala 47 ), the enzyme was apparently attacked by elastase or an elastase-like enzyme, then released into seminal plasma from the cell membrane in the human male genital tract tissues (Fig. 4) . DPP IV also penetrates the cell membrane and is released into the seminal plasma after cleavage of the hydrophobic N-terminal transmembrane domain by chymotrypsin-or pepsin-like enzymes (17) . Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the luminal cell membrane of epithelial cells of the prostatic gland and the ductuli efferentes of the testis were potently stained with anti-human seminal plasma AAP rabbit IgG (Fig. 5, A  and B ). From the above data, we determined the enzyme level in human seminal plasma by single radial immunodiffusion using the newly determined extinction coefficient (\u00a3\u00a3Ionm = 2O) (24) . The enzyme level was 5.2\u00b13.2 mg/100 ml (mean \u00b1 SD, n = 20) in normal adults 20-47 years of age. This finding suggested that AAP constitutes 0.5-1.0% of the total protein in human seminal plasma.",

It has been postulated that the enzyme functions in the hydrolytic inactivation of regulatory peptides such as enkephalin that are involved in signal transduction at the cell membrane (31, 32) . Furthermore, it is also indicated that aminopeptidase N is a major receptor for the enteropathogenic coronavirus TGEV (transmissible gastroenteritis virus) and human coronavirus 229E (HCV-229E) (33, 34) . Thus, aminopeptidase N may play important roles in the entry of coronavirus into and its replication inside cells. On the other hand, Agrawal and Vanha-Perttula (10) speculated that possible substrates for aminopeptidases, including AAP, are located on a non-uniform spermatozoan surface. NagDas and Bhattacharyya (35, 36) reported that the AAP activity level in seminal plasma is significantly higher in non-obstructive azoospermic patients and in men who produce poorly-or non-coagulating ejaculates than normal controls. It is likely that there is some relationship between seminal plasma AAP and sterility in men. However, the real physiological function of AAP in seminal plasma remains unknown.",
