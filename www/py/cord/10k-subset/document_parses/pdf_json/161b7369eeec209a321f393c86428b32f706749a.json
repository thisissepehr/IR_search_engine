At this stage, spontaneous survival is poor, less than 25%. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of specific management of patients with HBV-ALI/FH. Recent Findings Acute HBVinfection and acute exacerbations of chronic HBVinfection can cause acute liver injury (ALI) or fulminant hepatitis (FH). Spontaneous survival at this stage is poor. It is urgent to distinguish between these two entities so that antiviral therapy can be initiated rapidly. Although the indications for antiviral therapy are clear for HBV reactivation, there is no true consensus regarding ALI/FH related to acute HBV infection. The global management of HBV-related FH does not differ from that implemented for other causes of FH, i.e. close cardiorespiratory and neurological monitoring, treatment with acetylcysteine, organ support in the event of organ failure (haemodynamic, renal, respiratory) and albumin dialysis. Liver transplantation remains the only alternative when certain criteria for a poor prognosis are met. A recurrence of HBV infection on the graft can be prevented post-transplant by the administration of HBIG and antiviral therapy for HBV, the modalities varying depending on the risk of recurrence.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The epidemiology of HBV hepatitis has changed considerably during the past 10 years because of global vaccine policies, the development of effective antiviral agents against hepatitis B and the serological screening of populations at risk.

Maintenance therapy is then administered in order to target a defined anti-HB level that decreases over time [46] . Several prophylactic regimens, which vary as a function of mode (IV, IM, SC), frequency of administration, dose of anti-HBs and target concentration, have been proposed. A combination of HBIG and antiviral therapy can reduce the cost and constraints of immunoprophylaxis alone and is more effective. Entecavir and tenofovir plus HBIG may be superior to the combination of HBIG and lamivudine [47, 48] . The recurrence of HBV is low in patients transplanted for fulminant hepatitis B and receiving immunoprophylaxis. By contrast, in patients with HBV reactivation, HBV DNA at the time of LT is frequently high and controlling HBV recurrence may be difficult despite adequate immunoprophylaxis against HBV.
