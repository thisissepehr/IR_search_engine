In the present study, we investigated the induction and biological effects of IFN-\u03bb4 in HCV-infected hepatocytes and their association with responsiveness to IFN-\u03b1. We also studied the effects of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment on IFN-\u03bb4 expression and IFN-\u03b1 responsiveness. HCV infection induced IFN-\u03bb4 expression at mRNA and protein levels in primary human hepatocytes (PHHs). In hepatoma cells, IFNL4 gene transfection or recombinant IFN-\u03bb4 protein treatment robustly increased the protein levels of ISG15 and USP18 in an IFNLR1-dependent manner and potently blocked IFN-\u03b1 signalling. The ISG15/USP18-mediated IFN-\u03b1 unresponsiveness was demonstrated by transfection of siRNAs targeting ISG15 and/or USP18. This potent IFN-\u03bb4 effect was related to prolonged ISG expression after IFNL4 gene transfection. DAA treatment of HCV-infected PHHs reduced the expression of IFN-\u03bbs, including IFN-\u03bb4, and restored IFN-\u03b1 responsiveness. These results demonstrate that virus-induced IFN-\u03bb4 potently blocks IFN-\u03b1 signalling by inducing high protein levels of ISG15 and USP18. Moreover, the data clearly demonstrate that DAA therapy restores IFN-\u03b1 responsiveness in HCV-infected cells.",

The majority of patients with HCV infection fail to clear the virus and develop chronic persistent infections 2 . Until recently, the standard treatment for HCV infection was a combination of pegylated interferon-\u03b1 (peg-IFN-\u03b1) and ribavirin. Currently, HCV infection is usually treated with various direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) that target different HCV proteins, and a high rate of sustained virological response (SVR) is achieved with these drugs 3 . Unfortunately, the high cost of DAAs has resulted in limited access in developing countries where the disease burden is relatively high 4 . DAAs can also lead to the emergence of HCV resistance-associated variants (RAVs). DAA failure usually occurs in less than 5% of treated chronic hepatitis C patients, and RAVs are found in most of these cases 5, 6 .",

However, the mechanisms by which the SNPs near the IFNL3 locus influenced treatment outcome were unknown until the IFNL4 gene was identified near the IFNL3 locus in 2013 14 .

As expected, the hepatic levels of ISGs in HCV-infected livers are associated with functional IFN-\u03bb4 expression 18 , and a functionally impaired variant of IFN-\u03bb4 is associated with weaker induction of ISGs in HCV-infected livers 19 .

First, we examined the expression of type I and type III IFNs after HCVcc infection in primary human hepatocytes (PHHs). In line with the previous studies 7-10 , we confirmed the induction of IFN-\u03bbs, rather than IFN-\u03b2 ( Supplementary  Fig. 1 ). Next, using PHHs from four different donors with IFNL4 \u0394G/\u0394G or TT/\u0394G genotypes, we observed that both poly(I:C) transfection (Fig. 1A) and cell culture-derived HCV (HCVcc) infection (Fig. 1B) induced IFN-\u03bb4 mRNA expression, although the mRNA level of IFN-\u03bb4 was much lower than that of IFN-\u03bb1 (Fig. 1A,B) . We also examined time kinetics of IFN-\u03bb4 gene expression after HCVcc infection ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). We confirmed the expression of IFN-\u03bb4 after HCVcc infection at the protein level in PHHs with IFNL4 \u0394G allele (Fig. 1C ,D) whereas PHHs with IFNL4 TT/TT genotype did not produce IFN-\u03bb4 protein after HCVcc infection (Fig. 1D) . Furthermore, we detected IFN-\u03bb4 protein in culture supernatant of PHHs with IFNL4 \u0394G/\u0394G genotype after HCVcc infection (Fig. 1E) . We reported previously that prolonged stimulation with IFN-\u03bb3 blocks the response to exogenous IFN-\u03b1 10 . To investigate whether the endogenous IFN-\u03bb proteins that are produced in response to HCV infection, including the IFN-\u03bb4 protein, also render cells nonresponsive to exogenous IFN-\u03b1, we infected PHHs with HCVcc and examined the response to exogenous IFN-\u03b1. Both STAT1 phosphorylation (Fig. 1F ) and OAS1 upregulation (Fig. 1G ) in response to exogenous IFN-\u03b1 were attenuated in HCV-infected PHHs.",

Moreover, treatment with telaprevir and sofosbuvir restored IFN-\u03b1 responsiveness, as demonstrated by restored STAT1 phosphorylation (Fig. 2B ) and OAS1 upregulation (Fig. 2C ).

            "text": "To examine the effect of IFN-\u03bb4, we first transfected the IFN-\u03bb4-expressing plasmid into Huh-7 hepatoma cells of which IFNL4 genotype is TT/TT. We also transfected the cells with IFN-\u03b2-or IFN-\u03bb1-expressing plasmids for comparative purposes. As results, we detected IFN-\u03bb4 protein in cell lysates after transfection with the IFN-\u03bb4-expressing plasmid (Fig. 3A) . Moreover, we detected IFN-\u03bb4 protein in culture supernatant by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting ( Fig. 3B ) although IFN-\u03bb4 protein is known to be poorly secreted when it is expressed in mammalian cells 14, 20, 21 . Transfection with the IFN-\u03bb4-expressing plasmid induced STAT1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3C ) and ISG expression (Fig. 3D ) in both Huh-7 cells and in PHHs ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Our previous report showed that HCV-infected hepatocytes produce IFN-\u03bbs that increase the protein levels of STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9, and that increased levels of STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9 prolong the upregulation of some ISGs 10 . Transfection with the IFN-\u03bb4-expressing plasmid also caused sustained upregulation of these ISGs, including Mx1, ISG15, OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, and OASL (Fig. 3E ). In fact, the intracellular HCV RNA titre was decreased by transfection with the IFN-\u03bb4-expressing plasmid (Fig. 3F) . Furthermore, we used the IFNL4-TT plasmid, which cannot generate IFN-\u03bb4 protein due to a premature stop codon 14 and found that it did not cause STAT1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3G ) nor did it induce ISG expression (Fig. 3H ). STAT1 phosphorylation and induction of ISG expression were also observed by treatment with recombinant IFN-\u03bb4 protein ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ). Silencing Cells that overexpress IFN-\u03bb4 or treated with IFN-\u03bb4 show weaker responses to IFN-\u03b1 treatment. We reported previously that IFN-\u03bb3-pretreated cells show an attenuated response to exogenous IFN-\u03b1 treatment, as evidenced by reduced STAT1 phosphorylation and ISG expression compared to non-pretreated cells 10 . Similarly, IFN-\u03bb4-transfected cells also showed weaker STAT1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A ), weaker STAT2 phosphorylation ( Supplementary Fig. 6A ) and lower ISG expression (Fig. 4B ) in response to exogenous IFN-\u03b1 treatment compared to mock-transfected control cells. However, this unresponsiveness was shown only in response to IFN-\u03b1 treatment, not to IFN-\u03b2 or -\u03bb treatment (Fig. 4A ). IFN-\u03bb4-transfected cells were also unresponsive to peg-IFN-\u03b1-2b treatment ( Supplementary Fig. 6B ). IFN-\u03bb1 pre-treatment also resulted in an attenuated response to exogenous IFN-\u03b1, and the response to IFN-\u03b1 was almost completely blocked by the combination of IFN-\u03bb1 pre-treatment and IFN-\u03bb4 gene transfection (Fig. 4C ). This indicates the importance of additional IFN-\u03bb4 protein in IFNL4-\u2206G/TT or IFNL4-\u2206G/\u2206G hosts. We also confirmed the unresponsiveness to exogenous IFN-\u03b1 by IFN-\u03bbs using recombinant IFN-\u03bb proteins including IFN-\u03bb4 (Fig. 4D ).",

Among the proteins enriched in HCV-infected liver, USP18 has been reported to confer unresponsiveness to IFN-\u03b1 by interacting with IFNAR2 and inhibits downstream signals induced by IFN-\u03b1 22 . In fact, USP18 overexpression decreases the responsiveness to exogenous IFN-\u03b1 23 . Recent reports show that intracellular free ISG15 protein maintains the stability of the USP18 protein in human cells 24, 25 , although ISG15 has direct antiviral properties against many viruses in mice 26 . ISG15 deficiency caused increased viral resistance in humans but not mice, since only human ISG15 interacted with USP18 and decreased the response to IFN-\u03b1 25 . More specifically, in human cells, free ISG15 stabilizes the USP18 protein by preventing its ubiquitination, leading to an attenuated response to IFN-\u03b1 24, 25 . Importantly, the ISGylation activity of ISG15 and the deISGylation activity of USP18 do not have any role in this process. It was shown that ISGylation-defective \u0394GG ISG15 also binds to USP18 and prevents its degradation 24 . Furthermore, previous studies reported that blocking of IFN-\u03b1 signaling by USP18 does not depend on the enzymatic activity of USP18 27 . The IFN-\u03b1 signal-blocking activity of USP18 is mediated by the binding of USP18 to the intracellular domain of IFNAR2, which prevents the binding of JAK1 to IFNAR2 27 .",

After 48 hours, the cells were re-transfected with the respective siRNAs. The cells were harvested, and gene expression was analysed by immunoblotting 24 hours after the second siRNA transfection. (D,E) Huh-7 cells were transfected with control, USP18-, or ISG15-targeting siRNAs. After 24 hours, the cells were transfected with control or IFN-\u03bb4-expressing plasmids. After 48 hours, the cells were re-transfected with the respective siRNAs. After 48 hours, the cells were treated with 100 IU/ml of IFN-\u03b1 for 15 minutes (D) or for 6 hours (E). Then the cells were harvested, and protein and gene expression were analysed by immunoblotting (D) or real-time qPCR (E). All the data are representative of two independent experiments. (F) Huh-7 cells were treated with or without 100 ng/mL recombinant IFN-\u03bb4. After 48 hours, the cells were transfected with control siRNAs, USP18-, or ISG15-targeting siRNAs. The USP18-, or ISG15-targeting siRNAs used in this experiment had different sequences from siRNAs used in the experiment for (D). After 48 hours, the cells were treated with 100 IU/ml of IFN-\u03b1 for 15 minutes. Then the cells were harvested, and protein expression were analysed by immunoblotting. (G) PHHs with IFNL4 \u0394G/\u0394G genotype were infected with JFH1 HCVcc at 15 MOI. After 6 hours, the cells were treated with 10 \u03bcg/ml anti-IFN-\u03bb1 and 10 \u03bcg/ml anti-IFN-\u03bb2/3 or IgG for 72 hours. The cells were harvested, and ISG15 gene expression was analysed by real-time qPCR. Data are presented as means \u00b1 S.E.M. **P \u2264 0.01, ***P \u2264 0.001 (Student's t-test).",
