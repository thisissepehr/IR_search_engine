A single, Day-ll bovine embryo collected nonsurgically from a mixed-breed beef cow was cultured in Ham's F10 medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum, sodium pyruvate, insulin, and epidermal growth factor. Alter 13 d in culture the embryo had adhered to the surface of the plastic culture vessel and a monolayer covering 0.3 cm 2 had developed in the manner of a tissue explant. The monolayer was successfully dispersed using trypsin-EDTA and the cells were passaged. Expansion to a 25-cm 2 flask was achieved by the 4th passage. By passaging cultures at a dilution ratio of 1:2, cells were maintained for 38 passages before growth slowed. Transfers beyond the 44th passage were unsuccessful. The cell line, designated BE-13, was successfully frozen and thawed at the 9th, 12th, 15th, and 20th passages. The cell line contains both mono-and binucleate cells with a prominent rough endoplasmic reticulum characteristic of ruminant trophoblast cells. Susceptibility to eight bovine viruses was demonstrated. Such cell lines may provide inexpensive systems for the study of trophoblast metabolism and for investigation of the role of the trophoblast in the pathogenesis of selected bovine abortifacient diseases. Because of their range of viral susceptibility, these cells might also be useful for diagnostic purposes.",

Cultures from both species contained a myriad of cell types that produced proteins similar to fetal plasma proteins. In the same study ovine trophoblast protein 1 was identified in cultures established from sheep blastocysts. Their efforts demonstrated that cell culture systems for the production of the secretory products of trophoblast cells were 750 feasible. However, primary cultures were established from dispersions of multiple embryos, and although cultures were maintained for several weeks, cells were not passaged and trophoblast cells were not observed to divide beyond a few days. These workers suggested that relatively pure populations of trophoblast cells dissected from intact blastocysts could be established under proper culture conditions and specific trophoblast products could be harvested. Such cultures would also be useful for studying the effects of uterine secretory products on the trophoblast as well as the study of the pathogenesis of agents that are known to selectively invade the trophoblast.",

This secretion was seen at the leading edge of the monolayers, and was so thick on the surface that it prevented clear visualization of the cells underneath. Masses of dense undifferentiated cells as well as trophoblastic vesicles grew on the surface of these monolayers and they also appeared to degenerate after 2 to 3 wk if left undisturbed. Ansell and Snow (2) observed that hatched mouse blastocysts attached to the surface of culture vessels and trophoblast giant cells grew out as a monolayer, but in the absence of inner cell mass (ICM) cells, their division ceased. Gardner {5) also reported that trophoblastic fragments required the presence of ICM cells for their development. A number of our primary explants seemed to continue to expand in the absence of large numbers of other cell types; therefore, we felt that there was a possibility of dispersing the monolayer explant and establishing secondary cultures.",

The Day-ll embryo used to establish this line gave rise to a rapidly growing monolayer providing an extraordinarily large number of young, rapidly dividing cells for transfer. We have found that explants from earlier stage blastocysts are not capable of developing to this extent. The importance of the presence of other cell types to the survival and growth of the trophoblast cells during the initial passages cannot be definitively stated; however, a large number of free-floating cells were present during these early passages. Between passages, fresh medium was added, when necessary, after a portion of the old medium was carefully siphoned out, allowing most of the free-floating cells to remain. By the 8th passage, only the large, flat mono-and binucleate ceils displaying prominent filaments were observed (Figs. 4 and 5}. The mono-and binuehate morphology is characteristic of ruminant trophoblast cells (13L The spherical shape of the RER visible in these cells has also been seen in the trophoblast of the goat {1 L The generally accepted concept of protein production of Siekevitz and Palade {12} is that dilated RER is associated with the synthesis of secretory protein, whereas free ribosomes are involved with formation of structural proteins. Presumably, the dilated RER seen in these cells at the 33rd passage is the source of secretory protein.",

We found that the cells were extremely sensitive to trypsin activity and that 1:2 is the most desirable cell dilution ratio. Important factors in attempts to establish duplicate cell lines seem to be the selection of embryos at the proper stage of development, the presence of a critical number of young, rapidly growing cells in the monolayer explants, the judicious use of trypsin for dispersion of cells, and sufficiently dense seeding of cells. As previously stated, free-floating cells may also be necessary in the early passages. Although the use of specific attachment factors may be beneficial for enhancing the survival of a number of different cell types, their absence would seem to select for the perpetuation of pure populations of trophoblast cells.",
