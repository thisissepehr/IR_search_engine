            "text": "THE ability of African trypanosomes to establish chronic infections in their mammalian hosts depends on a highly developed system of antigenic variation, whereby individual members of the parasite population change the composition of their surface coae-3 . This antigenic variation is controlled at the level of gene expression 4 ,5, each trypanosome possessing a large repertoire of genes (estimated at over 100; refs 6, 7) coding for the antigenically distinct variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs) which comprise the coat. At anyone time and on anyone trypanosome, only one species ofVSG can be detected 8 , suggesting that mutual exclusion operates between the VSG genes. Activation of VSG genes occurs by a two-step process requiring first the duplication and transposition of a silent basic copy (BC) of the gene into one of a few telomeric expression sites by a process equivalent to gene conversion, then selection of the expression site over others for transcription9-ls. The extra copy of the gene thus produced is called the expression-linked copy (ELC). The socalled 'non-duplication-activated' VSG genes described by others probably represent genes which had already undergone the first step in activation (that is, gene conversion into an expression site) before the variants were isolated for study. Although the structure of expression sites and the sequences involved in the gene conversion event have been identified for some variants l 6--19, little is known about the second step, particularly how activation occurs and how the mutual exclusion operates between the different expression sites.",

The genomic location of the 35-base pair (bp) mini-exon coding for the spliced leader has recently been reported to be a 1.35-kilobase pair (kb) segment tandemly repeated 100-200 times (as one or more clusters) at an unidentified locus in the ~enome but at least 30 kb upstream of the active VSG gene 20 ,2 . Two other important observations concerning the spliced leader are that it is detected on many RNA molecules of varying size in blot analyses using RNA from different life stage forms of Trypanosoma brucei (ref. 21 and M. Parsons et al., personal communication) and that homologous sequences have been detected in the genomes of related species and genera 22 .",

This was initially done using a PvuII digest of the genomic DNA of T. brucei as this enzyme has been reported to release the mini-ex on-containing portion of the repeat as a discrete band at -720 bp21. Such a band was excised from an agarose gel, the DNA purified by electroelution 24 and ligated into the PvuII site of the plasmid vector pBR322 (ref. 25). A sample of this same excised material was radiolabelled by nick-translation 26 and used as a probe in colony hybridization 27 , thereby identifying recombinants containing repetitive DNA. Four plasmids thus identified were further characterized and three were found to contain indistinguishable inserts with at least one RsaI site. As the mini-exon should include an RsaI site, nucleotide sequence analysis in the vicinity of this site was performed on one of the plasmids (pMEP.1). The strategy and sequence obtained are shown in Figs I and 2, respectively. This demonstrated unambiguously that pMEP.I contains a portion of the mini-exon repeat.",

This antigenic variation is controlled at the level of gene expression 4 ,5, each trypanosome possessing a large repertoire of genes (estimated at over 100; refs 6, 7) coding for the antigenically distinct variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs) which comprise the coat. At anyone time and on anyone trypanosome, only one species ofVSG can be detected 8 , suggesting that mutual exclusion operates between the VSG genes. Activation of VSG genes occurs by a two-step process requiring first the duplication and transposition of a silent basic copy (BC) of the gene into one of a few telomeric expression sites by a process equivalent to gene conversion, then selection of the expression site over others for transcription9-ls. The extra copy of the gene thus produced is called the expression-linked copy (ELC). The socalled 'non-duplication-activated' VSG genes described by others probably represent genes which had already undergone the first step in activation (that is, gene conversion into an expression site) before the variants were isolated for study. Although the structure of expression sites and the sequences involved in the gene conversion event have been identified for some variants l 6--19, little is known about the second step, particularly how activation occurs and how the mutual exclusion operates between the different expression sites.",

The genomic location of the 35-base pair (bp) mini-exon coding for the spliced leader has recently been reported to be a 1.35-kilobase pair (kb) segment tandemly repeated 100-200 times (as one or more clusters) at an unidentified locus in the ~enome but at least 30 kb upstream of the active VSG gene 20 ,2 . Two other important observations concerning the spliced leader are that it is detected on many RNA molecules of varying size in blot analyses using RNA from Several models have been proposed to explain how a contiguous mRNA is produced from such an unusual arrangement of exons 2 0- 23 and how the activity of different expression sites is regulated. These have included chromosome end exchange with splicing of very long transcripts, and discontinuous transcription whereby the mini-exon and ELC are flanked by their own initiation and termination sites.

Alternatively, they may be a result of protection by hybrid transcripts comprising the small RNA at their 5/ ends linked to RNA from, for example, the ELC region, by the mechanisms discussed below. The second method to detect and size transcripts from the mini-exon repeat used Northern blot analysis 31 \u2022 For this procedure, total trypanosome RNA was resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in denaturing conditions, transferred to GeneScreen membrane 32 and hybridized with a [5/ -32 P]_labelled, synthetic oligonucleotide complementary to positions + 117 to +133. This 17 -mer was chosen because it excluded the mini-exon itself, which was known to give intense hybridization throughout RNA blots when used as a probe 21 and because the Sl-protection experiments indicated that it should hybridize to mini-ex on-derived transcripts. Figure 4a shows the ethidium bromide stain of a polyacrylamide/7 M urea gel in which the major small RNA species is readily apparent. Figure 4b presents the autoradiogram produced after hybridizing a GeneScreen transfer of a duplicate half of this gel with the 17-mer; only one band is detected in the track containing trypanosome RNA and no signal is observed in the track containing RNA from the unrelated parasitic protozoan, Toxoplasma gondii. The size of the band is -140 nucleotides based on published values for the small ribosomal RNAs of trypanosomes 33 , thus confirming that the mini-ex on repeats are transcribed to yield a short, discrete RNA which we have termed mini-exon-derived RNA (medRNA). With regard to its precise size, this result is, within experimental error, consistent with medRNA being 137 nucleotides long. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that medRNA is as many as 4-5 nucleotides longer and that Sl nuclease nonspecifically digested the 3/ end of the RNA/DNA hybrid. Note, however, that the nucleotides at positions 138 and 140 are cytosines which, as CG pairs, would be less susceptible to such action. A definite answer awaits 3/-sequence analysis of medRNA. Methods: a, A [3/-32 P]-end-labelled Pvull digest of pMES.1 was re-cut with EcoRI to generate a uniquely end-labelled fragment corresponding to positions +59 to +183 plus 375 bp of the vector (see Fi \u00a7. I). S} protection was done essentially as described elsewhere 3 \u2022 Briefly, the probe was mixed with different fractions of bloodstream-fonn RNA, precipitated, redissolved and denatured in 80% fonnamide at 80\u00b7C for 10 min. Renaturation of RNA/DNA hybrids was promoted by incubating at 45 \u00b7C for 3 h in the same buffer, before diluting with 10 vol of aqueous buffer, cooling to 30\u00b7C and adding 35 units ofS} nuclease. Digestion was for 30 min, after which the reactions were phenol-extracted, isopropanolprecipitated, resuspended in fonnamide loading buffer 43 and resolved by PAGE in a 6% polyacrylamide gel with 7 M urea 44 \u2022 b, A 15-30% linear sucrose gradient was prepared in 0.1 M NaCI, I mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.5), 0.1 % SDS. About I mg of total trypanosome RNA was overlaid with the same buffer and the samples spun in an SW-41 rotor (Beckman) at 40,000 r.p.m. at 20\u00b7C for 9.5 h. Fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube and the A 260 measured.

            "text": "These results also suggest that the 5/ -terminus of medRN A is at about position + 1 in the mini-ex on repeat. To confirm this, we used the synthetic oligonucleotide from the RNA blot analyses as a primer for reverse transcriptase extensions of medRNA. The result (Fig. 5) shows a major band co-migrating with a heterologous DNA marker of 135 nucleotides. Using a different heterologous marker (a HindIII digest of bacteriophage A DNA), the size of this band was estimated as 133 nucleotides. This slight discrepancy is probably due to differences in base composition. Allowing for this variation, the extension has an approximate length of 134 \u00b1 1 nucleotides. Given that the 5'-end of the primer represents position +133 of the mini-exon repeat, this result confirms that the 5'-end of medRNA corresponds to position +1, the same as that found for the spliced leader of mature VSG mRNAs I3 ,14. The minor band in Fig. 5 at 138\u00b1 I nucleotides may be an artefact of reverse transcriptase (for example, loop-back synthesis) or it may be indicative of a minor RNA 4 nucleotides longer than the major species. Such minor heterogeneity might be due to variation in the mini-exon repeat sequences and/or in the site of transcriptional initiation. No other major bands were observed in other loadings of this sample run for longer or shorter periods (data not shown). ",

As the sequences in both cases were determined from two plasmids, the differences may be indicative of minor, but real, variation in the repeats. In addition to the region coding for medRNA, each 1.35-kb mini-exon repeat contains about 1,200 nucleotides whose function is not clear; part of this region is presumably involved in the regulation of medRNA expression, but the remainder could be involved in some other aspect of trypanosome gene expression. Of particular note is the repetitive nature of the sequence around the Sau3A site, consisting of 1-, 2-, 4-and 6-nucleotide repeats (T, AT/ AC, ATTT/GTTT and ACACTC, respectively). It will be interesting to determine whether these regions of the repeat are as exactly conserved as that coding for the medRNA.",

The termination site cannot be compared with the general case as too few sequences of eukaryotic transcriptional terminators have been reported to enable consensus sequences to be made. Recently, the complete sequence of a small nuclear RNA (snR3) and its gene have been reported in yease Z , 35. This transcription unit shows remarkable similarity to the mini-exon repeat at four critical positions (Fig. 6) , the remainder of the two sequences sharing no significant homologies. First, the snR3 gene also has the octanucleotide T A TTTTTG centred at position -27 relative to the start site for transcription.

Third, both sequences, although of different overall length (137 versus 194 nucleotides for medRNA and snR3, respectively), end near the beginning of an extremely T-rich region.

However, it is not definitive because of the multiplicity of the mini-exon repeats: it could be that, although the majority of the repeats are indeed transcribed to give the short medRNA, one repeat is used in the initiation of a very long transcript including the VSG coding exon. This is a difficult possibility to exclude because pulse-chase experiments, which have been traditionally used to demonstrate precursor/product relationships, suffer from the same shortcoming-it is impossible to demonstrate that a given mini-exon repeat is used for one purpose compared with another, indistinguishable repeat. Nevertheless, together with published observations regarding the abundance of transcripts containing mini-exon-derived sequences and the inability to detect linkage between a mini-exon sequence and the VSG coding ex on, the identification of a short, discrete medRNA strongly supports a model of discontinuous transcription.

There are two general schemes by which this can most easily be imagined to occur. The first model, presented in Fig. 7 a, predicts that RNA polymerase transcribes the medRNA and then dissociates from the mini-exon repeat, possibly as a medRNA/polymerase complex; transcription then reinitiates just upstream of the ELC using medRNA as a primer. The second model (Fig. 7 b) proposed that medRNA and the codingregion RNA are independently produced as discrete transcripts and then post-transcriptionally ligated to each other.

Coronavirus transcripts, on the other hand, are known to have a common 5'-leader sequence which is seemingly not joined to the coding portion of the RNA by conventional splicing, again strongly suggesting discontinuous transcription 38 ,39. The fact that, in both these cases, transcription occurs by an RNA-dependent viral transcriptase may be an important distinction but they do provide a mechanistic precedent for discontinuity in primary transcripts.

It could not acquire such angular momentum during an ejection event unless a physical collision was involved, which is quite unlikely.
