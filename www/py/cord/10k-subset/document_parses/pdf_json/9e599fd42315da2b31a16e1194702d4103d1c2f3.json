The most common infections associated with STSS are listed in Table 1 . The incidence of invasive GAS infection is one to five cases per 100,000 population per year [2] , and approximately 20% of these cases are STSS. Most cases are primary and sporadic in nature, although epidemics of invasive GAS infections have been described in specific geographic settings. In 1994, an epidemic of related invasive infections occurred in Winnamango, MN [3] , with an annualized prevalence of 24 cases per 100,000 population. Five years later in Missoula, MT, the incidence of invasive infections reached 30 cases per 100,000 population (Stevens, Personal observation). Similarly, from November to December 2002, there was an epidemic of invasive GAS infections among Marine Corp recruits at the San Diego Naval Training Base [4] . In addition to community-based infections, invasive GAS infections have been described in hospitals, convalescent centers, and among hospital employees and family contacts of patients with invasive infections [5] [6] [7] . Some of these studies have documented the same M type and identical restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns in strains from primary and index cases [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

Identification of the site and appropriate surgical intervention to remove necrotic infected foci is extremely important, and infectious disease specialists and intensive care unit physicians play a huge role in orchestrating a timely approach. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans are very helpful in locating the site of primary infection, but because GAS does not form gas or frank abscess, a radiologist's interpretation is often not definitive. A scan demonstrating swelling or edema in the deep tissues in a patient who is toxic may be the best indication of deep-seated infection. Laboratory tests demonstrating marked left shift, elevated creatinine, and high CPK should provide further impetus to encourage surgical evaluation. Although this approach to source control is much easier for infections on an extremity, the stakes get higher and the problem more difficult for GAS infection involving the abdomen, thorax, head, or neck. For example, in postpartum sepsis caused by Clostridium perfringens, there is extensive gas in the uterus, and the decision to operate is easy. In postpartum sepsis caused by GAS, the uterus may only appear to be modestly edematous according to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, a condition difficult to distinguish from the normal uterus 2 to 4 days postpartum. Surgical intervention may not be possible in some cases because of shock or anatomic location of the infection. Surgically obtained specimens with Gram stain and culture provide a definitive diagnosis and provide direction for future source control issues.",

Luckily, most strains of GAS remain sensitive to clindamycin, although erythromycin and clindamycin resistance is common in Italy. When sensitivities are available, there is not much justification for continuing penicillin. Knowledge of the susceptibility patterns of GAS in your region is important.

Pressors such as dopamine are used frequently, although no controlled trials have been performed in STSS. In patients with intractable hypotension, vasoconstrictors such as epinephrine have also been used, but symmetrical gangrene of digits often results (Stevens, Personal observation). Loss of all digits on both hands and feet, or loss of both arms and both legs, has occurred in this setting. It is difficult to determine if symmetrical gangrene is caused in these cases by pressors, coagulopathy, or both.

However, there is batch-to-batch variation, and standardization is sorely needed. Case reports [41, 42] and one nonrandomized clinical trial [40] report that commercial intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is useful for treating STSS. A double-blind study using IVIG in Scandanavia may provide a definitive answer to this question. In contrast, Sriskandan et al.

In addition, patients may acquire GAS from hospital personnel. This was best demonstrated by Semmelwise in Vienna in 1861 and Holmes in the United States in 1892, although even today such transmission is well-documented [10, 47, 48] . It has been estimated that the risk of secondary cases of STSS may be approximately 50 to 200 times greater than the risk among the general population [49] . However, because of the low frequency of primary cases (one to five cases/100,000 population/year), the risk of secondary invasive GAS infection is still very low (ie, 50 to 1000 cases/100,000 population/year). GAS is a highly infectious agent, and transmission of GAS from person to person is very common. This is exemplified by studies of pharyngitis and rheumatic fever conducted over several centuries showing that GAS is quickly and efficiently transmitted from index cases to susceptible individuals. Depending on the era, the strain of GAS, and the geographic region, such transmission has resulted in many clinical conditions, including asymptomatic colonization, pharyngitis, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, or more recently, invasive GAS infections. Recently, 25 hospital personnel in San Francisco who cared for one patient with streptococcal sepsis caused by an M-1 strain of GAS became colonized with an identical strain within 5 days of the patient's admission to the hospital. Although some patients developed mild pharyngitis, none developed invasive GAS infection, and most were merely colonized.",
