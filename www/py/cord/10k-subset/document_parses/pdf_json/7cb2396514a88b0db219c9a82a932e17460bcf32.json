We have studied the pattern of lymphocyte recruitment following partial transection of the mouse spinal cord. Using immunohistochemical techniques, all three types of lymphocytes (CD4-positive T-cells, CD8positive T-cells and B-cells) were found in the vicinity of the lesion site within hours and persisted for up to 7 days. There was a predominance of B-lymphocytes during the first 3 days. A second, late phase of cell infiltration, dominated by CD8-positive T-lymphocytes, occurred in mice that had been raised in a conventional breeding unit and had acquired antibody titres to a common murine virus (mouse hepatitis virus). In contrast, mice kept in specific pathogen-free facilities did not show this late-phase response. These findings suggest a possible role for lymphocytes in secondary tissue loss, local demyelination, scar formation, cytokine-mediated inflammatory responses or trophic processes.

In addition to the well documented monocytel macrophagelmicroglia and the neutrophil contribution, immunocytochemistry has allowed us to see that lymphocytes are also part of the population of inflammatory cells invading the lesion site.

The response during the first day was dominated by B-lymphocytes, and the proportion of these cells was much larger than in the blood. Thus, selective recruitment of these cells appears to occur.

The serum of CU animals was found to contain antibodies against MHV, a coronavirus which can lead to subclinical infection at 3-4 weeks of age. Being highly infectious, this virus is commonly found in conventional breeding facilities and often escapes detection (Homberger and Thomann, 1994) .
