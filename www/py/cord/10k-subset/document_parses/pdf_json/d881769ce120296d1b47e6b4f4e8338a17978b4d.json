However, the mechanisms governing the development of complications remain poorly studied. The present work reports the comparative assessment of the functional changes which take place in human ECV-304 endothelial cell sublines obtained previously by the longterm culturing of cells after exposure to varying infectious doses (IDs) of influenza A virus, and/or bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). It has been demonstrated that, in the course of long-term culturing (six passages) after exposure to pathogenic agents (influenza virus and/or LPS), endothelial cells maintain changes in their migratory activity, permeability, and expression of mRNA for cytokines TNF\u03b1 and TGF\u03b2 (along with the changes in their proliferation activity, which has been demonstrated earlier). The pattern of changes depended on the type of the agent (agents) to which the cells were exposed. The differences in migratory activity (which was at its maximum 4 h after wounding) between the cell sublines at the sixth passage correlated with the differences in their proliferation activity at the first passage (proliferation data were obtained previously). In particular, an increase in migration and proliferation was observed in the sublines exposed to low virus doses (ECV-1ID), as well as exposed to LPS (ECV-LPS), while the suppression of migration and proliferation was observed in the subline exposed to high virus doses (ECV-1000ID). In the ECV-1ID, ECV-LPS, and most notably in ECV-1ID + LPS sublines, we detected an increase in the expression of mRNA for cytokines TNF\u03b1 and TGF\u03b2, which, however, didn't lead to the induction of apoptosis. We have also demonstrated an increase in cell permeability in the analyzed sublines, which was indicated by a decrease in the expression of the mRNAs for the genes encoding occludin and ZO-1, the tight junctions proteins. This paper also reports an evaluation of the effects of the antiviral preparations rimantadine and alpisarin on the functional state of cell sublines. As a result, it has been demonstrated that these drugs may be able to prevent the development of the pathological changes caused by influenza A virus and/or LPS in endothelial cells.

The results obtained in the present work, as well as in the previous one (Smirnova et al., 2018) , show that all sublines of endothelial cells acquire resistance to apoptosis in the process of culturing (after the third passage), notwithstanding the high level of expression of mRNA for both TNF\u03b1 and TGF\u03b2, especially in the ECV-1ID + LPS subline. This indicates a link between the cytokines TNF\u03b1 and TGF\u03b2 and the increase in cell permeability, but not the induction of apoptosis in this case. This conclusion is supported also by the fact that, in the presence of the antivirals rimantadine and alpisarin, expression of TNF\u03b1 and TGF\u03b2 genes is inhibited and cell permeability is restored (due to the increase in the CLDR5 mRNA expression) with a simultaneous increase in the apoptosis level, which also indicates that these drugs are capable of restoring the functional state of the cells. It is characteristic that the level of NOX4 mRNA expression appeared to be only slightly increased and only in a single subline, which was obtained after the infection with the low dose of influenza virus (ECV-1ID) and differed from all others in its increased proliferation level. This allows it to be suggested that the dysfunction of cells in the analyzed sublines that develops over the period of their long-term culturing may be caused by the increase in ROS content not only in the cytosol (produced by Nox2 and Nox4 oxidases), but, apparently, to a greater extent in mitochondria (Harel et al., 2017) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 236, "end": 255, "text": "(Kasa et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 331, "end": 354, "text": "(Smirnova et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1735, "end": 1755, "text": "(Harel et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The multifunctional cytokine TGF\u03b2 can enhance cell proliferation and apoptosis resistance through the ALK5 Smad 2/3/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, which induces the transformation of endothelial cells into miofibroblasts (van Meeteren and ten Dijke, 2012; Montorfano et al., 2014) . TGF\u03b2 is considered to be the key cytokine participating in fibrosis. Reduced sensitivity of lung fibroblasts to Fas-induced apoptosis (resistance to apoptosis) with increased alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis level is a characteristic feature of pulmonary fibrosis, in which the regions of a disrupted epithelial cell layer with reduced reparation capacity are filled with apoptosis-resistant fibroblasts (Maher et al., 2010; Liu and Desai, 2015) . Our findings (increased expression level for TGF\u03b2 mRNA along with the development of apoptosis resistance) provide support for the idea that there is a link between influenza virus infection and, especially, LPS treatment with myofibroblast formation and the possibility of pulmonary fibrosis development. Thus, the addition of LPS at the time of ECV-304 cell infection with influenza A virus leads to a more serious dysfunction of endothelial cells, in the same way as a secondary bacterial infection, even in the case of mild influenza infection leads to serious and, in many cases, complications that occur much later (McCullers, 2006) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 250, "end": 274, "text": "Montorfano et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 683, "end": 703, "text": "(Maher et al., 2010;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 704, "end": 724, "text": "Liu and Desai, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1348, "end": 1365, "text": "(McCullers, 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Our data also indicate that endothelial cells infected only with influenza A virus may become atypical (demonstrate increased proliferation activity and an extremely low apoptosis level), which may facilitate the expansion of these cells and hinder the reparation of damaged blood vessel regions with normal endothelial cells.
