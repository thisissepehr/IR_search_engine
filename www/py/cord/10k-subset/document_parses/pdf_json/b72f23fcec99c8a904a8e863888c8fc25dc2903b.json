An important part of these errors are attributable to ''Human Factors''. Ineffective communication and incorrect preparation for invasive procedures may expose patients to unnecessary risks. The intensive care unit (ICU) environment is especially prone to these errors. Since three decades commercial and military aviation have adopted the Crew Resource Management (CRM) approach to mitigate the negative effects of unavoidable ''Human Errors''. The adult and pediatric intensive care department of the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre has adopted the CRM principles. Implementation: Since 2010 more than 350 medical and nursing ICU staff members completed a two-day awareness course into CRM principles and human factors. Simultaneously, important local obstructions in patient care with regard to communication and patient safety were identified. The most important obstructions were addressed by assigning specific safety tools. Examples are: checklists, briefing and debriefing procedures and a structured patient handover form. Furthermore a system was designed to assure continuous development and adherence to CRM rules. Since the introduction, checklist procedures are felt to provide improved safety and support. At the same time professional communication between medical and nursing staff can still be improved. The CRM approach described represents a new culture that also requires a new professional behavior, the acceptance of which is not without challenges.

Procalcitonin (PCT) is a surrogate biomarker for estimating the likelihood of a bacterial infection. PCT-guided therapy is a novel approach to optimize antibiotic therapy management. Postnatal and gestational age dependent normal values of PCT challenge the accurate use of PCT in neonatal sepsis. Variable clinical settings influence diagnostic accuracy of PCT and make a context dependent interpretation mandatory. Keeping this in mind, separate evaluation of neonatal early-onset sepsis, neonatal late-onset sepsis and sepsis/meningitis in children are required. In general, PCT shows a higher accuracy in sepsis diagnosis compared to other infection markers and PCT-guided therapy is able to reduce duration of antibiotic therapy.

Such studies are difficult to perform, since the incidence of the disorder is low and its manifestation may vary in every patient. Consequently, dietary management is highly variable. Critical illness can be defined as a life threatening condition mostly resulting from infection, sepsis and trauma and accompanied by similar physiological and biochemical responses, which have been termed the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The associated metabolic, endocrine, nervous and immunological changes are also known as the acute stress response. Depending on the severity of initial insult pronounced neuroendocrine and metabolic alterations will occur. A key feature is increased sympathetic nervous system activity, resulting in increased levels of adrenaline and glucocorticoids. Subsequently, immune cells are activated and pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted, which trigger further metabolic changes. In addition, insulin secretion is increased as well as the counter regulatory hormones glucagon, catecholamines, cortisol and growth hormone. As a result, glucose production is increased via increased glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis and insulin resistance develops, leading to hyperglycemia. Also, fat is mobilized (lipolysis) and fat oxidation and ketone body formation are increased, while muscle protein breakdown is stimulated to provide amino acids for protein synthesis in proliferating cells, the production of acute phase proteins and other peptides (e.g. cytokines) and for gluconeogenesis. Traditionally, in critically adult patients the metabolic response to injury and sepsis is characterized by an ebb and flow phase. The course of critical illness in children differs from adults because critical illness may develop quickly and also recovery can be rapidly. Understanding the metabolic, endocrine nervous and immunological changes of pediatric critical illness is important and may improve outcome, as it allows the rational use of pharmaceutical interventions. Doppler Ultrasound of the cerebral arteries is an easily available bedside method. It is useful after hyoxaemic ischaemic insult, cerebral vascular surgery or head trauma. Resistive and pulsatile Index are the most frequent taken measurements but cannot be used as single value to judge adequate or failing cerebral perfusion or intracranial pressure.

Critically ill children requiring mechanical ventilation almost always receive sedative and analgesic drugs.

Therefore, sedation and analgesia are recognized as important areas of PICU nursing practice. The Pain and Sedation nursing study group of the ESPNIC-Nursing Science section developed a concept position statement Sedation and Withdrawal Assessment in PICU patients. In addition an extensive search of the available literature was performed for supporting evidence. Relevant published studies were identified through broad searches of the MEDLINE, EMBASE and CHINAL databases.

Results suggest several possible elements that may be helpful in framing interdisciplinary dialogue and informing institutional practices in the design of a pediatric DCD program. Pressure ulcers (PU) represent a serious yet preventable iatrogenic injury. Most healthcare organizations track their PU prevalence rates to describe the quality of care they provide within their institution. These data are also used to benchmark care quality across healthcare organizations. To better understand an institution's PU rate, it is important to understand their patient populations' level of risk for PU. Successful PU prevention programs should be assessed from a perspective of identifying at-risk patients who remain PU free. Tools that describe PU risk should predict patients at risk and patients not at risk for PU development. The Braden Q Scale for predicting pediatric PU risk is a widely used valid and reliable pediatric-specific PU risk assessment tool. Since its publication in 1996, requests for clarification on how best to use the tool across the spectrum of pediatric patients commonly cared for in healthcare organizations have been received. Common clarifications include using the Braden Q Scale as originally designed; specifically, not using untested derivations of the tool and not using the Braden Q Scale to predict medical devicerelated PU. Validation of a new tool, the Braden Q + D Scale for predicting both immobility-related and medical device-related pediatric PU risk, is currently underway. This session will provide information on how best to score a patient's risk for PU. Accurate assessment of patient risk is the first step in guiding appropriate interventions that prevent PU.

The mean z-score weight-forage was -1.11 (p = 0.009). Extremes of weight-for-age were more prevalent in the PIC cohort than the reference population. A plot of weight-for-age z-score vs. SMR (figure 1) demonstrated increased mortality at both extremes of weight-for-age.

Conclusion: We have demonstrated that the PIC population weightfor-age distribution does differ from that of the general population, with a significantly lower mean. Furthermore, extremes of weight-forage at admission are a risk factor for mortality. These findings were consistent across age and gender sub-groups. Objectives and study: To investigate the efficacy of zinc in reducing morbidity and mortality of preterm neonates. Methods: Prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled study enrolling very low birth weight neonates randomly allocated at 7 days of life to ''active treatment'' (oral zinc supplementation at 10 mg/kg/day, in a multivitamin preparation) or to ''placebo'' (similar multivitamins preparation without zinc). The main endpoint was morbidity, defined by the presence of at least one of the following conditions: late-onset sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leucomalacia and retinopathy of prematurity. Secondary outcomes were mortality and growth at discharge. Results: We enrolled 97 neonates in the active treatment group and 96 in the placebo group.

Objectives: High-dose barbiturates may be used to treat intractable raised intracranial pressure (ICP) following traumatic brain injury (TBI) when maximal first-tier interventions have failed. However paediatric studies are limited with no consensus regarding optimal monitoring. We sought to describe current thiopental coma practice in UK paediatric intensive care units (PICUs). Methods: An online survey was distributed via UK Paediatric Intensive Care Society Study Group (PICS-SG), registered as an audit. Mandatory multiple-choice and open questions covered indications for thiopental coma, administration methods, monitoring effectiveness, side-effects and thiopental cessation. Results: Fifteen of 32 UK PICUs completed the survey including 11/16 (69 %) PICUs admitting [10 children annually requiring ICP monitoring. Thiopental coma for intractable intracranial hypertension following TBI is used in 12/15 responder units. Five units (42 %) do not use a protocol to guide management. Response in ICP is the main outcome measure to monitor effectiveness of thiopental coma in 8 (66 %) units; this is combined with EEG monitoring in 6 units. Three units specified administering thiopental boluses to desired ICP response, then titrating infusions to achieve burst suppression on EEG. Recognised side-effects include hypotension (11/ 12), infection (7/12) and gastrointestinal disturbance (5/12). Reasons to stop thiopental coma include adequate ICP control (10/12), achieving burst suppression (7/12) and unacceptable side-effects (7/12). Conclusions: There is wide variation in practice in thiopental coma use in intractable raised ICP in UK PICUs. This study highlights the need for collaboration to rationalize thiopental use in intractable intracranial hypertension in paediatric brain injury.

Background & aim: In adults receiving therapeutic hypothermia (TH) following cardiac arrest (CA), deteriorated microcirculatory perfusion (MP) and peripheral capillary refill time (pCRT) are associated with mortality. We aimed to study MP and pCRT during and after TH in pediatric CA patients in relation to mortality. Methods: Buccal MP (Sidestream Dark Field Imaging) and pCRT (evaluated by nursing staff) were measured at 0-12 (T1) and 12-24 h (T2) following start of TH, during re-warming (T3), and at normothermia (T4). Primary parameters were small (S; \u00d8: 0-10 lm) and non-small (NS; \u00d8: 11-100 lm) perfused vessel density (PVD-S, PVD-NS), microvascular flow index (MFI-S, MFI-NS), and normal pCRT (\\2 s). Data are presented as median (IQR) or number (%) and analyzed using non-parametric tests (*p \\ 0.05 vs. T1, # p \\ 0.05 vs. T2, p \\ 0.05 vs. T3). Results: Twenty-three patients, 11 non-survivors, were included. From T1 to T2, PVD-S and PVD-NS were unaltered ( Figure 1 ). T3 PVD-NS and T3 and T4 PVD-S were increased compared to T1 and T2. MFI-S and MFI-NS increased at T2-T4. Compared to T1-T3, pCRT normalized at T4. Non-survivors had lower T1 PVD-NS (4.9 vs. 6.6, p = 0.035), MFI-S (2.08 vs. 2.69, p = 0.037), and MFI-NS (2.38 vs. 2.73, p = 0.048). Conclusions: Low MP early after TH start is associated with mortality. After TH stop, MP and pCRT increased and remained increased irrespective of outcome.

Background and aim: Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) is a bedside single lead EEG monitoring tool to assess neonatal brain function and evaluate the presence of neonatal seizures. The aim of this project was to improve the current level of knowledge in nursing staff concerning the use of the digital aEEG monitor (Olympic CFM 6000). Main teaching targets were the assessment and classification of known background patterns (BP) and sleep-wake cycling (SWC); dealing with pitfalls (PF) and recognizing the presence of neonatal seizures (S). Methods: This research was performed from September 2011 to October 2012 within the tertiary NICU of the Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. A working group obtained expert knowledge in handling the aEEG monitor and correct interpretation of results. Clinical lectures for the nursing staff (N = 58) were implemented through theoretical background-and bedside teaching. A pre-lecture baseline (N = 35) and post-lecture test (N = 24) were held by written exam. Results: The level of knowledge in recognizing BP, SWC, S and PF showed a clinically significant improvement (respectively 56. 3, 84.7, 91 .0, and 100 %) compared to the baseline measurement (respectively 34.8, 80.0, 89, and 97.1 %) . General knowledge of aEEG showed also significant improvement. Conclusion: This study underlines the value of clinical training for nursing staff to improve daily care for NICU patients. BP recognition remained the most difficult to recognize. Motivating nursing staff to complete and participate in essential post test evaluation proved difficult and possibly influenced the results.

Neonates were divided into two study groups (30 neonates in each group) and administered either 0.2 ml of 24 % sucrose (active control) or 0.2 ml of 12 % sucrose 2 min prior to venepuncture. The entire procedure was video-recorded and Neonatal Facial Coding System (NFCS) used to evaluate pain. The NFCS was coded at pre-procedure, intra-procedure, post 30 s, 1 min and 2 min of procedure. The side effects were noted. Results: 60 ELBW neonates were enrolled, randomized and analyzed. The baseline characteristics of the group were comparable. The NFCS scores (Mean \u00b1 SD) in 12 versus 24 % sucrose were 0.63 \u00b1 1.35 and 0.46 \u00b1 0.86 in the pre-procedure observation the intraprocedure observation was 4.8 \u00b1 1.18 in 12 % and 4.46 \u00b1 1.5 in 24 % sucrose. Post 30 s observation was 1.1 \u00b1 1.64 in 12 % and 0.7 \u00b1 1.2 in 24 % sucrose No statistically significant difference between the NFCS scores was observed even at Post 1 min & Post 2 min of the procedure. 5 immediate adverse effects were observed (HR changes, transient desaturations and vomiting) however, no significant difference observed in adverse effects across the two study limbs. Conclusions: 0.2 ml of 12 % oral sucrose appears to be not-inferior to 0.2 ml of 24 % oral sucrose in reducing pain during venepuncture in ELBW neonates. There is no difference in side effects with either concentration of sucrose. Pain and sedation assessment in PICU is particulary important for nursing care and therapeutic success since it prevents risks associated to insufficient or excessive analgosedation. Optimal levels of mechanically ventilated children's comfort is an every day challenge for PICU staff. The objective of this study is to evaluate the validity and reliability of CBS in the Italian pediatric context. 24 patients admitted at one of the Intensive Care Units of the Emergency Department of Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital have been observed. The patients were mechanically ventilated and analgosedated through continuous infusion of ipnotics and oppiods. Two nurses observed together, but independently each patient before and after the procedure of tracheal suctioning, assessing vital signs, pain and sedation through the CBS and the Nurse Interpretation of Sedation Scale. In 14 cases there was a third nurse assessing the patient through the CBS with the objective to test the scale's reproducibility. A total of 50 observations was made. The study has been approved by the Ethics Committee and parent's of patients have signed informed consent. The 24 observed patients had a mean age of 7.46; 54 % were female, reason for admission was major surgery and acute respiratory failure. Median value of PIM was 2.1. The level of agreement between the two scales was high (88-78 %) . Comparison between vital signs and CBS values variations indicates that there isn't a total and continuous expected increase or reduction. Inter rater reliability was high (K = 1, K = 0.558). Internal consistency was positive (Cronbach's alpha 0.8). Objectives: A recent study in the NICU of Lille University Hospital showed the inaccuracy when preparing of vancomycin syringes by nurses. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of reconstitution solvent on the accuracy of vancomycin syringes. Methods: The commercial drug used was formulated as a powder for solution for intravenous infusion (vancomycin 250 mg, Mylan, France). We evaluated two types of solvent for the reconstitution of the vancomycin powder: 0.9 % sodium chloride (solvent used in the unit) and water for injections (solvent recommended by the manufacturer). Vancomycin syringes dosed at 40 mg were prepared according to the NICU protocol. Vancomycin amounts were determined by an UV spectrophotometric method. A Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the impact of two solvents with or without stirring of vials after reconstitution (n = 6). Results: Our results expressed as median values [min-max] in mg showed a significant difference between water for injection versus with 0.9 % sodium chloride and with or without stirring (p \\ 0.001).

Background: Critically ill children frequently receive inadequate nutritional support. Feeding protocols have been shown to help achieve optimal nutritional care. We aim to evaluate critical care nurses' understanding and preferred teaching methods before introduction of a nurse-led feeding protocol in our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). We hypothesized that nursing experience and education level are important factors in readiness to adopt this protocol. Method: All PICU nurses were invited to participate in an online survey (19 questions) to investigate perceptions on implementation of a feeding protocol and preferred teaching methods. Simple logistic regression and Fisher exact test were used for analysis with statistical significance taken as p \\ 0.05. Results: Seventy-four nurses completed the survey. Fifty-four had nursing degrees. Mean years of PICU experience was 6.2 (5th, 95th percentile: 1, 15) . 74 % (n = 55) felt that they did not have sufficient knowledge of a feeding protocol; 86 % (n = 64) were keen to explore implementing a feeding protocol. There was no association between readiness to adopt the feeding protocol with ICU nursing experience (OR: 0.99; 95th CI 0.84-1.18) and education level (OR 1.43; 95th CI 0.31-6.68). Preferred teaching methods are bedside teaching (61 %), didactic lectures (51 %) and distribution of protocol manuals (50 %) .

Birth, hospitalisation, discharge and the first weeks at home emerged as highly vulnerable phases. Parents of preterm and full-term children reported similar parenting challenges 2-3 years after birth and no difference was found in parenting stress (F(101.324) = .629, p = .430).

After administration with water or age-related foods, the availability for absorption of drugs from (manipulated) dosage forms was investigated. Results: Fast stomach emptying for pre-term neonate resulted in early absorption of caffeine, corresponding with in vivo (r = 0.99). Paracetamol showed a similar dose-response effect and t max compared to in vivo. Manipulation of esomeprazole tablets lead to early release and low availability due to degradation by gastric acid. Introduction: Validated morphine dosing algorithms are lacking for neonates and infants. A paediatric population pharmacokinetic model showed morphine clearance to non-linearly increase with bodyweight and be reduced by 50 % in neonates younger than 10 days [1, 2] . We prospectively evaluated the efficacy of the resulting age-adjusted morphine dosing algorithm in term neonates up to infants of 1 year of age. Methods: After major non-cardiac surgery, continuous morphine IV infusion of 2.5 lg/kg 1.5 /h was given in neonates younger than 10 days and 5 lg/kg 1.5 Methods: In this observational cohort study buccal MP (Sidestream Dark Field Imaging) was assessed before start of both dopamine and norepinephrine (T0), after start of dopamine (T1), and subsequently after start of norepinephrine (T2). Small (S; \u00d8: 0-10 lm) and nonsmall (NS; \u00d8: 11-100 lm) perfused vessel density (PVD-S, PVD-NS) and microvascular flow index (MFI-S, MFI-NS) were determined. MAP and heart frequency (HF) were recorded at T0-T2. Data are presented as median (IQR) and analyzed using parametric tests. Results: We included 10 CDH patients receiving 7 (5) mcg/kg min dopamine at T1 and 13 (5) mcg/kg min dopamine and 0.1 (0.2) mcg/ kg min norepinephrine at T2. MAP increased from T0 to T2 (see Table 1 ; A p \\ 0.05 vs. T0, B p \\ 0.05 vs. T1). HF remained unaltered between T0 and T1, but increased thereafter. In contrast, there were no changes over time in PVD-S, PVD-NS, MFI-S, or MFI-NS. Conclusion: Targeting MAP with dopamine and norepinephrine does not result in microcirculatory improvement in CDH patients. Background & aim: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) should not only provide macrocirculatory and/or respiratory support, but also microcirculatory support. Because venoarterial ECMO (VA) differs intrinsically from venovenous ECMO (VV) and different patient selection criteria apply, we hypothesized that microcirculatory perfusion (MP) is decreased before cannulation and increases immediately thereafter in VA whereas in VV there are no longitudinal differences. Methods: Buccal MP was assessed using Sidestream Dark Field Imaging before start (T0), at day 1-3 (T1-T3), and before (T4) and after stop (T5) of VA or VV. Small (S; \u00d8: 0-10 lm) and non-small (NS; \u00d8: 11-100 lm) perfused vessel density (PVD-S and PVD-NS) and microvascular flow index (MFI-S and MFI-NS) were determined. Data are presented as median (range) and analyzed using non-parametric tests (*p \\ 0.05). Results: We included 31 VA and 17 VV patients. From T0 to T1, PVD-S, PVD-NS, MFI-S, and MFI-NS were neither increased in VA nor in VV ( Figure 1 ). Background and aims: Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) may be caused by inadequate lung strain of the ratio of tidal volume (V T ) over functional residual capacity. It was reported that infant rats were less susceptible than adult rats when ventilated with a V T of 30 mL/ kg. We hypothesized that differences in lung strain explained the different occurrence of VILI between infant and adult rats. Methods: Infant (\u00b126 days), juvenile (\u00b16 weeks) and adult (\u00b112 weeks) male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied in an ex vivo lung model. Height and weight were measured. Lungs were excised, total lung capacity (TLC) measured. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error. Statistical analysis was done using one-way ANOVA with post hoc testing to compare between groups. P \\ 0.05 were accepted as statistically significant. Results: N = 79 rats were studied. TLC and total lung weight were not proportional to bodyweight (p \\ 0.001), but were proportional to height (p \\ 0.001). As such, the V T -to-TLC ratio was weight-dependent at a V T of 30 mL/kg (p \\ 0.001), signifying less strain in the infant rat (0.47 \u00b1 0.04) compared with the adult rat (0.91 \u00b1 0.02).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1414, "end": 1417, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1418, "end": 1420, "text": "2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1717, "end": 1720, "text": "1.5", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 610, "end": 617, "text": "(Table)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2430, "end": 2437, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF8"}, {"start": 3769, "end": 3777, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "-ORAL PRESENTATION"}, {"text": "Conclusions: Lung strain (V T -to-TLC ratio) at constant transpulmonary pressure was different between infant and adults rats when the delivered V T was dictated by 30 mL/kg, suggesting it is an inadequate surrogate for lung strain in the context of studying VILI throughout different age categories.

Background: The complaints against unethical behavior of medical students/professionals are proliferating. Though bioethics has gained priority in formal medical education, but is not much recognized everywhere. To design an ethical curriculum, it is necessary to assess the basic knowledge and attitude of medical teachers regarding bioethics, and equip them to impart same skills to the students to workout ethical dilemmas. Objectives: To assess knowledge, attitude and practice of medical teachers regarding medical ethics, and to sensitize the academicians for training of the teachers and making bioethics an integral part of the curricula. Background: Sildenafil is used to treat pulmonary hypertension (PAH) in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). However there is limited data to guide sildenafil dosing and weaning rate in CDH. This is of concern in light of a recent report of increased risk associated with high dose sildenafil regimens in non-CDH PAH [1] . Methods: Retrospective cohort study of sildenafil usage, dosing and weaning in infants with CDH at our institution. A sildenafil dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day was considered to be within safe limits based on current evidence [1] . Results: Seventeen percent (19/122) infants were discharged on sildenafil of median dose of 8 mg/kg/day (2.91-5.78 mg). Weaning rate was 0.1 (0.01-0.5) mg/kg/week. Infants ceased therapy at 343 days median duration. At 1 year of age 29 % were receiving a dose of sildenafil [1.5 mg/kg/day ( Figure 1 ). One infant died from severe PAH. Discussion: Sildenafil therapy at discharge is common in severe CDH. Variation in dosing and weaning rates highlights the need for To investigate the effect of the administration time of antenatal steroids (ANS) on blood pressure in very low birthweight infants, 120 infants weighing \\1,500 g were evaluated retrospectively. The study groups were classified as Group I (n = 40, without ANS), Group II (n = 40, ANS \\48 h before birth) and Group III (n = 40, ANS between 48 h and 7 days before birth). Systolic, diastolic and mean pressures measured by oscillometric method during the first 72 h after birth (with 2-h intervals) and heart rates were recorded. There was no difference among the study groups in terms of antenatal, perinatal and neonatal factors which can effect blood pressure except for respiratory distress syndrome which was less frequently seen in Group III (p = 0.016). Systolic pressure was higher on the 42nd and 48th hours (p = 0.046, p = 0.006), and diastolic pressure during the 6th-12th hour (p = 0.005, p = 0.022) and mean pressure on the 48th hour (p = 0.013) in Group II. During the first 72 h, the mean diastolic pressure was found to be lower in Group III (p = 0.034). whereas mean peak heart rate was lower among those in group I (p = 0.035) all of which were clinically irrelevant. Although clinically insignificant, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure values were found to be higher in infants whose mothers received ANS \\48 h before birth, close monitoring may be required for these infants during the first 48 h of life.

There is more work to be completed, but there is potential for this to be used in a critical care setting. Background and aims: Neonates with congenital heart disease (CHD) with low cardiac output and diminished perfusion states resulting in redistribution of cardiac output away from the mesenteric circulation are at risk of intestinal ischemia. Our objective was to evaluate feasibility of regional mesenteric oxygenation monitoring as an indicator of mesenteric perfusion. Methods: Two term newborns with CHD and low cardiac output were followed clinically and monitored by NIRS to detect possible mesenteric ischemia. Two sets of optodes were placed on the forehead (cerebral SO 2 -cSO 2 ), one on the abdomen, 2 cm left to umbilicus (mesenteric SO 2 -mSO 2 ), and one on the back lumbally, 3 cm from the midline (kidney SO 2 -kSO 2 ). SO 2 was measured in the acute phase of necrotizing enterocolitis and in the reconvalescent phase. Relative values of cSO 2 and mSO 2 were expressed as cerebro-mesenteric oxygenation ratio (CMOR). Readings were compared to recordings of a healthy newborn. Results: Mean mSO 2 values in the two patients with CHD were lower in the acute phase of necrotizing enterocolitis in comparison to values in the reconvalescent phase. Mean mSO 2 values in both phases were lower in comparison to values in a healthy term newborn. Mean CMOR in two newborns with CHD were higher in the acute phase of necrotizing enterocolitis in comparison to values in the reconvalescent phase and in a healthy newborn. Conclusions: NIRS may be used for monitoring mesenteric perfusion in newborns with CHD and low cardiac output but further studies are needed to establish the value of our results. Background and aims: One of the major concerns in patients at high risk of bleeding is to detect it and optimize hemoglobin (Hb), leading to repeated blood tests. Our objective is to describe our experience with a new method of a noninvasive continuous measurement of Hb concentration in these patients. Methods: Prospective observational study in children at risk of bleeding in a PICU, from January to December 2012. SpHb monitoring was performed continuously (Pulse Co-Oximeter Radical/ 7.8.0.1, Masimo Corp., Irvine, CA). When each blood sample was taken, we collected the data from Radical-7, using the automated Hb measurement in the laboratory as a reference method (SiemensAD-VIA2120i).

Backgrounds and aims: Serum creatinine is a delayed marker for acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery. Rapidly detectable AKI biomarkers could allow early intervention and improve outcomes. We investigated the temporal pattern and predictive value of urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL), for early identification of AKI in children undergoing cardiac surgery. Methods: Prospective observational cohort study involving 106 children undergoing surgery for congenital cardiac lesions. Urine samples were obtained before and at intervals postoperatively. AKI was defined according to pediatric RIFLE criteria. The temporal patterns of both uNGAL absolute concentration and the normalized to urine creatinine concentration (uNGAL/cr) were correlated with the development of AKI and other clinical outcomes. We evaluated the predictive ability of uNGAL and of uNGAL/cr by area under the curve (AUC), when added to an AKI clinical predictive model. Results: AKI occurred in 42 patients (39.6 %). uNGAL significantly increased in AKI patients at 1 h, 3 h and 15 h postoperatively. Optimal cutoff for uNGAL at 1 h was 100 ng/ml. uNGAL and uNGAL/cr correlated with surgical variables and clinical outcomes. AKI prediction improved when uNGAL was added to a clinical model (AUC increased at 1 h from 0.85 to 0.91, at 3 h to 0.92). uNGAL and uNGAL/cr values were not significantly different between patients with prerenal and sustained AKI. Conclusions: uNGAL is a predictive biomarker for AKI after pediatric cardiac surgery and may permit earlier intervention improving outcome of AKI. uNGAL normalized to urine creatinine improves the prediction of AKI severity, but offers no advantage in AKI diagnosis. Objective: To evaluate the effect of high altitude on the cardiopulmonary transition immediately birth. Methods: The arterial oxygen saturation were recorded by Pulse oximetry immediately after birth and continuously until the time at which the upper and lower limp saturation were equal. Data were compared with similar work done at sea. Results: At altitude of 1,640 m the mean SpO 2 in right hand was 68 % and in the right foot the mean SpO 2 was 60 % immediately after birth. SpO 2 values reached equality point after 20 min (8-45 min). Data was compared with similar studies done at sea level which was found to be significantly delayed at high altitude. Conclusion: At high altitude neonatal cardiopulmonary transition is significantly delayed compared with sea level. A lower preductal and postductal oxygen saturation cut-off levels than those used at sea level should be adopted when dealing with neonates born at high altitude. Interventions: Arterial and central venous blood samples were collected as needed. Patients clinical and laboratory data were collected at the time of each data collection. Results: A total of 369 data collection set collected from 120 patients, age 9.6 \u00b1 15.9 months, weight 5.7 \u00b1 3.6 kg. Upper body CV saturation was lower than lower body CV saturation 64.0 \u00b1 11.8 vs. 71 Introduction: Vascular access in pediatric age group is a challenging procedure especially in compromised children and those who require multiple vascular cannulations. We reported our experience in vascular access under ultrasound guidance in children with congenital heart disease and we discussed the technique of line insertion and its difficulties in small infants. Methods: In pediatric cardiac intensive care unit we enrolled prospectively all trials of vascular access guided by ultrasound from January 2010 till September 2010. Age, weight, the time from first needle puncture to wire insertion, site of insertion, number of attempts, type of the line and complications were documented. Results: 77 vascular access trials were performed in 43 patients. They included 15 arterial and 62 venous cannulations. Mean age and weight of patients were 15 months (6 days-11 years, median 2.5 months) and 7.2 kg (2-46 kg, median 3.8) respectively. Success rates were 93 and 95 % for arterial and venous cannulation respectively. Mean time from first needle puncture to wire insertion was 3.9 min (0.5-15 min, median 2 min). 55 central lines cannulation (75 %) were successful from the first puncture, 17 (23 %) were successful from the second puncture and one case (2 %) required 3 punctures. Lower body weight did not affect success rate as 30 patients (45 %) were \\3.5 kg with 96.6 % success cannulation rate. There were no associated complications. Conclusion: Ultrasound guided vascular cannulation in critically ill pediatric patients is very useful. It is associated with high success rate and minimal complications. Pediatric Intensive Care, 2 Pediatric Surgery, University Children's Hospital, 3 Internal Diseases, Riga Stradins University Hospital, Riga, Latvia Introduction: Cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is commonly perceived as a risk factor for decline in renal function. Hypothermia, hypoxia, hypotension, non-pulsatile blood flow during CPB, use of ACE inhibitors, inotropic and (or) vasoactive support affects kidney and contributes to the acute kidney injury (AKI). Objective: To evaluate the incidence and outcome of AKI in children with congenital heart disease (CHD). Methods: We enrolled 30 patients, 12 boys and 18 girls with CHD. Their median body weight was 6.8 kg, and median age 7 months. SCr was determined and preoperative and postoperative creatinine clearance (ClCr) was estimated using Schwarz formula (eClCr). Urine was collected to measure ClCr, using the difference in urine (UCr) and SCr concentrations (mClCr). Urine output, body temperature, duration of aortic cross clamping and cardiopulmonary bypass was recorded. Background and aims: Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants is associated with numerous morbidities and increased mortality. Treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors and/or surgical ligation has failed to show major improvements in short term or long term outcomes. Our objective was to document PDA course in a cohort of patients managed conservatively, with a high threshold for medical or surgical treatment using the addition of regular functional echocardiography. Methods: This was a retrospective chart review between January 2011 and December 2011 in Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital. Functional echocardiography was introduced as a standard investigation for all neonates born below 1,500 g within the first week of life, commencing in January 2011. Further reviews were done according to the PDA significance. Results: One hundred and thirty-nine infants with birth weight below 1,500 g were admitted during the study period. Two infants with congenital abnormalities were excluded. Eighty-eight infants (64 %) were diagnosed with PDA and 11 patients (8 %) had a PDA at discharge from the hospital. We performed 387 functional echocardiography investigations. Only one patient required surgical ligation (0.7 %) and four patients were treated with Ibuprofen (3 %). Ten patients (7 %) did not survive to discharge. Seventeen (12 %) had chronic lung disease, four (3 %) developed surgical necrotising enterocolitis, five (4 %) had severe peri/intraventricular haemorrhage or cystic periventricular leukomalacia. These results compare favourably to the Vermont-Oxford database with a significant reduction in PDA treatment. Conclusions: A conservative approach to PDA treatment is a feasible option, reducing PDA treatment while using functional echocardiography. Backgrounds and aims: Non invasive pressure recording analytical method (PRAM) for measuring cardiac index (CI) has recently appeared. The aim of this study is to compare PRAM with femoral artery thermodilution (FATD) in a pediatric animal model of hypoxia. Methods: Thirty five mechanically ventilated piglets with a median (inter-quartile) weight of 9 (8.5-10.8) kg were studied. Femoral artery and vein were canalized under sedation. CI was measured simultaneously using PRAM and FATD, after calibration with two infusions of 5 ml-cold saline (\\8\u00b0C). Measurements were repeated before and 5 min after ventilator withdrawal to induce asphyxia. Results: Thirty two paired measurements were compared. The mean (SD) CI was 4.27 (1.54) L min -1 with FATD as opposed to 4.10 (1.59) L min -1 using PRAM. The mean bias was -8.3 % (95 % Limits of agreement 118.6 to -135.2 %) with a percentage error of 104 %. Before ventilator withdrawal (24 paired measurements), the CI was 4.04 (0.94) L min -1 with FATD and 4.46 (1.42) L min -1 using PRAM. The mean bias in this case was -15.2 % (67.4 to -97.7 %) with a percentage error of 82 %. After ventilator withdrawal (8 paired measurements), the CI was 4.97 (2.62) L min -1 with FATD and 3.04 (1.66) L min -1 using PRAM. The mean bias was 12.3 % (227.7 to -203.2 %) with a percentage error of 117 %. Conclusions: In this experimental infant animal model, poor agreement existed between PRAM and FATD CI measurements. Background: Determining optimum timing for surgical repair in congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is challenging. Pulmonary hypertension (PAH) is a determinant of disease severity in CDH, and leads to secondary right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. This study investigated patterns of RV dysfunction in CDH before and after surgery, using Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 122, "end": 131, "text": "(4.4-18.5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 251, "end": 266, "text": "1.5 (0.93-3.32)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3791, "end": 3793, "text": "71", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5495, "end": 5496, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "-POSTER SESSION"}, {"text": "Method: In 20 infants with CDH, TDI RV E 0 velocities were measured to assess RV diastolic function, on paired days in the first week of life and post-op period. Infants were grouped by disease severity according to duration of respiratory support: DRS \\ 25 and DRS [25 days. Results: In infants with more severe disease (DRS \\ 25) RV E 0 was significantly lower in the first week of life, except day 3-4 ( Figure 1 ). After surgery RV E 0 deteriorated and was significantly lower in the DRS [25 group on day 3-4 post op ( Figure 2 ). Conclusions: RV diastolic dysfunction identifies infants with severe CDH. Delaying surgery until day 3-4 allows improvement of RV function prior to post-operative deterioration. Introduction: Advanced simulation facilitates the training on the management of complex life support procedures without risks to patients. Until now, the only way to train the management of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVHF) was the direct learning on real patients. Our objective was to create a simulator of CVVHF that could be integrated with current advanced simulators to permit the repetitive and effective training of providers and improve patient safety. Methods: A device to simulate CVVHF related clinical conditions was invented. It permits the control ''on the fly'' of all the pressures measured by the CVVHF monitor, separately or in combination. The instructor simultaneously could manipulate the CVVHF and the patient simulator. Specific scenarios were designed. Results: 80 participants in 4 courses on renal replacement therapies were included (RRT). Lectures, workshops, skillstations, animal laboratory (rabbits and pigs) and high-fidelity simulation (Simbaby \u00d2 ) scenarios were included. 32 scenarios that generated usual conditions and complications related to the therapy with CVVHF, were carried out. Our device permitted the change of the CVVHF monitor pressures in real time according to clinical situation and participants' actions. No device failures were observed and no scenario needed to be halted. Participants considered our device a useful training tool. Scenarios reproduced correctly clinical conditions. Discussion: CVVHF control simulator allows a realistic generation of RRT scenarios. It permits abrupt or progressive, individual or combined, circuit pressure changes, giving to the instructor a total control of the scenario. This device could be integrated in the software of these simulators. Background and aims: The Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder with a very heterogeneous clinical picture, comprising a congenital heart defect (CHD) in 50-80 % of affected individuals. The phenotype diversity is a consequence of nine different genes (PTPN11, SOS1, KRAS, RAS, RAF1, BRAF, SHOC2, MEK1, CBL) involved in the pathogenesis of NS. The most common CHD are pulmonary valve stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), which is present in about 20 % of NS patients. The rapidly progressive HCM, resulting in early death or need for heart transplantation, occurs only sporadically in NS. Methods: A DNA genotyping of a NS patient with rapidly progressive HCM and lethal exitus at the age of 4 months due to a cardiorespiratory failure was performed. Results: A heterozygous unclassified missense variant in exon 3: c.179G [ T (p.Gly60Val) was detected in the KRAS gene.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 407, "end": 415, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 523, "end": 531, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF19"}], "section": "-POSTER SESSION"}, {"text": "The KRAS mutation is a rare cause of NS with a usually mild clinical course and an infrequent association with CHD.

Background and aims: Treatment options for the closure of a haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA) include medical therapy such as ibuprofen and indomethacin and surgical ligation.

On echocardiographic examination, median internal ductal diameter was 2 mm (1.5-3) , with a median left atrium-to-aortic root ratio of 1.95 (1.6-2.2). Intravenous paracetamol resulted in successful closure of hsPDA in all patients. Conclusions: This study is the first case series in the literature, which is used intravenous paracetamol treatment of hsPDA. We believe that intravenous paracetamol could be used as an alternative drug for infants. Further prospective randomized-controlled trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous paracetamol for the closure of hsPDA. Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, 2 Research Support Unit, Hospital Infantil Virgen del Rocio, Seville, Spain Objective: Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO 2 ) is a measure of the general state of perfusion and oxygenation. We aim to analyze the relationship between this and various hemodynamic and respiratory parameters. Patients and methods: Forty-three patients, operated on between October 2011 and July 2012, were included in this prospective observational descriptive study. The following parameters were measured: mean arterial pressure, both arterial and central venous oxygen saturation and partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide, and lactate levels. From these parameters, the oxygenation index and the oxygen extraction ratio were calculated. These measurements were studied to evaluate whether rSO 2 correlated significantly with the other parameters. Results: The average age and weight of the patients were 27.3 months and 9.2 kg respectively. The rSO 2 correlated positively with both central venous oxygen saturation (r = 0.73, p \\ 0.01) and mean arterial pressure (r = 0.59, p \\ 0.01), and negatively with the oxygen extraction ratio (r = -0.7, p \\ 0.01). No correlation was found with the respiratory parameters. Concordance analysis established an acceptable Kappa index ([0.4) between the rSO 2 and central venous oxygen saturation, and between the rSO 2 and oxygen extraction ratio. Conclusion: Regional cerebral oxygen saturation correlates well with hemodynamic parameters-mean arterial pressure, venous saturation, and the tissue oxygen extraction. However, it does not correlate with respiratory parameters.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 343, "end": 350, "text": "(1.5-3)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2157, "end": 2163, "text": "([0.4)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "-POSTER SESSION"}, {"text": "VOCAL CORD PALSY FOLLOWING AORTIC ARCH SURGERY: INCIDENCE, DIAGNOSIS AND IMPLICATIONS", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "-POSTER SESSION"}, {"text": "Bristol Children's Hospital, Bristol, UK Vocal cord paralysis is a known entity often described as a complication of neck surgery, mainly thyroidectomy. A less frequent site of injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve is the chest during cardiac surgery, particularly involving the aortic arch. Recurrent laryngeal injury after cardiac surgery is often overlooked as a cause of postoperative respiratory insufficiency or hoarseness. The true incidence of vocal cord dysfunction may be hard to draw in case of lack of a routine post-operative laryngeal examination for patients with dysphonia. In the paediatric population it significantly affects feeding, with many babies requiring NG feeds and prolonged hospital admission. Patients with unilateral vocal cord paralysis present with respiratory insufficiency, stridor and obstructive symptoms. The reported incidence of vocal cord palsy following cardiac surgery via median sternotomy ranges between 1.7 and 67 % depending on the type of surgery and the weight of the infant at the time of surgery. We conducted an audit of aortic arch surgery, looking at incidence of vocal cord palsy, its detection and outcome. Analysing 115 aortic arch surgeries we found our local rate was 19 %, most of these detected during inpatient admission. Some cases however were diagnosed following discharge. Most cases had symptoms of stridor or respiratory distress. However, cases missed were described only as poor feeders. This raises the possibility of screening all cases of aortic arch surgery in paediatric patients with elective laryngoscopy. Background: Ultrasound (US) guidance is becoming the standard technique for central venipuncture in neonates, infants and children. Though much of the initial experience in this field has been carried out with internal jugular vein (IJV) and subclavian vein (SV), in neonates and in small children the largest vein to access may be the brachio-cephalic vein (BCV), which can be easily visualized in the superior mediastinum and punctured 'in-plane' by US guidance. Methods: We have reviewed all US guided insertions of central venous catheters (CVC) performed in neonates and in children \\6 years in our Pediatric Intensive Care Unit and in our Pediatric Oncology Department. PICCs were excluded from the analysis. The vein to puncture was chosen after US evaluation. Kits for microintroduction (21 G needles, soft straight tip 0.018 guide-wire, 3-4 Fr micro-introducer-dilator) were used in all patients. Results: In 165 patients (age: 15 \\ 1 month, 70 1-12 months, 80 1-6 years), we inserted 183 CVC: in 167 cases, after US examination of all possible vein approaches, we esteemed that BCV was the largest and easiest vein to access. All insertions were successful, with no punctured-related complications (no pneumothorax, no accidental arterial punctures). In most cases (95 %), the BCV was punctured at first pass of the needle. Conclusion: In the vast majority of patients \\6 years, the BCV is the vein with the largest caliber and the easiest and the safest for US guided venipuncture. Background and aims: In healthy term neonates, pulmonary pressures fall rapidly following birth and first breaths. However in the extremely low birth weight (ELBW; below 1,000 g) infants, there is very little information about the pattern of this physiological adaptation. The aim of our study was to prospectively measure pulmonary pressures following delivery. Methods: All ELBW infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit in the Coombe Women and Infants University hospital were eligible for enrolment. Targeted echocardiography was performed at three, six and 12 h of age to measure the size and flow pattern in the PDA and the tricuspid regurgitation (TR) in m/sec as an indirect assessment of pulmonary hypertension (PH).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "C.

Mean TR at 3 h of age was 1.6 m/s, falling to 1.2 m/s at 12 h of age (p = 0.15). Five infants had TR above 2 m/s (estimated pulmonary pressure above 20 mm Hg) after 3 h of age, suggestive of delayed transition. Conclusions: PH with impaired transition could play a role in stabilisation of extremely preterm neonates. Further data are needed to confirm this finding with possible targeted approach to infants with delayed transition. Objectives: Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is a proven, beneficial therapy amongst neonatal, paediatric and adult patients. Being able to offer a mobile ECMO (mECMO) service across the United Kingdom allows greater and earlier access to this life saving therapy. Our aim is to review our experience of this unique service. Methods: Between January 2009-December 2012, all patients accepted for mECMO support in whom conventional transfer was deemed too high risk, were enrolled. Demographic data, diagnosis, adverse events, clinical details, transport times and outcome were analysed.

Statistical analyses were performed using Chi square test, multiple Poisson regression with robust variance, and analysis of variance with repeated measures. Results: By the first interview, suggestive scores of PTSD were present in 42.3 % of NICUg and 8.3 % of WBNg (p \\ 0.01). By the second interview, PTSD was present in 38.4 and 6.2 %, respectively, and NICUg showed a score 1.53 points higher than mothers of WBNg (p = 0.04). Moreover, NICUg had lower education level (p \\ 0.05) and prevalence of PTSD was higher in mothers of infants more ill and with higher gestational age. Conclusions: PTSD had higher incidence at NICUg, though also present at the WBNg and both groups showed no significant symptoms improvement after 6-8 weeks time. It is important to investigate this disorder in all postpartum women in a way the proper treatment could be offered to them preventing suffer and negative impact at the infant's development. Introduction and aims: It remains controversial whether adolescent pregnancy is associated with adverse events such as premature delivery and neonatal mortality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the profile of newborns' death in a neonatal unit of a tertiary hospital and its relation to maternal age and other covariates and associated factors. Methods: Retrospective descriptive study conducted in the neonatal unit of a tertiary hospital evaluated all births and deaths of neonates in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), verifying the relationship among the occurrence of death and clinical and demographic variables. Statistical analysis was run using ANOVA, Two-way ANOVA, post hoc by Sidak, and Bivariate Correlation of Spearman two-tail. Results: We analyzed data from 4,827 births (755 in teenage mother's group and 4,072 in adult mother's group) at the database of the Department of Neonatology, referring to attended population from 2000 to 2007. The mortality rate was 1.1 % (57 neonates). Neonates' death was related with lower: gestational age, Apgar scores and birth weight and was highly associated with teenager's pregnancy (t = 2.5, p \\ 0.05), health care-associated infections (p = 0.003) and hemorrhagic disorder (p = 0.03). Teenager mothers had babies with lower birth weights, lower Apgar score at 5 min, more vaginal delivery and fewer regular antenatal visits. Conclusions: Teenagers' newborns had higher tendency to lower birth weight, lower score of Apgar in the fifth minute and higher mortality. Data suggests preventive awareness campaigns and intensive follow up of teenage pregnancy by health professionals. 1) To ascertain prevalence of symptoms of burnout in a mixed staff group working in a paediatric intensive care setting. 2) To examine associations between symptoms of burnout, demographic factors, resilience and stress. 3) To determine whether the use of particular coping strategies was associated with lower risk of burnout.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results:"}, {"text": "Design: Cross-sectional questionnaire study Participants: Fifty-eight health professionals working on a Paediatric/Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "-POSTER SESSION"}, {"text": "Measures: Abbreviated Maslach Burnout Inventory (aMBI) which is made up of 3 subscales, Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalisation and Personal Achievement, each scored 0 = never to 18 = everyday; Brief Resiliency Scale (BRS); Trauma Screening Questionnaire (TSQ); list of coping strategies. Results: All staff admitted to symptoms of Emotional Exhaustion on some level, mean score = 8.0; 22 experienced some Depersonalisation, mean score = 2.6 and scores for Personal Achievement ranged from 2 to 18, mean score = 12.5, although there was no association with gender, length of service, living alone, having children or profession (doctor/nurse).

Objectives: Admissions to paediatric intensive care (PIC) appear to be increasing in England and Wales (E&W). We aimed to identify whether this increase was due to an increasing need for PIC or changing population demographics. Methods: Anonymised data from the Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network (PICANet) was analysed for all PIC admissions to NHS Trusts in E&W between 2004 and 2011 including sex, age, diagnostic group, mode of ventilation and deaths. This was compared with 2011 census data and live birth rates over the same period from the Office of National Statistics. Results: The number of patients admitted to PIC in E&W increased by 27 % between 2004 and 2011. The most significant increase was in children under 5 years of age (34 %). Over the same period there was a 13.2 % increase in live births with a mean annual increase of 2 % over the past 10 years. The number of individual children with respiratory admission diagnoses has risen most (39 %) with increasing numbers receiving ventilatory support during the study period (42 %). Additionally more patients each year have multiple PIC admissions, particularly those with cardiac and respiratory diagnoses. The male preponderance of patients overall remained unchanged (M:F ratio 1:2). There was also a 10 % decrease in the number of deaths over the 8 years. Conclusions: Demand for PIC beds in England and Wales is increasing with an expanding younger patient population, particularly those with respiratory diagnoses requiring ventilation, significantly affecting admission rates. Awareness of these demographic trends is necessary to optimise available PIC resources. Objectives: There are substantial challenges to conducting randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in pediatric critical care. Pilot RCTs can be used to evaluate the feasibility of, and inform the design and conduct of, larger RCTs. Our objective was to systematically identify and describe pilot RCTs in pediatric critical care. Methods: We searched the Evidence in Pediatric Intensive Care database (epicc.mcmaster.ca) for published trials (1986 to July 1, 2012) that were described by the authors as pilot, feasibility, proof-ofconcept, phase 2 or preliminary studies. We then used Web of Science \u00d2 and the World Health Organization's Clinical Trials Search Portal to search for trials informed by these pilot trials. Results: We identified 20 pilot RCTs out of a total of 225 RCTs. The number of children randomized ranged from 6 to 56; the median number was smaller than non-pilot RCTs (26 vs. 50, p \\ 0.001). Three trials (15 %) explicitly reported feasibility as an outcome and none reported criteria for success. Blinding was reported in 9 RCTs (45 %). We found 3 registered trials (2 listed as recruiting and 1 as terminated) in trial registries that were similar to 4 pilot trials. 17 pilot trials were indexed in Web of Science; these were cited a median number of 15 (IQR 4-30) times in total and 2.7 (IQR 0.9-6.9) times per year since publication. With the recent introduction of a high-quality, reasonably priced, and completely portable neonatal ultrasound machines, a new paradigm shift also emerged in the philosophy of ultrasound imaging in PICU which is the philosophy of ''critical ultrasound''. This is a shift from being organ based, systematic, comprehensive exam done by radiologists to a new concept of problem based, goal directed, focused multi-organ, time dependent, exam done by the treating neonatologist. The new paradigm is not trying to describe an organ pathology but rather involves ''focused-simple yes/now'' exams for the airway, lung, heart, abdominal or limbs that directed to answer specific clinical problem (like hypoxia-hypotension\u2026.etc.) and performed not only for diagnosis but also for monitoring the management. The presentation will give the results of 4-years' experience of our center with regards to this new essential skill in PICU in obtaining hour-by-hour information to help the management of the critically ill pediatric cardiac patients, in addition to the multiple procedures that was guided by ultrasound such as vascular access, lumbar puncture or pleural tap. It will also shed light on its important application in the telemedicine filed.

The high cost extends almost to all aspects of PICU including the infrastructure, medications, imaging, monitoring, machines, devices in addition to the staffing costs. There are a many consequences and ramifications of this phenomenon particularly in limited resource countries. Among the important effects is the marked limitation of providing PICU care to many patients due to the high cost if there is an alternative low cost PICU, it would be feasible to provide PICU care a larger pool of patients. PICU drains great percentage of overall budget of any hospital. On a population based perspective, a state or country health care system can be severely affected with such high cost PICUs. The lecture will shed light on strategies for establishing low cost PICUs that can perform efficiently in managing critically ill patients. Through evidence based method, it will give several examples that clearly shown lack of benefits of utilization of high cost drugs, lab, ventilators, machines and other devices commonly used in PICU. It will explain strategies for managing patients outside PICU such as ''critical care outreach'' programs. Results: 6 studies were identified.

Objectives: To evaluate variations in prenatal counselling of obstetric physicians (OP) and paediatric physicians (PP) in predicting probability of primary postnatal surgical closure of an omphalocele. To establish which prenatal information guides that judgment. Methods: Cases with an isolated omphalocele or with minor additional anomalies and between 12 and 23 weeks of gestation were included. A standardized presentation form per case provided ultrasound images, defect diameter, cele content and 2 ratios: cele circumference/abdominal circumference and defect diameter/ abdominal diameter. Ten OP and nine PP assessed the probability of primary closure quantitatively and qualitatively and stated which information was most important for their assessment. The specialists were blinded towards patients and postnatal outcome. Results: Primary closure was observed in 13/21 cases, and predicted correctly by the majority of the specialists in 5/13 cases. The number of correct assessments per case ranged from 12 to 17/19. In the 8 cases not closed primarily, closure was predicted correctly in 7/8.

Critical cares for young children are usually provided in Paediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) by anaesthesiologists trained in adult anaesthesia residency programs. In Southern Italy, the shortage of PICU beds has led to an increased number of critically ill infants being admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs). Whilst many aspects of neonatal care resemble those of paediatric critical care medicine (PCCM), several disorders are unique to each respective discipline. To meet the needs of neonatologists to learn basic notions of PCCM, we devised a two-day course with four main handson sessions. The first session aims to provide the basic and advanced ABC resuscitation skills of the critically ill child, the second teaches how to manage lung failure with invasive and non-invasive ventilation strategies, while the third provides guidelines for hemodynamic support of paediatric septic shock, including a practical session on the ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization and radial arterial cannulation techniques; finally, the last session includes high fidelity simulation scenarios to practice non-technical skills. All course teachers are neonatologists with PCCM field experience. At the end of the course, participants performed an anonymous evaluation of all aspects of the course. The students found the course to be well suited to their training needs and indicated a high level of satisfaction (73 % of trainers marked the highest score for the acquisition of new theoretical knowledge, and 86 % for procedural skills). They suggest that the course should be available to all neonatologists dealing with critically ill young infants. Background: Diaper dermatitis (DD) represents a classical irritative contact dermatitis. It's prevalence is estimated between 25 and 65 % of children with a peak around 6-12 months of life. Zinc oxide is generally recommended as the best first choice for DD. Pure topical vitamin E has an emollient effect on the skin and the absence of water also prevents bacterial proliferation, enhancing the barrier function of the skin. Besides Vitamin E has been promoted to help wound healing. Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of vitamin E and zinc oxide in neonates affected by DD.

Staff members of the NICU play a crucial role in supporting parents during the first weeks of the infant's life. The work of the Neonatal Intensive Care staff involves close interaction with parents and infant during a most vulnerable time. The formation of the bond between mother and infant is underway and through their interactions with parents and with infants this process may be facilitated and supported. Staff may also encounter emotionally distressing situations on a daily basis. This may lead to stress and secondary trauma. This complex interplay of factors relating to the developing attachment between infant and parent in the setting of the NICU has important implications for the infant, parents and for staff. Our objectives were to identify NICU staff attitudes to and perceptions of attachment and social-emotional development of infants admitted to a tertiary referral NICU at a teaching hospital, to enquire about previous education and training in this area and to explore staff perceptions of the emotional impact of the work on staff. Methodology: The study is an observational study. A questionnaire was administered to staff of the NICU and results analysed using SurveyMonkey tm. Results: The most frequent contact with parents was discussing the infant's medical condition. The least frequent contacts were psychological support, assessment of parent's emotional state and social support. Staff believed that discussing parent's emotional states was part of their role and these states affected infant development and infantparent relationship, but staff had received little training in the area.

We retrieved prenatal and postnatal data, and images of the axial plane of the abdomen at the level of the defect. Two potential prognostic ratios were calculated which reflect the viscero abdominal disproportion: the defect diameter/abdominal diameter (DD/DA) ratio, and the omphalocele circumference/abdominal circumference (OC/AC) ratio. Prognostic outcome was primary closure. The sensitivity and specificity of these ratios, and the area under the ROC curve were calculated as measures of prognostic accuracy. Results: Primary closure was performed in 8/13 cases. A cut-off value of 0.61 for the DD/DA-ratio successfully predicted type of closure in 10/13 cases; for the OC/AC-ratio a cut-off value of 0.82 successfully predicted outcome in 12/13 cases. In all cases without eviscerated liver tissue, the defect was primarily closed. Conclusion: Particularly the OC/AC-ratio represents an accurate counseling tool to inform parents in case of an omphalocele detected in the second trimester of pregnancy.

Objectives: Embrace, the Yorkshire and Humber Infant and Children's Transport Service, performed 2,236 transfers in the year 2011/12. Embrace is collaborating with aeromedical providers to enable access to air transport for their patients. Process improvement tools and techniques have been shown to improve operational efficiency and effectiveness in health services.

The daily activity of the transport service was overlaid with local emergency medical helicopter availability in a simulation study to further understand utilisation. A scenario was also considered where a dedicated helicopter was utilised and other restrictions were lifted. Results: Database analysis showed the potential for Embrace to transfer patients by helicopter was around 50 occasions per year. After reviewing the cases, this was reduced to 38 occasions per year. The simulation study demonstrated 47 opportunities for Embrace to transfer patients by helicopter. However for 29 of these transports a helicopter could not be accessed.

PICU readmission was associated with prolonged length of stay. Preterm infants are exposed to loud noises during their stay in the neonatal intensive care unit which can lead to physiologic and behavioral alterations and even hearing loss. The use of earmuffs can reduce sound level and these changes. To evaluate the effectiveness of the earmuffs in preterm infants solely cared for in closed incubators, a comparative prospective study comprising 20 clinically stable preterm infants weighing \\1,500 g was conducted. Preterm infants acted as their own controls whereby they were observed without earmuffs (Group 1) for 2 days and with earmuffs (Group 2) on consecutive 2 days. The preterm infants' physiologic responses and Anderson Behavioral State Scoring System (ABSS) scores were assessed over 30 s every 2 h for 8 h during daytime for 4 days. Out of 20 preterm infants, 6 were male and 14 female with a mean birth weight of 1,220 \u00b1 209 g, gestational age of 29.9 \u00b1 2.1 weeks. The total number of measurements was 320. The mean ABSS scores of Group 1 and 2 were 3.07 \u00b1 1.1 and 1.34 \u00b1 0.3, respectively. Statistically significant difference was noted between the means of ABSS scores (p \\ 0.001). Preterm infants with earmuffs (87.5 %) were more frequently observed in a quiet sleep state of ABSS compared with those without earmuffs (29.4 %). In conclusion, noise reduction in preterm infants by earmuffs may be helpful by improving sleep efficiency and increasing time of quiet sleep.

Background and aims: Family-centred care is an expected standard in PICU and parent reported outcomes are rarely measured. The Dutch validated EMPATHIC questionnaire provides accurate measures of parental perceptions of family-centred care in PICU. A French version would provide an important resource for quality control and benchmarking with other PICUs. The study aimed to translate and to assess the French cultural adaptation of the EMPATHIC questionnaire. Methods: In September 2012, following approval from the developer, translation and cultural adaptation were performed using a structured method (Wild et al. 2005) . This included forward-backward translation and reconciliation by an official translator, harmonization assessed by the research team, and cognitive debriefing with the target users' population. In this last step, a convenience sample of parents with PICU experience assessed the comprehensibility and cultural relevance of the 65-item French EMPATHIC questionnaire. The PI-CUs in Lausanne, Switzerland and Lille, France participated. Results: Seventeen parents, including 13 French native and 4 French as second language speakers, tested the cognitive equivalence and cultural relevance of the French EMPATHIC questionnaire. The mean agreement for comprehensibility of all 65 items reached 90.2 %. Three items fell below the cut-off 80 % agreement and were revised for inclusion in the final French version. Conclusions: The translation and the cultural adaptation permitted to highlight a few cultural differences that did not interfere with the main construct of the EMPATHIC questionnaire. Reliability and validity testing with a new sample of parents is needed to strengthen the psychometric properties of the French EMPATHIC questionnaire. The aim was to evaluate possible changes in temperature, heart &breath rate, breastfeeding, sleeping rate, and attachment of mother and infant A randomized controlled trial was performed in which 60 LBW neonates with weight B2 kg. Subjects were matched by sex, gestational age, mother's delivery type, Apgar score, mother's education, age, occupations. The subjects were randomized into three equal groups, one intervention group (KMC-20) received KMC in hospital, the other (KMC-20) received KMC at home. The control group (CMC-20) received conventional care. KMC groups received kmc for 6 h per day in 6 consecutive days and control group received standard care. The results showed breathing rate, Heart rate, temperature and Sleeping time in study groups had significant differences (p \\ 0.001) and the mean of the study groups were more than control group, Also the result showed nutrition rate in study groups had significant statistical differences after applying KMC (p \\ 0.001) and in relation to mother and infant attachment, comparing these three groups showed significant differences (p \\ 0.05) and the Levene Statistic test showed that the variance of three groups are equal (F(2,57) = 1.67, p [ 0.05), and an ANOVA test showed there are significant differences between three groups. KMC at home results are significantly increased in neonates when they are given KMC at home. The present study has important implications in the care of LBW in developing countries, where expensive facilities for conventional care may not be available and where a neonate is kept in the hospital just because he or she is a LBW. Background and aims: The pediatric intensive care unit (28-beds, level 3 IC unit with 1,400 admissions annually) in the Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital Rotterdam runs a Patient Safety Management System since 2004. It includes incident reporting, adverse event detection, team training and risk management. To justify our activities we needed to quantify the effects on patient outcome in terms of occurence of adverse events. Adverse events (AE's) are reported voluntary in two ways; complication registration by physicians and digital incident reporting mainly by nurses. We assume that there is underreporting of AE's. Methods: AE's can be detected and monitored with the trigger tool methodology. A trigger is an occurence, prompt or flag found on review of a medical record that 'triggers' further investigation into the possibility of an AE. In our PICU we used the PICU trigger tool from the Institute of Healthcare Improvement and some items from their NICU trigger tool. Consensus was reached about definitions, how to identify a trigger and how to determine the occurence of an AE. We applied the trigger tool on medical records, the hospital electronic database and the unit data management system. Results: Application of the trigger tool on a random sample of 25 % of all patients discharged in 2011 yielded 249 AE's in 106 patients (32.5 %). In 2012 we considered all discharged patients in the first 6 months. We identified 456 AE's in 216 patients (23.6 %). Conclusions: We detected far more AE's with the trigger tool than reported by physicians using complication registration only.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 777, "end": 795, "text": "(Wild et al. 2005)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "A.

The report, Major Complications of Airway Management in the UK, has recommended the immediate availability of a DAT in intensive care units. We surveyed current practice in UK Paediatric Intensive Care Units (PICU) and high-dependency units (HDU) regarding availability of a DAT to highlight the need. Methods: We identified 31 PICU and HDUs. A telephone survey was conducted and questions identified the presence of a DAT, its contents, location and on-going management. Data was analysed using Excel. Results: We achieved a 100 % response rate. 42 % (13 units) had a paediatric DAT. 58 % (18 units) did not. Standard airway equipment was similar. Additional visualisation aids were the Glidescope and Airtraq. 3 units had a fiberoptic bronchoscope. 23 % of units had Quicktrach sets and 46 % cricothyrotomy needle kits. Discussion: Unanticipated difficult airway in the paediatric population is uncommon and this may be why less than half of the PICU (42 %) have a DAT. We agree with the recommendation that a dedicated paediatric DAT in PICU is essential for the provision of high quality care [2] . Background and purpose: 40 % of all initial infections with Toxoplasma gondii during pregnancy develop into connatal toxoplasmosis, which is associated with the risk of severe damage to the CNS, frequent premature deliveries, and stillbirths. In Germany, toxoplasmosis immunity screenings are not covered by the state health insurance as a general preventive care service, in contrast to screening for rubella immunity. Therefore, we analyzed the impact of socioeconomic factors on the efficiency of private toxoplasmosis screening during pregnancy in a population-based study. Materials and methods: Toxoplasmosis and rubella screening data were collected from 5,736 mothers during the period from May 2002 to June 2008 within the population-based Survey of Neonates in Pomerania (SNiP). Results: At the first screening, 34.2 % of expecting mothers were immune to toxoplasmosis, 75.2 % had immunity against rubella after active immunization. Negative immunity for toxoplasmosis was found in 39.7 % and in 7.7 % for rubella (missing information: toxoplasmosis: 25.8 %; rubella 17.2 %). Less than 10 % (n = 282) of the women without immunity participated in a second toxoplasmosis screening. An active toxoplasmosis infection was found in 0.3 % (n = 17) women during pregnancy. There were no infections with the rubella virus. Pregnant women with a higher socioeconomic status participated in screenings considerably more frequently. Conclusion: Our population-based sample demonstrated a substantial risk of toxoplasmosis infection during pregnancy in contrast to the rubella risk. Furthermore, lower socioeconomic status adversely affects the rate of toxoplasmosis screening. This data support the need for toxoplasmosis screening for pregnant women as a general health care benefit covered by insurance.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 127, "end": 128, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 371, "end": 374, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 375, "end": 377, "text": "2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1477, "end": 1480, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "-POSTER SESSION NATIONWIDE SURVEY OF DIFFICULT AIRWAY TROLLEYS IN PAEDIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE"}, {"text": "Objective: To evaluate the benefits of lycopene supplementation in prevention of pre-eclampsia and the perinatal outcome in women at high risk of developing pre-eclampsia.

Objectives: Healthcare-associated infections (HAI) are a major and potentially preventable cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in the acute care setting. The main objective of this study is the implementation of a deviceassociated infections surveillance system, including central line-, urinary tract catheter-and endotracheal tube-associated infections, in a French neonatal and paediatric intensive care unit. Methods: All children consecutively admitted to our unit, from July to December 2011, for more than 48 h, were prospectively included. The data were separately analyzed for the neonatal (1-28 days old) and the paediatric population ([28 days old). All above mentioned devices were registered. The definitions used for HAI were those elaborated by the Center for Diseases Control. All data were treated anonymously. A linear regression analysis was performed to point out the main risk factors of HAI. Results: We assessed 303 consecutive admissions. Of them, 181 children were included in the surveillance: 129 neonates (median weight: 1,730 g; median gestational age: 32 weeks), wearing 199 central lines, 116 endotracheal tubes and 26 urinary tract catheters. Seventeen central line-associated bloodstream infections and 5 endotracheal tube associated infections were found. Fifty two children (median age: 3 months) having had 31 central lines, 23 endotracheal tubes and 14 urinary tract catheters were also enrolled. Conclusions: The implementation of a HAI surveillance system is feasible. An additional surveillance period is planned to allow the analysis of the device-associated infections incidence rates. This surveillance system will help us to improve our healthcare practices. Objectives: To assess the safety and fiscal implications of using High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) therapy in a paediatric ward (PW) for treating infants with bronchiolitis. Methods: 61 infants aged B12 months with bronchiolitis and oxygen requirement were enrolled in the emergency department (ED) and transferred to the PW on HFNC. Comparison group of 33 patients retrospectively identified, but managed with standard sub nasal oxygen therapy. Results: Admission demographics and heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and physiological score (CEWT) were similar in both groups. Patients requiring PICU admission showed no change of HR, RR and CEWT after 1 h on HFNC compared to a significant decrease in the patients remaining on PW (p \\ 0.02). Patients receiving HFNC were 4 times less likely to need PICU admission than the comparison group (OR 4.086, p = 0.043). There were no serious adverse events or intubations. Median length of stay of both groups was 92 h. Current costs for a combined PICU/PW admission are AU$ 15,517/pp, compared to AU$ 4,992/pp on PW alone. Predicted annual cost saving for a 19 bed mixed medical/surgical PICU with 1,300 admissions/year is AU$ 1.2 Mio. Conclusions: HFNC treatment on the PW for bronchiolitis is safe. Non-responders requiring PICU admission can be identified by no S68 Intensive Care Med (2013) 39 (Suppl 1):S1-S200 reduction in HR, RR and CEWT within the first hour of HFNC treatment. The early use of HFNC in ED may lead to a significant decrease in the admission of infants with bronchiolitis to the PICU and hence represent significant health care cost savings. Introduction: Prescribing errors are a major problem in the healthcare environment with paediatrics presenting challenges from offlabel and weight based prescribing. In the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) additional factors such as the severity of illness and the involvement of multiple specialist teams may predispose to greater numbers of errors. Aims: The aims of this audit were to assess the level of adherence to hospital prescribing guidelines in the PICU, identifying the areas of greatest and least adherence, and trying to identify possible patient factors that may predispose to a higher incidence of non-adherence. Methodology: A prospective, observational audit was carried out in the PICU in Alder Hey Children's Hospital with bedside data collection, using a template based on hospital guidelines.

A review of the steps taken in order to implement, extend and develop this database was done after 2 years. Results: In 2010 the database comprised 673 preterm infants, born in 9 maternity hospitals and covered 14.28 % from all the births in Romania. In 2011, the database increased to 1309 preterm infants admitted in 15 neonatal units (13 level III and regional and 2 level II maternities), covering 23.41 % of the births at national level. Also, in 2011, the database was enlarged to collect, above epidemiological data and information regarding birth management and respiratory care, data about nutrition and infections. Also, 38 presentations and papers were done or published using the collected data. Conclusion: The national Registry for RDS offered a great opportunity to improve the quality of care, collect important epidemiological data, promote the new national guidelines, encourage the implementation of protocols according to each unit level, disseminate information and stimulate research based on the collected data. Background and aims: Birth before 28 weeks of gestation is associated with a high mortality and morbidity. The purpose of this study was to examine characteristics associated with in-hospital mortality and morbidity among extremely-low-birth-weight neonates admitted to three tertiary care centers in Romania. Methods: The study was conducted in three Romanian hospitals with Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Units. We studied singleton live births at the established Romanian limit of viability (i.e., 25-28 weeks gestational age) born between January 2007 and December 2010 (n = 227). Infants born in non-Level III facilities transferred to these three centers were included in our study (n = 39). Descriptive and multivariate statistical analyses were used to describe the population and examine outcomes and risk factors. Background: Mothers are exposed to many toxins that can reach their infants through breast milk. One of these toxins is aflatoxins, produced by Aspergillus fungus which colonizes grains, especially in tropical regions. Aflatoxins are highly toxic, mutagenic, teratogenic, and carcinogenic. One of these is aflatoxin B1 that is excreted in breast milk as aflatoxin M1 (AFM1). Aim of work: Assessment of exposure of Egyptian infants to aflatoxin M1 through breast milk. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 150 mother-infant dyads. All the infants were exclusively breastfed. Infant weights' standard deviation scores were documented at birth and at 6 months. At 6 months, before starting weaning, AFM1 was measured in breast milk and liver enzymes; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase were assessed for all mothers and infants. Results: Ninety-eight mothers (65.3 %) had AFM1-positive breast milk samples (AFM1 [ 0.05 mg/l according to the European Community and Codex Alimentarius). AFM1 levels ranged between 0.2 and 19.0 mg/l (mean: 7.1 \u00b1 5.0 mg/l). In cases considered negative, AFM1 levels ranged between 0.01 and 0.05 mg/l (mean: 0.04 \u00b1 0.01 mg/l). Infants of AFM1-positive mothers had lower weight standard deviation scores at birth and at 6 months (P = 0.04 and 0.0001). ALT and aspartate aminotransferase of mothers and ALT of infants were significantly higher in dyads having AFM1-positive breast milk (P = 0.0001, 0.0001, and 0.03, respectively). Conclusion: Aflatoxins represent a real threat in Egypt. The higher liver enzymes in AFM1-positive cases might represent an alarm toward future development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Aims: The main objective of this study was to examine the incidence and risk factors associated with aggravated general statement, residual impairment and death post PICU hospitalization. Methods: Retrospective study between 1/1/2011-25/02/2012 in a PICU located in a tertiary pediatric hospital. Patients younger than 2 years, with underlying oncological disease and those who died within the first 12 h after admission were excluded.

Conclusions: Although there has been significant improvement in the provided care by PICU, still survival as well as post discharge impairment and quality of life depend on the critical care support provided before admission in PICU. Secondary, severity of illness, estimated by PRISM score is the key factor for the prognosis of the critical ill children. Objectives: Staff in PICU and NICU are required to undertake a wide variety of written tasks, yet few have received formal writing training since leaving school. Complex cases can involve correspondence with parents and professionals unfamiliar with the jargon and practices of ICU. Poor communication can be dangerous, and when things go wrong, written records may be crucial to the outcome of legal cases. Methods: In Late 2012, in collaboration with the Royal Literary Fund, Great Ormond Street Hospital ICU began a brief pilot project to see whether staff would welcome the opportunity to receive one-toone advice from a professional writer. Medical, nursing, and administrative staff at all levels took advantage of the scheme. Topics ranged from everyday written work, and the challenges faced by those for whom English is not their first language, to the refinement of articles for learned journals. Results: Close examination of how and why familiar writing tasks were performed brought suggestions for changes and developments in custom and practice. Unexpected areas for attention, such as potential pitfalls in email correspondence, were highlighted and addressed. Conclusion: Our presentation will describe how the project was conducted, outline the response of individual members of staff to the scheme, and attempt to assess its impact on the written output of the unit. We will explore the potential for future developments, and for implementing similar schemes elsewhere, with a view to enhancing the professional skills of individuals and reducing the reputational and legal risks for institutions in which they work. Background and aim: Adverse events are of major interest, not only because of their impact on patients but also because they provide a measure of quality of health care and opportunity for improvement. This study aimed to identify, at admission, patients at increased risk to experience one or more adverse events in PICU. Methods: All adverse events were registered prospectively during a 13 month period in a 14-bedded PICU. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted, to identify at admission patients who will suffer from one or more adverse events. Results: During the study period the PICU had 658 admissions, with a total of 4,380 patient days. The overall adverse event rate was 0.45 per admission and 68 per 1,000 patient days. Independent positive predictors were PRISM 2 score (truncated above 10) and TISS score (truncated above 25) at admission, significant past medical history and invasive ventilation at admission. Increasing age was a positive predictor above the age of seven and a negative predictor below seven years. Independent negative predictors were transport by PICU retrieval team and immediate postoperative admissions. Conclusion: We identified in our PICU which patients are at risk to experience adverse events.

With ever increasing bed pressure, concerns have been raised that OOH PICU discharge is becoming more frequent. We aim to study effect of OOH discharge on readmissions (rate/morbidity/mortality). Methods: A single centre (PICU, Alder Hey Children's NHS Trust) retrospective review of prospectively collected database over 10 years (January 2003 . The PICU is a 22 bed cardiac and general unit with around 1,100 admissions per year. OOH were defined as hours between 17:00 and 08:00 hours, weekends, and bank holidays. Results: Of the total 9,471 PICU episodes eligible, 330 were admitted with in 48 h (3.36 %). 4,910 (50 %) were discharged OOH and 4,890 office hours. The 48 h readmission rate did not differ between the groups (3.1 vs 3.6 %). However, readmission PICU mortality rate was significantly higher with OOH discharge as compared to office hours discharge (7.86 vs 1.31 %, P value 0.006). PIM2, ventilation days and PICU length of stay for the readmission episodes were not different between the two groups. Conclusions: Readmission rate at our institution is comparable to the published data. There is no difference in 48 h PICU readmission rate between discharge during office hours or OOH time. However, with out of hours discharge there is significantly increased readmission mortality. Objectives: Aim of the study was to assess usefulness of extracorporeal liver support-albumin dialysis with the molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS) for treatment of paediatric patients with acute or acute-on-chronic liver failure. Methods: Study was conducted in tertiary pediatric hospital (national reference centre for paediatric liver transplantations). Retrospective search on medical records of all MARS procedures performed since July 2001 until December 2010 in intensive care unit patients have been performed. All patients treated with at least 1 procedure of MARS, were included into analysis. Results: During 10 years period MARS procedures were used for treatment of 68 patients (37 girls, 31 boys). Age of patients varied from 13 months to 23 years (mean age 10.7 years). Among patients treated with MARS procedures most frequent diagnosis were: acute intoxication (drugs/mushrooms)-19 children and Wilson disease-10 children. During analyzed period 188 MARS procedures were performed, in 48 patients more than one. Mean number of procedures per patient was 2.8 with highest number 9 procedures in one patient. Among all 68 patients treated with MARS 47 children survived (69 %): successful liver transplantation was performed in 26 children, in 21 patients liver functions and clinical status improved significantly without further need for liver transplantation. Conclusions: Results of our study have shown that MARS albumin liver dialysis is effective tool for treatment of paediatric patients with acute liver failure or decompensated chronic liver disease bridging those patients to liver transplantation. The MARS treatment can contribute also to liver regeneration. Objective: Serum procalcitonin has been reported as a marker in the inflammatory response to the infection.

Results: The results of blood culture showed that 46 (65.7 %) of samples were positive. Among them, 18 (39.1 %) had bacterial growth and 28 (60.8 %) fungal. The most frequent bacteria isolates were Klebsiella (38.8 %) and Acinatobactor (22.2 %). Leucopenia was found in both groups. Fifty-two percent had raised CRP in culture positive and 33.3 % in culture negative cases, the differences were statistically significant (p \\ 0.05).

It could be a sensitive marker in early diagnosis of sepsis in neonates. Respiratory viral infections account for significant morbidity and mortality especially in young children worldwide. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) causes illnesses ranging from mild respiratory problems to bronchiolitis and severe pneumonia. From January to December 2007, 220 nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from children younger B13 years old hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infection to detect hMPV by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and to clone and sequence the hMPV-positive samples. Human metapneumovirus was detected in 28 (12.7 %) specimens with a median age of 7 months (range 1.3-24 months). Human metapneumovirus type A and type B were detected in 26 (93 %) and 8 (28.6 %) of specimens, respectively. Coinfection with hMPV type A and type B was detected in 6 (21.4 %) specimens positive for hMPV. The major clinical diagnosis of hMPV-positive patients was bronchiolitis (75 %). Human metapneumovirus and hMPV type B were found to be significantly associated with bronchiolitis (P = 0.03 and 0.01, respectively). Human metapneumovirus and hMPV type A were found to be significantly associated with pneumonia (P = 0.004 and 0.002, respectively).

Objective: Evaluation of the clinical data from infants admitted to the PICU due to bronchiolitis. Patients-methods: Retrospective survey of bronchiolitis patients admitted to two PICUs, which are being analyzed for risk factors (prematurity, CLD, congenital heart disease, chronic oxygen dependence) and need for mechanical ventilation. Results: 120 infants with bronchiolitis were recorded during 2007-2012. 70 % were C36 weeks gestational age (GA), 20 % 32-35 weeks and 11 % B32 weeks. Mean age on admission was the 77 days (44 % B30 days old). Males: females ratio = 75:45. 76 % were admitted between January and March. RSV infection was found in 77 % infants. Risk factors had 13 % of the infants. Palivizumab was administered in 7 infants (6 %). Intubation-mechanical ventilation was needed in 32 infants (27 %), 26 of which had RSV (81 %) and 4 had received palivizumab. 12 infants of the 32 had GA B35 weeks (37 %) and 6 had CLD (19 %). 4 deaths ( Background: Acute epiglottitis occurs rarely in pediatrics, since the systematic vaccination against Haemophilus influenza type b. Surprisingly, the last decades, other pathogens such as Neisseria meningitidis, are reported to cause acute epiglottitis in children but in adults as well. Case report: A 4.5 years old male, previously healthy toddler, from Russia, was on summer vacations in Greece. He experienced sudden onset of intense sore throat and the following day, high fever (40 o C) and respiratory distress emerged. Primary diagnose was bacterial pharyngotonsillitis, thus azithromycin was initiated, but as his condition worsened, he was treated for laryngitis with oxygen, nebulized adrenalin and iv dexamethasone. Ten hours later, the boy's condition was critical, with emerging respiratory failure. A lateral neck roentgenogram confirmed the diagnose of epiglottitis, showing diffuse soft tissue cervical and epiglottic swelling (thumb sign). He was intubated in the operating room, he was given iv ceftriaxone and he was transferred to the PICU. Initial laboratory findings were WBC = 12 9 10 9 /L (51 % polymorphonuclears, 26 % bands), PLT = 188 9 10 9 /L and CRP = 11 mg/dl. Cultures from blood, sputum (via endotracheal tube), pharyngeal smear, after the onset of antibiotics were negative. PCR from sputum (via endotracheal tube) and blood sample, reviled presence of N. meningitidis (non A, B, C, Y, W135), but not H. influenza. The child hadn't been immunized against both organisms, since they are not included in Russia's obligatory vaccination program. Conclusion: N. meningitidis has been reported to cause epiglottitis since 1995. Though few cases are reported globally, surveillance is needed for better awareness of the disease. 3 Tergooiziekenhuizen, Hilversum, The Netherlands", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3495, "end": 3496, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "Objectives: During sepsis, mechanical ventilation (MV) is thought to contribute to the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) and renal apoptosis may be involved.

Background: Apnea is frequently observed early in RSV infection when symptoms are confined to the upper airways, suggesting inflammatory response induced autonomic dysfunction. Objective: The aim of the study is to assess autonomic dysfunction as indexed by Heart Rate Variability (HRV) in acute RSV infection and its correlation with disease severity and inflammatory profiles. Methods: Prospective study in infants with moderate and severe RSV infection admitted to an university hospital. Controls were age matched infants without signs of infection. Autonomic function was assessed via HRV, monitoring low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) indices. In addition levels of serum SAA-1 (HK333), serum amyloid P (HK331), Pentraxin 3 (HK347), properdin (HK334) and C-reactive protein (HK358) were determined by ELISA. Results: In 15 severely affected patients, 6 moderately affected patients and 72 healthy controls a total of 207 recordings were analyzed. Total HRV, LF and LF/HF ratios were significant lower in severely affected RSV patients versus moderately affected patients (p \\ 0.00045, p \\ 0.002 and p \\ 0.0025, respectively) and severely affected patients and controls (p \\ 0.0002, p \\ 0.0002 and p \\ 0.0001, respectively). Also CRP, properdin and SAA were significantly correlated with disease severity. PTX3 levels were correlated with need for supplemental oxygen. Conclusion: RSV infection in infants is associated with inflammatory response induced autonomic dysfunction of central origin. This may be correlated with an increased risk for serious apnea or ALTE, for which prolonged cardio respiratory monitoring is indicated. S86 Intensive Care Med (2013) 39 (Suppl 1):S1-S200 Background and aims: Sepsis is a leading reason for admission on pediatric intensive care units worldwide and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population. We aim to objectify our hypothesis that there is a shift in causal organisms from N. meningitidis towards Group A Streptococcus (GAS).

Most children were previously in good health. In 15 patients, N. meningitidis was isolated, in 12 GAS. Mortality in our cohort was fully contributable to the subgroup with GAS infection. Children with Meningococcal disease had more chance to have a relatively uneventful course (6/15 vs 2/12). There appears to be a shift towards more frequent isolation of GAS compared with N. meningitidis over the years, though numbers are to small to be statistically significant. Remarkably, GAS-infection in our cohort only occured as a surinfection during the course of acute infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV). Conclusion: A genuine increase of community-acquired sepsis caused by GAS compared to N. meningitidis needs to be confirmed in a multi-centre analysis. Our findings may add fuel to the debate wether to vaccinate our children against VZV or not. Conclusions: Early ferritin estimation of above 10,000 ng/ml following admission is clearly diagnostic, but not predictive of a negative outcome in HLH; probably due to prompt and effective management of the disease process in its early stages with well proven treatment modalities.

Our cases were confirmed to be caused by R. conorii using immunofluorescence methods completed by Western blot and cross-absorption. Cases were encountered in the summer. Two children presented with two eschars. This is quite unusual in MSF. However, particular climate, including higher temperature, reported in Oran in recent years, may have led to an increased proclivity of ticks to bite. Although 62.5 % of the children, were hospitalised, only two (with seizures). Cases were particularly severe in adults; 49 % of 167 patients diagnosed with MSF were hospitalised with a severe form. Cases of MSF seem to be milder in children than in adults. In adults, the eschar is most often observed on the trunk and legs. Herein, the eschar is frequently localised on the cephalic area.

Chloramphenicol continues to be used as the empirical parenteral treatment of severe cases if presence vomiting and lack of intravenous doxycycline. Josamycin can be used in children, but newer macrolides are also of interest, particularly azithromycin. MSF seems to be still misdiagnosed in children as other eruptive febrile diseases.

The identification of risk factors for severe disease (prematurity, maternal symptomatic infection at the time of delivery, early onset and viral serotype) is crucial for appropriate management. Case series: We describe three cases of late preterm newborns, occurred between June 2012 and January 2013, with onset in the first week of life with coagulopathy, ALF and mothers febrile before delivery. The first and the third patient died at 27 and 13 days of life, respectively, despite prompt aggressive supportive care and massive transfusion therapy. The second one, after a critical initial phase and liver biopsy, improved and was removed from the transplant list. In the first two cases Coxackie B viral genome (serotype B3 and B4, respectively) was detected on blood, cerebrospinal fluid and bone marrow. In the last one an Enterovirus was also identified (serotyping in progress at the moment). Neonatal hemochromatosis, initially suspected in the first case because of intra and extra hepatic siderosis, was not confirmed on histological examination. Discussion: Enterovirus can lead to severe ALF and death in newborns and must be always considered in the differential diagnosis of neonatal ALF. We underline the importance of early recognition of risk factors in pregnant women and of clinical manifestations in newborn infants. Background: Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) controls heme degradation, and the products of this process confer anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Recently, we demonstrated that HO-1 deficiency promotes NEC-like intestinal injury in mice. A decreased ratio of T-regulatory (Treg) to T-effector (CD4, CD8, Teff) cells in necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) has been reported. Aim: To study whether a deficiency in HO-1 affects neonatal adaptive immunity by modulating T cell populations. Methods: 7-10 day-old HO-1 heterozygous (HO-1 +/-) and wild-type (Wt) mice were given vehicle (Con) or 5 mg LPS/kg IP. To induce NEC-like injury, 7 day-old Wt pups were fed 200 lL formula/4 h orally for 30 h. On D1.5 and 7, pups were exposed to 5 % O 2 . For flow cytometry analyses, intestinal lamina propria (ILP) cells were stained with CD45, CD3, CD8, CD4, CD25, and FOXP3 antibodies. Results: Preliminary studies show a similar number of FOXP3 hiexpressing CD4 + CD25 + Tregs in Con HO-1 +/-(88 \u00b1 3 %) and Wt pups (93 \u00b1 1 %). 12 h after LPS, FOXP3 hi expression decreased to 79 \u00b1 0.1 % and 85 \u00b1 3 % in CD4 + CD25 + T cells of HO-1 +/and Wt pups, respectively. The Treg/Teff ratio in HO-1 +/pups was 11 \u00b1 6 % (Treg/CD4) and 22 \u00b1 2 % (Treg/CD8) lower than in Wt pups 12 h post-LPS treatment, decreasing further in HO-1 +/pups after 24 h [39 \u00b1 7.5 % (Treg/CD4), 35 \u00b1 14 % (Treg/CD8)]. After NEC induction in Wt pups, FOXP3 hi expression in CD4 + CD25 + T cells decreased by 30-40 %. Conclusion: FOXP3 hi CD4 + CD25 + Tregs and the Treg/Teff ratio in the ILP are compromised in HO-1 +/pups after LPS treatment. If the reduction of Tregs in Wt pups after NEC induction is more severe in HO-1 +/mice will be further studied.

Procalcitonin is considered a useful marker of severe bacterial infection and sepsis in these situations. The aims were to assess the profile of procalcitonin and C-reactive protein (CRP) in the postoperative period of children admitted to PICU, and to compare them as markers of systemic bacterial infection. Table 1 . A nearly significant decrease in in-hospital mortality is observed while less neonates had a high-risk-CRIB-score. Logistic regression analysis adjusting for risk factors for death confirmed that survival improved over time (cf. Table 2 ). Conclusion: In-hospital mortality in patients with HABSI decreased with time. A CRIB-score lower than five and admission in a more recent period of time, was protective for mortality. Infantile botulism is a rare cause of paralysis in infants. The vast majority of cases of infant botulism are caused by botulinum toxin types A and B and only few cases of type F neurotoxin has been identified in infant botulism and reported. We report a severe case of infant botulism caused by botulinum toxin types B and F in a 5 months old baby. Case report: NP, female, 6.2 kg of body weight. She presented in the ED of a regional hospital with a 2-days story of constipation, poor feeding, and lethargy, poor respiratory effort and hypotonia since 12 h. Due to child deterioration, intubation and ventilation were required and she was transferred in our PICU. Botulism was clinically suspected and confirmed by EMG and by the presence in stool sample of toxin B and F producing Clostridium botulinum on PCR. Because of the lack of efficacy of botulism immunoglobulin (BabyBig) for type F toxin, we administered supportive therapy and tried to eradicate the clostridium strains from the intestine through bowel irrigation. The present study showed that gram negative organisms, in particular, E. coli are the most common causes of sepsis in this region. It also indicated that gram negative strains causing septicemia showed most common resistance to current antibodies, so that more than 50 % resistance was observed in most of these organisms. Severe head trauma is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in childhood. The aim of this retrospective study was to put forward the outcomes of patients with severe traumatic brain injury and the factors effective on these outcomes. A total of 61 with severe brain injury were included in the study. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were applied to 45 ( Background and aims: In a previous study we validated the QS4-G designed to evaluate the neuropsychological and behavioural developmental status of four-year-old children and to identify children in need of further evaluation. The validation of the QS4-G was conducted on a sample of preterm and at-term children (263 as a whole) and was focused on reliability, internal consistency, concurrent validity and discriminant validity. We present here the accuracy of the QS4-G in predicting cognitive, neuropsychological, and academic performance at school age 4/6 years later. Methods: Fifty-one children were consecutively recruited from September 2007 to December 2008 at Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital in Rome and in a primary school. They were selected from the original sample and were representative of it. The sample was assessed with standardized test in cognitive, neuropsychological, and academic performances. According to the results obtained in the QS4-G, the sample was divided into two groups: at-risk and not-at-risk. Crosstabs were used to assess if the at-risk and the not-at-risk group presented difficulties as to cognitive, neuropsychological and academic performances 4-6 years later. Results: Children in the at-risk group, 4-6 years later, presented difficulties in neuropsychological abilities (0.000) and academic performances (0.035); 43.7 % of them improved their cognitive abilities. Not-at-risk group presented adequate cognitive (0.000) and neuropsychological (0.000) performances; almost half of them developed difficulties in academic performances. Conclusions: QS4-G has a good predictive validity as to neuropsychological abilities. Clinicians should follow up carefully children identified as at-risk by the questionnaire. Objective: Hyperglycemia can occur in the patients affected by any kind of critical illnesses. It has been recently shown that treatment of hyperglycemia with insulin administration significantly reduces the prevalence of critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy and on the other hand reduces the demand for long-term mechanical ventilation in the patients admitted in ICU for more than 1 week. The aim of this study was to determine the therapeutic effect of Insulin in reduction of the incidence of critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy in pediatric intensive care unit. Materials and methods: In this study we recruited 30 patients admitted in the PICU of Tabriz Pediatric Hospital and evaluated incidence of CIPNM following hyperglycemia in these patients. The patients were categorized into two groups. In the case group blood sugar was controlled in the range of 140-180 mg/dl by administration of insulin (in the form of drips and in the account of 0.05 U per each kilogram of body weight in hour) and in the control group placebo was used, and then the incidence of CIPNM, duration of PICU and duration of mechanical ventilation were compared between two groups. Results: In this study the incidence of CIPNM and duration of PICU stay and duration of mechanical ventilation were significantly reduced in the patients treated with Insulin compared to the control group. Conclusion: This study shows that controlling of blood sugar results in reduction of incidence of critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy. Background and aims: Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is an important cause of brain injury in premature infants. This study aimed to assess early development in very low birth weight and/or very premature infants who had IVH in the neonatal period and to compare their neurodevelopment with their IVH grade. Methods: A retrospective review of medical records was performed for all newborns treated in a neonatal intensive care unit, between 2003 and 2009, who weighted \\1,500 g and/or who were born before the 32th gestational week. Only the infants with IVH were enrolled in this study. Results: Among the 63 infants, 54 % were female, the median gestational age was 28 weeks and mean birth weight 1,074 \u00b1 335 g. The IVH was bilateral in 71 % of the patients.

Conclusions: Although our study has a small sample, the long-term outcome of infants who survive with IVH worsens with increasing severity of IVH. Severe (grade 4) IVH is related to higher mortality rate, higher prevalence of periventricular leukomalacia and posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus and lower scores in neurodevelopment outcome. Many factors which are independent from the grade of the IVH seem to influence the neurodevelopment outcome. Introduction: In this study we presented etiological factors, clinical course and prognosis of rhabdomyolysis in nontraumatic critically ill children who are admitted to Akdeniz University PICU. Method: Total 219 patients laboratory data were screened retrospectively who are admitted to PICU in 2011 using with electronic records and who has 5 folds acute increased serum Creatin Kinase levels enrolled the study. Demographic data, laboratory values, organ failures, and prognosis of these patients were recorded. Results: Rhabdomyolysis established at eleven patients (5 %). In most of the patient, asphyxia and perfusion abnormalities were the reason of rhabdomyolysis. Average length of stay in PICU was 10 days (range 2-34 days) and average length of mechanical ventilation was 8 days (1-34 days). Eight of them had known chronic illness on the admission of PICU. None of them developed serious hypocalcaemia or hyperkalemia. Eight of the 11 (72 %) patient had acute renal injury according to RIFLE criteria and hemodialysis used three of them. Six of the 11 (54 %) patient died. Three of the patient died had physical findings of acute congestive heart failure. Discussion: According to this retrospective analysis; rhabdomyolysis mostly associated with perfusion disabilities at the nontraumatic critically ill child who needs PICU admission. Length of PICU admission and mechanical ventilation is not different from general population at present study. When acute renal injury and acute congestive heart failure accompany the rhabdomyolysis, they increase the mortality.

In the face of this dilemma, the currently most commonly used methods to take a decision in these circumstances are depending on the personal knowledge or experience, nihilism, defer to other experts, defer to patients, dogmatism or just blindly follow a policy. These methods are not scientifically sound. They are not only lacking objectivity but more importantly lacking evidence supporting it. It may also minimize patient/family adequate involvement. This situation is frequently encountered in making decisions of management of critically ill children and neonates. In the recent era of evidence based medicine, full arrays of decision support aids were developed. Among which an important method, unfortunately infrequently used, the evidence based decision analysis (DA). In this presentation, we will explain this important tool for decision aids and how it can help in making difficult decisions by utilizing the best available scientific evidence (to elicit probability factors) together with incorporating the patient/family own preferences and values (to elicit disutility factors). This scientifically validated method is assure maximum objectivity by expressed numerical values of disutility and probability and re-computing it in a backpropagation manner.

Diazepam or midazolam oral recommended for FC prevention, but the effectiveness of prophylactic treatment with medication remains controversial. Prophylactic use of oral anticonvulsant drugs is thus a questionable practice. We designed this article to survey the effect of diazepam in prevention of seizure in FC. Methods and materials: We conducted this study upon 186 child 6-60 mo in Imam Reza hospital in Kermanshah from 1,386 and followed those 24 months. Patients studied in three groups: group A: if had fever received oral diazepam 1 mg/kg/day, group B received oral diazepam 0.4-0.6 mg/kg/day, group C: when had fever did not received diazepam, then recurrence rate of seizure and demographic data were documented and analyzed. Results: Group A (n = 76), Group B (n = 77), Group C (n = 33). Recurrence rate of febrile seizure were in (group A: 23.7 %, group B: 23.4 %, group C: 24.2 %). There was no statistically significant difference between 3 groups (p value = 0.930).Recurrent rate of seizure in patients with positive family history of febrile convulsion were more common. Conclusion: Results of this study showed use of oral diazepam in begin of fever couldn't decrease the recurrent rate of seizure in febrile convulsion. Objectives: We investigated the pattern of mortality at a PICU and explored if any unusual pathogens are associated with these deaths. Methods: Demographic data of all PICU deaths were analyzed. Results: There were 81 deaths (males 59 %; infants 25 %) over the 10-year period between 2002 and 2012. The mean annual mortality rate of PICU admissions was 5.7 %. Septicemia with common gram positive (commonest coagulase negative staphylococcus), gram negative (commonest pseudomonas) and fungal (commonest candida species) pathogens were present in 12 (15 %), 13 (16 %) and 5 (6 %) of these patients, respectively. Viruses (commonest CMV) were isolated in 20 patients (25 %). 91 % of these patients were ventilated, 73 % required inotropes, 91 % received broad spectrum antibiotic coverage, 31 % received systemic corticosteroids, 52 % blood transfusion and 38 % anticonvulsants. 36 patients (44 %) had a DNAR (Do-Not-Attempt-Resuscitation order) prior to their death at the PICU. Oncological diagnoses (n = 24) were predominant diagnoses. In the trauma category (n = 9), patients were more likely to present with cardiac arrest preceding ICU admission, and to have brain death subsequently. Trauma deaths typically affected healthy boys and not involving any pathogens. There was no gunshot or asthma death. Postmortem examination was performed in 30 % deaths.

Background and aims: This nationwide multicenter study reports neurodevelopmental outcome of children treated with neonatal extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) by evaluating intelligence, type of education, concentration and eye-hand coordination at 8 years of age. Methods: A follow-up study was conducted in 135 8-year-olds who received neonatal ECMO between 1996 and 2001. The children underwent a structural psychological assessment for intelligence (Revised Amsterdam Intelligence Test), concentration (Bourdon-Vos) and eye-hand coordination (Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration). Results: Intelligence (n = 125) did not differ from reference norm with a mean (SD) IQ of 99.9 (17.7); 91 % attended regular education. Significantly more children needed extra support (39 %) at regular education compared with reference norms. The children had significantly slower working speed (v 2 = 132.36, p \\ 0.001) and were significantly less accurate (v 2 = 12.90, p \\ 0.001) on the Bourdon-Vos (n = 123) compared to reference norms.

The participants of this study represent all VLBW-infants born within a 3-years period in Hamburg/Germany enrolled in a longitudinal program. At the age of 20-22 years a detailed questionnaire was sent to the former VLBW-infants. Those with cerebral palsy were excluded. We still reached 135 of the former 329 infants (41 %). The participants were representative in terms of neurological outcome at the age of 6 years. 58 additional participants of the former control group could be evaluated in the same manner. Former preterm participants showed significant lower values compared with control participants concerning body length, weight and head circumference. BMI was significantly reduced only in female participants. Significant more preterm participants underwent surgical procedures, Refractive errors were more frequent in preterm participants. Only two still suffered from epilepsy. Recurrent pain episodes were, however, found more frequently in the control participants. 75 % of the preterm participants were living still together with their parents. Preterm participants more often had to repeat a school year and reached a lower level of education, pronounced in male, AGA-, very preterm (GA \\31 weeks) participants and those with neurological abnormalities other than CP at 6 years of age. Regarding health situation of former not disabled VLBW-infants our results should be considered in the aspect of transition. A major percentage of those with later low educational level could be recognized already in childhood. Infants born very preterm (\\32 weeks gestational age) are at risk of development problems including motor, cognitive, and visual impairments. We developed a quantitative test, using remote eyetracking, to assess higher-order visual functions in young infants. The aim of our study was to investigate visual development in very preterm infants compared to controls at 12 and 24 months of age. Methods: We included 17 very preterm infants without any brain injury on repeated ultrasound and MRI scans (low-risk very preterms). Visual processing was assessed in terms of oculomotor reaction time to make an eye movement towards a stimulus displayed in the quadrants of a monitor with an integrated remote eye-tracker system. Conclusion: These results suggest that, at the age of 2, no difference in visual processing is present between low-risk very preterms and controls. In the future we will also assess visual information processing in high-risk very preterms, and we will correlate the visual assessment to the degree and location of neonatal brain damage. Methods: We reviewed all the echocardiograms performed on our neonatal unit in 2011 and 2012 to identify babies born at \\32 weeks gestation who had an echocardiogram for assessment of CLD. Results: In 2011 and 2012 a total of 52 echocardiograms were done in babies born at \\32 weeks gestation as part of assessment of CLD. Median gestational age was 25 weeks (range 23-30), median birth weight was 785 g (range 500-1,688 g). Two babies were found to have significant pulmonary hypertension (PH) requiring multidisciplinary management and subsequently died due to respiratory failure secondary to PH. Five babies needed referral to paediatric cardiology services for congenital heart defects. Five babies had persistent ductus arteriosus (PDA) which was felt to be haemodynamically significant at that age. Five babies had evidence of hypertrophy of ventricular myocardium. Four babies had evidence of moderate tricuspid regurgitation which prompted further follow-up. Conclusions: Our retrospective review found that echocardiogram is a very useful tool for the assessment of babies with CLD. The incidence of significant pulmonary hypertension in our cohort of babies is around 4 % which is much less than previously quoted in other studies. 40 % of the babies in this cohort had other significant findings on echocardiograms performed at 36 weeks CGA that prompted change in management. Objectives: Recent evidence favors primary role of cellular autoimmunity and its humoral mediators in pathogenesis and following type 1 diabetes mellitus (IDDM).

Potential role of glycemic control, body mass index and disease duration were evaluated. Designes and methods: Thirty-five children with IDDM and 30 age and six matched non diabetic healthy subjects were recruited for this study from the outpatient clinic of diabetes of National Institute of Diabetes and Endocrinology. Results: Circulating level at TNF-a, IL-6 and sIL-2R were elevated in children with type 1 DM (39.91 \u00b1 17.46, 14.89 \u00b1 10.69 and 779.0 \u00b1 467.06 pg/ml, respectively). Compared with non diabetic controls (5.67 \u00b1 1.88, 6.23 \u00b1 2.78 and 254.33 \u00b1 173.6 pg/ml, respectively). These differences were statistically highly significant (\\0.0001). Glycemic control, Insulin dose and disease duration were not significant predictors of cytokines concentration in children with IDDM.

However, teaching of aEEG interpretation is highly variable in methodology, quality and effectiveness worldwide. Online teaching ensures consistently high quality, labour efficient teaching which can be accessed by students at their own convenience and pace of learning. Aim: To assess aEEG interpretation skills before and after an online, structured aEEG teaching programme, and to gather feedback about its effectiveness. Methods: Surveys were performed on nurses and doctors, both before and after 3 sessions of online aEEG teaching. Baseline characteristics of participants were gathered, as well as subjective and objective criteria for effectiveness. Results: A total of 37 NICU staff were involved, including 32 nurses and 5 doctors. Statistically significant improvement in subjective knowledge score (p = 0.01) was found pre and post online teaching. There was a high incidence of appreciation for the need to know aEEG (93.1 %). There was also an improvement in knowledge of the indications, although this was not significant. Passing rates for correct aEEG interpretation of tracings, (defined as 3 or more out of 5 correct answers) improved from 13.6 to 81.8 % (p = 0.047). Post teaching, 96.0 % felt the teaching was well structured and 77.8 % felt duration was optimal. In addition, 80.0 % felt they were able to systematically approach aEEG interpretation and 70.4 % felt they could interpret normal aEEG with confidence. Conclusion: Online, structured aEEG teaching effectively improves aEEG interpretation and should be considered as the method of choice.

The aim of the study: The purpose of this study was to investigated the relationship between S100B concentrations within gestational age in normal preterm and term infants. Methods: 119 neonates were recruited, divided into a control group (N = 48) and an overall risk group (N = 71). The risk neonates were categorized into subgroups according to their clinical presentation. A serum blood sample was obtained from each patient at three different time-points: 24 h post-injury, 4th and 7th day after the admission. S100B levels were measured using electro-chemi-luminescence Immuno Assay. We used SPSS 16.0 statistical programme.

Conclusion: S100 B protein in term and preterm infants is significantly higher in the first 24 h after birth. Thus, S100B protein is a good indicator of starting brain damage in term neonates, in the first 24 h after birth and is a indicator for early intervention. In preterm neonates it is indicator for possible early brain damage.

To determine the efficacy of Tau and S100B proteins, promising biomarkers in the detection and prediction of outcome in hypoxic or traumatic neuronal injury, in early detection of bilirubin-induced neurological dysfunction (BIND) in newborn infants with hyperbilirubinemia, 20 term infants with a diagnosis of hyperbilirubinemia requiring phototherapy and/or exchange transfusion and 20 term infants with normal findings were included as the control group. Blood samples were collected on admission during venipuncture for bilirubin level or biochemical tests both in study and control groups, a second sample was taken 48 h after admission only in the study group. Tau and S100B proteins were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A complete neurologic examination and BIND scoring was performed in all infants on admission and otoacoustic emissions (OAE) were measured. Both Tau and S-100B protein levels were higher in those with total serum bilirubin levels over 20 mg/dl. Serum Tau protein levels were elevated in exchange-transfused ones, in those with a bilirubin/albumin ratio [7, with abnormal scoring of BIND on admission and after 48 h; and at 48th hours in those whose OAE results were abnormal. S-100B protein levels at admission were only higher in those with blood group incompatibility, and exchange-transfused ones. The sensitivity and specificity of Tau protein in the detection of abnormal BIND scoring on admission (cut-off 22 pg/ml) and 48 h (cut-off 772.2 pg/ml) were 83.3, 62.5 and 58.3, 100 %, respectively. In conclusion, serum Tau protein as a biomarker may be useful in determining BIND in term newborn infants.

The Tracheal Team at Great Ormond Street Hospital is a unique service and the patients under our care will require a well prepared admission to an intensive care area due to the complexity and rarity of the disease. Currently there is limited availability of paediatric intensive care (PICU) beds in the United Kingdom (UK) due to service competition for beds, as well as reduced availability of paediatric intensive care nurses and a lack of access to highly skilled medical doctors due to current European Working Time Directives. As a small specialist team functioning within a quaternary hospital we are continually required to look at new ways of delivering PICU care. One of these approaches is through developing autonomous intensive care nursing practice using the advanced skill model. The tracheal clinical nurse specialist (CNS), who has extensive intensive care experience, uses a combination of communication, service knowledge and advanced skills (to Masters level) to keep the use of PICU beds to a safe minimum whilst still maintaining high quality care (supported by PREMS). Areas of advanced nurse practice include triaging PICU patients from national and international destinations, expert communication with referrers, requesting investigations such as bronchoscopies and bronchograms, nurse led ward round and decision making, new prescriptions and medication modifications, leading discharge planning, ongoing communication and treatment plans, audit and data collection. If this model continues to optimize the access and use of PICU beds for a patient group this model of Advanced Nursing Practice should continue to develop further.

A standardised postoperative pain management was implemented for the NICU using an escalation scheme. Aim: To identify side effects when using metamizol in postoperative pain management for neonates. Methods: ''Off-label-use'' was discussed with the parents, written consent was given. 70 neonates (ranging from 22 6/7 to 41 4/7 weeks of gestation), were operated between 1st day of life and 3 months, weighing 470-9,900 g (median 2,712 g) between 1/2010 and 12/2012. Surgery included laparotomy, craniotomy and ductus ligation. The neonatal infant pain score (NIPS) was used to assess pain.

The application of protocols in a Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) improves the critical care and promotes a better outcome in different areas of interventions. The aims of these protocols are to define a set of procedures that, when implemented together and involving the multidisciplinary team, can further enhance patient care. In our PICU we are currently implementing three new performance protocols, namely Enteral Feeding, Pain Management and Fever Management. The first one provides a focused approach to reach children's individual nutritional needs according to their clinical condition and to allow greater autonomy for professionals in order to achieve nutritional objectives in a more effective way. The second one aims a faster and more efficient pharmacological intervention towards pain according to the score determined by the different scales evaluation. The last one was implemented to better treat fever according to the specific disease, recognizing that in some cases higher temperatures can have a protective role, while in other cases it should be aggressively treated.

Whether acute or chronic pain, health professionals should be aware that this induces unbearable suffering that reflects negatively in the child's welfare. Its treatment is, therefore, clinically and ethically required. Given the importance of an effective pharmacological intervention towards pain in a Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) setting, pain management guidelines were developed by a multidisciplinary team of paediatric intensive care professionals and are being implemented since December 2012. It is our purpose to reduce the incidence and severity of pain in all paediatric patients admitted in the PICU. Methods: The guidelines are based on both behavioral and self report evaluation of pain using different scales according to the child's age, development and clinical status.

The survey compared the physicians' definitions of live birth and fetal death, the gestational age at which they consider infants viable, their resuscitation practices for infants born at \\28 weeks gestation and their practices for extremely premature labor and delivery. This study uses the result of the 2008 survey and specified variables from the linked live birth/infant death data sets for 2007-2009 from New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to examine the impact of physicians' live birth definitions on the infant mortality rate in New York City maternity hospitals. Hospitals whose neonatologists report that they follow the New York City reporting requirement and report all live births regardless of gestational age had mortality rate for infants born at \\23 weeks gestation that was six times that of hospitals whose neonatologists reported that they include gestational age as part of their live birth criteria and as a result do not follow the New York City reporting requirement. This study highlights the impact of the gap between clinical practices and reporting requirements for live birth. Whereas reporting requirements are based on definitions of live birth and fetal death, physicians make resuscitation and other clinical decisions regarding extremely premature infants based on definitions of viability and these resuscitation practices can impact infant mortality data.

Transcutaneous bilirubin measurement (TCB) by special devices had been documented as an effective tool for predicting neonatal jaundice in full term neonate, but for preterm infant the present evidences are controversial. We carried out a prospective study in Shariati Hospital NICU. 126 paired TCB/TSB measurements were obtained.TCB (on forehead and sternum) were obtained by JH2-1A device for every admitted preterm infant who clinically showed jaundice and total serum bilirubin (TSB) measurements was obtained within 30 min of TCB. 58 (46 %) were male and 68 (54 %) were female. The mean gestational age was 31 week and mean birth weight was 1,728 \u00b1 60 gr. 30 % of neonates were ill. The mean value obtained by TBS was 8.8 mg/dl and for frontal TCB was 8.2 mg/ dl and for sternal TCB was 7.4 mg/dl. There were good correlation between TBS and TCB and the maximum correlation were seen in 33-37 weeks of gestation and birth weight more than 2,500 gr with forehead TCB measurement. Healthy preterms had significant correlation of TSB and TCB (r = 0.56, p \\ 0.001) and ill preterm neonate had r = 0.82, P \\ 0.001. The correlation between TBS and TCB with and without phototherapy was r = 0.66, p = 0.000 and r = 0.69, p = 0.000, respectively. Although TCB measurement may underestimate TBS but there is significant correlation between TCB and TBS in preterms even in ill neonate or who receiving phototherapy and so reduces the number of blood sampling in preterm. Results: Infants gestational ages were mean 27, 1 weeks and mean postnatal age was 10, 8 days. Correlations were calculated between PIPP and EDIN on NCR 1 and NCR 2, and Spearman's rho were 0, 60 (p \\ 0, 01) and 0, 57 (p \\ 0, 01) respectively. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient was used to calculate inter-rater reliability, and was moderate to poor.

The low EDIN scores suggest infants in non-pain situations. Conclusion: The Norwegian version of the EDIN scale is recommended for assessing prolonged pain and discomfort in preterm neonates on ventilator support.

Background and aims: Labetalol is thought to be safe and effective to treat hypertension during pregnancy. Nevertheless, beta-adrenergic blockade of labetalol can result in hypotension, bradycardia and hypoglycemia in the newborn. Care-takers should be aware of these potential complications. However, unnecessary admission of the neonate should be avoided. This study evaluates possible neonatal effects after maternal use of labetalol. Methods: All infants born alive in the VU University Medical Center between 1 January 2011 and 1 September 2012, with a gestational age of C36 weeks exposed to labetalol B48 h prior to delivery were included. Labetalol dosage and route of administration, gestational age, birth weight, maximum carbohydrate intake (MCHI) and the incidence of hypotension, bradycardia and hypoglycemia were obtained from maternal and neonatal records. Results: In this period, 37 neonates were exposed to labetalol. Seven patients were excluded because of incomplete data. Labetalol was administered orally in 27 (200-1,800 mg/day) and intravenously in 3 (480-2,400 mg/day) mothers. Hypoglycemia occurred in 13 infants (43 %), in which 8 infants needed intravenously administration of glucose (mean MCHI 6.5 mg/kg/min). 8 of 13 infants with hypoglycemia were born at term and appropriate for gestational age (AGA). Hypoglycemia occurred \\10 h after birth. Conclusions: Hypoglycemia occurred in 43 % of prenatally exposed (pre) term neonates, possibly due to decreased gluconeogenesis. Adequate monitoring of blood glucose during day 1 in (term and preterm) neonates after prenatal exposure of labetalol is therefore recommended. Introduction: Despite limited information on the pharmacokinetics of excipients, propylene glycol (PG) is often used as a co-drug both in adults and children. The aim of this study is to characterize renal elimination in relation to hepatic clearance of propylene glycol in preterm and term neonates. Methods: The pharmacokinetic analysis of PG was performed in NONMEM 6.2. on the basis of PG concentrations in plasma and/or urine samples for a total of 69 (pre)term neonates (birth weight 630-3,980 g, gestational age 24-41 weeks, postnatal age 1-29 days) who received PG co-administered with IV paracetamol (5-10 mg/kg/ 6 h) or phenobarbital (5 mg/kg/day) or both. Results: A one compartment model parameterized in terms of renal clearance, hepatic clearance and volume of distribution was found to adequately describe the observations in both plasma and urine. After the first dose, renal elimination of propylene glycol was 15 % of total clearance which increased over time to 25 % at 24 h after the first dose. This increase was best described by a hyperbolic function based on time after the first dose. Conclusions: Renal elimination of PG in (pre)term neonates is low compared to hepatic clearance, particularly compared to the reported percentage of 45 % in adults. To evaluate whether the reported increase in renal elimination of PG over time after first dose indicates an auto-induced increase in renal secretion or failure of tubular reabsorption of PG, further research is needed. Objectives: Clonidine is often used as a sedative in critically ill children, but its effectiveness has not been tested in a large, rigorous randomized controlled trial (RCT). Our objectives in this pilot RCT were to assess the feasibility of a larger trial with respect to: (1) Timely enrollment, (2) Effective screening, (3) Protocol adherence, and (4) Recruitment. Methods: Randomized, concealed, blinded, placebo-controlled, pilot trial. Eligible patients were hemodynamically stable children aged 1 month-18 years who were expected to require at least 2 days of mechanical ventilation and who required an opioid or benzodiazepine infusion for sedation. Children were randomized to enteral clonidine 5 mcg/kg or placebo every 6 h in addition to usual sedation. Results: We enrolled 50 children in 2 centres. The median (IQR) age was 2.5 (0.7-5.2) years and PRISM score on PICU admission was 12 (8-15). In terms of feasibility outcomes: 35 (70 %) were enrolled within 1 day of becoming eligible (mean 1.2 days). 91 (88 %) of 104 eligible patients were approached for consent, 87.5 % of doses were administered according to protocol and on average 1.7 children were enrolled/month. The median (IQR) duration of ventilation and PICU stay was 6 (3-11) and 10 (7-21) days, respectively. 6 (12 %) children had doses held or modified due to hypotension and the incidence of clinically diagnosed withdrawal was 32 %. Conclusions: This pilot trial suggests that a larger RCT to evaluate the effect of clonidine on clinically important outcomes is feasible. Objectives: Many drugs are prescribed to children and substrate to drug transporters. Transporters are membrane-bound proteins involved in drug absorption and disposition. Variation in transporters may affect drug levels and efficacy. However little is known about developmental changes of transporter expression during childhood. These changes may impact drug levels resulting in over-or underdosing when unaccounted for. Aim: To assess whether intestinal and hepatic transporter expression is age-related. Methods: Expression was determined using postmortem liver (fetuses n = 9, neonates n = 21 [birth-1 month], infants n = 8 [1 month-12 months], children n = 3 [1 year-17 years], adults n = 11) and surgical small bowel samples (neonates n = 21, infants n = 7, children n = 1, adults n = 11). Target gene expression was determined using real time RT-PCR compared to adult expression using the DDCt-method. Significance level was set at p \\ 0.05. Results: Hepatic expression of MDR1 was significantly lower in fetuses, neonates and infants compared to adults. Hepatic expression of MRP2, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in all age groups was significantly lower compared to adults. Intestinal expression of MDR1 and MRP2 was comparable with adults. However, intestinal OATP2B1 expression was significantly higher in neonates and infants compared to adults. Conclusion: Hepatic and intestinal drug transporter expression show organ-and transporter-specific maturation patterns. Suggesting substrate drugs to transporters may be subject to age-related changes in absorption. Studies on protein expression and in vivo activity are needed to predict the clinical relevance. This may impact dosing of substrate drugs to children of different ages. Supported by Novartis investigator-initiated grant. Introduction: As delirium in critically ill children is increasingly recognized, more children are treated with the antipsychotic drug haloperidol. Little is known on its safety in this context. Objective: To investigate the incidence and nature of adverse events associated with administration of haloperidol and its relationship with dose. Methods: All patients admitted to the PICU between January 2000 and July 2011 who received haloperidol for delirium were included. Charts were evaluated using a predefined list of adverse events. Symptoms possibly related to haloperidol were evaluated for probability of causality using the Naranjo score, by two clinical pharmacologists and the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Institute (lareb.nl). Results: Fifty-two patients [median (range) age 10.6 (0. 3-18.8) years] received the drug for treatment of delirium. In six patients (11 %) seven adverse events were documented. These included extrapyramidal reactions (n = 2), extrapyramidal reactions + hyperpyrexia (n = 1), neuroleptic malignant syndrome (n = 1), long QT (n = 1), and isolated muscle rigidity (n = 1). Adverse events were rated as doubtful (n = 1), possible (n = 2), probable (n = 2) and definite (n = 1). The median (range) haloperidol dose was similar between patients with and without adverse events [0.03 (0.02-0.06) mg/kg/day vs 0.02 (0.003-0.08) mg/kg/day, p = 0.08]. Conclusion: To our knowledge this is the largest pediatric cohort studied for haloperidol-related adverse events. A significant proportion of patients develop adverse events. As haloperidol adverse events are correlated with dose in adults, our findings suggest that dosing in our pediatric population is suboptimal. Studies are needed to determine the optimal haloperidol dose for ICU delirium in children. Background and aim: Sugammadex is a new and novel agent that reverses muscle relaxation of the amino steroid neuromuscular blocking drugs (NMBD). Vecuronium is an amino steroid NMBD commonly used as an infusion in paediatric and neonatal intensive care units. Infants are at risk of prolonged effect due to the combination of low neonatal acetyl choline production, large volume of distribution and reduced excretion of the drug and its metabolites. Prolonged muscle relaxation may require a lengthened period of ventilation with an associated increase in morbidity. Currently there are no suitable agents available to reverse profound and prolonged muscle relaxation. Acetyl choline esterase inhibitors (AChEI) cannot be used until there is 75-80 % recovery in neuromuscular function. Significant stimulation at muscarinic receptors by AChEI's causes bradyarrhythmia, salivation and bronchoconstriction therefore need to be given with anticholinergic drugs which in turn can cause tachycardia's. Method: We describe the use of sugammadex in four neonates who received prolonged infusions of vecuronium following surgery and in whom the use of sugammadex immediately reversed the effects of profound muscle relaxation allowing weaning of ventilation and extubation. Conclusion: The use of sugammadex to reverse profound and prolonged neuromuscular block may reduce length of stay in the intensive care unit, morbidity of prolonged ventilation and be cost effective. Background and aims: About 50 % of the children with Down syndrome undergo surgery for congenital anomalies. They are often seen as more agitated but less sensitive for pain. The aim was to retrospectively and prospectively evaluate analgesia and sedation requirements in children with Down syndrome. Methods: Retrospective analysis of analgesia/sedation requirements and pain/distress scores in 15 children with Down syndrome and 30 without after surgery for congenital duodenal obstruction. Prospective analysis of analgesia/sedation requirements, pain/distress scores and morphine pharmacokinetics in 18 children with Down syndrome and 16 without after congenital heart surgery. Local ethics approval was obtained for both studies. Results: Both the retrospective and the prospective analysis did not show any differences in the pain scores of both groups. The percentage of scores indicating oversedation was 18 % in children with Down syndrome after cardiac surgery and 7 % in controls (P \\ 0.001). Analgesia and sedation requirements were comparable between both groups in the retrospective as well as the prospective analysis. Population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed no statistically significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters of morphine between the children with and without Down syndrome. Conclusion: Children with Down syndrome are not more agitated after surgery for congenital anomalies. There is no reason to adjust postoperative analgesia and sedation in these children. The next step is to develop and investigate evidence-based analgesia and sedation guidelines for children undergoing surgery for congenital anomalies. Objectives: Sedation is part of routine care in pediatric intensive care. In recent years, there is growing attention for the use of less sedatives, or daily interruption of sedation. In our perception, however, we used more sedatives over time. We therefore investigated trends in the use of sedatives in our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study in a PICU at an academic hospital in the Netherlands. All admissions between January 2003 and January 2012 were included. Length of stay in PICU and total number of ventilation days were compared with the pharmaceutical database of medication delivery. Results: A total 5,785 patients were admitted to the PICU during the years 2003-2012 with a mean of 643 patients per year. These patients received 26,713 days of mechanical ventilation. The use of benzodiazepines decreased significantly over the years from 92 mg per day of ventilation to 66 mg per day of ventilation (beta-coefficient -0.92, p = 0.01, R 2 0.84; Fig. 1 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 686, "end": 688, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 689, "end": 691, "text": "7,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 692, "end": 694, "text": "9,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 695, "end": 697, "text": "14", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 9485, "end": 9492, "text": "3-18.8)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 14613, "end": 14619, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "P.

Conclusions: Our findings show that in our PICU significantly less benzodiazepines have been used over time. There was no shift towards other types of sedatives. Background and aim: Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine and directly acts on targets in the central nervous system (CNS). The effect of midazolam in the CNS depends on the concentration of the drug at the site of action. Since there is no possibility of direct measurement of brain concentrations of drugs, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drug concentrations may be an alternative matrix. However, data on CSF pharmacokinetics are scarce. Our aim was to determine midazolam and metabolites concentrations in serum and CSF after rectal administration in children. Methods: Pediatric oncology patients (0-17 years) scheduled for lumbar puncture were included. During induction, midazolam 0.2-0.5 mg/ kg was administered rectally. Blood and CSF samples were drawn after administration. Midazolam and metabolites were determined by a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method. Results: 16 patients were included: 9 boys and 7 girls. Mean (SD) age was 7.6 (5.3) years. In 11 patients midazolam was found in CSF. The concentrations of midazolam in serum and CSF are shown in Table 1 . Valproic acid (VPA) is still an important antiepileptic drug with the broadest spectrum used in all types of seizures and syndromes. It has serious adverse effects such as hepatotoxicity, hyperammonemic encephalopathy, coagulation disorders and pancreatitis. The incidence of VPA-associated pancreatitis has been estimated to be 1:40,000. We present a 6-year-old boy who developed acute pancreatitis (AP) and multiple organ failure after 3 months of VPA therapy. Patient's laboratory values showed that his kidney and hepatic function had impaired and thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy had developed. Patient's abdominal tomography showed a suspected appearance which was consistent with pancreatitis. Since amylase and lipase levels were found to be high acute pancreatitis was considered. Patient improved after cessation of VPA treatment. Ten days later patient recovered both clinically and laboratorial. Consequently, patient was discharged with cure. In conclusion, AP is a rare, severe adverse reaction to VPA treatment. If a child who is receiving VPA, develops abdominal pain and vomits, VPA-associated pancreatitis must be considered. The aim of this study was to identify the incidence of lactic acidosis following salbutamol therapy and how this relates to patient characteristics (age, weight, ethnicity) Introduction: Craniofacial microsomia (CFM) is a congenital anomaly affecting the first and second pharyngeal arches and is characterized by asymmetric underdevelopment of the mandible, the maxilla, the ear and the soft tissues.

In four of these five children an obstructive sleep apnea syndrome was diagnosed (3 male, 1 female) (3 severe, 1 moderate). In 1 child central apnea syndrome was diagnosed.

Discussion: Literature review revealed only seven reports of bladder injury following attempts at direct UAC. The author found that in six of these instances urinary ascites were managed by surgical exploration, except in one case report making this the second case to be managed conservatively. We opted for conservative management because of significant improvement in the abdominal distension after urinary catheterisation and no significant bleeding from the tear, sepsis or bowel protrusion into the bladder.

Mortality has a biphasic pattern, 32 % (being 1 in 4). It is also important to note that interdisciplinary communication is required to further promote the survival prevalence. But the only possible strategy to reduce these risks and improve the quality of life is to promote a culture of prevention. Conclusions: Trauma-induced coagulopathy appears to occur predominantly in younger male patients and is strongly associated with a higher 28-day mortality. In 2009, we introduced a paediatric major haemorrhage protocol at our institution to facilitate the early correction of coagulopathy with a balanced ratio of blood products. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether this has subsequently improved morbidity and mortality in this population. We will report preliminary information on the implementation and results of this structured approach in our ECMOSim training. Conclusions: Burns are presented in a similar percentage of boys and girls, the etiology and age group was the most common in infants and scald, which is consistent with that reported nationally and globally. Mortality in this study agrees with our report. Burns are common in our environment in children due to lack of development in the culture of prevention, so the psychological, physical and family are more than 90 % of patients, leading to a poor quality of life.

The biggest fluid balance was observed on the first and second PICU day. The mean value of the fluid overload of those who expired was 14.9 % obtained from values that ranged from 3.8 to 31.2 %. Evidently the fluid overload of those who expired were much higher than those who improved. The result of the Chi square test indicate that the positive and negative fluid balance on the first 2 days at PICU are not significant together with the cumulative fluid balance. The fluid balance on the third and succeeding days and fluid overload showed significant results. Conclusion: There is no relationship on the cumulative fluid balance and outcome of critically ill pediatric patients. However, positive fluid balance on the third to succeeding days can have a poorer prognosis and negative fluid balance with a better prognosis. The fluid overload is a better predictor and has a greater impact in the outcome as compared to the cumulative fluid balance. Objectives: Current guidelines state that asphyxiated neonates should primarily be resuscitated with air ventilation. The minute ventilation with air or oxygen needed for restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was assessed. Method: Asphyxia was induced through hypoventilation, followed by apnea lasting until heart rate was\\50 bpm and mean arterial pressure was \\25 mmHg. Ventilation was then resumed and investigators, unaware of the composition or minute volume (MV) of inspired gas, gave closed chest cardiac massage. MV was varied between animals, and the one achieving ROSC by 10 min of resuscitation in 50 % of cases (Emv50) and the corresponding oxygen supply rate, Eosr50, were determined by fitting the parameters of the Hill equation to the observed dose-response. Results: Median arterial pH and BE were 6.68 and -18 mmol/L at the end of asphyxia induction. ROSC occurred in 12 of 32 piglets. Emv50 with air and oxygen was 10.9, and 3.4 mL/kg/min, respectively (SE of difference 1.8; p \\ 0.001). Eosr50 was 3.6 and 2.8 mL/ kg/min (not significant). Conclusion: The rates of oxygen supply, required for ROSC, were similar whether the oxygen was delivered to the lungs as a component of air or in pure form. Emv50 with air was a small fraction of normal minute ventilation. This supports the view that ventilation with air is usually sufficient in asphyxia. Backgrounds and aims: International guidelines recommend 10-12 breaths per minute (bpm) during advanced pediatric resuscitation. We hypothesize that this respiratory rate (RR) could be insufficient.

Our experience revealed delays in commencement of prostaglandin infusion. A survey of health professionals involved aided the introduction of a Yorkshire Neonatal Network and Yorkshire Paediatric Cardiology Network guideline regarding the use of Alprostadil in probable duct dependent congenital heart disease in Jan 2012. Objective: To audit the management of suspected duct dependent cardiac disease in the Yorkshire and Humber region. Methods: Prospective audit of all neonates transferred on prostaglandin infusion with no previous cardiac diagnoses between April 2011 and September 2012. Cases were identified from the Embrace [2] database and Echo diagnosis was confirmed from Leeds Paediatric Cardiology Department. Results: During the study period all 61 patients were transferred successfully by Embrace on prostaglandin infusion (no adverse side effects). 18 (25 %) patients presented in shock and 36 (61 %) patients were ventilated. However, only 9(50 %) of the shocked patients were started on the guideline recommended dose of prostaglandin. Overall 24 (39 %) patients were already started on prostaglandin at the time of referral and 9 of remaining 37 (24 %) patients had prostaglandin started in \\20 min. Since the introduction of regional guideline 59 % were already on prostaglandin at referral. Conclusion: Guideline introduction has led to a greater proportion of patients on prostaglandin infusion in suspected duct dependent lesion at referral.

Introduction: New videolaryngoscopes and other devices designed to facilitate tracheal intubation (TI) have been released, offering significant advantages in terms of efficacy and safety. Their role in practice is unknown. Advanced simulation could offer a preliminary tool to test new devices before their trial in real patients. Resident 0 s ability was tested for TI in infant and child manikins during continuous chest compressions (CC) with videolaryngoscope (Glidescope \u00d2 ). Methods: 23 residents trained on infant (SimBaby \u00d2 , Laerdal) and child intubation (Megacode Junior \u00d2 , Laerdal) manikins participated. TI was performed by both standard laryngoscopy (SL) and Glidescope \u00d2 while a colleague delivered continuous CC. Sequence of use of devices was randomized. Primary endpoints were the rate of successful placement of the tube in the trachea and the total TI time (TTI in seconds). Results: In infant scenario, the median (IQR) TTI was significantly shorter with ) s] than with Glidescope \u00d2 [38.0 (25.3-50.5) s] (p = 0.021). Participants who needed more than 30 s to intubate was also significantly higher with Glidescope (n = 13) than with SL (n = 7) (p = 0.01). In child scenario, the TTI [20.2 (18.6-25.1) vs. 22. 3 (19.8-28.6 ) s] and number of intubation failures (3 vs 4) were similar with SL and Glidescope \u00d2 laryngoscope. Discussion: Glidescope \u00d2 increases TTI when compared with SL and doubles the number of participants who would need more than 30 s to perform the procedure. Results with this device and SL are similar in child scenario. Testing with advanced simulation may be considered the first step in assessment of new medical devices. Background and aim: Postischemic hyperoxia promotes free-radical generated injury contributing to neurologic injury and cardiac dysfunction and is associated with increased mortality after cardiac arrest (CA). Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) has shown to improve neurological outcome after CA in adults and birth asphyxia. We aimed to determine whether hyperoxia was associated with increased in-hospital mortality in children treated with TH after CA. Staff may be first at the scene and required to help at road traffic accidents (RTAs). While staff are highly trained in neonatal and paediatric resuscitation of hospital patients, their training is not that of stabilisation in a field setting. We aimed to quantify the involvement of staff in unexpected incidents involving the public while on transport in order to analyse training gaps and ensure that safety for both staff and patients is maintained.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3221, "end": 3233, "text": "3 (19.8-28.6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3273, "end": 3281, "text": "(3 vs 4)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "-POSTER SESSION"}, {"text": "Methods: Retrospective analysis of incident reports and records from January 2010-January 2013.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "-POSTER SESSION"}, {"text": "Results: During the study period, 6,329 patients were transferred.

Objectives: In pediatric patients with cardiogenic shock (CS)/or acute cardiac failure (CF) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is often used as a bridging procedure to recovery or further implantation of an ventricular assist device (VAD). Although ECMO has been established as a routine procedure in pediatric tertiary care centers, the clinical pathway guiding these patients to fully recovery or further VAD implantation is one of the most challenging for pediatric intensivists. Methods: We describe the use of veno-arterial ECMO (VA-ECMO) as a treatment strategy for acute cardiac failure in spontaneously breathing and conscious pediatric patients. It presents our experiences with the first three children treated using this concept. The mean age of the patients was 2.4 months (range 0-5 months). Mean amount of time on ECMO was 47.7 days (range 6.9-94.2 days). Results: One patient fully recovered with his cardiac function while being treated on ''Awake-VA-ECMO'', one was bridged to LVAD and one was successfully bridged to transplantation. Two of the three patients are alive without any recurrences. One patient died prior to further heart transplantation while being on intracardiac rotation pump. Although reintubation was necessary in two of our patients (due to interventional heart catheter) total time breathing sponteanously and being conscious while on ECMO was [80 %. Conclusion: We conclude that the concept of ''Awake VA-ECMO'' is feasible and safe for the treatment of acute cardiac failure and can be used as a ''bridging strategy'' to recovery or further VAD implantation in pediatric patients.

Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) is a ventilation mode which uses electrical activity of a diaphragm to control ventilation. NAVA may be used both as an invasive and non-invasive ventilation and it helps to provide ventilation suited to a patient's needs and to wean a patient from mechanical ventilation gradually, in the way controlled by the patient himself. The authors present eight preterm infants ventilated using invasive and noninvasive NAVA. The mean corrected gestational age was 28 weeks (minimum 25, maximum 31) and the mean birth weight was 1,162 g (minimum 740 g, maximum 1,500 g). Four neonates were diagnosed with congenital infection. Six preterm infants were successfully ventilated and weaned using NAVA and NIV NAVA and in two cases ventilation mode had to be changed because of multiple central apneas. NAVA may be a useful ventilatory tool that helps to achieve gradual transition from invasive mechanical ventilation, through non-invasive ventilatory support to spontaneous breathing.

Nine patients were included, mean age was 14 months (IQR 1.6-177). RCP duration was 34 \u00b1 17 min and the gap between RCP and the start of hypothermia was 3.7 \u00b1 1.6 h.

At 3 months follow-up, Paediatric Cerebral Performance Category score was B2 in four patients. Due to lacking evidence and protocols, TH after paediatric CA is not widely used.

However, the proportion of children referred for critical illness requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and/or circulatory support has not changed suggesting that the increased activity is not due to a change in referral patterns. .

Patients requiring PICU stay [7 days, correlation was found between PICU-stay and MV need (r = 0.98, p = 0.0001). Seven patients showed evidence of ALI/ARDS and five underwent severe sepsis/ septic shock. Patients admitted to burn unit had median age 22 months (IQR 15-31), median stay 6 days (IQR 3-11), median BA 6.75 % (IQR 4-13). Despite children represented 25 % of total burned patients in recent literature, few data are available on intensive care of children with severe burns, but a worse outcome was suggested for children admitted to adult facilities. This 2-years experience illustrates potential advantages of a cooperation between a burn unit and a tertiary referral PICU in the management of infants with severe burns. Introduction: Cardiac arrest is a clinical event that can occur suddenly, often without premonitory signs. Outcome of CPR is dependent on many factors, the site of event, quality of CPR, whether the event was witnessed, time to basic life support, time to advanced life support and initial rhythm. Purpose: To determine the outcome of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in PICU and factors associated with unfavorable outcome. Methods: retrospective study of children with cardiac arrest and required CPR in PICU over a period from January to December 2010. Two outcome variables were measured (ROSC) and survival to discharge from PICU. Results: 700 PICU admission, a total of 172 (24.6 %) patients developed cardiac arrest that required CPR. ROSC was achieved in 78 cases (45.3 %), 25 patients (14.5 %) survived to discharge and 94 patients (54.7 %) did not respond to resuscitations. Success and survival were significantly higher in cases resuscitated for B20 min than [20 min (100 and 33.3 % vs. 32.4 and 10.1 % respectively). Success and survival were better for mechanical ventilation than those were not (48.1 and 17.8 % vs. 37.2 and 4.7 % respectively). Defibrillation was successful in 10 cases (25 %) and survival was in 1 case (0.5 %) and out of survivors 80 % had good neurological outcome. Conclusion: The frequency of cardiac arrest needed CPR was recorded in 24.6 %. Improving the quality of CPR is an important factor to improve the outcome by implementing training programs.

Conclusion: Eight-year-old neonatal ECMO survivors have a higher prevalence of impaired motor performance (mainly children with CDH and PPHN) and decreased exercise capacity. Motor performance and exercise capacity correlate. Despite of impaired motor performance, results of m-CBSK suggest that these children feel satisfied with their motor performance. 50 -ORAL PRESENTATION POSTNATAL DEPRESSION AND PRETERM BIRTH.

Panov 2 1 UGD-Stip, Faculty of Medical Sciences-Stip, 2 UGD-Stip, FMN-Stip, Kocani, FYROM-The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Background: The disease burden of seasonal influenza in the pediatric population is generally attributed to a combination of immunologic naivety, prolonged virus shedding, and enhanced transmission opportunity in child-care and educational institutions. Aim: To describe the clinical characteristics of children hospitalized with 2009 influenza A H1N1 infection in General Hospital of Stip. Methods: We reviewed the medical reports of 11 children with pandemic H1N1 Influenza A hospitalized to the pediatric clinic of General Hospital of Stip. Between March to December 2012.Material: All patients were laboratory-confirmed with 2012 influenza A (H1N1).The most frequent clinical presentations were influenzalike illness and wheezing exacerbation. Predisposing underlying illnesses were detected in three of the patients who have viral-induced asthma. Pneumonia diagnosed in three of all patients of whom two had a history of viral-induced asthma and the third was infant. More than two-thirds received treatment of antiviral or antibacterial or combination of antiviral and antibacterial. The median length of stay in hospital was 2.6 days. None of the children died or need admission in intensive care unit. Conclusions: Despite the fact that 2012 outbreak of Influenza H1NI did not cause serious disease or complications in pediatric population of Macedonia, the clinicians should maintain a high suspicion in children with febrile respiratory illness and promptly treat those with underlying risk factors.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF59": {"text": "CONTINUOUS VENO-VENOUS HEMOFILTRATION IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HAND-FOOT-MOUTH DISEASE-RELATED FULMINANT CARDIOPULMONARY FAILURE P.H.

The most important factor of improving survival in sepsis is early diagnostics. The aim was to reveal diagnostic possibilities of inflammatory cytokines in children with sepsis. Materials and methods: In this prospective study(1.10.2010- 1.10.2011) we included patients with SIRS and sepsis, based on the International Consensus Conference(2002)criteria. Levels of CRP, procalcitonin, IL-6, and experimental cytokine panels were measured (Luminex-200, Millipore) at inclusion, after 24 h, and at discharge. Results: In total, 24 patients were included. On inclusion the median level of CRP was 150.25 mg/l, median procalcitonin level-3.06 pg/ml, and median IL-6-101.35 pg/ml. Statistically significant differences between the inclusion and compared levels after 24 h were detected in granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (p = 0.006) and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecules (sVCAM-1) (p = 0.05). Differences between the inclusion and discharge were seen in TNFa (p = 0.05), IFNc (p = 0.05), IL-10 (p = 0.003), G-CSF (p = 0.003), IFN inducible protein-10 (IP-10) (p = 0.004), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) (p = 0.028), macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) (p = 0.034), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1 total) (p = 0.01), sVCAM-1 (p = 0.006). Conclusions: TNFa, IFNc, IL-10, G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIF, PAI-1, sVCAM-1 could be used for early diagnostic of sepsis. G-CSF and sVCAM-1 needs to be investigated as markers of therapeutic efficacy in children with sepsis.

Methods: The ethical issues raised, relevant guidelines and previous research papers around the topic were studied and considered. Time was spent observing clinicians and discussing their thoughts and deliberations, attending MDT meetings and ethics committee meetings to discuss particular cases. A comprehensive case study of one particular child where WWLST was considered and undertaken was conducted. Results: There were 5 children in whom withdrawal of futile care was considered. The essential factors considered were futility of treatment, reversibility of pathology, parental wishes and, most importantly, the child's best interests.

Conclusions: Whilst WWLST forms a significant part of practice on PICU, many children are kept alive for days or weeks despite irreversible pathology. Doctors are trained to sustain life, but more paediatric training in medical ethics and WWLST ought to be undertaken.

At the same time, the incidence of children with comorbidities increased: children with severe congenital or acquired diseases have a longer survival rate and represent an increasing percentage of patients admitted in PICU. Aim of this study is to evaluate incidence and describe chronic children admitted in Italian PICUs along 2 years. Methods: All children admitted in 13 Italian PICUs in 2011 and 2012 were enrolled in the study. Beyond anagraphic and descriptive data children were divided in previously healthy or chronic if a comorbidity affected the patient on admission. Comorbidity was defined as the presence of a disease lasting at least for 6 months conditioning repetitive hospital admissions and/or a limitation in everyday life. Results: Overall, 4,045 children were enrolled in the study which accounted for 4,578 number of PICU admissions. There was an increment of comorbid children from 41.8 % to 44.8 mainly affected by neurologic disease and it was observed in almost all the units and in all age categories. Length of stay and mortality was significantly higher in chronic than in healthy children. Readmission rate for chronic ranged between 8 and 13 %. Conclusion: Children with comorbidities represent an increasing part of PICU admissions. They account for almost 65 % of PICU days. Social-economics relapse and cost-effectiveness analysis should be considered in order to be able to afford for all the needs in the future. THE RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY OF TURKISH VERSION OF WHAT BEING THE PARENT OF A BABY IS LIKE SCALE D. Yildiz, Y.

This study is planned for quantification of validity and confidence of ''What Being the Parent of a Baby is Like (WPL)'' scale in Turkish primipara mothers who have healthy, full-term infants. Study is composed by the 81 mothers. The scale was created by Karen Pridham, administrated to the mothers at the end of 1st week, 1st month and 3rd month. A questionnaire of socio-demographic aspects of mothers and ''What Being the Parent of a Baby is Like'' scale were used for the collection of the data. Cronbach alpha coefficients which were collected from subscale are ranged between 10.13 and 82.07. Cronbach's alpha coefficients for administration of at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months postpartum were at 0.87 on Evaluation, 0.68 on Centrality, and 0.75 on Life Change.

Amado, M. Costa, J. Rios, L. Boto, C. Camilo, F. Abecasis, M. Vieira Hospital de Santa Maria, Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Norte, Lisbon, PortugalBackground: Immunodepressed patients have a higher risk of sepsis, which is related with high morbidity and mortality. Yet, early institution of antibiotic therapy and quick transfer to an intensive care unit has increased survival rate. Aims: Characterize the immunodepressed patients with severe sepsis admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of the Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Norte. Methods: Retrospective and descriptive study of the medical records of children admitted with severe sepsis from January 1st 2009 till December 31st 2012. Results: A total of 57 children with severe sepsis were admitted, 25 were immunodepressed (18 with malignancies, 7 with primary immunodeficiency, 10 had previously received a bone marrow transplant), 16 were in bone marrow aplasia. Median age was 9 years (10 months-17 years) and 56 % were male. Average PRISM was 15. The causative agent was isolated in 12 patients (48 %), mostly bacteria isolated from blood. All patients needed fluid bolus and 21 needed vasoactive and/or inotropic drugs. Nine patients underwent hydrocortisone therapy. Twenty children had two or more organ-failure. Twelve children were ventilated (average 7 days), seven non-invasively and four needed renal replacement therapy. Six patients needed parenteral nutrition. The median length of PICU stay was 7 days(3-41 days). Mortality rate was 28 %. Comments: Immunodepressed patients, when compared to immunocompetent ones, have more severe forms of sepsis, with higher rates of multi-organ failure and mortality. Despite the clinical severity, the survival rate sustains the significant therapeutic investment in these patients.K. Amer 1 , R. Basu Roy 2 , R. Parslow 3 , T. McShane 3 , S. Nadel 2 Background: Developed countries exhibit higher rates of PICU admission and case fatalities in male infants compared to females(Scott Watson et al., Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 2003). Contrastingly, in addition to the disease-specific protection vaccination offers, observational studies and randomised trials in developing countries have indicated possible non-specific effects of such vaccines, particularly in females(Aaby et al., PIDJ, 2007). Specifically, the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine has been associated with increased morbidity in females(Agergaard et al., Vaccine,  2011). Aims: To understand whether this phenomenon is pertinent in the developed world, we hypothesised that non-specific vaccine effects would be demonstrated by differences in gender mortality and admission to PICU in infants with life-threatening infection. Method: UK PICANET admissions data between January 2005 and January 2012 yielded 48,763 males and females \\1 year of age. Mortality between genders was risk adjusted using the paediatric index of mortality 2 (PIM2). Statistical analysis was conducted using the Pearson's Chi squared model to achieve probability values. Results: Crude and adjusted mortality was increased in females under 12-months-old in comparison to males. The risk adjusted OR is 1.18 (1.08-1.29; p \\ 0.001) using PIM2. This appears strongest in children with a respiratory diagnosis, where the OR is 1.48 (1.2-1.82; p \\ 0.001). Conclusion: Primary analysis suggests clear gender differences in mortality. These differences relate to respiratory, as apposed to other infectious diagnoses. Further analysis of the data, focusing on immunization status is warranted.221 -POSTER SESSIONRAPID REMOVAL OF MYOGLOBIN WITH THE HCO 1100 FILTER IN 5 CHILDREN WITH RHABDOMYOLYSIS O. Amon, E. Heimberg, I. Gerbig, M. Kumpf, H. Billing, C. FinkUniversity Children's Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, GermanyThe High CuT Off (HCO) 1100 Dialysis filter for elimination of light chains in multiple myeloma is able to remove plasma components up to 45 kDa. Myoglobin (Molecular weight 17.8 kDa) may lead to rhabdomyolysis-associated renal failure. We have treated five children with rhabdomyolysis with the HCO filter. Cause of rhabdomyolysis were trauma, infection and multiorgan failure (n = 1 each) and severe limb ischemia (n = 2). The four boys and one girl were 2-15 years old with a body weight of 11-60 kg. Mean initial myoglobin value was 43.227 (range 1.876-102.300) lg/L. The patients were treated for 12 h with the HCO filter, followed by conventional CVVH. At the end of the 12-h HCO treatment period the myoglobin values had decreased to a mean of 12.250 (range 396-42.000) lg/L. Additional 2 HCO treatments for 12 h each were performed in two and an additional one HCO treatment was performed in one patient-each treatment followed by 12 h of conventional CVVH. After this second or third HCO treatment course the myoglobin values had dropped to 927, 983 and 1.483 lg/L. During the 12 hperiods of conventional CVVH the myoglobin values did not decrease. Four children survived, one child died from multiorgan failure. Dialysis treatment could be discontinued in the survivors within a mean of 6 days after HCO treatment (range 1-14 days). In our experience HCO filter treatment is superior to all other treatments used to remove myoglobin in childhood rhabdomyolysis. Human albumin substitution is necessary.Deparment of Paediatrics, Stanger Hospital, Stanger, South AfricaTB is the number one cause of death in children with HIV in subsaharan Africa. In the last three decade TB cases rates have increased dramatically in countries with high HIV prevalence. In South Africa alone 16 % of children accounts for all TB cases of which 25-60 % are HIV co-infected. Actual TB rates are much higher and have been under-reported in public health system. Problems in detection and difficulties in diagnosis in children pose some challenges. The most widely used method of TB testing, the sputum smear, and show false negative in 87 % of the cases. Overlapping lung diseases (pneumonia, bronchiactasis) in HIV-positive children often lead to diagnostic error or delayed diagnosis of TB resulting in high infant mortality rate. This challenge is further compounded by the Multi Drug Resistant (MDR) strain of the disease. In 2010, The World Health Organization (WHO) endorsed PCR assay based diagnostic tools for TB such as Gene Xpert and MDR/RIP for children. These are more reliable diagnostic tools which results obtained within hours. In Paediatric patients evolution showed Gene Xpert detected twice as many cases (75.9 %) as smear (38 %). Unfortunately these are still not widely available owing to high cost. Research, funding and trained personnel is needed for improving the diagnosis and treatment of smear-negative TB in children. Collaboration is required between public and private sectors battle this pandemic disease. TB is a multisystem disease and is correlated to HIV. If the HIV can be controlled, TB will controlled.ASYMMETRIC DIMETHYLARGININE AND L-ARGININE LEVELS IN NEONATAL SEPSIS AND SEPTIC SHOCK O. Aydemir, B. Ozcan, H. Yucel, A.Y. Bas, N.

Deep 7 Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Great North Children's Hospital, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Cardiac Intensive Care Unit, Great Ormond St Hospital, Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, King's College Hospital, London, UKAnimal studies demonstrate that fever in infected animals is associated with decreased mortality. Fever in adult ICU patients with infection is also associated with a lower mortality. It is not know whether this is the case in critically ill children. We hypothesize that children in PICU with suspected infection who are febrile have a decreased mortality. Prospectively collected data from unselected admissions to five UK PICUs were pooled. Data was obtained for 471 patients, ages 0-16. Data described patient demographics, maximum temperature in 1st 24 h of ICU stay, clinically suspected infection and survival before discharge from ICU. Patients with suspected infection had a higher maximum temperature within the 1 st 24 h of ICU stay compared with patients where infection was not suspected (Mean Temperature 38.1 vs 37.6\u00b0C p \\ 0.001). The odds of death for patients with suspected infection who had temperatures C37.8 vs \\37.8\u00b0C was 0.35 (95 % CI 0.1-1.1).

This study did not demonstrate an association between decreased mortality and pyrexia in PICU patients with suspected infection. Variability in methods of temperature measurement, subjective assessment of suspected infection and the use of antipyretics and therapeutic cooling introduce noise into the sample. Further prospective work is needed, with standardized temperature measurement, greater patient numbers, consistency in assessment of infection, longer follow up and adjustment for illness severity.PROCALCITONIN (PCT), C REACTIVE PROTEIN (CRP) AND LACTATE IN PREDICTING MORTALITY, SEPTIC SHOCK AND THE STRATIFICATION OF SEPSIS R.

Methods: Prospective study in 81 patients. Plasma levels of PCT, CRP and lactate were measured at admission in the PICU. Patients were categorized into systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock. In contrast to CRP and lactate, the determination of PCT in PICU admission is a good predictor of mortality and septic shock and can stratify patients according to severity of sepsis.CRIMEANCONGO HEMORRHAGIC FEVER IN IRANIAN CHILDREN, A CLINICAL AND PARACLINICAL APPROACH S. Chinikar, N. Shah-Hosseini, S. Khakifirouz, T. Jalali, B. Moghassemi Arboviruses and Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers Laboratory (National Ref. Lab), Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran, Iran Introduction: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tickborne zoonotic disease caused by a single-stranded RNA virus belongs to the Nairovirus genus from Bunyaviridea family. CCHFV is transmitted by tick bite or by direct contact with blood or tissues of infected livestock or nosocomialy. Method: To diagnose CCHF in Iranian children, 529 sera samples were gathered from probable patients under 18 years old (aged 1-18) from different provinces of Iran during 2000-2012, molecular (RT-PCR) and serological (IgM, IgG) tests were applied. Results: Among 529 suspected cases for CCHF, 23 % (126 cases) were IgM and/or RT-PCR positive and 19 cases were died. Among positive cases, boys with 67 % (85 cases) were the dominant gender. Fever with 96 % (123 cases), haemorrhagic with 35 % (45 cases) and myalgia with 23 % (30 cases) were dominant clinical findings. The laboratory experiments also showed thrombocytopenia in 96 % (123) of cases and leucopenia in 18 % (23) of cases.Conclusion: Interestingly, the majority of confirmed cases were boy, which seems due to boys implication in high risk professions related to infected livestock such as slaughtering in rural areas. Concerning clinical approach, data demonstrated that fever, haemorrhage and myalgia were ranked among the most common clinical symptoms in children patients, respectively.

Gowda, B. Jenkins, A. Coe Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, University Hospital of Coventry and Warwickshire, Coventry, UKBackground and aims: Central catheters such as umbilical venous catheters (UVC), umbilical arterial catheters (UAC) and percutaneous long lines (LL) are routinely inserted in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU). These catheters may become colonised or act as foci for sepsis. At removal it is a common practice in many NICUs to send tips routinely for bacterial culture and sensitivity. We examined the bacteriology associated with catheter tips after removal. Methods: Retrospective observational study in UK tertiary NICU of all indwelling catheters removed from April 2012 to Sept 2012. All UVC, UAC and LL tips sent for culture during the 6-month period were analysed. Results: 137 tips were sent during study period of which 10 % (14) had positive growth:Of the six true positive cases, five babies were well, so no action was taken. In the 6th antibiotics started previously for suspected line infection continued. Conclusions: The positive culture rate (excluding skin contamination) in all type of catheter/line tips was 4 %. Sending line tips for culture in unwell babies, or when line infection is suspected, is more useful than sending routinely in well babies.OBSERVATIONAL STUDY OF ROUTINE ENDOTRACHEAL TIP CULTURING IN NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNITH. Gowda, B. Jenkins, A. CoeNeonatal Intensive Care Unit, University Hospital of Coventry and Warwickshire, Coventry, UK Background and aims: Endotracheal (ET) tubes are routinely used for intubation in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU). These tubes may become colonised or act as foci for respiratory infection/sepsis. At removal it is a common practice in many NICUs to send tips routinely for culture and sensitivity. We examined the bacteriology associated with ET tube tips after removal. Methods: Retrospective observational study in UK tertiary NICU of all ET tube tips from April 2012 to Sept 2012. All ET tube tips sent for culture during the 6 month period were analysed. Results: 110 ET tube tips were sent during study period. 28 (25 %) had a positive culture. There were multiple tips from same patient, which grew the same bacterial growth because of colonisation.In rest of the nine patients only a single tip was sent which grew respiratory commensals and CONS. None of the positive cultures led to antibiotic prescription. Most of the positive ET-tube tips were due to colonisation. None of them warranted antibiotic prescription. Sending routine ET-tube tips for culture is not beneficial. Endotracheal secretions for culture may be more useful if there is clinical concern of respiratory infection in ventilated neonates.DOES UTILIZATION OF NYSTATIN PROPHYLAXIS CAUSEINCREASED FREQUENCY OF INFECTIONS BY RESISTANT CANDIDA SUBSPECIES IN VERY LOW BIRTH WEIGHT INFANTS?

Howes, S. Mittal, M. Duthie, P. Barry, A. Vora Department of Children's Intensive Care, University Hospitals of Leicester, Leicester, UKObjectives: VAP is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, increasing duration of hospital stay and resource utilisation. Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) guidance highlights the gold standard of Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) in diagnosing VAP, followed by antibiotic duration of 5-7 days treatment. Prevention measures of hand hygiene, semi-recumbent bed position, daily sedation interruption, gastro prophylaxis, verification of NG tube position and regular antiseptic mouthcare are recommended. The audit aims were to identify the incidence of VAP in our unit and assess whether CDC management recommendations were adhered to. Methods: We performed a retrospective audit over two consecutive winters (October to February 2010/11 and 2011/12,) identifying patients in whom samples for BAL and Endotracheal aspirate (ETA) had been taken, reviewing case notes to identify clinical, radiological and laboratory criteria for VAP and assessing whether CDC recommendations were followed. Results: 402 patients were admitted to CICU during these periods.Conclusions: VAP has an incidence of 7 % in our hospital. We have since changed our mouthcare policy in line with CDC recommendations and are formulating a VAP guideline, reiterating the importance of admission and repeat BAL with clinical change.

Umar, M. Charanchi Federal Medical Centre Gombe, Gombe, Nigeria Background/aims: Despite advances in perinatal care, Neonatal sepsis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the tropics. It accounts for 30-70 % of neonatal mortality. Delay in diagnosis and treatment results in poor outcome; surveillance identifies common pathogens thus guiding empiric therapy. This review describes pathogens in neonatal sepsis in our facility. Methods: A retrospective review of blood culture reports from January 2008-December 2012 of newborns admitted into the SCBU of the Federal Medical Centre Gombe was conducted. Information regarding age, sex and isolates were analysed. The average yearly admission is 650 neonates. Results: 2,114 blood cultures were analysed and these constituted 40 % (2,114/5,276) of all childhood blood cultures.

SENSITIVITY OF TORCH SCREEN VS URINE FOR CMV IN DIAGNOSING INTRAUTERINE INFECTION IN MIDWESTERN REGION A. Ismail, A.M. Murphy, S. Qadri, C. SreenanPaediatrics, Mid Western Regional Hospital University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF88": {"text": "Introduction: The TORCH screening is a blood tests that is used to check for several different infections in a newborn. TORCH stands for toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, and HIV. A diagnosis of congenital CMV infection can be made by seeing the virus in an infant's urine.Congenital CMV cannot be diagnosed if the infant is tested more than one week after birth. The yield and costs of TORCH screen may not be justifiable. Aim: The aim of the study is to determine the number of congenital infections detected in Midwestern region with the current use of the TORCH screen Vs urine for CMV. Methods: A review of all TORCH screen results and urine for CMV results were undertaken in a 10 year period from January 2002 to December 2012 by serology laboratory results with subsequent review of relevant medical charts. Canvasing the neonatologist about the babies admitted under their care. Results: During this period there where 54,231 live births out of which 2,964 babies were born below tenth centile out of that 419 with symmetrical IUGR for which TORCH screen was sent and only five are positive that is 1.1 % of the total blood test and in comparison to that only 77 urine test was sent for CMV and 17 are positive that is 20 % of the total test. Conclusion: The yield and costs of TORCH screen may not be justifiable but CMV diagnosis can only be made if the virus is detected in infants urine during the first week of life.242 -POSTER SESSIONANTIMICROBIAL POLICY IN NEONATAL SEPSIS: EXPERIENCE OF A REGIONAL LEVEL THREE NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT S. Jayachandran 1 , S. Shankar 1 , V. Laza-Stanca 2 Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, 2 Department of Microbiology, University Hospital of North Staffordshire, Stoke-on-Trent, UK Background: Prompt treatment of neonatal sepsis is paramount; however, inappropriate antibiotic usage could be harmful. Our first-line antibiotics are benzylpenicillin + gentamicin for 'early onset sepsis' (EOS) and flucloxacillin + gentamicin for 'late onset sepsis' (LOS). Aim: To identify 1. Bacterial spectrum causing neonatal sepsis and their antibiotic susceptibilities 2. Appropriateness of local antimicrobial policy for sepsis 3. Whether blood culture's time to positivity can guide antibiotic duration. Methods: Retrospective cohort study involving all positive bacterial blood cultures between July 2010 and June 2012. Demographics, clinical features and microbiological reports were analysed. Time to positivity's significance calculated using 'Receiver operating characteristics' (ROC) Results: 99 episodes of positive blood cultures from 67 neonates included (median gestation age 27 + 4 weeks, median birth weight 1,045 g). EOS and LOS accounted for 14 and 86 %, respectively. Common EOS pathogens (E. coli/GBS) were susceptible to benzylpenicillin + gentamicin combination. CONS were commonest LOS pathogen (69 %). All CONS isolated were susceptible to vancomycin, only 3 % susceptible to flucloxacillin/gentamicin. Five deaths were reported, two relating to CONS sepsis. As assessed by ROC, 36 h cut-off value has high specificity (98.5 %) and very low sensitivity (8.5 %) for significantly positive blood cultures. Conclusion: Existing EOS antibiotic policy was appropriate; policy for LOS needs revision to provide appropriate cover for CONS sepsis. Cutoff value of 36 h can be safely used to support decision to stop antibiotics. 243 -POSTER SESSION HEMOFILTRATION DOES NOT DECREASE THE MAGNITUDE OF SIRS DURING ECMO IN NEWBORNS B. Kapitein 1 , K.

Blijdorp K, Cransberg K, Wildschut ED et al (2009) Critical Care 13(R48):1-7. Background: The optimal management of pregnancies complicated by PPROM remains undefined and is area of great controversy in obstetrics. There are two options for managing PPROM: expectant management (EM) or early planned birth (Induction of labour = IL). Our protocol include EM of PPROM, prophylactic antibiotics, tocolytic, and corticosteroids in PPROM \\34 weeks GA. GA [34 weeks management is still in discussion. Objective: To determinate infections neonatal incidence related time of gestacional age to delivery. Materials and methods: Prospective study during 2009-2012. All pregnancies complicated to PPROM [18 h had screening for sepsis and we sign obstetrical management of PPROM. All pregnancies in our study was hospitalised and all womens had standardized treatment. Neonate was monitored for clinical and laboratory index of infection. Results: From January 2009-December 2012, 1.66 of pregnancies result complicated to PPROM [18 h. Incidence of neonatal infection was 17.64 %. Infection was cause of death in 23.3 % of neonates aged \\35 weeks and the prematurity is still the most important cause of deaths in this group. We found 8.7 % infection in EM group vs 6.09 % to the IL group, but not significant difference. Discussion: Decision for un expectant management related to early planned birth is un balance to different factors that include GA, wellbeing of mother and fetus. EM is justified in GA \\34 weeks rerlated to high rate of morbidity/mortality in this GA. IL for GA [34 weeks can reduce infection risk.

In the last century was the most common infectious complication located within the burned area. The incidence of infectious complications in the burned area, thanks to early necrectomy methods and subsequent autotransplantation resulting defect significantly reduced. Nevertheless, it is still significant complications for our patients. Materials and methods: The study included a total of 97 children with thermal trauma hospitalized in ICU in 2006-2009. These patients were monitored regularly microbiological situation not only in the burned areas. Microbiological surveillance in burned areas was performed using swabs and smears. Results: The average age of the group was 2.72, with an average range of burnt areas was 16.25 % TBSA (total body surface area). The overall average length of hospital stay was 19.10 days. We have a total of 1,157 bacterial strains isolated. The most frequently isolated bacteria were coagulase negat. staphylococci (40.02 %), Bacillus sp.

Pons-Odena 1 , A. Medina 2 , D. Vila 1 , L. Rodriguez 1 , F.J. Cambra 1 PICU, Hospital Sant Joan de De\u00b4u, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, 2 PICU, Hospital Central de Asturias, Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, SpainObjectives: To identify predictive factors of failure for non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in initial NIV (i-NIV) in children with acute respiratory failure (ARF). Patients and methods: Prospective cohort study with consecutive sampling of patients treated on NIV for ARF admitted toPICU  between 2005 and 2009. Patients with previous intubation during admission or those with palliative indication for NIV were excluded. Patient's demographic data, physiologic data (including SpO 2 /FiO 2 (SF) ratio) previous, at 2, 8, 12 and 24 h were collected. NIV failure, defined as need for intubation, was the primary outcome. Descriptive, Uni-Multivariate statistic analysis was performed (Binary Logistic and Cox Regression). Results: The sample consists of 282 patients. 182 male (64.5 %). CI 1.008-1.034) and patients treated with CPAP showed a higher risk of failure compared to bilevel (BLPAP)(OR 7.8;). Higher SF ratio values at 2 h showed a decreased risk for NIV failure (OR 0.991; 95 % CI 0.986-0.996. Conclusion: Age below 6 months, being treated with CPAP instead of BLPAP, lower SF ratio, higher IPAP and higher HR values at 2 h are predictive factors for NIV failure in initial NIV. IS SpO 2 /FiO 2 (SF) RATIO BETTER PREDICTOR OF NIV FAILURE THAN TYPE I/II RESPIRATORY FAILURE? M. Pons-Odena 1 , A. Medina 2 , V. Modesto 3 , A. Felipe 1 , F.J. Cambra 1 PICU, Hospital Sant Joan de De\u00b4u. Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, 2 PICU, Hospital Central de Asturias. Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, 3 PICU, Hospital La Fe, Valencia, Spain Background: In previous studies, Respiratory failure type I (hypoxemic patients) has been identified as a predictive factor of NIV failure. Objectives: To compare the value of different predictive failure factors for non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in children with acute respiratory failure (ARF). Patients and methods: Prospective cohort study with consecutive sampling of patients treated on NIV for ARF admitted to PICU between 2005 and 2009. Patients with palliative indication for NIV were excluded. Patient's demographic data, type of RF (I/II), physiologic data (including SpO 2 /FiO 2 ratio (SF)) previous, at 2, 8, 12 and 24 h were collected. NIV failure, defined as need for intubation, was the primary outcome. Descriptive, Uni-and Multivariate statistic analysis was performed. Results: The sample consists of 491 patients (156 type I and 335 type II). 310 were male (63.25 %). NIV failure occurs in 23 % (type I RF) (95 %CI 16-30 %), 33 % (type II RF) (95 %CI 28-38 %). Lower SF ratio values at 2 h showed an increased risk of NIV failure (Odds ratio (OR) 0.994; 95 % CI 0.990-0.997). Being younger than 6 months old also increased risk of NIV failure (OR 2.1; 95 % CI 1.27-3.6) and patients treated with CPAP showed a higher risk of failure compared to bilevel (BLPAP) (OR 2.5; 95 % CI 1.4-4.5). RF Type I/II was excluded from the model. Conclusion: In our population type II RF has greater failure rate than type I RF. Lower SF ratio at 2 h seems to be better predictive factor of NIV failure than Respiratory failure type I/II. 486 -POSTER SESSION WHAT ARE THE CRITERIA USED IN CLINICAL PRACTICE TO INITIATE NONINVASIVE VENTILATORY ASSISTANCE IN CHILDREN WITH SEVERE BRONCHIOLITIS?

Methods: All children admitted to PCCU-ICU, during 2011/2012 epidemic for severe bronchiolitis requiring ventilatory assistance were included. We asked caregivers to fulfill standardized questionnaires collecting prospectively clinical, biological and radiological criteria.Results: Among the 128 children included, 91 were treated by HFC, 34 received nCPAP and 3 NIPPV. 46 children failed to HFC: one death, 4 secondary treated by NIPPV (one failure) and 41 by nCPAP (9 failures treated by NIPPV with one subsequent failure). Among the 15 children with nCPAP failure one was intubated, 14 were put on NIPPV (one failure). Five (4 %) children were finally intubated. nCPAP group had a lower weight (3.7 vs 4.0 kg, p \\ 0.05), presented more apneas (32.3 vs 16.5 %, p = 0.05) and more neurological signs (36.4 vs 13.5 %, p \\ 0.01) compared to HFC group. Hypercapnic acidosis was similar between the two groups. The 30 children requiring NIPPV had a median age of 28 days (18-56), had fre-Noninvasive ventilatory technics allowed to avoid intubation. Children with low weight, apneas and neurological symptoms were more frequently treated by nCPAP than by HFC. NIPPV can be used when children failed, even for the youngest with apnea and severe hypercapnic acidosis. To determine exact indication of each technic comparative studies are required.RESPIRATORY SUPPORT IN RETRIEVALS OFCRITICALLY ILL INFANTS: HIGH-FLOW NASAL PRONG THERAPY IS SAFE AND MAY REDUCE INTUBATION RATES L. Schlapbach 1,2 , J. Schaefer 1 , A.-M. Brady 1 , S. Mayfield 1 , A. Schibler 1 Paediatric Critical Care Research Group, Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Mater Children's Hospital, Brisbane, QLD, Australia, Neonatal and Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Department of Pediatrics, University of Berne, Bern, SwitzerlandBackground: Optimal respiratory support for interhospital transport of critically ill children represents a challenge. High flow nasal prong (HFNP) therapy has emerged as a promising support mode in PICU patients, but no data are available on HFNP use in retrievals. We aimed to assess safety of HFNP during retrievals of critically ill children and its impact on need for invasive ventilation (IV). Methods: Retrospective study including infants B2 years transported by a paediatric retrieval team to the tertiary PICU between 2005 and 2012. Comparison of IV rates before(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008) and after introduction of HFNP(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012). Results: 793 infants were retrieved. The mean transport duration was 1.4 h (range 15 min-8 h), with a mean distance of 205 km (2-2,856). Before introduction of HFNP, 7 % (n = 23) were retrieved on noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and 49 % (n = 163) on IV. After introduction of HFNP, 33 % (n = 150) were retrieved on HFNP, 2 % (n = 10) on NIV, whereas IV decreased to 35 % (n = 162, Chi square p \\ 0.001). In patients retrieved on HFNP, none required intubation during retrieval, and none developed pneumothorax or cardiac arrest. The rate of retrieved infants requiring intubation for respiratory reasons during the first 24 h after PICU admission did not change significantly (2.4 versus 3.6 %, p = 0.42). Conclusions: HFNP therapy is a safe respiratory support mode to transport infants with mild to moderate work of breathing. The increasing use of HFNP was paralleled by a significant decrease of IV during retrieval. Importantly, we did not observe an increase in delayed intubation in PICU.488 -POSTER SESSIONASSESSMENT BY NURSES AND DOCTORS OF HFOV CHEST WALL MOVEMENT ON A NEONATAL MANNEQUIN A. Shearman 1,2 , T. Drewett 3 , L. Jardine 1,2 , J. Fu 4 Neonatology, Mater Mothers' Hospital, 2 Critical Care of the Newborn Group, Mater Medical Research Institute, 3 Biomedical Electronics, Infrastructure Services, Mater Misericordiae Health Services, 4 Clinical Research Support Centre, Mater Medical Research Institute, South Brisbane, QLD, AustraliaObjectives: Assessment of chest wall movement, or chest wiggle (CW), during HFOV is an essential but subjective clinical skill. Oscillatory pressure amplitude (DP) may be initially set by observing CW and can determine alveolar CO 2 . Alterations in CW can also indicate a change in lung compliance. We aimed to see if there was any difference between experienced clinical nursing and medical staff in their subjective assessment of ''adequate'' (CWa) and ''excessive'' (CWe) CW. Methods: A resuscitation mannequin (SimNewB) on HFOV was observed by clinical staff blinded to the DP. DP was increased by one of the investigators and measurements recorded when participants indicated that CWa and CWe had occurred. Each participant undertook three trials. HFOV frequency and MAP were unchanged during the trials. Results: 13 nurses and 9 doctors were enrolled. Analysis showed that there was no training effect over the 3 trials (p = 0.43). All trials were then pooled for each group. There were no statistically significant differences between nurses and doctors in the median (IQR) DP (cm H 2 O) for CWa (41 (11), 44 (17), p = 0.66) or CWe (64 (13), 62 (11) p = 0.53). Possible confounders such as years of experience and selfrated confidence in the use of HFOV had no effect on the outcomes. Conclusions: In this small sample size investigation, experienced clinical nursing and medical staff make the same visual judgement of two clinically important HFOV assessments, namely, adequate and excessive chest wiggle. A larger sample size is required to confirm these findings.ANALYSIS OF THE PRESSURE WAVEFORM PRODUCED BY TWO COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE BUBBLE CPAP SYSTEMSA. Shearman 1,2 Neonatology, Mater Mothers' Hospital, 2 Critical Care of the Newborn Group, Mater Medical Research Institute, South Brisbane, QLD, Australia Objectives: Bubble CPAP (BCPAP) generates a complex pressure waveform. We aimed to investigate the effects that flow and pressure have on two commercial BCPAP systems. Methods: BABI (Plus) and Fisher & Paykel (BC161-10, BC180) BCPAP systems were connected to a test lung. A flowmeter delivered Pressure was measured within the nasal interface and the test lung. Six 20 s samples were analysed for each combination. Outcomes measured were; average pressure (xPressure), average pressure amplitude (xAmp), maximum power frequency (PowerF) and total power (TPower). Results: Table 1. Analysis (ANOVA) of the effect of flow and pressure on the BCPAP systems outcomes at measurement sites. Table 1 Analysis (ANOVA) of the effect of flow and pressure on the BCPAP systems outcomes at measurement sites Post hoc analysis showed that the BABI Plus BCPAP system had statistically lower xAmp and TPower, and a higher PowerF. Conclusions: The two BCPAP systems produce different pressure waveforms in response to changes in gas flow and pressure settings. These differences may not be clinically important. COMPARISON OF SpO 2 /FiO 2 AND PaO 2 /FIO 2 BASED MARKERS OF RESPIRATORY DYSFUNCTION IN NEONATES WITH NECROTISING ENTEROCOLITIS N.Z. Sim 1,2 , N.J. Hall 1,3 , M.J. Peters 4,5 , A. Pierro 1,3 , S. Eaton 1 Surgery Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health, 2 Neonatal Unit, University College London Hospital, 3 Surgery Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital, 4 Critical Care Group, UCL Institute of Child Health, Intensive Care Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UK Objectives: Severity of illness scores may provide useful prognostic information and are used to guide inclusion into and monitor progress within clinical trials in intensive care. Assessment of respiratory function within such scoring systems frequently requires invasive arterial blood gas (PaO 2 ), a parameter which may not be readily available in neonates. We hypothesized that SpO 2 /FiO 2 ratio can be substituted for PaO 2 /FiO 2 in critically ill neonates with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Methods: Nine-hundred-forty-five paired datapoints (median 26 datapoints per patient [range 1-137]) were prospectively recorded from 26 neonates (median gestational age at birth 27 weeks [range 23-38]) admitted with confirmed NEC (Bell stage II/III). SpO 2 was recorded from a peripherally positioned pulse oximeter. We used quantile logistic regression to examine the relationship between SpO 2 /FiO 2 and PaO 2 /FIO 2 given the conditional nature of SpO 2 /FiO 2 (i.e. a value above 100 %/0.21 [476.2] is not clinically plausible). SpO 2 /FiO 2 threshold values that corresponded with clinically relevant PaO 2 /FiO 2 values were determined. Results: There was a highly significant relationship between SpO 2 / FiO 2 and PaO 2 /FiO 2 (p \\ 0.0001). SpO 2 /FiO 2 values of 165, 270, 377, 439 correspond with PaO 2 /FiO 2 values of 100, 200, 300 and 400, respectively. There was high correlation of respiratory function severity of SpO 2 /FiO 2 category with PaO 2 /FiO 2 using these described values (Kendall's Tau-b correlation coefficient 0.57, p \\ 0.0001).", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF187": {"text": "of paired datapoints within bounded severity categoriesConclusions: These data allow SpO 2 /FiO 2 to be used as a suitable substitute for PaO 2 /FiO 2 in severity of illness scoring systems in this clinical setting.

Hoeve, I.M.J. Mathijssen, M.J. Koudstaal, E.B. Wolvius Dutch Craniofacial Center, Erasmus MC -Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and aims: Robin Sequence (RS) is a congenital disorder found in about 1 in 8,500 to 1 in 20,000 newborns. RS is classically characterized by mandibular hypoplasia, glossoptosis and upper airway obstruction. Management of the airway obstruction is highly controversial. In this study we report the use of respiratory support in children with RS in Rotterdam and consider our approach.

Vlajnic, A. Hansmann, R. Knies, N. Freudenthal, N. M\u00fcller PICU, Zentrum fu\u00a8r Kinderheilkunde/Universita\u00a8tsklinikum Bonn, Bonn, GermanyObjectives: In 2011 we started implementing flexible bronchoscopy in our PICU for management of critically ill patients. It was our goal to implement this technique as a routine diagnostic an interventional tool and to characterize possible benefits. Methods: This is a prospective study including all patients who underwent bronchoscopy in our 10-bed pediatric ICU of a tertiary care children's hospital. All procedures were performed in 2012 by specially trained pediatric intensivists and video documented. Results: 78 patients received bronchoscopy, 117 procedures were performed. Indications were: Treatment of atelectasis and obstruction (68 of 117 procedures), with improvement in ventilation parameters in 51 of 68 procedures (75 %); search for airways anatomic pathologies (51 of 117 procedures), with pathological findings in 28 of 51 procedures (54 %); BAL (37 of 117 procedures), with changed antimicrobial treatment in 15 of 37 cases (41 %). No procedurerelated mortality, serious complications or other problems in patient status occurred. Conclusions: Flexible bronchoscopy is a very safe and useful procedure in critical ill infants and children with a variety of diseases, and significantly contributes to their management. It should be a routine technique in pediatric intensive care units.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF189": {"text": "POSTER SESSION LEAK-COMPENSATION IS INEFFECTIVE IN VENTILATED INFANTS WITH HIGH TUBE LEAKAGE M. Wald, M. Sch\u00f6ber Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, AustriaIntroduction: In neonates endotracheal tubes without cuffs are usually used. A frequent problem of these tubes is tube leakage. New ventilators are able to compensate for leakage. They show an endexpiratory tidal volume also in situations with high leaks. Volume guaranteed ventilation modes need this tidal volume to control the ventilator. The aim of this study was to determine whether ventilators are able to effectively manage leaks higher than 85 % of the per minute ventilation. Method: Three different ventilators for infants with identical ventilation settings (per minute volume of 400 ml/min) were investigated. A port for a leak of 350 ml/min was installed between the flow sensor and the test lung for infants. The end-expiratory tidal volumes and the pressure in the test lung were measured without and with the leaks. Results: The AVEA (CareFusion, USA) shows an expiratory tidal volume of 9.99(\u00b10.1277) ml without, and 2.77(\u00b10.1251) ml with leakage (p \\ 0.001). The Babylog 8000plus (Dr\u00e4ger, Germany) had an expiratory tidal volume of 9.29(\u00b10.0999) ml without and 7.39(\u00b10.0685) ml with leakage (p \\ 0.001). The Fabian (Acutronic, Switzerland) showed an expiratory tidal volume of 10.45(\u00b10.0827) ml without and 7.17(\u00b10.1031) ml with leakage (p \\ 0.001). The measured end inspiratory pressure in the test lung was equal with and without leakage. Conclusion: None of the ventilators was able to show an adequate expiratory tidal volume with high leakage. The volume was much lower than the real tidal volume. In real ventilation with volume guaranteed modes the ventilator is not able to control the maximum pressure during high leak.494 -POSTER SESSIONA MULTI-CENTER PROSPECTIVE STUDY OF MODE OF DELIVERY AND NEONATAL RESPIRATORY OUTCOMES L.

Alonso Quintela 1 , M. Mora Matilla 1 , I. Oulego Erroz 2 , S. Rodr\u00edguez Blanco 3 Pediatrics, 2 Pediatric Intensive Care, 3 Neonatal Intensive Care, Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Leo\u00b4n, Leo\u00b4n, SpainBackground and aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate ultrasound (US) usefulness to verify endotracheal tube position (ETT) and depth of insertion compared to standard capnography and chest x-ray. Methods: We enrolled patients who underwent emergency intubation in neonatal and pediatric intensive care unit. We verified correct ETT position with ultrasound (transversal and longitudinal views) and capnography immediately after every intubation attempt. When intubation was deemed correct by the attending physician, depth of insertion was assessed by ultrasound visualization of ETT tip and bilateral pleural movements (lung sliding sign) to detect ETT malposition. Afterwards x-ray was performed as usual. Time to perform and interpret these techniques was recorded. The attending physician was blinded to ultrasound information. Data are expressed as median (range) or number. Results: 23 intubations and 18 x-ray in 15 patients were analyzed. months-12 years)]. US was comparable to capnography in the number of tracheal/esophageal intubations detected (18/5 vs 19/4, p = 0.685) and also in the estimation of ETT insertion depth (Correct/malposition: 16/2 vs 15/3, p = 0.875). However, important time differences existed [US: 15.5 vs Capnography: 4.5 (3-8) s, p \\ 0.01; and US: 0.28 (0.14-0.42) vs x-ray: 21.5 (16-40) min, p \\ 0.00]. Conclusions: Ultrasound seems an effective but slower method to confirm TI compared to capnography. Ultrasound allows to rapidly discard ETT malposition and may reduce the routine use of x-ray after intubation.Background: The outcome of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in neonates with Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) is so variable that some centres refuse treatment on outcome grounds. We conducted a Retrospective Observational Study of our treatment since the treatment started in 1991 during which time there was one significant change in practice in 2007. Methods: Dataset analysis included Pre ECMO factors (age, birth weight, blood gases, and ventilator settings) and ECMO variables (mode of ECMO, flow at 4 h and 24 h, liquid ventilation, inotropes, timing of repair, and complications on ECMO). Multiple logistic regression was applied to identify. (a) Factors that predict outcome and (b) Relation of complications during ECMO to outcome. (c) Outcome difference in Roller pump and Centrifugal era. Results: 79 neonates were treated during the study period (14 Right side CDHs).The survival to discharge was 62 %. The survival increased in the Centrifugal era (n = 22) compared Roller pump era (n = 57) although not statistically significant (72 vs 58 %, P = 0.22). Multiple logistic regression showed ECMO duration [1 week (63 vs 47 %, P \\ 0.05) and Renal complications (32 vs 12; P \\ 0.05) significantly increased mortality. Mean duration of ECMO (192 \u00b1 198.8 vs 268 \u00b1 172 h, P \\ 0.05 differed between survivors and nonsurvivors. Conclusion: We have high survival rate in our centre for neonates needing ECMO for CDH. We advocate accepting all patients referred for treatment especially in the current Centrifugal era. Prolonged duration of ECMO and renal complications on ECMO were independently associated with mortality. 498 -POSTER SESSION AN AUDIT ON THE TIME CRITICAL TRANSFERS, BY EMBRACE IN THE FIRST 24 MONTHS OF SERVICE N. Athiraman 1 , J. Oldfield 2 Paediatrics, Doncaster Royal Infirmary, Salford Doncaster, Transport Service, Embrace, Barnsley, UKIntroduction: Time critical transfers involve critically ill infants requiring emergency transfer to specialist centres for further care. As delay in transferring these infants has been linked to increased morbidity and mortality, Embrace places an emphasis on immediate activation and mobilisation of the team (which is \\20 min for Embrace and \\60 min nationally), as well as quick and effective stabilisation of the infant before transferring to the specialist centre. Aim: The audit aims to identify the activation, mobilisation and stabilisation times during time critical transfer to assess whether Embrace achieves its locally set target times for infants requiring time critical transfers. Methods: This was a retrospective data collection from the Embrace database. All recorded time critical transfers by Embrace from December 2009 to December 2011 were included in the audit. Results: During the study period, 429 infants were transferred by Embrace by time critical transfers. Embrace complied with their target for activation and mobilisation times in 69.6 % of times and 88.6 % for national target. The median stabilisation time was 115 min. Conclusion: Embrace achieved their target of \\20 min for activation and mobilisation time in two-thirds of transfers and complied with national guidance in 90 % of the times. Hence, shorter activation time of 20 min is achievable when the whole team works towards achieving the target with good organisational and communicational skills. However, it is important to identify the associated outcomes and aim to improve service.499 -POSTER SESSIONA STUDY TO ASSESS THE VALUE OF THORACIC COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY IN PAEDIATRIC TRAUMA PATIENTS M.C. Avanis 1 , Y.-M. Liu 1 , J. Masters 2 , M. Vaidya 1 Paediatric Critical Care, Royal London Hospital, 2 Paediatric Critical Care, Bart's and the London Medical School, London, UK Background and aims: Computed tomography (CT) is becoming increasingly popular as a primary imaging modality in adult trauma patients. This study aims to examine the added value of Thoracic CT (TCT) in the context of paediatric trauma.Methods: Retrospective review of case notes of 46 consecutive paediatric trauma patients aged 16 and younger who received a Chest X-ray (CXR) prior to TCT between July 2011 and April 2012 at a large tertiary paediatric trauma centre in East London. Results: The main mechanisms of injury involved where road traffic accidents (46 %), stab injuries (35 %) and falls (15 %).Twenty-seven patients (59 %) underwent a TCT scan following a normal CXR. Of these, 7 (26 %) patients had new injuries detected. These included lung contusions (n = 6, 86 %) and rib fractures (n = 1, 14 %). Of the 19 (41 %) patients that had a TCT scan following an abnormal CXR, 14 (74 %) had additional injuries detected. These included lung contusions (n = 7, 50 %), fractured ribs (n = 1, 7 %) and a pneumothorax (n = 1, 7 %). The additional information from the TCT did not alter clinical management. Conclusions: This study indicates a need for a comprehensive guideline for imaging in paediatric trauma, where the use of TCT is limited to specific patients, especially in view of the health implications that CT poses and source of financial burden for the NHS.500 -POSTER SESSION BLADDER RUPTURE FOLLOWING UMBILICAL ARTERY CATHETERISATION AND ITS CONSERVATIVE MANAGEMENT.

Aortic lesions occur less frequently. We describe three cases of healthy children involved in road traffic accidents with important abdominal trauma, admitted to our PICU. Case 1: 10-year-old girl, travelling in the back seat with fitted seat belt. Abdominal wall abrasive injuries in seat belt areas were observed, as well as hemoperitoneum, hepatic lacerations, retroperitoneal hematoma in relation to traumatic dissection, partial rupture and thrombosis of the abdominal aorta. A stent was placed by femoral catheterization. On D8 she referred abdominal pain and CT scan revealed intestinal perforation. Outcome was favorable after surgical intervention. Case 2: 8-year-old boy, travelling in the back seat with misplaced belt. He had head trauma and blunt abdominal trauma. Abdominal ultrasound and CT scan showed duodenal hematoma, L2 fracture and post-traumatic pancreatitis, which were medically resolved. Case 3: 4-year-old girl, travelling in the back seat with appropriate restraint system, who suffered left humeral diaphysis fracture, pneumo-peritoneum and pancreatic fracture. Exploratory laparotomy showed gastric perforation and duodenum rupture, as well as pancreatic fracture and complete laceration of the Wirsung, all of which were surgically corrected. All patients fully recovered. High-energy traffic accidents usually cause severe abdominal injuries. External lesions of the thoracoabdominal wall have a positive predictive value of internal injury. CT scan, performed by experienced radiologists to allow for adequate protocol selection, should be the gold-standard for these patients evaluation.504 -POSTER SESSIONCOAGULOPATHY IN PAEDIATRIC TRAUMA PATIENTS: A 4-YEAR REVIEW OF FINDINGS AND OUTCOMES H. Chahal, S. Chandrashekhar, N. Dobby, N. Edmonds Paediatric Critical Care Unit, Royal London Hospital, London, UKBackground: Trauma-induced coagulopathy, independent of fluid resuscitation and transfusion, has been shown to be associated with an increased mortality in adult studies. Evidence-based improvements in transfusion resuscitation in children have lagged behind that of adults. We aim to determine the occurrence of coagulopathy in paediatric trauma patients presenting to a major trauma centre over a 4-year period and the final outcomes. Methods: We reviewed our trauma database for all paediatric patients (0-16 years) from May 2008 to May 2012 presenting as a trauma call. We defined coagulation as being abnormal if the admission blood results revealed an INR C1.3, APTT C33 or PT C13 as per hospital laboratory reference limits. Mortality was recorded at 28-day follow up. Results: 997 paediatric trauma calls were recorded in our database during the 4-year period with coagulation results available in 289. 21 children died, 6 of these had no coagulation profile available.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF192": {"text": "CARDIAC INVOLVEMENT IN HYPOXIC PERINATAL MYOCARDIAL INJURY L. Dimitriu 1 , A.G. Dimitriu 2 Cardiology, Medex Medical Center, 2 Cardiology, UMF 'Gr. T, Popa', Iasi, Romania Purpose: To investigate the clinical aspects and diagnosis of cardiac involvement in perinatal posthypoxic myocardial injury.Methods: Patients 84 newborns (0-14 days), normal birth weight, with perinatal hypoxia receiving resuscitation, without major congenital heart defects. In all cases were performed: clinical exam, ECG, chest X-ray (Rx.CT), Doppler echocardiography. 54 of patients were evaluated clinically and echo after 6 months. Results: The patients had mainly signs of neurological post hypoxic suffering, heart failure (2 cases), a systolic murmur (41 cases) and without others signs of significant cardiac involvement. Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly (37). ECG: severe left ventricle (LV) repolarization disturbances and low voltage of QRS complexes (36), without ischemic changes. Doppler echo performed at 3-7 days of life: * the absence of other severe congenital cardiac anomaly; *permeability of foramen ovalae (100 % cases) to the forced foramen ovalae (gradient LA/RA [ 8 mmHg); *myocardial hypertrophy (45 cases) mainly IVS (29), with mild to severe tricuspid regurgitation and right atrium dilation (28); the systolic function normal (all cases) and severe LV diastolic dysfunction (E/A \\ 1) in 48 cases. All the cases received spironolactone 1-2 mg/kg/day. Reevaluation at 6 months: the reduction of the myocardial hypertrophy, disappearance of the tricuspid regurgitation and normal LV diastolic function. Conclusions: The perinatal hypoxia can induce the apparition of true cardiomyopathy posthipoxic at more than 65 % of patients, the signs of cardiovascular suffering missing often. Echocardiographic exam is the main method for diagnosis and follow up of perinatal hypoxic cardiomyopathy and is necessary from the first week of life.506 -POSTER SESSIONTRANSFUSION REQUIREMENTS IN PAEDIATRIC TRAUMA: A LONDON TRAUMA CENTRE PERSPECTIVE N. Dobby, H. Chahal, M. Vaidya, B. O'Neill, S. Chandrashekhar Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, The Royal London Hospital, London, UKBackground: Our tertiary trauma centre in London receives approximately 250 paediatric trauma calls per annum. We reviewed the transfusion requirements and clinical outcomes for children admitted as trauma emergencies into the Accident and Emergency Department. Methods: Our research group reviewed the notes and computerised records for all paediatric patients (0-16 years) who were admitted as trauma calls between May 2008 and May 2012. The total volume of blood transfused in the first 24 h was our primary end-point. Mortality at 28 days was the secondary end-point. trauma call required blood transfusion. In these 84 children, we noted a mortality of 17 %. The number of children requiring transfusion has halved since 2011. The reduction in the number of children requiring transfusion may be due to a decrease in the incidence and severity of the trauma due to public health measures and education in schools. The implementation of the Paediatric Trauma Haemorrhage Guidelines in 2009 may have influenced the mortality reduction.SURVEY OF NEONATAL CARDIOVERSIONIN NON-CARDIAC CENTRES IN THE UK S. Gaddam Bhoomaiah, R. Wijewardhane, S. Sivakumar City Hospital, Sandwell & West Birmingham NHS Trust, Birmingham, UK Background: DC cardio version is rarely needed in neonates, however, this could be effective and life-saving in certain arrhythmias like atrial flutter. Objectives: Investigate facilities available for neonatal cardio version in non-cardiac units and to explore clinicians' experience and level of confidence in cardio version. Methods: In March 2012, an on-line questionnaire pertaining to current set-up, experience, training and opinion towards cardio version in non-specialist setting, was circulated to all consultants registered with Paediatric Expertise Cardiology Special Interest Group, UK. Results: 27 clinicians responded (5 neonatologists and 22 general paediatricians). Facilities for cardio version are available in 81 % of units. 92 % of responders are aware of location of defibrillator which is hands-free in 59 %. 45 % had some previous experience with cardio version (30 % involved on 1-3 occasions and 15 % on [3 occasions in last 10 years). 92 % received training in cardio version from advanced life support courses, 63 % during specialist registrar training, and 59 % from in-house training. 41 % would transfer to cardiac centre for cardio version, while 55 % would perform in their own ward. Conclusions: It is promising that majority of clinicians are confident in performing this procedure locally with back-up of cardiac centre. To implement this safely and effectively, it is important to devise local pathways and improve training during higher specialist training as well as through mandatory in-house training & advanced life support courses.

There is yet to be widespread adoption of TH in PIC practice. Objective: To identify incidence of TH and assess temperature maintenance during PPCA retrievals by a tertiary paediatric transport service (TPTS). Method: Retrospective cohort study of 50 PPCA transfers (62 patients were referred, 12 died at referral centre) over a 2 year period (December 2010-November 2012). There was no active cooling equipment available to TPTS. Results: All the 50 patients were transferred to a tertiary PICU. TH was specifically advised in 5/50 patients by TPTS at the time of referral. But active cooling (ice packs) was implemented in only 1 patient. Survival to discharge from PICU was 27/62 (44 %).Conclusion: There is low incidence of TH at referral hospitals. Most of the patients were relatively hypothermic (median temperature 34.8\u00b0C) despite no active cooling. There was no significant change in temperature during transfer using passive cooling.

Objective: To identify the survival rate post cardiac arrest and predictive factors for survival. Method: Retrospective cohort study of children referred to a tertiary Paediatric Transport Service during a 2 year period (December 2010-November 2012). All had suffered a cardiac arrest by the time of referral or during stabilisation prior to transfer. Results: 62 children (median age 15.5 months, range 1 day to 15 years) were retrieved. Post resuscitation base excess and especially pH and Lactate are significant indicators of survival. Further prospective studies are needed to delineate and validate these predictive factors.

Programs often consist of didactic courses, water drills and practice of both medical and mechanical emergencies. Simulation based techniques can be used to observe and improve integration of theoretical knowledge, practical and non-technical skills under real time pressure. With the use of our unique custom made simulator we are able to simulate all possible emergencies in relation to ECMO treatment in a standardized and integral way. In these simulation based ECMO emergencies training (ECMOSim) we observed that candidates struggle with the loss of a structured approach due to the fact that there are two patients: the patient manikin and the ECMO machine. Materials and methods: We have developed a structured approach which integrates both ABCD evaluation of the patient and ABC evaluation of the ECMO system in a simple comprehensive way.

Rambaud 1 , A. Chenouard 1 , U. Gouot 2 , P. Hubert 1 , J. Bergounioux 1 Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, 2 Informatics Department, Hospital Necker Enfant Malades, Paris, France Introduction: Phone triage by pediatric intensivists is the main procedure of admission to intensive care department (ICU) with medical and legal issues. To improve and secure this daily activity, we propose to report phone triage in pediatric ICU. Objectives: evaluate and analyze in detail the phone triage activity in a tertiary care center pediatric ICU. Methods: We developed with the Informatics department of our hospital, a program allowing precise recording and classification of the phone triage. This program was developed using freeware (PHP, MySQL, javascript open Flash Chart). All the phone triage calls were systematically recorded on a 5 months period. Results: 342 calls have been recorded on 5 months from March 2012 to September 2012, median was 2 calls per day (0-10). Half of the call came from inside the hospital, 40 % from outside and 10 % were from pediatric retrieval unit. 54 % of the calls resulted in ICU admission. 46 % of the patients were refused ICU admission. The condition of the patient was not considered critical in 32 % of the cases, the unit was declared full in 34 % of the cases and 32 % of the patient were transferred to another intensive care unit or to emergency department. Decision to maintain the patient in the calling clinical department represented only 5 % of the phone triage decisions. Conclusion: Our results shows that PICU phone triage represent a daily clinical activity that need to be precisely evaluated as it provides important information on patients orientation and department activity.Pediatrics Emergency, The Children's Hospital, Lahore, PakistanAims: To determine the response of different anti-convulsants in children presented with seizures in Emergency Department.

The main purposes of the study were to determine incidence of the conditions and to report outcome. Methods: Case records of children admitted to the Pediatric intensive care unit of the National Centre for Maternal and Child Health, Mongolia due to acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome from 2007 to 2012 were reviewed. The following criteria were used to diagnose the cases: acute onset, bilateral infiltrates on chest radiography, arterial oxygen tension/fraction of O 2 in the inspired gases, i.e., PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio \\300 for acute lung injury and less that 200 for acute respiratory distress syndrome, and absence of clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension. Results: A total of 61 children were diagnosed as acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome during study period giving an incidence of 11.5/1,000 admissions. The most (57.4 %) cases were males. Out of the total cases 44.3 % (27 cases) was diagnosed with acute lung injury and 55.7 % (34 cases) was diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Primary lung pathology contributed to a (59.02 %) cases while the rest had nonpulmonary causes. The hospital mortality rate was 60.0 %. Conclusions: The high incidence and mortality of pediatric acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome in Mongolia may necessitate more efforts to improve the accurate diagnosis and treatment system in the country.RESPIRATORY NEONATAL ECMO. EXPERIENCE OFA HIGH VOLUME INSTITUTION S. Speggiorin, S. Robinson, C. Westrope, C. Harvey, G.M. Faulkner, G.J. PeekHeart Link ECMO Unit, Glenfield Hospital, Leicester, UK Background and aims: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a proven therapy for severe neonatal respiratory failure. Our aim is to review the results of respiratory ECMO in babies at a high volume ECMO centre. Methods: Between 2007 and November 2012, all newborn patients with respiratory failure refractory to conventional treatment who required ECMO support have been enrolled in this study. Demographic data, diagnosis, precannulation type of ventilation and blood gas parameters have been described and analysed. Types of cannulation and complications have also been evaluated. Results: In the period observed, 186 patients matched the inclusion criteria. Mean age 3.6 \u00b1 5.09 days. The most common diagnoses were meconium aspiration syndrome in 91 pts (48.9 %), Persistent fetal circulation (PPHN) in 45 (24.2 %), Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) in 22 (11.8) and septicaemia in 15 (8.1). Veno-venous and veno-arterial cannulation were performed in 92 patients each. The mean overall ECMO time was 128 \u00b1 112.6 h. ECMO was successful in 168 pts (90.3 %).Table 1shows univariate analysis for the factors associated to increased hospital mortality.Conclusions: Although this is a very difficult and challenging subgroup of patients, excellent clinical results can be obtained as a result of experience and teamwork.

Betania, Naples, Italy Table 1 Univariate Analysis Conditions associated with higher mortality Significance (p value)Background and aims: Interventions performed in the first minutes of life of very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates may have a direct influence on immediate survival and morbidity. The use of all technologies of a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) directly in a delivery room (DR) has been suggested, but data on the efficacy of this approach are still lacking. We aimed to investigate the advantage of resuscitation of preterm neonates at birth directly in the NICU. Methods: We designed a prospective study on VLBW neonates born from January 2008 to April 2009. In the first 8 month of the study neonates were initially assisted in DR and then transferred in NICU (non-DR-NICU approach), in the subsequent period the neonates were assisted directly in the NICU at birth (DR-NICU approach). Main outcome of the study was neonatal morbidity during hospitalization. Results: We observed 106 VLBW neonates (body weight 1,085 \u00b1 297 g, gestational age 28.6 \u00b1 3.4 weeks, male 48.1 %). Fifty were assisted according to DR-NICU approach. Main clinical and demographic characteristics of the 2 cohort were similar. Early use of non invasive ventilation was higher when DR-NICU approach was used (0 vs. 18 %, p \\ 0.05). Occurrence of intraventricular hemorrhage (34 vs. 12 %, p = 0.008) and late-onset sepsis (12 vs. 2 %, p = 0.036) were increased during non-DR-NICU compared to DR-NICU period. Conclusions: DR-NICU approach favored the early use of noninvasive ventilation and reduce neonatal morbidity.530 -POSTER SESSIONDOES BLOODY ASPIRATE REFLECT THE STATE OF UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL MUCOSA IN A CRITICALLY ILL NEWBORN? R. Tomerak 1 , A. El Badawy 1 , A. Eskandar 2 , A. Mahmoud 1Pediatrics, 2 Cairo University, Cairo, EgyptCritically ill newborns have many risk factors to develop stress related mucosal lesions (SRML). We used upper endoscopy to evaluate the presence of SRML in these neonates, to know the specificity and sensitivity of the bloody gastric aspirate to detect SRML and to identify the risk factors associated with the presence of SRML and bloody gastric aspirate. Patients and methods: This is a cross-sectional study done on 100 critically ill newborn after becoming clinically stable. SRML were diagnosed if there is hyperemia, erosions or ulcers in the esophagus, stomach, and/or the duodenum. Results: SRML were found in 77 % of neonates in the neonatal intensive care units (NICU) though frank bloody aspirate was detected in only 22 % of neonates. The presence of bloody aspirate showed low sensitivity (24.68 %) for the presence of SRML and high specificity (86.96 %). The presence of bloody gastric aspirate showed a double fold risk for the presence SRML (OR = 2.184, CI = 0.584-8.171). Factors associated with SRML included respiratory distress (p = 0.000, risk = 4.006), the use of nasogastric tube (p = 0.017, OR = 3.281) and the use of triple antibiotics (p = 0.001, risk = 1.432). Factors associated with the presence of bloody gastric aspirate included the use of nasogastric tube (OR = 1.629, p = 0.000) and the presence of haemostatic disorders (OR = 3.143, p = 0.039). It was also associated with lower hemoglobin levels (p = 0.000).Conclusion: SRML represents an under-diagnosed problem in NICUs. Absence of bloody gastric aspirate does not exclude the presence of SRML. Arab J Gastroenterol. Published by Elsevier B.V. 531 -POSTER SESSION EFFECTS OF SUSTAINED ABDOMINAL AORTA COMPRESSION ON CORONARY PERFUSION PRESSURES AND RESTORATION OF SPONTANEOUS CIRCULATION DURING CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION IN SWINE M. Zhou Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College, Zunyi, ChinaObjectives: The present study was undertaken to explore whether sustained abdominal aorta compression-cardiopulmonary resuscitation (SAAC-CPR), as a means, can raise coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) as well as restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) during CPR. In the present study, we hypothesised that SAAC-CPR elevates CPP during CPR and improves ROSC, without causing liver laceration. Methods: Animals were randomised into one of two groups (Standard CPR and SAAC-CPR). Ten domestic swine (22-25 kg) were anaesthetised, intubated and mechanically ventilated. Ventricular fibrillation was induced, and after 3 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation, the animals were treated with standard CPR (with simplex chest compression (SCC) and epinephrine) or SAAC-CPR (SCC with sustained abdominal aorta compression, without epinephrine). CPP and ROSC were compared. Results: SCC with sustained abdominal aorta compression (SCC + SAAC) significantly increased CPP in comparison with SCC during CPR (p \\ 0.05). The increase in CPP with SCC + SAAC is equivalent to that achieved with epinephrine (p [ 0.05). All animals in the standard CPR and SAAC-CPR groups restored spontaneous circulation. No liver damage was found in post-mortem examinations of the swine subjects. Conclusions: During CPR, non-invasive SAAC can rapidly and reversibly raise the CPP as much as can epinephrine and is especially suitable for out-of-hospital CPR.532 -POSTER SESSIONASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN ACE GENE POLYMORPHISM AND THE COURSE OF ASPHYXIA IN NEWBORNS T.K.

Methods: Eight 127 day gestation lambs were studied. Prior to delivery, lambs were intubated and electrical impedance tomography (EIT) electrodes applied. EIT was used to real-time monitor global, dorsal and ventral hemithorax lung volume. At birth a SI of 40 cm H 2 O was applied until the global EIT volume signal was stable for 10-s. Single-phase and slow and fast-phase exponential models were applied post hoc in attempt to model the volumetric behaviour of the lung during the SI. Results: The time required to achieve stable volume was variable; median (IQR) 82.6 (58.8, 89.9) s. The ventral (non-gravity dependent) hemithorax accounted for 68.5 (60.0, 69.1) % of all recruited lung volume during the SI. A single-phase exponential model could describe volume change in all lung regions; median (Range) R 2 0.934 (0.832, 0.978). Using this model the dorsal hemithorax stablised a median (IQR) 4.0 (2.5, 6.9) s before the ventral (p = 0.031; Wilcoxon matched-pairs tests). A simulation program has been developed that automates the SI delivery based on clinical volumetric response using EIT. Conclusions: In this preterm model, time to stabilise volume during a SI exhibited considerable variability between subjects and, to a lesser extent, within the lung. Fixed (or prescribed) time/pressure SI algorithms may not account for this. Direct measures of volume may aid in directing an individuals response to a SI at birth and warrant further investigation.BRAIN DEATH AND ORGAN DONATION DUE TO CHILD ABUSEC.

There is paucity of data on emergency intubation of critically ill infants. Aims: To Highlight:Background: Elective caesarean section before 39 weeks has been associated with a higher incidence of iatrogenic respiratory distress and pneumothorax in term newborn babies, probably because of a higher respiratory morbidity and the need of resuscitation. These factors have not been systematically evaluated in our patients. Objective: To know whether the gestational age, type of delivery, and intensity of resuscitation, are associated with an increment in the incidence of pneumothorax in term neonates. Patients and methods: Full term neonates born in our maternity from January 2006 to December 2010 were studied, together with the type of delivery (Vaginal, Forceps or Caesarean Section). Advanced CPR was defined as the need of bag and mask intermittent ventilation, intubation, chest compression and/or administration of medication. The diagnosis of pneumothorax was clinical and radiological in all cases. Results: 32,238 full term new-borns were included. Type of delivery: Vaginal 76.1 %, C-Section 12.4 %, and Forceps 11.5 %. The incidence of pneumothorax was 0.316 %. It was significantly higher in C-Section (0.85 %), than Forceps (0.59 %) or non-instrumental Vaginal deliveries (0.19 %) (p = 0.000); in infants C40 weeks GA (0.37 %) than B39 weeks GA (0.24 %) (p = 0.033); and in advanced CPR (4.29 %) compared to basic CPR (0.18 %) (p = 0.000). Conclusions: A GA C40 weeks, C-Section or Forceps delivery, and advanced CPR were significantly associated with a higher incidence of pneumothorax in full term newborn babies. We did not observe any increase of pneumothorax among neonates born through elective C-Section before 39 weeks of gestation. Background: Heat loss after delivery could interfere with adaptation due to metabolic and hemodynamic derangements. Associated perinatal factors and its relation with morbidity and mortality during the neonatal period have not been systematically studied in our unit. Objectives: To know the temperature of VLBW infants on admission to our NICU, and to determine the associated perinatal variables, and the association of temperature with morbidity and mortality. Patients and methods: Infants born in our maternity from January 2006 to November 2012, birth weights 401-1,499 g and/or \\30 weeks GA, were included. Bivariate associations between antepartum/birth variables and admission temperature, and between this and selected morbidities and mortality were examined, followed by multivariable linear or logistic regressions to detect independent associations. Results: 635 infants were included. Mean (\u00b1SD) BW and GA were 1,137.6 \u00b1 257.6 g, and 29.48 \u00b1 2.82 weeks, respectively.

We aimed to describe the pattern of uNGAL levels in this population in a pilot study. Method: We evaluated daily uNGAL levels up to 14 days in 10 kidney (KT) and 12 liver transplant recipients (LT) receiving tacrolimus. uNGAL cut-offs of 2.2 and 135 ng/ml were used, as previously found in healthy children (\\2.2 ng/ml) and children at risk for AKI ([135 ng/ml) .Results: In KT recipients, the median uNGAL level was 14.9 (IQR: 29.6) ng/ml. Sixty-two of the uGNAL measurements (92.5 %) were above 2.2 ng/ml and three (4.5 %) in two patients were above 135 ng/ ml. All KT patients had an uNGAL [2.2 ng/ml at least once during the first 14 days after transplantation. In LT recipients, the median uNGAL level was 13.6 (IQR: 21.9) ng/ml. 90 % of all uNGAL measurements were above 2.2 ng/ml. Seven uNGAL measurements (7 %) in two LT patients were higher than 135 ng/ml. No relation was found between high uNGAL levels and AKI. Conclusion: This is the first study in pediatric transplant recipients reporting uNGAL levels up to 14 days post-transplantation. Although, most uNGAL levels were not suggestive for AKI, they were higher than reported in healthy children, suggestive of subclinical renal function. We suggest uNGAL to be investigated as an early biomarker for subtle renal function loss. Objectives: In the PICU, midazolam is regularly administered orally in the absence of IV access. The lack of information on maturation of intestinal CYP3A, the drug metabolizing enzyme which is involved in oral absorption of midazolam, hampers adequate dosing of oral midazolam in children. The aim of this study was to investigate CYP3A mediated oral bioavailability (F) and clearance (CL) of oral midazolam across the pediatric age range. Methods: Pharmacokinetic (PK) data were obtained from a combined dataset of 7 previously reported studies in 52 preterm infants (26-37 weeks, PNA 2-13 days), 305 children (3 month-18 years) and 20 adults, who received IV and/or PO midazolam. Population PK modeling was performed using NONMEM v6.2, and the influence of PNA, bodyweight (BW), and study population was investigated. Results: Midazolam F was negatively influenced by BW in an allometric function and decreased from 67 % (29-100 %) in a preterm neonate (0.77) kg to 17 % (7-27 %) in an adult (70 kg). BW influenced midazolam CL in a previously introduced allometric function with a BW dependent exponent (BDE), gradually changing from 0.82 in a preterm neonate (0.77 kg) to 0.28 in an adult (70 kg). Conclusions: Midazolam F decreases from preterm neonates to adults, leading to higher systemic availability of midazolam concentrations in preterm neonates (67 %) compared to older children or adults (17 %). This information may aid to design dosing guidelines for oral CYP3A substrates in children, which take into account maturation in CYP3A mediated drug metabolism.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 602, "end": 614, "text": "([135 ng/ml)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 770, "end": 777, "text": "(4.5 %)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2159, "end": 2177, "text": "(3 month-18 years)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "annex"}, {"text": "Objective: To compare neonatal respiratory outcomes by method of delivery in a large diverse cohort in China. Methods: 52 hospitals from 23 provinces of China were enrolled in this prospective study from May 1st 2010 to December 31st 2011. A standardized database was established in each hospital and all the data were transferred to Children's Hospital of Fudan University simultaneously. Birth complicated by known congenital anomalies was excluded. Associations between method of delivery and neonatal respiratory morbidities were estimated using logistic regression. Results: Total 100,308 neonates were identified. The overall cesarean delivery rate was 46.68 % (range between 11.49 and 73.79 %). The proportion of elective cesarean delivery among all cesarean delivery was 84.41 %. Comparing to vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery was associated with increased morbidities of RDS (1.19 vs. 0.72 %, p \\ 0.0001, , TTN (1.11 vs. 0.29 %, p \\ 0.0001, ) and respiratory failure (0.28 vs. 0.13 %, p \\ 0.0001, 95 %CI 1.576-2.835).

Objectives: Main goal of our study was to assess importance of prone position and ventilation mode (conventional and HFOV) application sequence on the histopathological image of lung tissue damage in experimental model of ARDS. Methods: We enrolled total of 34 experimental models (piglets). Group 1 (control group) had conventional ventilation mode in supine position; group 2 (PP) had conventional ventilation mode with the circulation of prone position (6 h) and supine position (6 h); group 3 (HFOV) had HFOV ventilation mode in supine position during the whole experiment; group 4 (HFOV + PP) had HFOV ventilation mode in supine position for initial 6 h, afterwards the circulation of prone position and supine position was established; group 5 (PP + HFOV) had conventional ventilation mode with the circulation of prone and supine position and after 6 h model was switched to HFOV ventilation. We collected four lung tissue samples from each piglet-bilaterally from dorsocaudal (dependent, D) lung segments and bilaterally from ventrorostral (non-dependent, ND) lung segments. Detected changes in lung tissue were scored in extensity (e, 0-3) and intensity (i, 0-4). Results: We found no significant differences in all studied parameters between all groups. Moreover, there was also no difference in intensity and extensity of changes in dependent and non-dependent lung segments. Introduction: The kidney is the most damaged organ in asphyxiated infants. Renal vasoconstriction due to adenosine metabolite may lead to a fall in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This study was designed to determine whether aminophylline an adenosine receptor antagonist, could prevent or ameliorate kidney dysfunction in neonates with perinatal asphyxia. Materials and methods: Forty term neonates with perinatal asphyxia were randomized to study (n = 19) and control group (n = 21) who received a intravenously a single dose of aminophylline (5 mg/kg) or an equal volume of placebo (5 % dextrose in water) during the first 3 h of life, respectively.

More than a half of the study lot showed sodium and chloride ion imbalances, resulting in 22 cases of induced acidosis (16/VPA, 6/CBZ). BUN/creatinine ratios were also high for many of the children: 23/VPA, 4/CBZ, as were liver enzyme levels, for 8 children. In seven of the investigated subjects (5/VPA, 2/CBZ), ammonium ions were present in excess, suggesting an increased NH 4 + production to compensate for metabolic acidosis-a theory upheld by statistical correlation (p = 0.022). It can be assumed that an increase in ammonium ion concentration could be considered a warning signal for severe upcoming impairment of renal and hepatic functions. Conclusions: Anticonvulsant therapy needs to be carefully monitored, especially in children, who are more susceptible to homeostasis changes associated with anaemia, clotting disorders and impaired hydro electrolyte and hepatic balances.Respiratory Failure (585-588)", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods:"}, {"text": "Objectives: The Victorian Paediatric Emergency Transport Service (PETS) provides advice on management and performs retrieval of critically ill children throughout Victoria, Tasmania and Southern New South Wales.
