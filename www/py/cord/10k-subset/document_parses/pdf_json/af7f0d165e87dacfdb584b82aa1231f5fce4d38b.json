It is highly expressed in juvenile brains, but its postnatal function has not been determined due to mortality in KIF2A-deficient mice. In addition, KIF2A is a causal gene in human Malformation of Cortical Development (MCD) with epilepsy, but the contribution of KIF2A to its pathogenesis is not yet understood due to the small number of human patients. In this study, we first analyzed the prenatal function of KIF2A using kif2a-KO mice. These mice were pale, breathed irregularly, and exhibited frequent twitching in addition to malformations resembling those in kif2a-mutated human patients. To determine the post-migration function of KIF2A, we generated newly tamoxifen-inducible conditional knockout mice. Despite successful neuronal migration, all offspring displayed hyper-activity, weight loss, severe cortical/hippocampal-focus epilepsy, and died. Interestingly, KIF2A was highly expressed in excitatory axons, in cortical neurites in layers II/III/V and in dentate mossy fibers (MF). In the cortex, the loss of KIF2A generated aberrant axon sprouting in those layers. In the hippocampus, the loss of KIF2A resulted in the development of hippocampal sclerosis, MF sprouting, and recurrent excitatory circuits resembling but different from TLE. These phenotypes developed without excitation. cKO granule cells exhibited failed axon/dendrite determination, and developed multiple short axons throughout the entire molecular layer. These results suggest that KIF2A is crucial postnatally for establishing accurate neuronal circuits, in addition to its role in prenatal cell survival, migration, and axon elongation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Integration of metagenomics and metabolomics in gut microbiome research Maryam Goudarzi 1 and Albert J. Fornace Jr. 1, 2, 3, 4 The gut is the largest reservoir of microbes in the body, harboring more than 100 trillion microorganisms in a well-balanced communication with the host factors. The gut microbiota plays an essential role in a wide range of biological functions such as digestion and the development of immunological responses. The microbial community composition and diversity is important in maintaining the homeostatis in the host. Factors, which may influence the gut microbial composition include diet, environmental exposures, age, genetics, and many more. Recent advances in technology, particularly 16S rRNA sequencing and mass spectrometry have enabled us to survey these microbial communities at the phylogenetic level and assess the host/microbes cometabolism. The metagenomic studies have shed light on the functional composition of the gut microbiota and have determined that in diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) there is an increase in functions of the auxotrophic and pathobiont bacteria. A number of studies have also pointed to an increase in the sulfate-reducing bacteria, such as Desulfovibrio, in IBD. On the other hand, metabolomics studies have revealed that taurine-conjugated bile acids increase the availability of free sulfur causing an expansion of the sulfate-reducing pathobiont Bilophila wadsworthia, which drive colitis in genetically susceptible IL10 \u2212/\u2212 but not wild-type mice. Furthermore, an increased in glutathione transport and riboflavin metabolism and a decrease in biosynthesis of amino acids have been reported in ulcerative colitis patients, which is indicative of increased predisposition for managing oxidative stress, a hallmark of an inflammatory environment. Our current studies have explored the correlative nature of the microbe/ host co-metabolism to characterize the regulatory role of microbiota in maintaining host health. These correlative host/microbial studies have the potential to determine causality, response to treatment, risk prediction, and keystone species for use as probiotics in diseases such as IBD or colitis induced by immuno-radiotherapy. Central Nervous System Tumors (CNST) are a collection of neoplasms that grow in the brain and the spinal cord. Long term survival for patients carrying these tumors can reach at best 14 % in countries that provide optimal health operating systems. Despite advancement in cancer targeted therapy, surgery and radiation remain typically the main methods of treatment, even though both are challenging and may affect the quality of life of survivors adversely. Inventive approaches and deeper comprehensions of tumor characteristics are needed to transform treatment options for CNST patients. We established a unique integrated system to enable analysis of multiple bio-parameters of individual CNST. Each sample recovered was prepared to preserve tissue and generate a corresponding cell line with a purpose to process for genetic, biochemical, cytological and pharmacological analysis. A collection of 84 tumors were recovered, with a wide range of tumor types including Meningiomas, Astrocytomas, Oligodendrogliomas, Medulloblastomas and Glioblastomas. Generating a tumor type combined outlook facilitated access to vital information, as exemplified by the analysis of sixteen primary Meningiomas. Investigating the gene expression profile of uncultured tumors samples while considering the live cell behavior in relation to morphology, growth, stemness and sensitivity to chemotherapy, enabled the identification of possible novel prognostic markers for Meningiomas, including the recently associated cancer stem cell marker Anterior Gradient 2 Homolog (AGR2).

The exact pathogenesis of these disorders remains elusive. We investigated functional consequences of deletion of microRNAs (miRNAs) residing on chromosome 7q, focusing on miR-595. Using a novel assay, several targets for miR-595 were identified, including a large ribosomal subunit RPL27A. RPL27A downregulation induced p53 activation, apoptosis and inhibited proliferation. Importantly, p53-independent effects were identified secondary to a reduction in the ribosome subunit 60s with associated ribosome dysgenesis. Of note, RPL27A overexpression showed no significant effects on p53 mRNA levels but did enhance proliferation. In normal CD34+ cells, RPL27A knockdown preferentially blocked erythroid proliferation and differentiation. Lastly, miR-595 appears significantly downregulated in MDS patient samples possessing -7/-7q anomalies compared to those with normal karyotype. We postulate that haploinsufficency of miR-595 in patients with -7/del 7q may contribute to disease pathogenesis via RPL27A modulation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "O5"}, {"text": "Next generation DNA sequencing panels for haemostatic and platelet disorders and for Fanconi anaemia in routine diagnostic service Anne Goodeve, Laura Crookes, Nikolas Niksic, Nicholas Beauchamp Sheffield Diagnostic Genetic Service, Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust, Western Bank, Sheffield, UK Correspondence: Anne Goodeve (a.goodeve@sheffield.ac.uk) -Sheffield Diagnostic Genetic Service, Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust, Western Bank, Sheffield, UK BMC Genomics 2016, 17(Suppl 6):O6", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "O6"}, {"text": "Next Generation sequencing (NGS) is transforming delivery of diagnostic molecular genetics. Gene panels are being utilised to analyse groups of related disorders and to extend diagnostic capability in comparison with previous Sanger sequencing. The aim of this study is to examine the utility of gene panels for diagnostic/research NGS analysis of haemostatic and platelet disorders and for Fanconi anaemia. Requests were received for all but one (F5) genes on the haemostasis/platelet panel. Candidate pathogenic mutations were identified in 24 of 39 patients (62 %), including 15/16 males diagnosed with haemophilia A and 3/7 individuals with possible von Willebrand disease. Some analyses (e.g. ADAMTS13, MYH9, VWF) were requested to help exclude specific diagnoses. In addition to analysis of single genes, combinations were analysed simultaneously, e.g. F8 & F9 (possible carrier relative of deceased haemophilia patient; unknown type); F8, F9, F13A1, F13B and VWF (baby died of bleeding shortly after birth), F8 & VWF (low FVIII:C). In contrast, nearly all patients referred for FA analysis were seeking a diagnosis of the disorder and all 16 genes were analysed in most individuals investigated (15/19). Biallelic mutations were identified in 7 cases (33 %) in BRCA2, FANCA, FANCC, FANCD2 and FANCG. A single heterozygous mutation was identified in 2 patients (13 %), 2 heterozygous mutations in different genes in 1 case (7 %), homozygous mutations in 2 (13 %) and no mutation in 5 (33 %). We can conclude that NGS provides a single laboratory workflow for analysis of gene panels for related disorders as well as for whole genomes/exomes. Data analysis can include a single gene, such as ADAMTS13, or \u2265 1 gene for disorders such as those affecting fibrinogen. For disorders potentially caused by one of the several genes in a pathway such as FA, all can be analysed simultaneously. Use of NGS provides a single laboratory workflow for analysis of gene panels for many different disorders and can dramatically reduce time to achieve a definitive diagnosis. Several milestones have to be achieved in order to introduce the concept of personalized medicine to the healthcare system in Saudi Arabia. There is a notable lack of publicly available information about the \"normal\" genetic makeup of this population which is hindering the complete elucidation of \"disease\" genomes. Therefore, it is important that considerable effort should be spent on the identification of the genetic and epigenetic risk factors that predispose to the common diseases in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Knowledge gained will help in the elucidation of disease biomarkers and drug response modifiers. Furthermore, providers of personalized medicine should validate internationally-approved biomarkers and risk factor indicators for use in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Most importantly, genetic tests offered to the public should be designed to be cost-effective without compromising sensitivity or specificity and with fast turnaround amenable to use in the clinic. Towards this end, we at the Center of Innovations in Personalized Medicine (CIPM) at King Abdulaziz University are utilizing the robustness of the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine to design genetic tests for afflictions common to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We have designed and tested custom Ampliseq panels as well as used panels from the Life Technologies catalog. Our array of targeted sequencing panel now covers conditions such as deafness, betathalassemia, thrombophilia, inborn errors of metabolism, and cancer susceptibility. We will report on the progress achieved so far and discuss the future of such platform in the delivery of individualized diagnostics. Biospecimens are collected from patients and other donors in a variety of ways for basic, clinical and epidemiologic research studies. Methods for collecting, processing, storing and analyzing biospecimens have usually been developed locally for diagnostic and research purposes, with little consideration for standardization or long-term quality management. Biospecimen management has developed into a more scientifically-based endeavor, as researchers have realized that biospecimens and data of consistent quality are required as we enter the era of precision medicine. Best practices have been developed by organizations such as the International Society for Biological and Environmental and Repositories (ISBER), the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI), the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the European Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Biospecimen research programs have been developed to establish evidence-based standard procedures to control the collection and processing of biospecimens. Molecular data from the analysis of biospecimens contribute directly to the diagnosis of disease and treatment of patients. Various \"pre-analytical\" variables can affect the quality of biospecimens. Among these variables are: the amount of time that it takes for surgical removal of the biospecimen; the time the specimen spends at room temperature before it is frozen or fixed with formalin; and many other variables that can affect biospecimen quality. There is the potential for: incorrect diagnoses; incorrect treatment; irreproducible results; and overall the potential for misinterpretation of artifacts as new biomarkers. The adoption of best practices for biospecimen collection and processing is an important part of the strategy to advance translational research and precision medicine.

However, forensic science (for 30 years) embraced the field of genetics and built an entire infrastructure relying on DNA typing from biospecimen collection to final results integrated under strict and formal quality assurance guidelines. Both the medical and forensic disciplines rely on the accumulation of big data to perform precision, or personalized, analyses. These two disciplines have built biobanks and/or databanks with different rationales, designs and governance. Databanks and databases can be exploited to harness the power of emerging technologies and either enable detection of putative genes or potential suspects, and promote development of innovative biomarkers and treatments. Both resources must provide value, have proper ethical/conduct governance, develop capabilities to store and retrieve samples and annotated data, and be managed and maintained. Medical databases typically are governed by institutions (often not government agencies, although constrained by laws) and can be either free to those who donate samples or consumers pay for tests. Samples and metadata are provided on a voluntary consent basis, and the resource may be available to many interested parties. Forensic databases are controlled by the government, access is limited to law enforcement, and sample donation often is mandatory. Medical and forensic big data resources, views of data sharing, experiences of both systems users are discussed. Another resource, the human microbiome, should be considered. The composition of the microbiome can affect health and well-being. Indeed, the microbiome may end up being a more flexible and dynamic manner to address aspects of personalized medicine. Forensic genetics also may benefit as the microbes may serve as genetic signatures that could individualize humans and serve as another powerful identification tool. Forensic and medical biobanks should begin considering on how to sample, collect and store such samples in suitable core facilities, the microbiome banks. Such integration of the microbiome to either forensic and/or medical biobanks will revolutionize current approaches towards individualized medicine and precision forensics.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "O6"}, {"text": "Since the achievement of the Human Genome Project in 2003, a significant increase in biobanks in terms of number, design, scale and governance has been noticed worldwide in order to support effective genomic research. Biobanks/Biorepositories are the main core around which OMICs scale research and advanced clinical applications have been performed to drive the Precision Medicine wave toward shaping the future of human welfare. Consequently, a biobanking unit has been developed at the Center of Excellence in Genomic Medicine (CEGMR) in 2008 to collect, store and release high quality biospecimens with fully annotated clinico-pathological data according to best practices established worldwide in order to deliver personalized diagnostics and tailor individualized therapeutics for the Saudi population. Despite promising milestones and over 150 publications in ISI journals using CEGMR Biobank Unit (CBU) biospecimens, the awareness about biobanking and biospecimen donation remains the foremost challenge. Reaching the benefits of biobanks rely on an educated public and well trained healthcare providers that will enable the establishment of perpetual and comprehensive partnerships between several stakeholders involved in healthcare service. A survey conducted by our CBU team targeted healthcare students at King Abdulaziz University and showed that only 46 % of them have heard about the \"Human Genome Project\". Surprisingly, 72 % of these future healthcare providers have never heard of the term \"biobank\" which was significantly correlated with lower willingness to donate biospecimens. Interestingly, around 50 % of healthcare students were willing to donate biospecimens and believed that it will advance medical research and benefit the whole society. Better general health status, previous blood donation and higher scores of biobanking knowledge were significantly associated with the willingness to donate (p-value = 0.048, p-value = 0.043 and p-value < 0.001, respectively). These findings highlight the urgency of developing a multidisciplinary awareness strategy to integrate biobanking and OMICs scale approaches in the healthcare students' curricula, building up therefore well qualified healthcare providers' competencies. Simultaneously, a suitable and lifelong public outreach program about biobanking tailored to the diverse communities in Saudi Arabia must be launched to ensure their effective involvement in the biobanking and precision medicine trend with adequate awareness about benefits and risks.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "O6"}, {"text": "with standard fluoropyrimidines-based chemotherapeutic regimens, still adverse effects and development of chemoresistance are important limitations to pharmacological therapy. Some biomarkers to guide CRC treatment have been developed and some of them are considered valid by the regulatory agencies and included in the technical sheet of the drugs but many others are still \"probable valid\" needed of additional validation and cost-efficiency studies. Some of the most promising biomarkers are still not translated to clinical practice nor approved by the agencies. In addition, there is a lack of integration in a common framework of biomarkers at different levels (germline, somatic, epigenetic) limiting translation and cost-efficiency analysis. Here we present a strategy for the translation to clinical practice of pharmacogenomic biomarkers to predict response (both efficacy and ADRs) and to guide treatment in colorectal cancer including previous valid biomarkers approved by EMA, probable biomarkers at germline and somatic level. The selected markers include variants at DNA level (sequence level and methylation markers) and RNA level (including miRNA). The use of specific CTC genomic alterations associated with treatment resistance and recurrence to guide the selection of target therapies in mCRC patients will be also discussed. The final goal is an integrative approach for a practical translation to clinical practice of CRC pharmacogenomics. To achieve this goal cost efficiency studies will be performed and a pilot project has been to organize workflow and optimize decision-making processes. With the decrease of the cost of high throughput genotyping and sequencing, Genome wide Association Studies (GWAS) have become a good approach to identify sequence variations and mainly Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) that are related to complex and common diseases. However, GWAS data allow only associational inference and is only able to identify sequence variants that are statistically associated with the disease status. The last seven years have seen an exponential growth in the number of GWAS which resulted in over 15 thousand associated Single Nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in more than 2100 published studies. Although many statistical methods and algorithms have been developed to increase the power to detect association, testing causal relationship between the associated SNPs and the disease risk was not given much attention. A causal variant is a 'mutation' that contributes to an increase in risk to disease. Establishing causality from association is thus a challenging task, hindered by many complicating factors and remains a major concern in identifying genetic causes of common diseases, particularly for clinical translation of GWAS findings. In order to establish causality, we generally need intervention, which means not only observing the genotypes of some individuals but taking actions that can manipulate these genotypes, which can only be done in animal models. However, recent studies showed that, although we cannot estimate causal effects using observations alone, it is possible to use the classical framework of causality inference to get estimate of lower bounds for these effects. Here I build on recent works within the Bayesian networks modeling framework, to present an original approach to test causality based on observation data only. Based on standard GWAS data alone, this approach provides a measure for ranking causal effects of associated variants. The accuracy and stability of this measure is assessed and compared to other approaches. Selecting the most likely causal variants from GWAS results will allow the prioritization and designs of targeted experiments to unravel causal mechanisms underlying association and effective clinical translation of GWAS findings for genomic medicine, including individual risk prediction, advanced clinical strategies and personalized treatments.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "O6"}, {"text": "O15 E-GRASP: an interactive database and web application for efficient analysis of disease-associated genetic information Sajjad Karim 1 , Hend F Nour Eldin 1 , Heba Abusamra 1 , Elham M Alhathli 1 , Nada Salem 1 , Mohammed H Al-Qahtani 1 , and Sudhir Kumar 1, 2 Genome-wide association study data is used widely to identify the genetic variants associated with complex traits or common disease.

GRASP v2.0 users face difficulties in access and correlation of SNPs with traits. Thus we aimed to design an interactive database providing detailed information of SNPs required for better data interpretation, communication between possible collaborators and new hypotheses to be generated. To develop a web application, we used ASP.net as front-end tool; SQL server, MatLab, D3.js, D3Plus.js and jQuery data table as back-end tools; JavaScript and Ajax for client-side purpose. MATLAB was used to analyse the statistical replication and evolutionary information of each SNPs and all SNPs were mapped to genome position of human genome build 38 (hg38) using LiftOver. We developed a new web application called E-GRASP using an advance tool and different filter code to retrieve and represent data in better way leading to fast and easy data analysis. We retrieved and retained all information of GRASP in E-GRASP and added new information including statistical replication and evolutionary information of each SNPs. E-GRASP provides information under following categories: (i) SNPs view-provides information about SNPid, PMID, P-value, chromosome, position, number of studies and phenotypes for each SNPs; (ii) Study view-explains about unique SNPs replication in each studies and phenotypes, and (iii) Evolutionary view-describes evolutionary information including E-value for SNP phenotype association, E-rank of the evolutionary rate and time span of the position retrieved from the \"E-rank Web Server\" for each SNP.

Fertility Until recently KS men were considered infertile as about 90 % of KS men are azoospermic. Recently, sperm were obtained by testicular sperm extraction for intracytoplasmic sperm injection into oocytes, resulting in live-born children. Most of these children have a euploid karyotype as these sperm derive from tubuli with euploid spermatogonial foci. As shown in a KS mouse model these spermatogonia get lost during early development so that cryopreservation of testicular biopsies from prepubertal boys for later gamete maturation in vitro is discussed.

Conclusions Almost 40 % of human genes do not have a PfamA or GO annotation, no current studies provide a list of potential functions [3, 4] . We found that only two proteins, superoxide dismutase 1 and 2 (SOD1 and SOD2) had genetic interactions, while SOD3 had only one physical interaction which was inferred from mouse, also nitric oxidase 4 (NOX4) and glutathione peroxidase 5 (GPX5) didn't show any interactions Other proteins showed physical interactions and more than 90 % those proteins had minimum 4 unique interactors. Oxidative stress response proteins with high number of interactions are involved in biological processes in sperm, and by manipulating this PPI network we simulated sperm specific conditions. Catalase (CAT) is not present in mature sperm, in the absence of CAT, the interactome would shift to new PPIs involving other antioxidants or alternative pathways. Combining computational and experimental tools for identifying PPIs will enrich the maps of PPIs in germ cells, and help understanding molecular basis of the increase in infertile population.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 66, "end": 69, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 70, "end": 72, "text": "3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 334, "end": 337, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 604, "end": 607, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 608, "end": 610, "text": "4]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is an important regulator of innate and acquired immune responses with a proposed role in a variety of early inflammatory responses [1] .

The identification of charge clusters (runs of charged residues) in proteins and their mapping within the sequence is an important step toward a comprehensive analysis of how these particular motifs mediate, via electrostatic interactions, various molecular processes such as protein sorting, translocation, docking, orientation and binding to DNA and to other proteins. Few algorithms that specifically identify these charge clusters have been designed and described in the literature [1] . In this study, 197 distinctive human viral proteomes were screened for the occurrence of charge clusters (CC) using a new computational tool. Results 373 CC have been identified within the 2549 viral protein sequences screened. The number of protein sequences that are CC-free is 2176 (85.3 %) while 150 and 180 proteins contained positive charge (PCC) and negative charge clusters (NCC), respectively. The NCCs (211 detected) were more prevalent than PCC (162). PCC-containing proteins are significantly longer than those having NCCs (p = 2. 10 16 ). The most prevalent virus families having PCC and NCC were Herpesviridae followed by Papillomaviridae. However, the single-strand RNA group has on average three times more NCC than PCC. According to the functional domain classification, a significant difference in distribution was observed between PCC and NCC (p = 2. 10 -8 ) with the occurrence of NCCs being more frequent in C-terminal region while PCC more often fall within functional domains. Only 29 proteins sequences contained both NCC and PCC. Moreover, 101 NCC were conserved in 84 proteins while only 62 PCC were conserved in 60 protein sequences.

Cancer syndrome is considered a genetic disorder in which inherited DNA polymorphisms in one or more genes make the individual susceptible to cancer development. It has been estimated that familial cancer syndromes comprises 5 to 10 percent of all types of cancer. In addition to the high risk of developing cancer, cancer syndromes often lead to the development of various independent primary tumours.

The empathy of the selected natural compounds was in the order of Luteolin > Abscisic acid > Capsaicin > Ajoene > Quercetin > Diosgenin. Luteolin formed five H-Bonds in the active site of FTO protein at GLU161, ASP299, and ASP189 (3).

Functional annotations of proteins were obtained using bioinformatics tools and pathway databases.ResultsProteins associated with functional annotations related to one or more of the search terms, namely, sperm function, motility, fertilization, stress response, acrosome reaction, and reproduction revealed 40 DEPs in infertility group, when compared with fertile group. The 35 underexpressed DEPs in the infertile men revealed dysregulation of post-translational modification, protein folding, heat-stress response, cell motility, DNA damage mediated apoptosis and mitochondrial inner membrane assembly. On the other hand, HIST1H2BA, a variant histone specifically required to direct the transformation of dissociating nucleosomes to protamine in male germ cells was overexpressed in infertile group.ConclusionsPathway analysis in our current study suggests that the dysregulated post-translational modification, protein synthesis, ubiquitination and proteosomal break down may lead to accumulation of defective proteins in the spermatozoa, which consequently could lead to compromised sperm function.

As disease symptoms at early stage are obscure and the present screening methods and biomarkers lack sensitivity for early detection of EOC more cases are unfortunately diagnosed at late stage of disease. Therefore, it is very much necessary to identify new diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers to favour early detection. Towards this cause, we attempt to identify the top canonical pathways, molecular mechanisms, disease associations and toxicological functions in EOC using systems biology.Materials and methodsGenes and molecules involved in EOC were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (Ingenuity System, Qiagen, USA) to get the global overview of signaling mechanisms in cancer and their cross associations with other diseases and functions. Core analysis of the commonly implicated genes were then performed (Fisher's Exact Test, P < 0.05). Results IPA analysis of molecules involved in EOC identified the top canonical pathways that were also associated with prostate cancer signaloverlap of EOC molecules. The top up-stream regulators identified to be involved in EOC are beta-estradiol; EGF, TP53, TGFB1 and SP1. Molecules involved in cell survival/death, cell cycle and cell growth/proliferation were 345, 183 and 353 respectively. Overlapping canonical pathways in EOC as identified by IPA are depicted inFig. 43. Of the 51 genes identified for their involvement in molecular mechanisms the most commonly involved genes and their biomarker applications are listed inTable 21.ConclusionsEarly detection of ovarian cancer is crucial for both treatment and prognosis.

Incidence rates in BC are increasing steadily in Arab countries with different age structure from US and Europe. Epidemiological studies showed 50 % of BC patients in Arab countries are below the age of 50 years compared to only 25 % in US. Young age BC patients exhibit high mortality rate with early disease relapse. There is an urge need to specify a new prognostic factor in BC young patients that can help in the selection of appropriate therapy and the assessment of patients' risk. In this study as a starting point, we used Comparative Genomic hybridization (CGH) arrays to evaluate copy number changes in twenty breast cancer patient samples. Many cytogenetic alterations were detected in our study correlated with published studies. The most frequent aberration was amplification of chromo-some1q, which was confirmed by FISH technique. Second, we used 3D digital PCR to validate amplification of 1q using two different probes in 75 BC patient samples. Finally, we assessed the correlation between the chromosomal amplification of 1q and the clinical feature of the disease.Results8 of twenty BC patients examined with CGH arrays had amplified 1q, and confirmed with FISH technique. In concordance with CGH arrays results, 32 % of seventy-five BC patients examined with 3D digital PCR showed 1q amplification. BC patient's samples with 1q amplification had correlation with large tumor size (p=. 013). Also, Univariate Kaplan-Meier survival test revealed that there is a significant association of 1q amplification and less disease free survival duration in young BC patients (p = .028).ConclusionsThis study presents 1q amplification as the most frequent aberration in BC patient's samples. In addition, the study features 1q amplification association with young BC patients (<50) with poor prognosis as indicated by less disease free survival time and large tumor size. In conclusion, 1q amplification could serve a prognosis marker for young BC patients' sample.P116 Disorders of sex chromosomes in a diagnostic genomic medicine unit in Saudi Arabia: Prevalence, diagnosis and future guidelines Basmah Al-Madoudi 1 , Bayan Al-Aslani 1 , Khulud Al-Harbi 1 , Rwan Al-Jahdali 1 , Hanadi Qudaih 1 , Emad Al Hamzy 1 , Mourad Assidi 1,2 , Mohammed Al Qahtani 1 Diagnostic Genomic Medicine Unit, Center of Excellence in Genomic Medicine Research, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; Center of Innovation in Personalized Medicine, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia Correspondence: Mourad Assidi (mourad.assidi@gmail.com) -Center of Innovation in Personalized Medicine, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia BMC Genomics 2016, 17(Suppl 6):P116", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF63": {"text": "P117Combination of WYE354 and Sunitinib demonstrate synergistic inhibition of acute myeloid leukemia in vitro Asad M Ilyas1  , Youssri Ahmed 1,2,3 , Mamdooh Gari 4 , Farid Ahmed 4 , Mohammed Alqahtani 4 Department of Biochemistry, King Abdulaziz University, Saudi Arabia; Production of Bioproducts for Industrial Applications Research Group and Experimental Biochemistry Unit, King Fahd Medical Research Center, King Abdulaziz University, Saudi Arabia; 3 Microbial Biotechnology Department, National Research Center, Dokki, Cairo, Egypt; 4 Centre for Excellence in Genomic Medicine Research, King Abdulaziz University, Saudi Arabia Correspondence: Farid Ahmed (fahmed1@kau.edu.sa) -Centre for Excellence in Genomic Medicine Research, King Abdulaziz University, Saudi Arabia BMC Genomics 2016, 17(Suppl 6):P117Background Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a clonal heterogeneous disease of myeloid progenitors which results in the accumulation of immature blast cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. Although there has been significant improvements in the survival of AML cases over the past few decades, a majority of the older AML cases and those with relapsed or secondary AML, continue to show poor outcome. The main causes attributed to failure of conventional chemotherapy in AML are treatment related mortalities and drug resistance[1].

For better understanding, surveillance studies of antimicrobial resistance is necessary to detect emerging resistances and to support management of infections in hospitals and other community sewage water pants.Materials and methodsSamples of pre and post treated water were collected from King Abdulaziz Hospital and community waste water treatment plant Jeddah. DNA was extracted by PowerMax\u00ae Soil and PowerWater\u00ae DNA Isolation kit. The extracted DNA was purified by Gel Electrophoreses and then the samples were sequenced by using V3-V4 hyper-variable region of 16S rRNA gene (MiSeq Illumina, USA).ResultsFrom 16S rRNA gene sequence we obtain 1.5 million reads from 4 samples, and each sample was process in triplicate utilizing the amplicon sequencing (MiSeq Illumina). After sequence, processing and filtration, 1.48 million of high quality sequence reads (>200 bp) were obtained and assigned to bacteria domain with an average number of 123986.9 \u00b1 49707.3 sequence reads per replicate per sample. Total 32 different phyla were identified. Phylum Proteobacteria was most dominant in both community (76 \u00b1 0.55 %) and hospital waste (51.7 % \u00b1 2.6). Density of Proteobacteria was significantly decreased to 23.5 % \u00b1 1.3 and 40.8 % \u00b1 2.3 after filtration in both samples. Bacteroidetes concentration was significantly increased from 21.9 \u00b1 0.4 % to 70.8 \u00b1 1.6 % and from 13.5 \u00b1 1.4 % to 17.4 \u00b1 3.6 % with filtration in community and in the hospital sewage respectively. Similarly, concentration of Firmicutes and Phylum Actinobacteria concentration was significantly increased with filtration in both samples. We analyzed that species specific richness, and 1651 OTUs were found at species taxonomic level classification in sequence reads. Few pathogenic i.e Shigella sonnei, Vibrio cholera, Legionella pneumophila, Coxiella burnetii, Chlamydia pneumonia and Staphylococcus aureus were present in low concentration.ConclusionsThe taxonomical diversity of bacterial species in waste water plants illustrates their resistance mechanism.Molecular characterization of Helicobacter pylori from faecal samples of Tunisian patients with gastric cancer Yosr Z Haffani 1 , Msadok Azouz 1,2 , Emna Khamla 1 , Chaima Jlassi 1 , Ahmed S.
