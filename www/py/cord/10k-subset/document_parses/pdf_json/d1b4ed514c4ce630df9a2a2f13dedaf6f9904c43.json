Animal health aspects -diseases to be considered 6.1 . OIE list of notifiable avian diseases It was agreed by all members of the working group (WG) to focus this Report (Scientific Opinion) on three major diseases that may acquire epidemic proportions. These are Newcastle disease (ND), avian influenza (AI) and avian chlamydiosis (AChl). The predominant criteria for focusing on these major three diseases were whether a given pathogen is exotic to EU countries, the ubiquity of such pathogen and its effect on animal health. A clear-cut separation of pathogens that occur in poultry and not in other avian species are desirable, but on occasions difficult to achieve. Consequently, the following text concentrates on these three pathogens and the disease they cause and identifies only those that may occur in captive birds. In addition, the presence of disease in animals can itself have a welfare impact ranging from 'severe', when animals may die over several days (e.g. pneumonia), to mild when they quickly develop an immunity after infection. Other diseases may have long-term effects with moderate adverse effects. \u2022 Types B and C have no significance for birds \u2022 The zoonotic potential of avian AIVs is generally low. However, a zoonotic potential is reported for AIVs of the current subtype H5N1. \u2022 Forms of disease due to HPAIVs are usually absent in waterfowl, whereas gallinaceous birds, birds of prey, passerine birds usually display severe signs of disease that are associated with heavy losses. \u2022 The detection of HPAIV of the subtype H5N1 does not necessarily prove a causeeffect relationship. \u2022 Chronically infected birds -especially waterfowl -may excrete AIV for periods longer than 30 days, which exceed the minimum quarantine period.. \u2022 Commercial poultry are vaccinated using inactivated or vector vaccines in some countries that export captive birds. \u2022 The stability of AIV outside the natural hosts is low. Disinfection is readily achieved with available disinfectants. \u2022 Birds that tested positive for HPAI and LPAIV of the subtypes H5 and H7 should be destroyed. \u2022 The orders of birds imported in the largest numbers (passeriformes and psittaciformes) do not play a major role in the epidemiology of AI. \u2022 HPAIVs are not pathogenic for most of the imported bird species that belong to anseriformes. Therefore relying on clinical signs in quarantine stations will not detect any form of disease. \u2022 All HPAI viruses as they are present in birds of any susceptible species have been shown to have restricted zoonotic potential. However, since the genome (or parts thereof, of the AIVs has been involved in severe pandemics in the past (and currently due to HPAIV of the subtype H5N1) a good surveillance program can prevent relevant AIVs to come into the EU through legal imported birds. \u2022 Reassortments of differing AIV strains are likely in persistantly infected birds.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1079, "end": 1082, "text": "6.1", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Recommendations on the Captive Wild Bird Pathway"}, {"text": "\u2022 Newcastle disease is a highly contagious disease and can be transmitted by direct physical contact, indirectly through the air, drinking water or faeces and by living and mechanical vectors. \u2022 At least four pathotypes (velo-, meso-, lento-and apathogenic) and more than seven genotypes exist within the species Paramyxovirus 1 (PMV-1) of Newcastle disease viruses.

Also, because this RA is a general assessment of the captive bird pathway, which covers all species and methods of capture,etc, a range of values is given in places, particularly for duration and consequence, Some of the various causes of poor welfare, in birds that may or may not die prior to arrival at point of sale to those who will keep them as pets, are as follows; fear during capture; pain during capture; pain etc. as a result of injury during attempted capture; starvation of young birds whose parents have been captured or killed; fear, frustration and extreme discomfort in birds trapped with glue; dehydration, starvation and extremes of temperature in trapped birds; fear, pain, dehydration, starvation and extremes of temperature during holding after capture and transport in the country of origin; inability to fulfil needs during housing in inadequate conditions if captive bred; fear, pain, dehydration, starvation and extremes of temperature during transport to the E.U., holding on arrival in the E.U., transport within the E.U. and holding prior to sale. determined as a result of studies of their biology and form the basis of the risk analysis in this report. \u2022 The justification for continuing the importation of these birds should be carefully considered, because the welfare is very poor and there is no indication that measures can be put in place to adequately protect their welfare at all stages \u2022 During the captive bird pathway, several hazards lead to adverse consequences that can be very serious for the welfare of the birds.

However, it must be stressed that only one study supports this statement. \u2022 The overall mortality of wild-caught birds from the beginning of the capture procedure to arrival at the point of sale to those who keep them as pets can vary greatly depending on the species, but is generally high and can be over 70% on the basis of data in published papers \u2022 Mortality figures for captive wild birds are very much higher than those for mortality of domestic livestock during handling, transport and keeping that occur in any other area of human usage of animals. \u2022 The death of wild-caught birds is usually preceded by a period of poor welfare.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Welfare risk assessment"}, {"text": "\u2022 The likelihood of poor welfare in birds taken from the wild is very much greater than in birds that have been bred in captivity because the wild-caught birds are more disturbed by human presence and adapt much less well to confinement.

In South America parrots are often taken from nests in trees which are cut down to allow access or nesting holes are broken into and destroyed to allow access to nestlings.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Fledglings"}, {"text": "A high proportion of birds in an area may be affected; for example, one study in Thailand (Archawaranon, 2003) reported that more than 60% of hatchlings of the hill Mynah were taken by humans for the pet trade. Although Thailand is not a major exporter of Mynah birds to the EU, this example illustrates the local impact that may arise from wild bird capture. Two methods have been described for the collection of parrot nestlings in the Peruvian Amazon (Gonzalez, 2003) ; for species that nest high, the nesting trees are cut down and for lower nesters the nest cavity is hacked open. The cutting down of trees may result in the death of other nestlings from unwanted species and tree and nest cavity destruction reduces the available nesting options. Gonzalez (2003) found that the mean mortality rate for nestlings was 0-8% in Amazon parrots and 14.3-48.4% in macaws. Species that nested higher had higher mortality rates. Mortality rates for blue and yellow macaws (Ara ararauna) were particularly high with 48.4% dying during harvesting (see table 8.1). In a review of 23 studies of nesting success of parrots the mean poaching rate was 30% across all studies and ranged from around 90% to zero depending on species. The price paid for parrots influenced the rate of nest poaching (Wright et al., 2000) . Nesting cavities were not destroyed during capture of grey parrots in Central Africa but were visited annually and the nestlings taken (Juste, 1996) . However in a CITES and IUCN supported study Clemmons (2002) reported that in Guinea-Bissau some trappers took African grey parrots nestlings either by cutting down the tree, or climbing up to the nest and removing the birds manually or using a stick with bird lime on it. Some tied the nestlings into the nest and came back later to remove the birds. The preferred age of capture was one month. In Guinea trappers captured adult and juvenile birds using three methods; (1) trapping sleeping birds over rivers using a flashlight and knocking the bird into the water and then retrieving it, (2) glue on sticks with a decoy parrot, (3) snares placed on trees between landing spot and food. They also took nestlings (Clemmons, 2002) but preferred to take adults as mortality rates were lower in the latter. On Principe grey parrot nestlings are taken at the end of the nesting period (Juste, 1996) . Both McGowan (2001) and Juste (1996) reported that because of the competition between trappers some nestlings are taken earlier and this may result in higher mortality. In one small sample, the mortality rates of African grey parrots captured in Nigeria were about 43% with the trapper (22/51) and about 3 or 4 birds died from every 10 received by the dealer (McGowan, 2001) . McGowan (2001) concluded that about 2/3 of all African grey parrots trapped would die before reaching a market.

Studies in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the UK and the USA showed a decline in mortality from 7.2% in 1982 to 1.4% in 1996 1.4% in (Meyers, 1998 . Mortality rates were lower for psittacines and large birds and remained at about 1% for 10 years (Meyers, 1998) . On the basis of an extensive sample of more than 6 million birds, Sch\u00fctz (2003) showed that the average transport mortality of birds transported by air was 1.36% but that this varied between species and five families (Alcedinidae, Nectariniidae, Aegithaldidae, Trochilidae and Jacanidae) had mean mortality rates above 5%.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 146, "end": 174, "text": "(Ashton and Alexander, 1980;", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 175, "end": 188, "text": "Ashton, 1984)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 355, "end": 367, "text": "1.4% in 1996", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 368, "end": 389, "text": "1.4% in (Meyers, 1998", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 489, "end": 503, "text": "(Meyers, 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF263"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Requirements imposed by the EU on third countries that wish to export"}, {"text": "The EFSA Transport Report (2004) concluded that there were more problems before transport than during transport for wild caught birds but that the treatment in the pre-transport period could adversely affect the ability of surviving birds to cope with stressors encountered during and after the transport. Thus, transport mortality could be somewhat higher for wild caught species than for captive bred species (Vinke, 1998) . She also reported that all transports fulfilling IATA guidelines could be characterised as good but that deficiencies were identified in most of those that did not meet IATA guidelines. Maas (2000) quoted figures for birds dead on arrival (DOAs) after international transport and showed that DOAs in the various studies varied from 1 to15%. Transport mortality appeared to be proportional to the number of birds in a container, bird density [floor space and perch space per bird], consignment size and transport time (Jensen, 1991; Lindley, 1995) and there was some indication that larger groups and longer journeys led to a greater mortality than smaller groups and shorter journeys. Country of origin, number of species per consignment and the quality of the post-export quarantine facilities also affected the extent of bird mortality. Sch\u00fctz (2003) also indicated that mortality rate was higher for smaller bird species of lesser value that were transported in larger groups. This author also found that typically high average mortality rates were due to certain transports with very high mortality (up to 100%) and showed that 0.4% of transports had mortality rates greater than 50%. In 64% of bird transports, the mortality was zero. Transport mortality in CITES species was significantly lower than in non-CITES species (0.90 v. 2.25%) and none of the 28 non-CITES species investigated had a mortality of zero. Even in species with a mortality < 1% there were repeated cases of shipments > 15% dead individuals on arrival.

In humans, gastroenteritis is the most common clinical syndrome caused by Salmonella. Those most seriously affected are infants, children, and the elderly. Antibiotics are generally contraindicated for human salmonellosis, except in cases of prolonged fever or septicaemia, because they may prolong the carrier period and cause antibiotic-insensitive strains to emerge.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 579, "end": 606, "text": "(Butterfield, et al., 1983)", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Other potential (re)emerging diseases"}, {"text": "Campylobacter jejuni has a worldwide distribution and is the most commonly reported bacterial cause of foodborne infection in in humans (Altekruse, et al., 1999) .

In rather rare instances infections by Chlamydophila pneumoniae are possible. Siemers (1999) Chlamydiosis is the most common and the most well-known direct zoonosis from birds (Dorrestein and Hage, 1999) . Up to the year 2000 almost 30% of the publications in PubMed were related to chlamydiosis. C. psittaci is endemic worldwide, where it is distributed liberally among free-ranging birds. As a rule, the organism is well adapted to avian hosts and causes few, if any, clinical signs or pathologic lesions. Clinical disease is precipitated mainly by human-induced conditions and procedures. Chlamydiosis has been documented in at least 160 avian host species, nearly a quarter of which are psittacines. From the 114 species of freeliving wild birds that are proven to carry chlamydia, 23% were Charadriiformes, 22% Passeriformes and 16% Anseriformes (Brand, 1989) . A survey of imported and domestically bred Psittaciformes as well as free-ranging and captive raptors and owls from Germany indicate that between 30 and 70% of the birds tested are positive . C. psittaci strains from Psittaciformes, domesticated ducks (in Europe) and turkeys (in USA) appear to cause the most severe disease in humans. It appears that the host animal in which chlamydial passage occurs prior to the human infection influences the pathogenicity of the agent for humans. Parrots and other psittacine birds still are regarded as the major reservoir of the infectious agent and most recognized cases are associated with owing pet birds or working in a pet store. It was once thought that birds imported from abroad, often illegally, were a principal source, but many domestic breeder flocks of pet birds now have become infected (Gregory and Schaffner, 1997) . Pigeon strains of chlamydia are considered less virulent for humans. Reports of psittacosis in man related to wild birds are rare. Kaleta and Taday (2003) reviewed the avian host range and demonstrated that all domestic avian species (chickens, turkeys, Pekin and Muscovy ducks, geese, pigeons, Guinea fowl, pea fowl Japanese and bobwhite quail) can be carriers of chlamydia. In addition, at least 460 other avian species of free-living and pet birds were positive for Chlamydia, including all species that are currently imported into the EU. It appears that chlamydia infected birds do not necessarily suffer from disease. Many sampled breeding tits were found to be infected but continued to breed successfully (Holzinger-Umlauf et al., 1999) . Clements (2000) lists a total of 27 orders that comprise altogether 9.748 avian species. These include 3.967 non-passerine species and 5.781 passerine species. Among the existing species only rather few of them are targets for capture and subsequent export. The total number of birds within each species is unknown. Also unknown is the number of chlamydial isolations per species because these are not published. Therefore, the exact proportion of chlamydia-positive birds per species remains undetermined.

Transmission of AI between birds can occur as a result of direct contact, or as a result with faecally contaminated surfaces or objects, and in a cramped transport environment the opportunity for both types of transmission occurs. As compared to NDV, AIVs in faecal material are sensitive to inactivation by UV-radiation (sunlight), dry environment (many passerine birds originate from steppe-like countries), pH below 5.o and above 12.o and cleaning / disinfectant solutions. AIVs are present in the pharynx of infected birds. Since the beak is extensively used by birds for pruning, AIV is spread over all feathers and can be detected subsequently on feathers and feather dust for up to two to four days. The rate of survival of AIV on feathers depends on the amount and composition of fat that birds derive from the uropygeal gland. Virus survival is particularily high in waterfowl that perform more frequently pruning than terrestrial birds do. In contrast, AIVs retain their infectivity for weeks and month in frozen material (blood, meat, bone marrow) that is used as source for food for day-and night-raptors, vultures and other carnivorous birds.

An exporter is likely to hold birds until he has a large enough number to export and so crowded conditions at this point in the chain may result. In Guinea, for example, dealers claim that birds are sometimes retained for six months or longer while waiting for exportation (Clemmons, 2003) . Also, African grey parrots that were removed as young fledglings from their nests are kept for some months until grown-up and \"ready\" for transport (Graeber, M. 1994, vet. dissertation, Univ. Giessen) . It is plausible that smaller birds, as a result of their lesser monetary value, will receive less stringent care and therefore may be exposed to greater risk. Again, the bird in question being a member of a susceptible family is also a factor. The transmissibility of avian influenza virus is influenced by a number of factors (see section 9.3.2.3) ; transmission is likely to be via the faecal/pharyngeal oral route, with a moist, cool, neutral pH environment favouring survival. If a susceptible bird [permissive for AIV replication], therefore, is placed in such a favourable environment, transmission has the opportunity to occur. Recent experimental data using chickens (Brown, 2006, pers. com.) suggests that transmission of AIV in a fairly closed environment was relatively ineffective (see section on sentinel birds); this is the only transmission data which has been identified and does not completely reflect the conditions which might be experienced at a holding station in the third country.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 537, "end": 553, "text": "(Clemmons, 2003)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 704, "end": 756, "text": "(Graeber, M. 1994, vet. dissertation, Univ.

Trichobilharzia szidati (Syn T. ocellata) (Haas and Pietsch, 1991) probably enters lymphatic or venous vessels in the skin and continues via the lungs and systemic circulation to the hepatic-portal system as the final location Haas and Pietsch, 1991; Hor\u00e1k and Kol\u00e1rov\u00e1, 2000) . Trichobilharzia regenti and T. szidati can infect mammalian hosts via a percutaneous route, but neither matures successfully. However, some larvae can reach the lungs (T. szidati) (Hor\u00e1k and Kol\u00e1rov\u00e1, 2000) or the spinal cord and brain (T. regenti), where they cause pulmonary and neuromotor disorders, respectively Kol\u00e1rov\u00e1 et al., 2001) . The fate of nonmaturing larvae in mammals is not fully known, although it is suggested that most of them die in the skin .

Wading birds, including ingest infective eggs, larvae will hatch, enter the wall of the small intestine, and subsequently develop to adult worms in the small bowel. However, ingestion of eggs by other host animals results in extra intestinal migration of larvae (Hamann et al., 1989) . Raccoons may also become infected when they eat larvae that have become encapsulated in the tissues of rodents and other animals (Kazakos and Boyce, 1989) . Some times, partial or complete development of Baylisascaris adults can take place in animals other than raccoons but it is unknown how often this happens in nature and how these animals became infected (whether by ingestion of infective eggs or larvae in other intermediate hosts) (Greve and O'Brien, 1989) . A wide range of species of wild birds has been found to be susceptible to larva migrans caused by B. procyonis. A study of the prevalence of larva migrans in free-ranging wildlife in California found that 87 birds of 18 species had NLM or VLM or both (Evans, 2002) . It is conceivable that imported captive birds infected with B. procyonis may become pray to raccoons and other animals and transmit the disease to local animal fauna. In fact B. procyonis was recently introduced in the raccoon population in the metropolitan Atlanta area, Georgia, USA, even though the infection had been absent from this region of the southeastern United States. No explanation of why this would be happening at this time is obvious but geographic movement of other infectious diseases has been linked to legal or illegal movement of natural host animals for a variety of purposes (Eberhard et al., 2003) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 139, "end": 158, "text": "(Chai et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 423, "end": 444, "text": "(Hamann et al., 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF159"}, {"start": 576, "end": 601, "text": "(Kazakos and Boyce, 1989)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 886, "end": 911, "text": "(Greve and O'Brien, 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF150"}, {"start": 1165, "end": 1178, "text": "(Evans, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 1779, "end": 1802, "text": "(Eberhard et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Gymnophalloides seoi Not endemic in the Netherlands"}, {"text": "Trichinella pseudospiralis belongs to the non-encapsulated species of the genus Trichinella that shows a wider host spectrum than other Trichinella species, which includes mammals and birds, because it can complete its life cycle at host body temperatures ranging from 37 to 42 \u00b0C (Pozio et al., 2004) . Infection with T. pseudospiralis is acquired by ingestion of raw meat from infected animals.

They have been reported related to disease in birds (Bauck, 1994) . C. neoformans is isolated frequently from the droppings of pigeons, starlings or other avian species. Histoplasma spp. grows readily in soil and appear as a white-to-brown molt. This organism has been associated with or found in the feces of chickens, blackbirds, pigeons and gulls. This fungus could potentially proliferate in enclosed aviaries with dirt floors and transport cages.
