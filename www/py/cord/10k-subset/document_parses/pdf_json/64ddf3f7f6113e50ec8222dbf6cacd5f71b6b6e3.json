However, it is gradually being phased out from clinical use against malaria due to emergence of CQ-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains. Besides low cost and tolerability, ongoing research has revealed interesting biochemical properties of CQ that have inspired its repurposing/repositioning in the management of various infectious/noninfectious diseases. Consequently, several novel compounds and compositions based on its scaffold have been studied and patented. Areas covered: In this review, patents describing CQ and its derivatives/ compositions over the last 5 years are analyzed. The review highlights the rationale, chemical structures, biological evaluation and potential therapeutic application of CQ, its derivatives and compositions. Expert opinion: Repurposing efforts have dominantly focused on racemic CQ with no studies exploring the effect of the (R) and (S) enantiomers, which might potentially have additional benefits in other diseases. Additionally, evaluating other similarly acting antimalarials in clinical use and structural analogs could help maximize the intrinsic value of the 4-aminoquinolines. With regard to cancer therapy, successful repurposing of CQ-containing compounds will require linking the mode of action of these antimalarials with the signaling pathways that drive cancer cell proliferation to facilitate the development of a 4-amino-7-chloroquinoline that can be used as a synergistic partner in anticancer combination chemotherapy.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Chloroquine (N\u00a2-(7-chloroquinolin-4-yl)-N,N-diethyl-pentane-1,4-diamine) (1, Figure 1 ) is a 4-aminoquinoline compound first synthesized in 1934 by Johann (Hans) Andersag and co-workers at Bayer I.G.

However, during World War II, the US government sponsored clinical trials that demonstrated the therapeutic value of chloroquine (CQ) as an antimalarial and its superiority over existing drugs, thereby heralding its widespread use in the treatment and prevention of different forms of malaria [2, 3] . The antimalarial activity of CQ is thought to occur in the parasite digestive vacuole (DV) where degradation of the host erythrocyte hemoglobin leads to release of the toxic waste product, iron (II) protoporphyrin IX (FeIIPPIX), which undergoes auto oxidation to the equally toxic iron (III) protoporphyrin IX (FeIIIPPIX) or hematin [4] . The parasite, however, can adapt by detoxifying hematin to a dimerized nontoxic hemozoin form. CQ interferes with this dimerization and detoxification of hematin, thereby impeding hemozoin formation [5] , leading to inhibition of parasite growth. The exact killing mechanism is not well understood albeit the peroxidation of parasite lipid membranes, damage of DNA and oxidation of proteins are implicated in parasite death [6] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 438, "end": 441, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 442, "end": 444, "text": "3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 780, "end": 783, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 985, "end": 988, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1210, "end": 1213, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "For many years thereafter, CQ was successfully used as the primary chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment and prevention of malaria caused by different Plasmodium species, owing to its relatively low cost, high efficacy and ready availability. However, in 1961, the first case of a CQ-resistant (CQR) Plasmodium falciparum strain was reported in Colombia [7] with more cases increasingly reported over subsequent years from various malaria endemic regions [8] . Consequently, by early 2000, CQ had been largely replaced by mefloquine (2) (MEF), sulfadoxine (3)-pyrimethamine (4) (SP) and later artemisinin (5)-or artesunate (ART) (6)-based combination therapies (ACTs) as the treatment of choice for falciparum malaria.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 357, "end": 360, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 458, "end": 461, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Nevertheless, despite the decline in CQ efficacy as an antimalarial, the World Health Organization (WHO) in its current malaria treatment guidelines still recommends its use, in combination with primaquine (PRM), as the preferred treatment option in the management of uncomplicated malaria caused by sensitive P. vivax strains [9] .

For example, by the early 1960s, results of clinical trials to investigate the efficacy of CQ in the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were already being reported [11] . Based on the findings of such trials, CQ and its derivative, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (7), are both still in clinical use as disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) [12] . Its usefulness in the management of other auto-immune conditions such as lupus erythematosus (LE) was similarly recognized as early as the 1950s based on observations using related antimalarials such as quinine (8) (QN) and quinacrine (9) (QNR) (Figure 2 ) [13] . Since then, numerous clinical evidence have confirmed the beneficial role of CQ and HCQ in treating LE even during pregnancy [14] . More recently, CQ and its analogs have been the subject of intense interest in the development of safe and effective cancer drugs. It has been implicated in modifying cell differentiation as well as in the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of autophagy in different cancer cell lines [15] .

For instance, to circumvent amodiaquine (AQ) (10)-induced idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity arising from the reactive quinone-imine metabolite due to CYP-catalyzed oxidation, the University of Liverpool in 2006 patented AQ analogs, with the chemical structure 11 (Figure 4 ), lacking the potential to form reactive metabolites via the quinoneimine pathway, while retaining the potent antimalarial activity [17] . Among these, isoquine (12) K1 (IC 50 : 6 nM vs 25 nM) P. falciparum strains. This in vitro potency was also translated into in vivo activity in the rodent malaria model P. yoelii on oral administration in the standard 4-day test resulting in a mean half-maximal effective dose (ED 50 ) of 2.7 mg/kg for compound 12 compared to 7.7 mg/kg for AQ. The potency of this compound has also been confirmed against clinical isolates from a malariaendemic region with a median half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) value of 9 nM compared to 56 nM for CQ [18] . The increase in potency and decrease in dose would be expected to reduce the potential toxicity of the compounds claimed in this invention. Another approach involves structural re-engineering of existing drugs by, for instance, coupling them to resistance reversers. In 2013, Portland State University patented CQderivatives referred to as 'reversed chloroquines' (RCQs), which are hybrid molecules covalently linking a CQ-like (inhibitory) moiety and a resistance reversal moiety [19] . Examples of the RCQs are shown in Figure 5 (13--18). The resistance reversal moiety is thought to sensitize CQR parasites to the inhibitory moiety by reducing the efflux of the CQ moiety from the parasite's DV. This covalent linking is believed to enhance the local concentration of either or both drugs to effectively inhibit growth of CQR or CQS parasite strains. The feasibility of this approach has since been confirmed by other studies, some of which have generated even more potent modifications of the prototype molecule [20, 21] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 628, "end": 632, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 657, "end": 661, "text": "(12)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1188, "end": 1192, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1676, "end": 1680, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2211, "end": 2215, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2216, "end": 2219, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 485, "end": 494, "text": "(Figure 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1717, "end": 1725, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Patents review"}, {"text": "The RCQs exhibited better in vitro activity against CQS and CQR strains as summarized in Table 1 .

Although the patent does not describe the rationale behind these conjugates, it has detailed the synthetic procedures of the same. The University of South Florida in 2010 patented drug delivery systems that use polyacrylate nanoparticles to overcome difficulties encountered in delivery of resistance reversal agents to the site of action [25] . In this case, the reversal agent and/or CQ were first converted to an acrylated derivative using butyl acrylate and styrene at a drug concentration of 1% w/w. To pre-emulsify the mixture, 3% w/w sodium dodecyl sulfate in purified water was added with rapid stirring. The resulting homogenous solution of micelles was then treated with potassium persulfate (1% w/w), a watersoluble radical initiator, to induce free radical polymerization. The resulting emulsion contained uniformly sized polyacrylate nanoparticles in which the drug is covalently incorporated directly into the polymeric matrix of the nanoparticle.

Previous studies have demonstrated enhanced activity against CQR P. falciparum by compounds derived from modification of the CQ side chain: shortening or lengthening of the alkyl chain between the two amino groups to 2 --3 or 10 --12 carbon atoms; incorporation of a phenol moiety and incorporation of an intramolecular hydrogen bonding motif [27] . Introduction of a branched dialkylamino motif at the terminal N of CQ side chain has been reported to yield metabolically more stable antimalarials with retained activity against drug-resistant strains of P. falciparum [28] . The in vitro antiplasmodial activities of some of these derivatives on CQS and CQR P. falciparum strains are summarized in Table 2 . As indicated in the table, some structural changes led to compounds with better activity than CQ while others resulted in loss of activity [26] . A 2011 patent by Nagoya City University claimed compounds with antimalarial activity represented by the general chemical structure 45 ( Figure 9 ) [29] . The compounds are claimed to have higher efficacy than CQ due to enhanced binding affinity to heme attributable to structural modifications on CQ to introduce groups capable of electrostatic interaction with heme and coordination to the iron atom of heme, besides the -pi-pi stacking of the quinoline nucleus with heme. The antiplasmodial activity of compound 46 against the FCR3 strain was superior (EC 50 = 6.6 nM) to that of CQ, QN, MEF and artemisinin.

Nonetheless, evidence supporting the antiviral activity of CQ-based compounds has been persuasive. CQ may exert additive or synergistic effects when associated with other anti-HIV drugs such as didanosine, zidovudine and hydroxyurea.

Within the context of repurposing of CQ, most studies appear to be based largely on the use of racemic CQ with no studies focusing on the effect of the respective (R) and (S) enantiomers. While in malaria the two enantiomers and the racemate are equipotent, presumably due to an achiral heme target, the same may not hold for other diseases where the mechanism of action of CQ may not involve an achiral target. Thus independent evaluation of the (R) and (S) forms of CQ may reveal additional benefits. Furthermore, in order to maximize the intrinsic value of the 4-aminoquinoline class of drugs, studies undertaken should also be extended to other clinically used related acridine and 4-aminoquinoline antimalarials that share the same mechanism of action with CQ. These include the acridine pyronaridine and 4-aminoquinoline piperaquine, which represent the two most advanced 4-amino-7-chloroquinoline drugs in the clinic. On the other hand, analog-based design based on modification of the lateral side chain of CQ has been a successful endeavor in delivering 4-amino-7-chloroquinoline agents that address drug resistance and/or toxicity in malaria. The most advanced of these are FQ and AQ-13, which share closer structural similarities to CQ. Of these, only FQ has reached Phase II human trials. AQ-13, a simple truncated CQ analog has been shown to overcome the CQ clinical resistance due to P. falciparum CQ resistance transporter [95] . In spite of the varying degrees of success of CQ-derived compounds such as FQ, AQ-13 and AQ derivatives such as napthoquine and tert-butyl isoquine [96] in the clinic, the current limitations associated with the CQ-derived 4-aminoquinoline class of compounds include safety concerns and the requirement for relatively high doses. Cardiovascular or CNS effects, reactive metabolite formation and low clinical therapeutic ratio are the typical safety issues associated with 4-amino-7-chloroquinoline compounds. Although thousands of 4-amino-7-chloroquinolines have been synthesized, there has been limited structural diversity as the overwhelming majority, including compounds covered in this review, share the 7-chloroquinoline core scaffold and differ mainly in the 4-amino substituent. The 7-chloroquinoline core scaffold seems to be a major contributor to the aforementioned safety issues. As such any new 4-amino-7-chloroquinolines are unlikely to have significant differences in their properties and safety profiles albeit it may yet be possible to design a 4-amino-7-chloroquinoline with diminished risk for cardiotoxicity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1672, "end": 1676, "text": "[95]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1827, "end": 1831, "text": "[96]", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Expert opinion"}, {"text": "To potentially circumvent the above mentioned current limitations associated with the CQ-derived 4-aminoquinoline class of compounds, the use of computer-aided drug discovery approaches such as scaffold hopping, pharmacophore modeling and virtual screening may lead to new chemical entities with improved properties and safety profiles over classical 7-chloroquinolines. Regarding pharmacophore modeling, it is noteworthy that the crude pharmacophore for 4-aminoquinoline antimalarials is known [96] . In this model compounds have a bi-or tri-cyclic lipophilic electron-deficient aryl ring systems for -pi-pi stacking of the nuclei with heme and also have terminal pendant basic groups to both increase accumulation in the DV as well as to interact with heme propionates.
