Approximately 100 DUBs exist in human cells and are involved in key regulatory cellular processes, which drive many disease states, making them attractive therapeutic targets. Several aspects of DUB biology have been studied through genetic knock-out or knock-down, genomic, or proteomic studies. However, investigation of enzyme activation and regulation requires additional tools to monitor cellular and physiological dynamics. A comparison between genetic ablation and dominant-negative target validation with pharmacological inhibition often leads to striking discrepancies. Activity probes have been used to profi le classes of enzymes, including DUBs, and allow functional and dynamic properties to be assigned to individual proteins. The ability to directly monitor DUB activity within a native biological system is essential for understanding the physiological and pathological role of individual DUBs. We will discuss the evolution of DUB activity probes, from in vitro assay development to their use in monitoring DUB activity in cells and in animal tissues, as well as recent progress and prospects for assessing DUB inhibition in vivo.",

Activation involves covalent linkage between the carboxy terminus of ubiquitin and a cysteine residue present on the E1, forming a thioester bond. The activated ubiquitin is then transferred to an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme forming a thioester linkage. In the fi nal step, an E3 ligase transfers the ubiquitin from the E2 to the substrate protein. The majority of E3 ligases are classifi ed as RING fi nger E3s and act by bringing the substrate and E2 enzyme in close proximity. The RING fi nger E3s directly transfer ubiquitin from the E2 to the substrate. The HECT domain E3s act by forming an intermediate thioester linkage with ubiquitin before transfer to the substrate (reviewed in [ 5 ] ). More recently, a third class of E3 ligases with an intermediate mechanism of action has been identifi ed. The RING-in-between-RING (RBR) E3s are an unusual family of ubiquitin E3-ligases composed of a dozen proteins. Their activities are autoinhibited, causing a requirement for activation by protein-protein interactions or posttranslational modifi cations . They catalyze ubiquitin conjugation by a concerted RING/HECT-like mechanism in which the RING1 domain facilitates E2-discharge to directly form a thioester intermediate with a cysteine in RING2. This short-lived, HECT-like intermediate then modifi es the target [ 6 , 7 ] .",

Of the most well studied linkages, K63-linked polyubiquitin chains are often involved in nonproteolytic signal transduction while K48linked chains generally target substrates for proteasomal degradation. A number of additional linkages such as Met1, K6, K11, K27, K29, and K33 have been identifi ed and their nondegradative cellular signaling roles are still subject to a number of investigations. The complexity of ubiquitin chain signaling is further enhanced by the existence of mixed-lineage chains [ 8 , 9 ] .",

Proteins that have been appropriately polyubiquitylated are recognized and degraded by the 26S macromolecular proteasome complex [ 11 ] . The 26S complex consists of a 20S catalytic core particle that is capped at both ends by 19S regulatory particles . The 19S regulatory particle can be further subdivided into lid and base components. Following recruitment to the proteasome, polyubiquitylated proteins undergo deubiquitylation and unfolding. The removal of ubiquitin is accomplished by deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) associated with the 19S lid. Ubiquitin polypeptides that are removed from substrate proteins can be directly recycled by the cell. The 19S base component plays a key role in the unfolding of the substrate protein and delivery of the deubiquitylated, unfolded protein into the 20S catalytic core particle. The 20S consists of four layers of ring-like structures [ 12 ] . The outer rings are composed of seven \u03b1 subunits with the inner rings composed of seven \u03b2 subunits. The \u03b21 subunits exhibit caspase-like activity, the \u03b22 subunits trypsin-like activity, and \u03b25 subunits chymotrypsin-like activity, collectively degrading proteins into short oligopeptides as well as recycling amino acids [ 5 , 13 ] .",

A number of conceptual and technological obstacles need to be overcome in order to progress genuine DUB therapies. A major challenge in characterization of DUB inhibitors is the development of high throughput assays monitoring \"on-target\" inhibition in cells and in vivo. Monitoring DUB target engagement by small molecule inhibitors in vivo has a number of implications. Firstly, as a biomarker readout of inhibition and for understanding the physiological implication of inhibiting a class of enzymes for which there is usually no known unique ubiquitylated substrate. Secondly, for assessment of the selectivity of compounds as well as understanding the mechanism of action of the inhibition, including duration, reversibility, and pharmacodynamic parameters.",

ABPs are usually composed of a reactive electrophile, to covalently modify an active-site residue, and a reporter group to allow detection of the labeled enzyme [ 28 ] , see Fig. 1a , b . Activity probes have been designed for a number of enzyme classes such as serine hydrolases [ 29 ] , metalloproteases [ 30 , 31 ] , proteasomes [ 32 ] , and oxidoreductases [ 33 ] . Epitope-tagged ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like derivatives have been utilized in a variety of assays to identify or monitor active DUBs in biological samples [ 34 , 35 ] (Fig. 1c ) . Ubiquitin ABPs have been instrumental in the identifi cation of a number of new DUBs [ 36 ] including a novel class of DUBs: OTUs [ 37 ] . Unlike other proteolytic enzymes, for optimal recognition, DUBs require not only an electrophilic trap but also a very large portion of ubiquitin or chains of ubiquitin for binding and recognition in the enzyme active site: truncated portions of ubiquitin are usually not suffi cient to trap DUBs. In addition, the isopeptide nature of the covalent linkage of ubiquitin to the target protein Monitoring the activity of endogenous enzymes such as DUBs in their native, full-length status as well as under all possible naturally occurring posttranslational modifi cations or interference/allosteric regulation from binding partners is a major advantage of ABPs . The irreversible covalent nature of ABPs toward their enzyme targets has a number of advantages when compared to many other analytical technologies that rely on weak, naturally transient and diffi cult to capture interactions between an enzyme and its substrate. Various warheads (Fig. 2 ) have been employed including alkyl halides (chloroethyl, bromoethyl, bromopropyl), Michael acceptors ( vinyl methyl ester (VME) , vinyl methyl sulfone (VMS) , vinyl phenyl sulfone, vinyl cyanide) and more recently propargyl (PA) [ 36 , 38 , 39 ] .",

In the Ubiquitin-AQUA approach, synthetic isotopically labeled internal standard peptides are used to quantify branched peptides and the branched -GG signature peptides generated by trypsin digestion of ubiquitin signals [ 55 ] . Proteomic studies looking at DUB interaction partners have also generated a great deal of information about their substrates, regulation, and function [ 56 ] .

While such studies are very informative and have generated a wealth of data on the biological roles of DUBs, they provide only limited information regarding the dynamic activity profi le of DUBs, and are not able to distinguish the catalytic state (active versus inactive) of DUBs. As the cellular activity of DUBs can be controlled by multiple factors including protein interactions [ 61 ] , stoichiometric changes to the structure of the protein [ 62 , 63 ] , and posttranslational modifi cations [ 64 , 65 ] , the advantage of activity probes is their specifi c reactivity with catalytically active DUBs .",

An independent study using another USP7 inhibitor displaying selectivity in a panel of biochemical DUB assays, was also subjected to cellular selectivity profi ling using HA-Ub-VMS followed by immunoblotting [ 24 ] . In a more targeted approach, an active-site ubiquitin probe (HA-Ub-VMS) has been used to demonstrate that USP14/UCHL5 inhibition by a small molecule (b-AP15) inhibits the 19S proteasome in a reconstituted biochemical assay. A similar probe approach was also used to demonstrate that b-AP15 is not a general inhibitor of DUBs in a cell lysate probed with an anti-HA antibody detecting the conjugated ubiquitin species [ 67 ] . While the studies mentioned above are paving the way for elucidating DUB selectivity profi les in a cellular context, coverage of the \" DUBome \" is still limited.

However, incorporation of electrophilic warheads into polyubiquitin chains remains problematic. An intermediate approach to the generation of polyubiquitin ABPs was elaborated on the basis of the synthesis of branched-peptides incorporating an isopeptide-linked ubiquitin and an electrophilic warhead [ 84 ] . In addition, the synthesis and characterization of K48or K63-linked di-ubiquitin probes bearing dehydroalanine as a warhead near the isopeptide bond has been described [ 85 ] . Finally, ABPs engineered for di-ubiquitin chains incorporating the 8 known ubiquitin linkages have been successful and now allow DUB ubiquitinlinkage specifi city in a cellular context to be addressed [ 86 -88 ] . Structural studies of DUBs with di-ubiquitin have demonstrated that in addition to the peptide fl anking the ubiquitylated residues, more extensive interactions between DUBs and the proximal ubiquitin in the chain also contribute to the recognition by DUBs. Probing DUB selectivity with the latest generation of probes not only generates a distinct pattern from that obtained using mono-ubiquitin ABPs, but also suggests that the promiscuity of some DUBs for their substrates is probably much less pronounced than initially anticipated.",

Some DUBs have very well characterized substrates (e.g., USP1 or USP7) [ 15 ] that are clearly linked to the function of the DUBs, however, the known substrate specifi city is still relatively poor or partial at best for most DUBs. In certain cases, it is quite clear that unique substrates do not exist: e.g., USP14 or UCHL5 are DUBs that indiscriminately recognize any ubiquitylated substrates which is targeted to the proteasome [ 93 ] . Ubiquitin ABPs can play a critical role as tools to monitor the dynamics of the activation or inhibition of DUBs under specifi c physiological or pharmacological pathway alterations. The problem is especially acute for the monitoring of DUB activity upon inhibition with specifi c inhibitors: the pharmaceutical development of DUB inhibitors requires a good understanding of the pharmacokinetic modulation of the target upon treatment with compounds. The development of ABPs for proteomic evaluation of target engagement is currently being investigated by a number of groups. In addition, higher throughput ABP-based strategies are also under development for the determination of DUB target engagement in cellular contexts as well as in tissues or eventually for clinical sample evaluation (Fig. 3 ) .

            "text": "The development of activity probes for DUBs has lagged behind the development of probes for more classical proteases. Indeed, the complexity of the recognition site of DUBs, which requires the binding of full-length ubiquitin in the catalytic site as well as the challenges in the characterization of potent and selective DUB inhibitors , has hindered production of ABPs for DUBs. However, following on from the ground-breaking evolution of cell-permeable and in vivo-compatible activity-based imaging probes developed for other proteases such as caspases or cathepsins [ 69 , 70 ] , the next generation of probes for DUBs will certainly be agents that enable direct visualization and quantifi cation of DUB activity in vivo. Such noninvasive agents have great potential for early diagnosis as well as pharmacodynamic evaluation of DUB inhibition in preclinical as well as clinical settings. One attractive avenue to explore for the development of selective DUB activity probes is based on the design of copper-catalyzed click-labeled DUB inhibitors with quenchable or nonfl uorescent labels [ 94 ] . Click-labeled ABPs allows for selective labeling, visualization, and enrichment of active enzymes in a complex proteome. Another approach will likely be based on the generation of noninvasive substrate probes that do not bind covalently to the enzyme. The advantage of this approach is based on the theoretically higher signal that can be generated, in contrast to covalent activity probes which are limited by the stoichiometric labeling of the enzyme (the signal being proportional to the amount of enzyme in various tissues). So far a very limited number of reporter substrates are available, none being cell permeable, or suitable for in vivo applications. Again, noninvasive permeable substrates will likely be derived from selective inhibitors of individual DUBs or knowledge around selectively ubiquitylated sites on DUB substrates. Probably one of the most promising avenues for developing cell-and tissue-permeable selective ubiquitin ABPs for DUBs will rely on the modifi cation of selective small molecule inhibitors of DUBs . Similar approaches have already achieved some preliminary success for other enzymes of the UPS such as E1 enzymes [ 95 ] and proteasome probes [ 96 ] . The limiting step in developing such probes for DUBs is currently a lack of potent, specifi c and selective DUB inhibitors available, however, the community is successfully designing novel generations of selective DUB inhibitors.",

For example, fi ve papers have been published in the past 3 years describing di-ubiquitin ABPs, underscoring the importance of these tools for DUB research. The JAMM family remains diffi cult to target using ABPs due to the catalytic mechanism which does not involve a covalent DUBsubstrate intermediate. Hopefully new approaches and novel probe designs will yield better tools to investigate this class of metalloproteases. ABPs will ultimately shed light on the function and relevance of DUBs involved in various chain-specifi c ubiquitin signaling, and will continue to advance our knowledge of DUB regulation and function in a cellular context. Furthermore, ABPs will aid the development and characterization of DUB inhibitors , allowing the monitoring of target engagement as well as selectivity in vivo. Finally, while ubiquitin ABPs have not yet been as broadly used as one might expect to monitor DUBs in developmental or pathological evaluations, they can provide a unique dynamic assessment of the activity of DUBs, and will undoubtedly become a more familiar option for many researchers.",
