The fact that the technology exists for analyzing genetic material in exquisite detail and constructing DNA in virtually any desired form was the basis for promising rapid translation into clinical medicine and the final cure for genetically determined diseases; cystic fibrosis is the prime example of such a lung disease. The promise was not kept, at least not in a time frame which was expected. That result is neither because the rationale was faulty nor because the tools of molecular biology were wanting. The devil was and is in the details. How do you deliver DNA to the desired cell targets in amounts sufficient to accomplish the desired effect? Viral vectors have received the most attention, but viral vectors have proven to have both theoretical and practical problems. In the lungs, these vectors have not fulfilled their original promise. Nonviral based strategies work in a general sense, but efficiency of gene delivery in vivo has been a limitation. In addition, the experimental end points in both clinical and preclinical investigation have been most often designed to demonstrate phenomenology rather than potential efficacy. And, why limit the potential of gene therapy to inherited disease? In fact, treatment of acquired diseases by increasing or decreasing expression of a given gene in the lungs that would hasten recovery from an acquired disease might be easier than treating inherited disease because the requirements for duration of transgene expression would be less stringent. Over the past two decades, we have learned enough about the pathogenesis of acute lung injury to predict that increased (or decreased) production of certain biologically active mediators should be beneficial. Genes encoding some of these mediators have been cloned and constructs made which express the genes. It is now possible using either viral or non-viral strategies to deliver expression constructs to the lungs and, since acute lung injury has a dismal prognosis and no effective drugs have been identified, this seems a good clinical target for gene therapy. In preclinical studies, we have shown that increased expression of the gene encoding the constitutive form of the cyclooxygenase gene (COX-1) results in increased production of prostacyclin and PGE 2 by the lungs and inhibits endotoxin induced pulmonary hypertension and edema. Additional studies demonstrate that increased expression of the alpha-1 antitrypsin gene in human respiratory epithelium in culture and in vivo has anti-viral and anti-inflammatory effects that are not predicted by extracellular concentrations of the transgene product. Thus, acute lung injury is a reasonable target for gene therapy, and evidence to date indicates that current technology is sufficiently robust to pursue this novel area for treatment of this devastating disease.",

One way the body protects itself against toxins is by increasing expression of genes encoding protective proteins.

Suppose it were possible to deliver a gene for one of these proteins to the appropriate site but over-express the gene by driving it with a strong promoter. That would increase local production of the protein and provide site specific protection from a potentially disease-producing invader. The concept is gene therapy for acquired disease.

We S 121 Fig. 1 Schematic illustration of the concepts underlying the first generation gene therapy. The concept has been mainly envisioned as a treatment of diseases which are the consequence of inheriting a defect in a single gene Fig. 2 Schematic illustration of the concepts which will determine future generations of gene therapy. Nucleic acid binding proteins (gene regulating proteins; transcription factors) can be delivered to the nucleus to regulate endogenous genes. Alternatively, the genes encoding the gene regulating proteins could be used as a molecular pro-drug delivered a plasmid containing a gene encoding the constitutive form of the COX gene (COX-1) to lung vascular endothelium by infusing intravenously the plasmid DNA complexed to cationic liposomes [8] . We had shown earlier that this approach delivers the gene mostly to the lungs and mostly to lung vascular endothelium [9] . When rabbits were transfected this way, we found that after 48 h, the lungs made increased amounts of prostacyclin and PGE 2 compared to lungs from animals which were transfected in an identical way with an empty plasmid (Fig. 3) [8] . As shown in Fig. 4 , we also found that the pulmonary vascular response to endotoxin was inhibited. As has been shown with exogenous infusion of PGE 2 , transfection with the COX gene inhibited the endotoxin induced release of thromboxane from the lungs (Fig. 5) . We are now con-ducting additional studies to see whether the gene can be delivered by small particle aerosols and whether the biochemical and pathophysiological effects will be similar to those resulting from intravenous delivery.

The first gene therapeutic agent shown to be safe and efficacious for treatment of a lung disease is not far away and once that occurs, the floodgate will be opened and the era of gene therapeutics will be finally underway.
