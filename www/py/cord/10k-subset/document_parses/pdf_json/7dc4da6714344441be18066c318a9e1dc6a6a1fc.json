The ICU and non-ICU pilot trial patients were both infected with a diverse range of Gram negative and Gram positive bacterial pathogens, and each included patients with a diverse range of host comorbidities. Typically a trial based on a specific diagnosis (e.g., pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction) would be conducted across the full spectrum of severity, including those patients admitted to ICU and non-ICU wards. Conceptually, enrolling both non-ICU and ICU patients captures the full spectrum of bacteremic illness, and the patients are only dichotomized by the location of care within the hospital. The 90-day mortality rate in this pilot RCT (12.8%) was similar to the mortality rate seen in a recently published RCT of 604 patients allocated to 7 versus 14 days of antibiotics for patients with Gram negative bacteremia conducted on non-ICU wards in three centers in Israel and Italy [12] . As expected, the 90-day mortality rate was lower than that seen in our prior BALANCE-ICU pilot RCT (15%) [9] . The mortality difference between non-ICU and ICU patients is even wider than the ICU pilot data suggest, because a more updated mortality estimate from the BALANCE main trial suggests that the mortality has risen to 17.3%. At a fixed non-inferiority margin of 4%, adding non-ICU ward patients in the study would decrease our total sample size requirement (Fig. 3) ; maintaining our sample size target would enable us to reduce the achievable absolute non-inferiority margin (Fig. 4) . It is important to note that our 4% non-inferiority margin is already much smaller than the noninferiority margins used in recent trials of antibiotic treatment duration in patients with serious bacterial infections [12] [13] [14] [15] , and is also much lower than the US Federal Drug Administration recommendation of noninferiority margins for ventilator-associated pneumonia [16] . Therefore, we have opted to maintain our current overall sample size target (n = 3626) for the BALANCE main trial.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1917, "end": 1921, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2029, "end": 2032, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2736, "end": 2740, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2741, "end": 2745, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2746, "end": 2750, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2751, "end": 2755, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2898, "end": 2902, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2390, "end": 2398, "text": "(Fig. 3)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2509, "end": 2517, "text": "(Fig. 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our BALANCE-Ward pilot RCT enrolled patients in six sites, and so we cannot be certain that the recruitment and adherence results would be generalizable to all of the sites involved in the BALANCE main RCT. However, the generalizability is bolstered by inclusion of a mix of both community and academic hospitals, as well as sites with long-standing versus recent involvement in the CCCTG. Another limitation is that we cannot predict whether expansion to include non-ICU enrolment will lead to a compensatory decrease in ICU recruitments by diluting study teams' efforts across broader clinical units. In our six pilot RCT sites, though, we did not see reductions in ICU recruitments. As BALANCE is expanded hospital-wide, we will assess the interplay of ICU and non-ICU recruitment rates over time. The low rate of enrolment of eligible ward patients, and wide variation across sites, suggests that further efforts may be necessary to foster enrolments, including educating ward clinicians about the pre-RCT work which has documented practice heterogeneity and collective clinical equipoise. The BALANCE-Ward pilot RCT experience suggests that sites with infectious diseases engagement on the study team achieve much higher recruitment rates and percent enrolment of eligible patients, and so this will be crucial for future sites considering hospitalwide recruitment. We will also need to track eligible non-enrolled patients, along with recruitment rates and protocol adherence, as a site-specific metric throughout the conduct of the trial.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The BALANCE steering committee and CCCTG have guided us in conducting step-wise pilots of the BAL-ANCE RCT protocol in the initial ICU population, and now in this non-ICU population, once again confirming the feasibility of the BALANCE trial design on general hospital wards. We have carefully reviewed the onegroup findings (maintaining allocation concealment) with the CCCTG and the BALANCE international steering committee, both of which have strongly endorsed the option for participating BALANCE sites to extend enrolments hospital-wide. Given the success of this non-ICU pilot, no other protocol changes are required to facilitate inclusion of non-ICU patients in the BALANCE main trial. A detailed statistical analysis plan involving the entire cohort will be published before the trial is completed; randomization will be stratified by ICU and non-ICU ward location, and a subgroup analysis will be conducted. The subgroup analyses, by definition, will not be powered to achieve the same non-inferiority margin as the overall BALANCE trial population. However, the achievable non-inferiority margins within the ICU and non-ICU subgroups will still be less than the noninferiority margins used in recent landmark antimicrobial minimization studies involving patients with serious bacterial infections [4, [13] [14] [15] . We anticipate that the final BALANCE trial results will be more generalizable to the full population of patients admitted to hospital with bloodstream infections, and yet will include a majority of critically ill patients, ensuring that the data are relevant to our sickest of patients. In doing so, we hope that BALANCE will provide an evidence foundation for the treatment of a broad range of patients with non-S. aureus bacteremia, and allow us to maximize the benefits while minimizing the harms of antimicrobial treatments for bloodstream infections.
