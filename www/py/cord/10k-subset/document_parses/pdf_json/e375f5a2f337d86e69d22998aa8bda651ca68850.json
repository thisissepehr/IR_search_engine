Despite the fact that bats carry and shed highly pathogenic viruses including Ebola, Nipah and SARS, they rarely display clinical symptoms of infection. Host factors influencing viral replication are poorly understood in bats and are likely to include both pre-and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.

Of the microRNAs identified, more than 100 are unique amongst vertebrates, including a subset containing mutations in critical seed regions. Clusters of rapidly-evolving microRNAs were identified, as well as microRNAs predicted to target genes involved in antiviral immunity, the DNA damage response, apoptosis and autophagy. Closer inspection of the predicted targets for several highly supported novel miRNA candidates suggests putative roles in host-virus interaction. Conclusions: MicroRNAs are likely to play major roles in regulating virus-host interaction in bats, via dampening of inflammatory responses (limiting the effects of immunopathology), and directly limiting the extent of viral replication, either through restricting the availability of essential factors or by controlling apoptosis. Characterisation of the bat microRNA repertoire is an essential step towards understanding transcriptional regulation during viral infection, and will assist in the identification of mechanisms that enable bats to act as natural virus reservoirs.

Another recent paper detected 887 mature and star miRNAs corresponding to 568 precursors in the mouse transcriptome, however this was achieved using almost 90 million Illumina reads [25] , more than 20x the data volume used in the present study. From these comparisons it can be concluded that the number of miRNAs observed in the bat transcriptome can be considered fairly typical. For 196 of the 399 bat miRNAs, reads corresponding to both mature and star sequences were detected, further increasing the likelihood that these miRNAs result from specific miRNA biogenesis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 557, "end": 561, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 642, "end": 646, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 869, "end": 873, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1058, "end": 1062, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "There is, as yet, no universally accepted procedure for identifying novel miRNAs in high-throughput sequencing data. In our study, the major factor determining the final number of miRNAs was the miRDeep2 score. As may be expected, lowering the cut-off score involves a trade-off between sensitivity (fewer false negatives) and specificity (more false positives). A cut-off score \u2265 1 provides a typical starting point for miRNA identification; however many highly-conserved miRNAs which are very likely to be real do not meet this stringent cut-off. If the cut-off score is lowered, however, the number of highly improbable candidates rapidly increases. Relying on a single, stringent cut-off point comes at a significant cost of missing many genuine miRNAs. We concluded that within our data, miRDeep2 score and read depth were the factors that best enabled miRNA identification. We chose a model that accepted all hits to known miRNAs (regardless of score), novel hits with scores \u2265 1 and read depth \u2265 2 (typical hits), and novel hits with scores \u2265 \u22125 and read depth \u2265 5 (outliers). Following the initial screening, a further 27 candidates were culled because they overlapped higher-scoring candidates, leaving a total of 399 candidates under consideration. This model, in our opinion, reflected a better balance between sensitivity and specificity than a single parameter cut-off model. In support of our decision, we found that 48 out of the 96 miRNAs that scored less than 1 returned good BLAST hits to known vertebrate miRNAs in miRBase. The remaining 48 could not be specifically identified, but included 8 in clusters and 13 that had BLAST hits to mature miRNAs in other bats. Our further effort to prioritise novel miRNA candidates based on the combined evidence provides additional guidance to assist with selecting candidates for further study. One miRNA (pal-can-276) featured noticeably in the analysis. Representing a homolog of miR-541, this P. alecto miRNA contained three unique changes in the mature sequence relative to other vertebrates, including two changes within the critical seed region. Amongst its predicted gene targets was ZFAT, a zinc-finger protein with roles in cell survival and apoptosis (particularly in immunerelated cells) [26] , and the TNF-receptor TNFRSF1B. In the rat, miR-541 is described as a brain-specific miRNA involved in neuron proliferation and neurite outgrowth via suppression of synapsin I [27] , while the corresponding star sequence (which is also unique to P. alecto including one difference in the seed region), has been reported to be downregulated in a region of the brain (the spinal dorsal horn) in rats with experimentally-induced neuropathic pain [28] . It is well established that miRNAs play important roles in apoptosis [29] [30] [31] , and one possibility is that viruses such as HeV block apoptosis via induction of host miRNAs that downregulate pro-apoptotic genes. P. alecto miR-541 is a candidate miRNA in such a scenario, however it remains to be experimentally determined as to whether the differences in the sequence of P. alecto miR-541 correspond to differences in function between bats and other mammals, or whether it plays any role in apoptosis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2259, "end": 2263, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2441, "end": 2445, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2708, "end": 2712, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2784, "end": 2788, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2789, "end": 2793, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2794, "end": 2798, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Four other miRNAs, representing homologs of miR-337, miR-377, miR-513c and miR-885 respectively, were also confirmed to have novel seed sequences in P. alecto.

Within the 100% match category, miRNAs were allowed to have up to 3 bp over/underhanging at the ends (a maximum of 2 bp was allowed for each individual end), relative to their top BLAST hit. This step that we refer to as 'end-anchoring' was accomplished using the custom BLAST output format and the command-line tool awk, and was deemed necessary to account for minor length variations in mature forms, but to screen out hits in which the alignment is merely truncated due to terminal mismatches. For identification of precursor miRNAs, the same parameters were used, except the minimum e_value was set to 0.001 and hits were filtered for > 80% identity and > 80% overlap using awk. Top hits were identified by e-value from the BLAST output using in-house python scripts.
