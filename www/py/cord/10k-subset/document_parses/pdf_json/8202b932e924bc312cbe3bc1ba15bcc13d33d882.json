            "text": "These studies were designed to further elucidate the relative contributions of transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms involved in 0-casein gene regulation in the mammary epithelial cell line designated COMMA-D and a clonal subline designated HC-11. Primary transcripts were mapped under various hormonal and substratum conditions using the technique of nuclear run-on transcription and single stranded sense and antisense probes spanning the 0-casein gene. In the presence of insulin alone very little sense transcription is detectable, but antisense transcription is observed, which originates at least 150 basepairs upstream of the normal start site of transcription and is present regardless of hormonal, cell substratum, cell type, or gene activity. Antisense transcription is also detectable in the 3' end of the gene. Insulin, glucocorticoids, and PRL are all necessary for a maximal increase in transcription. A 2-to 4-fold increase in transcriptional activity is observed in the presence of insulin and PRL compared to insulin alone, and this is accompanied by a 125-fold increase in the level of 0-casein mRNA. All three hormones act synergistically to induce a 10-fold increase in transcriptional activity, but the transcriptional increase across the gene is not equimolar. The 5' half of the gene is transcribed at a level that is 2-to 10-fold lower than that of the 3' half of the gene. These studies reveal a significant transcriptional component to 0-casein gene regulation which was not heretofore detected using double stranded cDNA probes representative of only the 3' half of the gene.",

To initiate these experiments the mouse /3-casein gene was first cloned and characterized, and various repeat-free subclones were generated to use in run-on transcription experiments. Run-on transcription assays essentially measure the density of RNA polymerases present in chromatin at a specific time, and thus, this assay can be used to assess whether there is equimolar transcription in a gene under various conditions. This technique is capable of mapping transcripts that are unstable and difficult to detect in steady state RNA. The use of single stranded probes with this assay has provided information not only about antisense transcription occurring within genes, but also has revealed the mechanism of a block to transcriptional elongation in several genes (8) (9) (10) .",

Since available cell culture lines displaying hormonally regulated /3-casein gene expression are mouse derived, a mouse genomic library was screened using previously characterized rat /?-casein genomic probes, and several X-phage clones were isolated. One such clone could be digested with EcoRI to yield three fragments which were 1.55, 6.6, and 1.35 kilobases (kb) in length. These fragments were subcloned into plasmid vectors and restriction mapped, and portions of each were sequenced. The 6.6-kb fragment contained the majority of the gene, the 1.55-kb fragment consisted of 5' flanking DNA, and the 1.35-kb contained the 3' end of the gene. Since the 6.6-kb fragment encompassed most of the gene it was further subcloned and sequenced in more detail. All of the exon/intron boundaries were located, and approximately 400 basepairs (bp) of 5' flanking DNA were also sequenced. The sequence derived from this clone as well as the 5' flanking region is in agreement with that reported by Yoshimura and Oka (11) .

A small increase (1-to 3-fold) is apparent in the presence of IM (Fig. 2B ). This transcriptional increase is at most 3-fold if compared using the B or C probe and considerably less when comparing the signals obtained with the A and D probes. This increase in the relative rate of transcription can be contrasted with the changes in the steady state level of j8-casein mRNA determined in parallel under these hormonal conditions (Fig. 2C ). In the presence of IM there is minimally a 125-fold induction of /3-casein mRNA compared to I alone (assuming the basal level to be 1). Thus, the increase in transcription from I to IM is too small to account for the increase in steady state /3-casein RNA levels. M might, however, have induced an early and transient increase in transcription, which disappears by 48 h, at which time the levels of steady state mRNA and transcription were assayed. This possibility was tested by performing a kinetic experiment in which run-on transcription assays were conducted 1, 4, 8, and 24 h after M addition. No early effect on transcription was found (data not shown). Thus, based upon these results the role of M in the presence of I appears to be predominantly posttranscriptional.",

Addition of cycloheximide for 5 h to COMMA-D cells after 48 h in the presence of IMF had little effect on /3-casein mRNA levels. However, if cells were incubated with IM for either 24 or 48 h or IMF for 24 h cycloheximide treatment led to a dramatic reduction in the level of /3-casein mRNA (27) . Additionally, either cycloheximide or puromycin treatment has been shown to block the hormonally induced increase in /3-casein transcripts in mouse mammary explants (35) . Therefore, it was of interest to know if this decrease was in part due to a transcriptional effect. To determine whether there were any labile factors that were necessary for transcription of the gene, cells were exposed to cycloheximide for 5 h after 48 h of pretreatment with IMF. Labile transcription factors or posttranscriptional modifications of these factors whose presence depends on ongoing protein synthesis should be sensitive to cycloheximide treatment. As shown in Fig. 3 treatment with cycloheximide significantly reduces (by >95% in the B and C clones) the level of sense transcription across the gene. The pattern of transcription after cycloheximide treatment resembles that found in the presence of I alone. Interestingly, the level of antisense transcription detected with the A and D probes is unaffected by this inhibitor. Therefore, some transcription factor (or factors) is either induced by I, M, or F, or a posttranscriptional modification of this factor(s) is dependent upon ongoing protein synthesis. were performed to assess whether antisense transcription played any role in the regulation of /3-casein gene sense transcription. In cases where antisense transcripts have been shown to be involved in gene regulation, their role has usually been inhibitory (14) (15) (16) . However, it is difficult to envision a negative role in this case because the level of antisense transcription is the same regardless of the activity of the gene in the COMMA-D cells (Fig. 2B) . A high level of antisense transcription was also observed in cell types that do not express /3-casein (Fig. 4) . C127 cells are a mammary cell line that does not express /3-casein, but exhibits a comparable level of antisense transcription. COMMA-D cells also produce barely detectable levels of /3-casein mRNA when grown on plastic at low density regardless of the presence of lactogenic hormones, yet a level of 5' antisense transcription similar to that detected previously is observed (Fig. 4) . Antisense transcription was also detected in NIH 3T3 cells, a fibroblast cell line (data not shown). Thus, the 5' antisense transcription is observed using nuclear run-on assays regardless of the hormonal or substratum condition and regardless of cell type. Interestingly, in COMMA-D cells grown at low density on plastic no signal was detected, either sense or antisense, from the D clone. Thus, it is possible that 3' antisense transcription is somehow related to cellsubstratum interactions.",

Accordingly, there would not be a significant change in the intensity of this signal under the different hormonal conditions studied in COMMA-D cells. To examine this possibility a clonal cell line, designated HC-11, derived from the COMMA-D cells was employed (17) .

In contrast, the HC-11 cells display no cell substratum dependence of /3-casein gene expression, and approximately twice the level of /3-casein mRNA is detected compared to that in the COMMA-D cells.

These subclones were used in run-on transcription experiments to map the precise location of the 5' antisense transcription. As illustrated in Fig. 6A , antisense transcription is confined to the 5' flanking DNA and originates at least 150 bp up-stream of the normal start site of transcription.

Therefore, if the introns were being spliced out and turned over during the 20min period of the run-on transcription assay, this could account for the lower signal observed from the 5' half of the gene. To test this possibility intron-and exonspecific probes were generated. If splicing and selective turnover were occurring, then the intron probe should give a markedly reduced signal, whereas the exon probe would be expected to yield an enhanced signal. If selective RNA turnover was not occurring, then the signals should be equivalent when expressed as parts per million/kb. The results from such a nuclear run-on experiment performed in HC-11 cells are shown in Fig.  7A . The HC-11 cells were employed in this experiment rather than COMMA-D cells, because they displayed even a larger gradient of nonequimolar transcription across the gene (Fig. 5C ). Intron and exon probes, designated C-i and C-e, respectively, were generated from the C clone. As shown in Fig. 7A , the signal from the intron probe is quite strong. Furthermore, when the results are quantitated as summarized in Fig. 7B , it is apparent that the signals from the exon and intron probes are equivalent.

Antisense transcription as well as some sense transcription is detected in the D clone, which most likely accounts for the signal obtained from the cDNA in the presence of insulin alone. This previously led to the underestimation of the extent of the transcriptional component of /3casein gene regulation. However, the remainder of the gene exhibits essentially no sense transcription in the presence of insulin alone. Therefore, these experiments indicate that lactogenic hormones exert a profound effect on /3-casein gene transcription.",

The role of M in /3-casein gene regulation is both transcriptional and posttranscriptional. The addition of M to cells in the presence of insulin leads to only a 2to 4-fold increase in transcription, while there is approximately a 125-fold increase in the steady state level of mRNA (Fig. 2, B and C) . Based upon the analysis of casein-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) constructs transfected into HC-11 cells, Doppler et al. (21) conclude that M action is primarily transcriptional. However, upon addition of M alone these investigators also reported only a 4-fold induction of CAT activity over the basal level obtained in the absence of hormones. This increase is similar to the transcriptional increase detected using nuclear run-on experiments upon the addition of M to cultures containing insulin alone. What was not analyzed in these experiments was the hormonal induction of /3-casein mRNA levels in HC-11 cells in parallel experiments. Even so, it would probably be invalid to compare the level of CAT enzyme activity and steady state CAT RNA with that of /3-casein RNA. Thus, any posttranscriptional component cannot be analyzed by this means.",

This is in contrast to our results in COMMA-D cells, in which there is a strict insulin requirement for /3-casein gene transcription (Fig. 2, A and B) . This discrepancy may be explained by the presence of trace amounts of insulin present in the serum used in the casein-CAT transfection experiments in HC-11 cells or the failure of this cell variant to require insulin for /3-casein gene expression. Previous studies in rat mammary gland explant cultures have demonstrated that insulin is essential for /3-casein gene transcription and does not affect the stabilization of the casein mRNA (18) .

For F to have an effect on transcription or steady state RNA accumulation it is necessary to include both I and M. This is unlike the combination of I and M, which results in a small but significant elevation in transcription, and a larger induction of /3-casein mRNA levels.

This result suggests the presence of at least one, if not more, labile transcription factor or a posttranslational modification activity sensitive to the inhibition of protein synthesis, which is specific for sense transcription. Antisense transcription is not affected under these conditions. Run-on transcription experiments and pulse labeling in intact cells demonstrated antisense transcription at both the 5' and 3' ends of the gene. Antisense transcription has been found in other genes (15, 22) and may be found to be quite common if experiments are designed appropriately to detect it. When antisense RNA has been shown to have a role in gene regulation it is usually an inhibitory effect (15) . The 5' antisense observed in the /3-casein gene is invariant with respect to any hormonal or substratum condition tested and is present in cells that do not express /3-casein. Both the 5' and 3' antisense transcriptions are due to RNA polymerase II activity. The 5' antisense transcription is confined to the 5' flanking region of the gene, and the promoter, therefore, appears bidirectional. However, Northern analysis so far has failed to detect any stable transcript resulting from either 5' or 3' antisense transcription (Goodman, H. S., and J. M. Rosen, unpublished observation). The 3' antisense transcription must occur within the gene, since the D clone contains the last intron and a portion of the last exon. If this antisense transcription is in any way regulatory, then the mechanism of regulation must be of an inherently different nature than those described previously (14, 15) in which antisense transcripts are readily detectable in steady state RNA. It is unlikely that the antisense transcription detected arises from an unrelated gene that shares homology with the /3-casein gene, because all of the probes used in these assays produce a single band upon Southern analysis of genomic DNA, suggesting that they represent a single copy gene. Also, the runon transcription protocol includes a RNAse treatment step such that if the antisense signals were from another gene, the sequences would have to be rigorously basepaired to withstand this part of the procedure.",

One notable exception is the accumulation of RNA polymerase II near the termination site well downstream from the site of polyadenylation, which is thought to account for an increased signal in nuclear run-on experiments using the ADA gene (25) . In the studies reported in HC-11 cells a similar distribution of RNA polymerase II molecules is observed in the intact cells using [ 3 H]uridine pulse experiments as in the nuclear run-on assays. Additionally, similar results have been obtained in nuclear run-on transcription assays performed in mouse primary epithelial cells cultured on an EHS matrix (Bissel, M., personal communication). One explanation for the nonequimolar distribution of transcription is that pausing of RNA polymerase II is occurring somewhere within the 3' half of the gene or between the 5' and 3' halves of the gene. This has been shown to be a means of regulation in a variety of genes, but in most cases pausing usually occurs very near the start site of transcription or within the first intron (8, 23, 24, (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) . To test this idea a series of run-on transcription experiments were performed in the presence of sarkosyl, which if used in the proper concentration will strip loosely associated proteins from chromatin (data not shown). Presumably, this might release a block to RNA polymerase II elongation, and equimolar transcription would then be observed across the gene. This was not observed, however, suggesting that pausing may not account for the nonequimolar transcription observed. Additionally, if pausing were occurring, one would expect at some point in time after hormonal addition to have observed increased transcription of the 5' half of the gene. Various kinetic experiments have failed to detect this transcriptional increase.",

This could be due to a different chromatin conformation in this region. It is possible that some elongation factor is necessary to efficiently transcribe the 5' half of the gene that is not present in these cells, perhaps because of the culture conditions employed. One possibility is that a cell-substratum component is missing in these cells which is necessary for the induction of this putative elongation factor. In E. coli, elongation of transcription is a common mechanism of gene regulation, an example being the nusA elongation factor.

We have found that it is critical to use single stranded probes that span the gene in this analysis. Antisense transcription may not be a rare occurrence in genes, and the only way to assess its contribution in run-on transcription assays is to use single stranded probes. Additionally, Zilz et al. (31) have reported differences in results of experiments designed to assess the effects of thyroid hormone depending whether single or double stranded probes were used in run-on transcription experiments, although this was not apparently due to antisense transcription. The fact that the entire gene may not be transcribed at the same rate also illustrates the importance of using probes that correspond to different areas of the gene.",

The long half-life of casein mRNA appears to contribute to the absolute level of mRNA accumulation and protein synthesized to a greater extent than the absolute rate of transcription. The transcription rate for 0-casein even in the fully induced state is not appreciable. For example, it is not as high as that observed for the rate of histone H4 gene transcription, and yet casein mRNA levels are at least an order of magnitude greater than histone H4 levels in the mammary cells. The casein gene produces a very stable transcript in the presence of the proper hormonal and cell substratum conditions, with a half-life of more than 24 h. Studies are in progress to try to identify regions of the mRNA that may confer its intrinsic stability and may possibly play a role in the regulation of casein gene expression. grown essentially as described previously (1, 9) . COMMA-D cells of passage 10 or less were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with glutamine (Sigma), 5% fetal calf serum (Hazleton), 5 Mg/ml I (Sigma), and 50 Mg/ml gentamycin sulfate (Sigma). HC-11 cells were grown in RPMI medium (Hazleton) with 1 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Sigma) included as well. Before hormone treatment cells were incubated in medium containing stripped horse serum in order to avoid exposure to any lactogenic hormones present in normal serum. Lactogenic hormones were then added [I (5 Mg/ml), hydrocortisone (1 Mg/ml; Sigma), and ovine M (1 Mg/ml; NIH)] for various times. When cells were grown in the absence of I, 0.5% BSA was added as a substitute. I withdrawal has been performed in this manner and when added back to cells in the presence of hydrocortisone and M, the ^-casein gene shows the normal induction (Poyet, P., unpublished observations). In experiments using cycloheximide, cells were treated with hormones for 48 h and then incubated for an additional 5 h with cycloheximide (10 (12).",

Positives from the initial screen rescreened in secondary and tertiary screens until they were purified.

Cells were grown in the presence of IMF on either plastic (PI) or floating collagen (FC). Both HC-11 and COMMA-D cells were grown at high density (confluence) for several days before hormone addition. After 48 h of hormone treatment with IMF total RNA was isolated and quantitated by slot blot analysis. B depicts the transcriptional analysis of ^-casein gene expression in the HC-11 cells. HC-11 cells were grown on plastic at confluence for 4 days in the presence of I and stripped horse serum and then in the presence of IMF for 48 h, as described in Materials and Methods. Nuclei were isolated and used in run-on transcription assays as previously described. C shows the quantitaion of the sense transcription from the experiment in B. Values are normalized with respect to vector background signal, clone size, number of input counts, and hybridization efficiency.",
