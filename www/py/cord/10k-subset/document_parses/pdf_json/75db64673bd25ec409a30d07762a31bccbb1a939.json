Anew antigenic shift of influenza A virus may occur in the near future. Influenza B virus also exhibits antigenic drift sequentially every few years. Over time, prophylaxis for both influenza A and B viruses becomes ineffective using current vaccines. In May 1997, a 3-year-old boy in Hong Kong died of respiratory failure caused by an influenza virus infection; an influenza A strain ofH5N1 subtype was isolated from a sample of the bronchial aspirate. Between November 1997 and January 1998, 17 patients infected with the H5Nl subtype of the virus were detected, of whom 5 died. The influenza A H5Nl strain was isolated from chickens in several poultry farms and 1.5 million chickens were sacrificed in order to prevent an epidemic of the new antigenic virus among the human population.

They are classified based on the cluster shape and category and the number of nuclear metal ions. Polyoxometalates inhibit oxidation and reduction reactions in vitro and inhibit the replication ofHIY, herpes simplex virus, RS virus and influenza viruses in tissue cultures. The antiviral activity of polyoxometalates against influenza virus and RS virus was shown to be highly dependent on the type of cluster and nuclear metal ions. [24, 25] We tissue culture system. Atitanium-containing Keggintype polyoxotungstate (designated as PM-523) emerged as the most potent and selective antimyxovirus compound.P'l PM-523 and ribavirin mixtures showed a synergistic effect at ratios of 1 : 4 to 1 : 64. [27] The combination index was calculated by the formula from Chou [28] and was less than 0.6 (> 1.0 is estimated as antagonistic, 1.0 as additive, <1.0 as synergistic) [ fig. 3 ]. PM-523 was investigated for its anti-influenza A virus activity following administration as an aerosol to mice infected with a lethal dose of the virus (PR8/HlNl). Following exposure to PM-523 4.8 mmol/L for 2 hours twice daily for 4 days, 50% of the infected mice survived, whereas all the infected and untreated mice died by day 9. When we used a mixture ofPM-523 and ribavirinat a ratio of! : 16 (PM-523 2.4 mmol/L and ribavirin 40 nnnol/L) to treat the infected mice, a synergistic and improved therapeutic effect was achieved compared with the individual use of either compound; 80% of the mice survived to day 9 with the combined use of these compounds, in contrast to all the mice dying by day 9 with use of the individual compounds.F'l We demonstrated that PM-523 inhibited fusion between the influenza A virus envelope and the cellular membrane, whereas it did not inhibit the adsorption of the virus onto the cell membrane.l-sl Thus, the mechanism of anti-influenza virus activity is quite different from that of ribavirin and zanamivir, which inhibit RNA replication and the NA activity of the influenza virus, respectively. PM-523 and zanamivir also showed a synergistic inhibitory effect against influenza virus in vitro; the synergism was more prominent against influenza B virus than against the A virus (Mori S et al. In order to analyse the antifusionactivity ofPM-523 for the influenza virus, strains of influenza virus A resistant to PM-523 were isolated after sequential passages of the wild strain of AJIshikawa/ H3N2 in PM-523-containing cultures of MDCK cells. The resistant strains were analysed for amino Table III . Antimyxovirus activities of several polyoxotungstates l26] Shigeta acid substitutions of HA after cDNA amplification of the HA genome. All 5 strains which were resistant to PM-523 possessed mutations in HAl at positions Lysl89 and Ile204 compared with the sequence of the wild-type (sensitive) strain. These point mutations were located in the globular head of HAl and the interface edges of the trimer molecules. The trimers open their heads in response to the conformational change ofHA at low pH. Thus, we assumed thatPM-523 binds to the interface edges ofHA trimers and inhibits the opening of HAl trimers, consequently inhibiting fusion of the viral envelope to the cellular membrane by HA2 hydrophobic amino acids at the edge of the cleavage site (unpublished observations) [ fig. 4 ].",

The synergistic anti-influenza virus activity of this compound with ribavirin or zamamivir offers promise for the use of PM-523 as a therapeutic drug for influenza virus infection. In addition, PM-523 and its congeners have broad antiviral activities against enveloped RNA viruses and may be developed as broad -spectrum drugs for ARI caused by ortho-and paramyxoviruses. Among the patients who were febrile and began treatment within 30 hours after the onset of symptoms, alleviation of the major symptoms occurred at least 2 days earlier in the treated group compared with the placebo group) 31] A randomised double-blind clinical trial of zanamivir for the treatment of influenza A and B infec-tions was carried out by the Management ofInfluenza in the Southern Hemisphere Trialists (MIST) study group during the winter season of 1997/1998)32] 321 patients were randomly assigned to inhaled zanamivir lOmg or placebo twice daily for 5 days. Zanamivir significantly shortened the time to alleviation of symptoms compared with placebo (5.0 vs 6.5 days; p = 0.004). Patients who were febrile (temperature >37.8\u00b0C) and virologically positive for the influenza virus responded (alleviation of clinical symptoms) 2.0 days earlier in the zanamivir group than in the placebo group. High-risk patients (those with respiratory, endocrine, metabolic or cardiovascular disorders, immunocompromised patients or patients aged 65 years or older) responded a median of 2.5 days earlier when treated with zanamivir than when treated with placebo. The most common adverse effects observed with zanamivir inhalation were respiratory effects (bronchitis and cough). However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse effects between the zanamivir inhalation group and the placebo group. The study group stated that zanamivir was well tolerated among high-risk patients.Ivl Drug-resistant viruses were isolated by passaging the virus in MDCK cells in the presence ofzanamivir. Mutations in HA and NA were found in the resistant virus. The HA mutation, 198Thr to Ile, reduced the affinity of the virus for the receptors found on susceptible human cells (Siaa2-6Gal). Weak affinity of HA for the receptor may facilitate the release of the virus from cells, and NAactivity may not contribute significantly to the release of the virus. Thus, zanamivir is thought to inefficiently inhibit the release of the resistant strains with mutations in HA. Two types of NA mutants were also isolated from the culture described above. One had a mutation in the catalytic site ofNA (Arg292 to Lys) and the other a mutation in the framework residue ofNA (Glu119 to Gly, Asp or Ala) with which the guanidino group of zanamivir interacts.U'l",
