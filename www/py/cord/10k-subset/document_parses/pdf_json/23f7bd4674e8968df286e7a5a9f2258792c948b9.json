Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne disease caused by the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), which causes high levels of mortality and morbidity in domesticated animals and mild to serious disease in humans. Since the virus was first described in Kenya in 1931 (Daubney et al., 1931) , no extensive human outbreaks of this disease were reported until 1951, when approximately 20, 000 individuals were infected in South Africa (Mundel and Gear, 1951) . Subsequently, there have been several RVF outbreaks with significant impact on human health in eastern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula (Meegan, 1979; CDC, 1998; Shoemaker et al., 2002; Woods et al., 2002) (http://www.who.int/csr/ don/2007_05_09/en/). At present, RVFV is present or endemic in al-most all African nations, as well as Saudi Arabia and Yemen in the Arabian Peninsula (Figure 1 ), and has the potential to expand to other regions.",

In addition, wildlife and livestock may play an important role in outbreaks in humans. Human cases are primarily caused by bites from infected mosquitoes or by direct contact with tissues or fluids from infected animals (Anyangu et al., 2010; Baba et al., 2016) ; In addition, vertical transmission has also been reported in mosquito vectors, ruminants, and humans (Arishi et al., 2006; Adam and karsany, 2008) . In humans, the disease can present with fever, headache, arthralgia and muscle pain, acute hepatitis, or hemorrhagic and neurological manifestations, and the fatality rate can reach 50% in patients with hemorrhagic complications (Swanepoel et al., 1979; Madani et al., 2003) .

However, the symptoms persisted, and he arrived in Beijing Capital International Airport in serious condition (http://www.who.int/ csr/don/02-august-2016-rift-valleyfever-china/en/). Two days later, the National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People's Republic of China reported this as the first imported case of Rift Valley fever in China (http://www.aqsiq. gov.cn/xxgk_13386/tsxx/yqts/20160 8/t20160803_471831.htm).",

The outbreak in Saudi Arabia and Yemen in 2000 was caused by infected animals imported from Kenya (Baba et al., 2016) . Confronted with this imported case, the government in China has implemented surveillance, monitoring, and other measures to prevent the spread of RVF in China (http://www. nhfpc.gov.cn/yjb/s3578/201607/e1fc 91f93d034bd0b952b8745356bd65.s html). However, because conditions for the spread of RVF are currently present in China, there is a risk that RVF may spread from this imported case. Firstly, mosquitoes, the RVF vector, are very active in summer, and Aedes mosquitoes are widely distributed in China, especially Southern China. Secondly, there have been several rounds of heavy rainfall since June, and many provinces have experienced flooding. Based on the lessons learned during the outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and given these conditions, there is a high risk that the imported case may spread or even cause an outbreak, if proper measures to prevent and control RVF are not implemented.",

Enhanced surveillance and monitoring of the numbers and infection level of the vector are also important. In addition, infection of livestock is a risk factor, because humans can be infected by direct contact with infected animals (Anyangu et al., 2010) and mosquitoes can spread RVFV via infected animals. It is therefore advisable to suspend trading of livestock with countries experiencing an RVF epidemic and to implement a strong quarantine. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of strengthening collaboration and coordination across sectors, such as government, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, researchers, and hospitals, to make prevention and control measures more efficient, was demonstrated when the MERS case was imported in China (Su et al., 2015; Su et al., 2016b) and during the RVF outbreak in Saudi Arabia (Himeidan et al., 2014) . Development of an effective vaccine for prevention of RVF is urgent for both humans and animals.",

More importantly, once RVFV is introduced into permissive ecologies, it can become endemic, with the potential to spread into other non-endemic regions (Murithi et al., 2011) . If there is an RVF outbreak in China, the disease may spread quickly to Southeast Asia and to other countries in Asia. Combined with the import of the Zika and yellow fever viruses this year (Su et al., 2016a; , importation of arboviral pathogens poses a huge challenge for China.
