A bilateral pneumothorax observed under CMV resolved during HFOV and no new air-leak occurred but the number of infants is too small to draw conclusions. Hemodynamically, a few infants did require adrenergic support but renal function was well preserved as suggested by the physiological metabolic compensation of the respiratory acidosis that occurred over time.

Such settings seem at first poorly adapted to the ventilation of obstructive lung disease. However, with HFOV, the transmission of pressures and volumes delivered by the ventilator is exquisitely sensitive to the mechanical properties of the respiratory system and the endotracheal tube [19] . Thus, the requirement of high peak to peak pressure can be explained by the dampening that occur through the small endotracheal tube and down the highly resistive airway of these infants, reducing pressure swings and effective tidal volume [19, 20] .

More importantly, this high mean aw pressure is considered necessary to generate a sufficient pressure to open and stent the collapsed small airway, allowing pressure swings to be transmitted peripherally and alveolar ventilation to resume in obstructed lung units. In this concept termed the ''open airway'' concept, mean aw pressure becomes a major determinant of CO 2 elimination [9, 10, 13, 14] .
