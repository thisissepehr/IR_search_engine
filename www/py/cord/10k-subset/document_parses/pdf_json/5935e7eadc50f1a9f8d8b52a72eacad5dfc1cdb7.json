The SDBD operated at atmospheric pressure in humid ambient air (25 \u00b0C, 40% RH). The driving AC-voltage (8.6 kV pp (peak-to-peak), see Fig. 1 ) was a burst of two AC cycles (f AC = 5 kHz) with a repetition rate of 500 Hz (duty cycle of 0.2) ensuring a homogenous distribution of microdischarges. The real discharge 'ON' period is actually shorter compared with the AC cycle period, we can estimate an effective duty cycle of the order of 0.1 of the nominal one 53 . This guarantees that the biological samples were not exposed to excessive noxious temperatures. The average power was 6.5 W, with an energy density of 1.5 10 \u22122 Wh L \u22121 . The air SDBD worked in the ozone mode, concentration typically 200-300 ppm, exceeded significantly nitrogen oxide product concentration, typically 30-40 ppm of NO 2 and 2-3 ppm of N 2 O 13, 53 . Figure 2 shows low resolution emission spectra of filamentary SDBD driven in humid air revealing strong bands of the second positive system (SPS) (C 3 \u03a0 u \u2192 B 3 \u03a0 g ) of N 2 and first negative system (FNS) (B 2 \u03a3 u + \u2192 X 2 \u03a3 g + ) of N 2 + in the UV spectral range. In the Vis-NIR range, we observed characteristic sequences of bands of the first positive system (FPS) (B 3 \u03a0 g \u2192 A 3 \u03a3 u + ) of N 2 . Atomic oxygen emission line was clearly observable at 777 nm, indicating the production of atomic oxygen during the plasma on phase. Partially-resolved structures of SPS displayed in Fig. 3 were analysed by means of synthetic models detailed in 61 . The SPS(0,0) band can be fitted for a given instrumental function by fixing the rotational temperature of 400 \u00b1 25 K. We should notice that this temperature is related to the discharge on time in the surface discharge. SDBD plasma is localized just a few microns above the dielectric surface and this cannot be considered the temperature of the gas in contact with the treated substrate. Moreover, considering that the gas is flowing at 7 slm, the residence time in the discharge volume is 64 ms, therefore we can exclude a heat accumulation inside the gap. In Fig. 3 experimental SPS(0,0) band profile is shown together with two synthetic profiles (simulated for rotational temperatures of 300 and 500 K) in logarithmic scale in order to demonstrate sensitivity of the tail of the band (formed by the overlap of R 1 , R 2 and R 3 branches) with respect to the rotational temperature of the C 3 \u03a0 u state. Figure 4a captures the emission formed by \u0394v = \u22123 and \u22122 sequences of the SPS and by \u0394v = 0 sequence of the FNS.

The evolution of damages on conidia surface spanned from cracks to complete removal of the outer layer of the cell wall, shrinkage, and a deeper ablation from the surface of conidia.

Therefore, SEM analysis demonstrated modifications of the external shape of conidia, which could be attributed to the decomposition of organic components by etching and photo-desorption associated with chemical bond breakage, and consequent formation of volatile compounds 65 . www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ In addition to direct antimicrobial activity on fresh produce, LTP may also act indirectly by inducing plant defense responses 47 . The activated chemical species produced by LTP may contribute to both the suggested modes of action by acting rapidly against contaminant microorganisms and as a defense inducer in plants. ROS and RNS have a significant impact on plant cells causing many physiological, biochemical, molecular, and hormonal changes 89 . Treatments with plasma-activated water induce plant growth as well as endogenous production of ROS and RON, defense hormone metabolism, and up regulation of pathogenesis-related genes in tomato seedlings 90 , thus enhancing resistance against bacterial leaf spot 91 . Our results suggest modifications in fruit tissues which can suggest metabolic changes affecting infection establishment. A slight colorimetric change was observed on treated fruits suggesting an increase of contents in polyphenolic compounds after plasma treatment (data not shown).
