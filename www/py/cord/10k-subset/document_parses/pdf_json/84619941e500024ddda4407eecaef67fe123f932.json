            "text": "The design of the alveolar septum displays a number of features that favor the maintenance of a dry air-blood barrier in the interest of gas exchange. Whereas gas exchange occurs in relation to a 2-compartment model -alveolar air space and capillary blood space separated by the tissue barrier -the control of fluid movements is understood on the basis a 3-compartment model, with the cellular sheets of epithelium and endothelium separating three fluid spaces: plasma, interstitium, and alveolar lining layer. The capillary endothelial cell lining is continuous, but the intercellular junctions are leaky, allowing smaller solutes to be easily exchanged between plasma and interstitial fluid. In contrast, the alveolar epithelium is made of a mosaic of squamous type I cells and cuboidal type II cells; the epithelial intercellular junctions are tight, preventing simple solute exchange between interstitium and alveolar lining layer. In the interest of optimizing barrier structure for gas exchange the type I cells are of vast expanse, highly complex in their architecture. As a consequence they are very vulnerable and their repair upon damage is difficult. Regeneration of alveolar epithelium must occur from type II cells as stem cells. An important question is how the alveolar septum prevents fluid from accumulating in the tissue space. It appears that the compliance of the alveolar septal interstitium is restricted by design: (I) by eliminating an actual interstitial space on large parts of the surface due to fusion of epithelial and endothelial Oasement membranes; (2) by the myofibroblasts in the actual interstitial space. Moreover, any fluid accumulating in the septum is rapidly drained away towards the juxtaalveo]ar fluid sumps and lymphatics. Efficent gas exchange in the lung requires a short diffusion distance between alveolar air and capillary blood over a wide contact area. To this aim the tissue mass of lung parenchyma is extremely reduced: the capillary bed is covered by a thin tissue membrane and supported by a flimsy connective tissue network. Obviously, these delicate structures are easily deformable, and the dimensions of structural elements important for gas exchange, i.e. the alveolar surface area, the thickness of the blood-gas barrier, and the capillary volume are profoundly affected by the interaction of four mechanical forces: i) tissue forces; 2) the microvascular pressure; 3) the alveolar pressure; and 4) the surfaces forces. Within the lung volume range of normal breathing the surface forces have a strong impact on the free surface area, since alveolar walls appear to be negligible mechanical components except as platforms for surface tension. Compared with fluid filled lungs normal air filled lungs reveal a reduced free alveolar surface area by folding of the alveolar septa beneath the surface lining layer. Abnormally increased surface forces further reduce the surface area. The peripheral airspaces become unusually wide, and are separated by bulky tissue masses of piled-up septa of \"collapsed\" alveoli. Among other features these structurefunction relations may explain impaired gas diffusion, increased right-to-left shunts, and increased alveolar dead spaces in lung diseases affecting the properties of alveolar surface lining layers only. The acute stage of ARDS is characterized by an interstitial and alveolar edema due to focal alveolo-capillary barrier destruction regardless of whether the primary action site of the noxious stimulus may have been alveolar space or capillary lumen. While epithelial lesions can easily be visualized endothelial defects are sparse although occasional large amounts of red blood cells and fibrin strands in the subendo\" thelial and interstitial space are strong evidence of temporary capillary leaks. Different cell repair mechanisms, a fast one for the endothelium and a time consuming two stage repair process for the type I epithelial cells, account for this observation. The thickening of alveolar septa by proliferation of type II epithelial cells and an accumulation of cells and fibers in the interstitial space, intraalveolar fibrosis, changes in extraalveolar vessels and structural rearrangements of peripheral air spaces are distinctive features of the subaeute stage of the disease. Its duration does not necessarily correlate with the severity of structural alterations. Cases of severe functional impairment may go along with extremely reduced capillary volumes and a very low oxygen diffusion capacity as estimated by morphometry. Rapid improvement of gas exchanging and ventilatory lung function may reflect a partial restoration of the geometry of peripheral airspaces rather than a reversion of fibrotic lesions. The pulmonary edema of the ARDS is due-to loss of integrity of pulmonary capillary walls. ARDS complicates pulmonary and systemic infections, hypoperfusion states, inhalation of toxic gases including oxygen, aspiration of damaging liquids, intravascular coagulation or embolism, platelet and leukocyte aggregation, immunopathies and allergic reactions, and hypoxia, all of which may lead directly or indirectly to endothelial cell damage. Many humoral factors are involved (in vitro and in vivo animal studies, very few human studies) : activated complement fractions, prostanoids, leukotrienes, proteases, peptides and coagulation and fibrinolysis products. We have studied complement activation, thromboxane and prostacycline metabolites (TX% and 6-oxo-PGF I ), and immunoreactive and enzymatlcally active thypsin in plasma from 50 ARDS patients. Abnormal C~ consumption (as measured by C3a/C ~ ratio) and elevated plasma Cm -like activity ~as~measured by a leukocyte a~regation assay) were associated with, respectively, 84 % and 86 % of cases of ARDS. Both tests were more sensitive indicators of complement consumption than assays of total hemolytic complement activity (CH50) or total C 3. Sequential samples on both sides of the pulmonary circulation showed initial pulmonary clearance followed by liberation of C~ -like activity. Abnormal TXBe plasmatic values were ~und in 58 % of ARDS patients, during consecutive days of evolution; values up to 8000 pg/ml were measured. Trypsin values were enhanced (> 70 ng/ml) in 87 % of ARDS patients, particularly in septic cases; repetitive high trypsine values correlated with high mortality rate. Our data confirm the participation of the complement-leukocyte cascade in the increased pulmonary capillary permeability of ARDS. Selective sequestration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) in the lung seems to play a central role in early ARDS. Sequestered PMNs m~y damage lung tissue either directly or by releasing mediators such as lysosomal proteases (f.e. elastase). We studied the possible role of PMNs and of elastase on lung function by infusing elastase in normal and in agranulocytic minipigs. METHODS: Among 16 minipigs studied (anaesthetized and ventilated) 4 were pretreated with dimethylmyleran which depleted granulocytes ccmioletely. 3 pigs without pretreatment or elastase infusion for control. Elastase was infused (330 U/kg-h) continously for 3-4 hours in the elastase and in the agranulocytic group. ~itiple determinations of cardio-respiratory functions were repeated in short intervalls before and during the treatment. Finally, morphological studies were performed. RESULTS: The control group revealed steady state conditions during the whole experiment. However, elastase caused typical effects beth in the normal as well as in the agranulocytic pigs: I/anediately after onset of elastase pulm.art.pressure (PAP) increased but only temporarily. Oxygenation (AaD02) deteriorated after one hour when PAP again had returned to baseline. Pulm. diffusing capacity decreased slightly. In the non-pretreated pigs elastase infusion caused a significant sequestration of PFi~s in the lung. But, as the effects on lung function were nearly identical in the normal as well as in the agranulocytic group, this could primarily be an elastase effect independent of the presence of PMNs in the lung. CONCLUSION: Elastase, released by PMNs sequestered in the lung, may (interacting with other systems?) play a role in early ARDS. Elastase itself seems to induce pulmonary P~ sequestration by neurophil activation.",

Morphologically 2 distinct stages are present, the \"lung in shock\" within the first hour and the \"shock lung syndrome\" which manifest itself after 24 to 48 h. The early stage \"lung in shock\" is characterized by a multitude of changes in the microvascular system: massive leukostasis, polymorphonuclear granulocyte (PMN) degranulation, and endothelial cell swelling. The purpose of the study was to compare the ultrastructural findings of the lung, liver and skeletal muscle with respect to the granulocytes (PMN) and the endothelial cell damage. In many phases, the endothelial cells are considerably swollen in the lung and skeletal muscle. But whereas many polymorphonuclear granulocytes present in the alveolar capillaries of the lung, only a few isolated granulocytes are seen in the vessels of the skeletal muscle tissue. Leucostasis in the lung was also confirmed quantitatively using llIIn-oxine labeled PMN; in the liver it was present to a much lesser extent, while there were no changes versus the pre-shock period in skeletal muscle. The granulocytes might be responsible for the onset of lung damage after shock, acting on the endothelial cells (reactive oxygen species).

The cyclic changes in heart performance during artificial ventilation have to be ascribed to mechanisms with short time constants because they occur and recover within the period of a ventilatory cycle. Therefore, nervous and humoral control as well as cardiac contractility changes are rejected as mechanisms explaining the cyclic events. Guyton's theory, that venous return (Qv) is controlled by central venous pressure (Pcv), also counts for the cyclic events during artificial ventilation. Pcv is mainly dependent on intrathoracic pressure (Pth), although a decrease of Pcv,tm (transmural) occurs during insufflation: the decrease in venous return due to the increase in Pcv causes a decrease in filling pressure i.e. preload. Also transmural pulmonary artery pressure (Ppa,tm) decreases during insufflation when PEEP is below about 6 cmH20. This fall in afterload might contribute to the decrease in RV-filling pressure. Above a PEEP of 6 cmH20, Ppa,tm at peak insufflation increases progressively, when PEEP increases, undoubtedly due to a progressive obstruction of the pulmonary circulation. The fall in venous return to the left ventricle (LV) can be ascribed to the fall in RV-output. The time delay can be explained by a squeezing effect on the pulmonary circulation during early insufflation. Plved,tm fell during late insufflation and early expiration concomitantly with the fall in pulmonary venous return. This fall also caused a fall in transmural aortic pressure. Cardiac compression and ventricular interdependence were rejected as mechanisms controlling heart action during artificial ventilation.",

RV volumes (EDV-ESV) were calculated by both thermodilution and radionuclide studies at O, 15, 20, 25 Conclusions : In ARDS pts, PEEP decreases RVSV by imposed limitation on EDV (due to increased intrathoracic pressure) despite a higher after load.

The high sensitivity of this method is its major advantage, since the use of highly, insoluble gas (SF6, ethane) can detect zones with VA/Q ratios of lower than 0,01. The infusion of the most soluble gas (acetone, ether) provides a measurement of dead space. Additionally, this method is not dependent on Fi% and oxygen diffusion.

So far, this method has been mainly directed at evaluating the effect of mechanical ventilation, with and without PEEP, anesthesia, decubitus, pulmonary edema, ARDS.

The method offers a sophisticated aooroach for understanding the complex VA/Q relationshi.o in lung disease.

Indications for HFV are based upon our clinical experiences in 137 patients: 1.Postoperative ventilation in cardiac patients (n=45). Gasexchange could be maintained well during controlled ventilation and the weaning period. Conteraction to hemodynamics depends on f,I/E-ratio and primary pressure. 2.Intraoperative application of HFV (lung surgery) (n=36) is favourable (extensive resting position of the lungs, reduced gas loss through pleural leakage).3.Intensive care patients(n=56). In ARDS better PaD 2 in comparison to conventional ventilation could be established in using high frequencies( 5Hz) long I/E ratio and high primary pressure. Bronchopleural fistulae were managed with FDV(Iow VT) , the combination with IPPV faciliated CO 2 elzmination. In normal lung function low frequencies (I,5-5Hz) short I/Eratio and low primary pressure (1,5-2 bar) achieved satisfactory gas exchange with low Pairway\" In patients with brain damage we observed a arop in intracranial pressure.

Hedenstierna, Dept. of Clinical Physiology, Huddinge Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden Anaesthesia and acute respiratory failure impede vnetila-Lion of dependent luna units and perfusion of non-dependent ones, creating considerable ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch. General PEEP can improve V/Q but it cannot restore it to normal. To imarove matching, ventilation must be distributed in proportion to regional blood flow. This can be accomplished by I) placing the subject in the lateral position, 2) ventilating each lung in proportion to its blood flow (differential ventilation) and 3) applying PEEP solely to the dependent lung to ensure even distribution of inspired gas within that lung (selective PEEP). Differential ventilation with equal distribution of the tidal volume between the lun~d a selective PEEP of I0 cm H~O to the deoendent lung resulted in equal distribution o~ perfusion between the lunqs in ana~tized lung-healthy subjects, suggesting \"optimum\" ~/Q matching. Using this ventilator setting as a rule of thumb in patients with acute, severe, bilateral lung disease, arterial oxygen tension was impr~an average of 45% compared with that during general PEEP, with no reduction in cardiac output. It is concluded that differential ventilation with selective PEEP can offer considerable improvement in gas exchange in acute, bilateral lung disease.

A non-homogeneous state of excitability of the heart forms another condition indispensible for reentry because it enables unidirectional conduction to take place.

An exact knowledge of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of antiarrhytmic agents is essential for their optimum use in intensive care patients. The electrophysiological mechanisms of action, as well as possible effects on sinoatrial,atrioventricular or intraventricular conduction, myocardial contractility and peripheral resistance should be taken into account when a particular drug is selected to treat acute ventricular or supraventricular arrhytmias.A further decisive factor for therapeutic success is the choice of an adequate dosage regimen Potentially effective drugs may fail because the therapeutic serum drug levels are not reached and/or maintained during a dosage interval.Drug elimination rate in acutely ill patients is often altered by cardiac,hepatic and renal failure or by interacting drugs administered simultaneously. Individualization of antiarrhytmic drug dosage is therefore necessary to obtain maximum benefit and to avoid unwanted side-effects. This task can be facilitated by serum drug concentration monitoring. Rapid and reliable techniques for measuring lidocaine, procainamide, quinidine and disopyramide concentrations are now available. The practicability and utility of this approach will be illustrated by data on lidocaine treatment in patients with ventricular arrhythmias following myocardial infarction.",

In patients with acute coronary heart disease the value of antiarrhythmic treatment of the so-called \"warning '! ventricular ectopic beats to prevent ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation is still questionable. As long as such arrhythmias are treated routinely in most coronary care units, worldwide, the reliable detection of ectopic beats is essential. The conservative methods of continuous ECG observation on a scope of up to eight patients at a time is no longer a justifiable task for well trained and highly skilled CCU personnel, for two reasons: l) Even persons specialized in rhythm recognition miss up to 60% of ectopic beats during more or less continuous observation of an ECG display screen. 2)ECG reading is a typical taskforthecomputer. An investigation of the specificity and sensitivity of our arrhythmia-monitoring system (EP 78220) still revealed a considerable number of false-positive alarms, disturbing the nursing staff unnecessarily, but ahighsensitivityofmore than 90% in the detection of ectopic beats (n=10.400) represents an increased level of security for the patients. Histographical presentation of the trend of the arrhythmias facilitates the overview, while TV display in all rooms of the CCU and the proven reliability of the system give the nursing staff more freedom in patient care. Our nurses would now certainly not like to have to live without the system. Many antiarrhythmic drugs have been studied on their efficacy in preventing primary ventricular fibrillation in acute myocardial infarction, but only lidocaine given in rather high dosages has been shown to be effective in one randomized controlled study. In view of the rather high incidence of side effects this latter study and the equal mortality rates in both groups, prophylactic antiarrhythmic treatment in all patients admitted to the CCU because of acute myocardial infarction is questionnable. However, recent uncontrolled observations on lidocaine have indicated a very low incidence of primary ventricular fibrillation and one case controlled study showed a lower hospital mortality in lidocaine treated patients. Moreover 20% of untreated patients will develop recurrent attacks of ventricular fibrillation which may lead to extension of infarction and higher mortality rates. Other studies have suggested that effective lidocaine prophylaxis during 48 hours can be achieved with an acceptable incidence of minor side effects and a low toxicity provided that the following measures are undertaken: I. adequate loading dosages of 200 mg given in 10-20 minutes, 2. continuous administration using automatic infusion pumps in dosages averaging 3 mg/minute, 3. carefull monitoring of side effects and abrupt discontinuing when they supervene, 4. reducing dosages by at least 50% in shock, heart failure or hepatocellular disease. It may be concluded that prophylactic antiarrhythmic treatment with lidocaine is preferable than placebo, provided that adequate measures are undertaken. MASSIVE PULMONARY EMBOLISM : DIAGNOSTIC ASPECTS. P.Even, D.Safran, G.Dennewald, M.Stern, P.Reynaud, H.Sors.H~pital Laennec, 75007 Paris, France. 500 patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) were studied by heart catheterization, perfusion lung scan (PS) and angi~ graphy (PA) and some by ventilation scan (VS) or digitalized substraction angiography ; 40% had massive PE (> 60% vascular obstruction-Miller index). In spite of new soph~ sticated investigation methods the initial diagnosis remained desperately erratic and delayed (I-90 days) with an eqal number (60%) of false positives or false negatives eliciting dramatic consequences : recurrent PE and undue and hazardous anticoagulation or surgery. The main erro~were : a) in non-massive PE, acute or chronic lung diseases (pneumonias, atelectasis, cancer, asthma, pleurisy) b) in massive PE, heart, abdominal, septic or nervous diseases (myocardial infarction, cardiac tamponade, dissecting aneurysm, hypovolaemic or septic shocks, acute peritonitis, liver or sub-phrenic abcesses, acute cholecystitis or pancreatitis, stroke). To improve the diagnosis performance we have reexamined the sensitivity and specificity of clinical and laboratory findings rather their frequency order. We propose the following statements : I) always think to PE but never accept it without proof, 2) there is no benign PE but only benign first PE, 3) there is no unic massive and lethal PE but only multirecurrent PE, 4) a suspected PE has to be urgently proved or disproved and energically treated whatever its importance, 5) the decreasing order of specifity is : PA (to affirm) = PS (to eliminate) > Chest X-ray >> phlebitis, associated symptoms (pain + dyspnea + hemoptysis), etiology, EKG, hemodynamics, >> isolated sympto~ , blood gas, enzymes, lung scan (to affirm): 6) VS gives rarely more information than PS, 7) recurrency has to be proved by PA and not by PS, 8) PA has to be performed as freque~ tly as possible to establish the diagnosis, specify the site and size of the clots and control the venous iliocaval axis. Fibrinolysis is not indicated in minor embolism where there is no haemodynamic disturbance and is ineffective in chronic thromboembolism. Its use is limited to acute massive embolism (with or without shock) when it is the treatment of choice. In such patients accelerated resolution has been demonstrated (as compared with anticoagulant therapy) in a number of studies.",

Massive pulmonary embolism (MPE), obstructing more than 50% of the pulmonary circulation, leads to an increase in pulmonary artery (PA) resistance, PA pressure and right ventricular (RV) work. This will lead to acute RV failure (acute cor pulmonale) and decrease of pulmonary flow and cardiac output. Echocardiography has revealed several abnormalities in patients with MPE. I) Dilatation of the PA and right ventricle. The size of the PA appears to correlate well with the mean PA pressure. 2) Decrease of the left ventricular dimen~o~ Additional inspiratory decrease in left heart volume may lead to failure of aortic valve opening and therefore to paradoxical pulse. 3) Abnormally high ratio of right/left ventricular enddiastolic diameter. This index correlates well with the angiographic severity of the embolic obstruction in patients without prior cardio pulmonary disease. 4) Abnormal (paradoxical) diastolic motion of the intervenhricular septum. 5) Abnormal motion of mitral or tricuspid valve. Echocardiographic association of a large right ventricle, a small left ventricle and a paradoxical motion of the septum is very common in MPE and allows to explain the physical findings. Dyspnea, tachypnea and tachycardia are usually present in MPE. Other findings may indicate acute cor pulmonale: accentuation of the pulmonic closing sound, RV diastolic gallop, elevated jugular venous pressure with large A waves. These abnormal signs and symptoms Will progressively disappear with the spontaneous or therapeutical removal of pulmonary embolic obstruction. Dept.cf Thoracic Surgery, Karolinska hospital,Stockholm, Sweden. Chronic pulmonary embolism with pulmonary hypertension and cot pulmcnale can,after intense functional and anatomic investigation,be treated succesfully with TEA of the pulmonary artery. Perfusion scintigram is for screening a simple and informative procedure.Pulmonary angiogram is accurate for anatomical localisation,and angiogram of the bronchial arteries important to assure a ~ell functioning periferal circulation of the pulmonary vessels. Heart catheterization is necessary to evaluate the degree of pulmonary hypertension,which is the most important prognostic variable for succesful surgery, the better prognosis the lower pressure. The cases of three young women with chronic pulmonary embolism with systolic pulmonary pressure of three different levels about 25,80 and125 mm Hg respectively were all operated with TEA at clinic of Thoracic surgery,Karolinska hospital,Stockholm,with results corresponding to preoperative pulmonary pressure. The importance of early diagnosis before severe pulmonary hypertension has developed is stressed and the value of adequate diagnostic methods is illustrated. Operation is to be done with cardio-pulmonary by pass stand by. With proper investigation and treatment in cooperation with surgeons,cardiologists,physiologists and radiologists the prognosis f~ chronic ~ulmonary embolism with pulmonary hypertension and cot pulmonale encouraging for many patients,where although optimal pharmacological treatment,pr0gressive heart and pulmonary incompetence develops. The universally accepted classification of Dissecting Aortic Aneurysms defined by De Bakey et al (1965) will be described and two others mentioned. The role of diagnostic imaging methods, particularly radiology, ultrasound and computed tomography in determining the presence of a dissecting aneurysm of the aorta and in demonstrating its site and extent, including involvement of branches of the aorta, will be discussed and illustrated.

The Intensive Therapy Unit (ITU) in Oxford is classed as a general Unit for there is a separate Coronary Care Unit and paediatric ITU. The ITU is set up with 8 beds, 2 of which are high dependancy and medically the Unit is run by anaesthetists. There is a small commitment to cardio-thoracic surgery, otherwise general medicine,surgery, trauma and renal cases are admitted. To cover these 8beds there is a total of 47 trained nurses plus 2 Student nurses in basic training; for a period of 1 month, and post basic course nurses.These are people undertaking National recognised Courses in various specialities; Intensive Care, Accident and Emergency Nursing and Anaesthetic Nursing. There are 6 ITU Course members, of which we have a minimum of 2 and maximum of 6 at anyone time.The other 2 Courses never send more than 2 members each at anyone time. A part from these various other people from different areas come for a period of orientation ie Renal Course, theatre assistant trainees.Of the 47 permanent team, 6 are Sisters, 31 are Staff Nurses (3 yr.general training) and I0 Enrolled Nurses (2 yr.general training). The Unit is covered with two-eight hr. shifts overlapping during the day and an I1 89 hr night.There is a minimum of 8 nurses per shift plus basic and post basic learners.The average lenght of stay of staff is about 7 month,that means a continual recruitment programme, stepped up just before the Summer as this is when the main drop occurs 70% of the permanent team hold a nationally recognised ITU nursing certificate, the other 30% are made up of people with little or noexperience in this speciality, consequently the teaching input has to be high, and the overlap period in the afternoon is an ideal time to do lectures.Education of all staff not only Course members and learners, but experienced staff must be an ongoing process to train and maintain motivation.All staff, commen-cing employment undergo a 3 day general hospital orientation.Staff within the Unit then work with experienced members of staff for the first two weeks and have lectureson basic monitoring and ventilating equipment technique. Following this,those staff programme involving lectures and clinical teaching on basic ITU knowledge and skills ie Care of Ventilated patient, from both staff nurses and Sisters. Intravenous additives and arterial line assessments are taken by all staff before they are able to administer drugs or take blood specimens from arterial lines.Staff are predominantly trained by the bedside with one to one teaching which is ideal for gauging knowledge and adaptibility of the learner. Impromptu lectures are given by all staff including Doctors, depending on work load on the Unit.Available each day are lectures for staff to attend; general hospital sessions,lectures from all disciplines specifically for ITU nurses,XRay conferences; to short talks given by the staff nurses themselves.

            "text": "Intensive care was born frc~ several specialities, including internal medicine, anesthesiology, surgery and pediatrics. The will of these primary specialties to keep critically ill patients within their own deparhaent has impeded the development of multidisciplinary intensive care units. These specialities have also feared that recognition of intensive care medicine as a distinct entity would anloutate their own cfml0etence. Hcm~ver, a multidisciplinary approach to an unique \"intensive care\" improves both conprehension and management of critical states. The introduction of large autoncmous departments of intensive care has been facilitated by the construction of new hospitals. Nevertheless, critical should be better defined throughout the world. Responsabilities in intensive care, coronary care, neonatology and even emergency medicine can be very different not only from town to town but even scmetimes frcm hospital to hospital within the same to~n. In our 31-bed medico-surgical department, internists, anesthesiologists and surgeons who are in rotation represent 8 of the 16 manbers of the medical staff. They are eager to spend this training period and very concerned about Instruction in our discipline. Each patient has one \"intensivist\" directly responsible for his care, in good relationship with consultants and primary physician. Specialization in intensive care medicine is rendered essential by the coniolexlty of ccmlorehension and management of critical illnesses more than by purely technical aspects of their care. We suggest specialty in intensive care medicine to be recognized to those who have had a two year period of training in a deparlxnent of intensive care, after full training in one of the primary specialties. SHOULD INTENSIVE CARE MEDECINE BE AN INDEPENDENT SPECIALTY? J.P.Gardaz,P.M.Suter,Department d'Anesthi@siblogie,H6pital Cantonal Universitaire,GenOve. The structures of intensive care medecine(ICM)vary widely from country to country.ln France,Japan and South Africa, for example,there are university departmen~of critical care medecine headed by full professors in ICM.It has become a primary speciality of its own in Spain and Australia.The United States has opted for a subspecialty in critical care medicine rather than a primary discipline,whereas others countries like the United Kingdom,Switzerland do not recognize ICM officially. These differences encountrered in the academic and medical structures reveal the complexity of the problem. Intensive care medecine is a \"multidisciplinary\"endavour crossing traditional departmental an speciality lines and it is conceivable to create autonomous departments of multidisciplinary ICM runned by primary specialits in intensive therapy.Although we recognize that there is a need for special knowledge and skills on the part of those providing patient care in intensive care units,we do not support the specialty of\"intensivist\" as primary specialty for the following reasons:First ICM physicians should have a solid training in Internal Medicine and Anesthesia(or Pediatrics for pediatric ICM)before training and practicing ICM.Second, at the present time there is no specific training programme,no uniform career structure nor academic future ensured in the majority of countries of Western Europe. Furthermore intensive care medicine as primary specialty can be hazardous,because, outside intensive care units,there is no professional alternative for intensivists who whish or have to change their medical activity at a later time.This point is of particular importance because good ICM needs dynamism, fresh ideas and a great physical and psychological commitment, factors found usually in greater quantity in people at 30 than at 60 years of age. In Intensive Care Medicine (ICM), a rather young branch of medical sciences, almost day b~ day sets of problems are encountered, some of them \"shouting with urgency\" for rapid answers. Systematic research efforts in this field, however, are not yet taken for granted. A cumulative survey for 198o/$2 comparing 3 leading anaesthesiological (A: Anesthesiology, BJA, Anaesthesist) with the same number of Intensive Care periodicals (I: Critical Care Medicine, Intensive Care Medicine, Intensivmedizin) revealed a striking difference in research activities: 64.9% of papers in (A) vs. only 31.4% in (1) were devoted to scientific investigations (studies related to morbidity, epidemiology, assessment of economic and personnel requirements not being taken into consideration). In our own institution 56.8% of ICM-papers referred to research programs. -Besides that a wide scatter in intensity of interest is to be seen: Subjects like cardiovascular and/or pulmonary pathophysiology etc. covering 45% of all publications are opposed to poorly if not insufficiently (<1%) treated topics like e.g. renal function or immunology. -In order to enhance interest and to overcome the abovementioned gaps being eventually also detrimental to ICUpatients organisational (access to experimental departments, research programs (i), and computing facilities; provision of biomedical and laboratory technicians working IN the ICU etc.) as well as other motivating measures (editorial policy of journals, improvement in career structures etc.) should be promoted. Much of our current knowledge and clinical practice in Intensive Care is based on animal experiments and conventional medical principles and may not be relevant to treating critically ill patients. As an Intensive Care specialist, I have tried to document the three most common important problems I face each day; on the basis that this is where our research should have priority. My first is getting enough money to run the ICU, and being able to justify to my colleagues and the community that my treatment makes a difference and that the difference is worthwhile. Because this is one of the hardest areas to define and from which to gather meaningful results, it does not mean that we should not collectively attempt it. It is imPortant now and crucial for the future. My second problem is how to assess, treat and predict outcome after cerebral damage -from whatever cause. I often feel I am working without hard facts or guidelines, and too often with\"personal experience\" and instincts. The third major problem I have in clinical practice, and not necessarily the least important, is how to prevent or treat septicaemia. I feel current recipes temPorarily improve the \"numbers\" but do not substantially affect outcome.",

Multidisciplinary approach to intensive care and collaboration with specialists in basic research should be encouraged to improve the quality of the investigation. Systematic collection of datais essential to yield comprehensive clinical studies. Some forms of treatment, such as fluid challenge or PEEP administration, should be standardized. In our department, a minimum daily set of laboratory data is defined, including arterial lactate concentration, colloid osmotic pressure and urine osmolarity. A simple, mobile cart has been designed to perform routine hemodynamic studies at intervals in patients with invasive monitoring. Clinical practice raises questions that need an experimental support to be answered. Clinical investigation in the intensive care unit should be closely linked to an animal laboratory. Difficulties in the development of reproducible experimental models of acute organ failure should be challenging rather than dissuasive. We have set up a dog laboratory for hemodynamic studies of acute states, for which fonding has been essentially supplied by external support, in a spirit of positive collaboration between the private industry and the university. (RNV] are increasingly used to evaluate patients (pts) with acute myocardial infarctdoe (ANI). These techniques are non invasive and may be applied to critically ill pts at the bedside without appreciable extra risk or discomfort. Approximately 80 percent of the pts with transmural or nontransmural AMI can be detected by Tc-PYP if the imaging is performed 24 to 72 hrs aTter the onset of the symptoms. Tc-PYP has been utilized in localizing the site and deter mining the extent of AMI. The \"doughnut\" pattern is associated with a large incidence of subsequent congestive heart failure and death. T1-201 performed within 24 hours of AMI has been useful for recognizing, localizing and roughly sizing areas of infarction and surrounding ischemia, The extent of TI-201 defect in an initial image may have important value, For separating high-risk and low-risk subgroups of hemodynamically stable pts with AMI.

K.Thurau, Department of Physiology, University of Munich, Munich, FRG In order to reprocess the chemic'al composition of body fluids, the kidneys deliver a large volume of filtrate from plasma to the tubular epithelium, which then forms the final urine by selective reabsorption of filtered water and substances and the secretion of substances from the blood into the urine. Both processes, filtration and reahsorption/secretion, are powered by different energy sources, filtration by myocardial metabolism and reabsorption by tubular cellular metabolism. Normally, the large reabsorptive capacity of the tubules allows the kidney to deliver 100-150 ml fihrate/min to the tubules which have inherent discriminatory activities in the selection of filtered constituents for reabsorption or excretion. This high turn-over of extracellular fluid serves the important function in the kidney of continuously reprocessing the plasma. It contains an inherent danger -that of severe fluid loss if the tubular reabsorptive mechanism should fail due to nephrotoxins or renal hypoxia. There is evidence that the primary site of action of nephrotoxins and hypoxia is located in the tubular cells. The pathobiochemistry of the kidney in acute failure includes defects in the membrane-bound properties for fluid reabsorption, such as changes in permeability and active salt transports. These initial cellular defects may produce secondary phenomena such as activation of the tubulo-glomerular feedback, the intrarenal renin angiotensin system, a fall in GFR, tubular occlusion, vascular constriction etc. The foremost \"secondary phenomenon\" appears to depend critically on the type of renal insult, its severity and time course.",

The causes of acute renal failure (ARE) have to be early recognized in order to put the patients into one of the 3 following categories : prerenal, renal or postrensl. The two first situations could be separeted on the basis of several urinary indices among which the most efficient is the fractional sodium excretion (FeNs). This parameter classifies correctly 99 % of the patients. FeNa allowed, in our personal series, an early diagnosis of prerenai or renal ARF in 50 patients at the time where serum creatinine was rising from 120 + 30 to 250 + 50 umol/1. Limitations to this index concern mostly patients with nonoliguric ARF associated with salt retaining states. Some of these patients could be considered as prerenal while they are actually renal. In these peculiar setting, measurements of enzymuria could provide an accurate diagnosis.Radiologieal investigations have to be done in all patients in whom an obstruction of the upper urinary tract is suspected or could not be ruled out. Nowadays, the method of choice to demonstrate pyelocaliceal dilatation is sonographic examination. Its specificity and sensitivity is very high. Rare false positive results are due to a very recent obstruction or to large calculi whereas false positive are due to prior dilatations or to constitutive large cavities without obstruction:at the time of ARF. In cases of dilatation, sonography must be completed by intravenous (antero or retrograde) ureteropyelography to determine the nature and the location of the obstruction. Conclusions. Use of FeNs and sonography provides an early diagnosis of the causes of ARF and permits the choice of the appropriate therapy which prevents a further degradation of renal function and may change the outcome of the patients. Exceptional causes of ARF such as acute glomerulonsphritis or vascular obstruction need a different approach based on clinical ground. Therapeutic modalities in acute renal failure J.P. Wauters, Division of Nephrology, University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland. The classical treatment of acute renal failure (ARF) i.e. peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis once uremic symptoms appear, has now been largely replaced by a more aggressive and individualized therapeutic approach.The importance of an adequate caloric and protein intake has been better understood. At least 35 Kcal/kg and 0.5 gr/kg of protein should be given daily. Therefore the management of fluid and electrolyte balance is not always possible by conservative means. It is presently admitted that once oliguric ARF is established there is no further reason for diuretic or mannitol administration. Among the substitutive therapies, peritoneal dialysis became easier through the experience gained with the CAPD technique. Hemodialysis can now be performed with the use of bicarbonate in dialysate,sequential ultrafiltration and/or volumetricaly monitored ultrafiltration during dialysis. Other substitutive therapies have been proposed : I) hemofiltration can be usefull when cardio-vascular instability precludes the use of conventional dialysis; 2) plasmapheresis by centrifugation or filtration techniques has been recommended when ARF is due to acute intoxications by poisons which are largely bound to proteins; 3) spontaneous femoral arterio-venous hemofiltration appears as an easily applicable bedside technique allowing to overcome simultaneously the fluid balance and uremic problems, without the continuous need for dialysis equipment and staff. Despite those advances, the complication rate during ARF remains high and is still responsible for the persistently high mortality.",

In 1969, Gersony, Duc and Sinclair reported the fatal out come of two term neonates who had severe hypoxemia within the first 24 hours of life. Carefull investigations and post-mortem examination had failed to demonstrate any underlying abnormalities. In order to explain these observations, the authors suggested that a suprasystemic pulmonary vascular resistance may have create a right to left shunt through the foramen ovale and/or the ductus arterio sus and therefore decreased dramatically the pulmonary perfusion. This hypothesis was thereafter applied to various situations of neonatal cardiopulmonary distress with severe hypoxemia and where no cardiac defect could be detected. Different conditions have been demonstrated to participate in increasing the pulmonary vascular resis tance I. increased blood viscosity 2. inadequate development of the pulmonary vascular bed 3. pulmonary vasoconstriction and 4. extrinsic or intrinsic pulmonary vascular obstruction. At birth, the term neonate has functionnally closed fetal shunts ; he also has very reactive and mu$culated pulmonary vessels. This makes him particularly prone to develop persistent fetal circulation, even more so as pulmonary vascular smooth muscle can be further hypertrophied by chronic hypoxemla or premature ductal closure during fetal life. In assessing the neonates who pre sent severe hypoxemia resistant to optimal oxygen therapy~ echocardiography seems to be the most appropriate procedure. It helps i. to rule out a structural cardiac defect 2. to objectivate concomitant cardiac dysfnnction and 3. to document pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary hypoperfusion and/or right to left shunt. Therapy should first try to suppress any factors favoring pulmonary vasoconstric~ tion. If inefficient it may be completed by the earefull use of vasodilator drugs and/or respiratory alkalosis.",

We studied 115 animals between 125 and 134 days gestation (tern 147-150 days) to determine the optimal pulmonary nanagement for RDS prevention. In 70 cases we performed a cesarean section, exposed the head of the fetus, and intubated the trachea, leaving the fetus still connected to the nether through the intact umbilical cord and placenta. The lungs were inflated to a pressure of 35 cm H 0 for 5 2 secs for 3 times; we then measured the total compliance injecting known quantity of gas in the lungs and recording the resulting pressure. Thereafter 32 animals were immediately delivered and treated with state oF the art ventilatory care, while 38 underwent apneic oxygenation while still on placenta, until total conpllance -i-i exceeded 0.5 ml (cm M20) kg .

Some good experiences with lower temperatures for tcPcO2-measurements have been reported (i) which allow for a long-time monitoring without the risk of skin burns 6 We have examined how different tesperatures (41 and 44 C) influence the calibration stability, the repreductibility, the response time and the correlation to the Pco 2 in blood samples. The measurements were carried out on premature infants in serve-controlled incubators. We used two industrial prototypes (Draeger and Radic~eter) which were calibrated at 40 and at 80 Torr, fixed simultaneously on the thorax and conloared values with the Pco 2 in capillary or arterial blood sanloles. Except for the expected slower response t//ne there was no disadvantage at 41UC. With both temloeratures the tcPco 2 was largely increased for both prototypes ccnloared to the Pce2 in blood samples. There were strikingly large interi~dividual differences. This makes a general inset built compensation difficult. Since the introduction ofpositive pressure ventilation into clinical medicine, the parameters used in mechanical ventilation tended to mimic those seen in normal respiration. While in most instances this proves to be an effective method of managing respiratory failure, there are still many patients with severe parenchymal lung disease who have a hypoxemia, refractory to any manipulation of the respirator. (changing I:E ratio, wave forms, end expiratory pressure). With the introduction of HFV, a new era has opened up in ventilator management of patients with severe respiratory disease. High frequency positive pressure ventilation (HFPPV) includes all ventilators that can cycle at rates between 60 and 120 (facility available on some modern conventional mechanical ventilators). High frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) includes a group of ventilators that use a high pressure gas source ventilating at voltages at or below dead space at rates up to 5 HZ. High frequency oscillation (HFO) uses rates of 1-40 Hz. generated by high frequency sine wave. These technic have features and characteristics which are unique but the theory is essentially the same : patients may be ventilated at volumes substantially less than dead space, with lower mean airway pressures than seen with conventional ventilation. There are now nt~nerous studies in the literature to show that both HFJV and HFO are extremly efficient in terms of CO 2 elimination with low mean airway pressures. However, in order for this technique to make a transition fram a physiological curiosity to a therapeutic advance, it requires that it can be shown to iuprove patients with severe respiratory diseases (refractory hypoxemia secondary to either alveolar or interstitial lung disease). As oxygen transfer occurs during both inspiration and expiration, ,the major problem remains to open alveoli and keep them open throughout the respiratorycycle. HFV is an efficient way to achieving gas exchange in both normal and diseased lungs.",

There is no doubt that it is a major advance in the treating of brcncho-pleural fisulae, and in laryngeal and tracheal surgery where substantially lower moan airway pressures are of undoubted benefit. The proponents of HFV also advocate its use in thoracic and neurosurgical procedures where a motionless operating field would be of great assistance to the surgeon. Before widespread introduction into clinical practices, several major mechanical and safety features have to be ironed out. Htwnidification is a problem ~n to all types of high frequency ventilation. The ht~nidification systems currently in use are not entirely satisfactory, but there does not seem to have been a problem with mucociliary clearance in htmlan studies. The second major problem is that of patient safety. The very high gas flow used in both HFO and HFJV can lead to a rapid buildup of pressure within the lung if the gas outflow beeches obstructed. A rapidly responsive blc~off system needs to be incorporated to relieve the pressure within the system, if the gas exit beccn~s occluded. HFV stands on the verge of beccming a major advance in respiratory care. A well controlled study is urgently needed before it can be clearly demonstrated that it is superior to conventional ventilation in patients with severe lung disease. HFV will never replace conventional ventilation as the standard form of ventilator, but the day is probably not too far off when every ICU will have one or two high frequency ventilators to cope with patients With severe parenchymal lung disease. and must be well known by all physicians who care For neongtes. The clinical picture is usually a combination of strider, obstructive dyspnea, dysphonia, and swallowing disorders. But less typical features are possiblep such as apnea, cyanotic attaks, bradycardia or cardiac arrest. This presentation is a retrospective study on g80 new borns and infants with congenital laryngeal anomalies seen at our pediatric otolaryngology department from 6 Is, 1974 to 5 31th 1982. The diagnosis was : idiopathic congenital laryngeal strider (laryngom~lacia) in 348 cases (51 ~), 15 % of witch were severe, with respiratory distress and/or Feeding difficulties ; laryngeal paralysis in 161 cases (24 ~), among witch 56 were bilateral and 105 unilateral; laryngeal incoordination in 23 cases ; laryngeal stenosis in 79 cases (12 %), among witch there were 58 subglottic stenosis, 18 webs and 3 atresias ; subglottic hemangioma in 45 cases ; ary-epiglottic and hypoglossal cysts in 15 cases ; laryngo-esophageal cleft in 8 cases and bifid epiglottis in one case. For each o~e os these anomalies, clinical features, radiologic evaluation, endoscopic findings and treatment are reviewed. colonization with multiple organisms is frequent. 59 children incubated or tracheostomized, aged 1 day to lO years, and having X-ray evidence of pulmonary infiltrate were studied ~ith the technique of uncontaminated peripheral airway samples (UPAS) described by E.B. Matthew (Grit Csre Red 1977 ; 5 : 76 -81) . 41UPAS were performed,no complication was observed. 29 UPAS showed no growth though one pathogen was recovered from 17 trachea] samples. In 28 patients pulmonary course was fsvourable without antibiotic therapy. In i patient false negative UPAS was observed. In 12 UPAS pure culture of a single organism was obtained, in 8 cases th e psthogene recovered from tracheal samples was identiesl, in 2 cases it was different, in 2 cases tracheal samples were sterile. The organism's role in producinq pneumonia was confirmed by its isolation in 4 patients from blood or empyema fluid. UPAS in children is s single, safe and reliable technique. It shows that most pulmonary infiltrates in children with endstrseheal tubes have not a bacteriological etiology and do not need antibiotic therapy. Positive UPA5 gives s specific etiological diagnosis ; however its interpretation is more difficult when trseheal pathogen is identical. Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from december 1981 to march 1982 in 85 hospitalized children (2 weeks to 22 months old, 45 under 3 months) with lower respiratory illness to study respiratory syncytial (RS) virus antigen by an indirect immunofluorescence technic (IFI). Collected by_nasopharyngeal aspiration, the specimens were flushed with phosphate-buffered saline 1,5 ml, then centrifuged at 1500 rpm for ten minutes three times. The cellular pellet was used to prepare smears, which were air dried and fixed in acetone for ten minutes. The slides were stained with anti RS antibody (Wellcome), then with antiimmunoglobulin fluorescent conjugate (Wellcome). A slide was considered positive when several epithelial ceils showed a granulous cytoplasmic fluorescence. Result could be obtainable 6 to 12 hours later. Thirteen children with no respiratory illness were used as a control group ; all samples were negative. 37 of 59 samples of children with wheezing associated respiratory infection were positive . Among lO children with bronchitis without wheezing, 5 were also positive. Three children had evldenced apneas of whom two had positive specimens. Overall RS antigen was found in 44 out of 72 children (61%) suffering of lower respiratory illness. A correlation with levels of total and anti RS virus immunoglobulins present in serum and in secretions is under investigation. This study demonstrate that RS detection using IFI is a convenient rapid diagnostic test to precise the etiology of infant viral respiratory illness and to decrease antibiotics prescriptions. We have now extended this approach as a rapid diagnosis technic of RS and others potential viral agents of respiratory illness in children. The bacterial quantification is difficu!t in small samples. The comparison between cultural characters of tracheal secretions and pulmonary biopsy may be an reliable approach for the diagnosis of the pulmonary infection. This study included 22 neonates and infants who died from different diseases. They had been intubated few hours to 57 days. The tracheal secretions were collected for culture twice a week ; the last sample collected on the day of death. Pulmonary tissue specimens were obtained by needle puncture immediately after death. Pathology has been known for 19/22 cases. All positive cultures on the day of death were monobacterial. -12 pulmonary culture were negative ; among them, 7 patients had no bacteria in their tracheal secretions and one germ was found in 5 patients. In these 12 cases, no histologic sign of infection has been reported. -10 pulmonary culture were positive ; among them, in 7 cases the same bacte ria was found in tracheal secretions (with 5 times, histological signs of pulmonary infection] and in 3 cases a different germ was isolated. The bacteriological concordance between pulmonary tissue specimens and tracheal secretions was present 14 times. In 8 cases no concordance was observed. This study allows to conclude that : -absence of germ in tracheal secretions is a favorable factor, statistically likked with an absence of pulmonary infection ; -presence of germ should be followed by clinical, biological and radiological investigation looking for an pulmenary infection. Their absence with presence of a germ correspond to a colonlsation of the tracheal tube.",

There is growing evidence that the decrease in tissue sensitivity to insulin is due to a post-receptor block and this may be important both in deciding the fuel oxidized by these patients and for the abnormal protein metabolism wiaich is also present.",

The most important metabolic variations typical of a septic ill patient are as follow: glucid related metabolic perturbations, increase of body metabolism and rise of oxygen consumption, increase of protein catabolism and ureogenesis. These changes are the outcome of centrally controlled neuroendocrine incidents. They mobilize in fact an excess of endogenous substrates. These three kinds of disturbances escort in fact every trauma or important stress, but for the septic patient, they are characterized by their persistence and by the fact that unhappily most of the time, zhe evolution turn co be an uncontrolable multiple organ failure whose mortality is very high. Before infusing the necessary substrates to spare the essential proteins for a good body function, one must try first to suppress or inhibit the condition who maintains the s~ress and it's catabolic reaction what means ~o control the patient milieu, his adaption to stress and the pathological conditions responsable or whorsening stress and infection. The treatment must aim to perfuse and bring enough calories to cover the needs without causing suplementary work to the body by means of lipogenesis, glucogenogenesis and ureogenesis in ~articulary for the failing liver. In practice mos~ of the times one can only infuse a minimum of 125 to 150 g of glucose, i00 to 500 ml of 10% Intral~pid and i0 ~o 20 g nitrogen as a rich in branchchained aminoacids solution. Only repeated calorimetric measurements will allow co quantify the metabolic monitoring and to document the global metabolic care. Diet plays an important role in the treatment of diabetes mellitus and should be considered when parenteral nutrition is used. A complete nutrition solution with a calorie content consisting of 44% carbohydrate, 17% l-amino acids and 39% fat is recommended. In uncontrolled diabetes mellitus parenteral nutrition should be started after water and electrolyte imbalances is corrected and blood glucose level is decreased below I0 mmol/l and beta-hydroxy butyrate below 3 mmol/l. This can be obtained by a low dose insulin regime and rehydratation with a glucosefree electrolyte solution with 90 mmol sodium, 60 mmol chloride, 25 mmol potassium, 10 mmol phosphate, 0.5 mmol calcium, 1.5 mmol mangesium and 43 mmol malate within 1000 ml H20 and an infusion volume adjusted to the value of the central venous pressure. Total parenteral nutrition of acutelly ill diabetic patients containing 2.9 g carbohydrates, 1.1 g l-amino acids and 1.1 g fat with a caloriecontent of 26 kcal (110 kJ)/kg KG/d has been under current investigation. The results showed that the blood glucose level is maintained well by a continuous intravenous insulin dosage of 3 + 0.6 IU and no deviation of osmolality and serum lactate occured. The blood gas analysis remained unchanged. The triglycerides concentration was 0.8 + 0.12 mmol/l at the beginning and reached a steady state-of 1.3 + 0.26 mmol/l. The beta-hydroxy butyrate concentration ~howed a transient increase from 0.6 + 0.05 tO 0.9 + 0.22 mmol/l and afterwards decreased to the normal range. The intravenous infusion of a standard amino acid mixture caused no derangement of the plasma amino acid concentration during adequate supply of insulin. Therefore it can be concluded that insulin treated patients with diabetes mellitus do not need a special amino acid mixture. renal, and nutritional support are at the disposal of the intensive care units, the failure of multiple organs (MOF) has been identified not only as a disturbed function of some organs but as a syndrome-like entity with an expected mortality of more than 50%. Characterized by its progressive nature MOF may end in a complex reduction of nearly all organ functions with an at last untreatable cardiopulmonary insufficiency. The controlling factors in MOF are not well understood. Neuronal, hormonal, and other influences change the metabolic state and -as for the nutritional aspect in a wider sense of the word-one general conclusion can be drawn: in MOF cells, tissues, and organs are more or less unable to provide energy and protein synthesis in as sufficient amounts as they are needed and exactly there, where they should be used. From a practical point of view organ failure in intensive care units is connected with modalities of nutrition in different ways: it is a fact, that an incomplete nutrition or a state of malnutrition always means a risk for an additional organ failure. It is evident too, that a failing organ troubles the metabolic homeostasis so, that a normal \"classical\" nutrition is dangerous. Therefore nutrition therapy in MOF means to find a way between the necessity of avoiding symptoms of malnutrition by substituting enough substrates and between the knowledge, that this may lead to metabolic disturbances followed by a worsening of the state of illness.",

A major contributing factor to the high mortality observed in AF is the net breakdown of body cell mass. Nutritional therapy in AF is thus, mandatory. Modern principles imply frequent dialysis or ultrafiltration as early as possible after the patient has become definitely oliguric, thus allowing an adequate nutritional supply by the parenteral route. Energy should be provided as much as any intensive care patient, i.e. 10.5-12.5 MS/day or considerably more, if the patient has a marked hypermetabolism as for instance in severe burns. At least 200 g should be provided as carbohydrate in order to decrease glueoneogenesis of ketoacids. To cover the increased energy requirements the use of fat emulsions are of special value since they provide the patient with a high amount of energy in a low volume of fluid. Fat emulsion should, however, not be given unless the need of carbohydrates is satisfied. Parenteral administration of amino acids should be given to all patients with AF of more than 2-3 days duration who cannot take protein by mouth. The administration should not start until the uremic state is controlled by adequate dialysis. The optimal proportion between essential amino acids and non-essential amino acids with a daily amount of 30-60 g is to emphasize. Electrolytes and water soluble vitamins should be provided as for any intensive care patients.

Certainly, it is justified to make every efforts to prevent these patients from starvation and internal canibalism. The classical view of protein wasting in severe illness as developped by Cuthbertson in the 1930ies has been that protein breakdown results from substrate mobilisation to cover energy demands. Today we have more detailed explanatiormfor the pathogenesis of disturbed protein dynamics in catabolic states. The general view is that negative nitrogen balance in moderate trauma results from diminished protein synthesis without major increase in protein breakdown; adequate nutrition may restore in part the impairment of protein synthesis. In contrast, severe trauma is associated with accelerated protein breakdown out of proportion to energy requirements. Protein synthesis may be enhanced provided that adequate nutrition is supplied. The overall metabolic alterations in severe catabolic states are enhanced protein breakdown, ongoing fat oxidation, relative inhibition of glucose oxidation, and failure to increase hepaticproduction of ketone bodies as alternative fuel. This maladaptation is, at least in part, explained by elevated stress hormones, such as glucocorticoids and epinephrine. They result in enhanced protein breakdown and fat mobilisation, they induce insulin resistance and thus hyperinsulinemia. Results are presented demonstrating inhibition of hepatic ketogenesis by insulin; glucose utilization may be impaired due to elevated free fatty acid levels. Therapeutic measures include avoidance of stress, catabolic hormones and administration of insulin as a potent anticatabolic agent. In addition, adapted nutrition should cover the altered requirements of carbohydrates, fat and amino acids.",

It is now well established that in illness this pathway is blocked while the inactive pathway of T4 degradation via rT3 remains intact. Hence in disease serum T3 can be as low as in severe hypothyroidism and serum T4 values can also be markedly reduced. Clinically it is however easy to exclude primary hypothyroidism (but not secondary hypothyroidism) by a serum TSH measurement which will remain normal even if both, serum T3 and T4 are markedly decreased, the low serum T3 and total and free T4 levels being therefore diagnostically useless. Are these hormonal changes adequate adaptations to the sick state or do they indicate a partial deficiency in thyroid hormones ? The majority of indices favor the hypothesis of an adequate adaptation : kinetic studies have shown that the low serum T4 levels are in part explained by an increased metabolic clearance rate, the production rate being only moderatly reduced. The effect on the target tissues have been studied in the model of the starving rat : there is evidence for a partial resistance to T3 with nuclear receptors clearly decreased which is not typical for hypothyroidism.

Out of 335 consecutive patients admitted to an intensive care unit 20 patients suffering from severe non-endocrine diseases (septicaemia, fulminant hepatic and renal failure, acute pancreatitis, polytrauma, cerebral haemorrhage) were found to have serum total thyroxine (TT4) levels in the hypothyroid range (below 4~g/dl). Serum concentrations of TT4 (2.3~O.2~g/dl), triiodothyronine (TT3, O.23+O.O3ng/ml), and thyroxine binding globuline (iS.5~l.3~g/ml) were reduced, but were above normal for reverse T3 (0.43+0.06 ng/ ml). The response of TSH secretion to iv TRR was Tound to be either normal, lowered or absent. Primary hypothyroidism was excluded, as no enhanced TSH response was observed in any case. Although decreased TT4 levels may be due to increased thyroid hormone degradation it appears that associated impaired TSH responsiveness to TRH may result from illness-related inhibition of pituitary TSH release. Even though free T4 serum levels may also be decreased in some of the patients at the summit of their illness, the metabolic response to thyroid hormone deficiency is to be expected with considerable delay. Although the finding of decreased thyroid hormone levels is not rare in intensive care patients, it represents an index of poor prognosis. Differentiation between this \"low-T4 syndrome\" and true hypothyroidism depends essentially on clinical symptoms and course of disease. If there is no clinical evidence of hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone substitution may not only lack a rational basis, but due to their cardiotropic action could also endanger some of these patients.

J.Eckart,Augsburg,FRG Indirect calorimetry is the method in use today for providing data on total energy expenditure and on the amount and composition of the oxidized fuel. The metabolic rate can he calculated by multiplying oxygen uptake by the oxygen caloric equivalent corresponding to the RQ. The respiratory quotient is the ratio of the volume of carbon dioxide produced to the volume of oxygen consumed over a given interval of time. Whereas fats and carbohydrates are completely oxidized,proteins are not. Each gram of urinary nitrogen signifies a respiratory exchange of 4.7 liters CO 2 and 5.9 liters 0 2 . Handling of water and electrolytes results under physiological circumstances from neural, humoral, cardiovascular and renal mechanisms. Mechanical ventilation interferes with several of these regulatory circles, causing generally water and sodium retention(1). The changes are more marked when positive end-expiratory pressure(PEEP) is applied, and in most studies PEEP was used to amplify the underlying mechanisms. The following factors are involved: l)Increased intrathoracic pressures elevates central venous pressure, decreases venous return and cardiac output. 2) Renal function is impaired by changes in intrarenal perfusion(2) leading to water and salt retention.3) Antidiuretic hormone secretion is increased during both short(5) and long term positive pressure ventilation(4).4) Plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone are increased(6). ~1ost of these mechanisms are more important during controlled or intermittent mandatory ventilation than during spontaneous breathing with positive airway pressure(8).The application of dopamine or dopamine with dobutamine improves water and sodium excretion in ventilated patients(3,7). It is not clear if water retention during mechanical ventilation is part of an adaptive mechanism to the decreased cardiac filling or simply due to a dysregulation of the mentionned circulatory and neurohumoral factors. Depending upon severity and duration of hypovolemia, hypovolemia-induced activation of the sympathetic nervous system and deterioration of the fluidity of blood, the microvascular perfusion becomes impaired with the final result of tissue hypoxia and depletion of the extravascular fluid compartments. The length of time, a trauma patient has remained hypovolemic is critical for survival due to promotion of multiorgan failure with duration of hypovolemia and shock, respectively. Primary therapy should replace the colloidal fluid actually lost. The aim of initial volume substitution, however, is not only to restore circulating volume and central haemodynamics but to counteract at the same time the secondary impairment of the microcirculation. By virtue of their oncotic power and capacity to retain water within the circulation, red cell free colloid solutions should preferably be used for primary volume replacement in trauma patients. From the artificial colloids, Dextran 70 is considered most suitable due to its long lasting volume and blood fluidity improving effect. Cristalloids have proven satisfactory, however, intravascular refill requires 2.5 -4 times the volume loss and intensive haemodynamic monitoring. Independent upon the initial fluid used, a fall of haemoglobin to 10 -8 g/100 ml calls for red cells. RBC-concentrates/FFP and fresh whole blood are both efficient to control deficits of oxygen carriers and plasmatic clotting factors.",

We performed thoracotomy in 8% of such hospitalized patients. There are clearly defined indications for surgery: Hassive and persistent bleeding, acute cardiac tamponade, rupture of trachea, bronchi, aorta, supraaortic branches, and diaphragm. Operative stabilization of the chest wall should be considered in exceptional cases. Hany restricting factors are involved in such an operation, and in many cases it is just not necessary. Conditions are similar in the case of penetrating injuries. Here too, th0racotomy is reserved for precisely defined indications. Many cases can be treated by conservative management~ which does not mean being inactive. Immediate thorac0t0my~ however, is the keyt0 success in all penetrating heart injuries,and this applies particularly to situations that are apparently hopeless. Th0raeotomy was performed in #9 out of 155 penetrating thoracic injuries (#8% of which were gunshot wounds). In this series, 36 heart injuries are included. Mortality was 5.5%. Cardiac failure may be due to abnormal alterations in preload, afterload, contractility and heart rate. Therapy and management of the failing heart therefore has to consider positive inotropic drugs as well as vasodilating and antiarrhythmic management. Acute respiratory failure (ARF) means increase of PaCO 2 and/or low P O 2 ~ed to FIO 2. After trauma a number of pa~h61ogical conditions may cause these symptoms. Hypoxia/hypercapnia are produced by a reduction in ventilation and/or by disturbance of gas exchange, l.Ventilation may be limited mechanically (blocked airways, Pnet~othorax, flail chest), by central nervous depression (coma) or by pain (rib fractures). If causal therapy is not effective in~ediately, mechanical ventilation has to be installed without delay. High frequency ventilation may be adequate in selected cases. 2.Gas Exchange may be disturbed by localined pulmonary lesions preventing ventilation in areas still perfused (pulmonary contusion, aspiration pne~nitis) or in a diffuse change of pulmonary parenchyma beginning as interstitial edema progressing to alveolar edema and later on to interstitial fibrosis (ANDS). Although biochemical mediators may initiate ANDS, the first clinical manifestation is a capillary leak associated with and partially due to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Therapy cannot focus on the primary lesions but must (i) increase pulmonary gas voltm~ (mechanical ventilation with PEEP ) to raise P_Or and to reduce hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstrlctlon, pulr~o~ary hypertension and capmllary leakage, and (2) increase cardiac output to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular failure. Intravascular volume must be optimised and vaso-active pharmacotherapy may be necessary. However, the ini0ortant goal is difficult to reach : to get ventilation in match with perfusion. Early prophylactic steps are more effective than late therapeutic attenlos. Cortieostheroids, Heparin, Trasylol, etc. are not proven to have any effect. Head trauma is common but severe brain injury is rare. In a few patients an injury which at first sight seems minor leads to severe brain damage due to intracranial bleeding.",

On principle, trauma and shock result in an acute disproportion between oxygen supply and oxygen demand of the organism. To the fore of the cardiovascular reaction there is the sympathico-adrenergic stimulation at an reduced cardiac Output which leads to a derangement within the field of microcirculation. In a stage of compensated shock constriction of arterioles, preeapillaries and venules causes an impairment of inflow and outflow. As a result microcirculatory blood flow is redistributed thus leading to a reduction in perfusion of nutritive capillaries as well as to tissue hypoxia and anoxia. The aim of therapy must therefore be an improvement of microcirculatory blood flow. The most important factor in this connection is a rapid and complete volume replacement by dextrane, crystalloids and blood or blood fractions. Adequate oxygenation and reduction of respiratory work must be ensured early and with somnolent patients early intubation is needed in order to protect respiration. With patients in traumatic shock anesthesia should be induced with etomidate, ketamines or opioides because of the low negative inotropy and the modest influence on afterload of these agents. Subsequent to a complete volume replacement narcosis can be maintained by a combination of fentanyl, for instance, and volatile anesthetics (enflurane, halothane). In order to decrease the pressure in situation with circulatory hypertension the administration of nitroelycerine should be preferred, since sodium nitroprusside induces microcirculatory disorders. These necessary measure call for an invasive monitoring including recording of cardiac output and pulmonary pressures. Department of Surgery, Western Infirmary, Glasgow Gll 6NT.

Until now we have investigated 9 patients with ARDS.ACE activity was measured spectophotometrically in progress of ARDS (range 8-32 days; method described by Cushman and Cheung)and was correlated to data of pulmonary gas exchange (AaD0o,Pa02,PaC0o,O~/~t)and thoraco-pulmonary compllance. 60 h~al~y persons in comparable age were used as contol group.

Lung mechanics and pulmonary gas exchange studies were performed 6 and 12 months after the accident in 2 survivors of adult respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS)following prolonged immer sion(lO and 20 minutes)in fresh water. The patients were 25 and 29 years old and non smokers. Assisted ventilation was performed during Ig and 34 days respectively.Measurements included spirometry,lung compliance,distribution of ventilation,transfer factor of carbon monoxyde(DLCO), membrane factor(DM),pulmonary capillary volume, gas exchanges at rest and during exercise. Resulb indicate that lung mechanics returned to normal within 8 months after the onset of ARDS.No alterations of DLCO or changes of the distribution nf ventilation were detected. Conversely,the ratb of dead space to tidal volume was significantly increased at rest and during exercise,and the ra tio of capillary volume to alveolar volume was decreased in both patients.lt is concluded that AROS following pro]onged near drowning in adults causes late abnormalities of gas exchange probably related to decreased pulmonary capillary volumed The aim of this study was to point out the interest of g~ exchanges and compliance monitoring of the patients submitted to controlled ventilation during ARDS. 34 patients supported the study (Mendelson's syndrom 18 -Lung contusion 9 -Viral pneumonitis 4 -Fat embolism 3).

However, when DucC02 < 0,70, the predictive value of death is bad (PV = 50 %).

The ~a/Q-distribution was unaltered when F~O 2 was increased from a mean of 29% to 53%. A further i~crease in FIO 9 to a mean of 85% caused a further widening of the ~A/Q-distribution, and an increase in true shunt (V8/Q = O) from 7% to 10% of cardiac output (p,~ 0.0]). Hdwever, there was no fractional increase in low\" VA/Q, except for one patient.

The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (P.E.) is difficult with ventilation-perfusion scanning in patients having a reduced ventilation in the region of the perfusion defects (matched defect) as in.chronic obstructive lung disease (C.O.P.DJ Regional V/Q were therefore computed in each region of a perfumion defect in 44 patients with angiographically confirmed P.E. and 40 patients with C.O.P.D. by dividing ventilation scan by perfusion scan obtained with Krypton 81m in tidal breathing with a gamma-camera linked to a computer. The regional ventilation-perfusion ratios were computed in each region of a perfusion defect. All the patients were studied supine in post6rior view. P.E. was characterized by mismatched defects (reduced perfusion and normal ventilation) with a high V/Q (1.96 \u2022 O.1 SD) due to vascular obstruction. A high O/Q (1.37 \u2022 0.2 SD) was also found in the 25 out of 93 defects of perfusion which were matched by a ventilation defect or a radiological opacity in these patients. Low V/Q'S were observed in the non embolic lung due to relative hyperperfusion. C.O.P.D. was characterized by matched defects with low ~/~ in most of the cases (.74 ~ .1 SD) and the two groups (P.E. and C.O.P.D.) with matched defects differed significantly (p < 0.01). This regional quantitative analysis provides a simple mean to discriminate the defects of perfusion due to P.E. from those due to a reduced ventilation. This studydemonstrated that there was no significant difference in CI, P, SI, LVSWI, TPRI, a-vo2, Q2 and P~ between CPPV and HFJV at 100.min and at the same PaCO 2 and PEEP.

However in those clinical cases with pulmonary disorders like ARDS, it is difficult to improve V and 0 by HFJV alone, because of extremely diminished lung compliance and increased dead space. So we have attempted the new method, accumulated highfrequency jet ventilation(Acc.-HFJV), in which the jet flow from HFJV generated by modified Bird Mark 8 has been accumulated by time-cycled regulation of the expiratory valve of CV-2000 ventilator. Aec-HFJV has improved V and 0 without compromising the characteristics of the jet flow, as compared with the superimposed mode. In addition, by using the technique of periodic interruption of the jet flow adjusted by respiratory cycles, it is possible to deliver accumulatiw e jet flow in the inspiratory phase, the expiratory phase or both.of them. We have compared Acc-HFJV with CPPV and conventional HFJV in 40 patients with ARDS at same levels of PEEP.The results have indicated that adquate Vand 0 could be maintained more effectively by using Acc-HFJV than the other two modes of ventilation.

Sistemic, central venous and pulmonary arterial pressures, cardiac output via the thermodilution technique, arterial and mixed venous blood gases, airway pressure (Paw) at the end of the endothracheal tube and oesophageal pressure were monitored, Cardiac and stroke indices (Cl, SI), pulmonary and sistemic vascular resistances (PVR, SVR) and right and left ventricular stroke Work~ indices (RVSWI, LVSWI) were calculated using standard equations Wentilation was performed randomly with a volume-cycled ventilator (3100 Roche) at 15 b/m and with an HFJV apparatus (VJP system) at 60, 120, 240, 480 b/m, regulating tidal volume to maintain PaCO 2 at 38 ~ 2 mmHg.

Mean and peak airway pressures were significantly lower with HFJV at 60 ~ 240 b/m; at 480 b/m, the end expiratory pressure was 3,7 ~ 1,2 mmHg, giving an increased mean Paw. Using HFJV at 60 \u00a7 240 b/m during haemorrhagic shock, CI, SI and LVSWI were significantly enhanced, by respectively +20%, +21% and +38%, in comparison to the control values in IPPV; a cardiovascular depression appeared at 480 b/m. These results confirm that when there is an haemodynamic impairment, as in the anaesthetized hypovolemic dog, HFJV reduces the deleterious cardiovascular effects of conven tional positive pressure Ventilation. The influence of different lung volumes on various frequencies of nigh frequency ventilation was studied in 5 anesthetized mongrel dogs (x=28.9kg). After intubation, using a special developed endotracheal tube, dogs were placed in a rigid heat-exchanged pressure box (p.b.) with variable internal pressure (range: -1o to +5 cmH20). Ventilation was performed: A. under conditions of IPPV (f= o.2 Hz), B. as \"forced d~ffusion ventilation\"(FDV), a ~mdified nigh frequency jet ventilation(f=6Hz,5oHz, cont.=jet stream without any chopper frequency). By variing b.p. (-1o/o/+5cmHgO), different levels of lung volume were achieved. PartiCular combinations of b.p. and respirator settings were selected in random fashion. Blood gases, mixed expiratory CO_ (Fm-CO 9) and minute volume The authors investigated the relationship between physiological dead space (Vd) and tidal volume (Vt) during high frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) at different positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels (0 -2.0 kPa). Four healthy Beagle dogs, IIM7 kg, were anaesthetized, pa ralized and intubated in the standard fashion; ventilatio~ was performed with intermittent (IPPV) or continuous (CPPV) positive pressure at 15 b/m and HFJV at 60, 120, 240, 480 b/m, while minute volume (~)wasregulatedtomaintain PaCO 2 at 38 ~ 2 mmHg. For each mode of ventilation arterial blood samples for gas analysis were taken after 10 min of stabilization. The volume of alveolar ventilation in a single breath (Va) and in a minute (~a) were calculated analyzing the values obtained with a pneumotachograph (Vt) and with Bohr's equation modified by Enghoff (Vd).",

Four;healthy Beagle dogs, II~17 kg, were anaesthetized, paralized and intubated in the standard fashion.Catheters were introduced for the measurement of sistemic, central venous and pulmonary arterial pressures, arterial and mixed venous blood gases; cardiac output was evaluated via the thermodilution technique. Cardiac and stroke indices (Cl,Sl), pulmonary vascular and total peripheral resistan ces (PVR,TPR) and right and left cardiac work indices (RCWI,LCWI) were calculated using standard equations. HFJV was performed at 120 b/m, with minute volume (V) regulated to maintain PaC02 at 38 ~ 2 mmHg and a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) from 0 to 2.0 kPa. The haemodynamic influence of HFJV was evaluated when progres sively delaying the inspiratory peak corresponding to th~ onset of the 'R' wave on the ECG trace. The mean pulmonary arterial pressure oscillations decrease as PEEP rises and their value reaches a maximum of 15% at zero PEEP. Lowest PVR and RCWI values were observed when the inspiratory peak coincided with the protomesodiastolic phase of the cardiac cycle (that is at 30-70% of R-Rinter val) and the highest values when the peak drops close tothe R wave (~ 20% R-R). This phenomenon occours independently from the PEEP level applied. The results demonstrate the absence of significant haemodynamic effects due to ECG and inspiratory peak synchroni zation when HFJV is applied to anaesthetized dogs with normal cardiovascular reserve and lung compliance. ~he usefulness of vasodilators in the treahnent of pulmonary hypertension (PHT) following chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has not yet been established, especially during acute exacerbation of the disease. phentolamine (Ph), a potent systemic vasodilator drug, is known to act on the pulmcnary circulation as well.

In order to validate this hypothesis, KETANSERIN (K) a specific 5 HT2 receptor antagonist, was used in COPD. METHODS : 9 patients (ranged 50 to 75 years old) with COPD ~I Research Council Criteria) were studied during acute exacerbation of respiratory failure (4 breathing, spontaneously 5 mecanically ventilated). All were free of treatment except antibiotics. Haemodynamic parameters were systemic arterial pressure (MAP), pulmonary capillary wedge (PWP), pulmonary arterial (PAP), and right atrial pressure (RAP) (Swan-Ganz 7F), cardiac output (CI) (Thermodilutiontechnique), heart rate (HR). Simultaneous sampling or arterial (a) and venous (v) blood permitted measurement of oxygen and carbon dioxide tension, hemoglobin saturation leading to calculate venous admixture (Qs/Qt) (Fi02 : .21). Then 10 mg of (K) were given intravenously followed by a continuous infusion of 4 mg/hour. RESULTS : are summarised in the 2) The constant increase in venous admixture is not always related to CI changed so, when Cl decrease lowers P~02, its variation may explain venous admixture increment 3) On the other hand, the constant decrease in V02 may be related to sympathetic blocking property of this drug. It has been shown, that the ratio between thromboxane and prostacyclin might be an important factor in acute pulmonary hypertension in sheep treated with E.coli endotoxin (i). On this basis we gave ibuprofen to two patients with acute pulmonary hypertension to convert the thromboxane/prostacyclin ratio in advantage of prostacyclin. One patient suffering from severe ARDS (effective compliance below 18 ml/cm H20 , pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) 56/38 mm Hg, P O 2 i0 kPa F.O~ 0 6 PEEP i0 \" i z \" ' cm H20, balloon occlusion pulmonary angiogram showed pulmonary artery filling defects and thrombi) -and another patient suffering from multiple pulmonary embolism verified by ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy. In the first case a dose of 50 mg/honr of ibuprofen was given i.v., and in the second case a dose of 1200 mg daily was given orally. In both cases PAP fell -in the first case from 56/38 mm Hg to 40/15 mm Hg, and in the second case from 92/37 rm~ Hg to 25/12 mm Hg. PAO2 increased in the patient with ARDS with 4s9 kPa with a constant FiO 2 and constant PEEP. In the second case the P 02 increased from 8,8 kPa to 10,4 kPa. No adverse e~ects were seen.

This decrease was accompanied by a decrease of PaO 2 without any change of PaCO 2 (supine 77 \u2022 12 mmHg, lateral decubitus 70 ~ 15 mmHg p~..O.02). These results suggest that over perfusion of non embolic regions is involved in hypoxemia during P.E. The amount of oxygen consumed by the work of breathing can be calculated as the difference in total 0auptake (V02) during controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) and spontaneous breathing (SB). Whereas this difference is well known in normal subjects (I -2%) the oxygen cost of breathing in patients with mitral valve disease is still subject of discussion. In 8 patients V02 was measured continously according to the method of Neuhof (Crlt.Care Med. 6:155,1978) durlng CMV after mitral valve replacement on the operative day and on the first postoperative day after weanlngfrom the respirator during SB. In every patient mean V02 was increased during SB (172,0 + 14, ml 02/m2/min) in comparlslon to CMV (137,5 ~ 12,~ ml 02/m2/min), the mean difference was 25,5~, with a range of.7,4% to 34,9%. Other factors which might influence V02 (physical activity, body temperature, nutrition, and acid-base status) did not change significantly during both periods of investigation. Because the cardiac index did not vary (2,73 + 0,76 1/m2/mln during SB, 2,68 ~ 0,79 i/m2/min during CMV) the grea~er 02-demand during SB could only be met by an increase in av-D02 (6,50 + 1,22 ml 02/100 ml during SB, 5,15 ~ 1,12 ml 02/I~0 ml during CMY). The results confirm that the oxygen cost of breathing is a significant fraction of whole body V02 during the immediate postoperative period in patients after mltral valve replacement.

They were first ventilated in a conventional way, using IMV-CPAP, IRV or HFV.Hemodinamic monitoring was instituted together with control of tissue pH and P02. As their conditions did not show any improvement, they were switched to ILV, thus allowing the demonstration of a persisting gradient in static compliance and the subsequent modulation of the ventilatory techniques. The less compliant lung was ventilated with HFV, the other either with IMV-CPAP or with HEY. The results are consistent with our hypotesis.

Dept of Medicine South Hospital,Stockholm, Sweden. Differential ventilation (DV) in the lateral posture has shown to improve the gas-exchange in patients with severe acute respiratory failure due to bilateral lung disease. The mechanism is most certainly the countering of airway closure (AC) within the dependent lung. Also patients undergoing sus in the lateral position have a preferential spread off AC towards the dependent lung. The presenl study was thus undertaken to evaluate fihe efiFect of DV during routine anaesthesia in the lateral position. Ten patients without history of cardio-pulmonary disease were investigated prior to major surgery. The patients were intubated by a double-lumen catheter. Ventilation was performed with ONE ventilator (i.e conventional ventilation) and by TWO ventilatos with 50 % of the tidal volume to each lung (DV). Anaesthesia was maintained with enflurane and the patients were kept in the lateral positione during the ceus off the study. Ventilation of each lung was determined by Argon dilution technique and a masspeetrsmeher. Central heamodynamies was measured using a Swan-Ganz thes catheter. In some of the patients , regional perFusion through each lung was studied by a gamma-camera. Results: DV as compared to conventional ventilation resulted in a 26 % decrease in venous admixture and a 23 % increment of arterial oxygen tension (p<O.01)~ while the cardiac output was not significantly altered. In the patients by which the regional distribution of pulmonary blood-flow was studied~ it could be established that DV also resulted in a much more even distribution of pulmonary perfusion between the upper and the lower lung. It is concluded that differential ventilation with 50 % of the tidal volume to each lung improves ventilation versus perfiusion and thus oxygenation during routine anaesthesia in the lateral position.",

Versprille, Dept. of pulmonary diseases, pathsphysiological laboratory and Dept. of surgery, Erasmus University, P.O. Box 1738, 3000 DR Rotterdam, The Netherlands IPPV, especially to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, may necessitate either a relatively high tidal volume or a positive end expiratory pressure to obtain sufficient gas exchange. The risks are barotrauma during peakinflation and airtrapping during deflation. To avoid these harmful effects we searched for another mode of ventilation, which improves gas exchange. The effects of prolonged and diminished expiratory flow during IPPV was studied on gas exchange in pigs. Under normal pulmonary conditions these animals were ventllated with a Servo-900 A ventilator an a mean tidal volume of 15 ml kg -I , and a rate of i0 min -I. If spontaneous explration was retarded to the total available expiratory time, a significant increase in Pa02(10%) and decrease in PACO2(8.5%) was observed. Physiological dead space was decreased as well (28%). These effects were compared to those of a PEEP which increased mean tracheal pressure to the same extent as the prolonged expiration. PEEP less improved a PaO ~ (+5%), but did not influence PaCe2 with respec~ to normal IPPV. Cardiac output decreased under both circumszan: ces to the same amount (-18%). We conclude that prolonged and diminished expiration flow has a rationale, when IPPV alone causes problems regarding gas exchange and PEEP is contraindicated. Intrapulmonary gas exchange, effective pulmQna~ blood flow,ventilation-perfusion matching (V/Q), respiratory mechanics (in vivo oxyhemometry,mass spectrometry, pneumotacho~raphy ), systemic and pulmonary hemodynamies (SWAN -GANZ catheter, thermodilution)were studied in 300 patients with respiratory insufficiency (RI) who needed re~iratory support. ECMO ( Oxygenator MOST-122, USSR) was used in11 patients with acute R!: in 5 patients as an extreme measure in the irreversible terminals t ate, and in 6 patients along with other measures of intensive care with mechanical ventilation (MV) in an extremely intensive regime ( high PEEP , toxic FvOo)and progressively reducing PaOo/FvO ~. During EChO PaOo in all the patients in~reas~d and it became possible to pass over to a less intensive MV regime. ( One patient survived smc~g 6 patients). Venous-venous ECMO effectively increases blood oxygenation and favcurably influences the pulmonary tissue metabolism and V/Q. Venous-arterial ECMO is advisable in such cases with concomitant cardiac failure. The low frequency of favourable outlets after EOMO may be explained by limitat~n of indications for it, the retarded beginning, hematologic and technical problems. In the conditions of progressive reduction of PaO~/ FTO ~ (FTO~I,0 ; high PEEP,dehydration, cardiac~the2a h PY2 St is advisable to apply ECMO before the development of critical hypoxia.",

However, experiments interrupting afferent pathways of this reflex by cutting or cooling the vagus nerves, failed to eliminate the typical renal response to shifts in positive airway pressure. The influence of changes in intrathoracic pressure by intermittent mandatory and controlled mechanical ventilation (IMV /CMV) on renal function without and with a specific blockade of cardiac stretch receptors using 2 % procaine instillation in the pericardium (PLA) was studied in anaesthetized dogs. Institution of PLA during spontaneous breathing depressed all measured parameters of global circulatory and renal function such as urine flow, osmolar-, inulin-, and PAH-clearance. During mechanical ventilation (IMV/CMV) circulatory and renal function parameters further decreased and showed the most detrimental effects during CMV. However, IMV and CMV still caused similar changes in the kidney function as without the blockade of cardiac stretch receptors as described previously by us. Hence, although there is a marked influence of the stretch receptor volume regulating reflex on kidney function, this mechanism does not primarily govern the alteration in renal function induced by shifts in airway pressures. Fluid management in the critically ill patient on high levels of PEEP can be a difficult task. PEEP may cause the cardiac index to fall due to a decrease in left ventricular preload.",

Polymorphonuclear leucocytes constitute a major line of defense for the lung against the dangers of acute bacterial infection by virtue of their ability to phagocytize and kill the invading organisms. Since phagocytosis is associated with an increased phospholipid synthesis presumably serving in renewal and modification of membranes required for phagocytic function we asked thequestionis this function impaired in situations where other cell types may compete for the same substrates of phospholipid metabolism as occurs in the lung where type II alveolar cells are known to have a high phospholipid turnover. We therefore studied the rate of phagocytosis during increased phospholipid synthesis in isolated type II alveolar cells. Type II cells isolated from rabbit lungs were incubated in Krebs-Ringer phosphate (KRP) medium (pH 7.4) containing thyrotropin (TSH) for i hr at 37~",

Univ.-Klinik, 8700 W~'zburg, FR(3 Glucose controlled infusion systems allow the treatment of cardiogenic shock with pharmacological doses of insulin. Methods: 12 critically ill patients in prolonged cardiogenic shock after myocardial infarction with fatal prognosis and exhausted therapy received a 2000 IF-insulin bolus and 2000 IE insulin per hour in the following. Blood glucose was automatically regulated with 70 % glucose sell,ion by a glucose controlled infusion system (Biostator GC[IS'~). Prior to and 30, 60, 120, 180, 240 min. after the beginning of therapy and 2,4 and l0 hours after therapy the hemodynamic changes, insulin, glucagon, pyruvate, lactate, citrate, 2-oxogluturate, 13-hydroxybuturate and aoetoacetate were determined. Results: Insulin therapy resulted in an increase of cardiac output, ~as significant (p < 0,05) at all times of determination and amounted 11,3 % after 30 minutes and 23 % after 4 hours. Heart rate remained unchanged except for the first 30 rain. where a significant increase of 5.6 % was recorded; according to this stroke volume attained values after 1 h which were 20 % higher than before therapy and remained at this elevated level during the four hours period of insulin treatment. Weiler index decreased significantly about 34 % indicating increased myocardial contractility. Beyond this we found a significant increase of central venous oxygen saturation, a significant decrease of lactate and a tendency of decreasing of citrate and 2-oxogluturate levels. Glucose and potassium blood levels remained in the desired range after substitution. After disruption of insulin treatment the hemodynamic starting level was reattained. Discussion: After exhausting conventional measures -including catee\"-o'h~'amines -this therapy resulted in an improvement of cardiac index, myocardial contractility and chemical parameters in blood. The two receptor modetl of insulin effects may explain, why high insulin doses can achieve effects, which cannot be found after lower insulin doses. AR-L 115 BS is a new positive inotropic agent, structurally not related to glycosides nor to catecholamines. AR-L 115 BS was infused at 1,4 mg/min for 6 hours, then discontinued, after another 6 hours the drug was readministered for 6 more hours in 11 patients with severe heart failure (NYHA class IV). Hemodynamic measurements and plasma level were obtained before administration (C), hourly during both perfusions, and during the 6 hours following each perfusion period. The cardiac index (CI), the stroke volume index (SVI) and the left ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI) were significantly increased. The pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PWP) and the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) fell significantly. Heart rate and blood pressure remained unchanged (x = p < O.OO5). In the beginning of recompensation of congestive heart failure (CHF) it was possible to show that of 65 patients 9.2% had accompanying peripheral thrombosis of the deep veins of the legs (1-125 fibrinogen technique).

The therapeutic administration of high doses of insulin together with glucose and potassium achieves a shifting of metabolism us glycogenesis and glycolysis, providing an increased amount of energy rich phosphates. One half out of 16 patients undergoing mitral valve replacement received insulin I U/kg/h together with glucose 0.5 g/ kg/h from onset of anaesthesia until aortic cross clamping. After a 26 min average time of ischaemia a cut-out papillary muscle-tip was immediately plunged into liquid nitrogen and the content of ATP, ADP and CP (creatine phosphate) was determined. In contrast to the control group (Ringer's lactate) the insulin group showed a significant (p<o.oi) higher myocardial content of ATP (7.98 amol/g wet weight vs. 4.54 ~mol/g) and CP (6.78 ~mol/g vs. 5.16 ~mol/ g).

The PA pressures values of the first postoperative hour and the third week control are the same. After mitral valve replace, a mean PA pressure of 40 mHg has a poor prognosis. Two criteria of seriousness are noted : a CI lower than two I/me/m2 in the preoperative time and a TI liaV.ed with the mitral valvulopathy. Feasibility of propranolol (P) infusion to maintain chronic P therapy in the postoperative period was studied when patients cannot take drugs orally. Methods : Seven coronary patients (angina grade III NYHA, 56 ~ 4 yrs) undergoing intraabdominal surgery were selected. They received their last P dose (60-120 mg daily) at 8 pm the day before surgery (Po). Postoperatively P infusion started at about 2 pm (B) (normothermia and normal blood gases) with a first iv dose (0.2 mg/kg in i0 min) followed by a constant infusion (I mg/kg/day) until oral P could be taken again (24-66 hrs). Plasma P concentrations (C) were measured at Po, B and 5, i0, 60 min, 4, 6, 12, 18, 24 hrs after B. Haemodynamic data were simultaneously collected from radial artery and Swan Ganz catheters. Holter monitoring was performed before and after P infusion. Results : From 60 min to 24 hrs mean C (58-80 ng/ml) was in the therapeutic range (i). At B there was a statistically significant increase in heart rate (HR), rate pressure product (RPP) and cardiac index (CI), when compared to Po data. Beneficial haemodynamic results (decrease of HR and RPP compared to B, p<O.01) without any adverse effects (PWP and CI unchanged compared to Po) were observed over the period ranging from i0 min to 24 hrs. Ecg traces showed no ischaemic or rhythmic change. Discussion : In this study expected activity of P is achieved by this infusion way within i0 min over 24 hrs. As compared to a previous study (2) our method is able to achieve P therapeutic level more rapidly because of its starter dose and is performed during a longer time. Closing volume\" (CV), closing capacity (CC), FRC, extravascular lung water (ELW) and pulmonary hemodynamics have been measured by the methods based on mass-spectrometry, pneumotachography, Swan-Ganz catheterization and thermodilution in 47 pts before and at the early period after valve replacement (VR). Postoperative changes in ELW were expressed by a ELW/FRC ratio because ELW depended on antropometric characteristics and effective alveolar volume even in healthy persons. The ELW/FRC increased almost twice during first postoperative hours compared with preoperational value and remained at the same level for 2-3 p.o. days. Close correlation (r=0,67) has been observed between ELW/FRC and CC/FRC. CC/FRC increased after VR and became more than 1,0 in most cases. A more pronounced CC/FRC and ELW/FRC increase was observed in pts with LV cardiac failure. Hemodynamic improvement (isuprel, dopamine, nitroprussid) and lung ventilation optimization resulted in a ELW/FRC decrease, gas exchange improvement, and allowed adequate infusion therapy. No dependance of ELW elevation on qua2ity and quantity of infused solutions and on pulmonary artery pressu -~ re was observed. An increase in plasma protein (from 45 to 75 g/I) by albumin infusion was found surprisingly low-effective for water recruitment from lung tissue,probably because of increased capillary wall permeability and elevated perlvascular colloid-osmotic pressure. The ELW increase after open-heart surgery resulted in an increase of pulmonary tissue specific weight and gravitational lung gradient; obviously that contributed to a CV increase, V/Q decrease and blood oxygenation disorders.",

Schmuziger, Rehabilitationszentrum Bad Krozingen, West-Germany From 1977 to 1982 patients underwent operative treatment for ascending aortic dissections (type i: n=15, type II: n=7) by dacron graft replacement of the ascending aortaalone (n=7) or combined with aortic valve replacement (eomposite graft) in 15 patients. For preoperative evaluation and postoperative follow-up of the disease, we prefered echographic imaging of the aorta and its major branches, using a system of multiple short and long axis cross-sections obtained from parasternal, suprasternal, paravertebral, subcostal and abdominal echowindows. In 17 patients the dissection was primarily defined by echography, in 5 patients by angiography prior to the echographic examination. In 14 patients the operation was based on echographic findings without angiography. In all cases the echoaortographic findings were confirmed. Preoperative echoaortography demonstrated aseending aortic aneurysms in 21 (diameter 5-9 cm), aortic valve regurgitation in 15, perieardial effusion in 15, distal extension of the dissection to the aortic arch in 15, to arch branches -especially to the brachiocephalic artery -in 8, to the descending aorta in 14, and down to the iliac arteries in 4 cases. Serial postoperative follow-up (from I week to 5 years) of type I dissections (n=12 survivors) which were corrected only partially by the ascending aortic graft, revealed occlusion of the distal dissection in 8, persistence in 4, and progression in I patient. Descending aortic aneurysms developed within 2 years in 4 patients, leading to successful reoperation in I patient. Conclusion: Echoaortography is not only an excellent method for the diagnosis of aortic dissections, but may also improve the understanding of aortic pathology in chronic dissection by serial longtime follow-up. Systemic O2'extraction (EsO2) is impaired during severe sepsis, leading to a state of ischemia in muscles. To test the hypothesis that E. O2 may also be altered such 6 pts were studied G~sometric, metabolic (lactate) and hemodynamic investigations were performed using Swan-Ganz and Wilton-Webster catheters respectively for cardiac output (CO) and coronary si.nus flow (CSF) by thermodilution technics. Systemic and M 02 consumption (~O2, M?O2) and M lactate extraction (EwL) were calculated. The doses of Db were gradu~lly increased until the vanishing of peripheral signs of shock. The pulmonary wedge pressure was maintained to i0 mm Hg using volume expansion and dopamine (Dp) : 3 Ng/kg/ni~ The doses of Dp were increased to iO pg when the doses of Db were higher than 20 pg, in relation to vasodilatator effects of Db (ArP) has been known as a potent vasodilator. Purine nucleotides play a physiological role in regulating coronary blood flow. ATP may be released from intramural purinergic nerves, acting on purinoceptors in the vessel wall and therefore producing vasodilation. This study evaluates the possible role of ATP in producing deliberate hypotension in dogs. In 6 piritramide anaesthetized dogs, ventilated with 0J N20, a femoral artery catheter and a Swan Ganz thermod~lution catheter were introduced. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), mean right atrial pressure (RAP), mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), heart rate (HR)~ pulmonary wedge pressure (PCWP), cardiac output (CO), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and stroke volume :(SV) were estimated. A continous i.v. infusion of ATP was given, starting with a dose of I mg/ kg/min and stepwise increasing it every five minutes to a maximum dose of 5 mg/kg/min. All data were analyzed by students' t-test, p~ 0.05 was considered significant. A dose dependent decrease in MAP, PAP, RAP, PCWP, SVR, PVR occured in all dogs inraediately after ATP administration. The decrease in MAPwas 55 % +/-8 % with 5 mg/kg/min. During the whole experiment CO and HRincreased, SV remained unchanged. ATP seems to be a possible agent for deliberate hypotension.",

The source of our results is a group of ten patients with a diagnosis of shock based upon hemodynamic and metabolic criteria together with the monitoring of tissular P02. The above shock states, either hypo or hyperdynamic, were studied with regard to the redox mitochondrial activity and the levels of some substrates of Krebs'Cycle in muscular needle biopsies. During the evolution of shock in the examined patients we have observed a significant reduction (one tenth of normal values) of the activity of cyt. oxydase (COx), of succynate cyt.c reductase (SCR) and of~-oxogIUtarate cyt.c reductase(OgCr). Moreover in all the hypodynamic shock states we have observed an irreversible \"inhibition\" of cyt.c oxydase. The tissue and plasma levels of some substrates of Krebs'Cycle (cytrate, succynate,malate,~-oxoglutarate,pyruvate and lactBte) have shown a close biofunctional relationship with the redox capacity of the electron transport chain (ETC). We could demonstrate a good correlation among tissue perfusion, intracellular 02 metabolization and mitochondrial oxydative capacity. Our results seem to open new and unexplored fields for the research on shock states in the human being. We have built a new display which measures the blood flow in the descending portion of the thoracic aorta with an oesophageal probe. The instrument consists of : -a Doppler directional velocimeter of continuous frequency emission, -an ultrasonic pulse echo system for measurement of aortic section. This work compares measurements of thermodilution cardiac output (TDco) with descending aortic blood flow (Ao DF 2). The cardiac output range was between 1.9 to 13.1 1 x min -I The correlation between theses methods, based on 300 simultaneous determinations involving 21 patients is the following : TDco : 0,473 = (1,110 xAoF) r = 0,977 p < O,001 The measurement of descending aortic blood flow by the ultrasound oesophageal probe here described is of easy realisation, non invasive and non traumatic for the unconscious patient.",

The long term survival rate was 74 % : death oceured as a result of cardiac or multiple malformations, 3 to 36 months after surgery. 74 children were followed up prospectively for periods between 3 and 6 months, then every year 9 Data were obtained from physical examination and esophagography (performed at one year) 9 Other investigations, such esophagoscopy, tracheoscopy were performed in case of respiratory complication. Results : The following diagnosis were established : 9 chronic suppuration of the bronchus in 24 % 9 esophageal stricture in 28 % 9 gastroesophageal reflux in 23 % Correlation between respiratory and esophageal sequelae was noted 9 Our results stress the need for an early and systematic detection of esophageal abnoma]ities, particularly when responsible for the recurrent respiratory problems, and for an antiref]ux procedure 9 We have reported on the possibility of continuous non invasive monitoring of ICP in neonates and its clinical diagnostic relevance (I). It is our aim to develop a sensor which measures ICP with sufficient precision and which is inexpensive and easy to handle. Our latest developement uses a commercially available strain gauge pressure transducer with a flat surface which is in direct contact with the skin of the head above the fontanelle. This method requires the pressure transducer to be pressed against the head skin with a certain force. This is accomplished individually in each application by a step motor drive which can alter the depth of the transducer relatively to the sensor case. The action of the step motor is controlled by a microprocessor which also porvides an automatic routine to find the optimum position by analyzing the signal of the transducer in relation to its deflection. In order to investigate the influence of the skin membrane on the accuracy of pressure transmission between the intracranial system and the transducer, we applied membranes with various compliances to a water filled artificial head with a fontanelle opening. By varying the water pressure below these simulated \"head skins\" and recording the transducer signal, we found a linear function within the physiological range (10-50 cm water) for all kinds of membranes. We averaged the various slpoes and found a maximum deviation of 6%. For this reason, we assume the real head skin to have similar pressure transmission characteristics. Consequently a sensivity calibration is not necessary before in vivo application. ",

Concentrated HCI (.25 N) was infused in 15 critically ill patients who presented either with a pH of A40-145 and a PaC02 >45 torr (group A, n=9), or with a pH of Z35-%40 and a PaCO 2 9 torr (group B, n=6).

HCI was infused into the superior vena cava at the rate of lO0 ml/hour until the bicarbonate concentration was below 26 mM/L, or the pH below ~35 (group A) or 730 (group B). The decrease in PaCe 2 was still significant 12 hours after the end of the HCI infusion.

The enzyme neuraminidase produced by some viruses and many bacteriae unmasks a cryptantigen(Thomsen-Friedenreich-Antigen, T-antigen). on the membrane of red cells and other cells.The T-antigen react with T-agglutinins present in all human sera resulting in a damage of these cells.lncreasing attention has been focused on the in vivo action of neuraminidase as pathogenetic agent for the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in phildren, Therefore, T-activation of red cells was investigated in 60 surgical ICU patients with suspected sep'ticemia and positive culture results. T-activated red cells were detected by apositive agglutination reaction with peanut agglutinin anti-T (lecitinof Arachis hypogea) and by an indirect hemagglutination Ah test using rabbit antiserum against anti-T. In 17 patients a significant uncovering of T-antigens on red Ah cells was detected in vitro. In 5 of these patients an acute renal failure developped,whereas only 2 of 43 T-negative patients had renal problems. There is strong ~vidence that the unmasking of T-antigens is not only limited to red cells but also does take place in the renal capillary endothelium.According to these results the neuraminidase induced activation of T-antigens may be an important factor in the etiology of acute renal failure in adult septic patients. We therefore suggest that impairment of cell immediated immunity associated with ARF is at least partly due to protein malnutrition. TBP, simple to assess, seems to be a useful tool as it is correlated with some immunologic values. A feasibility study of the efficiency of Dipyridamole (DPM) was made to find out how to prevent clotting of the extra-corporeal circuit during hemodialysis (HD) in 13 high-bleeding risk patients (pts). The bleeding risk factors were active gastro-intestinal bleeding (7 pts), aeute head trauma (3 pts), haemoperieardium (2 pts), others (3 pts). There were 2 bleeding faetors in 2 pts. DPM was infused (25 mg/h) in the \"arteria~ line of a unipuncture HD cireuit filled with normal saline. Four benign bleeding complications (6 %) and no neurologieal deterioration were noticed among 66 courses of HD. A clotting of the circuit (C.C.) needing to stop HD.(without any dangerous consequence) occured in 12 courses (18.2 %). A platelet count above 100 O00/mm3 was associated with a 23.3 % oecurenee of C.C., whereas there was none if the count was below 100.OOO. However, this differenee is not statistically significant (0.05 P 0iiO) Bleeding time before HD, the prerinsing of the circuit with heparin and infused doses of saline were not linked with frequency of C.C.",

In a controlled clinical study we compared the effectiveness of Propranolol with that of a new antihypertensive drug Urapidil on 36 patients subjected to controlled hypotension in the course of neurosurgical interventions. In 24 patients intracranial interventions were performed, whereas 12 patients (volunteers) with lumbar disc operations served as controls. One half of each group was treated with either Propranolol or Urapidil pre-and intraoperatively, the desired hypotensive level was 66% of the control value. At certain intervals we neasured Plasma Renin activity, Catecholamines, free fatty acids, arterial blood gas tensions, electrolytes, hemoglobin, P.C.V., whereas NABP and endtidal CO 2 were continuously recorded. Results: 1.-Posthypotensive hypertension following discontinuation of SNP may be due to increased levels of P.R.A. and Catecholamines. 2. In the control group Urapidil was more effective than Propranolol in prevention of hypertension. 3-Urapidil considerably reduces the required amount of SNP. 4.

Norris*, Departments of Anaesthesia, Universities of TGbingen (FRG) and Leeds*(UK) Sodiumnitroprusside (SNP) may be regarded as drug of choice to electively induce arterial hypotension, especially when very low levels of systemic blood pressure (NABP) are desirable. However recent animal studies have indicated a progressive development of cerebral e.c.f, acidosis during administration of the drug even when normal CBF values are maintained and the critical dosage of SNP is not exceeded. In order to elucidate whether this acidosis is due to cerebral cyanide intoxication, we tried to prevent development of e.c.f. acidosis by simultaneous administration of thiosulphate in 8 cats out of J9 animals subjected to controlled hypotension with SNP. E.C.F. pH was measured continuously with pH microelectrodes implanted in the cerebral cortex of the animals. In both groups of animals MABP was lowered to 30 mmHg for 30 minutes, followed by a period of 15 minutes with 28 mmHg. The results indicate that atSNP dosage of <dmg/kg severe e.c.f, acidosis develops directly a~erthe onset of SNP administration which can be prevented completely by thiosulphate treatment. In the thiosulphate group development of e.c.f, acidosis did not start before NABP was lowered to 50 mmHg. We conclude that during SNP administration to electively induce arterial hypotension the simultaneous administration of thiosulphate is necessary to prevent cerebral lactacidosis, even when the\"critical\"SNP dosage is not exceeded.",

Seventeen tracheotomized patients were studied in order to examine the relationship between cro-pharyngeal flora and broncho-pulmonary secondary infections. All the patients were mechanically ventilated for reasons other than pulmonary infection. Buccal, pharyngeal and bronchial samples were collected within 24 hours of tracheotomy.Durlng the study-period 9 patients developed secondary pneumonia as defined by clinical, biological and radiological criteria. The results show: I) a colonisation of the buccopharyngeal cavity with a high prevalence of negative gram bacilli 2) an early tracheo-bronchlal colonisation by at least one the oro-pharyngeal germs in 16 out oE 17 patients. 3) that the germ held responsible for the superinfection in the 9 cases of secondary pneumonia was always present in the initial buccopharyngeal samples (Proteus:3; Klebsiella: 2; E. coli: 1; pseudomonas Aer.: 1; enterobacter: 1, Serratia: I ).

This study was performed to evaluate the value of early bacteriological diagnosis snd adequate anti biotherapy CAB)on the prognosis. Patients and methods. Eighteen patients with extensive gan grene were studied (12 men 6 women). Mean age was 57 years (24-82). Eleven patients had signs of systemic toxicity ; mecehanieal ventilation was required in l] patients. Anuric renal failure observed in i patient wss treated with hemodislysis. According to the location of gangrene, patients were divided in 4 groups : perineal (8), abdominal wall (2), limb (6), neck (2) eellulitis. Results. Eleven of 18 patients had been treated before ad mission with penieilline G ossoeiated with imidazole deri vate (n=9) and amimosides (n=6). Four patients developped eellulitis despite treatment withampicillin. Bacteriolo gieal examinations on admission was negative in 5 patients; only gram negative stains (GN5) were isolated in patients having sntianaerobic prophylaxis (n=4) ;GNS were associated with different types of streptococci (n=6). Shaphyloco eci were observed in association with different types of streptococci (n=5), GNS in=l) ; in one patient, D.Strept. was associated to El. perfingens. Specific antibiotics according to bacteriological results stopped gangrene ex tension in all patients. Four patients died ; the death was related to the septic shock in two patients and to other cause in two patients. Conclusions. Early identification of microbial sgents involved zn synergistic-bacterial gangrene has likely played a msjor role in the management of these severe infections. Specific antibiotherapy associated with surge ry may improve significantly the prognosis of these infec tioms.

In developing countries tetanus is still a real problem in respect to both occurence and mortality rate. In all countries with high medical standard it has become an uncommon disease. In our own hospital the number of tetanus cases per year has decreased from iO -12 in the sixties to 2 -3 in the last three years. Because of this relative rarity, very few clinicians see more than an occasional case. The diagnosis is therefore often missed or recognized quite late as it is still based on clinical observation only. Till now no laboratory or other test is accepted, although various suggestions have been made. The problem of diagnosis is further complicated because cases of pseudotetanus are occasionally seen. Since 1978 we have taken EMGs in all patients who were suspect for tetanus but whose case history or clinical symptoms left some doubt. In 6 cases the EMGs were typical for tetanus with a shortening or absence of the silent period after a stretch reflex or after supramaximal stimulation and with a continuous activity of motor units which could not be influenced voluntarily. In two patients we found a normal EMG. In all 8 cases the acuracy of the electromyographic diagnosis of tetanus was confirmed by the further development of the disease. Therefore we think that Electromyography is a very useful and reliable tool either to confirm or to rule out the diagnosis of tetanus. Immunodeficiency has proved to play an important role in the outcome of critical patients. The present communication will investigate, in a prospective manner, the sensitivity and precocity of the different parameters measuring the immunological competence, as well as its changes as an indez of septic risk. Nineteen patients were studied. All of them were seriously traumatized ( multiple trauma or head injury ). Within the first 24 hours, they were submitted to the following: Skin testing (ST), T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, total lymphocyte count, and total hemolytic complement (CH50). In a sub-group of seven patients, the same study was repeated a week later. The results showed that T-rosettes was an useful method for prediction on septic risk (p 0,05) as ST were, but with more promptness and statistic significance ( p 0,01 versus 0,05 ). CH50, B lymphocytes and total l~aphocyte count were not specific as an index of evolution nor of septic death or complications. As a conslusion, the determination of T-rosettes has proved to be, in this group of patients, a valuable test, higher than ST, as a prognosis of septic complica~i6ns and as a rapid checking of im/nuno-competence state associated to high risk.",

Alcohol intoxication increased significantly in 1981 (p<0,01) wheras clinically treated hypnotic drug intoxications decreased. Severety of intoxication was judged by 7 parameters: loss of consciousness, loss of pain reaction, circulatory arrest and/or respiratory failure, areflexia, arterial hypotension SAP< 90 mm Hg, hyperglycemia> 200 mg/dl, artificial respiration. 2 or more of theses parameters were present in 27 (1971) and 33 (1981) pat. and the number of pat. with more than 3 parameters increased significantly. Of the most severe intoxications 9/Z7 (1971) resp. 15/33 (1981) were due to barbiturates. In 1971 39% of pat. were treated in the ICU, in 1981 only 15% (p<0,01). There was no significant difference in frequence of unconsciousness, loss of pain reaction, areflexia, light reaction of pupils, arterial hypotension and hypothermia, but pat. with heart rate<80/min, circulatory arrest, respiratory failure, artificial respiration were more frequent in 1981 (p< 0,01). Gastric lavage was performed in 80% in both periods, forced diureses decreased from 48% (1971) to 13% (1981) (p<O,01). Extracorporeal hemodialysis and hemoperfusion was performed in 11 pat. in 1981. Globale mortality was less than I%, mortality in the ICU was 2% (1971) resp. 6% (1981) (n.s.). The mean duration of stay in the ICU increased from 2.2+ 3.1 (1971) to 5.5 + 8.1 days (1981) (p<0,01). Conclusions:The population of clinically treated pat. with acut poisoning varied in resp. to an increased rate of alcohol intoxication and of very severe intoxications with cardio-respiratory-metabolic failure with a high rate of barbiturates, a decrease of forced diureses, mal nde~a st~o gerunc~ange~.el ec ion of pat. for the ICU. Adrenocortical hypofunction is not uncommon in critically ill patients and daily serum cortisol measurements may have prognostic importance. 1 In a previous study of 132 patients 34 who had oortisol levels remaining <350 nmol/l all died. This report refers to a trial of replacement therapy in cortisol deficient patients. Using a radioimmuno assay [Corning], daily 08.00h serum cortisol measurements were made on 70 consecutive patients, who were allocated randomly to one of 2 groups. 18 [25.7%] patients had cortisol values below the critical level of 350 nmol/l. I 12 of these had l-hour adrenal stimulation tests using synthetic aorticotrophin. All tests were negative, All patients received treatment appropriate to their conditions but additionally patients in group 2 received hydrocortisone replacement while group 1 acted ms controls. Tauroline is applied intravenously as a chemotherapeutic in infections and septic cases. A hypothetic interaction of injected tauroline on the hypertensive effect of dopamine or dobutamine was tested in hypovolemic rats and compared with an injection of saline instead of taurolidine. The blood pressure was lowered in WISTARrats by reducing the blood volume by Iml within 1 minute. The blood pressure was continuously measured with a Statham blood pressure transducer connected to a cannula in the carotid artery and recorded on a Beckman Dyonograph. 4 rats received 3 minutes after th~ artificial blood pressure decrease 0,6 x I0 mol dopamine, followed by an infusion of 2 ml Taurolin ~ NaCl or 2 ml saline within 7 minutes. 4 rats received an infusion of 0,6 x I0 ~mol and 2 ml Taurolin 2% or saline simultaneously. These procedures were repeated several times with the same rats. In all experiments, there was no significant difference in the sympathomimetic effect of dopamine. 2 hypovolemic rats reveived 0,7 xlO -6 mol dobutamine, followed by 2 ml Taurolin NaCI or sal!~e.",

It is specially indicated in the treatment of peritonitis and septic shock. In vitro, it reacts with Dopamine to inactivate it. It has been recommended that the two drugs should be used alternately in two hour cycles. This sequence is not appropriate in the clinical care situation.

The administration of exogenous fibronectin ge_a red to avoid some complications in critically ill traumatic patients (sepsis, ARDS) relates to the important role played by this glycoprorein in the inespecific opsonization of the reticuloendothelial system. The change in the PPL in these patients and its dependence on the severity of the trauma were investigated, The PPL was measured by inm~unoelectrophoresis in 29 patients with multiple injuries and they were related to an injury severity score (ISS). The m~ an value for the FPL was %8,6 ~ 18% as compared to the 98,% ~ 2056% of the control group of healthy human beings (p O,OO1). There was no statistical significance in the correlation between the FPL and the ISS in all the patients studied. Patients with only head trauma (with an ISS = 25,% ~ 0,3) however had a higher FPL (68,5 + 20%) than the rest of patients with multiple injuries (ISS = 35,3 J iO and FPL = 54,8 ~ 16%). These results demostrate that the FPL is reduced in patients with multiple injuries. This l~ vel, however, is better correlated with the volume of tissue involved than with the possible injury of vital organs (head trauma). This is to be taken into account when facing a possible th~ rapeutic infusion of this protein.

Based on a two years experience, and on a population of 570 patients, correlating severity scores to clinical evolution can allow an early theoritical prognosis approach of the multitramatized patient survival.

Though ARDS following sepsis, trauma or coagulation disturbances is well known, the same does not hold true for centally-initiated impaired pulmonary gas-exchange or neurogenic ARDS, respectively. Therefore, in a prospective clinical study in 129 patients with isolated head injury frequency of ARDS, its relation to severity of cerebral trauma and its relevance to clinical outcome were examined. Severity of head injury was graded by meansof the Glasgow-Coma-Scale (GCS)and pulmonary gas-exchange was expressed by the quotient A-aDOp/PAO p (Q). Patients with additional trauma suc~ as Nemorrhagic shock, fractures of the large bones, direct ehesm-mrauma or aspiration were excluded. Our results demonstrate a relationship between the severity of head injury and impaired pulmonary gas-exchange. 22.5 % of all patients suffer from a severe neurogenic ARDS(Q> 0.6) while in additional 26.3 % pulmonary gas-exchange was moderately impaired (Q>O.L<0.6). With increasing severity of neuro-~ enic ARDS survival rate decreased from 58.3% severe head injury but without ARDS) and 55.3% (severe head injury with a moderate degree of ARDS) down to 24.1 % (severe head injury with severe ARDS) despite an increase of ~ontrolled ventilation from 66.6 to 89.1 %. Moreover, neuro logical outcome is significantly worse in the latter group than in the former ones. Alveolo-cap ilIar ductance for carbon monoxyde (defined by a mathematical expression [(Pl -PA)/PI ] identical to efficient alveolar ventilation) represents the pulmonary blood volume close to ventilated alveolar space. With an original informatic method, i t ' s measurment in s ready s tare cohditions can be performed at bed s [de and in mechanicaly ventilated patients. Aprospective study has been conducted in order to assess the diagnostic and pronostic value of DuACCO in pulmonary embolism. This day 12 patients were entered in the study. On the first day following the admission in the intensive care unit, blood gases and DuACCO were measured and a pulmonary angiography was performed. A long term follow up was obtained by repeated measurments of DuACCO. On day i, DuACCO reached a mean of O.43 (i.e. 61% of the theoreti cal value) with a minimum of O. 24 and a maximum of O. 60, PaO 2 reached a mean o f 53 mmHg with a minimum of 35 mmHg and a maximum of 70 mmHg. The pulmonary hypoperfusion degree, as it can be evaluated on pulmonary angzograms according to WALSH index, reached amean of lOwith a minimumof 2 and amaximumof 15. A closed correlation is observed between Walsh Index and DuACCO (r = -O. 78, p <0.O1). In one case of massive pulmonary embolism (Walsh index = 20) with slight hypoxemia (PaO2 = 62 mmEg) DuACCO remained dramatically lowered (DuACCO = 37, i.e. 53 % of the theoretical value). On day 40, DuACCO reached s mean of 0.59 (i.e. 84 % of the theoret ical value) in 6 patients despite the lack of thrombolytic the rapy. We conclude that DuACCO zs a non invasive reliable measurment allowing severity evaluation and longterm follow up of pulmonary embolism. The experiments were performed. ~n 10 pigs (5 for contro~ and 5 animals received 1,5 mg of escherichia coli endoto ~ xin). The animals were tracheotomised and anesthetized with Halothane (0,5%).the cardiac output (C.O) was measured by thermodilution. The distribution of C.O was measured by injection nuclide labeled radioactive microspheres (15#m in diameter)(New England nuclear) into the left ventricule. Particles were injected before (57 Co) and at 5 (113 Sn) and 60 mn (46 Sc) after administration of end~ toxin. After the pigs were killed, 50 samples of the organs were dissected, weighed and counted in a gamma scintillation counter. The 15#m microspheres measured only the ca~illary blood flow (nutrient blood flow).

Before and after CPAP, FRC was measured by multiple breath nitrogen washout. During CPAP, changes in FRC and respiratory pattern were continuously monitored with pre-calibrated bellows pneumographs. Results : The increase in FRC (+ 22% of control level) ~d under CPAP varied with time (range: + II% to + 41% of control level) and disappeared within the first minute after discontinuation of CPAP. Tidal volume increased significantly during CPAP while minute ventilation remained stable. Conclusions : In patients with normal lungs, the effect of CPAP on FRC ends with the removal of the positive pressure. The mean increase in FRC observed with bellows pneumographs during I0 cm HpO CPAP is similar to the one measured with the helium di?ution method (I) but varies greatly breath by breath and thus may give additional information to the results of former studies where only intermittent measurements of FRC were performed.",

Peep is produced by preloading these valves, which permits gas flow only from a set opening pressure. Once the opening pressure is overcome, ideally gas flow should occur unobstructed. No gas flow is possible in the opposite direction. There are many techniques to produce Peep, they involve water columns, springs, magnens, coun~erpressure, balls, etc..; but one feature common to all currently used valves is their unidirectional function. We present a bidirectional Peep valve which not only exerts Peep in one direction, but also permits unobstructed flow in the opposite direction. The Peep ranges between 3 and 20mbar. Its resistance is 0.8 mbar at a gas flow of 0.5 L/sec and 2.45 mbar at 1 L/sec respectively. Two porns allow suctionning and airway pressure measurements.",

HFJV offers a new and improved technique for patients with ARF in the postoperative period. We investigated whether and under which circumstances suppression of spontaneous breathing occurs during high frequency ventilation. Yorkshire piglets were ventilated with a high frequency jet ventilator under pentobarbital anaesthesia. The highest PaCO^ at which the animals z did not breath against the ventllator (Pacopapnea) was established during different patZerns of ventilation. Where necessary for compensation of hyperventilation this was done by adding CO 2 to the respiratory gases. Arterial oxygen tension was kept above i00 mmHg. Suppression of spontaneous breathing activity could be obtained during ventilation with higher frequencies, irrespective the tidal volume and the insufflatory flow velocity. So, the mode of dynamic activation of the stretch receptors was rejected as a causal mechanism. Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), increasing with higher frequencies, suppressed the spontaneous breathing activity, also at a constant ventilatory rate. However, a hysteresis effect in the relation PaCo~-apnea versus PEEP was found, which z suggests that the s~ppression of spontaneous breathing duringhigh frequency ventilation depends on the end expiratory volume rather than the end expiratory pressure.",

Alveolar carbon dioxide tension is in balance with the pulmonary capillary and arterial blood carbon dioxide tension. Thus, end-tidal carbon dioxide tension (PETCO~) can offer useful information concerning the adequacy ofventilation. In order to find out the correlation between PETC02 and the arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaC02), linear reqression analysis was performed between 250 values of PETCO 2 and simultaneously obtained P.CO 2 values. The PETC02 was determined usine an infrared carbon dioxide analyser (Datex Normocap). The correlation was found good in patients on controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) after open-heart surgery. The correlation coefficient (r) was 0.858 for a volumecycled ventilator (Servo 900B; n=176) and the r was 0.722 for a ventilator using a continuous fresh gas flow via the T-piece (IMV Bird; n=29). The gas samples were obtained from a sampling adapter interposed between the intubation tube and the T-piece. Thus, with the sampling method used, fresh gas flow Via the T-piece may mix with the respiratory gases and affect the reliability of PETCO 2 monitoring. In another series of samples, obtained from patients on CMV using the Servo 900B ventilators, the r was 0.898 for samples drawn directly from the intubation tube at the mouth level (n=26), while the r was 0.792 for samples drawn from the aforementioned adapter (n=19). Both samples correlate well with the PaC02, but it may be concluded that for best precision it is advantageous to draw the expiratory gas sample directly from the intubation tube.",

On the contrary~P(a-ET)CO 2 in COLD patients, i8 increased whatever be the co~se of the ARE. Then the difference i8 linked with the ventilation/perfusion ratio mismatching and i8 due to both alveolar mixing defect (ventilatory mechanism) and dead space effect (circulatory mechanism). We speculate that the ventilatory part of the difference could be cancelled by forced expiration. 18 COLD patients with suspicious PE support our study. Pulmonary angiography and PEMCO 2 are performed the 8~e day. PEMCO 2 is calculated by continuous recording of forced ezpired CO 2 and simultaneous determination of PaCO 2. AP(a-PEM)CO 2 is then computed, and also the ratio D = ~P(a-PEM)CO2/PEMCO 2. Diazepam is among the most widely used drugs forthesedation of ventilated patients. However, it does not appear to be generally recognised that this kind of treatment might be responsible for a prolonged depression of the central nervous system and therefore a delay in extubationfor many days. Analysing two cases with massive accumulation of Diazepam and persistent coma the problem of Benzodiazepine-intoxication during sedation of ventilated patients is demonstrated on the basis of measured plasmaconcentrations and the diagnostic and therapeutic use of a new Benzodiazepine-antagonist (Ro 15-1788): i. a previously healthy 70 year old female with respiratory insufficiency following pulmonary embolism remained comatous during 12 days following administration of a total dose of 260 mg Diazep~m withinthefirst 3 days. Plaemaconcentrations of Diazepam and Desmethyldiazepam were 437 and 483 ng/ml, 150 hours after the last medication; the calculated elimination-halflifes of the two substances were 109 and 403 hours. 2. a 63 year old man with preexisting liver disease had to be ventilated because of severe bacterial pneumonia; following sedation during 16 days with a total dose of 245 mg Diazepam he remained cc~atous for additional 6 days. The semiquantitative urinary test for Diazepam was still positive i0 days after discontinuation of the drug. In both cases the Diazepam-induced depression of the central nervous system could be demonstrated and reversed under EEG-controlled conditions by the new Benzodiazepine-antagonist Ro 15-1788. We conclude that Diazepam is not an appropriate drug for long-term sedation because of its pharmacokinetic characteristics; the new Benzodiazepine-antagonist Ro 15-1788 seems to be a valuable tool in the diagnostic and therapeutic management of Benzodiazepine-intoxications. An increase of C5a measured by in vitro aggregation of polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMN) has been detected in plasma of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by Hammerschmidt et al (Lancet, 1980, I, 947-949) . To assess this phenomenon C5a activity was measured by chemiluminescence (CL) in control AB serum before (CS) and after zymosan activation (CSA) and in serum of patients with acute respiratory failure : ARDS, cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CPE), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Patients with COLD undergoing acute exacerbations are often malnourished and may require TPN during the initial phase of artifical ventilation. In this study energy expenditure was examined in 6 patients. Energy expenditure (EE)was measured by indirect calorimetry using a new device connected to a respirator. A 0 -microfuelcell takes alternate sampies from t~e inspirator} and exspiratory gases and the difference in oxygen concentrations is multiplied by the ventilatory flow-rate. Measurements were started 24 hours or earlier after initation of controlled mechanical ventilation. EE was continuosly monitored for 2 to 5 days. Measured values were compared to predicted values which were achieved by using Harris-Benedicts formula for BMR and adding 13~ of BMR For each centigrade elevation of body temperature above normal. Furthermore 10% was added because of the so called specific dynamic action of foodstuffs. The patients received TPN including fatemulsion and energy intake was between 19 and 30 keal/kg/24 hours and never exceeded measured EE. Measured EE was between 21 and 37 kca1/Kg/24 hours (mean: 29, 8, SD4, 8) . Measured values of EE were -5~ -+55~ above the predicted values (mean 25,3% SD 18,5}. The reason for this hypermetabolism observed in all patients except one could be the energy cost of filling up energy stores which had been depleted prior to parenteral nutrition. It is difficult to predict the great variations in EE so continual measurements should be made in order to adjust energy intake to requirements.",

I00 pts (9-82 years,mean 50.7), admitted to ICUfor 3days at least because of different ailments, were sorted in 4 groups (A-D) according to the aggregate score of ISS (IS),growing from A roD, during their stay in ICU (15.5 ~9.3 days). The mean infection rate was 60%: 18.5% in group A, 100% in D. Significative correlation was found between IS and number of infectious episodes per patient (ni/p)(p<O.O01! and between ni/p and during of stay (p<O.O02). Infectionrateresulted more significantly related to IS (p<O.Ol) than to during of stay(p<O.O5).No significative correlation was found between infection rate and patient!s age and between infection rate and immunodeficiencyfrom corticosteroid therapy. A moderate invasiveness have not a predominant roll for infection's rise in comparison to the during of stay, the immunodeficiency and the age; it is dangerous when it gets over a medium level; then, it seems to increase any other risk factor. The ISS proved to be usefull for studying comparatively heterogeneous pts and it could have a clinical application, if calculated at the beginning of the stay in ICU, in order to identificate pts with high risk of procedure-related infection. ~Geraci P. etal., Atti 34~ 1982; in press.

After the reconstruction project including installation of an air-conditioning system with highperformance filters and strict structural and organizational separation of the unit from other parts of the hospital had beed completed, the daily microbiological surveillance was continued for two years and provided data from 50o patients. A comparison of frequency, species distribution and clinical significance of the microbes obtained from the unit which was run all the time with the same personnel, before and after reconstruction revealed the specific problems associated with a strictly isolated ward. In addition, the changes observed in the spectrum of the nosocomial bacteria, their antibiotic susceptibility patterns and their clinical significance could be used to evaluate the therapeutic measures employed and to establish more appropriate therapeutic schemes if necessary.",

Beside the well ~own high mortality rate associated with pulmonary infection in ICU pts, this study emphasizes the high incidence of early onset pneumonias. LEGIONEILA INFECTION IN AN INTENSIVE CARE UNIT FROM 1977 TO 1952 Hospital the University of Nottingham, England. Iegionaires disease first appeared in an identifiable form in the Nottingham area in 1977. Initially identification of the disease was difficult and early blood specimens had to be sent to the National Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, for identification of antibodies. This did not help early diagnosis| even when immunological identification became available locally the delay of fourteen days for a significant antibody response precluded the rapid recognition of the disease by that means. Fortunately distinctive radiological, biochemical and haematological changes came to be reeognised. Patients could therefore be treated early on the basis of these findings alone with Erythromycin, which appears to be almost the only available effective antibiotic which is effective in this disease, Almost all the patients referred to the intensive care unit required prolonged lung ventilation with (at times) very high levels of inspired oxygen. Intravenous nutrition was often required for long periods although naso gastric feeding was preferred when ever this was possible. Renal failure, when it occurred required dialysis. A review of the incidence of pneumonia cases since 1973 suggests that there is now a cyclical legionalla factor occurring every two years in those patients requiring mechanical respiratory support. The STAF ~ isolated in blood may be dismissed as contaminants. However, STAF-septicaemlas (SEPT) are well recognized in patients with intravascular fore[ng bodies (cardiac prostheses, ventricular-atrial shunts, vascular grafts) Intravascular catheters (VASCATH) are very commonly used in critically ill patients and they may favour the prese~ ce of STAF-SEPT. in them CRITERIA to diagnose a STAF-SEPT in this study were: I/ clinical septic condition, 2/ isolation of STAF-in at least two blood culture bottles and 3/ presen ce of VASCATH whether or not the STAF -was isolated fro~tem. RESULTS.-Among the 1141 admissions to our ICU, 504 had blood cultures taken and they were positive in 210 patients (15% incidence). In 44 (9% of all blood cultures) STAF-was isolated. However, in 32 (73%) was considered as contaminant and only in 12 (27%) as pathogenic for the above criteria were met. The STAF -was iso]ated in 4 patients in the course of a \"multip]e species septicaemia '= and in 8 was the only organism isolated (mean of 3.6 bott]es). One patient with endocarditis in a valvular prostesis was excluded. Hence in 7 patients the STAF-was thought to be the responsible of a \" primary STAF-SEPT\". Their mean age was 68.3 years (range 51-73 years). All patients had VASCATH (mean 1.9/per patient) with a mean duration of catheterization (n=6) of 7.2 days (range 2-15 days). In 5 STAF-was cultivated from the catheter's tip. One patient developped shock during the SEPT. CONCLUSIONS STAF-appears frequently in blood samples, but usually represents a contamination. However, the repetitive isolation of STAF-in blood samples in patients with VASCATH must be considered as a relevant finding concerning the posibility of a STAF -SEPT. According to literature,mortality of patients suffering from AGP is higher than 50% (in some cases,higher than 90%).In 115 patients (68 primary AGP,47 secondary AGP) oh= served over 20 months,admitted in ICU for a stay over 5 days,were investigated some factors of probable prognostic meaning: pathogenesis (primary, seeondary),source of in= fection (supra-or infra-mesocolic), interval between eli= nical onset and operation, interval between operation and admittance in ICU, stay in ICU, percentage of complica= tione. Total mortality was 40.9% (39.7'% in primary AGP, 42.6% in secondary AGP), while mortality in infra-mesoco= lic AGP was significantly lower. The interval between ope= ration and admittance in ICU was nearly the some in the patients who recovered (1.0+2.6 days) and in those who died (0.6+1.4 days).The interval between clinical onset and operation was remarkably longer for the patients who died. In this last group, the percentage of complications was significantly higher too. According to literature, the investigation confirmed a higher mortality in secondary AGP, a clear connection between operation delay, compliea= tions percentage and mortality. In opposition to literatu= re, it showed a mortality significantly higher in the su= pra-mesocolic versus infra-mesocolic peritonitis. The low total mortality percentage is probably due to the early admission to ICU, immediately after the operation, 3oefore the onset of haemodynamic, respiratory and~or renal com= plications 2",

The incidence of 4320 measurements frcm the GCIIS during a 24-hour control period is the main reascn for developing this method, which permits a ccmfortable handling of a vast number of data. The procedure is based on a BASIC ccrnputer pr6grar~ne,that will be demcnstrate~. /mFatmode: An interface between the GCIIS and the microccmputer PC 800 (MAGIRUS [I~TKNTEC~IK) has been employed to transfer all data directly at one minute intervals. Further, comments concerning actual therapy can be inserted manually. Calculations:The following parameters,characterizing the state of carbohydrate metabolism, may be calculated: -MBG = mean blood glucose -M-value = a measure for the duration and the degree of pathological blood glucose levels (I) -MAGE = mean anplitude of glycemic excursions (2) -an index, indicating the sensitivity to insulin. Record:Blood glucose, insulin rate and dextrose rate are plotted continuously. CcGments will be printed, too. Documentation: All recorded data are stored on a 5 inch floppy disk.

Spirometry was made by means of the \"POOL\" apparatus (USER). Gas composition of theblood and acid-base balance were determined by using the equipment of the \"Radiometer\" Company (Denmark). Disturbance of cerebral control of breathing occurs in lesions of the corticospinal and corticonuclear connexions: a) Unilateral destruction of these systems in the right hemisphere causes the syndrome of partial loss of cerebral control. Spirometry indicated restrictive forth of respiratory insufficiency, b) Bilateral destruction of the corticonuclear and corticobulbar connexions in the brain stem leads to complete loss of cerebral control and consequently of voluntary breathing and cough. Automatic control provides gas exchange under condition of free airways (tracheostomy, suction from the tracheobronchial tree). Respiratory insufficiency was referred to obstructive type. Diseases of peripheral neuron (paralysis of respiratory muscles and bulbar palsy) are followed by respiratory insufficiency of restrictive-obstructive type. Restoration of pulmonary functions occurs within 8 to 12 months from the development of paralyses in acute polyradiculoneuritis. In severe form of myasthenia gTavis this type of respiratory insufficiency has been observed for many years.",

J.Tahvanainen, M.Hallman, P.Nikki, Department of Anaesthesia, Helsinki University Central Hospital, and Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki, SF-00290 Helsinki 29, Finland Normal lung surfactant contains prominent phosphatidylglycerol (PG), or phosphatidylinositol (PI), but only trace of phosphatidylserine (PS). These phospholipids were investigated in lung effluent from 14 adult patients with acute respiratory failure. 31 samples were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage using a 70 cm silicone catheter. PG, PI and PS were measured as percentages of total phospholipids in lavage return. Prior to sampling pulmonary venous admixture (Qs/Qt) and lung thoracic compliance (CLT) were measured. CLT correlated significantly with PG (r=0.61, p<.001)and PS (r=-0.62, p<.O01), but not with PI. No correlation between any of the phospholipids and Qs/Qt was found. Patients who died of respiratory failure (n=8) had higher PS than those who survived (n=8), i.e. 8.4 \u2022 1.2% vs 3.8 \u2022 1.1% (p<.05). CLT was 30 + 3ml/cm H20 in the former group and 46 ! 8 ml/cm H^O in the latter one (p<.O5). PG, PI or ~s/Qt v~lues did not differ significantly between these two groups. Our data suggest that deficient surfactant phospholipids are at least partly responsible of reduced lung elasticity in acute respiratory failure of the adult. Furthermore, a patient with deteriorated lung nechanics and a prominent PS has poor prognosis.",

The term \"preload\" usually denotes the force that must be supported by the ventricles of the heart at the end of the diastolic phase: the maximum of diastolic filling pressure, volume an muscle fiber tension ( as given by Laplace relation) is reached; rising ventricular pressure crosses atrial pressure, atrioventricular valve closes. In contrast to this the d~amic point of view leads to quite different conclusions. The prupose of the present investigation is to describe the dynamic relationship between pressure and flow across the mitral valve. Due to inertia of mitral blood flow, valve clnsure is delayed for a certain time after the atrioventricular pres, sure crossover. This delay has been investigated by means of dLmensional analysis. A nondimensional number occurring in this analysis has been \"taken from the report of an experiment with dogs and then used to determine the conditions of mitral valve closure ( i.e. the magnitude of dynamic preload) in man. Results: rat/ler high (&p 80 Torr) pressure are obtained during e~ercise( heart rate 172/ rnin. ) and about 10% of the stroke volume enters the ventricle and increases its volt~L~ before the mitral valve closes. The theoretical prediction is 'then verified by echocardiography of the isovolumetric peried(IP).Mitral valve closure and aortic valve opening are picked up simultaneously with two echeoardiographic apparatus. Thus IP can be measured directly.Result: IP decreases at a rate greater than that of the increase in heart rate resulting from exercise and even disappears altogether when the heart rate reaches a sufficiently high level (140/min.). It is possible for the dynamic preload to overlap with the beginning of the afterload period, as indicated by aortic valve opening. Controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV), intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) and spontaneous breathing with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) were compared in 9 patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by respiratory failure. Cardiopulmonary function was assessed by measuring thermodilution cardiac output, circulatory pressures, blood gases and the sum of the ST-segment deviations in a 12-lead ECG (AZST).",

Within a period of one year, in our intensive care unit five patients developed \"torsades de pointes\" (TP) with production of syncopes. In all patients E.C.G. revealed QT prolongation longer than 0,55 see and mild bradycardia just before the onset of TP ; at the same time, in three patignts a markedly hypokaliemia (<3 meq/l) was noted, but in two others, kaliemia was normal (4,6 and 4,7 meq/l).

In the two normokaliemic patients kaliemia and kaliuresis were without appreciable change, QT returned to normal within three and four days, and under daily potassiu m supplements, none episode of TP occured later without any other treatment.

Pressure waves are applied in the 4th intercostal space, using a 2.5 cm diameter thumper with variable rate and adjustable mechanical energy. With proper angulation and sufficient energy, electrical cardiac potentials are induced with subsequent contraction of the heart. In 8 patients with cardiac arrest we used this device during CPR. In 4 of these patients it was possible to obtain a sufficient circulatory function without cardiac massage until stable endocardial electrical pacing could be established. As could be expected, in cases of electromechanical dissociation no effective circulation was obtained. In these 4 patients no mechanical response followed the induced cardiac potentials. This was Confirmed by subsequent electrical stimulation. These preliminary results indicate, that external pacing with a mechanical pressure wave device may be useful in the emergency treatment of patients with cardiac arrest, whileendocardial pacing is accomplished.",

The prevention of blood pressure crises resulting from sudden changes in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and cardiac output (CO) signifies an advance in therapy with these substances. Methods: We have developed a computer the size of a standard clinical monitor, which , as part of a control system, safely doses vasoactive substances. The advantages of this system (monitor, computer and metering pump) consist in its safety and variability. After input of the applied substance, the maximal dose and a code for the direction of the blood pressure change, the program functions automatically. Fixed limits (dose, blood pressure) are maintained; an alarm is set off when they are reached. In addition, important calculations (hemodynamic profile, pulmonary shunt volume and P50) can be made with a separate computer program (I) and a data logger. Conclusion: The computer stores the dose of the vasoactive substance, the changes in the hemodynamic parameters and the calculated parameters for further statistical evaluation. References: I. Th.

Sixteen pns required an operation ou emergency basis ~group A) because of signs of impending aortic rupture (12) oliguria (i), development of neurologic defict (2), failure co control hypertension (I). Twenty ~ts had uncomplicated dissection and the operation was performed after stabilization with medical treatment (group B). The overall mortality rate was 33% with i0 hospital deaths in group A (62%) and 2 in group B (10%). We performed 15 operations uszng femoro-femoral by-pass with 7 deaths (46%), 16 using Gott shunt with ~ deaths (25%), 4 using simple cross-cl~aping technique with I death (25%). Only in one patient we used successfully left atrial-femoral artery bypass. The main complications were spinal cord injury in 5 pus, renal insufficiency in 5, left ventricular failure in 4, hemorrhage in 3. We concluded that the cperauive survival race is significanr higher (p(O.05) in stabilized patients; tat spinal cord znjury is unpredictable and probably not related co perfusion techniques; renal failure seems to be related co low perfusion; the Gott procedure zs more satisfactory in providing proximal decompression The optimum treatment of DAA-surgical or solely medicalremains uncertain. Since there is little information about long term results this study persnes prognoeie of operative therapy of DAA over a 7-year period. ~ Since 1974, an unselected cohort of 32 patients had surgical therapy of DAA. All patients were followed up until July 1982, datas were analyzed retrospectively (76.8 pat.yrs,max.surv. 7.2 yrs) . 27 aneurysms were dissected (84%). There were 17 traumatic(S3%) andl3 arteriosclerotic (41%) DAA. In either 16 patients (50%) clinical course was acute or chronic. 30 patients had replacement of DAA by vascular graft, 2 had local correction. All but i patient were operated with ECC or temporary shunt. ~ Overall operative mortality (OM) was 37.5%, dn dissecting DAA 41% (ii/24). OM in traumatic DAA was 18% (3/17), 2/3 patients died in table due to acute rupture. OM in arteriosclerotic DAA was 54% (7/13). Postop. no patient had paraplegia; 4 patients (13%) required hemodialysis because of temporary renal failure, i patient with replacement of DAA died 3 months postop., all other patients were alive on control key date, 61% resuming their professional activities. We conclude that best operative results can be achieved in traumatic DAA . However, the high incidence of intraop. rupture in this group emphasizes the need of rapid diagnosis and surgery. Patients with arteriosclerotic DAA have the highest OM due to poor quality of aortic tissue and to the elevated morbidity of these patients. Although none of our patients suffered paraplegia the incidence of renal dysfunction underlines the importance of ECC or sufficient shunt. Late mortality after surgical therapy of DAA is low, patients generally resume normal private and professional activities.",

Nice Pr P.Maestracci ** Fondation organes articiels. Clinique de Genolier. Pr CH. Hahn -CH-*** Artificiel organ laboratory Brown university RI -USA -To compare the degree of metabolic protection afforded during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPBP) by the two most widely used techniques of anesthesia, 15 patients (14 mons and I women) undergoing elective coronary surgery (If) or cardiac valve replacement (4) had their blood glucose levels contineusly monitored by means of the Biostator glucose controller. The patients received no exogenous dextrose and no insuline from either the anesthesiologist or the priming fluid of the heart lung machine. Blood sa~oles for metabolic and endocrine determinations were obtained before induction of anesthesia, before CPBP, after 30 min of CPBP, at the end of CPBP and 50' after discontinuation of CPBP. Eight patients were operated under balane~ analgesia using enflurane, flunitrazep~n,fentanyl, pancuroniem and nitrous oxide, whereas 7 patients received narceneurolept analgesia using thiopenthal, droperidol, phenoperidine, pancuroniem and nitrous oxide. Starting from the same fasting blood glucose level as the balanced anesthesia group, the patients under narconeuroleptanalgesia exhibited a lower hyperglycemic response to non pulsatile CPBP with the same levels of circulation insulin.This was coupled with lower blood levels of cortisol, and highter levels of glucacon. The narconeureleptanalgesia group also showed significantly lower levels of alanine and 3 -hydroxybutyrate compared to the balanced analgesia group. Lactate, pyruvate, epinephrine, norepinephrine, growth hormone, free fatty acids, glycerol, triglycerides and cholesterol leve|s did not differ significantly between the two groups. NA, K, mg, Ca and P remanied within normal limits. These observations suggest that during narconeuroleptanalgesia, there is an increased glucose utilization by peripheral tissues, coupled with reduced proteolysis and glyconeogenesis as compared with balanced anesthesia. Lipolysis is not affected by the type of anesthesia used for cardiac surgery. The pulmonary lesion produced by ECC causes a decrease in FRC and in arterial oxygenation. In the iranediate postoperative period the addition of PEEP can reverse this effect. 64 patients (42male, 22 female, mean age 55 years) who had undergone CABG (n=4o) or valve replacement (n=24) were included in this study. Group I (n=34) were weaned with CPAP 7, group II (n=3o) were weaned with Q-insufflation. Weaning was started 9.25\u2022 hours after ending operation. The patients did not receive any narcotic or sedative, nor were they on any vasopressor agents. Blood gases and respiratory rate (RR) were documented and PAO2-PaO2/PAQ (AaD% quotient) was calculated in each of these 3 conditions: I. CMV, both groups PEEP7; 2. Intubated, spontaneous breathing PEEP 7 (group I), ZEEP (group II); 3. I hour after extubation, both groups ZEEP. Each patient had only I FiQ throughout the study. The data presented in the following Under circumstances of intermittent and continuous positive pressure ventilation (IPPV and CPPV) right ventricular output (Qrv) was measured by means of a flow probe on the pulmonary artery in pigs (closed chest) and analysed beat-to-beat. Calibration was done by means of the Fick's method for oxygen. Qrv decreased during insufflation and recovered during spontaneous expiration via an overshoot to an end expiratory plateau. This plateau was constant when the expiratory pause was lengthened and appeared to be dependent on the level of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP). The end expiratory flow was considered to be the baseline value for its changes during insuf[lation. The deficit of flow during insufflation was much larger than the expiratory overshoot. Thus, mean cardiac output was lower than end expiratory flow. Decrease of mean cardiac output by PEEP or hypovolemia increased the insufflatory deficit but did not increase the compensatory overshoot. We concluded that -an estimation of cardiac output during an end expiratory plateau phase overestimates mean cardiac output, which was confirmed with the thermodilution technique, -the overestimation is higher at lower values of mean cardiac output, -the end expiratory flow depends on PEEP and mean cardiac output on PEEP and superimposed insufflation. In an attempt to obtain quantitative blood flow informations from Doppler signals recorded in the ascending aorta, the mean Doppler shift frequency must be measured and the extraneous signal from vessel walls represents noise that needs to be recognized and eliminated. If multiple frequencies are present, especially if the signal/ noise ratio is low, zero crossing detectors introduce significant errors (LUNDT 1975) and spectral analysis is necessary to determine the amplitude of each frequency component and to calculate the average frequencies. Several approaches to this problem have been employed, utilizing parallel narrow band filters, or digital fast Fourier transform. We used a laboratory-built Walsh transform analog system to calculate spectral components. The spectrum is displayed in the usual \"sonagram\" format with frequency as ordinate, the time axis as abscissa, and spectral power as trace brightness. The directional ultrasonic Doppler is also available for digital data acquisition.",

The assumed prerequisite for blood substitutes with a high solubility for oxygen is that an arterial oxygen tension {PaO 2) of at least 300 mmHg and therefore a high inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO 2) is necessary for the adequate oxygen supply to the organism. This would seriously limit the application of such substances in clinical practice. In order to investigate the validity of this hypothesis, we measured myocardial oxygen tension (PmO~) using a multiwire surface electrode and myocardial microflow (mMF) by means of hydrogen clearance following hemodilution (HD) with Fluosol DA 20 % (F DA) at FiO 2 of 1.0, 0.5, and 0.3. Eight anesthetised (Fentanyl/Diazepam) and artificially ventilated dogs were thoracotomised and hemodiluted with Hydroxyethylstarch (HES) to hematocrit (hct) 14 % and then with F DA to hct 7 %. Fluorocrit (fct) was 10 %. Results: At FiO 2 1.0 (PaO 2 466 mmHg) , F DA led to a 70 % increase of mean PmO 2 as compared to HES-HD and mMF increased by 7 %.

At FiO 2 0.3 (PaOp 91 mmHg) there was no further change in mMF an~ PmO 2 de' creased below control values. In those dogs where hypoxic tissue areas were observed acute moycardial failure occured. Conclusion: under our conditions of dilution with Fluosol DA(hct 7,fct 10) myocardial oxygen supply was well maintained at FiO 2 0.5 provided that the coronary reserve was normal.

Following the administration of dopamine ( 3,5 -5,bAng/ks body weight ) a significant increase of portal blood flow (A 39 % ) is observable in all cases except one.

Care Medecine have reached a high level.However, less atention has been paid to the older patients.One of therea sons for this has been the negative relationship costs/benefits mentioned.We think that the problem must be dealt with. The retrospective analysis of patients admitted in our ICU in the last 22 years has shown that 440 were over 64 years, 273 of them men. The varied pathology that determined admissions is referred to.This is no intention of comparing results as it is difficult to establish groups corresponding either to different previous heath status or to the severity of acute illness on the day of admission. It was found that mortality among the patients over 64 years was 43,4%,being comparable in both sexes.Among the remaining 3.403 patients it was 28,9%,Dividing our sample of aged patients in groups taking into account the mortality we can see an increasing mortality:39,7% in the group 65 to 75 years (n=312),50% in the group 75 to 80 years (n=82) and 56,5% in the group >80 years (n=46).There is a significant difference in these mortalities (xZ=6,328 \u00a7 p<O,OOl).A more detailed analysis of the data reveals that the statistical significance is mainly due to the age group over 75 years.On the other hand, the longer the stay in the ICU the smaller the rate of mortality (p<O,OOl),as more than half of the patients died during the first 48 hours. The average time of hospitalisation in ICU was 18,1 days against iO,I days among all the other patients. This study does not cover the period after the discharge,because we are just questioning how acceptable and fair intensive care medecine can be in the group of ages over 64 years.~ think that the age, per se, must not be a criterium of exclusion even taking into consideration all sorts of costs. In our opinion the general criteria of investigation,teaching and admission must prevail in these patients. The support of a geriatric ward is assumed. In combination with 52 self designed items we evaluated the answer of 5o patients transferred recently from ICU to regular ward to the question: Are environmental situations as emerging under ICU-conditions comparable in terms of their stress producing power? The patients had to bring the various stress items in a sequence of increasing annoyance just one day after dismission from the intensive care unit. The most annoying factor for all patients, almost sex and diagn3sis independent, was the item lack of information and communication. The item noise and unrest caused by the daily routine and the nursing staff on the intensive care unit was quoted o~ the first place by patients more than 50 y~ars. Helplessness and physical impairment are the most annoying factors by the ventilated patients. The item dependence on technical devices (e.g. ventilators, dialyzer etc.) was surprisingly quoted low by our patients. In conclusion to those facts a human orientated intensive care medicine should be claimed. Further investigations concerning the psychical care and help should be done.",

The following mechanisms of neurotumoral impairment were observed : arterial hypoxemia, respiratory alkalosis, hypercatabolism resulted in activation of the system studied. An impairment of mechanisms of compensation hypoxia was noted : decrease of 2,3 DFG level in erythrocytes, progressive anemia while blood loos was absent. The use of catecholamine and glucocorticoid precursors did nor improve the treatment results. Methods of pharmacological protection of brain from hypoxia were used in a second group of patients with glucocorticoids and an early intensive therapy. The best resluts were obtained with combined administration of barbiturate and dosium hydroxybutyrate. High stability and adaptation of neurohumoral systems to stress and preservation of their reserves, were due to a decreased hypoxia (pa02 + 4,1 kPa), metabolism restoration in erythrocytes, mange of their composition and correlation of hemoglobin fractions.

Five hundred patients were selected in whom the EEG tracings were recorded upon admission and then repeated over successive periods. Five EEG patterns Were identified: borderline (41 cases) diphasic with sleep-like spindles (161 patients) diphasic (139), monophasic (109), and silent (50). Mortality was maximum (100%) in the flat EEG (brain death), very high (86%) in the mono= phasic pattern (deep coma with decerebration), decreased in both the diphasic (60%) and border line (51%) types, and minimal (13%) in the sleep-like pattern.

The central conduction time (latency between N14 and N20 -CCT) and the amplitude ratio (N20/NI4-AR) were close to normals in patients with supratentorial lesions and good outcome. CCT increased and AR decreased with the worsening of outcome. Asymmetries in SEP indicated moderate or severe disability outcome. Patients with absent SEP over one or both hemispheres died. In patients suffering from primary brain stem dysfunction, confirmed by a normal or slightly abnormal CT scan, prolonged CCT, asymmetric but also absent SEP were also found in patients with good outcome. AR was generally low in these cases. Early appearance of SEP or early recovery of initially distorted SEP and decrease of CCT in control examinations was a favourable prognostic sign.

Only patients were elected who survived the acute phase (3 days). The combined enteral and parenteral nutrition included 430 g mixed carbohydrates, 70 g fat, and 150 g amino acids per day. The nutritional assessment comprised the aminograms of serum and urine (24hour excretions), the serum concentrations of 5 proteins and 6 hormones as well as the nitrogen balance taking in account the reflux rates following tube feeding. The mortality passed through a maximum between day 6 and day 7 after accident. During this period about 85 % of all N died and the reflux rates reached the highest values (> 80 %!). In the case of N, many parameters showed a corresponding maximum, but I or 2 days earlier, for example nitrogen balance, serum urea, total concentration Of serum amino acids, GOT, GPT, and prolactin. Due to the high reflux rates we propose a TPN at least until 10 days after accident. We have no explanation for the mentioned maxima. 239 387 EXPERIMENTAL ACUTE HYPOXIA.

The most prominent features of this study were: a) positive water balance throughout inspite of a significant weight loss (which points to high fluid losses with perspiration), b) high osmolar excretion, due to high urea excretion with posttraumatic protein catabolism, c) antidiuresis throughout with urine osmolality around 600 mosm/l and high negative free-water-clearance {due to high osmolar clearance), d) cumulated sodium balance was negative and averaged -440 mmol/21 days, e) normal creatinine clearance (occasionally unusual high values), f) normal creatinine excretion. We conclude that patients after severe trauma generally have good renal function and tend to antidiuresis, high osmelar excretion and negative sodium balance.",

The depletion of sstecholsmin and sortisol secretion developed step like from barbiturate and atomidate to butyrots and procaine. We report one new case of acute water intoxication (AWl) induced by oxytocin (OXY) infusion during therapeutic abor tion , in a 30 year old primigravida at 20 weeks'gestation After intraamniotic injection ~f Pro~taglandins ~ this patient received 210 units (u) of OXY in 2,5 liters (I) of a 5 % Dextrose in water solution, auring a period of 15 hours (h) 30 minutes (mn)(infusion rate (IR) of about 226 mU/mn), and twice i00 mg IM of Pethidin. Whereas she had vomitings and headache, a grand mal seizure then a deep coma occured. Serum sodium level was 112 millimoles/l and serum osmelarity 259 milliOsmoles/l. With interruption of oxytocin and sodium administation, a marked diuresis occured, with positive free water clearance ; electrolytes nor malized within 48 hours and consciousness cleared within 4 days. She was discharged completely recovered. About this new case and 41 cases previously reported in litterature, circumstances of occurence of this uncommon entirely iatrogenic disease were treatment of incomplete abortion (13 cases), post partum hemorrhage (5), induction of labour (6) or abortion (18). Isolated or associated symptoms were neurologic. In 11 cases, alarm but disregarded signs were headache, nausea, vomiting, or mental confu sion. In 4 cases, no symptom was observed except oliguria which is a constant finding. No correlation was found between severity of clinical signs sodium serum level, total volume perfused, total dose of oxy and duration of treatment (p>0,05). OXY antidiuretic effect depends on its IR. Then concomitant fluid administration may induce an AWl, facilitated by physiologic water and salt retention in pregnancy, individual sensitivity, and morphinics. In 39 patients recovery was complete. In 3 patients, serious neu rologic sequels were reported. 2 maternal deaths occured . 2 newborns presented severe signs of AWl but rapidly recovered. So, such accidents must be prevented by clinical survey, survey of OXY IR, minim fluid and proportional salt intakes. For a sensitive and specific detection of blood we tested the chromium-51-activity in the gastric aspirate after having labelled the patients' erythrocytes with chromium-51. The dosis of the medications were adjusted to a gastric juice pH above 3. From the results with 86 patients we draw the following preliminary conclusions: I. With a sensitive and specific method for detection of blood in gastric juice temporary blood traces could be detected in 30-40 % of patients of group A and B; the detected amounts of blood showed no clinical relevance but were far above the physiological blood loss of the gastrointestinal tract. 2. Visible blood in gastric juice was discovered in 3 patients in group A and in 2 patients in group B so far, an event expected in no treatment patients in 15-50 %. 3. The blood loss in the stomach depends on pH; above a pH of 3 blood could hardly been found, below a pH of 3 the blood losses were much higher and were negatively related to the pH. 4. A guajac paper test is not an appropriate method to detect occult blood in gastric juice contaminated with magnesium-aluminium-hydroxide. Liver is responsible for biosynthesis and degradation of sialoglycoprotein such as~] acid-glycoprotein (o<] AGP) and ~ ] anuitrypsin (~ 1 AT). The plasma of normal subjects contains negligible amounts of asialoglycoprotein because of the ability of the normal liver to clear them almost instantaneously from the circulation. In hepatic diseases, the presence of serum desialylated material has already been evidenced, but in this study, the hepatic insufficiency was often associated with other organ failure (J. Marshall et al, J. Lab. Clin. Med., ]978, 92, 30-37). The actual cause of this desialylation is still not well known : isolated hepatocellular damage (HCD) or multi vi~ ceral failure.",

In conclusion treatment of prolonged and severe shunt infections by external ventricular drainage of long duration and specific antimicrobial therapy may offer improvement in most of the cases.

Statistical comparison gives : for 1 vsa, I VS3, 2 VS3, 3 VS4 : p ~ 0.01 ; but for I VS4 ;IS. Plasma fibronectin levels decrease as early as the 6th hour ; the 7th day PF levels are nearly returned to the baseline rate. Thus, cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass may induce a drop of PF level. It is possible that fibronectin might lower resistance to sepsis which is a dreaded complication of this surgery. 420 oatients (nremature : 3 %; age~l month : 6 %; 1 to 24 months : 31%; 2 to 6 y.o.: 38 %; 6 y.o.: 22 %) submitted congenital corrective cardiac surgery were studied. Car-dio~ulmonary bYbaSS was used in 82 %. Weights were measured before and after surgery. 125 oatients have lost weight during the procedure, average:l.66 % + 1.58 295 natients have increased their initial BW~ average : 1.84 % + 2.02. Five subgroups were used for statistical analysis : Grou~ 1 : loss> 2 % BW qrouo II: loss 0-2 % BW qroun Ill:gain 1% BW Groun IV: gain I-2 % BW qroun V : gain~ 2 % BW The nostsurgical comnlications : cardiac failure, arrythmias, atelectasis, oleural effusion, and the nostsurgical ventilatory weaning delay were statistically analysed in these 5 grouDs. The number of postsurgical comnlications was increased in correlation with the BW gain during the surgical nrocedure. For instance,, mean incidence of comolications get patients averages 0.51 in group I and 1.15 in grouo V (~<0.001). The nostsurgical ventilato~ weaning orocedure has been more difficult in patients with increased BW;~group I endotracheal intubation duration averages : 9 H; it averages 24 hours in group V (p<O.O01). Conclusion : stability of BW during congenital cardiac surgery is required. BW gain of 1.84 % + 2.02 increases significantly the incidence of nostsuro~cal comolications (cardiac failure, arrythmias, nieural effusion) and delays significantly ventilatory weaning time.",

Pittoni, G.P.Giron, Inst. of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, University of Padua, Italy. High frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) has proved to ensure an adequate alveolar ventilation with low peak airway pressure and small tidal volume (Vt) This may be advantageous in situations when the Vt at conventional intermittent (IPPV) or continuous (CPPV) positive pressure ventilation encroaches on the horizontal portion of the lung P-V curve. Six healthy Beagle dogs, II \u00a7 17 kg, were anaesthetized, paralized and intubated in the standard fashion. Sistemic, central venous and pulmonary arterial blood pressure, cardiac output via the thermodilution technique, arterial and mixed venous blood gases, airway pressure (Paw) at the end of the endotracheal tube and oesophageal pressure were monitored. The cardiac (CI), stroke (SI) and other cardiorespiratory indices were calculated using the standard equations. Ventilation with air was performed randomly alternating a volume-cycled ventilator at 15 b/m with an HFJV apparatus (VJP system) at 60, 120, 240, 480 b/m, Vt was regulated to maintain PaCO? at 38~2 mmHg. Cardiorespiratory values were obtained afte~ stabilization for both modes of ventilation increasing positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) progress~ vely from 0 to 2.0 kPa. The use of PEEP significantly decreased the CI in all modes of ventilation. The transition from IPPV or CPPV to HFJV at 60 andl2Ob/m,withPEEPheldconstant, led to a significant reduction of the inspiratory peak and an improvement of CI and SI due to the reduction of mean Paw. This improvement was more evident at PEEP 2.0 kPa. At frequencies of 480 b/m the increase of intrathoracic volume and of mean Paw markedly increased haemodynamic depression. The results confirm the efficacy of HFJV, at adequate frequencies, when the reduction of Vt brings about a reduction of the cardiovascular depression and reduces the risk of 'barotrauma'.",

Eanrath, H.K. Bouillon, W.-P. Fritsch, T. Scholten, Med. Kliniken, Universit~t Dl3sseldorf, FRG Introduction: The combination of cimetidins and pirenzepine results in a stronger and longer lasting suppression of gastric acid secretion than cimetidine alone. Therefore cimetidine plus pirensepine should be more effective in the prevention of upper GI-tract bleeding than cimetidine alone. Methods: Patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit of the University of D~sseldorf from May 1982 to November 1982 were included in the study. Upon admission all patients were randomized into one of the two treatment groups A or B by a table of random numbers. Patients with upper GI-tract bleeding, recent GI-tract operations,etc. were excluded from the protocol. Those in group A received 200 mgs cimetidine iv every 3 hours during the entire stay in the intensive care unit. Those in group B additionally received 40 mgs of pirenzepine/day by continuous infusion. Results: 95 patients of group A and 105 patients of group B met the criteria. The distribution of patients with regard to sex, age, and severity of illness were comparable for both treatment groups. There was only i patient with acute upper GI-tract bleeding and I with chronic bleeding in group B. No bleeding was observed in group A. Conclusions: In patients of a medical intensive care unit the prophylaxis of upper GI-tract bleeding by cimetidine alone proved to be effective. Therefore no additional positive effect of a combined treatment with cimetidine plus pirenzepine could be shown.

INTRODUCTION: The purpose was to analyze the effect of tra cheal suctioning (TS) in the gaseous interchange and comp~ re different methods. ~THODS: The transcutaneous P02 (Ptc02) was monitored with transcutaneous sensor (Kontron-La Roche) with simultaneous measurements of Pa02 in all patients (p). When there was no correlation between the Ptc02 and Pa02 the p was excluded. .We first studied two groups of ten patients: G:I= Fi02 50%, PEEP=O G:2=Fi02~ 50%, PEEP~IO cm H20 Aspirations (2-4) of 10 seconds were made in all patients. ..Secondly we comparatively studied two groups of 5 p. Grup 3= Fi02 ~ 50%, PEEP=O Grup 4=Fi02 ~50%, PEEP~IO cm H20 in whom 3 different methods of TS were applied. Method A: 2 aspirations of 10 sec. Method B: 2 aspirations of 10 sec plus Ambu 100% between aspirations and 1 minut after. Method C: the same as method B, plus 1 minut before. There was a more marked descent of Ptc02 in group 2 than in group 1 (36/16 mmHg, p < O. 05) and stabilization time was also more prolonged in the former group. There was a more marked descent of Ptc02 in group 4 than in group 3 (20/10 mmHg) with all methods, and stabilization was also more prolonged in group 4. In group 3 the methods applying Ambi 100% provoked hyperoxia (until 200 mmHg in some cases). CONCLUSIONS: TS in ventilated patients provokes hypoxia, especially in patients with PEEP~IO cm H20. Application of Ambu 100% does not prevent hypoxia in p with PEEP~IO am H20. These methods provoke detrimental hyperoxia in patients without PEEP.

Fifty-six patients were studied following coronary revascu lari~atian (CR). Five ECG's (preoperative, inmediately postoperative, at 24 and 48 hrs and on discharge) and 5 isoenzime C~-MB (u/l)determinations (preoperative, @,12,24 and 48 hrs) were made. Pre and postoperative VCG's were ma de in only 40 patients. Patients were classified according to appearance of postoperative electrocardiographic changes. Group A (23,2%) with ECG or VCG criteria of myocardial infarction; group B (12,5%) with intraventricular con duction disturbance (IVCD) and severe repolarization disturbance (SRD) defined as 2 mm ST ascent or depression or 5 mm negative T wave; group C (17, 8%) with SRD only; group D (46,4%) without ECG changes (IVCD not associated to SRD were included). RESULTS: Enzimatic results (maximum value) were: group A= 119~ 70; group B= 136 ~ 77; group C= 61~ 31 and group D= 51~ 28. No significative difference was found between A/B and C/D. Enzymatic level CK-MB in group A and B was higer than group C and D: A/C (p ~ 0.05), A/D (p < 0.001), B/C (p<O.05), B/D (p <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: There were no difference s between C and D groups. Group B presented the same level at CK-MB as group A although there was no necrotic image. These enzymatic results suggest further studies are needed to define the incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction following coronary revasculari~ation.

Medizinische UniversLt~tsklinik Mainz. Intensive care units (ICU) are the most expensive parts of hospitals. Resource expenditure can be easily estimated by using EOV. In the period fromApr. 1980 to Dec. 1981 (21 mths.) the percentage of covered beds estimated by midnight statistics was 85.95 % in the tota] hospital and 67.33 % in the ICU. Based upon the daily maximum covered beds the percentage was 72 %, and 75 % when calculated upon the maximum number of patients treated daily. The whole hospital (180 beds) had 4515 nursing days per month, the ICU (10 beds) Darticipated with 205 nursing days per month (4.5 %). The monthly resource expenditure for the hospital averaged 232 717,-DM, for the ICU 93 393,-OM according to 40.56 % of the total expenditure for 5.6 % of the total number of beds. Resource expenditureswere 91.92 DM per day in general, they were 462.87 DM in the ICU. The mean length of stay was 15 days in the whole hospital and 5.5 days in the ICU. Thus resource expenditure per patient was only 3 times higher for an intensive care patient in comparison to an average hospital patient. The resource expenditures were divided into the followingACUTE ALCOHOLIC INTOXICATION IN ADULTS DOES NOT INDUCE LACTIC ACIDOSIS AND HYPOGLYCEMIA : Ph. Auz~py, H.F. Boutron, J.M. Gauthier and G.

X ~ ~uP~DPV~C A severity score index is needed in AHp for classification of patients, comparison of groups and evaluation of new therapies because of the broad spectrum of the illness. The aim of this study was to compare a specific index as the one proposed by RANSON (I) (R) to two non specific indexes, acute physiologic score (APS) (2) and a resumed severity index (RSI). APS is based upon the results of 34 biological and clinical values. RSI is calculated from the results of 14 biological and clinical values generally obtained in all ICU patients. RSI has been validated in 789 French ICU patients. 31 patients with AHP were studied within the first two days after their admission to two ICUs. R, APS and RSI were measured in each patient. The prediction of dgath was used to evaluate the efficacy of each index. A highly significant correlation (p<O.OOl) was found between R and APS or RSI (r = 0.744 and 0.834).

Wattel, EBpital Calmette, C.H.U. Lille, FRANCE Patients hospitalized in critical unit for acute renal failure (ARF) in a multiorgan failure syndrome have often a poor intradialytic tolerance. Change from acetate to bicarbonate for dialysate buffering has been advocated to improve this dialytic tolerance. In a retrospective study, ?0 patients who received bicarbonate hemodialysi8 are compared with 106 patients who received acetate hemodialysis. If the mortality is not different between this two groups, intradialytic tolerance is significantly better (p< 0.001) in the bicarbonate group according to the mean intradialytic systolic blood pressure decrease, the collapse number and the mean vascular volume infusion. Ultrafiltration rate is higher and reach more often the previous values. On a biochemical point of view, hemodialysis efficacy is the same in the two groups according to the urea and creatinin clearance, but end dialysis bicarbonate plasma concentrations are higher and nearer the normal range in the bicarbonate group even tough predialysis plasma concentratio~ were similar. Only. one hypoglycemia without clinical consequence is observed due to the lack of gluOoee ine the bicarbonate dialysis. Nevertheless, in patients undercontrolled ventilation, a end dialysis alcalosis can occur ira hyperventilation is imposed. Conclusion : change from acetate to bicarbonate in dialyeate buffering improve the intradialytic tolerance of patients with ARF in a multiorgan failure syndrom.

Sepsis is known to cause severe metabolic disorders: reduction of plasma and muscle amino acid levels, especially muscle glutamine (arterio-venous differences showing an increased peripheral release of muscle AA), decrease in short life plasma proteins, increase in hormone levels, increase in free fatty acids and triglycerides. As we could show earlier there are significant metabolic differences between surviving and non surviving patients. Five patients with normal renal function were studied. They were manourished transferred from other hospitals, all survived. The received 2,5 g AA, 5 g glucose, and 1,5 g fat/kg BW/day. After starting PN, every 2. day plasma AA (art.&ven.), plasma short lif~ proteins; plasma insulin, cortisol, qndglucagon; fat metabolites; and nitrogen balance were determined until discharge from the ICU. Results: Nitrogen balances averaged -4 g/day. BUN was normal and renal excretion of AA below 3 %~ indicating good utilisation. Side effects, as vomiting, flush, or mind confusion, were not seen. Plasma insulin levels remained unchanged, glucagon levels decreased as well as cortiaol levels. Free fatty acid and triglyceride levels normalized. Prealbumin, retinol binding protein and trans ferrin levels ir~reased, indicating stimulated liver protein syn{hesis. In conclusion, PN with high dose AA could not establish positive nitrogen balance, but normal levels of total plasma AA and short life proteins were archived. We assigns,, that increased peripheral AA release in septic patients may be lessened by exogenous administered AA.

            "text": "IN HIGH-DOSE BARBITURATE THERAPY. C. Krier, K. Wiedemann, H. Polarz, Department of Anesthesia, University of Heidelberg, F R G Despite of the fact that the beneficial effect of barbiturates on the outcome of severe headinjury pat&ents remains controversial,high-dose barbiturate therapy is now commonly used in the management of raised intracranial pressure. The purpose of the study was to investigate the potential side-effects of high-dose thiopentone therapy in a total of 30 patients with focused interest on cardiovascular effects, effects on liver metabolism, qastro-intestinal complications and respiratory complications.The barbituratetreated patients were compared to a group of 27 patients with severe head-injury without highdose barbiturate therapy. The data obtained indicate i. a low incidence of hemodynamic changes when a regimen of slow initial loading is adopted. 2. a low incidence of hepatotoxic effects. 1 case of transient drug-induced jaundice is reported. 3. a high incidence of gastro-intestinal complications, ranging from benign erosions to acute upper gastro-intestinal hemorrhage. The occurence of oesophagitis is related to the esophageal sphincter dilatation and reflux, due to the high-dose barbiturates and demonstrated by endoscopic findings. 4. a h~gh incidence of contamination of the upper respiratory tract and of pneumonia., It is suggested that the suppressive effect of thiopentone on the immune response is 9esponsible for the high incidence of pulmonary complications. It is concluded that the high-dose barbiturate therapy is connected with high risks for the patient due to the multiple side-effects of barbiturates and that this form of therapy requires a extended monitoring and specific preventive measures. At the end of June 1981, 6 workers were intoxicated wlth the above mentioned substances while cleaninq an industrial basin. After a latent period of I to 3 days, symptoms of the neuroloqicpsychic kind occured in all patients with a upward tendency up to a clouding of consciousness and in the mogt severe cases even to a central resoiration depression, A development of pulmonary complications with massive infiltrations was observed. Artificial resniration theraoy was necessary in 3 patients.In 4 oatients epileptic activity was reqistered in the EEG. Iniatially all patients showed a leucocytosis up to 3o.ooo/mm 3, transaminases were slightly increased with an unward tendency. The execretion of tin in the urine corralated with the severity of intoxication as well as a hypokalemia un to 1,9 mval/l. The alasmasenaration done in 4 patients did not lead to the expected decline in the urine tin execretion.The aoplication of metalcaDtase R did not show a tendency to a higher tin execretion in the urine. The main treatment consisted in intensive care procedures. One oatient died because of eulmonary complications, liver cell damage and final kidney insufficiency. The neurohistoloqic findings showed remarkable changes in the central nervous system. I patient still needs intensive care because of hypotone hyperkinetic syndrome. The patient with the third hiqhest tin level still suffers from slightly cerebral deficit.Up to now, there is no report of human toxicological and intensive care experiences in the case of acute intoxications with these substances. This is a review of 30 deep toxic comas studied by BAER to establish its value in diagnos~g and prognosis in association with a physical determination of the level of the coma and toxic analysies.",

            "text": "Importance in diagnosis, a normal response was the most 9ommon finding, but in almost 40 % of the cases, we observed a delayed latency at different level of coma of different toxic etiologies. This result is opposed the commonly accepted idea that BAER are always normal in toxic coma and represent a strong argument to evocate the toxic origin. Therefore, delaye d latency should not exclude the diagnosis. Importance in prognosis : a normal response or a delayed latency is always associated with a good prognosis. But in the latter case the duration of the coma seems longer. So BAER might represent an argument for the use of an epuration method. On the other hand if we note a peak disappearrance as observed in 2 cases, the outcome will be poor~ perhaps due to anoxia. This could be screened for, rapidly, using this method. We studied 135 patients with aconite poisoning fatal dose taken p.o. is 2-4 mg. The main symptom in this state was acute cardiac arrhythmia developing suddenly during the first 30-50 minutes. The changes were characterized by progressive disturbance in conduction, excitability and automatism of the heart. Antidote therapy was not used, as it doesn't exist in this sphere. The patients were treated by intense therapy and resuscitation consisted in use of antiarrhythmic drugs (lidocaSne, novocaTnamide, etal), electric-pulsating therapy, electrocardiostimulating procedure, intensive ureapoiesis, gastric lavage and hemoresorption. We noted the high effectiveness of electro-pulsating therapy. The mortality rate was decreased in this group of patients by the described type of treatment. Stress ulceration is common in patients treated in Intensive Care and when associated with active bleeding carries a high mortality. Antacids effectively increase the stomach pH and decrease the evidence of GI bleeding, whereas cimetidine is not as effective in increasing pH nor in preventing GI bleeding in seriously ill patients. (I) A new histamine H~-receptor antagonist, ranitidine, has not been evaluated in these patients. The object of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of ranitidine in controlling the gastric pH at above 4. If the pH was ~elow 4 a bolus dose of 50 mgm iv of ranitidine was given and an infusion of Imgm/hr corm~eneed. The infusion was increased up t O 15 msm/hr pr decreased aecording to the pH of the stomach. A further object of the trial was to evaluate a continuous method for measuring gastric pH. This is necessary if the effectiveness of a continuous technique to increase pH is to be assessed. A pH electrode (Novo Indnstri A/S) was inserted together with the NG tube. The pH was continually measured and displayed enabling rapid adjustments to infusion rates of ranitidine to be made. This method was successfully employed in all patients and no adverse reactions attributable to ranitidine were noted. It is hoped that this technique will be the basis for a closed loop servo control system for cnntrolling gastric pH in seriously ill patients. Anaerobic infection is frequently suspected in post surgical acute renal failure (ARF). The aim of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of parenteral metronidazole in ARF patients treated by hemodialysis. 7 patients with post-surgical ARF, treated every other day by hemodialysis, received parenteral metronidazole in a dose of 500 mg administered in 20 minutes, eight hourl~ In the 7 patients serum values of metronidazole (high pressure liquid chromatography assa~were obtained before hemodlalysis, after the first injection, every 15 minutes for 2 hours and every hour for 8 hours. During hemodialysis serum levels were obtained after a second infusion every 30 mn for 2 hours and every hour to the end of hemodialysis. In 3 patients the therapy was maintained for 3 to 8 days and peak and trough levels were obtained before and after each injection. After the first injection peak levels were 19.03 \u2022 3:47 mg/l (mean \u2022 SD). Elimination half life (T I/2 B) was 7.06 \u2022 1.95 h. Trough levels were 5.92 \u2022 2.85 mg/l. These reSults were not different from those obtained in normal subjects. During hemodialysis T i/2 B was 3.45 \u2022 0.5 h corresponding to a mean decrease of 35 % in 4 to 6 h. There was no rebound after hemodialysis. In the three patients receiving repeated infusions the mean peak and trough values for the last five infusions were 18.5 mg/l andP.Omg/l, not different from values obtained after repeated infusion in normal subjects. Hemodialysis prevented significant accumulation of the drug. In conclusion : pharmacokinetics of I.V. metronidazole in ARF are similar to those of normal sujects. Hemodialysis increases the elimination rate. The usual frequency of infusion in normal subjects is suitable for treatment of ARF patients submitted to hemodialysis every other day.",
