In this study, we investigated the effects of extracts of Broussonetia papyrifera root bark (PRE) and its bioactive components on inflammation and insulin sensitivity. PRE inhibited TNF-\u03b1-induced NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity in the NF-\u03baB luciferase assay and pro-inflammatory genes' expression by blocking phosphorylation of I\u03baB and NF-\u03baB in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which were mediated by activating AMPK. Ten-week-high fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL6 male mice treated with PRE had improved glucose intolerance and decreased inflammation in adipose tissue, as indicated by reductions in NF-\u03baB phosphorylation and pro-inflammatory genes' expression. Furthermore, PRE activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and reduced lipogenic genes' expression in both adipose tissue and liver. Finally, we identified broussoflavonol B (BF) and kazinol J (KJ) as bioactive constituents to suppress pro-inflammatory responses via activating AMPK in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Taken together, these results indicate the therapeutic potential of PRE, especially BF or KJ, in metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes.",

However, dysregulated inflammatory processes result in chronic inflammation, which is increasingly seen as a major driver of numerous diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes [1] . Obese adipose tissue produces inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, monocyte chemokine protein (MCP)-1, and interleukin (IL)-6 [1] . Subsequently, the elevated inflammatory stimuli induce the activation of the inhibitor of \u03baB (I\u03baB) kinase (IKK)/NF-\u03baB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways, which negatively regulate insulin action in not only adipose tissue, but also other peripheral tissues, such as liver [2] . Thus, the accumulation of pro-inflammatory responses in adipose tissue may be one of the causal factors for insulin resistance. A previous study has demonstrated that pro-inflammatory gene expression is elevated in adipose tissue in the early onset of obesity, but in other tissues, such as liver and skeletal muscle, there is no differences in the expression of inflammatory gene expressions [3] . Thus, adipose tissues appear to act as priming tissues that respond to a high-fat diet (HFD) and initiate inflammation in obesity. Therefore, understanding the inflammatory responses in adipose tissues of obese individuals is of clinical importance.",

AMPK can be activated by various conditions. Starvation, hypoxia, exercise, and oxidative damages are the main cellular stresses for activating AMPK [4] . There are two well-known upstream kinases: liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) can activate AMPK via phosphorylation. Several reports clearly demonstrated that one of the major roles of AMPK is regulating metabolic requirement. For example, AMPK stimulates energy production pathways through fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial biogenesis, and glucose catabolism. On the other hand, it inhibits energy-consuming pathways, including fatty acids' synthesis and amino acids' biogenesis [5] . Thus, dysfunctions of AMPK or downstream signaling pathways could result in metabolic diseases, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes [4] .",

In addition, pro-inflammatory responses inhibited the activation of AMPK in adipose tissue and induced the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in vivo [11] . It has been reported that the infiltration of ATMs is significantly increased in AMPK\u03b11 \u2212/\u2212 mice, and these mice showed increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes, such as IL-6 or TNF-\u03b1, in adipose tissue [12] .

It has been shown that Broussonetia papyrifera has anti-tyrosinase and antioxidant activity [13, 14] and anti-inflammatory activities in cells [15] . Constituents of the roots of this plant, broussochalcone A, kazinol A, and kazinol I, have been reported as inhibitors of lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide (NO) production by suppressing NF-\u03baB activation in macrophages [16, 17] . Moreover, kazinol B, a B. papyrifera-derived prenylated flavan, has been shown to inhibit NO production [16] . Interestingly, kazinol B enhances glucose uptake via Akt (a serine/threonine kinase) and AMPK activation in adipocytes [17] . Collectively, these reports suggest that B. papyrifera might ameliorate inflammation, but to what degree it elicits systemic insulin sensitivity, and by what mechanism, remains unclear. In the present study, we aimed to demonstrate that roots of B. papyrifera improve pre-established insulin resistance and identify major bioactive compounds that modulate obese-associated inflammation in adipose tissue.",

Briefly, the total B. papyrifera root bark extracts (TPRE, yield 10.05%) were separated by SPOT-II MPLC (medium-pressure liquid chromatography) (Gilson, Middleton, WI, USA) using reversed-phase silica gel (YMC-Pack ODS-AQ HG, 20 \u00d7 250 mm, 10 \u00b5m, Kyoto, Japan) eluted with MeOH-H 2 O to give TPRE Nos. 1-8 ( Figure S1A and Figure 1B) . Broussoflavonol B and kazinol J were found to be components of TPRE No. 6 (PRE) based on the UPLC-PDA-QTof-MS chromatograms ( Figure S1C ). Among these fractions, TPRE No. 6 (PRE) was subjected to a GX-271 (automated liquid handler) semipreparative HPLC system (Gilson, Middleton, WI) using a reversed-phase column (YMC-Pack ODS-AQ-HG, 10\u00b5m) and eluted with the MeOH-H 2 O gradient system (55% \u2192 100% MeOH, 70 min) by 25 repeated injections of the samples (2 g/mL methanol dilutions) to yield four fractions (PRE Nos. 6-1~6-4). A further preparation.-HPLC procedure was repeated several times using each condition (see below). The fraction 6-3-5 (345.1 mg) enriched with broussoflavonol B was further isolated by prep.-HPLC (Gilson, Middleton, MA, USA). Broussoflavonol B (44.9 mg) and broussonol D (29.4 mg) were isolated using a YMC-Pack pro C8 column. The fraction 6-3-7 enriched with kazinol J was further isolated by prep.-HPLC (PLC 2020) with a gradient system of MeOH-H 2 O, and (-)-(2S)-kazinol I (7.6 mg), kazinol J (48.7 mg), broussoflavonol C (215.7 mg), and broussonol G (40.6 mg) were obtained. The isolated compounds were purified as described previously, and purity the was more than 95.0%, as determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography [18] . Two compounds were characterized using spectroscopic data, including 1 H, 13 C NMR, and HRMS, in comparison with previously published data [16, 19] . An ACQUITY UPLC\u2122 system (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) equipped with a binary solvent delivery manager and a photodiode array (PDA) was used for UPLC (ultra-performance liquid chromatography) analysis. HRMS analysis was performed using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) interface (Waters Q-TOF PremierTM, Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA). The NMR analysis was carried out using a Fourier transform (FT)-NMR spectrometer (JEOL ECZ500R, JEOL Ltd., Akishima, Tokyo, Japan) for 1D spectra ( 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR). The overall processes are described in Figure S1D . All extracts and single compounds for the experiments were prepared by dissolving in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA).",

Therefore, we tested whether PRE activated AMPK and NF-\u03baB in obese adipose tissue in vivo. Upon treatment with PRE, NF-\u03baB phosphorylation was significantly decreased, whereas AMPK phosphorylation was increased in epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) ( Figure  4A ). Next, we assessed the effects of PRE on inflammation in adipose tissue. As shown in Figure 4B , the expression of pro-inflammatory genes (Il-1\u03b2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)) was significantly reduced in eWAT after treatment with PRE. However, marker genes of macrophages (F4/80, cd11b, and cd68) or marker genes of the M2 macrophage, including arginase-1 (Arg-1), mannose receptor C-type 1 (Mrc-1), macrophage galactose binding lectin (Mgl), and Ym-1 (chitinaselike 3) were not changed ( Figure S5 ). Interestingly, PRE-treated HFD-fed mice showed significantly decreased expression of lipogenic genes (fatty acid synthase (Fasn), sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (Srebp-1c) , and Acc-1) in adipose tissue ( Figure 4C ). These results indicated that PRE had anti-inflammatory and anti-lipogenic activities in adipose tissue. ",

            "text": "Obesity is very closely related to chronic and low-grade inflammation. Many reports have suggested that insulin resistance accompanies chronic inflammation and abnormal mediator secretion in obese adipose tissue [21] , indicating that reduction of tissue inflammation could be an indispensable target for improving obesity-related metabolic syndromes. It has been reported that roots of B. papyrifera have been used as a suppressant for edema in traditional Chinese medicine [22] . The core phytochemicals in the roots of B. papyrifera are flavonols, flavans, and chalcones [23] . There is emerging evidence that these core phytochemicals have anti-inflammatory activities. [15, 16, 24] . In the present study, we focused on the anti-inflammatory effects of PRE in adipose tissue and investigated whether it could ameliorate systemic insulin resistance in obese mice. PRE potently inhibited TNF-\u03b1-induced inflammatory responses by suppressing NF-\u03baB activation in adipocytes. This effect improved not only glucose tolerance, but also hepatic steatosis in HFD-induced obese mice. Using the FDA guideline to calculate human equivalent doses (HED), the HED of this effective dose of PRE (40 mg/kg) was 195 mg/day in humans. This dose was lower than that of metformin (850 mg~2550mg/day) even though PRE was a crude extract. Furthermore, BF and KJ, the isolated phytochemicals from PRE, were the bioactive compounds that suppressed inflammatory responses in 3T3-L1 adipocytes through blocking NF-\u03baB signaling. Of significance, these effects were partially dependent on AMPK activation in adipocytes ( Figure S8) .",

            "text": "AMPK has been shown to have strong anti-inflammatory activity via inhibiting inflammatory responses in various in vivo models [6] . Various studies have shown that AMPK inhibits pro-inflammatory signaling in many tissues and cells, especially adipocytes and macrophages, which are the main cell types of adipose tissue [25, 26] . In addition, AMPK ameliorates insulin resistance in obesity [10, 11, 25, 26] . It has been reported that AMPK activators specifically suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory genes and the activation of NF-\u03baB-mediated signaling [27, 28] . The molecular mechanism for NF-\u03baB activation is: (1) the degradation of I\u03baB in a ubiquitin-dependent manner is triggered through its phosphorylation by IKK; (2) I\u03baB degradation results in nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB [29] . Based on these results, we proposed the roles of PRE and its constituents to inhibit NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity through the blockade of phosphorylation-mediated I\u03baB degradation and NF-\u03baB phosphorylation; this effect was reversed by inhibition of AMPK. Thus, PRE-mediated NF-\u03baB inactivation would likely be accompanied by inhibition of the TNF-\u03b1-stimulated IKK/I\u03baB/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. In addition to the identified signaling pathways, it remains to be elucidated whether other molecular mechanisms for the AMPK-mediated anti-inflammatory effect of PRE exist. AMPK has several phosphorylation targets [30] , but there are some reports suggesting that AMPK could inhibit NF-\u03baB activity and its signaling indirectly via sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) [11] , the forkhead box O (FoxO) family [30] , and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 co-activator (PGC-1\u03b1) [31] , which are known as downstream mediators of AMPK. These mediators could inactivate the p65 subunit of NF-\u03baB, and the expression of pro-inflammatory genes is subsequently repressed. Thus, further studies related to the underlying mechanism of how PRE and its active components regulate AMPK activation and its resultant anti-inflammatory effect are needed.",
