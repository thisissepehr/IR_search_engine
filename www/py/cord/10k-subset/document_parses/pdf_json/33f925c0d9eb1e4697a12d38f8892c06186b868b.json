Induction of heat shock proteins (HSP), i.e. of the major family member HSP70, is an important cytoprotective-resistance mechanism for monocytes/ macrophages (Mphi). Patients on haemodialysis present with a high infectious morbidity and enhanced carcinoma incidence. Renal insufficiency-related alteration of microbicidal and tumoricidal functions of Mphi, major effectors of the immune system, might promote these diseases. Methods. Freshly isolated Mphi from Sprague-Dawley rats 2 weeks after 5/6-nephrectomy and from patients on intermittent haemodialysis (IHD) were stimulated by heat shock (HS) and compared to stimulated Mphi of control rats or healthy volunteers (CTR). Expression of HSP72 (inducible HSP70) was assessed by RT-PCR, and/or flow cytometry. Apoptosis of Mphi was detected by flow cytometry (CD14/annexin V-labelling). Results. In rat Mphi, baseline HSP72 expression was similar in both groups, but its induction was significantly impaired in renal insufficiency (214 \u00b1 68% less HSP70-mRNA versus CTR, n = 6). In patients, HSF-1-mRNA and HSP72-mRNA/protein response to HS was significantly lower, but not affected by dialysis session itself. In parallel, apoptosis of Mphi of patients was enhanced (+83 \u00b1 29% constitutive apoptotic Mphi versus CTR, n = 8), and HS-dependent protection from apoptosis with and without serum depletion (48 h depletion: HS, +275 \u00b1 37% apoptotic Mphi versus CTR, n = 6; full medium: +166 \u00b1 62% versus CTR, n = 8, P < 0.05) was inferior. Conclusions. Impaired HSP72 stress response of Mphi in patients on haemodialysis might contribute to the observed immune dysfunction and, therefore, to the increased susceptibility to infection and malignancy. Stress impairment is not restricted to uraemia but is already present in a rat model of chronic kidney disease.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Patients on haemodialysis present with a high infectious morbidity, enhanced carcinoma incidence, impaired wound healing and reduced effect of vaccination-diseases that are directly related to the function of the immune system [1] [2] [3] [4] . Immunological abnormalities of leukocytes have been described in patients on dialysis [5] . Mphi (monocytes/ macrophages) are major effectors of the immune system with widespread microbicidal and tumoricidal functions that are altered in uraemia [6] [7] [8] . Uraemic immunodeficiency is a complication of renal failure reflecting stress, e.g. exerted by as yet poorly defined uraemic toxins, imbalances of antioxidants and pro-oxidants, malnutrition or iron overload, membrane bio-incompatibility and inflammation [9] [10] [11] . Therefore, patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) suffer from increased oxidative stress, which can only be ineffectively treated by haemodialysis [12] [13] [14] . The response of human cells to stress, e.g. heat shock (HS), is a highly conserved adaptive cell response found in all cells in all life forms conferring resistance to different stressors, i.e. increased temperature (fever), nutritional deficiency, oxidative stress or hypoxia [15] [16] [17] . The corresponding heat shock proteins (HSPs), like the major stressinducible family member HSP72 (70-kDa HSP, inducible HSP70, HSPA1A, HSP70-1) [18] , can also be found in cells under normal physiological conditions controlling the folding of proteins. Constitutively expressed HSP70 (Hsc70) binds to newly translated immature proteins and prevents premature and improper binding and folding [19] [20] [21] . This is vital, since HSP72-deficient animals are susceptible to stress or even not viable [22] . In response to stress, housekeeping activities of HSPs, e.g. degradation of unstable and misfolded proteins, control of regulatory proteins or transport of proteins, switch towards reaction against stress to increase the cell's chance of survival. The cellular injury decreases, either by induction of cytoresistance or by enhancement of repair mechanisms [18] . Thus, HSP72 induction confers protection even against sublethal damage causing apoptosis and is, therefore, referred to as a cellular lifeguard. We and others showed HSP72-dependent injury protection of monocytes [23, 24] . Of note, housekeeping functions of HSPs are critically involved, e.g. as potent immune adjuvants, into the innate and adaptive immune response in inflammation, infection and tumour defence [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . In the case of infection, HSP72 induction is even crucial keeping Mphi alive and, therefore, capable for antihazardous actions [31] [32] [33] . Several factors and pathways have been identified as responsible triggers causing immunodeficiency in patients with ESRD [8, 34, 35] . But still, the underlying mechanisms determining Mphis' dysfunction are complex and remain, to a certain extent, unknown. Thus, they are addressed in this study. Having identified a reduced stress-related HSP72 response in Mphi of rats with chronic kidney disease, we used HS, as a simple model of fever/stress, to investigate the capacity of HSP72 induction in Mphi of patients on intermittent haemodialysis (IHD).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 227, "end": 230, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 231, "end": 234, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 235, "end": 238, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 239, "end": 242, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 331, "end": 334, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 491, "end": 494, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 495, "end": 498, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 499, "end": 502, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 760, "end": 763, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 764, "end": 768, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 769, "end": 773, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 929, "end": 933, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 934, "end": 938, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 939, "end": 943, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1223, "end": 1227, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1228, "end": 1232, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1233, "end": 1237, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1384, "end": 1388, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1632, "end": 1636, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1637, "end": 1641, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1642, "end": 1646, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1739, "end": 1743, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2102, "end": 2106, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2322, "end": 2326, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2327, "end": 2330, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2522, "end": 2526, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2527, "end": 2531, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2532, "end": 2536, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2537, "end": 2541, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2542, "end": 2546, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2547, "end": 2551, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2681, "end": 2685, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2686, "end": 2690, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2691, "end": 2695, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2819, "end": 2822, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2823, "end": 2826, "text": "34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2827, "end": 2830, "text": "35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "We enrolled 37 stable patients (20 males) on IHD with mean age of 38 (range 18-76) years chosen at random from the Dialysis Unit of the University Hospital M\u00fcnster (M\u00fcnster, Germany).

Inhibition of constitutive Mphi apoptosis by heat shock (HS, 40 min, 47 \u2022 C).

HS was capable of downregulating basal apoptosis in patients to a lower extent than in controls (3 \u00b1 2% in CTR versus 8 \u00b1 3% in patients, n = 8, P < 0.05). Forty-eight-hour serum depletion (0.2% FCS) caused apoptosis (29 \u00b1 5% in CTR versus 36 \u00b1 6% in patients, n = 6, P < 0.05). HS downregulated apoptosis in both patients and controls, but controls showed a significantly reduced apoptosis rate when compared to patients (4 \u00b1 3% in CTR versus 15 \u00b1 2% in patients, n = 6, P < 0.05).

Reduced HSP72 expression was accompanied by significant lower mRNA expression of the responsible transcription factor HSF-1 [40] and resulted in reduced cellular resistance to pro-apoptotic stress. Upregulation of HSP72 in human monocytes started shortly after HS ( Figure 3B ) and, therefore, confirmed specific detection of the inducible form of HSP70. We have chosen a high and rather long thermal stress, because lower stimulation was less effective ( Figure 3A ). Expression of HSP72 declined with time (peak 9-12 h, Figure 3B ) but is still, as previously demonstrated, even 60 h later enhanced [23] . The rapid and massive induction of HSP acted strongly anti-apoptotic and allowed survival of monocytes, even when thermal stress with sublethal temperature or stress by serum starvation was applied (low apoptosis and necrosis rates, Figure 7 ). These results are consistent with previous studies mostly analysing cell lines, which confirmed the role of HSP conferring resistance to physical stress or pro-apoptotic triggers [18, 21, 41] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 193, "end": 196, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 197, "end": 200, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 201, "end": 204, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 205, "end": 208, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 209, "end": 212, "text": "39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2200, "end": 2204, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2677, "end": 2681, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 3108, "end": 3112, "text": "[18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3113, "end": 3116, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3117, "end": 3120, "text": "41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 421, "end": 427, "text": "Fig. 7", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2342, "end": 2351, "text": "Figure 3B", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2532, "end": 2541, "text": "Figure 3A", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2598, "end": 2607, "text": "Figure 3B", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2917, "end": 2925, "text": "Figure 7", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Several attempts were made, to clarify the mechanisms causing immunodeficiency in patients with ESRD.

Memoli et al. stated that the impaired immunocompetence observed in Mphi of patients on IHD results from 'chronic over-stimulation' caused by pro-inflammatory cytokines, complement activation and toxins, conducting a decreased resonance against further stimulation (fatigue) [35] . Nevertheless, we could neither detect dialysis session-dependent HSP72 induction (stimulation) nor find elevated baseline HSP72 in patients (Figures 4 and 8) or rats with renal insufficiency (Figure 2) . Recently, and in contrast to our data, Calabrese et al. measured elevated HSP70 level in lymphocytes of patients with diabetic nephropathy [44] . As diabetes-related stress and patient's metabolism considerably differ between diabetic and non-diabetic patients and the measurements were performed on EDTA-treated lymphocytes (leading via calcium efflux to pre-and de-activation of cellular pathways), the results may vary. Further, monocytes of patients on peritoneal dialysis exhibit significant HS response after contact with peritoneal dialysis fluid meaning that they are not overstimulated [45] .

In contrast, skeletal muscle of chronic dialysis patients in the steady state contains increased amounts of protective HS proteins [51] . Notably, HSP72 expression in long-term urea-incubated Mphi responded to a significant higher extent to HS than controls ( Figure 6) . A possible explanation for urea-induced HSP72 expression in heated Mphi is that urea-mediated protein destabilization may be enhanced by increased temperature.

Glutamine starving reduces thermoresistance (to fever) of Mphi that is, according to Pollheimer et al., caused by impaired HSP70 response [54] . Thus, one can assume that glutamine depletion contributes to the reduced HSP72-HS response and favours apoptosis as demonstrated in patients' Mphi ( Figure 7) . Nevertheless, accelerated efflux of amino acids from the muscle (protein catabolism) helps to stabilize the intracellular concentrations of amino acids during IHD [53] .
