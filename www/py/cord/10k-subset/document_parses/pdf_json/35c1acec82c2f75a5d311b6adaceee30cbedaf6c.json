A multitude of genetic and exogenous causes are responsible for few other cases. Goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of GATA2 deficiency in children and adults with PAP and hematologic disorders. Methods: Of 21 patients with GM-CSF-autoantibody negative PAP, 13 had no other organ involvement and 8 had some form of hematologic disorder. The latter were sequenced for GATA2. Results: Age at start of PAP ranged from 0.3 to 64 years, 4 patients were children. In half of the subjects GATA2-sequence variations were found, two of which were considered disease causing. Those two patients had the typical phenotype of GATA2 deficiency, one of whom additionally showed a previously undescribed featurea cholesterol pneumonia. Hematologic disorders included chronic myeloic leukemia, juvenile myelo-monocytic leukemia, lymphoblastic leukemia, sideroblastic anemia and two cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). A 4 year old child with MDS and DiGeorge Syndrome Type 2 was rescued with repetitive whole lung lavages and her PAP was cured with heterologous stem cell transplant. Conclusions: In children and adults with severe GM-CSF negative PAP a close cooperation between pneumologists and hemato-oncologists is needed to diagnose the underlying diseases, some of which are caused by mutations of transcription factor GATA2. Treatment with whole lung lavages as well as stem cell transplant may be successful.",

PAP is caused by (i) genetic diseases which result in dysfunction of surfactant or surfactant production (SFTPC, SFTPB, ABCA3, TTF1 deficiency) mainly presenting during infancy, by (ii) disruption of GM-CSF signaling from mutations in the receptor (GM-CSFRa, GM-CSFRb) or from acquired autoantibodies against GM-CSF, and by (iii) disorders that presumably impair surfactant clearance because of abnormal numbers or defective phagocytic functions of alveolar macrophages [2] .

GATA2 deficiency is a recently described disorder of hematopoiesis, lymphatics, and immunity, caused by heterozygous mutations leading to haplo-insufficiency of the transcription factor GATA2. The disease presents with a complex array of diagnoses and symptoms of varying extent including MDS, AML, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), severe viral, disseminated mycobacterial and invasive fungal infections, pulmonary arterial hypertension, warts, panniculitis, human papillomavirus (HPV) positive tumors, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive tumors, venous thrombosis, lymphedema, sensorineural hearing loss, miscarriage and hypothyroidism [6] . PAP has been reported in about 18 % of all subjects with GATA2 deficiency [6, 10] . However, not much is known on the severity and clinical course of PAP in these subjects, which were exclusively adults. Pneumologists treating patients with severe PAP not caused by autoantibodies against GM-CSF frequently do not know the cause of these rare conditions [11] .",

No genetic cause was identified; Pearson syndrome and mutations in ALAS2 and SLC25A38 were excluded. His bone marrow showed massive erythroid hyperplasia with dyserythropoiesis and marked depression of myeloid cells. Pulmonary infiltrates were initially interpreted as pneumonia. At the age of 5 months a CMV infection was successfully treated with ganciclovir. At 8 months he developed respiratory failure (PaO2 60 mmHg, PaCO2 55 mmHg) with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. The diagnosis of PAP was made by analysis of BAL fluid and open lung biopsy. From the age 8 to 23 months the boy underwent 11 therapeutic WLLs, improving his general condition and gas exchange.

A precise history and knowledge of the disease course may help to select potential candidates with high confidence for specific genetic diagnostic. GATA2 gene mutations were associated with PAP in two cases; p.Y377D is a novel missense mutation demonstrated here to present with the classical mono-MAC syndrome [16] . p.R398W has previously been described in six patients, of whom 2 had a PAP [6] . Here we add the histopathological feature of cholesterol pneumonia to this phenotype. Of interest, further heterozygous variations in GATA2 were identified in two other subjects; however these were predicted to be non-disease causing ( Table 3) . As not all subjects with a specific GATA2 mutation causing GATA2 deficiency develop PAP [6] , additional factors are involved which determine PAP. Patients with the same GATA2 mutation need to be investigated further and experimental models will help to better understand the molecular defect(s) leading to PAP. Similarly, in non-GATA2 deficient patients with PAP and hematologic abnormalities, the mechanism of PAP development is unknown. Currently, their PAP is presumed to be due to reduced monophagocytic function in the alveoli to clear surfactant [17] . Best proof for the critical role of bonemarrow derived alveolar macrophages for surfactant homeostasis is provided by the correction of PAP by SCT. This was shown here for the first time in a young child. Shortly, i.e. within days after take of SCT, there was clearing of PAP, superseding rapidly the need for therapeutic WLLs (Fig. 1) .",

As more than 90 % of PAP in adulthood is caused by autoantibodies against GM-CSF [1, 21, 22] , this condition has to be initially excluded by analysis of serum [23, 24] . None of our patients had increased levels of GM-CSF autoantibodies. Serum levels of GM-CSF are low in autoimmune PAP [25] , whereas elevated values can be found in congenital GM-CSFRa or GM-CSFRb defects and possibly in other forms of PAP. Thus, particularly in children these other entities need to be excluded. In our cohort of patients with severe PAP and hematologic diseases, serum GM-CSF level were low to intermediate, supporting some up regulation of GM-CSF. Next, genetic analysis of GATA2 is helpful in order to diagnose the underlying hematologic entity more precisely, in particular in patients who meet the broad but characteristic phenotype of GATA2 deficiency [6] . This diagnostic algorithm for PAP will allow differentiating important subgroups and may help to identify further genetic abnormalities, known or suspected to be associated with PAP.",
