In Hraiech's report [1], Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) reactivation was diagnosed mainly by throat or BAL samples, and only 3 patients (5%) exhibited a positive HSV viremia, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation was diagnosed mainly from blood PCR. However, whether a positive PCR from the airway sample should be treated as a reactivation or as an evidence of infection is still debatable [2] . Previous study [3, 4] found that seropositivity for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), one of Herpesviridae, was associated with mortality of ICU patients with respiratory failure. Thus, when looking for the association of reactivation and the outcome, we suggested that only patients with a seropositivity for Herpesviridae should be included. Furthermore, Hraiech and colleagues [1] found that HSV reactivation occurred earlier than CMV reactivation. In our study, airway sample may show an earlier and higher positivity than serum samples for EBV [3] . Therefore, the time of reactivation for HSV and CMV should be compared for samples from serum and airway, respectively.",
