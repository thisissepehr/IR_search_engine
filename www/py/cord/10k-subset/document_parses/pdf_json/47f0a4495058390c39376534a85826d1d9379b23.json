The Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which has thousands of years' clinical application among China and other Asian countries, is the pioneer of the ''Multi-component-multi-target'' and network pharmacology. Hundreds of different components in a TCM prescription can cure the diseases or relieve the patients by modulating the network of potential therapeutic targets. Although there is no doubt of the efficacy, it is difficult to elucidate convincing underlying mechanism of TCM due to its complex composition and unclear pharmacology. Without thorough investigation of its potential targets and side effects, TCM is not able to generate large-scale medicinal benefits, especially in the days when scientific reductionism and quantification are dominant. The use of ligand-protein networks has been gaining significant value in the history of drug discovery while its application in TCM is still in its early stage. This article firstly surveys TCM databases for virtual screening that have been greatly expanded in size and data diversity in recent years. On that basis, different screening methods and strategies for identifying active ingredients and targets of TCM are outlined based on the amount of network information available, both on sides of ligand bioactivity and the protein structures. Furthermore, applications of successful in silico target identification attempts are discussed in details along with experiments in exploring the ligand-protein networks of TCM. Finally, it will be concluded that the prospective application of ligand-protein networks can be used not only to predict protein targets of a small molecule, but also to explore the mode of action of TCM.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Drug discovery was once an empirical process when the effect of the medicine was purely based on phenotype readout, while the mode of action of drug molecules remained unknown.

Three main pathways that SJW intervenes were found by mapping these proteins onto KEGG pathways. Active components in SJW mainly intervene with neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, the calcium signaling pathway, and the gap junction related pathway, pertinent to targets including NMDA-receptor, CRF1 receptor, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1D, dopamine receptor D1. The networks show that the effect of SJW is similar to that of combinations of different types of antidepressants. However, the inhibitory effects of the SJW on each of the pathway are lower than other individual agents.

However, the only option we have to uncover the underlying mechanism of TCM at the molecular level is to make use of the theory of reductionism. Of course, for complex systems, the reduction method can only reach to a certain depth since it becomes more troublesome as we get deeper. Therefore, some researchers tend to reduce the mechanism of TCM to the level of ''multi-drug, multi-target, multi-gene'' at present, and for further reduction to the level of ''single-drug, single-target, single gene'', the problem of emergentism [125] in philosophy needs to be addressed properly.

Therefore, the use of cross-platform database (TCM compounds and recipe database, see Sect. 14.2 in this paper) and the improvement on modeling technique (computational method of ligand-protein interactions, see Sect. 14.3 in this paper), will afford the basis of in silico research for future modernization and development of TCM. It can be foreseen that, one future direction is to use these TCM databases and predictive models to reveal the pharmacological effect of TCM, through the establishment of ligand-protein networks or, ''multi-drug, multitarget, multi-gene'' relationships.

Virtual screening and informatics in the drug discovery area have already been proven to be quite useful either to predict potential new drug and target candidates for experimentalists or explore the functional mechanism at the molecular level. A large number of drugtarget interactions have thus been gained and the resulted drug-target networks will also be quite beneficial to investigate the underlying mechanism of multi-component drugs, such as the TCM. With further applications of these methods in TCM area, we are expecting to reveal the mode of action underlying polypharmacology of TCM.
