The WHO and the international community's belated responses have yet to quell the epidemic. The crisis is characteristic of a failure to properly comply with the International Health Regulations 2005. More generally, it stems from a failure of international health justice as articulated by a range of legal institutions and instruments, and it should prompt us to question the state and direction of approaches to the governance of global public health. This paper queries what might be done to lift global public health as a policy arena to the place of prominence that it deserves. It argues that there are at least two critical reasons for the past, present and easily anticipated future failings of the global public health regime. After exploring those, it then articulates a new way forward, identifying three courses of action that might be adopted in realising better health outcomes and global health justice, namely value, institutional and legal reform.",

Though acknowledging that the reasons will be myriad, it argues that they are almost certainly connected to two phenomena: (1) the ghettoization of global public health as an international policy sphere, with key public health advocates and policy bodies politically marginalised; and (2) the disjointed character and uncoordinated nature of the global public health framework that has evolved (perhaps in part as a result of the first phenomenon). After exploring these phenomena, this paper offers a theoretical foundation for global public health moving forward, elucidating the idea of global health justice. Finally, it articulates how we might reorient global public health as a core agenda item for international law and policy so that we might better and more quickly achieve improved health on an equitable basis. In doing so, it focuses on moral values, institutional reform/reaffirmation, and normative law-making.",

These crises, like many of our social goals and policies, were both created and responded to by stakeholders outwith the health sector even though, as observed by WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, they had and continue to have a direct impact on health [19] . In short, with their urgency and potential to ruin (and make) fortunes, these policy targets have side-lined and syphoned funds away from health-oriented organisations and their policy agendas and programmes. Such has permitted, or rather is indicative of, a neoliberal perspective with a relatively narrow value-base which suffuses our public institutions and dominates our international politics, including the politics that impact directly and profoundly on health.",

The eclipse of the WHO in the 1980 s, together with the rise of the WTO, through its many normative instruments, 6 as a central definer (shaper and limiter) of health policy has been critical to the impoverishment of global public health as a policy target [2, 74, 91, 107] . Although some of the WTO's instruments contain provisions preserving national competencies to protect life and health, 7 they are difficult to access in practice (Abbott 1 No. 14; [18] , and trade harmonisation is doing more to force standards down around the world than to raise them up because these instruments require uniform standards that are least restrictive [23, 105] . Ultimately, they erode the ability of international, national, local public health officials to guide and to take measures in support of public health, and they shift public spending to areas other than public health.

While the objectives of these actors are undoubtedly valuable, their perspectives are mostly narrow and their actions discretely targeted, often siloed by disease. Additionally, their efforts to secure funds and policy space are competitive as against each other. Their operation, together with the many other actors in this space, not only reduces efficiencies, but also reduces transparency and accountability around health-related decision-making. The bottom line is that key decisions are made out-with democratic processes and reviewable government agencies, lines of accountability are unclear, and measures for success can be opaque.",

However, the WHO has declined in eminence and vision since its post-war foundation, and, rather than fight that slide, it has settled into the rather limited role of evidence-collector and technical advisor [30] . Indeed, in the context of the Ebola crisis, WHO Director-General, Margaret Chan, described the WHO as a 'technical agency', a lamentable admission. In any event, its frailties are such that it has rarely influenced areas of public policy external to health even when they are closely linked to health, and the areas of trade and intellectual property are instructive (Schaffer et al. 2005). While one must concede that the WHO, even properly funded and politically ambitious, would not have the capacity to participate in every policy action impacting on health, it still must be said that the WHO has not offered the strong leadership that it should, and that global public health needs and deserves.",

They are meant to encourage surveillance capacity and ensure open communication and prompt reporting between nations (Articles 5-9), and to promote rapid and harmonised practices and standards of conduct in the event of incidents (Articles 9, 10, 13 and Part III), again while limiting to the greatest extent possible restrictions on trade (i.e., the movement of people and goods within and across borders) (Parts IV, V and VI).

Unfortunately, we have failed by almost every measure to realise our hopes and objectives for global public health, as that idea is articulated in the WHO Constitution, the MDGs, and the many principled statements that have both preceded and followed them.

The centrality and virtue of this position undergirds our hope for a humanity grounded in dignity, autonomy, and the realisation of human potential, which hope is contained in the ideas of shared humanity, shared community, and the collaborative journey of becoming found in all forms of religious thought, and in secular social and rights theories, including natural law theories, positivism, utilitarianism, and more [88] . Importantly, as acknowledged by our many international human rights instruments, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and more, everyone is equally entitled to the potential to flourish. This idea of equality must be a central tenet of the moral foundation, and it is particularly germane in a context that exhibits such stark inequalities of health potential. The need to give all people a chance at health, means that it is immoral for people to be deprived of their health capabilities such that their human flourishing and human agency is reduced [77, 79] . Recognition of this has informed claims that human health should be both intrinsically and instrumentally valued and seen as a social right rather than as a commodity, and that justice demands that actions be taken to support people's 13 Here note the efforts of Marxist communists, New Deal welfarists, Keynesian capitalists, and others. 14 In short, I agree with the many of the arguments offered by [43] and [53] with respect to the value and necessity of a moral element to the law. [77] emphasises the importance of shared moral responsibility, arguing that the global community:",

Indeed, in recent years, ideas around this (often illdefined) right, which implicates more established rights to life, to dignity, and to physical integrity, have informed health policy reforms and jurisprudence around the world. 17 Courts are much more inclined than in decades past to enforce such socioeconomic rights despite the fact that they will have consequences for public policy directions, healthcare system priorities, and budget allocations. 18 Usefully, this right, informed by the above moral foundation and equity-based theory, bears all the characteristics of a defensible right [54, 62] , 19 and has been defended as universal by way of a pluralistic approach. For example, [12] asserts that the combined weight of arguments from special rights to healthcare, harmprevention, and prudential arguments of the sort used to justify public health measures are sufficient to do the work of an alleged universal right to minimum of health care, but he also notes that the need for some fair procedure for reaching a social decision on which set of services to provide. Here, of course, [77] , has offered an answer. Drawing on Sen's concept of 'positional objectivity', 20 she claims that a common or shared standard of health can be formulated which will permit 16 [45] . 19 The salient characteristics of modern human rights include: (1) they are definite and high priority norms whose pursuit is mandatory; (2) they are notionally universal, held by people regardless of race, sex, religion, social position, nationality, geographic location, etc.; (3) they exist independently of recognition or implementation, serving then as standards of critique; (4) though not absolute and exception-less, they are normatively strong enough to prevail in conflicts with contrary norms, and justify international action; (5) they imply duties for both individuals and governments; (6) they establish minimum standards of decent social and government practice [62] . 20 The concept of 'positional objectivity' allows that individual circumstances can be acknowledged in assessments with a high degree of objectivity, with the overall aim being to design a legitimate or defensible 'view from nowhere' [80] . capability comparisons, so that we can better identify what is needed to attain greater health equity on a global scale, and thereafter implement coherent frameworks to achieve that global health justice.",

With respect to the latter, the Recitals identify 'common dangers' to health, and state that the extension to all peoples of the benefits of medical, psychological and related knowledge is essential to the fullest attainment of health. Article 1 identifies the WHO's objective as the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health. These expressions place the collective at the centre of our thinking, and they highlight the shared phenomenon of health, and the joint and collaborative nature of achieving it.

To do nothing while people are dying of starvation or disease is to fail to respect them as human beings, and it has been argued that we might be compelled to prevent such harms by, for example, being taxed to support efforts to prevent them [61] .",

In this regard, the Adelaide Statement on Health in All Policies (2010) (Adelaide Statement (2010)) is instructive. It states that good health enables and enhances all sorts of human activities, and reports that escalating treatment costs are placing unsustainable burdens on healthcare resources. As such, governments need institutionalised processes for cross-sector problem solving. This is, of course, increasingly important because of the decentred nature of most policy settings. 26 The Adelaide Statement (2010) then advocates a 'Health in All Policies' (HiAP) approach to policy development and regulation.

This deliberation should be facilitated by the production of and referral to empirical evidence, and by the calling upon of expert advice, including that from civil society. Again, it is not just health agencies that must do this; all agencies and actors should be expected to consider the health implications of their actions, and to demonstrate that the actions chosen either promote health, or, at the very least, do not directly or indirectly detract from health, wellbeing or equity. The idea is that health authorities will assist in these deliberations. 27 Finally, in addition to ensuring that it models the qualities of procedural justice and good governance-integrity, transparency, accountability, efficiency, and reflexivity-the WHO must demand the same from all of the organisations with which it partners, and it should audit for same. Here integrity refers to ensuring that agencies act honestly, without corruption, and in the best interests of their stakeholders (patients and publics), thereby encouraging justified public trust and cooperation. It has been reported that health institutions are among the most corrupt sectors in developing countries (Lindelow et al. [51] , and that corruption has profound impacts on production and wellbeing [109] . Transparency refers to ensuring avenues of participation in goal-setting and decision-making by interested stakeholders, sharing information that forms the basis of decisions, and being clear about how decisions are arrived at. Accountability has to do with ensuring that decision-makers and those tasked with operationalising decisions are clearly identified together with the limits of their authority. It is about ensuring that each organisation adheres to the rule of law, with some form of oversight and sanctions for breaches of duties. Efficiency relates to the need to ensure that resources are deployed properly and effectively. It requires clear objectives for actions, reasonable targets, rationally connected measures of success, and coordination among all those involved in the undertaking Finally, reflexivity demands processes for rigorous assessment of objectives, methods and indicators of success, and for revising those in an effective and efficient manner. If the utilisation of health resources is to be maximised, the WHO needs to demand that those expending them meet these principles or qualities.",

Similarly, the EU has long made the idea of 'the common market' a central consideration in all of its activities. One can find market defences, references to how the market is implicated, and claims to market improvements in almost every Directive and Regulation the EU adopts. Examples include those relating to the import and authorisation of goods, including medical devices, and to the undertaking of research and development, and in policies relating to the organisation of cross-border healthcare interventions, and energy production and distribution. which are either ignored in practice, 28 or overridden by hard law rules generated in other sectors. 29 Instead, it should take up the legislative function that is its birthright.",

For example, it should influence which considerations are deemed sufficient and which interests are deemed just when adopting courses of action through law. When it comes to considerations of international distributive justice, it should demand that actors take account of the processes by which states and institutions work to distribute material resources relating to health (as opposed to focusing narrowly on finance, as has been the traditional approach) [9] . That this has not happened is a testament to the limits of the law, particularly when political wills are focused on another direction. Nonetheless, the explicit recognition of this right in multiple international instruments combined with increased recognition (by courts, for example) that the right can and will result in obligations to act, should fortify those seeking to advance global public health. Actors need to take and make space to open discussions about values like solidarity and equity and about improved mechanisms for operationalising them. The WHO has an important role to play in this movement, and it should take steps to improve its own and its partners' structures and processes, and additionally move the international community toward a binding convention on global public health so that justice can finally be a hope for those who currently have little.",

While many factors have contributed to our failure to respond promptly and with compassion to the suffering of others, both generally and in relation to crises like this, I have argued that there are two critical factors. One is the dominant ideology which has marginalised global public health and health institutions. Another is the fragmented and disjointed quality of the global public health sector; its institutions lack integration and coordination, and its instruments lack scope.
