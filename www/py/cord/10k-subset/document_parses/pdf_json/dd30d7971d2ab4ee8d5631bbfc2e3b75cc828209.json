It is not clear which enzyme subtypes are secreted and what the relationships are between enzyme activity, biophysical and biochemical parameters, and clinical outcomes. We aimed to measure the enzyme and identify its subtypes and to study its biochemical and biophysical effect. The secondary aim was to correlate enzyme activity with clinical outcome. Methods: Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in 24 infants with ARDS and 14 controls with no lung disease. Samples were assayed for secretory phospholipase A2 and molecules related to its activity and expression. Western blotting and captive bubble surfactometry were also performed. Clinical data were real time downloaded. Results: Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (814 (506-2,499) vs. 287 (111-1,315) pg/mL; P = 0.04), enzyme activity (430 (253-600) vs. 149 (61-387) IU/mL; P = 0.01), free fatty acids (4.3 (2.8-8.6) vs. 2 (0.8-4.6) mM; P = 0.026), and minimum surface tension (25.6 \u00b1 6.1 vs. 18 \u00b1 1.8 mN/m; P = 0.006) were higher in ARDS than in controls. Phospholipids are lower in ARDS than in controls (76.5 (54-100) vs. 1,094 (536-2,907) \u03bcg/mL; P = 0.0001). Three enzyme subtypes were identified (-IIA, -V, -X), although in lower quantities in controls; another subtype (-IB) was mainly detected in ARDS. Significant correlations exist between enzyme activity, free fatty acids (\u03c1 = 0.823; P < 0.001), and surface tension (\u03c1 = 0.55; P < 0.028). Correlations also exist with intensive care stay (\u03c1 = 0.54; P = 0.001), PRISM-III 24 (\u03c1 = 0.79; P< 0.001), duration of ventilation (\u03c1 = 0.53; P = 0.002), and oxygen therapy (\u03c1 = 0.54; P = 0.001).

In fact, sPLA2 activity seems to be downstream correlated with clinical severity and some clinical outcomes. This study partially expands the knowledge accumulated on adults and, for the first time, provides specific data for pediatric ARDS in this regard. sPLA2 activity and identification sPLA2 activity is increased, as well as TNF\u03b1 [10] , and FFA, the product of reaction catalyzed by sPLA2. As previously reported [12] , a significant correlation exists between TNF\u03b1 and sPLA2, confirming the role of TNF\u03b1 as enhancer of sPLA2 expression. [10] This leads to relevant consequences in terms of biochemical and biophysical effects. Total amount of phospholipids is also reduced in BALF of ARDS patients, although a qualitative alteration of the phosphilipid pool is also likely to occur (see below). Adult ARDS patients have lower levels of SP-A [21] and this protein is known to directly inhibit sPLA2-IIA [32, 33] . SP-A binds sPLA2 through a direct protein-protein interaction, thus it has been expressed as a ratio [32, 33] . Our data seem to suggest that SP-A could be relatively lacking and that the interaction between sPLA2 and SP-A could play a role also in pediatric ARDS patients. However, the difference in sPLA2/SP-A ratio between cases and controls is not statistically significant, possibly due to our small population size: claryfing the role of SP-A is worth to be done with a specific study. In fact, commercially available surfactants do not have SP-A and this may account for the variable efficacy of surfactant replacement therapy. [9] sPLA2-IIA, -V, and -X are highly expressed in nearly all infants and secreted into the alveoli. These subtypes are also detected, although in lower amount, in some controls and this is consistent with animal data showing their expression in total lung extracts, as sPLA2-IIA is produced from various circulating cells [2] and sPLA2-V and -X from airway epithelial cells [34] . Presence of some amount of sPLA2 isotypes may be due to their physiologic roles as anti-infective molecules [2] or to a certain degree of inflammation. In fact, our controls were intubated infants and some ventilation-induced inflammation is unavoidable. While the importance of sPLA2-IIA had been already highlighted in ARDS [5, 6] , sPLA2-V and -X were only suspected to play a role, given the animal data available so far. These studies showed that sPLA2-V expression in mice lung is associated with surfactant hydrolysis [35] and gene targeted mice lacking sPLA2-V presented a milder form of acute lung injury with lower inflammation [36] . Similarly, sPLA2-X can efficiently hydrolyse surfactant phospholipids in vitro and this activity is also inhibited by SP-A [2, 33] . Our findings in human infants with ARDS seem to confirm a role for sPLA2-V and -X. A propeptide of sPLA2-IB had been detected in serum of adult ARDS patients but not in controls [37] : this is consistent with our data showing presence of sPLA2-IB in 75% of patients. Given the widespread tissue distribution of sPLA2-IB [1, 2] , it is possible that this subtype arrives to the lung after production elsewhere or from circulating inflammatory cells reaching the lung. Alternatively, sPLA2-IB may be locally triggered by sPLA2-IIA, since a specific cross-talk exists between the two subtypes [38] . These data are relevant, as many sPLA2 inhibitors are now under advanced investigation and carry different inhibitory potency against the four described subtypes [11] .

Since CBS was carried out at the same phospholipid concentration, it is the quality of surfactant that seems to be affected in ARDS. This qualitative alteration has been already described in adult ARDS patients [39] and may be related to the activity of the various sPLA2 subclasses secreted into the alveoli. Concomitantly, the presence of other inflammatory proteins and higher amounts of neutral lipids may also be partially responsible for surfactant alteration [40, 41] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 540, "end": 544, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 795, "end": 799, "text": "[40,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 800, "end": 803, "text": "41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Biochemical and biophysical effect of sPLA2"}, {"text": "Increased surface tension at the end of the compression has already been described in adult ARDS and supposed to cause atelectasis and lung collapse [42] .

The latter two have been linked with sPLA2 in animal studies and in adults with ARDS [3] [4] [5] [6] . Interestingly, not only surface tension, but also FFA, correlate with these physiopathologic variables. It has been demonstrated that the two products of sPLA2 reaction, lysophospholipids and FFA, are potent inhibitors of surfactant biophysical activity [42] . Conversely, FFA are precursors of various proinflammatory mediators: thus, the effect on lung compliance and oxygenation may be not only due to the direct lypolitic activity of sPLA2 on surfactant phospholipids, but also to lysophospholipids and FFA inhibiting the remaining surfactant and to the additional contribution of other FFA-derived inflammatory molecules. Consistently, the Murray's lung injury score, that globally describe the clinical severity (taking into accout Crs, oxygenation deficit, and other variables), also correlates with both surface tension and FFA. We must admit that correlations shown in Table 2 are statistically significant but lower than others, thus a strong and direct relationship cannot be assumed just from these findings.

It is also possible that mechanical ventilation might induce an inhibitory effect, both in controls and in ARDS patients, affecting the minimal tension reached by the relatively diluted concentrations of surfactant tested here. Finally, it is also conceivable that differences in minimal tensions between controls and ARDS patients could be maximized if tested at higher surfactant concentrations.

Our population mortality is consistent with other reports [7] . Since pediatric ARDS has a relatively low incidence and mortality, this latter is not a feasible clinical endpoint, while shorter respiratory support is an accepted alternative outcome resulting from decreasing inflammation [7] . Similarly, PICU stay is an alternative, as it may impact on mortality through the increased risk of nosocomial infections and on the general burden of care. sPLA2 activity is also correlated with the PRISM-III 24 and its predicted mortality. Similar correlation with predicted mortality was described in adults using a different score commonly applied in adult critical care [6] . About 30% to 40% of PICUs worldwide are using HFOV as rescue method for respiratory support in children unresponding to conventional ventilation [7] and since we have a strict protocol for rescue HFOV, we were able to analyze this as a secondary additional outcome. Consistently with the other findings, babies needing HFOV turned out to have higher sPLA2 levels.
