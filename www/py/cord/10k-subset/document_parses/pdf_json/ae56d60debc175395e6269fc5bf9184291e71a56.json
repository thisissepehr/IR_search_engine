Methods: This was a multicenter study on consecutive patients who underwent ECMO across 16 hospitals in Korea. The records of all patients who required ECMO for acute respiratory failure between 2012 and 2015 were retrospectively reviewed, and the utilization of ECMO was analyzed over time.",

We analyzed 487 (19.7%) patients who received ECMO for respiratory failure. The number of ECMO procedures provided for respiratory failure increased from 104 to 153 during the study period. The in-hospital survival rate increased from 30.8% to 35.9%. The use of prone positioning increased from 6.8% to 49.0% (p < 0.001), and the use of neuromuscular blockers also increased from 28.2% to 58.2% (p < 0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed that old age (OR 1.038 (95% CI 1.022, 1.054)), use of corticosteroid (OR 2.251 (95% CI 1.153, 4.397)), continuous renal replacement therapy (OR 2.196 (95% CI 1.135, 4.247)), driving pressure (OR 1.072 (95% CI 1.031, 1.114)), and prolonged ECMO duration (OR 1.020 (95% CI 1.003, 1.038)) were associated with increased odds of mortality. Conclusions: Utilization of ECMO and survival rates of patients who received ECMO for respiratory failure increased over time in Korea. The use of pre-ECMO prone positioning and neuromuscular blockers also increased during the same period.",

The use of ECMO to support patients with respiratory failure is increasing worldwide following the use of ECMO for severe acute respiratory failure during the 2009 influenza A pandemic [2] [3] [4] [5] . Recently, the EOLIA trial reported that in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) there was no significant difference in 60-day mortality between patients who received early ECMO and those who received conventional mechanical ventilation that included ECMO as rescue therapy [6] . However, crossover to ECMO occurred in 28% of patients in the conventional group, who showed a high mortality rate of 57%. This suggests that ECMO can be used in severe ARDS patients who do not benefit from conventional treatment.",

A recent epidemiologic report in Germany showed that ECMO utilization for severe respiratory failure significantly increased from 2007 until 2012, and in-hospital survival increased over time as well [8] . Sauer et al. [9] reported that the annual rates of ECMO cases increased by 433% from 2006 to 2011 in the United States, and that, albeit not statistically significant, there was an improving trend in the survival rate as well. In a single-center study in Korea, the survival rates associated with the ECMO procedure increased between 2009 and 2011 [10] . However, as we have previously reported, there was a discrepancy in the survival rate between those of the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) registry and Korean ECMO patients [11] . The in-hospital survival rate of ECMOtreated patients with acute respiratory failure was 46% from 2014 to 2015 in Korea, whereas the survival rate was 58% in the ELSO registry patients [7] . Also, we have suggested that age is an important factor in the survival of patients who received ECMO. Therefore, we sought to determine whether there has been an improvement in the survival rate of patients who received ECMO support for acute respiratory failure in Korea. Specifically, we evaluated the changes over time in the survival rates of patients supported with ECMO for severe respiratory failure and the factors associated with the survival rate.",

Immunocompromised status and CNS dysfunction were defined according to the RESP study [12] . Immunocompromised status included hematological malignancies, solid tumors, solid-organ transplantation, high-dose or long-term corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressant use, and human immunodeficiency virus infection. CNS dysfunction included diagnoses of neurotrauma, stroke, encephalopathy, cerebral embolism, seizure, and epileptic syndrome. We collected information on adjunctive therapy such as the use of vasopressors, steroids, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), prone positioning, nitric oxide, bicarbonate infusion, and neuromuscular blockers. We also collected data such as the ECMO mode, ECMO duration, duration of mechanical ventilation to ECMO initiation, hospital stay, and tracheotomy. The ECMO mode was categorized as veno-venous, veno-arterial, and veno-arteriovenous. Outcome variables of the study were survival at discharge and ECMO weaning (survival within 48 h after weaning from ECMO).",

Papazian et al. [13] reported that early use of neuromuscular blockades in patients with severe ARDS may improve survival. In the ELSO registry-based RESP study, neuromuscular blockade agents before ECMO were independently associated with hospital survival [12] . In addition, in patients with severe ARDS, early application of prolonged prone positioning was significantly associated with improved survival [14] . Schmidt et al. [15] demonstrated that use of prone positioning before ECMO was also associated with survival. These results are in accordance with those in a recent systematic review and meta-analysis [16] . Moreover, for patients with severe ARDS, prone positioning before and during ECMO may be helpful for weaning from ECMO [17, 18] . Another distinctive finding was the change in pre-ECMO ventilator parameters. In recent years, the driving pressure was lower and minute ventilation was decreased. Therefore, improvement in hospital survival of ECMO-supported patients with respiratory failure might be the result of increasing experience with ECMO over time, including evolving adjuvant therapies and improved management of mechanical ventilation.",

The overall survival rate of 39% in \"CNS dysfunction\" included diagnoses of neurotrauma, stroke, encephalopathy, cerebral embolism, seizure, and epileptic syndrome ECMO-supported respiratory failure patients in Korea is lower than the reported rate of 58% in the ELSO registry [7] . Meanwhile, an ECMO epidemiologic study performed in Germany reported that from 2012 to 2014 the in-hospital survival had steadily increased and the rate of survival was approximately 40%, which is similar to our findings [8] . In addition, Sauer et al. [9] reported that in the United States the survival rate of the patients who received ECMO was approximately 40%. In the German study, approximately 80% of patients were older than 40 years and increasing numbers of older patients had received ECMO. In the US study, the mean age of the patients who received ECMO was 50 years, which is higher than that of the patients included in the ELSO registry. Taken together, the discrepancies in demographics between the patients of ECMO centers not included in the ELSO and those in the ELSO registry may explain the difference in survival rates. Also, another explanation for the relatively low survival rate of Korean ECMO patients could be the infrequent use of prone positioning. The use of prone positioning and use of neuromuscular blockers were low compared with those in the EOLIA trial [6] , in which prone positioning was applied in 90% of patients in the conventional ventilator support group, who showed a 54% survival rate. The relatively low survival rate in Korean ECMO patients may be due to excessive use of ECMO in patients who may have shown good response to prone positioning. Accordingly, the use of prone positioning is gradually increasing in Korea.",

The survival rate of patients who required prolonged ECMO (longer than 14 days) was significantly lower than that of patients who had shorter ECMO duration (28% vs 43%, respectively, p = 0.001). Recently, Posluszny et al. [19] reported that ECMO duration was inversely correlated with the survival rate in ECMO-supported patients with respiratory failure; the survival rate in patients who had longer ECMO duration was 10% lower than that in those with shorter ECMO duration. Nonetheless, the investigators suggested that prolonged ECMO was not futile because there was a significant improvement in survival from 37% to 49% in recent years. On the other hand, the aforementioned German epidemiologic study reported that prolonged ECMO was associated with poorer outcome; that the survival rate rapidly declined to 20% within 10 days after ECMO initiation [8] . Therefore, further studies are needed to provide a more solid association between ECMO duration and the survival rate.",
