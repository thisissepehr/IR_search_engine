Chest X-ray ( Figure 1 ) taken at this time showed diffuse fluffy opacities involving both lung fields and pleural effusions on both sides. His central venous pressure (CVP) varied between 3 and 11 cm of water. The patient was immediately started on piperacillin/gentamicin/vancomycin after appropriate cultures had been taken. These were sterile. His C-reactive protein (CRP) level in the serum was persistently normal at less than 14 U/l (NR 14-90 U/l). We attempted continuous positive airway pressure respiration (CPAP) with high oxygen flow (10 l/min) via a sealed facial mask and a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cm of water. He was not able to tolerate this and hence we switched to intermittent CPAP, ie positive and expiratory pressure for 5 min every 30 min with continuous high oxygen flow (10 l/min). The patient was able to tolerate this and maintained an oxygen saturation of 85-92% over the subsequent 3-4 days. He remained afebrile with a tachypnoea (40-60 min) and tachycardia (140-160/min). To reduce the regimen-related lung toxicity he was started on methylprednisolone 0.5 mg/kg/i.v. twice daily, with strict fluid balance and blood pressure control. Within 24 h of developing pulmonary toxicity he developed VOD of liver with serum bilirubins reaching 88 mol/l (NR \u03fd17 mol/l), hypoalbuminaemia (26 g/l), fluid retention (3 kg) and tender hepatomegaly (10-12 cm below the costal margin) and greenish diarrhoea. The VOD responded to a combination of low molecular weight heparin, dopamine infusion, diuretics, slow infusion of 20% albumin and fresh frozen plasma. The right-sided pleural aspiration was tapped and 40 ml of straw coloured fluid was obtained. This was found to be a transudate and was sterile on culture. Although only 40 ml fluid was aspirated the oxygen saturation improved immediately from 89-92% to 97-100%. On this intermittent CPAP the patient steadily improved, received his allogeneic marrow graft from his brother engrafting by day +9. His peak expiratory flow rate improved steadily from 150 l/min in the acute stage to 375 l/min which was his pre-transplant value.",

This was also corroborated by the sterile cultures. Damage to the pulmonary microvasculature with ALG and cyclophosphamide, and the associated hypoalbuminaemia could have contributed to the respiratory distress by increasing interstitial water in the presence of normal or mildly increased central venous pressure. Concomitant development of VOD of the liver and gastrointestinal toxicity strongly suggest that conditioning regimen-related lung toxicity was the major cause of lung injury in this case.",
