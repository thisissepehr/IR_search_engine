The high incidence of treatment-related mortality and relapses, however, are important reasons for controversy about the role of allografting in the management of MM. We reviewed our results of allografting for MM spanning a period of 34 years in order to better define long-term outcomes and identify areas of progress as well as areas requiring improvement. A total of 278 patients received allogeneic marrow or PBSCs after high-dose myeloablative (N \u00bc 144) or reduced intensity, non-myeloablative (N \u00bc 134) regimens. In multivariable analysis, adjusting for differences in patient groups, reduced intensity/non-myeloablative transplants were associated with significantly less acute GVHD, lower transplant mortality, better PFS and overall survival. There were no significant differences in relapse, progression or chronic GVHD, when adjusted. In multivariable analysis of patients receiving only non-myeloablative transplants, decreased overall survival and PFS were associated with relapse after a prior autograft and a b2 microglobulin 44.0.

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is currently one treatment with a potential for long-term disease control although its curative potential is debated. This is in part due to the graft-vs-myeloma effect, mediated by immune competent donor lymphocytes, best illustrated by the induction of sustained (molecular) remissions following donor lymphocyte infusions, 8 but could also be due in part to absence of contaminating myeloma cells in the donor graft and documented lower levels of residual disease. 9, 10 The role of allo-SCT in MM, however, is controversial due to the high mortality and morbidity associated with conventional myeloablative regimens and because convincing evidence for a survival benefit is lacking. 11 --13 In the last decade, non-myeloablative allo-SCT has gained in popularity due to significantly reduced TRM. 14, 15 Among four reports comparing auto-SCT with allo-SCT, two have shown survival advantages for the nonmyeloablative approach when compared with tandem autologous transplantation. 16 --19 A recently reported US clinical trial prospectively comparing tandem autologous transplant to autologous followed by non-myeloablative allo-SCTs found no differences in PFS or OS at 3 years. 20 In contrast, a European multicenter trial found than tandem autologous, non-myeloablative allo-SCT resulted in superior OS compared with single or tandem auto-SCT. 19 Furthermore, at least one registry report comparing conventional ablative with non-myeloabalative/reduced intensity allo-SCTs have shown similar survival outcomes with lower TRM for patients receiving non-ablative transplants yet higher rates of relapse and PFS inferior to ablative allo-SCT. 21 We reviewed our results of allo-SCT for patients with MM beginning in 1975 with the aim of identifying factors associated with improvements in disease-free survival and OS as preparative regimens have changed from ablative to non-myeloablative.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 295, "end": 300, "text": "1 --6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 455, "end": 456, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 957, "end": 958, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1099, "end": 1101, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1102, "end": 1104, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1318, "end": 1325, "text": "11 --13", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1432, "end": 1435, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1436, "end": 1438, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1615, "end": 1622, "text": "16 --19", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1814, "end": 1816, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1981, "end": 1983, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2277, "end": 2279, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Beginning in 1975, patients with MM were referred to the University of Washington, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center or the Seattle Veterans Hospital for consideration of allo-SCT.
