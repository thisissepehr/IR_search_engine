Methods: Human mast cells were enzymatically dispersed from tonsil and skin tissues. The dispersed cells were then cultured with various stimuli, and tryptase and histamine levels in cell supernatants collected from challenge tubes were measured. Results: PAR-2 agonist peptide SLIGKV provoked a dose-dependent release of histamine from skin mast cells. It also induced tryptase release from tonsil mast cells. tc-LIGRLO appeared less potent than SLIGKV in induction of release of histamine and tryptase. Trypsin was able to induce a \"bell\" shape increase in tryptase release from tonsil mast cells. It was also able to induce a dose-dependent release of histamine from both tonsil and skin mast cells. The actions of trypsin on mast cells were inhibited by soy bean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) or \u03b1 1 -antitrypsin (\u03b1 1 -AT). Time course study revealed that both stimulated tryptase or histamine release initiated within 10 s and reached their peak release between 4 and 6 min.

This was particularly important when tryptase and histamine, the two major mast cell mediators were investigated in parallel in the same experiments, which not only proved that the quantities of the two mediators released from mast cells were in an inconstant ratio, but also revealed that the pace of release was different between histamine and tryptase upon mast cell degranulation. These phenomena were similar to our previous findings with human colon mast cells [12] . Trypsin at 1 mg/L was able to stimulate the maximum tryptase release (19.4%), but not significant histamine release from tonsil mast cells. In contrast, trypsin at 100 mg/L was able to stimulate 16.4% histamine release, but not significant tryptase release from tonsil mast cells. These are surprising observations, which suggests strongly that tryptase and histamine release from tonsil mast cells induced by trypsin may be involved in different mechanisms. Since anti-IgE and CI also showed \"bell\" shape tryptase release and dose-dependent histamine release patterns in the same experimental system, these observations may reflect a common phenomenon of tonsil mast cell degranulation. It is most likely that tryptase release pathway of tonsil mast cells has the ability to prevent itself from strong stimulation. However, more experiments are needed to prove this. In contrast to mast cells from tonsil, mast cells from skin released only histamine, but not tryptase in response to trypsin, which indicated further that tryptase and histamine release from human mast cells induced by trypsin was through different mechanisms. The difference in the ability of trypsin inhibitors to inhibit trypsin induced histamine release (up to 82.4%) and tryptase release (up to 65%) may also suggest the different mechanisms involved in tryptase and histamine release from tonsil mast cells.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 562, "end": 566, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Moreover, PAR-2 agonist peptides SLIGKV and tc-LIGRLO showed different effects on tryptase and histamine release from mast cells.

The extent of histamine release induced by SLIGKV was similar to that induced by trypsin, indicating that the actions of trypsin on skin mast cells may be through PAR-2. Because VKGILS (a reversed peptide of SLIGKV) had little effect on tryptase and histamine release from skin mast cells, the action of SLIGKV on skin mast cells was a specific one. Different from skin mast cells, tonsil mast cells released tryptase but not histamine in response to SLIGKV. This suggested that trypsin induced histamine release from tonsil mast cells might not be through a PAR-2 related mechanism. It suggested also that release of tryptase and histamine from tonsil mast cells upon stimulation might not occur simultaneously. Another PAR-2 agonist peptide tc-LIGRLO had a similar effect to SLIGKV on skin mast cells, confirming further the functional expression of PAR-2 on these cells. Interestingly, tc-OLRGIL a reversed peptide of tc-LIGRLO appeared a potent stimulus of histamine release from skin mast cells, and a secretagogue of tryptase release from tonsil mast cells. The physiological or pathophysiological meaning of the action of tc-OLRGIL on mast cells requires further investigation to be understood. Consistent with our previous findings [14, 15] , histamine exhibited its ability to stimulate tryptase release from tonsil mast cells, and tryptase showed its ability to provoke histamine release from mast cells.
