General-population antibody titers against subtype H7 virus are higher than antibody titers against subtype H5 and lower than titers against H9. The highest titers were observed for human influenza virus subtypes. Titers to avian influenza virus antigens increased with age and with geometric mean antibody titer to human influenza virus antigens.

Not every cross-species jump causes an influenza pandemic, as seen by the differences last decade between the sporadic outbreaks of influenza A/H5N1 and the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic, which spread worldwide in a matter of weeks. The current outbreak of subtype A/H7N9 human cases in China [1, 2] , with 130 cases confirmed in <3 months and no confirmation yet of human-to-human transmission, appears to be more transmissible from poultry to humans than H5N1 but does not yet resemble the transmission patterns of the 2009 pandemic. In any of these epidemiological scenarios, key clinical and epidemiological features are difficult to determine during the early outbreak or epidemic phase, and for this reason pandemic preparedness plans have been put into place globally in an attempt to mitigate or slow down the first stages of the epidemic and to gather early data.",

Ho Chi Minh City is a densely populated major urban center with an official population of 7.5 million inhabitants. Nha Trang, with a population of 400 000, is the capital of Khanh Hoa province, and the Khanh Hoa Provincial Hospital serves the city of Nha Trang, as well as the surrounding rural areas. Anonymized and unlinked residual serum samples are collected in both hospitals from routine biochemistry and hematology analysis for the purpose of measuring influenza virus antibody titers. The serum samples are intended to represent the general population in each hospital's catchment region, as presentation to the hospital should not be correlated with history of influenza virus infection. Seasonal influenza vaccination in Vietnam is uncommon and therefore unlikely to influence antibody levels. The research protocol was approved by the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee at the University of Oxford and by the Scientific and Ethical Committee of the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City.",

One of the 5 avian influenza virus antigens was that of the A/Chicken/Netherlands/1/2003 (H7N7) virus, whose HA1 protein shares 96% homology with the HA1 of the earliest H7N9 strains sequenced in China (A/Shanghai/ 2/2013 and A/Anhui/1/2013 [1] ). Only 10 amino acid positions differed between these 2 strains: V38I, T112A, D165N, I170V, T180A, I193V, I227M, E261G, N289D, and E303R (HA numbering as in [2] ). The last 2 positions do not appear to be in regions associated with binding of virus-neutralizing antibodies, and the remaining changes are largely conservative, but it is difficult to describe the antigenic characteristics of the viruses on the basis of the mutations alone. Nevertheless, the high level of homology makes it likely that there would be substantial serological cross-reaction between the HAs from these 2 viruses.",

Antibody titer measurements are continuous in this type of analysis and can fall anywhere between 20 and 1280. Titer measurements that fall outside this range were given scores of 10 and 1810.

Geometric mean titers (GMTs) were 23.1 for H9 (95% confidence interval [CI], 21.8-24.4), 19.0 for H7 (95% CI, 18.1-20.0), 13.5 for both H5/10 and H5/07 (95% CI, 13.1-13.9), and 11.1 for H5/04 (95% CI, 10.9-11.3), while GMTs for human influenza virus antigens ranged from 60 to 200. This indicates that immunity to subtype H7 viruses should be low and comparable to that for other avian influenza viruses. The microarray assay is more sensitive than HI or microneutralization tests, but it has not yet been determined whether the binding differences observed among H5, H7, and H9 translate to differences in clinical protection. Because titers calculated from our assay are not directly comparable to HI or microneutralization tests, no cutoff is chosen to represent positivity or clinical protection. It is not possible to associate these titers with past exposure or past infection, as serological assays have not yet been validated for H7N9. On the basis of comparison of the H7 GMT with that of other antigens on the array, it is reasonable to assume that past exposure to avian H7 viruses is similar to past exposure to other avian influenza viruses. Figure 1 shows quantile-quantile plots for the entire titer distributions, as well as their top quartiles; top quartiles are shown because the majority of titers for each antigen were equal to 10 and the upper end of each distribution showed the most variation. Pair-wise differences between distributions were significant by both the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test (all P values were < 10 \u22125 ), except for the comparison between H5/07 and H5/10, whose titer distributions were very similar. These relative titers among H9, H7, and H5 are consistent with some [6, 7] but not all [8, 9] past serological investigation in various study populations.",

The value of comparing antibody titers across antigens in a potentially prepandemic scenario is that it may alert us to a particularly dangerous situation in which cross-reactive antibodies to an emerging virus are lower than we expected; this would have been the case if H7-binding had been weaker than H5-binding in our assays. With pandemic preparedness in mind, antigen-antigen comparisons can also be used to prioritize vaccine development for H7 viruses over H9 viruses, if the higher titers to H9 can be correlated to some level of clinical protection. Comparing antibody titers across age groups can be useful for pandemic response, although these results will not always be available in time, as was the case in 2009 [13] .",

If the current belief holds that influenza viruses circulate and mix globally in short periods (as suggested by Bahl et al [14] and in articles they cite), then the immunological landscapes constructed by influenza epidemics should be similar across countries. Taking national vaccination patterns into account [15] , serological studies from a limited number of sites could be used to inform the global response. If a coordinated research response involving serological analysis is perceived as too difficult logistically or scientifically, a simpler solution may be to preempt this need by maintaining recent serum collections that are either tested or ready for testing for a broad class of important pathogens.",

The 10 subplots in the lower-right part of the graph show quantile-quantile plots of the top quartile of individuals (n = 431) with the highest geometric mean antibody titers across the 5 avian influenza virus antigens. All pair-wise distribution comparisons show that the distributions are statistically significantly different (all P values are < 10 \u22125 , by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests), except for the 2 panels marked \"NS\" (ie, not significant). Antigen abbreviations are A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5/04), A/Cambodia/R0405050/2007 (H5/07), A/Hubei/1/2010 (H5/10), A/ Chicken/Netherlands/1/2003 (H7), and A/Guinea Fowl/Hong Kong/WF10/1999 (H9).",
