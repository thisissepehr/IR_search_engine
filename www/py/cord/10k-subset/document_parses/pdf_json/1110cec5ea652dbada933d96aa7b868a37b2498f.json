For example, the successful R&D for the Ebola vaccine in China was developed by China's Academy of Military Medical Sciences, along with CanSino Biotech. However, PPP is still limitedly seen, especially for developing EID related countermeasures. Reasons might include limited incentives or support for academic institutions to transform research into products, as well as limited market incentives for private industries to invest in product development, especially when the development process requires international coordination. Our study showed that China spent nearly a year to complete the preparation for overseas clinical trials. Though the Chinese government has shown strong support for coordinating this overseas clinical trial, more mature clinical research partnerships should be established, like the Partnership for Research on Ebola Vaccines in Liberia initiated by NIAID [32] .

Comparing with the standard 150 workdays' time frame in China, the approval for Ebola vaccine only took 83 workdays, setting a new time record for New Drug Application approval at that time. Drug approval regulations might turn out to be a sufficient incentive for products without market returns.
