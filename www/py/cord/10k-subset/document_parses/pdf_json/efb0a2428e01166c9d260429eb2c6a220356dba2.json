Therefore, the food becomes an important vehicle for many, but not all, of these zoonotic pathogens. One of the major issues in food safety over the latest decennia has been the lack of cross-sectoral collaboration across the food production chain. Major food safety events have been significantly affected by the lack of collaboration between the animal health, the food control, and the human health sector. Examples range from BSE and E. coli outbreaks over dioxin crises to intentional melamine contamination. One Health formulates clearly both the need for and the benefit of cross-sectoral collaboration. In this chapter, we will focus on the human health risk related to zoonotic microorganisms present both in food animals and food from these animals, and typically transmitted to humans through food. We focus on these issues because they are very important in relation to the human disease burden, but also because this is the area where some experience of crosssectoral collaboration already exist. Food related zoonoses can be separated in three major classes: parasites, bacteria, and viruses. While parasites often relate to very specific animal hosts and contribute significantly to the human disease burden, virus have often been related to major, well-published global outbreaks, e.g. SARS and avian-and swine-influenza. The bacterial zoonoses on the other hand often result in sporadic, but very wide-spread disease cases, resulting in a major",

Already in ancient times it was understood that humans could get sick from consumption of infected meat, and that keeping your animals healthy improved your own health. Our current health situation has much improved, simply by keeping animals healthy through good management and hygiene, vaccination programs and prudent drug treatment. Nevertheless, there are still many zoonotic diseases that threaten human health, including diseases hosted by all kinds of animals, ranging from wildlife to domestic animals, whether in companionship-or agricultural setting. Given the large amount and the obvious close contact we have with animals by raising/hunting, slaughtering, and eating them or their products (e.g. milk, eggs), food animals and wildlife form the largest reservoirs and production grounds for emerging zoonotic pathogens. Caused to some degree by our modern animal production methods, we now increasingly use antibiotics also in animal production, both for treatment and for growth promotion, thereby contributing significantly to the occurrence of an emerging risk: Anti Microbial Resistant (AMR) bacteria.",

Other diseases relate to the industrialized food production chain and are broadly distributed in all such production systems, which are found in all countries, rich or poor. The prevention of these diseases need to be considered along the full production chain, but most countries have yet to deal efficiently with these zoonoses, including pathogens such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. Finally, an important group of zoonotic diseases have been eradicated or drastically reduced in affluent economies through vaccination and culling policies or through introduction of hygienic management practices. In most poor settings these diseases are 'neglected diseases' which receive very little attention from national authorities or even international organizations.

The vast majority of infections with enteric zoonotic bacterial pathogens, such as Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter coli/jejuni, and Yersinia enterocolitica, probably occurs through this route. For other zoonotic pathogens, direct contact between animals and humans may also be an important route of transmission, this could be the case for Brucella spp., Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) or some newer strains of Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Bacteria from production animals are widespread in the environment, mainly as a result of their presence in manure. Thus, the environment and wild fauna also transforms into reservoirs of foodborne pathogens and resistance, and forms a source of (resistant) pathogenic bacteria into the food animals and human reservoirs. Although consumption of wildlife is not considered a major route in many developed countries, wildlife is consumed at a substantial level in developing countries. In addition, because of generally lower bio-safety levels in rural animal keeping, contact between humans and food animals may in general be more frequent in these countries. For instance, the general understanding now is that the SARS epidemic in 2003 originated in direct human contact with and/ or consumption of, wildlife, or indirectly through contact between wildlife and domestic animals (Guan et al. 2003; Shi and Hu 2008) . Wildlife holds a broad spectrum of diseases including some of the most deadly ones. For this reason also the consumption of wildlife animals, and the spillover of infectious diseases from wildlife to food/production animal, is of global importance. Fig. 1 Schematic presentation of important microbial transmission routes via which the human and (food) animals are in contact with each other. In blue control mechanisms are shown and in red some of the transmission routes that cannot be controlled, or escape control. Via the environment transmission may take place, through microbes present in excretion products and diseased animals, and in some countries also diseased humans. Next to the animals that are produced for direct consumption, in many developing countries animals are used as working animals to produce food and are thus included in this scheme. in these scheme. These animals when old or ill are often consumed (red dashed line), rather than destructed. Wildlife holds a broad spectrum of diseases including many highly pathogenic and deadly diseases. Though, the incidence may be low, because the associated risks are high, the consumption of wildlife animals and the spillover from wildlife to food/production animal is of importance. In Western countries wildlife is of lesser importance, however, in many developing countries and upcoming economies wildlife consumption may still be substantial, for instance in rural areas because of availability, as delicacies or other reasons. Moreover, in developing countries contact between humans and food animals may in general be easier and more frequent",

These zoonotic, global influenza outbreaks (H1N1 even characterized by WHO as a pandemic) spread very quickly either in the animals (H5N1) or directly in the human population (H1N1). Although the total human disease burden related to the endemic bacterial zoonoses are probably manifold higher than these influenza outbreaks, it is basically these relatively few (but clearly global) outbreaks that have put One Health on the global agenda. The failure to predict or even monitor disease spread in animals in order to link this to the prevention of disease in humans, presented regulators, and politician with a wake-up call regarding the need for cross-sectoral collaboration between the animal and human health sectors.",

            "text": "In contrast to the dramatic viral outbreaks, bacterial food-related zoonoses are usually occurring endemically in farm animals. These pathogens are found in most food animals produced in industrialized settings. It should be realized that most countries-including most developing countries-have a significant part of the food animal production in some sort of industrialized setting. Such settings are invariably linked to a number of important zoonotic pathogens, including Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Escherichia coli. These pathogens, while widespread and endemic and in reality causing a major global disease burden, are not often recognized as important human pathogens. Part of the reason for this is the absence of a One Health framework, a framework that could ensure crosssectoral collaboration and data-sharing and thereby lay the foundation for a realistic description of the situation, as well as, of potential sensible solutions. There are some countries (especially in northern Europe) that have instituted crosssectoral data collection for zoonoses, typically through a construction called Zoonosis Centers. The data sharing across animal, food, and human health sectors have enabled science-based solutions, resulting most noticeably in significant reduction in human salmonellosis through lowering Salmonella prevalence in animals (Wegener et al. 2003) . These constructions and solutions are clearly following One Health principles, and have basically done so since 1994! Similar solutions would be relevant in all countries with industrialized food animal production, but it is noteworthy that efficient solutions in this (sometimes called commercial) part of a national production system often will have repercussions also down to the traditional poor farmer (sometimes referred to as the communal production system). For instance, Salmonella enteritidis entered Zimbabwe through imported animals (poultry) in the commercial sector around 1993, and thereafter spread quickly to the communal sector, as well as, to the human population (Matope et al. 1998 ). The background for this is most likely that old animals from the commercial sector are sold to communal production systems. And where the animal goes the pathogen goes-therefore lowering the prevalence in the commercial sector would enable a reduction in prevalence also in the communal sector, thereby in turn lowering the human incidence of disease.",

This also affects the potential mitigation action; for instance the large-scale culling of animals, which can be a viable solution in rich countries, might be problematic in the poorest countries.

The mechanism by which this works was (and still is) unclear, nevertheless, this type of antibiotic use led to a steep increase in antibiotic consumption when it was introduced. In general, when first introduced, the use of antibiotics led to improved animal health and most likely to higher levels of both food safety and food security. The use of antibiotics therefore sky-rocketed. Between 1951 and 1978, the use in the United States alone went from 110 to 5580 tons (WHO 2011).",

Nowadays, there are serious efforts by national authorities and some international organizations to reduce the antibiotic overuse in animal production (WHO 2011; FAO/OIE/WHO 2003), especially-but not onlythrough abolishing their use as AGP. However, there seems to be major problems in ensuring cross-sectoral understanding, and indeed cross-sectoral solutions in this area. The veterinary profession and the medical profession is seen as accusing each other of AMR problems, and in a sense they are both right-all use of antimicrobials can cause AMR, therefore both animal and human use cause problems. But in order to achieve a science-based understanding of the problem, we need data on both animal and human uses, and about both AMR in bacteria in animals, in food, and in humans. Therefore, a One Health approach in which all stakeholders work together will be necessary to investigate the problems and provide science-based solutions that can efficiently reduce the spread of AMR bacteria from animals to humans (most often through food) and vice versa (most often through the environment).",

Food we eat today could have come from animals raised yesterday, thousands of miles away. To combat zoonotic foodborne zoonoses we need improvements and adjustments in our food production systems based on a global vision and approach. Internationally, different organizations have recognized that combating zoonoses is best done via a One Health approach. The World Health Organization (WHO), the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), agreed a seminal paper: 'A Tripartite Concept Note' (FAO/OIE/WHO 2011) in which they express the need to collaborate for a common vision. Given the impact zoonotic disease have in particular on the most vulnerable sectors in our societies, the World Bank and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), as well as, the United Nations System Influenza Coordinator (UNSIC), share this One Health strategy to combat zoonotic disease (UN 2008). A One Health approach will open solution scenarios that are now not considered for treatment of the zoonoses problems because of the costs involved. For instance, while vaccination in some cases is the ultimate tool to prevent disease, it is often not considered because the costs of mass vaccination can be much higher than the public health benefit savings. Getting a true picture of the cost for the different stakeholders and setting up a framework for sharing of estimates of cost, as well as, mitigation strategies could likely enable (new) ways of reaching sensible solutions (Narrod et al. 2012) . While collaboration and control at the international level can help prevent the global spread of zoonotic disease and facilitate outbreak control at national levels, this is not enough. Many countries have established specialized infectious diseaseor zoonosis centers in which zoonotic disease in particular are the focus of the work, and which help to establish and coordinate collaboration between the different sectors. Many of these work centers and these initiatives do focus on zoonoses originating from food animals, both from animals kept in industrialized settings and wildlife animals.",

One of the findings from DANMAP was that data on drug usage are essential for a good understanding of the problem. In Denmark, an automated program called Vetstat has been introduced to collect quantitative data on all prescribed medicine for animals from veterinarians, pharmacies, and feed mills (Stege et al. 2003) . With this information, it has been possible for the Danish Veterinary and Food Authority (DVFA) to introduce ''The Yellow Card Initiative'' (DVFA 2012) . Like in a football match, farmers and veterinarians get a card when their antimicrobial use is excessive, and only by reducing the antibiotic use (for instance, by adopting management methods from low users) they can lose the card. This does not only work as a stick, it also gives the users a sense of how well they are doing compared to their colleagues. In the European Union, several countries now have started to collect similar data to compare antibiotic use at country level (EMA 2011).",

Such a database is needed and should be open to, and supported by, scientists from all fields: human health, animal health, and food safety, and should include genomic data for all types of microorganisms as well as meta-data to trace back the source of the microorganism. Building such a database is only possible through a One Health approach on all levels. There should be cooperation internationally, across sectors (e.g. human, animal, and food), as well as, between different stakeholders. Persuing such a major goal will not only be beneficial for the developed world, but maybe especially for developing countries. For them, genomic identification will be a giant leap forward in the fight against infectious diseases, and could be likened to the spread of cell phones, which made expensive and exclusive landlines unnecessary and made communication possible for everybody. Identification and typing of microorganisms will suddenly become technically and economically feasible, enabling control and prevention efforts previously missing in many regions. At the same time, developing countries moving to use this technology will not need to develop expensive specialized lab systems since microbiological lab work will basically be the same for bacteria, parasites, and viruses.

At the transmission level, it will be of major importance to involve food and consumers authorities and related stakeholders to make sure the spillover from the animal reservoir is kept as low as possible.",

            "text": "The level of involvement of the different stakeholders will differ per country or type of disease. Given that 70 % of the rural population in poor countries is dependent on livestock and working animals to survive, the effect of these animals carrying a zoonosis will work out differently than in the industrialized countries. It is important to realize that the focus on zoonotic pathogens with a potential for dramatic global spread (such as avian influenza) is significantly higher than the focus on endemic zoonotic pathogens in the food production chain, even though such pathogens are globally distributed and cause a dramatic disease burden (e.g. Salmonella). And it is as important to realize that a number of the most important zoonoses relate directly to food production systems in poor settings, that could be reduced dramatically through well-known interventions (such as Brucella, bovine TB, and cysticercosis).",
