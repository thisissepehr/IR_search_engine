Rapid sustained engraftment in 20 of 22 evaluable children proved that engraftment was not a problem, similar to results in other studies. 14, 15, 17, 22 Factors possibly predicting a relapse, as found by us and by others, relate to karyotype, 14 intensive pre-BMT chemotherapy, conditioning regimen, 11, 22 donor type, 11 TCD and GvHD. 15 Manabe et al 14 found in a multivariate analysis on the outcome of 27 JMML patients an abnormal karyotype to be the only significant risk factor for decreased OS. 14 In our series, statistical significance was not reached due to limited power, but a trend towards worse outcome having an abnormal karyotype was noted. This observation needs to be confirmed with larger numbers. Intensive chemotherapy given before the start of the conditioning for BMT had a significant adverse effect (P \u00bc 0.04 in univariate analysis) in our study on the relapse rate after BMT. This finding is not in agreement with the findings of other authors 11, 14, 22 and needs further study. The influence of TBI in the conditioning regimen for JMML was studied by Matthes-Martin et al 22 in a single center evaluation of 11 transplants and a review of the literature on single center reports. The relapse rate was significantly higher in patients conditioned with a TBIcontaining regimen. In other series, 14,15 the outcome was comparable for both types of conditioning. Locatelli et al 11 found better EFS of 62% with the non-TBI regimen vs 11% with the TBI regimen for children with JMML given a BMT from an identical sibling or one-antigen-disparate relative. In our series, there is a trend towards a negative influence on EFS of the TBI-containing regimen. These combined data support the inferiority of the TBI regimen, but further study is needed to validate this finding. With regard to donor type, Locatelli et al 11 found EFS for all UD transplants of 22% vs EFS of 38% for all transplants with identical sibling or one-antigen mismatched family donors (Po0.05). Our results with transplants from fully matched unrelated donors (n \u00bc 4) are as good as those from sibling donors, similar to another reported series. 14 Smith et al 15 found significantly more relapses in using one-Ag mismatched unrelated marrows, but from his study this finding could not be associated with TCD. Using unrelated marrows, which were T-cell depleted because of one-Ag HLA disparity between donor and recipient, was the only factor in both univariate and multivariate analysis with a significant negative effect on EFS in our study. This suggests a possible graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect of allogeneic BMT in this disease.
