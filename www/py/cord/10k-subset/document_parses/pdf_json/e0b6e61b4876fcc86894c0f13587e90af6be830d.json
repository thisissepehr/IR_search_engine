Despite the concomitant improvements in response rate, duration of response and patient survival, reports of serious toxic pulmonary side effects have progressively emerged. Case presentation: We describe a patient who was treated with FOLFOX as an adjuvant to a rectosigmoidal resection of a rectosigmoidal carcinoma and who developed respiratory insufficiency requiring mechanical ventilation. Computed tomography (CT) imaging and open lung biopsy findings were compatible with interstitial pneumonia (IP). She received multimodal combination treatment (acetylcysteine, corticosteroids, immune globulins and cyclophosphamide) and survived. We performed a systematic literature search and reviewed all 45 reported cases of FOLFOX-related lung toxicity and/or pulmonary fibrosis for their clinical characteristics and their outcomes related to therapy. Conclusions: We found that for the 45 cases with available data, the median age was 70 years, and the male-female ratio was 3.5: 1. In the patients exhibiting only mild respiratory symptoms, discontinuation of the culprit drug (oxaliplatin) resulted in a 100% regression of the symptoms. However the prognosis of the respiratory insufficient patient proved to be grim: death occurred in 76.9% of the cases despite conventional treatment with corticosteroids. We therefore urge oncologists and critical care specialists not to limit their interventions to the discontinuation of chemotherapy, artificial ventilation, corticosteroids and glutathione replenishment and to consider the gradual introduction of additional immune-modulating agents whenever life-threatening respiratory symptoms in oxaliplatin-treated patients do not subside; all the more so considering the fact that our analysis showed that every patient who survived intubation and mechanical ventilation experienced a full clinical recovery.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Since the middle of the previous century, 5fluorouracil (5-FU) has been the cornerstone in the treatment of colorectal cancer. The initial addition of folinic acid (leucovorin) and subsequent addition of oxaliplatin (OX) resulted in improved response rates, longer remissions and an increase in patient survival [1, 2] . Subsequently, the combination of folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin, i.e., the so-called FOL-FOX regimen, became a well-established treatment for colorectal malignancy either as in monotherapy or as an adjuvant to surgery [1] . With the widespread use of this triple chemotherapeutic combination therapy, reports of increased toxicity (e.g., peripheral neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting) compared with the 5-FU/leucovorin treatment emerged [3] . Additionally, interstitial lung disease has been reported. In the majority of cases, the noxious pulmonary effects occur rather late in the course of therapy [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] , although there have been exceptions to this rule [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Although pulmonary toxicity in conjunction with FOLFOX therapy is uncommon (\u2264 1.5%) [15] , it can be lethal despite the immediate discontinuation of the chemotherapeutic drugs and the initiation of immunotherapy (i.e., corticosteroids).

CT examination of the lungs revealed extensive abnormalities in both lungs with diffuse ground glass abnormalities in both the upper (Fig. 1a) and lower lobes (Fig. 1b) and areas of consolidation at the level of the lower lobes (Fig. 1b) . Antibiotics were empirically prescribed (moxifloxacin) from day one. Hypoxic respiratory insufficiency arose and necessitated intubation 1 week after admission. Immediately thereafter, she was referred to our university hospital. On admission to our intensive care unit (ICU), 70% oxygen (PEEP 8 cm H 2 0) was needed to prevent frank hypoxemia. The serum white blood cell count amounted to 19 \u00d7 10 9 /L (the normal value is up to 10 \u00d7 10 9 /L). Predominantly, neutrophils (78.8%, 14.97 \u00d7 10 9 /L) and to a lesser extent lymphocytes (16.3%, 3.10 \u00d7 10 9 /L), were present. There was no peripheral eosinophilia. The Creactive protein (CRP) level was low (1.2 mg/dl), and there were no biochemical signs of other organ failure (i.e., serum creatinine 0.55 mg/dl). Fig. 1 axial CT images of the chest in the lung window setting at the levels of the upper lobes (images in a, c and e) and the lower lobes (images in b, d and f). CT examination at the time of diagnosis revealed extensive abnormalities in both lungs with diffuse ground glass abnormalities in both the upper (a) and lower lobes (b). Associated areas of consolidation at the lower lobe level were present. Follow-up images 11 weeks after multimodal therapy for ILD revealed a good resolution of the ground glass abnormalities and consolidation with only minor parenchymal changes in the upper lobes, some small foci of ground glass abnormalities and some parenchymal bands (c). In the lower lobes, the nodular area (d asterisk) was consistent with loculated postoperative fluid due to the open-lung biopsy. The most recent examination more than 4 years after the event (e, f) showed no abnormalities Shortly after admittance to our ICU, a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in the right middle lobe and revealed a white blood cell count of 44/m 3 that mostly consisted of neutrophils (90%) in addition to 4% lymphocytes, 6% macrophages and no eosinophils, which suggested infectious lung disease or acute diffuse lung injury [20] . However, no microorganisms (e.g., (myco)bacteria, moulds, fungi, or viruses (entero-, rhino-, parainfluenza, adeno-, herpes simplex, or cytomegalovirus)) were detected. PCR on the BAL fluid for herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Bordetella pertussis also proved negative. Additional histopathological examination of the lavage liquid did not reveal malignant cells. There was no family history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), and there were no coexisting medical conditions that favoured the development of ILD. Moreover, there had been no occupational exposure to pulmonary toxins and no prior use of potential ILD-causing drugs (e.g., bleomycin, busulphan, gemcitabine, mitomycin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, nitrofurantoin, amiodarone), with the exception of the FOLFOX chemotherapy.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2554, "end": 2558, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 455, "end": 464, "text": "(Fig. 1a)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 481, "end": 490, "text": "(Fig. 1b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 550, "end": 559, "text": "(Fig. 1b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1322, "end": 1328, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Case presentation"}, {"text": "Given the proof of the absence of pulmonary infection, at 48 h after admission, high-dose corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 4 \u00d7 250 mg per day) were administered intravenously (IV) over 5 consecutive days followed by a tapering scheme.

No infectious causes triggering the clinical picture were identified, although the high neutrophil count in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was initially strongly suggestive of microbial disease. In retrospect, we found that this finding was also compatible with drug-induced lung disease [20] . In view of the fact that an autoimmune disease could not be diagnosed, the administration of FOLFOX was considered to be the probable and most plausible cause of the biopsy-proven interstitial pneumonitis.

Thus far, there have been no reports linking folinic acid (leucovorin) in monotherapy to pulmonary toxicity. Five-fluorouracil is a thymidilate synthase inhibitor whose antimetabolite properties are enhanced by folates. It is one of the most frequently used chemotherapeutic agents and is applied in mono-and combined therapy for various solid malignancies of the head, neck, breast, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, prostate and bladder. Known side effects include alopecia, stomatitis, emesis, coronary spasms, hand-foot syndrome, diarrhoea and myelosuppression [48, 49] . There has only been one (Japanese) report of pulmonary toxicity accompanying the administration of 5-FU as monotherapy [50] . Oxaliplatin is a third-generation platinum derivative (diaminocyclohexane, containing platinum) that blocks DNA replication and transcription through the induction of intrastrand or interstrand lesions and DNA protein cross links [51] . Oxaliplatin is active against breast, gastric and colon cancers, renal cell carcinoma, sarcoma and cisplatin-resistant cell lines and tumour models including lung, ovarian, cervix, colon and leukaemia cell lines [51] . Known side effects include alopecia, peripheral sensory neuropathy (limb dysesthesia or paresthesia), haematological abnormalities (anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia), electrolyte disturbances (hyponatraemia, kalaemia), hepatocellular injury, nausea and vomiting, ototoxicity and laryngeal dysesthesia [6, 52, 53] . An important indirect argument pointing in the direction of oxaliplatin as \"the\" pulmonary toxicity-inducing culprit lies in the observation that respiratory symptoms present during FOLFOX therapy do not recur after rechallenge with a 5-FU-and leucovorin-containing but oxaliplatin-deprived chemotherapy cocktail [4, 7, 12, 14, [16] [17] [18] [19] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 662, "end": 666, "text": "[48,", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 667, "end": 670, "text": "49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 792, "end": 796, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1029, "end": 1033, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1248, "end": 1252, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1562, "end": 1565, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1566, "end": 1569, "text": "52,", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1570, "end": 1573, "text": "53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1889, "end": 1892, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1893, "end": 1895, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1896, "end": 1899, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1900, "end": 1903, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1904, "end": 1908, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1909, "end": 1913, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1914, "end": 1918, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1919, "end": 1923, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "When ILD is thought to be secondary to a chemical insult, discontinuation of the causative agent should be the first therapeutic intervention.

Given that arguments linking oxaliplatin administration to glutathione depletion exist [30, 32] , it seemed logical to continue glutathione supplementation because this molecule plays an important role in protecting the lungs against oxidative damage, which is a possible and probable contributing factor to the emergence of interstitial pneumonitis and subsequent evolution to pulmonary fibrosis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 530, "end": 534, "text": "[30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 535, "end": 538, "text": "32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Accounting for the severity of the illness, corticosteroid therapy, which is a well-established therapy modality, was initiated shortly after disease onset.

These IVIgs were administered over a five-day period. The rationale for this treatment was found in experimental data that indicated that IVIgs are capable of preventing and treating bleomycininduced pulmonary fibrosis in mice through the reduced expression of collagen-I protein in the affected lungs [23, 24] . Postulated mechanisms of this anti-fibrotic action of IVIg include modulation of cytokine production, inhibition of the complement reaction and inhibition of the CD95 receptor (Fas) activity through the presence of anti-Fas antibodies in IVIg [23, 54, 55] . Subsequently, one dose of cyclophosphamide, a nitrogen mustard alkylating and lymphocyte-modulating agent, was administered. This immunosuppressive steroid-sparing agent is used to treat autoimmune inflammatory disorders and associated interstitial lung disease and is frequently added to corticosteroid therapy to enhance the clinical response due to the additional suppression of immunoreactions that cause lung damage [56] .
