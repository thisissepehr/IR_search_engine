Anaesthetic gases such as iso\u00afurane, halothane and en\u00afurane are known to reduce ciliary beat frequency, but it is unknown whether they also cause cilia to beat in a dyskinetic fashion. Brush biopsies of nasal mucosa were taken pre-and post-anaesthesia with iso\u00afurane, given via a laryngeal mask, from patients undergoing nasal surgery. The samples were observed by light microscopy, and high-speed digital video recordings were made to determine ciliary beat frequency. Using slow-motion playback, the ciliary beat pattern was scored for dysmotility, and the proportion of immotile cilia in the sample was determined. We found that ciliary beat frequency decreased signi\u00aecantly (P < 0.01) after exposure to iso\u00afurane (10.24 Hz compared to 9.20 Hz). However, iso\u00afurane did not alter the ciliary beat pattern or the proportion of immotile cilia.",

            "text": "Effective mucociliary clearance plays a major role in the host defence of the respiratory tract, reducing the build-up of mucus and the risk of secondary bacterial infection. It is particularly important in the postoperative period where patients may have a depressed respiratory drive, and abdominal wounds may inhibit clearance of secretions by coughing. Inhibition of effective mucociliary clearance can lead to postoperative complications such as basal atelectasis, respiratory infections 1,2 and sinusitis. 3 Certain anaesthetic agents have been shown to decrease mucociliary clearance, 4,5 most probably by affecting ciliary function. In vitro studies, using perfusion chambers, have shown that direct exposure to the inhalational anaesthetics halothane, en\u00afurane and iso\u00afurane decreases ciliary beat frequency. 6\u00b18 A recent study of patients undergoing elective surgery found that facemask anaesthesia, maintained with iso\u00afurane, also caused a signi\u00aecant decrease in nasal ciliary beat frequency. 9 Other agents used in anaesthesia such as morphine, midazolam and propofol have been found not to affect ciliary beat frequency. 9\u00b111 Ex vivo measurement of ciliary beat frequency has been widely used to assess the toxicity and effect of various substances and drugs including anaesthetic agents. It has been assumed that if there is no change in beat frequency, the ability of the cilia to propel mucus is not affected. This can no longer be assumed as a dyskinetic beat pattern may be seen in patients with a normal ciliary beat frequency. Using a highspeed video system, we have recently shown that nasal cilia, examined 3 days after infection of healthy volunteers with coronavirus, had a normal beat frequency but beat in a dyskinetic fashion. 12 In addition, we found that patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia, caused by a transposition defect of the cilia ultrastructure, had a normal ciliary beat frequency but with a circular beat pattern that is ineffective in propelling mucus. 13 It is unknown whether anaesthetic agents cause ciliary dyskinesia as well as a reduction in ciliary beat frequency. This is important to study, as a combination of reduced ciliary beat frequency and ciliary dyskinesia may have a signi\u00aecant effect on mucociliary clearance.",

Maintenance of anaesthesia was with isourane gas (1\u00b14% depending upon the individual patient's response) with air-oxygen delivered via a laryngeal mask. Intra-operative analgesia was also given in the form of intravenous opiode (morphine) and/or intravenous non-steroidal anti-in\u00afammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (ketolorac). No preoperative sedation was given. Brush biopsies were taken using bronchoscopy biopsy brushes (Diagmed Ltd., UK). Pre-anaesthesia brushings were taken from the nasal cavity, whilst the patient was still in the anaesthetic room, after anaesthetic induction with propofol but before the use of volatile gases (iso\u00afurane). After approximately 30 min of general anaesthesia time, the inferior turbinates were excised and collected for examination. Post-anaesthesia samples were obtained by brushing the turbinates immediately after excision. The samples were transported and stored in media 199 (ICN Biochemicals, USA), chilled on ice and taken immediately to the laboratory for examination. c i l i a ry b e at f r e q u e n c y, c i l i a ry b e at pat t e r n a n d i m m o t i l i t y i n d e x Ciliated strips of epithelium were suspended in a chamber created by the separation of a cover slip and a glass slide by two adjacent cover slips. The slide was placed on a heated stage (37 8C) of a Leitz, Diaplan microscope mounted on an antivibration table (Wentworth Laboratories Ltd.). Specimens were examined using a \u00c2100 interference contrast lens. Only undisrupted strips greater than 50 mm in length were studied. Beating edges were recorded using a digital high-speed camera (Kodak Motioncorder 1000) at a rate of 400 frames per second, using a shutter speed of 1 in 4000. The camera allowed video sequences to be played at reduced frame rates or frame by frame. This allowed the precise movement of individual cilia to be observed during their beat cycle.",

This reduction is similar to the decreases in ciliary beat frequency found in previous in vitro studies on nasal epithelium. 6\u00b18 Small reductions in ciliary beat frequency have signi\u00aecant effects on mucociliary clearance because the relationship between ciliary beat frequency and mucus transport rate is thought to be logarithmic. 14 The 10% reduction in nasal ciliary beat frequency found in this study would therefore signi\u00aecantly affect the nasal mucociliary clearance and consequently decrease the protective function of nasal mucociliary transport.",

Anaesthetic agents are known to diffuse out of tissue into the culture medium, and the higher the surface area to mass ratio, the quicker the diffusion of volatile agents. To avoid the loss of iso\u00afurane by diffusion, we took excised turbinates immediately to the laboratory where they were brushed and the ciliated epithelium was examined. It has been shown that it takes 60 min for the iso\u00afurane to wash out of turbinates, 7 and our samples were all examined as soon as possible after collection, and in all cases within 30 min.",

It is possible that anaesthetic agents, such as iso\u00afurane, may play a part in nasal symptoms following general anaesthesia by depressing ciliary function. Whether direct exposure of the nasal epithelium or lower respiratory tract to higher concentrations of iso\u00afurane would result in a greater degree of ciliary slowing, or whether this would then have an effect on ciliary beat pattern, requires further investigation.",
