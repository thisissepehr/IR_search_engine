However, the mean-field approach cannot show the detailed contagion process, which is important in the control of epidemic. To fill this gap, we present a novel approach to study how the topological structure of complex network influences the concrete process of epidemic spreading. After transforming the network structure into hierarchical layers, we introduce a set of new parameters, i.e., the average fractions of degree for outgoing, ingoing, and remaining in the same layer, to describe the infection process. We find that this set of parameters are closely related to the degree distribution and the clustering coefficient but are more convenient than them in describing the process of epidemic spreading. Moreover, we find that the networks with exponential distribution have slower spreading speed than the networks with power-law degree distribution. Numerical simulations have confirmed the theoretical predictions.",

It is found that the features of small world and scale-free networks can influence seriously the epidemic spreading on complex networks [3\u221220] . There are two typical models that describe epidemic spreading process by the contacts between infected and healthy individuals in traditional significance. They are the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model and the susceptible-infected-refractory (SIR) model. The SIS model is a two state model in which the individuals (nodes) can only exist in one of the states: susceptible or infected [3] [4] [5] . The SIS model has been studied in both small world [9] and scale-free networks [3] . The results show that, in the case of scale-free network, the infection can spread to the entire network even when the probability of the transmission is infinitely small. This result is in sharp contrast to the well-known threshold phenomenon in epidemiology [21] . While the SIR model is a three state model in which the individuals (nodes) can exist in one of the three states: susceptible, infected or refractory [6-8, 10, 11] where the refractory describes the immune state or the death of infected individuals. Compared with the SIS model, the SIR model incorporates the factor that the infected nodes may be selfrecovery or become refractory. Once a node is in the status of refractory, it can be considered as being removed. In this paper, we choose the SIR model to study the spreading process of epidemic.",

For an infected node, which of its neighboring nodes will be infected at the next step is uncertain. However, epidemic spreading can not be simply treated as the random walk on complex network which is now attracting some attention [22] [23] [24] [25] . An obvious difference between the random walk and the epidemic spreading is that for the former the number of moving agents is a constant and the individuals cannot duplicate themselves; while for the latter the infected number changes with time and it is possible for an infected node to make several neighboring nodes be infected at the next time step. Another difference is that the random walk can go back and forth, while the epidemic in SIR model can only go along the direction to the refractory. It is found that for a well mixed SIR model, the evolutions of S, I, and R nodes satisfy a set of meanfield equations [7, 8, 10, 21] . By these equations we can get a solution on how many nodes can be finally infected and how the network topology influences the final infected number. However, the mean-field approach can only show the infected number but cannot tell the detailed information of infection, such as how fast the epidemic is spread, how large fraction of the infected nodes is in the front of spreading, and which nodes will be infected in the next step etc. The purpose of this paper is to answer these questions.",

            "text": "The complex networks can be characterized by several structure parameters, such as the degree distribution P (k), the clustering coefficient C, and the average degree k etc., which reflect the aspects of statistical average of network structure. The dynamics in complex networks, such as the synchronization, information propagation, and epidemic spreading etc., can be seriously influenced by the topological structure of networks or by the structure parameters [1, 2] . However, these structure parameters are not always convenient in describing the dynamical processes in networks. For example, in the case of epidemic spreading, these parameters can show how the network structure influences the total infected nodes but cannot answer the questions given in the last paragraph. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce some new characteristic parameters to describe the detailed spreading process. For implementing this purpose, in this paper we transform the topological structure of complex network into hierarchical layers and introduce a set of new parameters, i.e., the average fractions of degree for outgoing f +1 , ingoing f \u22121 , and remaining in the same layer f 0 , to describe the infection process. Different from the mean-field method, this approach is of favor in characterizing the detailed process of infection. By this approach we find that f +1 is the key factor to determine the spreading speed and the front infected nodes while f \u22121 and f 0 determine the localized spreading in the complex networks. By checking two typical networks with exponential and power-law degree distribution, respectively, we find that the former has slower spreading speed than the latter. A heuristic argument is given to explain our findings.",

We let the seed infect each of its neighbors with a probability \u03bb. And then the infected nodes will continue to infect their neighbors.

Without loss of generality, we set \u03bc = 1 since it only affects the definition of the time scale of the virus propagation [21] , i.e., the infected status can be kept only for one time step. We use I(t) to denote the number of infected nodes at time t. With time going, the infected nodes will have larger and larger distances to the original seed and I(t) will increase. At a finite time, I(t) will begin to decrease until there is no longer any infected nodes in the network, then the process is over. The larger the probability \u03bb is, the larger the number of final infected nodes. When \u03bb = 1, the number reaches its maximum N and all the nodes of the network have been infected. Take an infection process as an example. There are I(t) infected nodes at time t. These nodes have different distances to the original seed. Suppose d denotes the shortest distance between the infected node i and the original seed. d can be calculated as follows: d equals 1 if the infected node i is one of the neighbors of the original seed and 2 if it is the neighbor's neighbor of the original seed, and so on. Generally, d will have a distribution of different values at time t for all the infected nodes except two situations. The first one is, for the case of \u03bb = 1, the infection will be transmitted to all the nodes with the same distance, resulting d = t for all the I(t). The second one is for the tree-like network where the epidemic propagation will keep outgoing and all the distances d equal the time t. However, most of the realistic networks are not strictly tree-like but small world and scale-free [1, 2] . There are local loops in the topological structure, such as the triangles. The existence of loops will definitely influence the value of d. For example, the infection may be propagated to a node of a triangle and then it is possible to be propagated to the direction of backing to the original seed, resulting that some d decrease with time. Therefore, we here concern what is the distribution of d on different distances and how the distribution depends on the network structure. These questions cannot be answered by the mean-field method as the method does not distinguish the distances. To answer these questions, we transform the network into hierarchical layers with the same center and different radii where the center is the original seed and the distance between the neighboring layers is unity. The nodes on the first layer are the neighboring nodes of the original seed and have d = 1, and the nodes on the second layer are the neighbor's neighbors of the original seed and have d = 2, and so on. The existence of loops/triangles means that the infection can be transmitted from one node to another one on the same layer. Once it happens, this step does not make d increase 1. Further, the infection may go back to the nearest inner layer if the inner connected node is susceptible, see the schematic Fig. 1 . An important problem in the control of epidemic is how fast the epidemic spread, i.e., the speed of spread. For the convenience of study, we consider here the distance as the topological distance but not the physical distance. Suppose the number of infected nodes with distance t is I 1 (t) and the total infected nodes is I(t). Letting \u03c1 1 (t) = I 1 (t)/I(t), I 1 (t) and I(t) reflect the speed of spreading and \u03c1 1 (t) represents the fraction of front infected nodes in I(t). Let's figure out how I 1 (t) and \u03c1 1 (t) depend on the structure of network.",

The former represents how many nodes have the same links and the latter characterizes the propensity for two of one's neighbors to be neighbors also of each other [26] . The larger C means the larger density of triangles. These quantities are very useful in describing the dynamics on networks, such as the synchronization and information propagation etc. [27] [28] [29] [30] , but they are not the good candidates for describing the I 1 (t) and \u03c1 1 (t). Hence, we introduce some new parameters to obtain I 1 (t) and \u03c1 1 (t), which is related to P (k) and C. Considering the fact that I 1 (t) and \u03c1 1 (t) are closely related to the outgoing links of a node, we use f +1 i to denote the average fraction of outgoing part of a node on the layer i in Fig. 1 for a large number of realizations. Similarly, we use f \u22121 i and f 0 i to denote the average fractions of degree of ingoing and remaining in the same layer, respectively. As most of the realistic networks has the small world feature, the average distance between any two nodes, D, is not very large. For example, D \u2248 ln N/ ln ln N for the scale-free network [1, 2] . It is very easy for the infection to reach the boundary of network. After that, the distance d can not be increased further. Therefore, the meaningful time for I 1 (t) and \u03c1 1 (t) is around D. We here limit the effective infection process to t \u223c 2D. Noticing that the average number of nodes n i on the layer i is different for different layers, the average degree on each layer should also be different. We use k i to denote the average degree on the layer i. By these quantities, we figure out the average nodes on each layer is n 1 = k for the layer 1,",

Fig. 3 shows the results for different rewiring probabilities where (a) represents the relation for k d versus d, Fig. 3(a) it is easy to see that the average degrees on different layers k d are approximate constants when d D and then keep constant for the case of p = 0.1 but decrease for the cases of p = 0.4 and 1 when d > D. The reason is that for the case of p = 0.1, only 10% of links are rewired and 90% of links keeps the constant degree k , resulting the approximate constant k d for different d. While in the case of p = 1, the network becomes a random network with an exponential degree distribution and diameter D = ln N/ ln k \u2248 5 for N = 10 4 and K = 6 [1, 2] . That is, most of them have the degree around k . When d D, there are a lot of nodes on each layer and their degree average should be around k . When d > D, the nodes on each layer decreases very fast because of the boundary. Usually, these nodes are of smaller degree as the nodes with larger degree have a larger probability to connect to the seed or seed's neighbors and thus they do not stay at the layers with d > D. Therefore, the nodes on the layers with d > D have smaller k d . After understanding these two limit cases, the case of p = 0.4 is just in between the cases of p = 0.1 and 1. Similarly, we can explain the behaviors of f +1 d in Fig. 3(b) . From the boundary effect it is also easy to understand the peak in Fig. 3 (c) and the higher tail in Fig. 3(d) . When d is slightly over D, the f +1 notes the average outgoing degree on the layer d and the lines with the \"circles\", \"stars\", \"triangles\", and \"squares\" represent the cases of d = 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. It is easy to see that k d increases only about 8%, but k out d increases to 2 to 3 times when p changes from 0 to 1. The underlying reason comes from the big change in degree distribution P (k). As we know, P (k) has only one value for the regular ring lattice of p = 0. In this case, there are equal possibility for outgoing, ingoing, and remaining in the same layer, hence k out d = k /3. While for the case of p = 1, the random network has a very small clustering coefficient, hence it is a tree-like structure in the hierarchical layers, resulting k out d \u2248 k d \u22121. Therefore, the big change of P (k) results a big change of k out d when p changes from 0 to 1. Later, we will see that this phenomenon has a big influence to \u03c1 1 (t).",

We find that both the infected nodes I(t) and the infected front nodes I 1 (t) are depending on the parameters p and \u03bb. Fig. 5 shows the results for different p where the lines with the \"circles\", \"stars\", \"triangles\", \"squares\", \"asterisks\", and \"pluses\" represent the cases of p = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 1, respectively; (a) and (b) denote the case of \u03bb = 0.2, and (c) and (d) the case of \u03bb = 0.4. Obviously, both the I(t) and I 1 (t) are small numbers in the case of \u03bb = 0.2 and large numbers in the case of \u03bb = 0.4, which can be understood from the nonlinear relationship between I 1 (t) and \u03bb in Eq. (1). To understand how the structure parameters f +1 i , f \u22121 i , f 0 i , and k i influence the I(t) and I 1 (t), let's focus on the case of \u03bb = 0.2. Fig. 5(b) shows that the total infected nodes I(t) decrease with t for small p but increase with t for large p and Fig. 5(a) shows that I 1 (t) is a concave curve for small p but a convex curve for large p, implying that the random network is in favor of epidemic spreading than the small world network. This phenomenon can be understood by checking Fig. 3(b) or Fig. 4(b) . Fig. 4(b) shows that k out d has a small value for small p but a large value for large p, i.e., small f +1 d for small p and large f +1 d for large p in Fig. 3(b) . Therefore, the epidemic will spread out with a larger probability f +1 d in the case with larger p and results a larger fraction of I 1 (t) in I(t). Instituting f +1 d into n d and then both into Eq. (1) we can understand the behavior of I 1 (t). To see the fraction of I 1 (t) in I(t) conveniently, we study the \u03c1 1 (t) versus t. We find that the variation of \u03bb has larger influence for \u03c1 1 (t) for the cases of small p but small influence to the cases of larger p. Fig. 6 shows how \u03c1 1 (t) changes with \u03bb for different p. Obviously, \u03c1 1 (t) curve has larger variation in Fig. 6(a) and (b) and small variation in (c) and (d). The reason is that for the radial spreading of large p, the larger \u03bb will mainly increase I 1 (t) and results in a small deviation in \u03c1 1 (t); while for the local spreading with small p, the local part will lack of enough susceptible nodes to be infected and hence increase the fraction of I 1 (t) in I(t), resulting in a large deviation in \u03c1 1 (t).",

Comparing Fig. 7 with Fig. 3 , one can see that their common behaviors are that both the peaks in their panel (c) and both the increasing points in their panel (d) appear at about d \u2248 D. The reason is that both the WS and the HK models have the boundary restriction, whose consequence has been explained in the case of WS model. Their difference is that both k d and f +1 d for d D are approximate constants in the Fig. 3(a) and (b) but not in Fig. 7(a) and (b). This difference comes from their different degree distributions. Comparing with the WS model with short-range degree distribution, the HK model has a widely distributed P (k) with power law. The hub nodes in power law distribution have much larger possibility to be connected by the seed than other nodes, i.e., the center in Fig. 1 will prefer to connect to the hub nodes. Therefore, the nodes with the largest links will most probably stay in the layer 1 and then for the same reason, the nodes with degree close to the hubs will most probably stay in the layer 2 and so on, indicating a decrease of k d with d. In detail, we may figure out the value of k d for a large number of realizations. Obviously, the average degree on the center is k 0 = k . Suppose the center has degree k for a specific realization, it will connect a node of degree k on the layer 1 by the conditional probability P (k |k). The average degree of the connected node is k P (k |k), and the total degrees of all the k nodes on the layer 1 is k k P (k |k). As the possibility for the center to take degree k is P (k), the total degrees of all the nodes on the layer 1 is P (k)k k P (k |k). Hence, the average degree on the layer 1 is",

Comparing Fig. 4(c) and (d) with Fig. 4(a) and (b) , respectively, one can see that both k d and k out d have significant change in the case of WS model but have only slight changes in the case of HK model. The reason is that P (k) has a big change in the WS model when p changes from 0 to 1 while P (k) does not change in the HK model when p t changes from 0 to 1. Hence, k 2 has a big change for different p in the WS model but no change for different p t in the HK model. By Eq.

Another point we notice here is that the peaks in 8(b) and (d) are much early than that in Fig. 5(b) and (d), indicating the evolution time of infection in HK model is shorter than that in WS model. This phenomenon is consistent with the value of I(t) where the larger I(t) makes the evolution process finish quick and hence half of the evolution time, i.e., the time for the peaks of I(t), will come early. Figure 9 shows how \u03c1 1 changes with t in HK model for different \u03bb and p t . Comparing Fig. 9 with Fig. 6 we see that \u03c1 1 are widely spread for different p in the WS model but relatively concentrated for different p t in the HK model. This can be understood quantitative from the different structure parameters f +1 i , f \u22121 i , f 0 i , and k i . Namely, we may have the answer by instituting the corresponding parameters into Eq. (1). In qualitative, we may also explain it by the degree distribution P (k) and the clustering coefficient C. As both P (k) and C change with p in the WS model, thus \u03c1 1 are widely spread; while in HK model only C changes with p t but P (k) does not, thus \u03c1 1 are relatively concentrated. Moreover, the larger p t corresponds to the larger C and hence reduce \u03c1 1 more.",

We find that the theoretic I 1 (t) is in consistent with the results of numerical simulations. Fig. 10 shows the results where the dotted lines denote the theoretic results from Eq. (1): the solid lines denote the numerical simulations, (a) for the WS model; (b) for the HK model; in (a) the lines with \"circles\" are for p = 0.1 and the lines with \"triangles\" are for p = 0.4; in (b) the lines with \"circles\" are for p t = 0 and the lines with \"triangles\" are for p t = 0.8. From Fig. 10(a) , we see that the theoretic result is almost overlapped with the numerical simulation in the case of approximate random network with p = 0.4 but they have a finite difference in the case of small world network with p = 0.1. From Fig. 10(b) we see that there is a finite difference between the theoretic and numerical results for both the BA model with p t = 0 and the highly clustered network with p t = 0.8. The reason is that Eq. (1) is derived based on a mean-field assumption. As both the small world network and the HK model are somehow away from the heterogeneous network, thus theoretic results have a finite difference from the numerical simulation. In sum, Eq. (1) grasps qualitatively the features of epidemic spreading in general.",

However, the speed of epidemic spread is very important. Its understanding may shed light on the control of epidemic spread, such as the SARS etc. As we know, the social network has high clustering coefficient [37] . How to give different efficient strategies to control the epidemic spreading in communities with different structures is significant. This work may stimulate some further research in this direction.",

This phenomenon is consistent with the value of I(t) where the larger I(t) makes the evolution process finish quick and hence half of the evolution time, i.e., the time for the peaks of I(t), will come early. Figure 9 shows how \u03c1 1 changes with t in HK model for different \u03bb and p t . Comparing Fig. 9 with Fig. 6 we see that \u03c1 1 are widely spread for different p in the WS model but relatively concentrated for different p t in the HK model. This can be understood quantitative from the different structure parameters f +1 i , f \u22121 i , f 0 i , and k i . Namely, we may have the answer by instituting the corresponding parameters into Eq. (1). In qualitative, we may also explain it by the degree distribution P (k) and the clustering coefficient C. As both P (k) and C change with p in the WS model, thus \u03c1 1 are widely spread; while in HK model only C changes with p t but P (k) does not, thus \u03c1 1 are relatively concentrated. Moreover, the larger p t corresponds to the larger C and hence reduce \u03c1 1 more. To confirm the theoretic formula (1), we substitute the obtained values of k d , f +1 1 , and f \u22121 1 into Eq. (1) to calculate the predicted I 1 (t). We find that the theoretic I 1 (t) is in consistent with the results of numerical simulations. Fig. 10 shows the results where the dotted lines denote the theoretic results from Eq. (1): the solid lines denote the numerical simulations, (a) for the WS model; (b) for the HK model; in (a) the lines with \"circles\" are for p = 0.1 and the lines with \"triangles\" are for p = 0.4; in (b) the lines with \"circles\" are for p t = 0 and the lines with \"triangles\" are for p t = 0.8.
