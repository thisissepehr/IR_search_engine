While it probably merely represents attenuation of the original virus, this result has uncovered a unique virus-host interaction for a picornavirus: a slow infection. It is indeed remarkable that the incubation period, which ranged from one to five months, represents an appreciable portion of the life span of the mouse.

In contrast to other viruses, there is little experimental evidence to suggest that picornaviruses can remain latent, either integrated into the cell genome or existing in the cytoplasm in the form of defective particles. From investigations of carrier culture systems it is known that picornaviruses establish steady-state infections with virus replicating in only a fraction of the cell population at any one time [21] . In this situation it is believed that when a cell becomes infected, virus is probably allowed to complete its normal replicative cycle, and the cell is destroyed. This notion is strongly supported by the fact that picornaviruses are highly cytolytic agents, probably due to their ability to rapidly suppress host cell protein synthesis [ 151 so that it is unlikely a cell can survive once it is infected. Further, overwhelming infection is probably pre-vented by innate resistance of the majority of the cell population at risk or by the host's immune response.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 664, "end": 668, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 135, "end": 142, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Obviously, the precise mechanisms of picornavirus persistence remain to be elucidated.
