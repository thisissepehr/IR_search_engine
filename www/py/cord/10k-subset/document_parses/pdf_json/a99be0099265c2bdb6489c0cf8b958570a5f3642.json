            "text": "Avian influenza (AI) is an infectious disease caused by avian influenza viruses (AIVs) which belong to the influenza virus A group. AI causes tremendous economic losses in poultry industry and pose great threatens to human health. Active serologic surveillance is necessary to prevent and control the spread of AI. In this study, a protein microarray using nucleoprotein (NP) of H5N1 AIV expressed in insect cells was developed to detect antibodies against AIV NP protein. The protein microarray was used to test Newcastle disease virus (NDV), infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), AIV positive and negative sera. The results indicated that the protein microarray could hybridize specifically with antibodies against AIV with strong signals and without cross-hybridization. Moreover, 76 field serum samples were detected by microarray, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and hemagglutination inhibition test (HI). The positive rate was 92.1% (70/76), 93.4% (71/76) and 89.4% (68/76) by protein microarray, ELISA and HI test, respectively. Compared with ELISA, the microarray showed 100% (20/20) agreement ratio in chicken and 98.2% (55/56) in ornamental bird. In conclusion, this method provides an alternative serological diagnosis for influenza antibody screening and will provide a basis for the development of protein microarrays that can be used to respectively detect antibodies of different AIV subtypes and other pathogens.

According to antigenic differences in their nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix protein (M1), influenza viruses are classified into three genera or types: A, B and C. All avian influenza viruses (AIVs) belong to type A, and the large group is further characterized into differential subtypes based on specific hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Currently, 16 hemagglutinin (H1 to H16) and 9 neuraminidase (N1 to N9) subtypes have been isolated in AIV [10, 28] . Wild waterfowl and shorebirds are recognized as the natural reservoir of influenza virus, and all subtypes of influenza virus could be identified from birds [23, 27] . AIV poses a significant threat to the poultry industry worldwide. Moreover, AIV has the potential to cross species barriers to trigger human pandemics [8, 11] , such as human infections with H7N9 that occurred in Shanghai, Zhejiang and other provinces in China in 2013. Therefore, active serologic surveillance is necessary to prevent and control the spread of AIV.",

The HI and NI assays are relatively inexpensive and utilized as standard procedure in most labs. However, the HI and NI assays are laborious and rely on having well matched control reference reagents. The AGP test is timeconsuming and requires large quantities of both antigens and antibodies to form the precipitation lines. Consequently, various enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for the detection of antibodies to influenza virus, which is more sensitivity relative to the HI, NI and AGP test [24, 30] . As a result of technology development, microarray technology was applied in disease diagnosis, which allows the simultaneous analysis of thousands of parameters within a single experiment. Currently, protein microarray has shown great potential for disease diagnosis [13, 14] and serology detection [2, 21, 26] . Traditional protein microarray requires expensive equipments, considerable skills and high costs. Thus, this method is rarely applied in veterinary clinics and still in the initial stages of research. In previous report, our laboratory developed a protein chip combining with colloidal gold immunological amplification and a silver staining method to detect antibodies against four avian viruses [26] . This method can scan visually color change without expensive equipments.",

Compared with HI test, there are some advantages to using protein microarrays. One advantage of the protein microarray is the application in DIVA (differentiating infected from vaccinated animals) strategies when recombinant vaccines without the NP protein are used in poultry. Moreover, the use of small volumes of reagents and antibodies is also a characteristic of protein microarrays, which made it economical and useful for those conditions when large quantities of samples were not easy to get. It is well known that wild waterfowl and shorebirds play an important role in disseminating AIV among different regions [15, 18] . However, it was hard to obtain large volumes of sera from these birds. Thus, there are practical limitations to the application of traditional serological tests. Optimistically, protein microarray can provide qualitative information regarding antibodies in wild waterfowl and shorebirds, which is valuable and useful for the surveillance of field situations and for controlling the prevalence of influenza viruses, but the HI assay is still necessary for subsequent subtyping.",

            "text": "ELISA is another option for AIV surveillance and/or evaluation of vaccine efficacy. The results indicate that similar detection rate is obtained from ELISA and protein microar- ray analysis (92.1% and 93.4%), but the direction of microarray and ELISA is not the same. Differential antibodies are detected in a separate assay with ELISA array. While parallel antibodies can be detected on one chip without non-specific reactions, thus protein microarray may be more convenient than ELISA. In this study, only one antigen was employed to develop a protein microarray for AIV antibodies detection, which does not achieve high-throughput capability. However, this study verifies the feasibility of the method, and this method has great potential in serological investigations and eradication of AIV from certain flocks. In future studies, we can increase the number of antigens in this microarray to achieve high-throughput capability and attempt to simultaneously detect antibodies of different diseases, which may broaden the range of detection for microarrays and provide a basis for animal disease diagnosis and other studies.
