Phylogenetic evidence suggests that these viruses have originated from avian influenza A viruses, either unchanged or after reassortment with human influenza A viruses. In aquatic birds, all of the known H and N antigenic varieties (15 varieties carry H, nine carry N envelope glycoproteins) apparently circulate in a genetically conserved fashion. Viruses carrying the H1N1, H2N2 and H3N2 combinations were responsible for the Spanish flu of 1918, the Asian flu in 1957 and Hong Kong flu in 1968, respectively 1 . An influenza A virus of the H5N1 subtype has now been identified in a human patient, raising discussions about its potential to spark a new human influenza pandemic.",

We retrieved the first type from the core of a cathode deposit produced by a carbon arc. We produced the openended type from the first using a purification process, by which graphite grains and nanoparticles were removed by oxidation with the aid of CuCl 2 intercalation 5 . We To make an electron emitter from capped MWNTs, we picked up a needle-like fragment (~0.1 mm diameter, 1-2 mm long) from the cathode deposit, and fixed it to a hairpin-shaped tungsten or nichrome wire (diameter 0.3 mm) using carbon paste. For the purified MWNTs, we cut out a thin thread (less than 0.1 mm wide, 1-2 mm long) with a sharp tip from the mat of MWNTs, using a razor, and attached a wire as before. We positioned the MWNT 60 mm in front of a microchannel plate, which had an effective diameter of 42 mm, and placed a fluorescent screen just behind the plate. The working pressure of the vacuum chamber for FEM was typically 2 \u01c210 \u01c19 torr, and the emitter tip was cooled to near liquid-nitrogen temperature. Emission patterns were recorded with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (Hamamatsu C5985).",

A black spot in the central region -the absence of electrons in the core of a beam -corresponds to an exposed cavity. Diameters of inner black spots measured on the screen (2-3.5 mm) and the inner diameters of MWNTs (typically 5-10 nm) indicate an approximate magnification of one million for our FEM. As the electrons emitted from the tip are radially accelerated toward the screen, the beam from an open tube forms a hollow cone. The apex angles of the outer and inner cones of the hollow beam are about 0.2 and 0.05 radians, respectively. Using open-ended nanotubes we can produce a unique tubular configuration of the electron beam.",

First, more than 1 ng DNA (equivalent to 200 cells) is required; and second, a single STR locus is used, which does not provide much information.
