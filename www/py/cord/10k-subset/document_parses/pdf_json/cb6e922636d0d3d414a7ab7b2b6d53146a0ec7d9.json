Moreover, mortality rates remain high in patients with active severe pulmonary TB requiring mechanical ventilation [3] . Delays in diagnosis and treatment have been recognized as causes of death due to pulmonary TB, and several studies have sought to reduce these delays by identifying factors that should lead to a high index of suspicion [4, 5, 6, 7] . Reasons for missing the diagnosis of TB have included failure to perform appropriate diagnostic investigations and misinterpretation of the radiologic or clinical manifestations of TB as indicating a malignancy, pneumonia or other conditions [8, 9, 10] .",

As reported by others [1, 35] and despite established guidelines, both the physicians who provided care prior to ICU admission (77 (77.7 %) of the 99 patients) and the ICU physicians (8 (26.6 %) of the 30 patients not on anti-TB therapy at ICU admission failed to consider TB. Treatment delays may be dependent on the experience and practice patterns of individual clinicians, which are probably modifiable with education [7] .",

Nevertheless, these parameters are included in, or related to, SAPS II score, lymphopenia or ARDS. Moreover, associated infections did not correlate independently with mortality, serum albumin at admission, number of lobes with chest radiograph involvement or number of organ failures. The number of organ failures was strongly and independently associated with 30-day mortality in our patients with pulmonary TB, whereas the SAPS II score at admission was not. An association between the APACHE II score and mortality in patients with TB requiring mechanical ventilation has been reported [1] . However, one study suggested that the APACHE II score consistently underestimated mortality, particularly in patients without comorbidities and despite obvious and significant destructive lung changes [37] .",

We believe that our study provides clinicians with epidemiological information capable of helping them maintain a high index of suspicion when appropriate. Despite the potential toxicity of empirical TB treatment and because delayed treatment can result in death of the patient and of other individuals contaminated by nosocomial spread [38, 39] , we recommend that ICU patients with weight loss, cough, sweating and fever without evidence of documented infection be promptly given an effective combination of anti-TB medications before the results of diagnostic tests are available. In immunocompromised patients, even those without characteristic pulmonary infiltrates, TB should be considered routinely and the index of suspicion should be particularly high if the symptoms started several days before admission, even if these symptoms could be ascribed to the underlying condition. Our results also suggest that primary care physicians and intensivists should be encouraged to use screening measures more widely.",
