Numbers of animals available are usually small, and so it is difficult to obtain statistically significant results. In several reported tests, the death rate from multiple anaesthetic procedures has been quite high. Human volunteers are therefore altogether preferable. This means that any potential drug with high in-vitro activity against rhinovirus has to be submitted to complete toxicity and safety evaluation before it is known to have any in-vivo activity at all.

They are also unusual in that they inactivate virus particles on contact and this inhibition is reversed by extraction with non-polar solvents. These facts indicate that the compounds act by attaching to that part of the virus particle required to initiate penetration into a susceptible cell, and blocking the process.
