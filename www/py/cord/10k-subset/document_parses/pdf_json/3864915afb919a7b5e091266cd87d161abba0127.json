Design: Prospective cohort of infants and children who received MV for at least 12 h. Setting: Thirty-six medical surgical PICUs. Patients: All consecutive patients admitted to the PICUs during 2-month period. Measurements and main results: Of the 1893 patients admitted, 659 (35%) received MV for a median time of 4 days (25th percentile, 75%: 2, 6). Median of age was 13 months (25th percentile, 75%: 5, 48). Common indications for MV were acute respiratory failure (ARF) in 72% of the patients, altered mental status in 14% of the patients, and ARF on chronic pulmonary disease in 10% of the patients. Median length of stay in the PICUs was 8 days (25th percentile, 75%: 5, 13). Overall mortality rate in the PICUs was 15% (confidence interval 95%: 13-18) for the entire population, 50% (95% CI: 25-74) in patients who received MV because of acute respiratory distress syndrome, 24% (95% CI: 16-35) in patients who received MV for altered mental status and 16% (95% CI: 9-29) in patients who received MV for ARF on chronic pulmonary disease.

Like us, several studies on pediatric and adult populations have reported that patients requiring reintubation have a significantly higher mortality than patients who are successfully extubated [13, 30, 32, 33] ; however, in this study the mortality rate of reintubated patients was not different for the entire group who received MV. Again, it is possible for reintubated patients to begin a new course of MV where the probability of mortality is very similar to that of those patients who received MV for more than 12 h [17] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 140, "end": 144, "text": "[26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 145, "end": 148, "text": "27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 149, "end": 152, "text": "28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 153, "end": 156, "text": "29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 157, "end": 160, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 636, "end": 640, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 641, "end": 644, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 645, "end": 648, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 649, "end": 652, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 653, "end": 656, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 657, "end": 660, "text": "31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 894, "end": 898, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 899, "end": 902, "text": "30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 903, "end": 906, "text": "32,", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 907, "end": 910, "text": "33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1222, "end": 1226, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Several investigators have evaluated the survival of mechanically ventilated pediatric patients due to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS [18, 19, 20, 34] .
