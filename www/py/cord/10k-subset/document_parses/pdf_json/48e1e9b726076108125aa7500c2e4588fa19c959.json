Recent Findings Aggressive nutritional intervention is frequently required in the H&N cancer patient population. Rehabilitating nutrition during operative and nonoperative treatment improves compliance with treatment, quality of life, and clinical outcomes.

These differences notwithstanding, there is general acceptance that low body mass index (BMI), involuntary weight loss, and decreased recent nutritional intake represent attributes consistent with a clinical diagnosis of malnutrition.

More recent efforts to correlate nutritional risk with patient outcome led to the nutritional risk screening (NRS) 2002, whereby patients are stratified based upon their degree of undernutrition and the severity of the disease process (Table 1 ).

Pretreatment hypoalbuminemia has been correlated with decreased disease-specific survival in HNSCC patients [25] . In a recent analysis of patients with H&N cancer of all types who underwent surgical ablation, low preoperative serum albumin was associated with an increased rate of wound infection and poorer overall survival. This effect on overall survival was most pronounced in patients with HNSCC [26] . Total serum protein, hemoglobin, transferrin, prealbumin, retinol-binding protein, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, and other inflammatory markers have variously been employed as surrogate measures for nutritional status. Serum prealbumin was found to be significantly lower in malnourished patients than in well-nourished patients undergoing radiotherapy for HNSCC [27] . Despite the purported correlation of certain laboratory values with poor patient outcomes and the incessant desire to identify a biomarker or battery of biomarkers which could readily establish the diagnosis of malnutrition, current evidence does not support routine use of laboratory data to make treatment decisions regarding nutritional intervention. Expert consensus suggests that use of these serum markers in nutrition screening protocols ''fails to appreciate the role of the inflammatory response on acute phase proteins that are often used as primary indicators of nutrition status [28] .'' When the principles of aforementioned nutritional screening methodology are applied to the H&N cancer patient population, it is unsurprising that nutritional status is closely correlated with prognosis. The incidence of malnutrition is high in these patients and the extent of malnutrition is often substantial; unfortunately, the degree of nutritional derangement is invariably worse in patients with advanced-stage head and neck malignancies. Consequently, in order to provide appropriate nutritional intervention for at-risk patients, nutritional screening should be performed at the time of diagnosis. Percentage weight loss has shown good sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing malnutrition in the HNSCC patient population [11] and better accounts for malignancy-related nutritional derangement than BMI; this combined with a patient generated subjective global assessment (PG-SGA), ideally performed by a trained dietitian in the context of multidisciplinary cancer care, constitute basic requirements for measuring nutritional status in the H&N cancer patient.

Swallowing dysfunction is common in patients who present with HNSCC, and failure to recognize this condition can lead to worsening malnutrition or aspiration pneumonia, further debilitating the patient and hindering optimal treatment of the malignancy. Decisions regarding alimentation of HNSCC patients should therefore be made in a multidisciplinary treatment setting where speech language pathologists and dietitians can recommend interventions to preempt further nutritional depletion. Not infrequently, the degree of swallowing dysfunction will actually compel a certain course of treatment for the malignancy. An example of this situation is in the case of advanced laryngeal malignancies, where anticipated poor swallowing outcome after nonsurgical, ''organ-preserving'' chemoradiation often leads to a recommendation of primary surgical treatment via total laryngectomy instead [29] . The effect of nonsurgical treatment of HNSCC on nutrition is well known. Over half of all patients who undergo radiotherapy for HNSCC lose weight [30] . The reasons for this are varied and include radiation-induced xerostomia and taste alterations, mucositis, difficulty masticating and swallowing, uncontrolled nausea, or constipation. Patients who experience weight loss have a higher incidence and longer duration of treatment-related morbidity [31] .

Indeed, evidence exists that patients who undergo prophylactic feeding tube placement prior to chemoradiation treatment have a longer duration of reliance on the feeding tube than patients who are treated reactively [42, 43] .

Associated cost was ten times greater in the PEG group than the NG group, and the PEG group relied on the alternative enteral nutrition for a significantly longer period of time than the NG group. No difference in rate of chest infection was noted between the groups [49] . NG tube feeding is generally indicated if the anticipated length of requirement is less than four weeks. This route of nutrition has been associated with complications such as laryngeal irritation, persistent gastroesophageal reflux [50] , and patient discomfort; increased risk of NG tube displacement or blockage has been noted when compared to PEG tube-fed HNSCC patients [49, 51] . It is the authors' experience that NG tube feeding is most efficacious in the perioperative inpatient setting when temporary NPO status is required for healing or swallowing recovery is anticipated to occur quickly.

Complications of feeding tube placement, including site infection, leakage around the gastrostomy site, local pain, gastric erosion, bowel perforation, and intraperitoneal leakage, vary widely between studies, likely due to reporting bias and differences in the definition of complications [43, 50] . Open surgical gastrostomy tube placement is generally considered a more significant intervention and is often eschewed in favor of less invasive techniques. In a 2009 meta-analysis comparing PEG and RIG placement in 2379 HNSCC patients, Grant et al. found that major complication rates following PEG and RIG were 7.4% (95% CI 5.9-9.3%) and 8.9% (95% CI 7.0-11.2%), respectively.

Arginine has been identified as a conditionally essential amino acid when metabolic stress occurs. It is obtained primarily from dietary intake and protein breakdown. Not only does arginine serve as a substrate in protein synthesis, but it is also a precursor for nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, and bactericidal agent. Additionally, elevated arginine levels increase collagen synthesis and stimulate lymphocyte and growth hormone production in experimental models and have therefore been postulated to improve wound healing [77] . Because HNSCC patients are susceptible to postoperative infections and poor wound healing and are often fed via tube feeds during the initial postoperative period, there is great interest in arginine-supplemented tube feed formulas. While an initial study of preoperative arginine-supplemented nutrition in malnourished H&N cancer patients established no conclusive benefit in clinical outcomes [78] , this study might not have been adequately powered.

A more recent systematic review and meta-analysis of nutritional supplementation in H&N cancer patients again demonstrated a reduction in the overall LOS (6.8 days) for patients who received arginine-supplemented immunonutrition [84] . The reason for decreased hospital LOS was not completely elucidated, as there was infrequent reporting of postoperative complications such as pneumonia, diarrhea, or cardiovascular events in the included studies. While the evidence equivocates somewhat regarding the benefit of immunonutrition in preventing postoperative complications among all HNSCC patients undergoing ablative surgery [83 \u2022 ], those patients who are malnourished preoperatively have significantly fewer postoperative wound infections when isolated as a subgroup [85] .

The immunonutrition treatment arm demonstrated a significant reduction in pharyngeal leak and fistula formation (25 vs. 48%) and hospital LOS (2.8 days). Postoperative pneumonia was also decreased in the treatment cohort, but this difference did not achieve statistical significance. There was no difference in other postoperative wound infections, microvascular free flap failure or dehiscence, or bleeding complications between the two groups [76] . Another randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial included 32 malnourished HNSCC patients undergoing ablative surgery and found that patients who received arginine-supplemented nutrition for 10 days postoperatively had a median survival of 34.8 versus 20.7 months in the control group.
