Mutations in many different genes may be the cause of hereditary hearing loss, a sensory defect disorder. Effective methods for genetic diagnosis are clearly needed to provide clinical management. Owing to the broad genetic basis of this condition, clinical assay of such a highly heterogeneous disorder is expensive and time consuming. In ASPUA, the allele discrimination reaction is carried out in solution by multiplex allele-specific PCR and a universal solid phase array with different tag probes is used to display the PCR result. The purpose of developing the ASPUA platform was to utilize the rapidity and simplicity of the amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) with the detection power of microarray hybridization. This is the first report of the combination of these two technologies, which allow for the completion of allele-specific detection of 11 of the most frequent mutations causing hereditary hearing loss in under 5 hr. The ASPUA platform was validated by accurately analyzing 141 patient samples that had been previously genotyped for GJB2, GJB3, SLC26A4, and MTRNR1. In addition, we also developed a simplified assay by using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads instead of fluorescence for signal display that can be assessed through a conventional light microscope. We demonstrate that the ASPUA platform is rapid, cost-effective, and easily-used, and is especially appropriate for mutation detection in clinical genetic diagnostics.

Reducing the concentration of the AS primer can also increase the discrimination power of this method; however, the efficiency of the two measures varied over a range of PCR conditions. To study these effects we have chosen the wild-type primer of m.1555A4G mutation as the assay target as it has a T residue at the 3 0 -end and is often poorly discriminated (data not shown). Artificial mismatch was introduced to the AS primer at positions three, five, and nine bases from the 3 0 -end (called m.1555A4G-W3, -W5, and -W9), respectively. The discrimination ratio (DR) of the natural wild-type primer is low because of the T-G mismatch between the wild-type primer and the mutant target. Decreasing the primer concentration can increase the specificity, but this measure also greatly reduces the amplification efficiency. In contrast, the presence of artificial mismatches near the 3 0 -end of primers can enhance the discrimination ratio with little deleterious influence on the amplification efficiency. As the artificial mismatch is positioned further from the 3 0 -end the specificity is seen to decrease. The m.1555A4G-W3 primer maintains high discrimination specificity during signal amplification in the presence of increasing amounts of mutant template, or increasing concentrations of magnesium.

Even mutations that are adjacent, such as the two loci nine bases apart in the GJB3 gene [Xia et al., 1998 ], can be accurately detected.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 620, "end": 637, "text": "[Xia et al., 1998", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "During optimization of the assay we observed that the use of HotStarTaq DNA Polymerase was crucial to performance of multiplex ASPUA, as it can prevent the formation of primer dimers to a large extent. Primer dimers both reduce the efficiency of amplification of some alleles, and cause some false-positive signals to be generated and detected at the PCR negative control. A minimum 25 ng of gDNA is enough for efficient ASPUA detection in the 15-ml reaction volume. If the amount of patient sample is limiting, MDA can be used to increase template abundance before ASPUA allowing as little as 1 ng of starting gDNA to be successfully genotyped. Artificial mismatches can also be introduced close to the 3 0 -end to enhance the specificity of AS primers by lowering the stability of the primer/template complex, preventing the mismatched primer from extending efficiently. Artificial mismatches can improve the specificity greatly and discriminate efficiently over a wide range of PCR conditions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In the patient study, we tested 141 samples to validate the accuracy of ASPUA, of which 18 of the samples were blind test samples. The results of 141 samples were fully concordant with the initial genotype information of the supplier laboratories. Signal intensity variation was found among different samples. Because the patient DNA samples were supplied by several laboratories, the DNA quality varied to some degree. But this difference did not influence the assay outcomes and all the positive signals meet the assay criteria. One sample was found to carry the m.1555A4G mutation but the patient showed no clinical manifestations. For such a patient, aminoglycoside antibiotics should be avoided to prevent induced development of deafness. During preparation of this manuscript, we applied ASPUA to a further 515 patient samples and the results were fully concordant with direct sequencing.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "We have validated the ASPUA platform with only 11 mutations, many less than reported using APEX methods [Gardner et al., 2006; Cremers et al., 2007] . The low number of abundant mutations detected by the current ASPUA microarray platform was intentional, as it allowed for sufficient numbers of samples of each genotype to be collected for regulatory-requested, statistically-verifiable data. In the future, we need to analyze more samples to ensure the accuracy of the ASPUA platform over a wider diversity of quality of patient samples, and over a wider range of different genotype combinations. Most of the mutations in this work are frequently found in Chinese hearing loss patients. For example, our preliminary study on 1,190 Chinese nonsyndromic hearing impairment (NSHI) patients found that the c.235delC mutation accounts for 88.8% (222/250) of the patients who carry the GJB2 mutation and the c.299_300delAT and c.176_191del16 mutation was found in 24.8% (62/250) and 7.6% (19/250) of these patients, respectively, as some of the patients carry compound mutations. Dai et al. [2006] studied 38 Chinese patients with enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) and found that 91.4% of the patients carry at least one mutation in the SLC26A4 gene, and patients who carry the c.919-2A4G (IVS7-2A4G) and p.His723Arg mutation accounted for 71.9% and 25%, respectively. Liu et al. [2006] reported 3.43% (63/1,836) of the Chinese NSHI patients carry the m.1555A4G mutation. The Connexin 31 gene (GJB3) was first cloned in China, and the p.Arg180X and p.Glu183Lys mutations were associated with hearing loss [Xia et al., 1998 ]. Three mutations that are prevalent in Caucasoid or Ashkenazi Jewish patients were also chosen to expand the detection spectrum of our methods. For example, the c.35delG mutation accounted for 85% of GJB2 mutations in families with recessive nonsyndromic deafness from Spain and Italy [Estivill et al., 1998 ] and the c.167delT mutation accounted for 40% of the mutant alleles in the Ashkenazi Jewish population [Sobe et al., 2000] .

We have shown that separation of amplification reactions into different tubes with compatible combinations of primers and HotStar DNA polymerase permits efficient amplification, even with a range of DNA qualities and quantities. Increasing the number of reaction tubes to provide for additional alleles and gene loci is the simplest approach to increase gene testing, and the addition of a few new gene loci to each tube could also be readily tested, and if efficiency remains high, adopted. We have also demonstrated that alleles with low hybridization efficiency can be markedly improved by inclusion of deliberate mismatches near to the 3 0 -discriminatory nucleotide-a measure that could be tested with any newly added suboptimal alleles.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The ASPUA platform is simple to use, and although it is currently low-throughput, it can readily be expanded. Other deafness analysis platforms have different design formats. The allele-specific oligonucleotide biochip of Siemering et al. [2006] involves seven steps from PCR to interpretation of results and takes more than 1 day to perform. The APEX method [Gardner et al., 2006] involves six steps and is completed in 6 hr, yet it employs multichannel scanners and four-color fluorescence labeling, which adds considerable expense to the setup and running costs. In contrast, current ASPUA analysis of four samples on a four-subarray chip can be completed in 5 hr with only four steps: DNA extraction (1 hr), PCR (2.5 hr), hybridization (1 hr), scanning and automatic characterization of results (0.5 hr), avoiding the need for amplicon purification and several other steps required by other platforms. The genetic heterogeneity of deafness makes it necessary to undertake multigene detection. Yet, with the current method one could readily increase either the number of genes or the number of mutations to about 50 with almost no increase in the time for analysis. The number of samples analyzed could also be increased with some small time cost. If say 48 samples were analyzed (requiring 12 four-subarray chips) the total analysis time, including scanning and interpretation, would increase by about a further 40 minutes due to sample handling.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 222, "end": 245, "text": "Siemering et al.

However, conventional methods such as RFLP or dot blot allele specific oligonucleotide (ASO) both become labor-intensive when the number of mutations or samples is increased. In ASPUA, the PCR products can be used to hybridize directly without the need of post-PCR purification or dye-labeled ddNTP extension, which saves some costs. The flexibility of the universal array also contributes to the cost reduction because the same universal array format can be developed for use for completely different gene mutation assays. It is desirable to avoid the use of expensive instruments and to limit costs significantly for general clinical diagnostic settings and to provide a low cost method for laboratories in less developed regions of China. To this end we have employed magnetic bead-labeling to achieve visible light-assisted detection. The hybridization results can then be visualized through a light microscope or by naked eye. Several groups have also addressed the development of simple and specific methods with the minimal instrumentation requirements. Taton et al. [2000] developed a sandwich hybridization DNA array using oligonucleotide-modified gold nanoparticle probes coupled with signal amplification by use of silver deposition.

The ASPUA universal array makes the multiplex detection highly flexible, and the numbers of gene loci detected can be increased if warranted. The microarray could also be redesigned with a greater number of subarrays so that much larger numbers of patient samples could be tested simultaneously.
