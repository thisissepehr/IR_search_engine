The reality, however, is that the use of NHPs in research is still subject to limitations 23 . As highly intelligent animals, NHPs require much more stimulation and environmental enrichment than rodents, and must be housed in spacious containment facilities subject to rigorous monitoring regulations 23 . Additionally, the cost of one NHP experiment, when taking into account housing, personnel, and equipment costs is equivalent to that of hundreds of mice 23 . Significant resources and expertise are especially essential for NHP experiments involving intravenous infusions, phlebotomy, or vital sign measurements; these procedures generally require sedation, which when administered to septic animals can worsen cardiopulmonary instability (similar to patients). While such sepsis experiments have been reported for chimpanzees 40 , baboons 70 , and rhesus macaques 114 , they have required provision of ICU-level support (e.g., mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, fluids). An alternative strategy involves inserting and tethering indwelling intravascular catheters or vital sign recording devices to a harness worn by the animal 19, 115 . Such devices can continuously administer fluids or medications, and measure telemetry, heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature 19, 115 . The implantation procedure itself is still a surgery that requires technical expertise, equipment, sedation, and a recovery period, but obviates the need for and inherent risks of sedation while the animal is septic. There can be device complications, however, such as catheterassociated infections 116 , which could confound sepsis experiments.

The 2006 Weatherall Report commissioned by medical groups in the United Kingdom concluded that the use of NHPs in medical research is justified, provided that 1) there are no alternative means (e.g. lower animals or in vitro work) to answer the biological question; 2) the NHP model is representative of the human disease; 3) there are adequate regulations in place to ensure the welfare of NHPs; and 4) the work significantly advances human health 117 . The report further qualifies that each use of NHPs for medical research should be adjudicated on a case-by-case basis 117 . This ethical justification is predicated on the utilitarian principle that suffering by a small number of NHPs may be acceptable if the research leads to substantial benefits to many humans 118 . Applications of this principle include using NHP studies to prevent a harmful drug from going to clinical trial, or conversely, redirecting resources towards drugs that show significant benefits in NHPs 119 . Risks associated with this calculus can be attenuated by minimizing the number of animals used, and be ensuring adequate attention to animal welfare 118 . The former can be addressed by changes to experimental design, such as use of \"rolling controls\" where the control group changes by one or two animals every experiment, or \"before-and-after\" studies where an animal serves as its own control. Strategies to address the latter including providing the animals with adequate food, water, space, enrichment, and social interactions 117 . The latter can also be addressed by using humane endpoints, or predetermined changes in animal physiology, rather than experimental endpoints, such as mortality. Furthermore, distinctions between different NHP species are likely relevant. For instance, the use of use great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, orangutans) in medical research was banned in the European Union in 2011 and phased out in the U.S. in 2013 119 . These ethical and policy issues are far from settled, and the justification for using monkeys or lesser apes (siamangs and gibbons) in medical research going forward must be continually reassessed. At the very least, the authors propose that their use should be limited to therapeutic studies (rather than mechanistic ones), which are more likely to directly impact human health.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 552, "end": 555, "text": "117", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 676, "end": 679, "text": "117", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 872, "end": 875, "text": "118", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 1081, "end": 1084, "text": "119", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 1236, "end": 1239, "text": "118", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 1619, "end": 1622, "text": "117", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 2045, "end": 2048, "text": "119", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Limitations of NHP models"}, {"text": "NHP models mimic human sepsis more faithfully than any other species because of anatomic, molecular, and physiological similarities.

TNF-\u03b1 further activates other proand anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6. Both cytokines promote hypercoagulability by upregulating tissue factor (TF) expression.
