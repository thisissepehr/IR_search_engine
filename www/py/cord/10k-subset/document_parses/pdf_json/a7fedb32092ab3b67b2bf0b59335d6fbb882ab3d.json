[6] [7] [8] [9] Clinical findings at the time of diagnosis indicated advanced age, baseline renal function, lower serum albumin levels, hypertension, and proteinuria to be risk factors for ESKD. 7, 8, [10] [11] [12] A multicenter retrospective cohort study, using the Japan Renal Biopsy Registry, demonstrated that age older than 65 years and hypoalbuminemia were the independent prognostic factors for a decline in renal function. 13 Although gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) because of various causes, such as hemorrhagic erosions and ulcers, is common, 9, 14, 15 its impact on renal prognosis in patients with IgAVN remains uncertain. In addition, patients with IgAV often visit primary care physicians with common complaints such as palpable purpura, arthritis, and gastrointestinal symptoms, so that study on the prognosis of IgAV is relevant for general physicians. Therefore, we conducted this retrospective cohort study to investigate the effects of GIB on renal prognosis and mortality; furthermore, we examined the factors that affect the progression to ESKD in adult patients with IgAVN. 16 We performed a chart review of patients with IgAVN using the Teine Keijinkai Renal Biopsy Registry (TK-RBR) at Teine Keijinkai Medical Center and gathered information between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2018.",

This may be biologically plausible because GIB can cause anemia and subsequent hypo-oxygenation of the kidney, contributing to the development of ESKD. 19 Although GIB is one of the most acute life-threatening clinical manifestations, 9 only a few studies have reported an association between GIB and long-term progression to ESKD. A recent retrospective cohort study in France 6 reported that 43/137 (31%) patients with IgAV had GIB; however, they did not investigate the effect of GIB on the renal prognosis as we did in our study.",

This may simply be because of the small sample size (type II error). Interestingly, we observed a relatively higher mortality of 2/30 (6.7%) patients than that reported in prior studies 6, 18 despite aggressive treatment with high-dose corticosteroids. The reasons remain unclear, but one possible explanation may be related to the inclusion of more severe cases in our study: The baseline sCr levels (1.21 \u00b1 0.92 mg/ dL vs 0.91 \u00b1 0.46 mg/dL) and the percentage of urine protein, that is, >3 g/d (32% vs 23%), were higher in our cohort than in the study performed using the Japan Renal Biopsy Registry. 13 We observed that GIB has a statistically significant association with ESKD with an adjustment for patients' age and gender; however, this result should be interpreted cautiously because it has a wide 95% confidence interval. Besides, GIB was not statistically significant after further adjustment with urinary protein levels and hypertension. Therefore, we could not conclude that GIB is an independent prognostic factor of ESKD in this study. Baseline characteristics, including age, BUN, and sCr, were not included in the multivariable analysis because they were similar in the two groups.",

To evaluate the effectiveness of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents, large-scale prospective studies are required.The present study had several limitations. First, background characteristics were different between patients with positive and negative GIB. We tried to control for confounding factors using multivariable analysis to evaluate the prognostic factors; however, unmeasured confounders may still exist. Second, the retrospective study design was limited to the interpretation of our results. Third, the sample size of the present study might be insufficient to evaluate the influence of GIB on renal prognosis. The sample size also restricted the construction of models incorporating all potential confounding factors, especially BUN and sCr, and failed to introduce corrections in independent variables for multiple comparisons. Fourth, the log-rank tests in our analyses were not adjusted for potential confounders; therefore, our results should be interpreted with caution. Fifth, the study population consisted solely of Japanese patients, so these findings might not be generalizable to other ethnic groups. Validation studies in other settings should be",
