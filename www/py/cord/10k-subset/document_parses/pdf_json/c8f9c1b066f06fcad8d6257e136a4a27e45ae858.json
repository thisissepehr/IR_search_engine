Ongoing monitoring and management of the biodiversity in those reserves is an equally important, but often neglected or poorly executed, part of the conservation process. In this paper we address one of the first and most important steps in designing a monitoring program -deciding what to monitor. We present a strategy for prioritizing species for monitoring and management in multispecies conservation plans. We use existing assessments of threatened status, and the degree and spatial and temporal extent of known threats to link the prioritization of species to the overarching goals and objectives of the conservation plan. We consider both broad and localized spatial scales to capture the regional conservation context and the practicalities of local management and monitoring constraints. Spatial scales that are commensurate with available data are selected. We demonstrate the utility of this strategy through application to a set of 85 plants and animals in an established multispecies conservation plan in San Diego County, California, USA. We use the prioritization to identify the most prominent risk factors and the habitats associated with the most threats to species. The protocol highlighted priorities that had not previously been identified and were not necessarily intuitive without systematic application of the criteria; many high-priority species have received no monitoring attention to date, and lower-priority species have. We recommend that in the absence of clear focal species, monitoring threats in highly impacted habitats may be a way to circumvent the need to monitor all the targeted species.",

In an effort to increase the conservation value of HCPs, the number of 'covered species' included in these plans has grown from one species in the 1980s to nearly 200 species for plans currently considered.

The importance of explicitly considering budgets in the formulation and allocation phases of monitoring and management has been highlighted in the literature (Haight et al ., 2002; Field et al ., 2004 Field et al ., , 2005 Hauser et al ., 2006) . Most studies assume that budgets are known and constant. However, when monitoring and management are conducted in an adaptive framework and are administered by a consortium of government agencies, nongovernment organizations, and private land owners, the total budget for monitoring activities is often unknown at the outset, changes over time, and depends somewhat on monitoring and management priorities. Volunteer groups also play an increasing role in monitoring and managing local biodiversity and can contribute to ongoing monitoring with minimal to no expenditure (Hoyer et al ., 2001; Markovchick-Nicholls et al . in press) , and there may be other ways to leverage funding for monitoring. Hence, while it is sensible to explicitly consider the available budget in planning monitoring and management activities, in practice it is prudent to devise a prioritization scheme for monitoring that is flexible enough to deal with statutory standards and realistic uncertainties and constraints.",

Rarely can all components of biodiversity be monitored: some triage must occur at the outset (Possingham et al ., 2001 ). This step is crucial for the implementation of a monitoring plan because it lays the foundation for all future activities and decisions. Once a monitoring program has gained momentum it may be difficult to change priorities because of perceived or actual 'return on investments' in components for which the monitoring budget has already been allocated. Hence, it is important to base prioritization decisions on sound science and directly relate them to the goals and objectives of the conservation plan as a first step in structuring a monitoring program.",

The first is to assess the status of biodiversity, and the second is to measure the effectiveness of management actions. These two motivations are tightly linked -decisions to take management action will be based on assessments of status and trends, while evaluations of the impact of management rely on assessments of status and trends in reference and managed scenarios. The major difference is that evaluations of management impact may not necessarily involve direct measurement of the intended beneficiary of the action. For example, if the management action is the abatement of a known threat, then the impact on the threat itself may be measured. Hence, it is important to distinguish between these two motivations for monitoring because this will determine monitoring priorities. In this paper, we address the first of these, prioritizing species for the purpose of monitoring status and trends, because this is most certainly the precursor of informed management decisions and links directly to monitoring of management impacts.",

We demonstrate the utility of this strategy through application to a set of 85 plants and animals in an established multispecies conservation plan in San Diego County, California, USA. While this strategy is in a similar vein as others proposed in the literature (Lambeck, 1997; Committee of Scientists, 1999; Holthausen et al ., 1999; Noon et al ., 1999; Hilty & Merenlender, 2000; Andelman et al ., 2001; Groves, 2003) , we apply it to an established multispecies conservation plan to demonstrate its value for identifying monitoring priorities in a systematic way.",

Its primary goal is to conserve natural communities at the ecosystem scale before species decline to the point of requiring protection under federal or state Endangered Species Acts, while allowing 'compatible land uses' (US Fish & Wildlife Service, 1996) . The MSCP is also intended to provide protection and management for species already listed under the federal and state Endangered Species Acts to offset incidental take in developed areas outside the preserve. As of 2004, over 51,800 ha had been included in the preserve and lands continue to be added by the 14 participating jurisdictions and wildlife agencies (San Diego Association of Governments, HabiTrak GIS data). The 85 covered species targeted for protection under the San Diego MSCP include 39 animal and 46 plant species (see Appendices S1 and S2 in Supplementary Material). The covered species list comprises rare, threatened, and endangered species, as well as common and endemic species and species intended to serve as focal species and indicators of reserve connectivity.

The MSCP lists several objectives for biological monitoring, each of which will require a separate prioritization and monitoring program: document ecological status and trends, evaluate the effectiveness of management activities, provide new data on species populations and wildlife movement, and evaluate the indirect impacts of threats.

This protocol was intended to identify at-risk and focal species for viability assessments. Since the overarching monitoring goals of the MSCP are to monitor the status and trends of the covered species and status and trends are directly related to viability, we used the protocols recommended in Andelman et al . (2001) as a starting point, and modified these as appropriate for the particular application of prioritizing covered species for monitoring in the MSCP. The ultimate goal is to prioritize the covered species into two main groups: at-risk species that are those deemed to be at risk of decline or extinction under current conditions or in the face of short-or long-term threats, and focal species whose 'status and trend provide insights into the integrity of the larger ecological system to which it belongs' (Federal Register 65, 67,580, 2000) . The first group is constructed by considering those species that fall into the highest risk category as determined by some at-risk categorization scheme (e.g. The World Conservation Union (IUCN) Red List, NatureServe, Federal or State listings). Within the focal species group, the aim is to represent all relevant combinations of habitat association and risk factor (denoted generally as HA/RF). Where multiple species occur for each HA/RF pair, further prioritization is achieved by considering the spatial and temporal scale of threats, with the aim of selecting a representative species that can serve as a focal species for that HA/RF pair.",

Global scales are too broad to be of relevance to the MSCP, whereas the incorporated preserve is too small a scale to capture true risk to taxa. While monitoring and management will ultimately occur only on MSCP preserve lands, it is important to consider risk factors at a broader spatial scale, somewhat independently of the preserve, so that assigned risk status and the resulting prioritization is not purely an artefact of the way the preserve has been designated. This is especially pertinent when all proposed areas have not yet been incorporated into the preserve. In order to implement the protocol at a spatial scale relevant to San Diego County, we have chosen a two-tiered approach: the first tier focuses on selecting species and allocating them to broad categories, while the second tier ranks the species within each category. In the first tier, species are assigned to broad risk categories using State Ranks for California (and supplemented with Federal and IUCN listings) to capture risk status at the broad scale of the state.

First, the steps assume the pool of species is large, perhaps much larger than the covered species list (as was the case for the USDA Forest Service species viability assessments). Ideally, the first tier approach to prioritization should be used to identify covered species for a multispecies conservation plan at the outset (Margules & Pressey, 2000; Groves, 2003) . The MSCP covered species list is already the result of an ad hoc prioritization. Hence, application of steps 1-6 may not reduce the candidate species for monitoring any further. Second, for species not listed as rare, threatened, or endangered, it is highly uncertain that they actually do serve as surrogates due to a lack of documented rationale and scientific justification for their inclusion as covered focal species. Third, insufficient resources may exist to monitor all species identified from steps 1-6 as at-risk or focal species. At the very least, the MSCP should conserve (and monitor) at-risk species. The strategy used for ranking the covered species within each Risk Group according to degree and spatial extent of risk is as follows: 1 Species are grouped according to their at-risk ranking into Risk Groups 1, 2, and 3 in descending order of risk level (from i above). 2 Species in each of the Risk Groups are ranked by the number of high-level threats ('high' from ii above) facing each species, then ranked further by their total number of threats. Temporal response to threats is used as a tie breaker where necessary, with species having short-term responses ranked higher.",

The top five threats to animals are habitat loss, altered hydrology, invasive species, predation, and recreation. The five most prominent threats for plants and animals, respectively, impact most of the covered plant and animal species. Figure 1 shows the number of species that have been studied or monitored to date, ranked by risk group (see also Appendices S1 and S2 in Supplementary Material). It is important to note that these include a wide variety of data collection activities including species inventories, baseline determinations of plant cover, and population surveys. Data analysis for the purpose of informing management decisions or future monitoring direction has been patchy. So while data have been collected for many of the covered species (see Appendices S1 and S2 in Supplementary Material) over the period of 1995-2005, they have not been used in an integrated multispecies monitoring program (see Hierl et al ., 2005 for details of data collected). The results in Figure 1 show that there is no obvious pattern or rationale for current monitoring decisions in terms of how such decisions relate to the goals and objectives of the MSCP. Indeed, many highly at-risk species (Risk Group 1) receive no monitoring at all, whereas half of the Risk Group 3 animal species are monitored. Furthermore, data collection has been a priority for some covered species that are not currently known to occur within the MSCP reserve system (even though potentially suitable habitat for them exists).",

The information compiled in Figs 2 and 3 can assist in prioritizing habitat types for monitoring based on threats to covered species. It should be noted, however, that 'habitat' is a species-based concept. For the purpose of MSCP species monitoring, it is only relevant to prioritize habitats in terms of the covered species occurring there and the threats those species face within their habitat (as opposed to the threats to the habitat itself). While threats to the habitat itself are significant risk factors, they are a subset of the many threats covered species face. Species life-history traits and their response to all major risk factors need to be considered in designing habitat monitoring and such monitoring should be performed in conjunction with other species-specific monitoring. It will be insufficient to monitor habitat cover through aerial photographs, for instance, when predation is a major risk factor for a given species. Habitat monitoring, performed in an appropriate way for the associated covered species, could have the greatest value if performed in areas where the most covered species occur.",

Despite many years of effort, the utility of focal species remains controversial (National Research Council, 1995; Niemi et al ., 1997; Lindenmeyer, 1999; Andelman & Fagan, 2000) . We argue that even though focal species concepts are often invoked in the selection of conservation targets, a risk-based approach to species prioritization is better justified for status and trend monitoring. This is because of the necessity of directly managing and monitoring at-risk species, the paucity of evidence establishing the validity of focal species in many cases, and the difficulties in structuring a monitoring plan to capture status and trends of focal species that are meaningful for the broader biodiversity (Rubinoff, 2001; Lindenmeyer et al ., 2002) . In the absence of clear focal species and insufficient resources to monitor all covered species, how can we gauge the status and trends of species that are not high risk and cannot be monitored directly? We suggest that the prioritization methods presented here can be used to make monitoring decisions about an alternative indicator of status and trend-threats. The results in Appendix S4 provide information on the most prominent threats and the species impacted by them in the MSCP. Figures 2 and 3 reveal the habitats containing the most threats to species. This information can be used to identify the most serious threats to covered species and where those threats occur. Six threats stand out as the most serious for most of the covered species: habitat loss, invasive species, off-road vehicles, recreation/human disturbance, altered fire regime, and altered hydrology. While it is always preferable to monitor the covered species directly if resources allow, threats may be a more feasible alternative for monitoring status and trends. They may also be more reliable and relevant than focal species for a monitoring plan because they directly link to management (as highlighted previously by Salafsky & Margoluis, 1999) .",

While prioritization for monitoring status and trends of target species is an important first step in such a framework, it is insufficient on its own as a tool for ensuring a successful conservation plan. Ongoing management and subsequent evaluation will be necessary to determine if the conservation plan is meeting its stated objectives. It may also be necessary to monitor and evaluate additional components of biodiversity, such as communities or ecosystems, to determine if the objectives of the conservation plan are being met.
