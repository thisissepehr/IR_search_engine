However, the data were derived from observational studies of very low quality and with several methodological limitations, including other clinical indications of corticosteroids as a major potential concern. Thus, it is impossible to be sure that patients who were treated with corticosteroids did not have other corticosteroid indications or were not more severely ill in the first place. We have previously reported that corticosteroid therapy does not improve survival in patients with primary viral pneumonia [12] .

This allowed us to study two comparable (almost identical) cohorts: (1) the corticosteroid-treated group and (2) the control group, comprising patients who did not receive corticosteroid treatment. PS matching analysis attempts to compare outcomes between patients who have a similar distribution of all the covariates measured. An attractive feature of this approach is that it uses the entire sample. Using the PS methodology, all patients were assigned a weight between 0 and 1; this propensity-matched cohort was generated by choosing the best weight balance. This method optimizes the post-weighting balance of covariates between groups and, in this way, approximates the conditions of random site-of-treatment assignment. To assess our PS adjustment, we checked for adequate overlap in propensity scores between groups with a crossvalidation model.

First, we computed the cumulative incidence function (CIF) of death over time. At time t, the CIF defines the probability of dying in the ICU by that time t when the population can be discharged alive.

We found that MV, asthma, COPD, and hematological disease were independently associated with corticosteroid use. Severe acute lung injury following influenza infection is characterized by uncontrolled local and systemic inflammation [36] [37] [38] . This damage is caused by an excessive host innate response with exaggerated migration of macrophages, neutrophils, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to classic exudative diffuse alveolar damage, severe necrotizing bronchiolitis with predominantly neutrophilic inflammation, and intense alveolar hemorrhage [4] . Corticosteroids have several anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and vascular properties, including inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reduction of leukocyte trafficking, stimulation of apoptosis in T-lymphocytes, and maintenance of endothelial integrity and vascular permeability.

A recent Cochrane review [14] reported an association between corticosteroid therapy and increased mortality.

Sixty-five pairs were generated, and the 90-day mortality rate was higher in the corticosteroid group (54% vs. 31%, p = 0.004). These data are in concordance with our results; however, the mortality rate in our patients was substantially lower. This discrepancy might be due to several factors, including differences in severity of illness, endpoint observational period (ICU mortality vs. 90-day mortality), and early recognition vs. standard of care. Interestingly, Kim et al. reported that half of the patients treated with corticosteroids received hydrocortisone, a non-standard co-adjuvant treatment of pneumonia. The authors did not report the treatment indication for corticosteroid therapy; thus many patients in this cohort may have received corticosteroids for a reason other than influenza-induced acute lung injury. In contrast, our population comprised only patients treated with corticosteroids as an co-adjuvant therapy for severe viral pneumonia, excluding patients with other indications for corticosteroids (such as shock). Therefore, with a homogeneous group of critically ill patients, and after carefully controlling for important confounders through a PS matching analysis and competing risks analysis, we provide robust evidence to support the association between corticosteroid administration and increased mortality.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 152, "end": 167, "text": "Kim et al.

We are not able to explain this finding using our database because we did not collect data on the degree of COPD severity. COPD patients may be at an advanced stage of disease. This condition, and other uncontrolled confounding factors, may explain the higher mortality among COPD patients even after excluding patients with COPD exacerbation. The main strengths of this study are the homogeneous and uniform population, the high number of critically ill patients included in our multicenter study, data regarding the kind/indication of corticosteroid treatment, and the carefully executed analysis to resolve confounding factors including the presence of competing risks. However, we recognize some limitations. First, our results were obtained in a homogeneous population of patients with influenza pneumonia and cannot be extrapolated to other populations. Second, we did not review the duration of viral shedding or appearance of drug-resistant virus in either group. Third, PS matching analysis may also be a limitation, because this method may not reflect the possible biases in observational studies, and some residual confounding may persist. However, as PS matching analysis can balance the population and reduces observational bias, it is the best evidence available for physicians. Fourth, data on MV of patients were not recorded. Lung-protective ventilation is the standard of care for patients with acute lung injury/ARDS because of the evidence that it decreases mortality. Although we did not provide data regarding ventilation of patients, it is broadly accepted in this country that applying protective ventilation improves results and is one of the national quality indicators.
