            "text": "We have studied the pathogenesis of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) pneumonitis in immunocompetent ICR mice and in mice treated with cyclophosphamide (CP). Intranasal infection of immunocompetent mice with MCMV resulted in transient and self-limited pulmonary lesions. When mice were given 200 mg/kg of CP one day before virus infection, transient splenic atrophy and subsequent splenic hypertrophy were induced, and the lesions in the lung were markedly augmented in their number and size although there was no significant enhancement of the virus growth. The augmentation coincided with the period of splenic hypertrophy. A marked increase in the number of pulmonary lesions was also induced in mice given 100 mg/kg of CP every 4 days following the initial dose of 200 mg/kg. In these mice, however, continuous splenic atrophy and augmented replication of MCMV in the lung were observed. When the activity of xanthine oxidase (XO) in lung tissue homogenates was measured, the activity was found to significantly increase after intranasal infection with MCMV irrespective of CP administration and there was a good correlation between the elevation of XO activity and the degree of pathological changes in the lung. In addition, we found that the administration of allopurinol, a specific inhibitor of XO and superoxide dismutase, a superoxide radical scavenger, reduced the number of the pulmonary lesions. These results suggest that superoxide radicals are involved in the pathogenesis of MCMV-associated pneumonitis in ICR mice.",

            "text": "Infection with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in severely immunocompromised patients, particularly in those who have had allogeneic bone marrow or solid organ transplantation, or who have the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and HCMVassociated interstitial pneumonitis is now a major cause of death in those patients. However, the pathogenesis of HCMV pneumonitis is not completely understood. On clinical setting, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is often associated with HCMV-associated interstitial pneumonitis after bone marrow transplantation; no cases of HCMV pneumonitis were found among 100 recipients of syngeneic bone marrow from identical twins in which no GVHD occurred [2] . HCMV pneumonitis after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation have not been successfully treated with ganciclovir (9-[2-hydroxy-l-(hydroxymethyl)ethoxymethyl]guanine) alone despite its excellent antiviral activity, but better therapeutic effects of ganciclovir were obtained when the drug was given in combination with anti-HCMV immunogtobulin [10, 23] . In murine models of CMV pneumonitis, immunosuppression is often required to produce pathological changes [6] . However, immunosuppression is not mandatory [16, 22, 25] . On the contrary, immunosuppression inhibited the formation of pulmonary lesions in an animal model [27] . From these studies, it is suggested that CMV pneumonitis is an immunopathological condition [-13 ]. Similar observations have been made in murine models of influenza virus pneumonitis, it has been suggested that the lethal effect of influenza infection is determined by immunopathological consequences of the host rather than the direct cytopathic effect of viral replication [14] . Furthermore, recent studies have shown that the enhanced production of superoxide radicals by xanthine oxidase (XO) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of influenza virus-induced pulmonary infection [1, 193. In this study, we have established a model of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) pneumonitis in ICR mice, measured XO activity in tung tissues, and evaluated the effect of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and allopurinol in this model. The degree of the pathological changes expressed as the number of foci correlated well with XO activity but not with virus titers, and both SOD and allopurinot administration suppressed the formation of pulmonary lesions. We suggest that superoxide radicals generated by XO are involved in the pathogenesis of MCMV-associated pneumonitis in mice.",

[27] ; one group of mice (CP 1 mice) was administrated 200 mg/kg of CP one day before virus inoculation and the other group of mice (CPn mice) was administrated 100 rag/ kg of CP every four days after an initial dose of 200 mg/kg one day before virus infection. As reported previously [27] , a single dose of CP (200 mg/kg) resulted in marked splenic atrophy on day 3 but induced marked hypertrophy on day 10 ( Fig. 1 A, panel b) . There was no significant difference in the virus growth between MCMV-infected mice and MCMV-infected CP 1 mice (Fig. 1 B,  panels a and b) . However, a single dose of CP before MCMV infection resulted in a marked increase in the number of foci in the lung (Fig. 1 C, panel b) . No mortality was seen. On the other hand, MCMV-infected CPn mice exhibited a marked increase in MCMV titers in the lung on and after day 6 ( Fig. 1 B, panel  c) . In this regimen of CP administration spleen remained atrophic (Fig. 1 A,  panel c) . About a half of mice were killed by day 15 and mortality reached 100% by day 20. The number of foci on day 6 in MCMV-infected CPn mice was similar to that of mice infected with MCMV alone, but markedly increased thereafter ( Fig. 1 C, panels a and c) . It was also noted that there was a marked increase in the lung index (lung weight/body weight ratio) ( Fig. 1 D, panel c) .",

In addition, it has been shown that NK cells are involved in the pathogenesis of MCMV interstitial pneumonitis [22] . Therefore, the enhanced pathological changes observed in MCMV-.infected CP 1 mice could be due to augmented NK cell and cytotoxic T cell activities against MCMV infection. On the other hand, a marked increase in the number of loci was also observed in MCMV-infected CPn mice, but histopathological features of the lesions were different from those observed in MCMV-infected CP 1 mice. The foci in the CPn mice were characterized by lesser extent of mononuclear cell infiltration and much more content of fibrin. Since the spleens of CPn mice remained atrophic, the immunological potential is considered to be kept suppressed during the period of observation. Thus it seems that severe pneumonitis in MCMV-infected CPn mice was the consequence of enhanced virus replication in the lung rather than augmented immune response.",

It has been further demonstrated that the activity of XO, which generates superoxide radicals, increases in plasma of ARDS [12] and in the serum and lung of influenza-associated pneumonitis [1, 19] , suggesting that XO mediates lung injury through the production of toxic oxygen metabolites. In the present study, we found that XO activity in the lung significantly increased after intranasal infection with MCMV, and that there was a good correlation between the elevation of XO activity and the development of pathological changes in lung tissues. Moreover, allopurinol, a specific inhibitor of XO, and SOD, a specific superoxide radical scavenger were found to reduce the number of the focal lesions in MCMV-infected CP 1 mice. These results suggest that superoxide radicals are involved in the pathogenesis of MCMV-associated pneumonitis in ICR mice. Viral infection itself or host immune response to virus-infected cells may raise the level of superoxide radicals in the microenvironment around the infected cells, probably by accelerating the conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase to XO. Since superoxide radicals can directly cause cellular injury [28] and also act to produce chemotactic substances that attract additional leukocytes to the site of inflammation [18] , a rise of the level of the superoxide radicals in the microenvironment could induce further production of superoxide radicals by the secondary cellular injury. Although the precise role of superoxide radicals in the pathogenesis of MCMV pneumonitis is still unknown, such a process seems to be involved in the formation of pulmonary lesions in MCMV-infected mice.",

Up to now, we have been unsuccessful in identifying the cells or the sites producing superoxide radicals. However, it is known that metabolically activated inflammatory cells release a considerable amount of the 22 T. Ikeda etal. radicals into the suspending m e d i u m [4] and the level of XO activity increases in activated leukocytes and macrophages [33] . Besides, capillary endothelial cells, which are a c o m m o n target of C M V infection, are shown to contain xanthine dehydrogenase in high concentrations [15] . These cells could be cogent candidates for superoxide-producing cells. Further studies will be required to clarify this point.",

Intranasal infection of i m m u n o c o m p e t e n t mice with M C M V resulted in transient and self-limited p u l m o n a r y lesions which consisted of peribronchiolar foci with mononuclear cell infiltration into the interstitium of alveolar septae. In the MCMV-infected CP 1 mice, the focal lesions in the tung were markedly augmented in their number and size although there was no significant enhancement of the virus growth. A single dose of CP administration caused transient splenic atrophy and subsequent splenic hypertrophy, and the increase in the number of focal lesions coincided with the period of splenic hypertrophy. These observations were similar to those made by Shanley et al. with BALB/c mice [27]. Although CP is k n o w n to suppress humoral and cellular immunity t-29, 34], the drug can also induce the augmentation of natural killer (NK) cell activity, cytotoxic T cell activity and delayed hypersensitivity reactions under certain conditions [11, 24, 26]. M C M V infection itself increases N K cell activity in the early period of infection and augments cytotoxic T cell",
