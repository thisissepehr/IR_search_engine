The rate of conversion during oxidation from cyst(e)ine into cystic acid and from methionine into methionine sulphone was determined.

PROfusion TM technology has routinely selected peptide and protein binders with affinity constants in the nanomolar to picomolar range. The starting library size of randomized peptide or protein PROfusion TM constructs is typically 10 13 . Linear and constrained loop peptide libraries, for ligand generation, enzyme: substrate interaction, peptidomimetic design, and epitope mapping have been successfully used. Randomized constrained loops have also been incorporated in a betasandwich scaffold, resulting in the successful selection of binders against targets of therapeutic interest. Antigenic properties of three biological active de novo proteins were investigated by peptide scanning approach, using noncleavable Multipin technology. A de novo protein albebetin (PID CAA47376) was engineered to attain a pre-designed 3D structure and later modified by grafting short peptide fragments from human \u03b1 2 interferon (AAG59605), and insulin molecules (AAG59606). Such protein constructs carrying important biological activities may be used in future as potential protein pharmaceuticals. Despite artificial proteins are investigated for more than 10 years, immunological properties of these substances are not known. In our experiments we applied an innovative approach of raising antibodies in yolks of egg-laying hens. Three continuous antigenic determinants with different immunogenic potentials have been revealed in two proteins with partially overlapping sequences. It was shown that the octapeptide interferon fragment is the immunodominant site in albeferon and albeferon-insulin molecules. On the contrary, the hexapeptides, corresponding to the insulin fragment displayed low immunogenic activity. Thus we recognise that the fragments attached to the de novo frame could essentially govern immunological properties of resulting construct.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "T.

The identification of genes encoding unique tumor associated antigens (TAAs) has facilitated the development of novel immunotherapeutic strategies in cancer patients. Clinical investigations have focused on targeting these cancer antigens for the generation of anti-tumor T-cell responses. TAA epitopes come from differentiation antigens, from embryonal reexpressed or overexpressed proteins, from mutated proteins and from viral proteins in viraly associated tumors. We have recently developed a novel screening system for identification of immunogenic and antigenic CTL peptide epitopes using D b-/-X 2M -/double knockout mice, transgenic for a single-chain HLA-A2-2M molecule (HHD mice). Specific CTL were derived by immunization of HHD mice with tumor peptide extracts loaded on antigen presenting cells and with HHD transfected human tumor cell lines CTL induced against peptides from various tumors recognized tumor peptides more effectively than peptides extracted from normal tissues and also reacted with a serie of peptides derived from overexpressed candidate proteins, identified by differential display methods (SAGE, Microarrays) Comparison of CTL derived from HHD mice to CTL induced from patient's PBMC showed overlapping recognition of many candidate peptides. Using these HHD mouse derived CTL we identified novel peptide sequences from Prostate, bladder, breast and colon carcinomas, antigens PAP and STEAP, from Breast Carcinoma antigens MUC1 and BA46-1. Analysis of tumor differentially expressed genes by the SAGE method in colon, followed by screening for HLA-A2 binding peptides resulted in 500 candidate peptides for immunogenicity screening. We have identified 22 antigenic peptides of which 7 peptides were found to be immunogenic in HHD mice. Interestingly 3 of these peptides are derived from the same protein.

We have now extended these studies to the protein composition of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and urine, and have identified several proteins specific to these fluids, including major urinary protein, uromodulin, and prostaglandin D synthase. These baseline data provide a useful comparison to the biological fluids of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats, an inbred strain, which develops cerebrovascular abnormalities following high blood pressure. Our studies have detected signs of an inflammatory condition several weeks prior to stroke. We have confirmed the sharp rise in proteinuria preceding stoke onset, and have identified the excreted proteins. Following stroke we observe a massive increase in CSF protein concentration as serum proteins, even those of large molecular size, cross an impaired blood-brain barrier. As a first step to discover useful disease markers from the urinary proteome, we have developed a unique and systematic approach for detection of low molecular weight urinary proteins by using high resolution two-dimensional (2D) electrophoresis and mass spectrometric methods. Unlike previous studies on urinary proteins, and most importantly as observed in present study, our results show that a large number of low molecular weight protein spots can be visualized in the 2D electrophoresis pattern. It was observed that protein concentration and fractionation methods were critical for our ability to detect many proteins in the gel pattern. Therefore, several approaches were carefully considered to concentrate and fractionate proteins in urine samples. Initially, urine specimens from normal individuals were concentrated by using centrifugation and ultrafiltration methods. The concentrated samples of urine proteins were then fractionated by size exclusion and immunoaffinity chromatography. The size exclusion method was used to generate two fractions of proteins based on their native molecular weights. Further, this method allowed us to enrich concentrations of less abundant proteins for each fraction. The immunoaffinity method was used to specifically remove well-known abundant urinary proteins (such as albumin) from the above mentioned two fractions. That the 2D pattern includes many native low molecular weight proteins was confirmed by analyzing both protein fractions from size exclusion chromatography. A detailed mass spectrometric analysis of the protein spots is carried out to identify the proteins observed in 2D pattern. Since urine is an ultrafiltrate of plasma, many factors in urine are present in proportion to their rate of synthesis in the body. These factors include many low molecular weight proteins that remain undiscovered due to their low abundance.

HCMV has the largest genome among the herpes-viruses (240 kbp): AD169 strain genome was completely sequenced, containing about 200 open reading frames encoding polypeptides, most of which are not characterized.

This latter category includes the virus surface antigenic proteins responsible for the main immune response during HCMV infections. Although the sequencing of HCMV genome has been completed, very little is known about the actual nature of the viral proteins. The most appropriate approach to characterize HCMV phenotype is to study its protein expression as it is carried out within the host cell. For this purpose, we analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) the protein phenotipic repertoire of human fibroblasts and compared it with that of the same cell type following infection with HCMV strain AD169. The phenotypic 2D map of human fibroblasts dramatically changes following infection with HCMV. A relevant amount of newly appeared spots is attributable to HCMV proteins, mainly of the structural category, since we analyzed host cells at the 7-9th day of infection, when the late, gamma genes are supposed to be the only to be activated.

We studied the concomitant expressional patterns of molecular chaperones in seven brain regions of adults with AD using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and matrixassociated laser desorption ionization mass spectroscopy (MALDI-MS). We unambiguously identified and quantified nine different chaperone proteins. Six chaperone proteins, heat shock protein 60 (HSP 60), HSP 70 RY, heat shock cognate (HSC) 71, alpha crystallin B chain, glucose regulated protein (GRP) 75 and GRP 94 showed aberrant expressional patterns depending on brain region. HSP 70.1, GRP 78 and T-complex 1 (TCP-1) epsilon subunit did not show any significant expressional change. These findings are compatible with neuropathological and biochemical abnormalities in AD brain and this report presents the first approach to quantify nine different chaperones simultaneously at the protein level in individual AD brain regions providing evidence for the relevance of aberrant chaperone expression to AD neuropathology. The mainstream approach to protein separation, visualisation and identification has been to use two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry for the identification of the separated proteins. However this approach is limited with the level of protein that may be loaded onto the 2D gel and the nature of the proteins that may be incorporated onto the first dimension (IpG strip).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Proteomics of human cytomegalovirus"}, {"text": "An alternative approach for the qualitative analysis of complex protein mixtures is the use of tryptic digestion followed by electrospray LC-MS/MS. This approach is dependent on a high degree of chromatographic separation prior to the mass spectrometer, such that ideally individual peptides are eluted into the source. If this is the case then the dynamic range of protein identification can be increased and low copy number proteins can be identified. Often, however there is a large degree of redundant sequence information acquired, as in theory one peptide MS/MS spectrum is sufficient to identify a protein from a sequence databank.

Thus, we are able to automatically steer the Q-Tof, during acquisition, to select and switch to the MS/MS mode only on those peaks that meet the modified selection criteria. Experiments can be designed in which peaks that belong to a protein already identified during acquisition can be avoided. This exclusion list is based upon m/z, charge state and a user definable mass tolerance. The mass measurement of the data from the Q-Tof mass spectrometer is typically better than 10 ppm and as a consequence of this a tight mass tolerance can be selected, thus making the exclude list extremely specific.

MARS removes albumin-bound toxins using a specific membrane with a dialysate solution containing albumin.

The Fischer's Index did not show any significant variation, whereas the plasma levels of Meth were well correlated with the levels of liposoluble antioxidants (Vitamin E and CoQ10). In fact, in the patients receiving just branched chain amino-acids, the plasma levels of both Meth and antioxidants progressively decreased.

The autoimmune nature of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) has introduced cytokine genes as logical candidates for the loci determining susceptibility to the disease and/or influencing disease progression. Interleukin (IL)-1alpha and 1beta are major proinflammatory cytokines that have been related with several chronic inflammatory diseases such as MS. The IL 1-receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) is a protein structurally related to IL-1beta that effectively inhibits the proinflammatory effects of IL-1. A polymorphism in the 5\u0408-flanking regulatory region at \u03ea889 of the IL-1alpha gene, which may cause an overexpression of IL-1alpha and a variable number tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism in the IL-1RA gene have been also associated with several inflammatory diseases.

In subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) oxidized low density lipoproteins (LDL) are supposed to serve as mediators for joint damage, further exacerbating the inflammatory process. To better understand mechanisms of LDL oxidation in RA a specific marker of oxidative modification of apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 proline and arginine residues, 5hydroxy-2-aminovaleric acid (HAVA), had been measured in plasma and synovial fluid LDL subfractions (LDL 1 , Svedberg units (S f ) 7-12 and LDL 2 , S f 0-7) by GC-MS. Paired knee synovial fluid and plasma samples were collected from 10 subjects with RA. Additionally, plasma samples were collected from 10 healthy controls. The LDL 1 HAVA content in plasma was not different between the groups (RA, 0.004 \u03ee 0.001 vs controls, 0.004 \u03ee 0.001 mol/mol apoB-100, P \u03ed 0.748).

Results suggest that proline and arginine residues of apoB-100 are highly reactive toward oxygen radicals in both plasma and synovial fluid in RA. Furthermore, susceptibility of apoB-100 to oxidative modification increases along the lipoprotein metabolic cascade. Particularly small dense LDL 2 were prone to direct oxidation of apoB-100. Correlation between HAVA content in plasma and synovial fluid LDL 1 and LDL 2 in RA may allow the use of HAVA as a clinical marker of antioxidant barrier impairment in RA. Vascular collagen accumulation contributes to development of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (PH).

We now treated rats with established PH with a new polymer containing an increased \"payload\" of cHyp. cHyp was conjugated to a low Mw poly(ethylene glycol)-Lysine carrier {poly (PEG1000)-Lys-cHyp} to increase the % by wt of the analogue. Rats were exposed to 10% O 2 for 7 da to induce PH. On da 0, 7 and 14 after 7 da of hypoxia, animals were injected iv with cHyp polymer in liposomes (Hc) or bioinactive trans-Hyp polymer in liposomes (Ht). Air controls received tHyp polymer in liposomes (At). At 0 and 21 da, we measured mean right ventricular pressure (RVP) and hydroxyproline (Hyp) content in main pulmonary arteries. On da 0, RVP (mmHg) was 9 \u03ee 1 and Hyp (\u00b5g/vessel) was 88 \u03ee 6 in At. RVP and Hyp increased to 17 \u03ee 1* and 139 \u03ee 4*, respectively, in hypoxic animals (n \u03ed 4; *P \u03fd 0.05 vs. At). On da 21, RVPs were at 10 \u03ee 1, Ht 24 \u03ee 1*, Hc 15 \u03ee 1* \u2020; Hyps were at 91 \u03ee 9, Ht 176 \u03ee 15*, Hc 122 \u03ee 1* \u2020 (n \u03ed 4; *P \u03fd 0.05 vs. At; \u2020P \u03fd 0.05 vs. Ht). From da 0 to 21, RVP did not increase and Hyp decreased in the Hc group vs. Ht.

In mammals, attachment of lipoic acid to these proteins requires two enzymes. Lipoate-activating enzyme (LAE) catalyzes the activation of lipoate to lipoyl-nucleoside monophosphate. Then, lipoyltransferase transfers the lipoyl moiety to the specific lysine residue of the proteins. We purified LAE from bovine liver mitochondria. LAE activated lipoate with GTP at a 1000-fold higher rate than with ATP. The reaction absolutely required lipoate and MgGTP, and the reaction product was lipoyl-GMP. LAE activated both R-and Senantiomers of lipoate to the respective lipoyl-GMP although preference for R-lipoate was observed. Lipoyltransferase equally transferred both R-and S-lipoyl moiety from respective activated lipoate to apoH-protein.

Mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene may cause phenylketonuria or hyperphenylalaninemia. Alternatively, disorders in BH 4metabolism also result in an increase in phenylalanine concentrations but simultaneously affect other BH 4 -dependent enzymes, consequently, causing a severe neurological disorder. Recently, several patients with a phenylalanine-hydroxylase deficiency but with normal BH 4 -metabolism were reported who showed a significant decrease in blood phenylalanine concentrations upon treatment with BH 4 . Indeed, two such patients in our hospital were also sensitive to daily oral doses of 5-10 mg BH 4 /kg. The subsequent molecular genetic analysis revealed that patient 1 was homozygous for the widespread mutation Y414C and patient 2 was compound heterozygous for the mutations A104D and K320N. It is striking, that all mutations are located distant from the known BH 4 -binding site and thus, should not be associated with BH 4 -sensitivity. Additionally, further patients who share the same genotype are not sensitive to BH 4 . Therefore, it must be concluded that factors independent of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene, like e.g. individual chaperone proteins, influence the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme and thereby, enhance enzymatic activity in the presence of elevated concentrations of BH 4 .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "N.

On the other hand, there have been some reports which showed that nitrogen balance of ruminants was not improved by supplementation of histidine to rumen microbial protein together with methionine, lysine and threonine which had been known to improve. Based on these facts, we have a hypothesis that histidine may not be an essential amino acid for ruminants. In the present paper, we will report about the abilities of cattle liver and kidney to synthesize histidine from histidinol comparing with those of swine liver and kidney. The ability was demonstrated by examining the activities of histidinol dehydrogenase (crude enzyme) by means of direct measurement of an increase in histidine and decrease in histidinol. The amount of histidine produced from histidinol by the enzyme seemed sufficient for meeting the histidine requirement of cattle.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Fig. 1.

In conclusion, VLDL overproduction is supposed to be completely responsible for higher triglyceride (TG) levels found in patients with T2D, IGT, and FCHL. VLDL 1 overproduction seems to be regulated by TG and FFA substrate and appears to be an indicator of decreased insulin sensitivity.

To clarify the source of branched volatile acids, specific amino acids, alanine, leucine, iso-leucine and valine were used in this study. These amino acids were first mixed with salt and added to fish. The fish mixtures were then aerobically and anaerobically incubated for one and a half months. Results showed that addition of valine significantly increased the production of iso-butyric and iso-hexanoic acids and leucine increased that of iso-valeric in the aerobically fermented fish mixtures. A similar tendency was observed in the anaerobically fermented fish mixture except that an increase in the amount of iso-hexanoic acid was observed in the leucine added mixture, which was not observed in the aerobically fermented one. It seemed that specific branched volatile fatty acids were derived from certain amino acids. Glutathione (GSH) is an important component of the cellular defense mechanisms that protect cells from oxidative injury. In the retina, the glial (M\u00fcller) cells have been shown to synthesize and transport GSH, and thus are likely to be involved in regulating GSH levels. In the present study, we have characterized GSH transport system in a M\u00fcller cell line using 35 S-GSH uptake. The results showed that GSH was taken up in a Na \u03e9 -and concentration-dependent manner with a K m of 0.31 mM. Moreover, Cellular GSH had no effect on the rate of GSH uptake. In related studies, we found that oxidative stress induced the expression of \u03b3-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS) subunits, and that GCS mRNA levels were correlated with the degree of GSH depletion. Because organic anion transporters (oatps) have been implicated in glutathione cotransport, we examined expression of oatp members using RT-PCR. We found that the M\u00fcller cell line expressed transcripts for oatp1, oatp2 and oatp3. These studies indicate that the M\u00fcller cell plays important role in GSH homeostasis in the retina.

It is well known that DNA is fragile to reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) damage. Evidences that DNA fragmentation and apoptosis occur in cardiomyopathies, in the failing heart and in cultured cells under hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) stress, demonstrated that oxygen free radicals also play a critical role in heart failure. As a consequence, myocardial cell survival depends on response to oxidative stress. Experimental data obtained in vitro suggested that polyamines, by acting as ROIs scavengers, play a role in prevention of endonucleasemediated DNA fragmentation and inhibition of alkylating agents-mediated damage, potentially exerting a protective role against ROIs damage. Thus we studied polyamine metabolism and superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression in an in vivo model of heart oxidative stress, such as rats subjected to HBO. Four experimental groups were used: 1) controls; 2) rats subjected to HBO for 15 min once and immediately sacrificed; 3) rats treated as group 2 but for 3 consecutive days and immediately sacrificed; 4) rats treated as group 3 but sacrificed 24 h later (recovery). Northern blot analyses showed that ODC mRNA accumulation increased immediately (paralleled by activity) in groups 2-4, while SSAT mRNA decreased remarkably, thus leading to higher polyamine concentration in ROIs-stressed hearts. Contrariwise, SOD mRNA level decreased rapidly in groups 2-4. This suggests that HBO-induced compensatory mechanism in rat heart is based on specific and rapid boosting of polyamine concentration, caused by coordinate induction of biosynthesis and inhibition of catabolism, and not of enzymes known to metabolise ROIs such as SOD.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The effect of acetylcysteine on blood glucose in healthy and diabetic persons J.

In this rat model, the severity of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia is strongly correlated with an upregulated expression of the prodynorphin gene in striatal neurons. Using antisense technology and gel-shift assay analyses, we have addressed the role of transcription factors which may mediate this response. We have found that the cAMP response-element binding protein (CREB) is essential in maintaining a basal expression of prodynorphin mRNA in the intact striatum, but it is not required for L-DOPA to induce the prodynorphin gene in dopamine-denervated striatal neurons. We have thus addressed the role of Fos-and Jun family tran-scription factors, and found very high levels of FosB-and JunDlike proteins in the striata of dyskinetic animals. These proteins could bind to both AP1 and CRE sites in the prodynorphin promoter. Moreover, intrastriatal fosB knockdown could inhibit both the upregulation of prodynorphin gene expression and the development of dyskinesias under chronic L-DOPA treatment.

Upon physiological conditions, glutamate release from primary afferents in the spinal cord activates largely AMPA receptors. As those are ubiquitously involved in fast transmission in the CNS, AMPA antagonists have a broad side-effect profile. Prolonged activation of nociceptors by tissue damage, inflammation or nerve injury evokes a long-lasting release of glutamate and neuropeptides, activating NMDA receptors in the spinal cord. This mechanism appears to play a key role in pain chronification. The NMDA receptor is, therefore, an important target for chronic pain treatment. Both animal and human studies confirm the efficacy of NMDA antagonists in chronic pain, however, clinically available compounds are weak or have unacceptable side-effects. Glycine B antagonists and compounds selectively blocking NR2B-containing receptors appear to be safer, the reasons for this remain unclear. Central side-effects could potentially be avoided by using NMDA antagonists with restricted central access. Peripheral NMDA receptors (as well as some other subtypes of GluRs) could be activated by glutamate released from the site of injury, thus contributing to peripheral hyperexcitability. Some other subtypes of GluRs can also contribute to peripheral sensitisation. Of ionotropic GluRs, kainate receptors appear important in inflammatory and neuropathic pain. They can be activated by high intensity stimulation of nociceptive afferents, and may act as autoreceptors controlling release of glutamate. Group I metabotropic GluRs are also present on primary afferents and on second order neurones in the spinal cord, and may play a similar role. Antagonists of these subtypes of GluRs are active in some models of chronic pain. Specific upregulation of group II metabotropic GluRs in some pain-relevant structures could reflect a possible adaptive role of these inhibitory receptors under chronic pain conditions; their selective agonists also have a potential for the treatment of chronic pain. We have performed a series of studies of the distribution and function of mGluR subtypes in the basal ganglia that suggest that members of this receptor family could serve as targets for novel therapeutic agents that would be effective in treatment of PD. For instance, two group II mGluRs (mGluR4 and mGluR7) are localized on presynaptic terminals of striatal neurons in the globus pallidus where they could reduce GABA release. Furthermore, activation of group I mGluRs results in a depolarization and increased cell firing of neurons in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and projection neurons of the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr). Interestingly, this effect is mediated by mGluR1 in SNpr projection neurons and mGluR5 in STN neurons. Finally, activation of group II mGluRs results in inhibition of glutamate release from STN terminals in the SNpr. Furthermore, selective agonists of group II mGluRs inhibit haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats, suggesting an antiparkinsonian effect of these compounds. The rich distribution and diverse physiological roles of mGluRs in basal ganglia raises the possibility that these receptors may provide targets for novel therapeutic agents that could be used for treatment of PD and related disorders.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "B.

We used electrophysiology to monitor and evaluate the damage caused by transient hypoxia to the nervous tissue. A few minutes after oxygen deprivation brain tissue suddenly depolarizes. This event, which is termed \u00ecanoxic depolarization\u00ee is accompanied by dramatic metabolic changes: transmembrane ionic gradients disappear (Na \u03e9 enters, K \u03e9 exits the neurons), neurons swell, there is intra-and extra-cellular acidosis. This event is caused by functional inactivation of (Na \u03e9 / K \u03e9 )ATPase caused by decreased ATP content, as it is suggested by the fact that it is mimicked by ouabain treatment. One of us has contributed to show that if this event is not promptly reversed by reoxygenation it causes irreversible damage, mainly by determining a massive entry of Ca 2\u03e9 into neurons. Pretreatment of tissue with creatine (1 mM or more) both increases neuronal energy store by increasing neuronal phosphocreatine and protects brain tissue from irreversible damage. In vivo increase in phosphocreatine has been shown using lower (0.5 mM) creatine concentration, injected directly into the lateral ventricle. A different type of hypoxia-induced damage is observed when hypoxia is of shorter duration. In this case upon reoxygenation one does not observe disappearance of evoked potentials but their increase. This phenomenon, originally described as \u00ecpost-hypoxic hyperexcitability\u00ee has been later called \u00ecanoxic long-term potentiation (LTP)\u00ee.

Data will be presented which supports and extends this hypothesis. Repeated cocaine injections were given for one week and three weeks after the last drug injection a number of molecular, neurochemical and behavioral neuroadaptations were measured. It was found that in the nucleus accumbens there is a increase in the expression of genes encoding mGluR2/3 and GluR1, and a decrease in the expression of mGluR5 and its accompanying scaffolding proteins Homer1bc. This was accompanied by an increase in the capacity of mGluR2/3 receptors to regulate presynaptic glutamate release and a blunting in the effects of stimulating mGluR1/5 receptors. In addition, there is reduced activity in the cystine/glutamate exchanger 3 wks after repeated cocaine. As a result of these changes there is a decrease in the basal release of glutamate, and a relative increase in the releasibility of glutamate upon stimulation. By using the reinstatement model of drug seeking behavior, it was shown that glutamate transmission in the projection from the prelimbic cortex to the core of the nucleus accumbens was particularly affected by the cocaine-induced changes in gene expression. Taken together, these findings support the use of glutamate autoreceptor agonists as possible therapeutic adjuvants in treating the cravings associated with addiction. Dopamine (DA), a catechol that autoxidizes to an oquinone, is implicated as an endogenous pro-toxin, However, the following studies suggest that DA has dual neurodegenerative and neuroprotective roles. In rats treated as neonates with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA; 134 :g icv), there was a 99% reduction in striatal tissue DA content in adulthood, and a 3 to 5fold increase in spontaneous hydroxyl radical (HO*) formation (indirect salicylate trapping method: dihydroxybenzoic acid analysis). Additionally, systemic L-DOPA (60 Mg/kg i.p.) suppressed HO* formation. However, when glutamate (50 mM) was added to an in vivo microdialysate, HO* formation was increased substantially more in the microdialysate from DAinnervated striatum. These findings indicate that DA innervation is inherently neuroprotective, but in the presence of a high level of an excitatory amino acid, DA innervation predisposes to formation of reactive oxygen species.

N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors can mediate excitotoxic or neuroprotective responses. One of the molecular mechanisms responsible for NMDA neuroprotection involves the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which in turn binds to and activates its cognate receptor TrkB. BDNF levels in the neuronal culture medium increased 2-fold when cells were preincubated for three hours with NMDA. At three hours, the increase in BDNF protein levels in the medium was accompanied by a concomitant increase in BDNF mRNA. Thus, NMDA elicited two temporally distinct responses: an early release of BDNF protein followed by a later transcriptional activation of DBNF mRNA and protein release. These results suggest that NMDA activates the TrkB receptor via a BDNF autocrine loop resulting in neuronal survival. In addition, extracellular regulated kinases (Erk 1/2) were rapidly activated, which peaked within six hours of NMDA treatment. Erk 1/2 activation is completely blocked by MK-801 and partially blocked by K252a, suggesting the NMDA and TrkB receptors act in a coordinated fashion to activate Erk 1/2. As an extension of this work, we discovered a single nucleotide polymorphism in the human NR1 gene that, when transfected into HEK cells, alters the electrophysiological properties of the NMDA receptor complex. Possible consequences of this NMDA receptor variant in signaling will be discussed.

These could involve the interactions of tyrosine and TyrO \u2022 with reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), via radical mechanisms and chain processes in the presence of O 2 and endogenous brain antioxidants. Concentrations of TyrO \u2022 , ROS and RNS can increase dramatically under conditions of generalized stress: oxidative, nitrative or reductive. This in turn can directly damage (by lipid peroxidation) or indirectly damage (by protein oxidation and/or nitration) cellular substructures which ultimately can lead to apoptotic neuronal cell death or autoschizis. Enzymatically (classical peroxidase mechanisms) or non-enzymatically formed TyrO \u2022 can react with NO \u2022 and this reversible and intrinsic \"combination\" acts to \"buffer' TyrO \u2022 concentrations. The reaction of TyrO \u2022 with superoxide (O 2 \u2022\u03ea ) is a scavenging reaction which proceeds rather by addition, not by electron transfer; and major resultant products are tyrosine hydroperoxides (TyrOOH). However, the decay of TyrO \u2022 can be also terminated by self-termination (dimerization) resulting in dityrosine (DT) formation. TyrO \u2022 can catalyze LDL oxidation, although the precise mechanisms of this reaction in vivo remain unknown. Nitration of tyrosine to 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) requires a one-electron oxidation as a primary step, with formation of TyrO \u2022 , followed by addition of the nitrogen dioxide radical (NO \u2022 2 ). The promoting effect of carbon dioxide on peroxynitrite-mediated tyrosine nitration (via radical mechanisms) (TyrO \u2022 /NO \u2022 /O 2 \u2022\u03ea /NO \u2022 2 system) is due to the selective reactivity of the putative carbonate radical anion, as compared to that of the oxidizing hydroxyl radicals ( \u2022 OH). Moreover, once formed, 3-NT may act to promote repetitive redox cycling; it may be reduced to the corresponding nitroanion radical, which is then oxidized by molecular O 2 to O 2 \u2022\u03ea and parent 3-NT. One-electron oxidation of 3-NT can result in catalytically active imminoxyl radical.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Role of VEGF in an experimental"}, {"text": "DT formation can outcompete tyrosine nitration at lowsteady state concentrations of peroxynitrite. It is unquestionable that very high fluxes of NO \u2022 and O 2 \u2022\u03ea are requisite intermediates of peroxynitrite, a tyrosine nitration agent formed via TyrO \u2022 . Evidence for the existence of generalized stress within neurons includes the presence of protein peroxides (TyrOOH), DT, and 3-NT. The nitration/denitration processes can be pathologic, but these also may play: 1) a signal transduction role; 2) a role of \"blocker\" for radical-radical reactions (scavenging of NO \u2022 , NO \u2022 2 and CO 3 \u2022\u03ea by TyrO \u2022 ); or 3) a role of delimiting factors for peroxynitrite formation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Role of VEGF in an experimental"}, {"text": "It is still unknown whether oxidation/nitration of tyrosine (as dopamine precursor or protein residue) via TyrO \u2022 formation, is a footprint of generalized stress and neuronal disorders, an important part of O 2", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Role of VEGF in an experimental"}, {"text": "\u2022\u03ea and NO \u2022 metabolism, or just a part of integral processes for maintaining neuronal homeostasis.

For instance, GH replacement therapy was found to improve the psychological capabilities in adult GH deficient (GHD) patients. Furthermore, beneficial effects of the hormone on certain functions, including memory, mental alertness, motivation and working capacity have been reported. Likewise GH treatment of GHD children has been observed to produce significant improvement in many behavioural problems seen in these individuals. Studies also indicated that GH therapy affects the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of various hormones and neurotransmitters. Further support that the CNS is a target for GH emerges from observations indicating that the hormone may cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and from studies confirming the presence of GH receptors in the brain. It was previously shown that specific binding sites for GH are present in discrete areas in the CNS of both humans and rats. In peripheral tissues GH is shown to elicit its effects through a second mediator insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). IGF-1 is well recognized as a protective agent against neural injury in the CNS. The neuroprotective effect of this peptide has a broad spectrum affecting many brain regions and acts through its antiapoptopic effect. The production of IGF-1 is upregulated in areas of brain damage and the IGF-1 system may be an important part of an endogenous neuroprotective system. In spinal cord injuries, however, the content of IGF-1 is reduced. We recently observed a neuroprotective effect of topical application of IGF-1 in animals subjected to spinal cord trauma. The observed effect may be mediated via a mechanism involving nitric oxide. In the same animal model we have very recently observed a neuroprotective effect of GH. Recent reports suggest that the level of GH is drastically reduced in patients with spinal cord injury. In victims of spinal cord injury the secretion of GH and IGF-1, as well, is known to be decreased. Therefore, exogenous substitution of GH and IGF-1 might be a promising approach in the future therapy of spinal cord injury victims. In fact, there is one report indicating that prolonged treatment with synthetic GH of spinal cord injured rats attenuates some of the neurological motor dysfunction seen in these animals 3 weeks following trauma. In our animal model we observed that topical application of rGH significantly reduced traumainduced disturbances in the fluid micro-environment. We also noted that GH was capable of attenuating the trauma-induced depression of spinal cord evoked potentials. The mechanism by which GH exerts it neuroprotective effects will be discussed. Chronically administered levodopa in Parkinson's disease (PD) treatment is ultimately associated with alterations in motor response. In 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned hemiparkinsonian rats, chronic twice-daily administration of levodopa progressively shortens duration of contralateral turning and augments the period of turning at or below 20% of peak turning rate. The pathogenesis of the response alterations involves in part sensitization of the corticostriatal glutamatergic synaptic activity. Characteristic changes involving interactions between striatal kinase and phosphatase signaling now appear to contribute to sensitization of spiny-neuron glutamatergic receptors. Glutamate-mediated striatal dysregulation, subsequently, modifies basal ganglia output system in ways that favor the appearance of Parkinsonian motor response complications. At a molecular level, transcriptional activation of striatal CREB contributes to the persistent expression of the levodopa-induced motor response alterations. Conceivably, a safer and more effective therapy for all stages of PD can be provided by drugs that target intracellularly on striatal kinases or phosphotases, or by agents that interact extracellularly on non-dopaminergic striatal receptors such as AMPA and NMDA, adenosine A2, adrenergic a2, opiod, and serotonergic 2B. The primary cause of Parkinson's disease is a loss of dopamine in the corpus striatum. It has been postulated that this effect leads to disinhibition of the striopallidal pathway and, secondarily, to a functional shift towards glutamatergic stimulation. The aim of the present study was to find out whether inhibition of glutamatergic transmission at a level of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in the striatum may alleviate parkinsonian-like symptoms in rats.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "F.

Adaptations at the Nmethyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) complex have been observed in different brain areas during chronic exposure to, and upon withdrawal from, opioids, ethanol, benzodiazepines and barbiturates. Behavioral studies employ the assessment of the effects of NMDA-R antagonists on: a) the development of dependence (NMDA-R antagonists are co-administered with the drug), b) the maintenance of dependence (NMDA-R antagonists are administered to animals with pre-established dependence, and -most relevant to the clinical situation -c) on the expression of drug dependence (assessment of the withdrawal severity in subjects with NMDA-R antagonists administered just before the expected emergence of withdrawal). The development of dependence to opioids and benzodiazepines is significantly retarded by NMDA-R antagonists. Studies from this laboratory demonstrate similar inhibition by NMDA-R antagonists of the maintenance of opioid dependence. Both in rodents and humans, the expression of opioid antagonist-precipitated as well as spontaneous (natural) withdrawal is inhibited by NMDA-R antagonists, and animal data demonstrate similar inhibition of the expression of dependence produced by ethanol, barbiturates and benzodiazepines. The involvement of the excitatory amino acid, glutamate and the inhibitiory amino acid, gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) in the pathophysiology of spinal cord trauma is not known in details. This investigation is focused on the involve-ment of glutamate and GABA in a rat model of spinal cord injury using immunohistochemistry. Spinal cord injury induced by an incision into the right dorsal horn of the T10-11 segments resulted in profound edema formation and cell damage in the adjacent T9 and T12 segments at 5 h. Pretreatment with H-290/51 (50 mg/kg, p.o.), a potent antioxidant compound, effectively reduced the edema formation and cell injury following trauma. At this time period, untreated traumatised rats exhibited a marked increase in glutamate immunoreactivity and a distinct decrease in GABA immunostaining in the T9 and T12 segments compared to the control group. The changes in glutamate and GABA immunoreactivity in traumatised rats were considerably attenuated by pretreatment with H-290/51.

However, chronic administration of of conventional antidepressants alters both mRNA levels encoding NMDA receptor subunits and radioligand binding to this family of ligand-gated ion channels in circumscribed areas of the CNS indicating that NMDA receptors may be a downstream target of these monoamine-based agents. We have recently reported (Li, et al., Neuropharmacology, in press ) that a class of AMPA receptor potentiators also exhibits antidepressant-like actions in preclinical models. In this presentation, I will describe how these two distinct, and (at a cellular level) seemingly diametric approaches employing glutamatergic mechanisms converge on intracellular targets that are also impacted by chronic treatment with biogenic amine-based agents. Kainic acid is an essential pharmacological tool for many forms of neurobiological research. Until several years ago, all commercially available kainic acid was derived from a single biological source (Digenia simplex). Commercial isolation of kainic acid in Japan ceased in 1999, creating a void in the marketplace. Recently several different companies have become providers of kainic acid, but each uses a different source of the compound (2 biological and 1 synthetic) and different isolation procedures. Our objective was to use three common assay systems to evaluate the comparative pharmacological and neurotoxicological properties of these three sources of kainic acid. Dose response curves, both alone and in the presence of receptor selective antagonists, were constructed for each kainate formulation using (a) cerebellar granule neurons in culture, (b) isolated hippocampal slice preparations, and (c) whole animal behavioural toxicity studies. Preliminary results reveal many similarities, but also distinct differences between the three formulations, especially when challenged with antagonists for different EAA receptors. Full results will be presented and discussed with respect to their implications for both extending the known kainite literature and for future studies employing kainic acid as a ligand in both mechanistic investigations and in animal models of neurodegenerative disease. Our results from in vitro studies further elucidate the role of cell-cycle related proteins in neuronal apoptosis induced by excitotoxins. Exposure of primary cerebellar neurons to toxic concentrations of glutamate was found to produce a significant, short lasting increase in the expression of p53 and cdc2.

However, after 5 years of therapy 50% of patients experience motor response complications (MRC's): the benefit from each dose becomes shorter (wearing-off), more unpredictable (on-off) and associated with involuntary movements (dyskinesias). When dyskinesias first arise, they are associated with high levodopa levels and may be prevented or minimized by lowering levodopa intake. Later on, the therapeutic window of levodopa narrows progressively and dyskinesias occur at doses equal to those needed to induce an antiparkinson effect. While the pathogenesis of motor complications remains incompletely understood, recent clinical studies implicate mechanisms downstream from the degenerating nigrostriatal dopamine system, possibly involving glutamatergic projections to the basal ganglia. In a rat model of PD, blockade of striatal glutamate receptors of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype reverses levodopa-induced motor fluctuations. Similarly, in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) lesioned primates, several NMDA-antagonists reduce levodopa-associated dyskinesias. In parkinsonian patients the NMDA-antagonists dextromethorphan, dextrorphan and amantadine improve dyskinesias as well. These findings have lead to the suggestion that hyperfunction of NMDA receptors on striatal efferent neurons, as a consequence of chronic non-physiologic dopaminergic stimulation, contributes to the pathogenesis of motor response complications. Protein misfolding and aberrant polymerization are salient features of virtually all central neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, polyglutamine diseases, tauopathies, and prion diseases. In many instances, a single amino acid change can predispose to disease by increasing the production and/or changing the biophysical properties of a specific protein. Possible pathogenic similarities among the cerebral proteopathies suggest that therapeutic agents interfering with the proteopathic cascade might be effective against a wide spectrum of diseases. However, testing compounds preclinically will require diseaserelevant animal models. Numerous transgenic mouse models of AD-like pathology have now been produced. Our studies have found that Tg2576 mice overexpressing human -amyloid precursor protein (HuAPP695K670N/M671L) produce copious deposits of diffuse and compact -amyloid as they age, and that females are more susceptible than are males (Callahan et al., Am. J. Pathol. 158, 1173 -1177 , 2001 . Recently, we also found that the overexpression of p25 protein, an activator of the kinase cdk5, results in tau hyperphosphorylation, axonopathy and severe motor deficits in transgenic mice, in the absence of neurofibrillary tangles. None of the existing transgenic models of -amyloidosis or tauopathy fully recapitulates the pathology of AD. In an attempt to more authentically model the human disease, we infused dilute AD-brain extracts into TG2576 mice at 3-months of age (i.e. 5-6 months prior to the usual onset ofamyloid deposition). We found that infusion of AD brain extracts results in: 1) Earlier and more abundant deposition of -amyloid in APP-transgenic mice (Kane et al., J. Neurosci. 20, 3606-3611); 2) evidence for the spread of pathology to other brain areas, possibly by neuronal transport mechanisms; and 3) tau hyperphosphorylation (but not neurofibrillary pathology) in axons passing through the injection site. The seeding ofamyloid by AD brain extracts suggests pathogenic similarities between -amyloidoses such as AD and other cerebral proteopathies, and could provide a new model for studying the proteopathic cascade and its neuronal consequences in neurodegenerative diseases.

Dynorphin is a neuropeptide that is present in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The peptide is actively involved in pain processing pathways. However, its involvement in spinal cord injury is not well known. Alteration in dynorphin immunoreactivity occurs following a focal trauma to the rat spinal cord. Infusion of dynorphin into the intrathecal space of the cord results in ischemia, cell damage and abnormal motor function. Antibodies to dynorphin when injected into the intrathecal space of the spinal cord following trauma improves motor recovery and reduces edema and cell changes. However, influence of dynorphin on trauma induced alteration in spinal cord bioelectrical activity is still not known. Spinal cord evoked potentials (SCEP) are good indicator of spinal cord conduction that are altered following trauma. Therefore, in present investigation, influence of dynorphin antibodies on trauma induced changes in SCEP was examined in our rat model. In addition, spinal cord edema formation and microvascular permeability disturbances were also investigated. Our results show that intrathecal administration of dynorphin antiserum prior to injury has a beneficial effect on trauma induced electrical activity, microvascular permeability disturbances, and edema formation. These observations indicate that dynorphin is somehow involved in the altered bioelectrical activity of the spinal cord and participates in the pathophysiological processes leading to cell injury. Fatty-acid binding proteins (FABPs) are involved in the intracellular binding, targeting and transport of long-chain fatty acids (FAs) to modulate cell growth and/or differentiation. FABP form a family of proteins displaying tissue-specific expression. The expression of brain type FABP (B-FABP) is spatially and temporally correlated with neuronal differentiation during brain development. Heart type FABP (H-FABP) is widely distributed and present in skeletal muscles, kidney, lung, brain and endothelial cells. It is neuron-specific in postnatal brain and participates in neurite formation and synapse maturation. Epidermal type FABP (E-FABP) is expressed at high levels during neurogenesis, neuronal migration, and terminal differentiation. Although all three FABPs could be involved in normal brain function in prenatal and postnatal life, a neurobiological role of FABPs in neurodegenerative diseases has not been reported yet. These made us evaluate the protein levels of FABPs in brains from patients with Down syndrome (DS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and fetal cerebral cortex with DS using two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis with subsequent matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectroscopy (MALDI-MS) identification and specific software for quantification of proteins. In fetal brain, B-FABP and E-FABP levels were comparable between control and DS. In adult brain, B-FABP was significantly increased in occipital cortex of DS, and H-FABP was significantly decreased in DS (frontal, occipital, parietal cortices) and AD (frontal, temporal, occipital and parietal cortices). We conclude that aberrant expression of FABPs, especially H-FABP in neurodegenerative diseases could be involved in impaired neurite outgrowth and synapse maturation. In our previous paper, it was shown that GABA-A receptor antagonist picrotoxin suppressed ETOH (ethanol) selfadministration. Recently, several authors indicated that systemic injection of dopamine or serotonine agonists reduced ethanol drinking in rats. Therefore, in the present study we investigated the effects of THIP (4,5,6,7-tetrahydroizokasazolo, 5,4-c pyridin-3-ol) GABA-A receptor agonist in naive and long-term ethanol-experienced rats on ETOH selfadministration and on cardiovascular system. Adult 13-17week-old male, normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were used. Naive rats were examined according to Smith method. Long-term ethanolexperienced rats were studied according to Boyle method. THIP was injected in naive rats at a dose of 8 and 16 mg/kg i.p. Metabotropic glutamate receptors are coupled to phospholipase C stimulation and adenylyl cyclase inhibition through G-proteins. C6 glioma cells, that endogenously express the phospholipase C coupled metabotropic glutamate receptor type, were treated with different specific agonists of these receptors and the effect of these treatments on different components of metabotropic glutamate receptor pathway was studied by radioligand binding, phospholipase C activity and RT-PCR assays. Agonists treatment caused a decrease in L-[ 3 H]Glutamate binding to intact cells and membranes in a time dependent manner being maximum at 3-6 hours and recovered at 24-36 hours. This decrease was associated with a significant increase in the mRNA level coding mGluRs. No changes on G q/11 mRNA level were detected in any case. However, a significant decrease in L-glutamate stimulated phospholipase C activity was detected after agonist treatments in both membranes and intact cells. This decrease was not associated to significant variations in mRNA level coding phospholipase C 1 isoform. All these results suggest that agonist exposure causes a desensitisation of glial metabotropic glutamate receptor decreasing not only receptors number but its functionality. In this study the interaction between these two nuclei were investigated by means of microinjection and microdialysis techniques in Sprague-Dawley rats. Steroetaxic surgery was performed by placing intracerebral parenchymal microinjection cannula into the right DMH and microdialysis probe into the left PVN. Iliac artery was also cannulated to monitor the pulsatile blood pressure and heart rate by means of pressure transducer connected to a polygraph Microinjection of 50 pmol NMDA into the DMH was performed and microdialysis perfusates were collected simultaneously from the PVN in conscious rat model. \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and L-glutamic acid levels were analyzed by an isocratic HPLC (High Pressure Liquid Chromatography) method with the aid of a fluorescent detector. Microinjection of 50 pmol NMDA into DMH produced significant increases in mean arterial pressure and heart rate. NMDA microinjection into the DMH produced significant increase in L-glutamic acid release in the PVN, but no significant change in GABA release was observed.

In an effort to identify candidate neuroexcitatory compounds, 17 different uremic retention solutes, including several amino acids and amino acid derivatives, were applied to mouse spinal cord neurons in primary dissociated cell cultures. Using the tight-seal whole-cell technique, a few of the candidate toxins were shown to evoke whole-cell currents in cells clamped at \u03ea60 mV. In a first survey, each of the solutes was briefly applied in a concentration of 5 mM. Significant inward whole-cell currents were evoked by guanidinosuccinate, spermine, and 3-indoxyl sulfate, whereas phenol evoked an outward current. Further experiments indicated that guanidinosuccinate-evoked whole-cell currents were due to activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors in concentrations similar to those found in uremic patients. High (mM) concentrations of spermine activated voltage-gated calcium channels, whereas low (\u00b5M) concentrations were found to potentiate guanidinosuccinate-evoked currents through its action on the NMDA receptor-associated polyamine binding site. Whole-cell currents evoked by 3indoxyl sulfate or phenol seemed to be due to complex interaction with several different ion channels. We conclude that guanidinosuccinate-evoked NMDA receptor activation, possi-bly potentiated by the neuroexcitatory effects of polyamines and other putative uremic neurotoxins, could be an important mechanism underlying the increased neuroexcitability in uremic brain. Glutamine (Gln) is one of the key metabolites in the CNS (energy metabolite, precursor of neurotransmitter amino acids, end product of ammonia detoxication, osmolyte), and as such is a routine supplement of CNS cell culture media. C6 glioma cells relatively easily adapt to culturing in a Gln-deprived medium. The present study investigated the effects of Gln deprivation on the characteristics of the different systems that mediate Gln cell membrane transport in the cells. In contrast to a variety of CNS and non-CNS cells, the absence of Gln did not derepress the methyl-amino-isobutyric acid (MeAiB)-sensitive (\"system Adependent\") uptake. System ASC became relatively more-, and system N less active than in cells grown in the presence of Gln, but the ion -and substrate specificity of the uptake remained unaltered. System ASC in C6 cells grown in a Glnsupplemented medium shows two features distinct from most other cell types: a) strong pH sensitivity and b) partial tolerance of lithium substitution, pointing to domination of system ASCT2 -an ASC variant strongly expressed in cultured astrocytes. Cells grown in Gln-deprived medium lost lithium tolerance, but not pH-dependence of the uptake, their properties thus resembling system GlnT (SAT1), a neuron-specific variant of system A. By contrast, transport of threonine, a standard ASC system substrate, was not affected by Gln deprivation and showed neither pH dependence nor lithium tolerance, which is typical of an ASC in all the non-CNS tissues.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "R.

The classical the hypothalamic-neurohypophysial system (HNS) is comprised of neurons originating within the supraoptic nucleus (SON) which project to the neurohypophysis to release the nonapeptides oxytocin (OXT) and vasopressin into the blood after appropriate stimulation. Previous experiments have shown that a single social defeat experience triggers the release of OXT from somata and dendrites into the extracellular fluid of the SON, but not from axon terminals in the neurohypophysis. To further investigate the regulatory mechanisms underlying this dissociated release, we exposed male Wistar rats to a 30-min social defeat experience and monitored the release of the inhibitory amino acids gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) and taurine into the SON using microdialysis. Social defeat caused a significant increase of the intra-SON pre-stress basal release). To reveal the physiological significance of the intrahypothalamically released GABAbicuculline, a specific GABA A -receptor antagonist -was administered into the SON by retrodialysis. This treatment increased significantly the release of OXT both within the SON (200%; p \u03fd 0.05 vs. pre-stress basal release) and -as measured via chronically implanted jugular venous catheters -into blood under basal and stress conditions (up to 200%; p \u03fd 0.01 vs. prestress basal release). However, bicuculline did not affect plasma vasopressin. These data demonstrate that GABA is released within the SON during social defeat to act as an inhibitor of both, central and peripheral OXT secretion during emotional stress. The mechanism described here contributes to the regulatory capacity of the HNS to ensure the appropriate involvement of OXT in the stress response of the animal (supported by DFG, EN 366-21). Down syndrome (DS) is the most common human chromosomal abnormality caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 and characterized clinically by somatic anomalies, mental retardation and precocious dementia. The phenotype of DS is thought to result from overexpression of a gene or genes located on the triplicated chromosome or chromosome region. Reports that challenge this notion, however, have been published. To add to this body of evidence, the expression ofamyloid precursor protein (APP), ETS-2 and collagen \u03b11 (VI) chain precursor, encoded on chromosome 21, was investigated in fetal brain by western blot and two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). Western blot detected APP and ETS-2 that migrated at \u03f375 and 50 kDa, respectively. Subsequent densitometric analysis of APP and ETS-2 immunoreactivity did not produce any significant change between controls and DS. Since the metabolic fate of APP determines the propensity of amyloid production, the expression of the secreted forms of APP (sAPP) had been examined. Neither the expression of sAPP\u03b1 nor sAPP showed any detectable changes among the two groups. Collagen \u03b11 (VI) chain precursor, a protein resolved as a single spot on 2D gel was identified by matrix associated laser desorption ionization mass spectroscopy. Quantitative analysis of this spot using the 2D Image Master software revealed a significant decrease in fetal DS (P \u03fd 0.01) compared to controls. Linear regression analysis did not show any correlation between protein levels and age. The current data suggest that overexpression per se can not fully explain the DS phenotype. Apoptosis is the mechanism by which cells are programmed to die under a wide range of physiological and developmental stimuli. Accumulating evidence indicates that enhanced apoptosis (programmed cell death) in Down syndrome (DS) may play a role in mental retardation and precocious neurodegeneration of the Alzheimer-type. In this regard, alteration of several apoptosis related proteins have been reported in adult DS brain. Fetal DS neurons exhibited increased reactive oxygen species leading to early apoptosis, however, expression of apoptosis related proteins in fetal DS, has never been considered. To address this issue, we investigated the expression of proteins involved in apoptosis including Fas (CD95, APO-1), caspase-3, Bcl-2 and annexins in the cerebral cortex of control and DS fetal brain by western blot and two dimensional electrophoresis. Here, we report that no detectable changes were obtained in fetal DS brain in the expression of Fas, caspase-3, Bcl-2 and Annexins (I, II, V, and VI) compared to controls. In parallel experiment, we also examined the expression of neuron specific enolase (NSE), a neuronal marker found to be decreased in adult DS brain, to see if there is any neuronal loss and no difference was observed between the two groups. Protein expression did not correlate with age. The unchanged levels of Fas, Bcl-2 and annexins together with unaltered caspase-3 expression, a predominant caspase that executes apoptosis in the developing nervous system, suggest that enhanced apoptosis may not be apparent in fetal DS brain as demonstrated for adult DS brain.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Glutamine transport in C6 glioma cells: Adaptation"}, {"text": "Introduction.

Extracellular amino acids detected by microdialysis can serve as markers for secondary ischemia. Severe ischemia is reflected by rapid increases of transmitter amino acids, due to various mechanisms including synaptic release and reversal of reuptake systems. Oligemia seems to be reflected by slow increases of structural amino acids, possibly due to a reduction in cerebral protein synthesis. Apoptosis has been implicated in the selective neuronal loss of Down syndrome (DS). Apoptosis activates a family of cysteine proteases with specificity for aspartic acid residues referred to as, caspases that play a key role in dismantling a cell committed to die. Caspases activity is regulated by a variety of proteins that possess a domain resembling the prodomains of caspases. Little is known, however, about the changes of caspases and their regulatory proteins in DS. Here, we investigated levels of nine such different proteins by western blot technique in frontal cortex and cerebellum of control and DS subjects. The protein levels of DFF45 (DNA fragmentation factor 45), and FLIP (FADD like interleukin-1 -converting enzyme inhibitory proteins) were significantly decreased whereas that of RICK (RIP-like interacting CLARP kinase) increased in both regions of DS. In contrast, cytochrome c, Apaf-1 (apoptosis protease activating factor-1), procaspase-9 and ARC (apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain) were unchanged.

In order to examine the differential roles of nitric oxide (NO) induced by either endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) or neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) after transient cerebral ischemia, we investigated the effects of the relatively selective cNOS inhibitor, l-N 5 -(1-iminoethyl)ornithine (l-NIO), the relatively selective nNOS inhibitor, 7-nitroindazole (7-NI) and the NO scavenger, 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5tetramethylimidazole-1-oxyl 3-oxide (PTIO) on hippocampal dysfunction caused by cerebral ischemia.

The fractional rates of protein synthesis in brain of ovariectomized rats treated with estradiol were significantly greater than in ovariectomized rats without estradiol treatment.

A high amount of D-serine was detected in the dialysate obtained from the medial prefrontal cortex and striatum, whereas the cerebellar dialysate contained only a trace concentration of the D-amino acid. Intra-medial prefrontal cortex perfusion of a sodium channel activator, veratrine, augmented the extracellular release of glycine and L-glutamate but a slight decrease in that of D-serine in a tetrodotoxin-sensitive manner in the prefrontal area. Moreover, selective destruction of neuronal cell bodies in the medial frontal region by means of local infusion of an excitotoxin quinolinate resulted in a marked reduction of extracellular and tissue levels of D-serine in the infused prefrontal region. These findings suggest that endogenous D-serine might be liberated into the extracellular space from non-neuronal cells or certain exceptional neuronal cells probably by a carrier-mediated process in the mammalian prefrontal cortex.

The disease is biochemically characterized by the accumulation of d-2hydroxyglutarate (D-2), which is structurally similar to lglutamate (\u03ed 2-amino-glutarate). We therefore investigated in primary neuronal cultures from chick and rat, whether D-2 induces excitotoxic neuronal damage.

Furthermore, fluorescence microscopy using dihydrorhodamine-123 revealed an increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) elicited by expo-sure to D-2. N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blockade specifically prevented excitotoxic neuronal damage as well as increased calcium influx and ROS production, suggesting that D-2 is an agonist at NMDA receptors.

There were age-related decreases in both e2 and z1 mRNA density in na\u00efve, ad lib-fed mice. Correlations were found between changes in e2 subunit mRNA and agonist binding and z1 mRNA expression and antagonist binding. Diet restriction significantly improved learning ability, slightly spared glutamate binding to NMDA sites and improved z1 mRNA expression in older mice. Significant correlations were found between agonist binding and both learning ability and e2 and e1 mRNA density. Learning ability in the old mice also correlated with the ratios of mRNA expression for e1 and e2 and/or z1 subunits.

Congenital conditions (i.e. neural tube defects: NTG) have a multifactorial aetiology. Deficiencies in the folate and transsulfuration pathways have, in recent years, been positively linked to NTD and other dysmorhogenic syndromes. Efficient one-carbon metabolism is crucial for the synthesis of DNA precursors, the remethylation of homocysteine and biomethylation of DNA. More than 80% of the one-carbon units that flow through the metabolic system in mammals and birds are derived from L-serine and glycine, the natural substrates for SHMT. The mitochondrial glycine cleavage enzyme system (GCES) can potentially compete with SHMT for tetrahydrofolate (THF) in the generation of the methylenetetrahydrofolate pool. Valproate (Depakene, Epilim), an anti-epileptic agent, appears to be strongly associated with hyperhomocysteinemia, several other induced metabolic conditions, the inhibition of the GCES and an increased incidence of NTD in epileptic women of child-bearing age.

The euphoriant and excitatory effects produced at low doses are associated with the rewarding action of ethanol and are thought to be mediated by the activation of the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system. However, ethanol monophasically stimulates mesolimbic DA release in the nucleus accumbens, even at doses that cause hypnosis and coma. In contrast, ethanol biphasically modulates mesocortical DA release in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The changes in DA release induced by ethanol are time locked with corresponding changes in extracellular glutamate levels. These biphasic effects of ethanol on PFC DA and glutamate are matched by biphasic changes in the performance in a spatial delayed alternation task -a working memory test that is sensitive to proper function of the PFC -suggesting a link between DA and glutamate transmission in the cognitive effects of ethanol. Focal application in the PFC of the competitive AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist CNQX suppresses both DA release and the improvement of working memory induced by low doses of ethanol. These results suggest that ethanol may increase DA transmission in the PFC and enhance working memory functions by increasing the release of glutamate, thereby stimulating non-NMDA glutamate receptors. The enhancing effect on working memory by low, excitatory doses of ethanol may be perceived as rewarding and could constitute an important neurobiological mechanism for excessive ethanol drinking.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Z.

Biochemical, molecular and genetic studies have considerably increased our knowledge concerning the regulation of the aspartate pathway, by which lysine is synthesized. Among the enzymes involved in lysine metabolism, aspartate kinase (AK) and dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) control the regulation of lysine biosynthesis, whereas lysine: 2-oxoglutarate reductase (LOR) and saccharopine dehydrogenase (SDH), have been shown to play a key role in the breakdown of lysine. In general, lysine overproduction can be obtained by altering the sensitivity of DHDPS to lysine, but accumulation of this amino acid in cereal seeds requires further manipulation of LOR and/or SDH. This suggestion is strongly supported by five main points: (1) Cereal mutant or transgenic plants do not exhibit any significant accumulation of lysine in seeds, but only in other tissues. (2) The enzymes of lysine degradation, LOR and SDH, are endosperm specific in cereals only. (3) The opaque-2 mutant, which exhibits higher concentration of soluble lysine and protein lysine in the seed, contains several-fold lower LOR and 2-fold lower SDH activity when compared to the wild-type maize. This reduction in activity in the opaque-2 mutant is due to a reduced protein LOR-SDH concentration by reduction of the ZLKRSDH gene transcript. Furthermore, the opaque-2 maize gene has been shown to regulate AK and LOR activity. (4) Intermediates of lysine catabolism accumulated in the seeds of soybean and canola lysine overproducing plants, suggesting the presence of reduced LOR and/or SDH activities. (5) Among cereals and although still below the recommend values by FAO, rice exhibits the higher concentration of lysine, but LOR and SDH are present in much lower activities. Also, in Phaseolus vulgaris, LOR and SDH activities were shown to be around 10fold lower then in maize endosperm. The regulation of the LOR activity is complex and involves a calcium dependent phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanism. It remains to be seen whether this latter mechanism can be controlled, so as to allow the production of more crop plants that contain elevated concentrations of lysine in the seed.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Plant Amino Acids"}, {"text": "The genetic progress for NUE can be accelerated with the use of secondary traits that possess high inheritance and correlation with productivity.

In Arabidopsis thaliana APS reductase is encoded by a family of 3 genes. In vitro studies revealed that the enzyme product derived from one of the APS reductase genes (APR1) is activated by oxidation, probably through the formation of a disulfide bond. Redox titrations show that the regulation site has a midpoint potential of \u03ea327 mV at pH 8.5 and involves a 2-electron redox reaction. Exposure of a variety of plants to ozone induces a rapid increase in APS reductase activity that correlates with the oxidation of the glutathione pool and is followed by an increase in free cysteine and total glutathione. During the response to ozone the level of immuno-detectable APS reductase enzyme does not increase. Treatment of A. thaliana seedlings with oxidized glutathione or paraquat induces APS reductase activity even when transcription or translation is blocked with inhibitors. The results suggest that a post-translational mechanism controls APS reductase. A model is proposed whereby redox regulation of APS reductase provides a rapidly responding, self-regulating mechanism to control the glutathione synthesis necessary to combat oxidative stress.

We have further shown that AreA is constitutively bound to a central cluster of four GATA sites and is directly involved in opening the chromatin structure over the promoter region and thus making additional cis-acting binding sites accesible. Here we show that the asymmetric mode of NirA-DNA interaction determined in vitro is also found in vivo. Binding of the NirA transactivator is not constitutive as in other binuclear C 6 -Zn \u03e9\u03e9 -cluster proteins but depends on nitrate induction and additionally, on the presence of a wild type areA allele. Dissecting the role of AreA further, we found that it is required for intracellular nitrate accumulation and therefore could indirectly excert its effect on NirA via inducer exclusion.

The treated ODC overproducing cells display fragmented nuclei, chromatin condensation and an oligonucleosome-size DNA \"ladder\"; consequently, their death can be described as apoptosis. The apoptotic process induced by the accumulated putrescine involves the release of cytochrome c from the mito-chondria, activation of caspases cascades demonstrated by the cleavage of caspase-2 and PARP, a substrate of caspase-3. The general inhibitor of caspases, BD-fmk, effectively inhibited PARP cleavage but failed to inhibit cell death. The intracellular Ca 2\u03e9 chelator BAPTA/AM and the antioxidant BHA inhibit PARP cleavage. However, only BAPTA/AM inhibit the induction of cell death. It seems that BHA subverted the death into caspase independent pathway. Treatment with BAPTA/AM did not interfere with the accumulation of putresine following ornithine treatment, suggesting that the accumulated putrescine induces the elevation in the concentration of intracellular Ca 2\u03e9 which then activates the apoptotic process.

Oshima and Y. Terui Department of Molecular Biology, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Science, Hachioji, Tokyo, Japan An extreme thermophile, Thermus thermophilus, produces tetrakis(3-aminopropyl)ammonium; a novel polyamine containing a quaternary ammonium nitrogen. To clarify the roles of the unique polyamine in thermophily, the effects of tetrakis(3aminopropyl)ammonium on biochemical reactions related to nucleic acids have been investigated. The unique polyamine stabilized both double and single stranded DNAs and RNAs. Tm of a double stranded DNA was raised by 8\u00b0C by the addition of 0.25 mM of tetrakis(3-aminopropyl)ammonium. At around the boiling temperature of water, depurination of DNA takes place. Other long polyamines produced by the thermophile such as caldopentaamine also stabilized DNAs and RNAs. We found that tetrakis(3-aminopropyl)ammonium prevents depurination most effectively. Tetrakis(3aminopropyl)ammonium activated the protein biosynthesis catalyzed by a cell-free extract of the thermophile at high temperature. The effects of this unique polyamine on DNA and RNA polymerases are also being investigated and the results will be presented. Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) catalyses the cross-link formation between glutamine (Q) residues and NH 2 -donor molecules present in the cells (polyamines, lysine-donor proteins). Recently, it has been correlated to neurodegenerative disorders characterised by polyglutamine (Q n ) expansion, like Huntington's disease. Studies carried out on cell extracts revealed that glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was found covalently linked to Q n domains. However, to date no structural data are available to solve the issue of which residues of GAPDH are substrates for tTG. By coupling classical protein chemistry procedures and mass spectrometric techniques we achieved this goal by using as tTG substrates the Substance P, an 11-aa peptide bearing the simplest Q n domain (Q 2 ), and polyamines of different size and shape as Q-and NH 2 -donor, respectively. In the present study we report that out of the 26 lysines present in GAPDH only three are sites of tTGasedependent cross-link formation in vitro. Moreover, to characterize the tTG catalysed cross-link between GAPDH and polyQ protein we used a synthetic Q 17 -peptide as tTG substrate in the catalysed reaction with polyamines. We found that any Q residue is a potential tTG substrate, no matter the specific position in the sequence or the steric hindrance of the specific amine under investigation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Polyamine depletion causes early embryonic lethality in"}, {"text": "CJF INSERM 95-09, Institut Contre les Cancers de l'Apareil Digestif (IRCAD), Strasbourg, France As soon as the key role of ODC in polyamine metabolism was recognised, it became the major target for selective inhibi-tion. S. Harik presented in 1973 the first potent ODC inhibitor, \u03b1-hydrazino ornithine. Although efforts continued until today, with the aim to improve ODC inactivation, 2-(difluoromethyl)ornithine (DFMO) remained the most important compound among all polyamine-directed drugs. A known anti-leukaemic drug, methylglyoxal-bis(guanylhdrazone), was recognised early on by G. Williams-Ashman and his collaborators as an inhibitor of AdoMetDC, the other highly regulated biosynthetic decarboxylase, and served as matrix for more recent developments. In the course of the years selective inhibitors for all enzymes involved in polyamine biosynthesis and degradation were synthesised. Moreover, a series of polyamineuptake inhibitors were reported. However, only some of these numerous compounds reached a stage above evaluation as growth inhibitors of cancer cells. Owing to the sophisticated homeostatic regulation of the polyamines in cells and organs by de novo synthesis, degradation, uptake and release, and due to the fact that exogenous polyamines (i.e. gut polyamines) can be utilised by the vertebrate organism, the efficacy of selective enzyme and uptake inhibitors remained modest in cancer therapy. The fact the DFMO became the most important drug for the therapy of West and Central African sleeping sickness relies on differences of vertebrate and parasite biochemistry. A novel approach, initiated by Carl Porter, involved the design and synthesis of structural analogues of spermidine and spermine, which do not share the growth-promoting effects of the natural polyamines. A very large variety of homologues, mostly of spermine, with different alkyl-substituents on the primary amino groups, have been studied systematically with regard to their ability to alter enzyme and polyamine patterns, and to inhibit cell growth. In addition polymine-like chains with interposed heteroatoms (0, S, Si etc.), and analogues with rigid aliphatic chains (due to inbuilt double and triple bonds, or of small rings) have been explored. The structural analogues either mimic regulatory functions of the natural polyamines, and thus lead to the depletion of endogenous pools of putrescine, spermidine and of spermine, or they prevent growth effects of the natural polyamines by displacing them from functionally important binding sites. The later type may be considered as polyamine antagonists. The actual drugs usually exhibit to some extent polyamine mimetic and antagonist properties. At present several polyamine analogues are in clinical trial. However, after more than 25 years of active research, a polyaminerelated anticancer drug is still not available. One may conclude from this fact that the polyamines are an inappropriate target for cancer treatment. However, it is more likely that polyamine metabolism is a difficult target, because the differences between normal and cancer cells are mainly of quantitative nature. Moreover, numerous mechanisms have developed in the course of evolution, which enable the vertebrate organism to prevent lethal polyamine losses. Nine novel chemically modified polyamine (PA) analogs were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the PA biosynthesis in rat hepatoma G-27 cell-free system as well as the growth of CaOV tumor cells. The final concentration of oxy-and aminoadenosine PA analogs or two uracils modified PA analogs were 0.1 mM in the reaction mixture. Bis(uracilyl)-analogs and 8-(2-oxyethyl)ami-no-9--D-xylofuranosyladenine supressed PA and putrescine synthesis and in the same conditions were more effective than DL-\u03b1-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) -strong specific inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). The other adenosine modified compounds could act both as activators of ODC and inhibitors both diamine and polyamine oxidase activities in regenerating liver test system. In contrast to those mentioned above two uracils modified agents as well as DFMO were able to inhibit ODC and to increase the rate of oxidative deamination of PA in the same system. Thus bis(uracilyl) PA analogs were the most active and may be useful for further investigation as substances having potential antitumor and antiproliferative properties. Several studies concerning the periodontal status in adult and adolescent patients treated with fixed Ni-Ti archwires have been performed, but until now it is not yet available any information about the influence of patient age on gingival tissue responses to Ni-Ti alloy. Recently, researches by us demonstrated that the prolonged use for over 12 months of Ni-Ti appliances may contribute to local pathological proliferative processes early detectable only through salivary polyamine concentration increase.

The effects of polyamines on the synthesis of various \u03c3 subunits of RNA polymerase were studied to determine how polyamines influence the functional specificity of transcription using Western blot analysis. Synthesis of \u03c3 28 was stimulated 4.0-fold and that of \u03c3 38 was stimulated 2.3-fold by polyamines, whereas synthesis of other \u03c3 subunits was not influenced by polyamines. Stimulation of \u03c3 28 synthesis by polyamines occurred at the level of transcription. Since our hypothesis is that polyamines regulate macromolecular synthesis mainly at the translational level, we searched for a target protein, related to the polyamine stimulation of \u03c3 28 synthesis, whose translation is altered by polyamines. Stimulation of \u03c3 28 synthesis was due to an increase in the level of cAMP, which occurred through polyamine stimulation of the synthesis of adenylate cyclase at the level of translation. Polyamines were found to increase the translation of adenylate cyclase mRNA by facilitating the UUG codon-dependent initiation. Analysis of RNA secondary structure suggests that exposure of the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence of mRNA is a prerequisite for polyamine stimulation of the UUG codon-dependent initiation. antitumor quinones are approved for clinical use and others antitumor quinones are in different stages of clinical and preclinical development.

Thus far, the specific three dimensional orientations of side chain groups ( angles; chi space) in terms of biological activity has received only modest attention. In part this may be due to the energetics of chi space compared to Ramachandran space. In order to overcome the current limitations of evaluating the importance of chi space in critical biological functions related to disease and behavior, we have designed amino acids with novel structures and unique constraints in chi space ( 1 , 2 , etc.), with special attention to their ability to mimic the chi space of native proteins and peptides.

Taurine depletion, whether by removing taurine from the diet or by using a taurine transport inhibitor, has demonstrated various pathologies in various animal models including man. The first reported pathology associated with dietary taurine depletion was in the retina of the cat. In this animal model, taurine deficiency resulted in disorganization of the tapetum (the light reflecting membrane), disruption of the outer segments, photoreceptor dysfunction, and cell loss. When allowed to proceed for a number of months the result was blindness. Subsequent studies demonstrated that taurine deficiency also had a profound effect on cardiac physiology. Echocardiograms of the left ventricle of the cat heart depleted in taurine showed a dilated cardiomyopathy reflected in an extended end-diastolic diameter and an extended end-systolic diameter. Dietary taurine supplementation resulted in the above parameters returning to normal. The cat is a difficult animal model to use for a variety of reasons and thus the rat was chosen to further probe the consequences of taurine depletion. Unfortunately, the tissue taurine levels in the rat do not respond to dietary taurine depletion, and thus other experimental means had to be designed. Guanidinoethanesulfonic acid (GES), an analogue of taurine and a taurine transport inhibitor, has been utilized for the last 20 years to deplete rat tissues of their taurine content (J. E. Shaffer and J. J. Kocsis, Methods of reducing tissue taurine levels, and R. J. Huxtable, H. E. Laird, and S. Lippincott, Rapid depletion of tissue taurine content by guanidinoethyl sulfonate. In: The Effects of Taurine on Excitable Tissues, Spectrum Publications, New York, 1981) . GES, when administered to rats in their diet in the drinking water as a 1-1.5% solution, usually produces a significant decrease in the taurine content of all tissues within one week of treatment. Within 3-5 weeks the levels of taurine reach their nadir (20-50% of control) and continued feeding of GES does not further reduce the levels of taurine. Unfortunately, GES replaces taurine and thus one must always consider the effects of GES on physiological events that occur within the tissues in question.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1793, "end": 1840, "text": "Tissues, Spectrum Publications, New York, 1981)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "J.

Successful treatment in cases of urinary tract and otorhinolaryngological infections and conjunctivitis in phase IIa clinical trials provides strong support for this concept. The endogenous sulfonated amino acid taurine has numerous functions in the central nervous system, including positive modulation of GABA A receptor function. Recently we found that mice lacking protein kinase C -epsilon (PKC\u03b5) are behaviorally and biochemically supersensitive to ethanol and other positive allosteric modulators of the GABA A receptor. In addition, these mice consume 50-75% less ethanol and wildtype controls in two separate self-administration paradigms. Microdialysis studies in PKC\u03b5-deficient mice revealed elevated extracellular levels of taurine, which may account for the supersensitivity of GABA A receptors in these mice and resulting decreases in ethanol intake. In light of the fact that the taurine derivative acamprosate (calcium acetylhornotaurinate) is moderately effective in reducing craving and relapse in detoxified alcoholics, we examined the effect of taurine-related compounds on acute ethanol consumption in a two-bottle choice paradigm in rats. Taurine (10-200 mg/kg IP) was only slightly effective in reducing ethanol intake but not preference, while the highest dose of taurine (200 mg/kg) also suppressed water intake. The taurine precursor hypotaurine (10-100 mg/kg IP) was also weakly effective in reducing ethanol intake but not preference or water intake. The most effective compound tested was homotaurine (10-100 mg/kg IP), which suppressed ethanol intake and preference by approximately 50% without altering water intake. These data indicate that endogenous taurine may regulate sensitivity to ethanol and subsequent ethanol self-administration, and that taurine-related compounds may be effective in reducing alcohol intake in humans.

Organic osmolytes, such as taurine, regulate a cell's osmotic balance without directly altering either the cell's ionic composition or the membrane potential. This property of the organic osmolyte often renders the cell resistant to damage during a pathological insult. Indeed, ischemia is associated with a massive efflux of taurine from the cell, an event that minimizes the severity of the osmotic imbalance that develops from the accumulation of lactate, inorganic phosphate and sodium. However, taurine depletion also activates specific signaling pathways that provide further protection to the cell. Among the signaling pathways activated by taurine depletion is a PI 3-kinase (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) linked pathway that catalyzes the phosphorylation and inactivation of the pro-apoptotic factor, Bad. Taurine depletion also activates protein kinase C, which in turn elevates the intracellular content of the antiapoptotic factor, Bcl-2. Increases in the extracellular osmolality by either addition of 20 mM taurine or 25 mM mannitol to the incubation medium activates similar pathways. However, PI 3kinase assumes a more important role in the mannitol treated cell than the taurine depleted cell. Moreover, p38 MAP kinase is activated by mannitol treatment but not by taurine depletion. Despite these differences, both taurine depletion and mannitol treatment protect the cell against hypoxia-induced apoptosis.

We therefore investigated the regulation of both the taurine transporter and the cysteine dioxygenase, one of the main taurine biosynthetic enzymes, in HepG2 human liver cells. The intracellular taurine content of HepG2 cells was extremely increased by culturing in a hypertonic medium. The activity of taurine transport was increased by hypertonic conditions, which was due to the increased expression of the taurine transporter gene. The expression level of the cysteine dioxygenase gene was also increased, suggesting that the expression levels of both the taurine transporter gene and the cysteine dioxygenase gene were regulated in harmony by hypertonic conditions to accumulate taurine inside cells. On the other hand, the activity of taurine transport in HepG2 cells was down-regulated on culturing the cells in taurine-rich medium, the expression level of the taurine transporter gene being also markedly decreased. However, the expression level of the cysteine dioxygenase gene was not significantly altered under taurine-rich conditions, indicating that the gene expression of the taurine transporter and that of the cysteine dioxygenase was independently regulated by extracellular concentration of taurine. The amino acid, taurine, is found in very high concentration in the heart. Although its most important putative function is osmoregulation, it also serves as a regulator of cell growth. Isolated cardiomyocytes exposed to medium containing 1 nM angiotensin II undergo hypertrophy, a process blocked by 20 mM taurine. The amino acid also inhibits angiotensin IIinduced activation of c-fos, upregulation of atrial natriuretic factor and induction of TGF-betal. Central to virtually all of these actions of angiotensin II is the translocation and activation of key protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. Therefore, we proposed that taurine inhibited the hypertrophic actions of angiotensin II by interfering with the translocation of one or more of the PKC isoforms. Indeed, taurine and angiotensin II exhibited different effects on the translocation of several PKC isoforms. While taurine promoted the translocation of PKCalpha, PKCdelta and PKCepsilon from the particulate fraction to the cytosol, the levels of the three isoforms in the particulate fraction were elevated following treatment with angiotensin II. By contrast, both taurine and angiotensin II increased the PKCzeta content of the particulate fraction and the PKCbeta2 content of the cytosol. When the isolated cardiomyocytes were incubated with medium containing both angiotensin II and taurine, the effects on PKC distribution were largely additive. These data support the notion that taurine prevents the hypertrophic effects of angiotensin II by interfering with the translocation of either PKCalpha, PKCdelta, PKCepsilon or a combination of more than one of the isoforms.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "H.

When various amounts of taurine (0.25-50 g/kg) were supplemented to HC for 2 wk, serum total cholesterol gradually and significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner, compared with the control (cholesterol free) diet group. By contrast, serum HDL-cholesterol was elevated by taurine supplementation. In the hypercholesterolemic rats fed the HC diet, the excretion of fecal bile acids and hepatic cholesterol 7\u03b1-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) activity and its mRNA level increased significantly, and the supplementation of taurine further enhances these indexes, indicating an increase in cholesterol degradation. Agarose gel electrophoresis revealed that, in hypercholesterolemic rats fed the HC diet, the serum level of the heavier VLDL increased significantly, but taurine repressed this increase and normalized this pattern. Significant correlations were observed between the time-and dose-dependent increases of CYP7A1 gene expression and the decrease of blood cholesterol concentration in rats fed the HC diet supplemented with taurine. These results suggest that the hypocholesterolemic effects of taurine observed in the hypercholesterolemic rats fed the HC diet were mainly due to the enhancement of cholesterol degradation and the excretion of bile acid. In vitro studies have shown that ammonia, which is responsible for neurological symptoms associated with hyperamonemia, causes a massive release of taurine from cultured CNS cells and brain slices. In this study, taurine (Tau) release was measured in vivo in rat striatum following direct application to the microdialysis tube of 60 mM ammonium chloride which renders the final ammonia concentration in the extracellular space of \u03f35 mM. Various in vivo stimuli evoke taurine efflux either by opening osmosensitive anion channels and/or by a mechanism secondary to Glu accumulation and its interaction with NMDA or AMPA receptors. The following compounds were coadministered with ammonia to distinguish between these mechanisms: anion/cation transport inhibitors -DIDS and furosemide, a Glu transport inhibitor-PDC, and NMDA and AMPA/KA receptor antagonists dizocilpine and DNQX. Ammonia stimulated Tau accumulation in the microdialysates to \u03f3250% of basal value. DIDS and furosemide moderately inhibited the effect of ammonia (furosemide by \u03f330%), albeit DIDS added alone induced massive accumulation of Tau with a delayed onset as compared to ammonia. Ammonia-dependent Tau accumulation was increased by \u03f350% in the presence of PDC and reduced in an equal degree (\u03f335%) by dizocilpine and DNQX.

Of interest was the parallel observation that uptake of L-arginine was enhanced in iNOS expressing cells and that this was due to de novo synthesis of carrier proteins. The precise signaling pathway that regulates the enhanced expression of these carriers has been the subject of intense studies in recent years. Current literature suggests that activation of upstream signaling molecules such as protein kinase C may be critical. In addition, downstream kinases thought to be points of convergence for various signals originating from cell surface receptors have also been implicated. Two of these downstream targets include the 42 and 44 kDa forms of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the stressactivated 38 kDa MAPK. It is worth noting however that the involvement of these different transduction pathways in the regulation of the induction of L-arginine transporters is not universal, and likely to be different from system to system. As a result there has been conflicting data on the relevance of these signaling proteins in inducing L-arginine transport in different cell. These issues will be discussed and the individual signaling pathways assessed on a cell type and species basis. Moreover, the role of downstream signaling molecules will be examined in more detail, looking in particular at the critical dependency on the p38 MAPK. This kinase currently exists in four different isoforms which are p38\u03b1, , \u03b3 and \u03b4.

Detailed electrophysiological analysis revealed an electrogenic transport mode, independent of sodium and chloride ions. Lowering the extracellular pH increased significantly substrate induced currents in cRNA injected oocytes. Out of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids the transporter recognizes only small amino acids, such as Gly, Ala, Pro and Ser.

The inward transfer of L-DOPA was largely promoted through an energy-dependent and sodium-insensitive transporter, though a minor component (\u03f315%) was found to require extraceilular sodium. L-DOPA uptake was insensitive to MeAIB, but competitively inhibited by BHC (OK LC , IC 50 \u03ed 336 \u00b5M; OK HC , IC 50 \u03ed 439 \u00b5M). L-and D-neutral amino acids and basic amino acids markedly inhibited L-DOPA accumulation. L-DOPA, Lleucine, L-arginine, BHC or L-arginine plus BHC stimulated [ 14 C]-L-DOPA efflux. The accumulation of L-DOPA was significantly higher at an acidic pH, and incubation of cells with L-DOPA (100 \u00b5M) resulted in marked intracellular acidification. Modulators of PKA, PKG, PKC and PTK failed to affect the accumulation of L-DOPA. Only the Ca 2\u03e9 / calmodulin inhibitors inhibited L-DOPA uptake. It is likely that system B 0,\u03e9 might be responsible for the sodium-dependent uptake of L-DOPA in OK cells, whereas sodium-independent uptake of L-DOPA may include systems b 0,\u03e9 and LAT2, the activation of which results in trans-stimulation of L-DOPA outward transfer. The trans-stimulation of L-DOPA inward transfer by an imposed H \u03e9 gradient suggest that OK cells are provided with an L-DOPA-H \u03e9 cotransport system. Amino acids are essential nutrients for cell growth and maintenance. The essential amino acids arginine and lysine, are mainly transported via the cationic amino acid transporter 1 protein (cat1). The regulation of translation of the cat1 mRNA during amino acid starvation was studied. An adaptive response to amino acid starvation and stress is a global decrease of protein synthesis, by phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2a. Translation of the transporter mRNA increases when eIF2a is phosphorylated, allowing synthesis of the essential for survival arginine/lysine transporter protein. The mechanism of increased translation of this mRNA involves the induction of activity of a uORF-containing internal ribosomal entry sequence (IRES). Translation of the uORF and phosphorylation of eIF2a are required for increased activity. We propose that eIF2a phosphorylation triggers translational attenuation within the uORF, converting a relatively inactive, to a high activity IRES. This study demonstrates that like yeast, mammalian cells have developed a sophisticated response to stress conditions: when expression of most genes decreases, synthesis of stress response proteins increases to support cell survival.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P.

Br\u00f6er Department for Physiology, University of T\u00fcbingen, Germany Cell volume regulatory mechanisms participate in a wide variety of cellular functions including regulation of epithelial transport, excitability, hormone and transmitter release, metabolism, migration, cell proliferation and apoptotic cell death. Besides ion transport, polyols, betaine and glycerophosphorylcholine, cells utilize amino acids including taurine to balance extracellular osmolarity and regulate their volume. Cells counteract shrinkage by uptake and swelling by release of amino acids including taurine.

The taurine release occurs with a delay of some 60 min following CD95 receptor triggering but immediately preceedes apoptic cell shrinkage and DNA fragmentation. The signaling leading to taurine release is in large part elusive but requires at some stage activation of caspases. Moreover, taurine release and apoptotic DNA fragmentation are strongly inhibited by lowering of temperature. Preloading of the cells with taurine retards CD95 induced DNA fragmentation pointing to an active role of taurine in the regulation of apoptosis. Peptide transporters of the PTR-family are integral plasma membrane proteins, that mediate the electrogenic protoncoupled transport of di-and tripeptides and peptide-like drugs across cell membranes. The physiological role of PEPT1, one member of this family in mammals, is mainly the uptake of small peptides into intestinal and renal tubular epithelial cells. In Caenorhabditis elegans a homologue to mammalian PEPT1 is encoded by the pep-2 gene, which is expressed in the intestinal cells and a subset of sensory neurons in the head of the animal.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P.

Adenosine is a potent vasodilator in many vascular beds and modulated tone via elevation of intracellular cAMP and/or release of nitric oxide (NO). We have previously reported that adenosine (ADO) stimulates L-arginine transport and NO production in human cultured umbilical vein endothelial cells (Sobrevia et al., J. Physiol. 499, 135-140, 1997) , and here further characterise the signalling cascades. RT-PCR demonstrated that fetal endothelial cell possess mRNA levels for A 2a , A 2b and A 3 -adenosine receptor subtype, whereas negligible levels were detected for the A 1 -receptor. Adenosine (10 \u00b5M, 2 min) induced increases in L-arginine transport and NO production were Ca 2\u03e9 and cAMP independent and stimulated transport was abolished in cells depolarised with 80 mM K \u03e9 . Whole-cell patch clamp experiments revealed that adenosine activated inward K \u03e9 currents, resulting in a membrane hyperpolarization and enhanced influx of the cation substrate L-arginine. Adenosine induced L-arginine transport and NO production were also abolished by inhibitors of tyrosine kinases (genistein), MEK1/2 (PD98059, U0126) but unaffected by inhibitors of PKC (calphosin C) and PI-3 kinase (LY29002). These data suggest that adenosine induces membrane hyperpolarization by activating inward K \u03e9 currents, increasing the driving force for cationic amino acid influx via system y \u03e9 .

Nowak Department of Neurobiology, Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Krak\u00f3w, PolandWe have demonstrated previously that chronic antidepressant treatment, which is required for clinical improvement, reduced the function of the glutamate/NMDA receptor complex. On the other hand antidepressant-like properties of antagonists of the NMDA receptors have been demonstrated. Zinc is an inhibitor of the NMDA receptor activity. Like other NMDA receptor antagonists, zinc exhibits antidepressant-like effects in rodent screening tests. In the present study we examined the effect of chronic treatment with imipramine on the potency of zinc to inhibit [ 3 H]MK-801 binding to NMDA receptor in the mouse and rat hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Chronic treatment with imipramine produced significant increase in the potency of zinc to inhibit [ 3 H]MK-801 binding in mice cerebral cortex but not in rats. No significant changes in the potency of zinc to inhibit [ 3 H]MK-801 binding were found after chronic imipramine treatment in hippocampus in both species. The present data are in agreement with previously reported antidepressant-induced reduction of the NMDA receptor function and suggest that effect of imipramine on the zinc and NMDA receptor interaction is species-specific.(Supported by the KBN grant No. 4P05A 105 19.)The effects of aging and diet restriction on the expression of NMDA receptor subunitsK.

The great achievements in medicine are connected with the research on the development of antinociceptive drugs.Melanocyte-inhibiting factor (MIF) is a tripeptide (Pro-Leu-Gly-NH 2 ) that was discovered in hypotalamus.The MIF-1 exerted a weak analgesic effect. The synthesis of non-protein amino acids and their incorporation into biologically active peptides might become a powerful method for the design and development of modified analogues of natural peptides. Having in mind these data we synthezied a number of new MIF-analogues, containing unnatural amino acids such as Cav, sLys, sLeu, slle and sNIe and in vivo experiments were performed to study their action on the nociception. The changes in nociceptive effects were examined in male Wistar rats by the tail-flick (TF) and hot-plate (HP), as well as, the Randall-Seitto paw-pressure tests. The peptides were applied intaperitoneal (i.p) injection at a does 1 mg/kg. The results show that the newly sinthesized analogues exert an antinociceptive effects in all tests used. Naloxone at a dose 1 mg/kg (i.p) antagonized the antinociceptive effects of MIF-analogues. The interaction between platelets and fibrinogen is known to be mediated by the intergrin GP IIb/IIIa. The Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence located on fibrinogen and other proteins of blood and extracellular matrix is the minimum requirement for cell attachment and adhesion. It has been found that peptides containing the RGD sequence can effectively inhibit the binding of fibrinogen to GP IIb/IIIa. In addition aspirin has been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of stable and unstable angina, acute myocardial infraction. Aspirin acetylates and inhibits the enzyme cyclooxygenase, the first enzyme involved in thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2 ) synthesis, an activator of platelet aggregation and adhesion.We have already reported that the combination in the same molecule of dipeptide amides, containing amino acid(s) of RGD sequence, with salicylic-residue 2-RO-C 6 H 4 -CO\u03f3, {where R\u03edH or CH 3 CO} at their N-terminal amino group have shown inhibitory activity on human platelet aggregation. Continuing this research project on salicyl-peptides we have synthesized a series of RGD analogs, incorporating salicylic acid derivatives, by conventional solution techniques and/or by solid phase. The synthesized RGD analogs were identified by IR, NMR and ES-MS spectra and tested for inhibitory activity on human platelet aggregation in vitro, by adding common aggregation reagents (collagen, ADP, thrombin) to citrated platelet rich plasma (PRP). Platelets were obtained from venous blood of healthy donors and the PRP was isolated by centrifugation at 200 g for 5 min at 37\u00b0C. The aggregation was determined using a dual channel electronic aggregometer. Malonyl dialdehyde (MDA) production was measured using thiobarbituric acid reagent. In order to confirm these results, flow cytometry with monoclonal antibodies against GpIb, GpIIb/IIIa, GpIIIa and GMP140 was used. The IC 50 values of the synthesized and tested compounds, as well as their MDA production and flow cytometry results will be discussed. Amino acids have a long tradition as building blocks, chiral auxiliaries and/or ligands in advanced organic synthesis and catalysis. At DSM an enzymatic kinetic resolution process has been developed, based on an aminopeptidase catalyzed stereoselective hydrolysis of racemic amino acid amides to form a mixture of L-amino acid and unchanged D-amino acid amide.Several small peptides currently are under investigation as possible anti-tumor agents. Neuropeptides such as substance P (SP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY), have been studied for their ability to prevent tumor growth or the proliferation of several cancer cell lines. These neuropeptides have been investigated for their effect to prostate cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and breast cancer. The synthetic SP analog [D-Arg 1 , D-Phe 5 , D-Trp 7,9 , Leu 11 ]SP (antagonist D) and the C-terminal analog [Arg 6 , D-Trp 7,9 , MePhe 8 ]SP 6-11 (antagonist G) inhibit SCLC cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, while the analogs [Glp 6 , Glu(Bu t ) 11 ]SP 6-11 and [Glp 5 , Glu(Bu t ) 11 ]SP 5-11 showed significant inhibition in the proliferation of the cancer cell lines HeLa and T47D.In the present study the C-terminal analogs of SP [Glp 6 , D-Trp 7 , Glu(Bu t ) 11 ]SP [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] (1), [Glp 6 , D-Trp 7,9 , Glu(Bu t ) 11 ]SP [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] (2), [Glp 6 , D-Trp 7,9 , MePhe 8 , Glu(Bu t ) 11 ]SP 6-11 (3), [Glp 6 , D-Trp 7 , MePhe 8 , Glu(Bu t ) 11 ]SP 6-11 (4), [Glp 6 , Trp 7 , MePhe 8 , Glu(Bu t ) 11 ]SP 6-11 (5), [Glp 6 , MePhe 7 , D-Trp 8 , Glu(Bu t ) 11 ]SP 6-11 (6), [Glp 6 , D-Trp 7 , MePhe 8 , Glu(Bu t ) 11 -OH]SP 6-11 (7), [Glp 6 , D-Trp 7 , Cys(Acm) 11 -OH]SP 6-11 (8), [Glp 6 , D-Trp 7 , MePhe 8 , Cys(Acm) 11 -OH]SP [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] (9), [Glp 6 , D-Trp 7,9 , MePhe 8 , Cys(Acm) 11 -OH]SP 6-11 (10) have been synthesized and tested for their antineoplastic properties in several cancer cell lines. They were also examined for their cytotoxicity to normal cells.The analogs 1-6 are peptide amides whereas the analogs 7-10 are peptide acids. They were performed using the stepwise synthesis either in solution, using the method of mixed anhydrides with carbonic acids or in SPPS using the Fmoc/Bu t methodology. The fragment condensation method in solution, using phosphonium reagents, such as PyBOP, was also applied. The analogs were purified (HPLC) and identified (FT-IR, ES-MS, 1 H-NMR).The antineoplastic properties of the analogs were studied using Sister Chromatide Exchange (SCE) and Proliferation Rate Index (PRI). As it is known the SCE method is an indicator of DNA damages or its repair mechanism, while the method of PRI is a sensitive marker of cytotoxicity.

The choice of method is limited by the molecular size. In addition, the differences between the ground state energy of the compounds and that of the hydrolysis reaction intermediates were compared to the experimentally found stability towards hydrolysis.With a few notable exceptions, attempts to crystallise integral membrane proteins have failed due to the difficulties in finding appropriate conditions for proteins that have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains. Thus structural information is largely limited to predictions of secondary structure from the amino acid sequence and computer modelling, neither of which can as yet give high resolution detail. Thus alternative approaches are required, and one that we have employed is to look at the substrate binding/transport characteristics of compounds and predict what features the binding site might have. The membrane transport protein that we are interested in is the proton-coupled di/tri-peptide transporter, which has a wide range of natural substrates and is known to transport therapeutically important non-peptides such as \u1b80-lactam antibiotics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.The initial question that interested us was what makes a di/ tri-peptide a substrate, but not an amino acid? While the obvious answer is the peptide bond, studies with 'space mimic' compounds (which have the space filling properties of a dipeptide but no peptide bond) gave the surprising result that the peptide bond was not essential for binding and translocation. Although these space mimics had N and C termini, studies from our laboratory and others have shown that the presence of free amino or carboxyl groups are not a prerequisite for binding or translocation either. This leaves the question of what does distinguish a PepT1 substrate from a non-substrate?Computer modelling of a large number of PepT1 substrates has allowed the development of a substrate template, whereby potential substrates can be scored according to their predicted binding affinity. From this it is clear that it is a sum of energies derived from a number of substrate-transporter interactions that determine binding affinity, including the N-and C-termini, the peptide bond components and the substrate side-chain groups. Further studies aim to refine this model through the complimentary approaches of novel substrate design and sitedirected mutagenesis of the transporter protein.Why are we interested in this? A large number of promising therapeutic compounds are found to have little or no bioavailability. Compared with most membrane transporters PepT1 has a wide range of potential substrates, and amongst its non-peptide substrates are a range of peptidomimetic therapeutic compounds. The recent finding that a peptide bond is not a prerequisite for transport opens up the possibility of designing prodrugs to be substrates for PepT1, and this has found to be an effective strategy for example with the antiviral drug valacyclovir.(We thank the Wellcome Trust for their generous support.)", "cite_spans": [{"start": 4671, "end": 4674, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4675, "end": 4678, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4679, "end": 4682, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4683, "end": 4686, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4687, "end": 4691, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4692, "end": 4696, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4741, "end": 4744, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4745, "end": 4748, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4749, "end": 4752, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4753, "end": 4756, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4757, "end": 4761, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4762, "end": 4766, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5156, "end": 5159, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5160, "end": 5163, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5164, "end": 5167, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5168, "end": 5171, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5172, "end": 5176, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5177, "end": 5181, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Melanocyte-inhibiting factor (MIF-1) and its new analogues: Effects on nociception"}, {"text": "Nuklearmedizinische Klinik und Poliklinik der Technischen Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, GermanyAim: The high amino acid metabolism of tumor cells allows tumor imaging with radiolabeled amino acids as 11 C-methionine (Met) by positron-emission-tomography (PET).

The uptake of Met and FET was determined quantitatively in tumor infiltrated and inflammatory lymph nodes as well as in the lymph nodes of untreated mice. In vivo imaging of tracer uptake in mouse lymph nodes was performed using a high resolution (2.4 mm) small animal PET (MADPET). In vitro the uptake of the amino acids Met and FET was investigated in different cells, such as SW707 human colon carcinoma cells and C6 rat glioma cells, stimulated human lymphocytes and macrophages. About 5 \u03eb 10 5 cells of each cell line were incubated in a buffered medium containing either different concentrations of unlabeled amino acids or Con A (stimulation of lymphocytes) or the transport inhibitors 2amino-norbornane-carboxylic acid (BCH, L-system), \u03b1-(methylamino)-isobutyric acid (MeAIB, A-system) or L-Serin (ASC-system). 0.37 MBq of each amino acid tracer were added and incubated. Uptake was stopped by using ice-cold PBS, cells were washed three times and uptake was analyzed.Results: In tumor infiltrated lymph nodes uptake of both tracers was higher than in control lymph nodes. Met showed an increased uptake in both lymphadenitis models, whereas FET did not accumulate significantly. Met and FET uptake in tumor infiltrated lymph nodes was also seen in MADPET images, however inflammatory lymph nodes could only be detected in Met images.The amount of tumor uptake was different in the various cell types investigated. C6 cells showed the highest uptake of all cells investigated and a slightly lower uptake was found in SW707 cells. In Con A stimulated lymphocytes, the uptake of FET was negligible, while Met uptake was significantly higher than in both tumor cell lines. Since BCH reduced the uptake of FET and Met to approximately 10%, FET seems to be also predominantly transported into tumor cells by the L-system.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Experimental studies on the uptake of radiolabelled amino acids in tumor and inflammatory cells F.

A significant limitation of FDG-PET, however, is that increased uptake is not only observed in malignant tumors but also in activated inflammatory cells. Due to the high glucose utilization of the normal brain and the lower protein synthesis in the normal gray matter the radiolabelled amino acid C-11-methionine (MET) gives higher contrast between brain tumors and normal tissue than FDG-PET. Rapid uptake of MET has been documented for several malignant tumors like gliomas, lung cancer, bladder cancer and malignant lymphomas since amino acid transport and protein synthesis are generally increased in malignancies. The application of MET-PET however has been limited by the short half life of the radioactive label C-11 (20 min) in contrast to F-18 (110 min). Amino acid analogous labeled with F-18 like F-18-fluoro-\u03b1-methyltyrosine (FMT), F-18-fluoro-ethyltyrosine (FET), F-18-fluoro-phenylanaline, F-18-fluore-proline will allow a more widespread application of amino acid PET in oncology. An other amino acid analogue I-123-iodo-\u03b1-methyltyrosine (IMT) is of clinical interest because the radionuclid I-123 allows it applicability for single-photoemission-computer-tomography (SPECT). The uptake of the amino acid analogues can only be regarded as a measure for the increased amino acid transport in the tumor cells because they are not incorporated into proteins. Clinical data show that radiolabelled amino acids that are only transported into the cells are not inferior to those that enter protein synthesis. This tracers may also help to differentiate tumor lesions from inflammatory lesions when the expression of the transport systems for amino acids in tumor cells and inflammatory cells is different.Lysinuric protein intolerance: understanding the pathophysiology of a multi-system disorder of dibasic amino acid transport M.

Sebastio 2 1 Telethon Foundation, Rome, and 2 Department of Pediatrics, Federico II University, Naples, Italy Lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI; MIM 222700) is an autosomal recessive disease, mainly found in Finland and Italy. Clinical findings of LPI include: vomiting, diarrhea, failure to thrive, hepatosplenomegaly, osteoporosis, episodes of coma, and mental retardation. A life-threatening lung involvement (alveolar proteinosis) and renal insufficiency were also reported. Metabolic derangement of LPI includes: reduced intestinal absorption of cationic amino acids (lysine, ornithine, arginine, CAA), increased renal excretion of CAA and dysfunction of the urea cycle leading to hyperammonemia and orotic aciduria. Most of the clinical findings cannot be explained by a selective deficiency of amino acid transport, as indeed observed for cystinuria (MIM 220100), a cognate disease of LPI. The molecular basis of LPI resides in an abnormal CAA carrier functioning at the level of basolateral membrane of epithelial cells in the intestine and the kidney. CAA transport is mediated by y \u03e9 L system, that is exerted by heterodimers consisting of the 4F2 heavy chain (4F2hc) and a light chain represented by either the solute carrier family 7A, member 6 (SLC7A6) or 7 (SLC7A7). After excluding the 4F2hc as the causative gene of LPI, we identified SLC7A7 as the LPI gene and characterized mutations in twenty-five patients from 21 families (16 Italian, 2 Japanese, 1 Moroccan, 1 Greek, and 1 Pakistani; 34 independent alleles) affected by LPI. Thirty-two of the 34 independent alleles (94.1%) were characterized and fourteen mutations were identified. Only five mutations (namely 1625insATCA, W242X, 1425delCTCT, IVS3 \u03e9 1GAEA, S386R) were identified in more than one independent family. Most mutations are located in the SLC7A7 coding region, except for two splicing mutations. The pathogenesis of some clinical findings of LPI, namely alveolar proteinosis and renal involvement, remains mostly unknown. We are currently investigating the role of SLC7A6 gene in LPI, which, in addition to SLC7A7, is responsible of the y \u03e9 L activity. In fact, the regulation of the y \u03e9 L system, exerted by either 4F2hc/ SLC7A76 or 4F2hc/SLC7A7, is still unknown. Hypothetically, the activation of 4F2hc/SLC7A76 in all tissues might be the \"simple\" way to a LPI gene-therapy.[Acknowledgements: M. P.

PE is associated with endothelial cell dysfunction and inadequate placental perfusion. Fetal plasma L-arginine levels are decreased in PE and there is controversy as to whether nitric oxide (NO) production is altered. We have investigated whether the kinetics of L-arginine transport via system y \u03e9 and NO production are altered in fetal umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) from PE pregnancies. Kinetics of L-arginine transport were similar in HUVEC isolated from normal, preterm and PE pregnancies, however Nethylmaleimide inhibited transport in normal but not PE HUVEC. Basal and histamine-stimulated NO production was similar in normal and preterm HUVEC, whereas PE increased basal (25 \u03ee 5 vs 5.3 \u03eb 3 pmol/10 8 cell/5 min) and histaminestimulated (70 \u03ee 12 vs 20 \u03ee 5 pmol/10 8 /5 min) NO production. Whole-cell patch clamp measurements revealed similar inward rectifying K \u03e9 currents in normal and PE HUVEC, with resting membrane potentials of \u03ea65 \u03ee 4 and \u03ea80 \u03ee 18 mV in normal and PE HUVEC, respectively. Increased eNOS activity in PE endothelial cells may serve as a compensatory mechanism to counteract the hypertension observed in PE, however, elevated NO production is apparently not associated with enhanced Larginine transport.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "R.

This phenomenon poses major problems in the treatment of patients with hospital or community-acquired infections caused by bacteria, yeast, fungi and parasitic organisms. Particularly intriguing are the so-called multidrug transporters, which have specificity of compounds with very different chemical structures and cellular targets. This lecture will focus on the molecular properties of the ATPbinding cassette multidrug transporter LmrA in the lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis. LmrA is a close homolog of the human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein, overexpression of which is one of the major causes of resistance of human cancers to chemotherapy. Surprisingly, LmrA can even substitute for Pglycoprotein in human lung fibroblast cells. Recent biochemical and pharmacological studies on LmrA suggest that the protein may operate by a two-cylinder engine mechanism to transport amphiphilic drugs from the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. This mechanism will be discussed in more detail. Bone and bone marrow are important sites of metastasis formation in breast cancer; so, we studied the level of bone sialoprotein (BSN) and fibronectin (FN), two key connective tissue antigens, in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma. Our data reveled that BSN have a statistically significant association with bone metastases in that disease. FN level was also significantly changed in metastatic breast carcinoma when compared to the non metastatic cases.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "H.

The measurements of the dielectric parameters were carried out at the frequency of 9.2 HHz, i.e. in the range of free water molecules dispersion. In contrast to dependencies for poor solvent, temperature dependencies of dielectric parameters for protein solutions are of nonmonotonous character; they have a number of peculiarities in the temperature ranges of 8-10, 22-24 and 34-36 C degrees. This fact means that at these temperatures redistribution of free and bound water in protein-water system occurs due to structural changes in protein molecules. The dependencies of hydration of HSA and fibrinogen on temperature were obtained as well.In the work the mechanism of temperature changes of spatial organisation of protein molecules was proposed. Perhaps, this mechanism is responsible for maintenance of thermal stability of the functionally active conformation of native proteins. As peculiarities on temperature dependencies of dielectric parameters of solutions of globular (HSA) and fibrillar (fibrinogen) proteins were in the same temperature regions, one may to assume that the mechanism of proteins thermal stabilisation in physiological temperatures interval has a general character.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Study of temperature induced structural transitions in proteins E.

Twenty isoforms of N-POMC, for both 11 and 13 kDa, were identified by means of mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing. These isoforms are assumed to be POMC1-74 or POMC1-95 with heterogeneous glycosylation.The N-POMC isoforms were tested on prolactin (PRL) gene expression and lactotroph mitosis in pituitary cell aggregate cultures. PRL mRNA content was quantified by means of real time RT-PCR. Three 11 kDa N-POMC fractions enhanced PRL mRNA levels by 33-36%, while all other isoforms were inactive. This effect was abolished by immunoneutralization with N-POMC monoclonal antibody. Only one fraction stimulated lactotroph proliferation (38.2 \u03ee 7.5%) as assessed by BrdU incorporation in PRL-immunoreactive cells. Several (but not all) 13 kDa N-POMC fractions stimulated PRL mRNA level and lactotroph mitosis. On the other hand, all 11 and 13 kDa isoforms activated the MC-3 and MC-5 receptor in cell lines in which these receptors were transfected. Thus, AtT20 cells produce various N-POMC isoforms, only a part of which display an effect on PRL mRNA expression. Even fewer isoforms affect lactotroph proliferation. Since all isoforms activate the MC-3 and MC-5 receptor, it is suggested that the effect of the few isoforms on lactotrophs is mediated by (a) different receptor(s). are widely prescribed for the treatment of mild to moderate depression and the putative antidepressant constituent is probably hyperforin. In this study the effect of hyperforin was investigated on the release of neurotransmitter amino acids.Coronal cortical slices (400 \u00b5m) were cut and perfused with gassed (95% O 2 , 5% CO 2 ) aCSF at 37\u00b0C. Two-minute samples of perfusate were collected and aspartate and glutamate were assayed by HPLC. Potassium-and veratridine-stimulated release was elicited by administering 2 pulses of K \u03e9 (60 mM) or veratridine (20 \u00b5M) 30 minutes apart.In control experiments the second K \u03e9 pulse elicited glutamate release which was 80% of the first pulse. Hyperforin (5 \u00b5M) perfused for 30 minutes prior to, and during, the second K \u03e9 pulse significantly increased glutamate release to 170% (P \u03fd 0.001, n \u03ed 6-8). Release elicited by the second veratridine pulse was 70% of the first pulse for both glutamate and aspartate. Hyperforin (5 \u00b5M) increased this release to the second pulse to 160% and 130% respectively (P \u03fd 0.001, n \u03ed 6-8). When perfused on its own for 30 minutes, hyperforin (5 \u00b5M) increased the basal release of glutamate (P \u03fd 0.001, n \u03ed 4-5).In conclusion, the increase in the release of neurotransmitter amino acids observed following hyperforin is possibly mediated through a facilitatory action on voltage-operated Ca 2\u03e9 or Na \u03e9 channels.Glucagon-like peptide-1 (7-36) amide (GLP1) is the main product of the glucagons gene expression in intestinal L cells into the cirulation in response to the ingestion of food and is the most potent stimulator of glucose-induced insulin secretion. GLP1 receptors have also been detected in discrete areas of rat brain and intracerebroventricular GLP1 has been shown to inhibit feeding in fasted rats. In this study HPLC techniques were employed to evaluate the effects of GLP1 on Serotonin (5-HT) and \u03b3 aminobutyric acid (GABA) metabolism in rat brain. GLP1 (0.5 \u00b5M) produced a significant decrease in levels of 5-HT by 20% after 15 minutes of incubation with combined hypothalamus and brain sterr. synaptosomes. Levels of 5hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA), the principal metabolite of 5-HT, and tryptophan the amino acid precursor of 5-HT, were also decreased significantly by 21% and 37% respectively. GABA and its amino acid precursor glutamic acid were both measured at the same conditions as above, but a precolumn derivatization HPLC technique was used. The increase in levels of GABA (14%) and Glu (6%) by GLP1 was not significant.The results suggest that decreased synaptosomal levels of 5-HT and 5-HIAA caused by GLP1 are due to diminished availability of typtophan by the peptide. In experimental model of iron overload we obtained the following results: the concentration of carbonyl groups tended to increase, while MDA level significantly increased after FeSO 4 treatment (1.66 \u03ee 0.25 vs control 1.51 \u03ee 0.50 \u00b5mol/mg prot.) and (2.13 \u03ee 0.5 vs control 1.3 \u03ee 0.3 nmol/mg protein p \u03fd 0.01) respectively. It was associated with significantly increased iron content (0.89 \u03ee 0.23 \u00b5g/mg prot. vs control 0.49 \u03ee 0.17 p \u03fd 0.001). It is clear that oxidative stress occurs in experimental iron overload, if sufficiently high levels of iron within hepatocytes are achieved. In group treated with FeSO 4 and spermine, iron content was significantly decreased (0.36 \u03ee 0.07 p \u03fd 0.01 compared with Fe treated only) and carbonyl group content tended to be lower in comparison to FeSO 4 treated only (1.58 \u03ee 0.24), but MDA level didn't change (2.31 \u03ee 0.72). In addition, treatment with spermine alone resulted in increase of MDA level (2.74 \u03ee 0.7 vs control p \u03fd 0.01), iron content didn't change (0.59 \u03ee 0.29), but carbonyl groups were decreased (0.99 \u03ee 0.28 vs control p \u03fd 0.05). FeSO 4 treatment increased GSH level (126.38 \u03ee 34.11 nmol/mg prot. vs control 88 \u03ee 22.77; p \u03fd 0.05) while in combination with spermine this increase was more profound (235.48 \u03ee 42.7; p \u03fd 0.001 vs control, p \u03fd 0.001 vs FeSO 4 ).

This sudden re-emergence of protein science, in fact, was predictable and should not have been surprising.Recent experience of protecting group design with respect to lysine and aspartic acid will be discussed together with aspects of chemical synthesis of small proteins of biological significance and in the context of chemical synthesis methodology making contributions to the general field of proteomics. Using a cell line permanently expressing the mouse taurine transporter (mTauT) as a fusion protein, we investigated the underlying mechanism by which the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA) inhibits taurine transport. CsA inhibited the recombinantly expressed mTauT function both in dose and time dependent manner. The inhibitory effect of CsA was reversible. Thus, washing out the CsA resulted in almost complete recovery of taurine uptake. To obtain further insight, we examined the surface abundance of the mTauT as a function of CsA treatment using a surface-labeling assay. Our results demonstrated that CsA treatment altered the surface expression of the mTauT without significantly altering its total expression level, and the reduction in the cell surface expression paralleled the decrease in taurine uptake. Upon removal of CsA, the virtual recovery in taurine uptake was due to the concomitant increase in the number of taurine transporters on the cell surface. Taken together, our results suggest that CsA induced inhibition of taurine uptake was either due to the impaired targeting of the taurine transporters to the cell surface or due to the removal of the transporters from the cell surface.
