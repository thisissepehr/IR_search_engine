Levels of relatedness, including paternity/maternity ( parentage), were assessed across all individuals using 19 polymorphic microsatellite loci, and unrelated cheetahs (n 5 89) from 7 regions were genotyped at 38 loci to document broad geographical patterns. There was limited differentiation among regions, evidence that this is a generally panmictic population. Measures of genetic variation were similar among all regions and were comparable with Eastern African cheetah populations. Parentage analyses confirmed several observations based on field studies, including 21 of 23 previously hypothesized family groups, 40 probable parent/offspring pairs, and 8 sibling groups. These results also verified the successful integration and reproduction of several cheetahs following natural dispersal or translocation. Animals within social groups (family groups, male coalitions, or sibling groups) were generally related. Within the main study area, radio-collared female cheetahs were more closely interrelated than similarly compared males, a pattern consistent with greater male dispersal.

The cheetah evolved from a common ancestor with the puma (Puma concolor) and jaguarundi (Puma yaguaroundi), presumably in North America, in the late Miocene (4.92 million years before the present) (van Valkenburgh et al. 1990; Johnson and O'Brien 1997; Johnson et al. 2006) , and predecessors of modern day cheetahs were once distributed across North America and Europe (Adams 1979) . However, by the end of the last glacial period, the cheetah had disappeared from most of its prior distribution, and the few surviving cheetahs experienced at least one severe demographic bottleneck that significantly reduced levels of molecular genetic variation as measured by several methods, including mitochondrial DNA DNA sequence variation (Menotti- Raymond and O'Brien 1993) , allozyme size variation ), variation in the major histocompatibility complex (O'Brien et al. 1985; Yuhki and O'Brien 1990) , and minisatellite variation (Gilbert et al. 1991; Menotti-Raymond and O'Brien 1993) . The bottleneck and associated loss of genetic variation have also been linked to several important life history characteristics of cheetahs, including increased fluctuating asymmetry in metric skull measurement (Wayne et al. 1986) , relatively low levels of normal spermatozoa in males , immunologically accepted reciprocal skin graphs between unrelated individuals (O'Brien et al. 1985) , dental anomalies and palatal erosion (Marker and Dickman 2004) , and an increased susceptibility to infectious disease agents (O'Brien et al. 1985; Evermann et al. 1988; Heeney et al. 1990; Brown et al. 1993; Munson 1993) . Approximate molecular dating places this bottleneck at the end of the last ice age.

In the structure analyses, individual cheetahs from Oma and Otj are either assigned to the northern cluster or the southern cluster or are assigned to both (have a mixed heritage). This pattern could result from the higher removal rates of cheetahs in the middle part of the country, leading to increased immigration into this region. Immigration of cheetahs into Out from the north is perhaps more limited as Out borders Etosha National Park where cheetah populations are less dense due to endemic anthrax and predation by a comparatively high density of lions and hyenas (Berry et al. 1996) . Immigration into Gro is probably restricted by limited habitat, as 65% of the Namibians inhabit this area and prey species have been almost completely extirpated.

For example, of the groups preclassified as sibling groups, 81% of these were composed of related animals. The 5 presumed sibling groups that had low relatedness scores were sampled at captive holding facilities with inadequate identification systems, and the initial classification of the group was probably the result of incorrect assignment of individuals into a group while in captivity. Similarly, of the 26 coalition male groups caught together on farms, only 3 groups consisted of apparently unrelated animals based on their low relatedness scores.
