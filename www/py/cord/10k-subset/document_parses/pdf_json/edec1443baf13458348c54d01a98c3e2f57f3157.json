The critical care of the liver transplant recipient has paralleled these improvements, largely thanks to input from multidisciplinary teams and institutionspecific protocols guiding management and care. This article provides an overview of the approach to critical care of the postoperative adult liver transplant recipient outlining common issues faced by the intensivist. Approaches to extubation and hemodynamic assessment are described. The provision of appropriate immunosuppression, infection prophylaxis, and nutrition is addressed. To aid prompt diagnosis and treatment, intensivists must be aware of postoperative complications of bleeding, primary nonfunction, delayed graft function, vascular thromboses, biliary complications, rejection, and organ dysfunction.",

Side effects include diabetes, hypertension, nephrotoxity, hyperkalemia, hemolytic uremic syndrome, neurotoxicity and nausea/vomiting. The potential for drug interactions must be considered given it is cytochrome P-450 metabolism. Dosage should be guided by therapeutic drug monitoring with higher initial target levels for the first 6-8 weeks post transplant [25] and subsequent lower levels in the event of no rejection. Target ranges differ between transplant centers. Corticosteroids remain a cornerstone of initial immunosuppression protocols with an additional role during acute rejection. Weaning patients where possible avoids side effects of diabetes, fluid retention, hypertension, delirium, osteoporosis, poor wound healing, and adrenal suppression. Steroids have also been implicated in hepatitis C recurrence [26] . Most centers utilize 500 mg or 1 g methylprednisone at induction with tapered lower intravenous (IV) doses postoperatively until eating. A period of oral prednisone at slowly reducing doses is then given over 3-6 months. Steroid-free immunosuppression has been shown possible [27] and may benefit patients with hepatitis C, diabetes, and hypertension.",

Graft failure requiring retransplantation after 7 days can be termed delayed PNF. Petrowski and Busuttil categorize risk factors into donor, procurement, and recipient related [44] . Donor factors include advanced donor age, liver macrosteatosis, and warm ischemia after circulatory death. Procurement factors include poor organ flush or cooling after cross clamp, inappropriate preservation, and cold ischemia [12 h. Recipient factors are poor vascular inflow, prolonged warm ischemia, retransplantation or cardiac arrest after reperfusion [44] [45] [46] .
