For example, an alteration in the Th1/Th2 balance, resulting in a Th2 dominance, is thought to contribute to enhanced pulmonary disease in respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis [4] . On the other hand, new evidence indicates that a disturbance of the balance between proinflammatory mediators and anti-inflammatory mediators may initiate or amplify the inflammatory response in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1, 5] . For example, the ratio of IL-1\u03b2 to IL-1 receptor antagonist is markedly elevated in patients with ARDS, favoring the unopposed proinflammatory activity of IL-1\u03b2.

No clinical study has examined the effect of servoflurane on the immune response in infants and young children. Experimental studies have shown that during mechanical ventilation of uninjured lungs several volatile anesthetics may augment gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines in rat alveolar macrophages [24] . However, servoflurane was not associated with a significant increase in gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines or with concentrations of TNF-\u03b1 in the lavage fluid of these rats over that with mechanical ventilation alone [24] . Kotani et al. [25] demonstrated in mechanically ventilated adult patients that intravenous propofol or volatile isoflurane produced a similar increase in gene expression of all proinflammatory cytokines on alveolar macrophages. This is remarkable since the route of administration of these anesthetics are completely different. One would have expected that by directly acting on alveolar macrophages the volatile anesthetic -isoflurane -would induce faster and probably more pronounced gene expression.
