This article reviews reports of perinatal and breast milk transmission of ZIKV and summarizes current clinical outcome data of pediatric non-congenital ZIKV infection. Recent Findings Perinatal transmission and presence of infective ZIKV particles in breast milk have been reported. Most symptomatic non-congenital ZIKV infection in infants and children is mild and self-limited, but long-term follow-up studies are lacking. Summary The mechanism and impact of perinatal and breast milk transmission is unclear. The current WHO infant feeding guidelines in areas of ZIKV transmission support breastfeeding.

While it was shown that primary human trophoblast cells of full-term placentae are resistant to infection with historic ZIKV strains (ZIKV strains from Uganda and Cambodia), a contemporary ZIKV strain from Puerto Rico was able to infect human placental macrophages and mature primary human trophoblast cells [33, 34] .

Reasons for this observation are not clear and may be related to health care seeking behavior and testing preferences. Overall, it has been estimated previously that about 80% of ZIKV infections are asymptomatic [37, 40] . However, a more recent ZIKV seroprevalence study from French Polynesia estimated the proportion of asymptomatic infections to be 53% overall and only 29% for school children aged 6-16 years [41] . Descriptions of the spectrum of clinical characteristics of ZIKV infection specific to pediatric patients are still limited. For one, published reports of recent large outbreaks (e.g., in Yap and Colombia) summarized the clinical characteristics for children and adults combined only as aggregate information, thus precluding the opportunity to assess for differences in the clinical presentation and course of illness according to age [37, 38] . Moreover, in the report from Yap, young children <3 years were even excluded from the household survey component of the study that was meant to determine the extent of the outbreak and identify risk factors [37] .

Other relevant symptoms reported included headache and myalgia reported by three patients, respectively g One of two had a coinfection with dengue h All had been admitted only because of temporary quarantine mandate in Singapore between 27 August and 5 September 2016 concurrent malaria infection, and one a concurrent DENV infection. No particular complications were noted in the context of those coinfections. However, another case was reported to have an episode of hypotension, and another case an episode of hematuria. Complete recovery was mentioned for four, while the course of a 15-year-old girl with sickle cell disease was complicated by ARDS, hemothorax, and splenic sequestration. ZIKV infection was confirmed by RT-PCR, while test results for DENV, CHIKV, YFY, and malaria were negative. She required intensive care and subsequently died. For five cases, no comment was made about outcome. The largest population-based case series comes from the USA including a total of 158 confirmed or probable travel-associated pediatric cases (<18 years) that were reported to ArboNET, CDC's national arboviral disease surveillance system, until September 9, 2016 [10\u2022\u2022] . Children living in Puerto Rico and other US territories were not included in this analysis. Most cases were reported from the state of Florida, New York, and California. The median age was 14 years, 142 (90%) were of school age (aged \u22655 years), 16 (10%) were 0-4 years old, and 5 teenagers (aged [16] [17] were pregnant. Fever and rash were the predominant symptoms and signs, two children (aged 1 and 4 years) required hospitalization, and there was no mortality nor reported neurologic complications (Table 2 ). It was noted that there were no differences among age groups in the proportion of the clinical features observed. The authors acknowledge that the inclusion of only symptomatic cases in this report may be one of several limitations. Other limitations include a bias towards testing females of childbearing age, a lack of rigorous reporting system (the only optional reporting of symptoms is to ArboNET), and the lack of systematically collected clinical follow-up data [10\u2022\u2022] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 189, "end": 193, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 194, "end": 198, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 199, "end": 203, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 418, "end": 422, "text": "[37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 423, "end": 426, "text": "40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 619, "end": 623, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1062, "end": 1066, "text": "[37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1067, "end": 1070, "text": "38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1280, "end": 1284, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1304, "end": 1308, "text": "[42\u2022", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1473, "end": 1477, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1478, "end": 1482, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1483, "end": 1487, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1488, "end": 1492, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1493, "end": 1497, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1498, "end": 1502, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2058, "end": 2062, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2063, "end": 2067, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2068, "end": 2072, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2073, "end": 2077, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 2078, "end": 2082, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2083, "end": 2087, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 4106, "end": 4112, "text": "[10\u2022\u2022]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4411, "end": 4415, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 4416, "end": 4420, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 5098, "end": 5104, "text": "[10\u2022\u2022]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1618, "end": 1626, "text": "Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 4617, "end": 4625, "text": "(Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Clinical Characteristics of ZIKV Infection in Children Acquired Postnatally"}, {"text": "The most recently published case series of ZIKV infection in children comes from Singapore [49\u2022] .
