Dual-use life science technologies are increasingly diffuse, globalized and multidisciplinary and are often based on intangible information rather than on specialized materials and equipment. This changes the definition of the problem from a material-and equipment-based threat that can be eliminated to a knowledge-based risk that must be managed. If what people know is more important than what people have, then the crucial factor becomes the choice that people will make about how they use the knowledge they have, and this changes fundamentally the kinds of measures to which policymakers must give attention (Moodie, 2012) .",

Even with access to synthetic DNA, assembling the DNA segments into a synthetic virus and converting the virus into a deliverable weapon would pose significant technical hurdles.

A DNA molecule may consists of a single strand of nucleotide bases along a sugar backbone or two mirror-image strands that pair up to form a double helix, with adenine (A) always complementary to thymine (T) and guanine (G) complementary to cytosine (C). A second type of nucleic acid called RNA differs from DNA in the structure of its sugar backbone and the fact that one of the four nucleotide bases is uracil (U), which replaces thymine as the complementary base for adenine. An infectious virus consists of a long strand of single-stranded or double-stranded DNA or RNA, encased in a protein shell.",

The first and most straightforward approach is to order the entire viral genome from a commercial gene-synthesis company by entering the DNA sequence on the company's Website. (A leading commercial supplier, Blue Heron Biotechnology in Bothell, WA, has synthesized DNA molecules up to 52 000 base pairs long.) The genomic sequence would be synthesized in a specialized facility using proprietary technology that is not available for purchase, packaged in a living bacterial cell and shipped back to the customer. The second option would be to order oligonucleotides (single-stranded DNA molecules o100 nucleotides in length) from one or more providers and then stitch them together in the correct order to create an entire viral genome. The advantage of this approach is that one can obtain more accurate DNA sequences, avoid purchasing expensive equipment and outsource the necessary technical expertise. The third option would be to synthesize oligonucleotides with a standard desktop DNA synthesizer and then assemble the short fragments into a genome. This approach would require acquiring a DNA synthesizer (purchased or custombuilt) and a relatively small set of chemicals.",

Over a period of several months, Eckard Wimmer and his co-workers at the State University of New York at Stony Brook assembled the poliovirus genome from customized oligonucleotides, which they had ordered from a commercial supplier. When placed in a cell-free extract, the viral genome then directed the synthesis of infectious virus particles. The following year, Hamilton Smith and his colleagues at the J. Craig Venter Institute in Maryland published a description of the synthesis of a bacteriophage, a virus that infects bacteria, called jX174. Although this virus contains only 5386 DNA base pairs (fewer than poliovirus), the new technique greatly improved the speed of DNA synthesis. Compared with the more than a year that it took the Wimmer group to synthesize poliovirus, Smith and his colleagues made a precise, fully functional copy of the jX174 bacteriophage in only 2 weeks (Smith et al, 2003) .",

In 2005, researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention used sequence data derived from the frozen or paraffin-fixed cells of victims to reconstruct the genome of the 'Spanish' strain of influenza virus, which was responsible for the flu pandemic of 1918-1919 that killed tens of millions of people worldwide; the rationale for resurrecting this extinct virus was to gain insights into why it was so virulent. In late 2006, scientists resurrected a 'viral fossil', a human retrovirus that had been incorporated into the human genome around 5 million years ago (Enserink, 2006) . In 2008, a bat virus related to the causative agent of human SARS was recreated in the laboratory (Skilton, 2008) . That same year, the J. Craig Venter Institute synthesized an abridged version of the genome of the bacterium Mycoplasma genitalium, consisting of 583 000 DNA base pairs (Gibson et al, 2008) . In May 2010, scientists at the Venter Institute announced the synthesis of the entire genome of the bacterium Mycoplasma mycoides, consisting of more than 1 million DNA base pairs (Gibson et al, 2010; Pennisi, 2010) .

Early US developers of biological weapons preferred veterinary diseases such as anthrax, tularemia and Venezuelan equine encephalitis, which are not contagious in humans, because they made a biological attack more controllable. The Soviet Union, in contrast, weaponized contagious diseases such as pneumonic plague and smallpox for strategic attacks against distant targets, in the belief that the resulting epidemic would not boomerang against the Soviet population.

First, the de novo synthesis of an infectious viral genome requires an accurate genetic sequence. Although DNA or RNA sequences are available for many pathogenic viruses, the quality of the sequence data varies. Genomes published in publicly available databases often contain errors, some of which may be completely disabling whereas others would attenuate the virulence of a synthetic virus.

Thus, poliovirus is relatively easy to synthesize because it has a small genome made of positivestranded RNA, whereas the smallpox virus is hard to synthesize because it has a very large genome made up of double-stranded DNA. Synthesizing the Marburg and Ebola viruses would be moderately difficult: although their genomes are relatively small, they are not directly infectious and enabling them to produce virus particles would be challenging (WMD Commission, 2008) . Despite these hurdles, the risk of misuse of DNA synthesis is expected to increase over time. One analyst has claimed that 10 years from now, it may be easier to synthesize almost any pathogenic virus than to obtain it by other means (WMD Commission, 2008, p. 15 ).",

These guidelines call for subjecting all requests for synthetic double-stranded DNA to a process of customer and sequence screening. Upon receiving a DNA synthesis order, the supplier should review the information provided by the customer to verify its accuracy and check for 'red flags' suggestive of illicit activity. If the information provided raises concerns, the supplier should ask the customer for additional information. Screening the requested DNA sequence to identify any sequences derived from or encoding Select Agents is also recommended. If the customer or the sequence raises concerns, providers are urged to clarify the intended end-use. In cases where follow-up screening does not resolve the concern, providers are encouraged to seek advice from designated government officials. The US guidance document also recommends that providers retain electronic copies of customer orders for at least 8 years, the duration of the statute of limitations for prosecution.

Like the US government guidance document, the Code of Conduct recommends an initial screen to confirm the customer's bona fides, followed by an automated screen of the sequence order using a computer program to search for similarities between gene sequences. Any hits from the automated screen are then assessed by human experts. If the hits are judged to be real and not falsepositives, follow-up screening is done to verify the legitimacy of the customer before the order is filled (IASB, 2008) . Shortly before the IASB Code of Conduct was launched, two companies that had initially been involved in the process dropped out and established their own group, the International Gene Synthesis Consortium (IGSC). This body includes five of the world's leading gene-synthesis companies and claims to represent 80 per cent of the industry (Check Hayden, 2009 ). Because of its large market share, the IGSC asserts it has the experience to develop workable screening measures and has put forward a 'Harmonized Screening Protocol' to rival the IASB Code of Conduct (Bhattacharjee, 2009) .

Yet regulatory law can benefit suppliers if it increases public confidence in the technology. This advantage is particularly relevant in the biotechnology field because private biotech companies ultimately depend on social support for the creation of new markets. Moreover, a regulatory regime that leads companies to act in a responsible manner (and to be seen as doing so) may actually be more profitable than a less restrictive regime that generates constant controversy and hostile campaigning. Indeed, Michael Porter has argued that strict environmental regulations, rather than shifting external costs onto companies and burdening them relative to competitors in countries with less stringent regulations, can result in a 'win-win' situation in which the companies' private costs are reduced along with the external costs they impose on the environment (Porter and van der Linde, 1995) . Porter concludes, 'Strict environmental regulations do not inevitably hinder competitive advantage against foreign rivals, indeed, they often enhance it'. Thus, the synthetic DNA industry could potentially benefit from a regulatory regime that carefully balances stringency with legitimacy, although this solution would require companies to accept a certain regulatory burden.",

Self-governance may provide incentives for companies to behave in a responsible way. The reward for adopting screening practices, for example, is inclusion in the 'club' of companies that are seen as reputable and 'doing the right thing', sending a positive signal to customers and investors. In this way, successful companies can help to regulate others by designating screening practices as necessary for economic success. If, however, the screening guidelines are not generally adhered to, then self-governance may discourage other companies from implementing them, especially when there are costs involved. This is a situation where the force of law can be particularly persuasive. Indeed, the gene-synthesis industry has recognized the problem of non-compliance with voluntary guidelines. A workshop report from the IASB notes, 'Ultimately, the definition of standards and the enforcement of compliance with these is a government task' (IASB, 2008, p. 14) .",

The ultimate hope is that customers will put economic pressure on those non-compliers to fall in line, or else lose all but the most disreputable business. But that is just a hope. As the recent meltdowns on Wall Street have indicated, industry self-policing can sometimes fail dramatically. When bad business practices can have grave effects for the public, regulators should be firm and proactive. (Nature Editorial, 2008) Another approach is professionalization, which lies between self-governance and statutory measures. In most jurisdictions, all professional practitioners are licensed and belong to an association established by law, which sets the standards of practice for its members in order to align them with the public good. The officers of the association are elected by the members and are expected to be advocates for the profession. This combination of a legislated mandate and collegial self-governance provides accountability for the profession as a whole and for its individual practitioners. Weir and Selgelid argue that the professionalization of synthetic biology would establish educational standards for its members and define normative standards of practice, with the aim of ensuring competence and preventing misconduct. By combining self-governance and legally-authorized governance, this approach avoids the polarization that has characterized much of the debate over the regulation of synthetic biology (Weir and Selgelid, 2009 ).",

Her primary research interests are focused on biosecurity and synthetic biology, and the range of social, ethical, political, legal, economic and geographical issues associated with these two key emerging research themes in the field of biomedicine and society. She is especially interested in the social shaping of risks and threats, and in the social organization and deployment of evidence, facts and knowledge. Her current research on the politics of bioterrorism is funded by an ESRC Mid-Career Fellowship.",
