An effective defence against crises is only possible if the organizational resilience and the capacity to handle crises become part of the hospitals' organizational culture. To become more resilient to crises, a raised awareness-especially in the area of human resource (HR)-is necessary. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the process robustness against crises through the identification and evaluation of relevant HR crises and their causations in hospitals. Methods: Qualitative and quantitative methods were combined to identify and evaluate crises in hospitals in the HR sector. A structured workshop with experts was conducted to identify HR crises and their descriptions, as well as causes and consequences for patients and hospitals. To evaluate the findings, an online survey was carried out to rate the occurrence (past, future) and dangerousness of each crisis. Results: Six HR crises were identified in this study: staff shortages, acute loss of personnel following a pandemic, damage to reputation, insufficient communication during restructuring, bullying, and misuse of drugs. The highest occurrence probability in the future was seen in staff shortages, followed by acute loss of personnel following a pandemic. Staff shortages, damage to reputation, and acute loss of personnel following a pandemic were seen as the most dangerous crises. Conclusions: The study concludes that coping with HR crises in hospitals is existential for hospitals and requires increased awareness. The six HR crises identified occurred regularly in German hospitals in the past, and their occurrence probability for the future was rated as high.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "In industrialized countries, hospitals are the backbone of the health-care system. In Germany, 18 787 168 hospital treatments were conducted in 1 996 hospitals in 2013 [1] . Like in most countries, nearly half of the hospital beds are in public ownership with a growing number of privately owned hospitals [2] . The aim of the hospitals is to heal diseases, prevent deterioration of the patients, or alleviate disease symptoms through trained staff and adequate equipment. For that reason, hospitals are a relatively hazardous working environment for staff. But the complexity of providing medical care in a high-tech environment makes hospitals more crisis-prone than less complex industries [3] . Due to the rising incidence and impact of crises, the significance of crisis research has heightened in recent years [4] . However, there is still a lack of generally agreed definitions and typologies of crises [4, 5] . A crisis is \"a state differing from the normal state which has the potential to or already has incurred damage to persons and/or technical equipment\" [6] . Transferred to hospital management, a crisis is one or numerous critical situations which could not be handled by routine measures of quality management. A hospital crisis is regarded as an event or a series of events that may occur either suddenly or which may take some time to evolve. It results in a major, urgent problem with potentially severe consequences for the hospital, and it must be addressed immediately.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 168, "end": 171, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 306, "end": 309, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 693, "end": 696, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 816, "end": 819, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 910, "end": 913, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 914, "end": 916, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1069, "end": 1072, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Although crisis management activities have increased significantly in recent years, systematic reviews indicate that the scientific evidence for safety interventions in hospitals is still limited and that the methodological quality of the studies is generally weak [3, 5, [7] [8] [9] [10] .

Afterwards, we conducted post hoc tests and used a Bonferroni correction which is a conservative procedure to handle the problem of alpha inflation.

Participants identified under-appreciation of effective communication within the hospital and addressing the wrong target group as important causes for communication problems during crises.

Thirdly, information about the occurrence (past and future) and the dangerousness of these relevant crises were collected empirically. To accomplish these goals, several methodical steps were conducted. The crises were ascertained in workshops (12 participants), and the causes were identified in semistructured interviews with experts from the field (2 participants). The empirical evaluations of the crises were conducted nationwide via an online questionnaire (74 participants). In this discussion, firstly, the qualitative and then the quantitative results will be discussed. The results regarding the causes are used to derive practical implications. Finally, the limitations and the conclusion are presented. Six different HR crises were seen as relevant for German hospitals from our experts' point of view (see Table 1 ). According to the experts, staff shortages are characterized by the fact that certain skills are not available within the HR market. Positions are vacant, but the applicants do not have the requested competencies. As a consequence, vacancies cannot be filled, service plans cannot be ensured, and patients must be sent away. This description is close to other definitions of staff shortages. For example, Buchan and Aiken [27] describe staff shortage as a gap between the reality of current availability of staff and the aspiration for some higher level of provision. The fact that staff shortages are seen as a \"crisis\" raises the question about the nature of a crisis. Staff shortage is surely an abnormal situation which can threaten the operation, safety, and reputation of a hospital (see definition above), but the sudden and unforeseeable character, which is typical for many crises, is not the case here. This is more appropriate for the second crisis. As the experts determined in the workshop, a pandemic is a special crisis for hospitals because the workload is higher than during regular operations, and at the same time, the number of employees decreases. For example, nearly half of the 2002 SARS epidemic cases in Toronto and Singapore were detected in health-care workers [11] . A pandemic, however, is only one reason for the occurrence of increased numbers of patients and affected hospital staff at the same time.

Thus, there is already a growing number of studies addressing topics related to capacity planning [38] and preparedness for bioterrorism and other infectious diseases [9, [11] [12] [13] 39] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 406, "end": 410, "text": "[36,", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 411, "end": 414, "text": "37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 515, "end": 519, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 584, "end": 587, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 588, "end": 592, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 593, "end": 597, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 598, "end": 602, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 603, "end": 606, "text": "39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "As explained above, the risk indicator is the product of the occurrence probability of the crisis in the future, multiplied with its dangerousness.

The hospital market in Germany changed a lot over the last decades: Since 1993, the number of hospitals in Germany has been decreasing continuously. At the same time, many hospitals changed from public into private sponsorship. The proportion of beds in private hospitals increased about 66% from 2003 to 2013 [40] . At the same time, the number of beds in public hospitals decreased about 17%.

Furthermore, there is a declining share of younger people facing an increasingly older population [27, 44] . Aside from the demographic imbalance, which was identified as the main reason for the crisis, there is a decline of health-care staff, especially of nurses [45] . In a large European study, which examined nurses' early occupation exits with a sample of 39 898 European nurses, reasons for the lack of staff were identified. Many nurses stated physical and mental stress and lack of staff and time to provide adequate care to patients as reasons to leave the job early [45] .

One identified cause for staff shortage-low immigration of skilled personnel-could be solved by increasing the number of apprenticeships and university placements or promoting the immigration of skilled workers [34, 47] .

Furthermore, interim staffing can be one solution to face a short-time increased demand [49] .
