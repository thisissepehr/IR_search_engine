Vaccination remains a cornerstone in the prevention of infection. However, vaccine efficacy can vary from 50 to 80% in a healthy population 1 and is significantly decreased in groups such as the immune compromised, 2 very young children and the elderly. 1 Thus, while much of the focus is on prevention, there are significant populations that remain at risk of infection. With the recent emergence of more pathogenic strains such as the 2009 and 2014 H1N1, infection can have more devastating consequences. During the 2013-2014 influenza season alone, it was reported that a very high number of young, otherwise healthy individuals required critical care in the intensive care unit, with a high percentage (72%) of these patients developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure requiring ventilator therapy. 3 The current course of treatment for these patients consists of anti-viral therapies (Oseltamvir or Zanamivir), which are most effective when given within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. This is often well outside the window in which individuals seek medical attention. Given the tremendous inflammation and injury that occurs in the lung after influenza infection, effective therapeutic regimens should be focused on reducing viral burden, while decreasing inflammation and at the same time promoting lung/epithelial repair.",

            "text": "The host response to influenza infection has been the subject of intense research to determine whether aspects of this response can be exploited therapeutically. It is important to understand that cytokines play critical roles in both regulating protective and reparative processes as well as causing injury. Interleukin-22 has great potential in reducing pulmonary injury and promoting epithelial repair. Its limited receptor distribution allows IL-22 to have a focused effect on the epithelium. Through the IL-22Ra1/IL-10Rb receptor complex, IL-22 activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in the lung epithelium, thereby augmenting barrier function, epithelial repair, and the induction of anti-microbial genes. 4 Our lab 5 and others [6] [7] [8] have shown that IL-22 is important for recovery during influenza infection, as Il22 \u2212/\u2212 mice have more severe injury. Moreover, we showed IL-22 receptor distribution in the lung and its importance in reducing lung pathology in both the airways and lung parenchyma after influenza challenge. We also found that Il22 \u2212/\u2212 mice infected with H1N1 PR/834 have enhanced structural lung pathology, defective expression of genes that control epithelial repopulation, and increased evidence of fibrosis. 5 Generally, IL-22 is not found in the naive lung and is produced by activated T cells following infection. In the case of influenza, IL-22 is produced by both natural killer (NK) and natural killer T (NKT) cells. 7, 9 Once it is produced, it can be post-translationally regulated through interactions with IL-22-binding protein (IL-22BP). This soluble receptor is a naturally occurring antagonist that has a 20-1000-fold higher affinity for IL-22 than the membranebound IL-22Ra1. [10] [11] [12] IL-22BP binds IL-22 at a site that is directly adjacent to and interferes with the binding of both its membranebound receptors, IL-22Ra1 and IL-10Rb. 11 When bound to IL-22BP, IL-22 is unable to signal through STAT3. [10] [11] [12] There are currently three isoforms that have been identified in humans. 9 Isoform 1 is retained intracellularly and does not bind IL-22. Human isoform 1 has been found to interact with components of the unfolded protein response. 13 Human isoform 2 is most closely related to the single murine isoform of IL-22BP and is induced under inflammatory conditions. Human isoform three binds IL-22 with less affinity than human isoform two and is present at high levels during homeostatic conditions. 10 In the intestine, IL-22BP is made by dendritic cells 14, 15 and is regulated by the inflammasome. 15 Neutralizing IL-22BP in the lung significantly increases survival and decreases neutrophilia in a mouse model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 16 Under naive conditions in the lung, alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages (AMs) have been identified as sources of IL-22BP, 17, 18 and neutrophils are a source during catastrophic lung injury. 18 In the current study, we demonstrate that shifting the balance of the IL-22/IL-22BP axis in favor of IL-22 promotes recovery during influenza infection by promoting tight junction formation. We demonstrate that NK and CD45 \u2212 cells and macrophages are main cellular sources of IL-22BP under naive conditions. However, following influenza infection, these cellular sources decrease production, whereas production by dendritic cells is upregulated. Using Il22ra2 \u2212/\u2212 mice we demonstrate that a pro-IL-22 environment significantly reduces pulmonary inflammation and vascular leak into the lung as well as lung pathology. We further reveal that this reduction in lung leak may be due to increases in tight junctions (CLDN4, TJP1, and TJP2), which was confirmed both in vitro and in vivo. More importantly, we demonstrate that the therapeutic nature of IL-22 as oropharyngeal administration of IL-22:Fc during infection improved the epithelial barrier and reduced inflammation.",

[5] [6] [7] To better understand the changes occurring in the inflammatory compartment, bronchoalveolar lavage 20 fluid was collected and total inflammatory cells were counted. There were no differences in the BAL of mock-infected WT and Il22ra2 \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 3a, b) with >98% of the cells being macrophages (data not shown). In conjunction with the histopathology data, Il22ra2 \u2212/\u2212 mice had decreases in inflammation. At day 5, where the weight loss curves began to diverge, there was a decrease in total inflammation (Fig. 3a) as well as a reduction in the total number of T cells (Fig. 3c) . These data corresponded with decreased cytokine levels of IL-6, IL-17, interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), and RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) (Fig. 3f) . Inflammatory changes persisted through day 10, where Il22ra2 \u2212/\u2212 mice had significant decreases in total inflammatory cells (Fig. 3b) . In comparison to day 5, both groups had decreases in total neutrophils and lymphocytes with an increase in macrophage numbers. This increase was significantly abrogated (p < 0.0001) in the Il22ra2 \u2212/\u2212 mice however (Fig. 3d) . Differences in types of macrophages were investigated as they were the most robustly altered between the WT and il22ra2 \u2212/\u2212 groups at day 10. Despite significant differences in total numbers of macrophages between the groups, the ratio of M2 (CD45 + F4/80 + MHCII + CD206 + )/M1 (CD45 + F4/80 + MHCII + CD206 \u2212 ) macrophages remained unchanged (Fig. 3e) .",

To test this Il22ra2 \u2212/\u2212 , mice were sacrificed 5 dpi, during optimal IL-22 expression. We found that Il22ra2 \u2212/\u2212 mice had significantly less injury as measured by LDH Fig. 4a) . Further, they had significantly less leak into the lung as measured by total protein in the BAL (Fig. 4b) . To confirm these data, a subset of influenza-infected mice were injected (i.v.) with Evan's blue dye 30 min prior to sacrifice. Similar to the total protein data, Il22ra2 \u2212/\u2212 mice had significantly less dye in the BAL (Fig. 4c) , demonstrating less pulmonary edema during influenza infection. Loss of barrier function from influenza infection has been attributed to reduced claudin expression in epithelial cells leading to reduced tight junction formation. 24 To understand if our observed differences in lung leak were associated with changes in tight junction proteins, we analyzed gene expression of claudins and tight junction proteins. RNA was collected from mouse bronchial brushings (5 dpi), allowing us to focus primarily on epithelial gene expression. In agreement with the pulmonary leak data, we found Il22ra2 \u2212/\u2212 mice had significantly higher expression of Tjp1,Tjp2, Cldn4, and Ocln during infection (Fig. 4d) .",

To test the impact of IL-22 administration, we used a human recombinant (r)IL-22:Fc, 25 which is capable of signaling on mouse cells (Fig. 6a) . Mice were treated with IL-22:Fc or Fc control 6 days after infection, when the expression of Il22ra2 significantly wanes (Fig. 1b) . Measurement of vascular leak into the lung revealed a significant decrease 24 hours after IL-22:Fc treatment (Fig. 6b) . To confirm these results were not due to off-target effects of the human IL-22 or the Fc, we performed experiments in mice lacking the IL-22 receptor. Il22ra1 \u2212/\u2212 mice 19, 26 were crossed with eIIa-cre +/+ (eIIa cre ) mice. This cre is expressed in the early mouse embryo and thus causes recombination and excision of Il22ra1 globally. eIIa cre \u00d7 Il22ra1 fl/fl or eIIa cre controls were infected and treated at days 6 and 8 after infection. Although not significant, IL-22R-competent mice, but not IL-22R-deficient mice, recover weight after IL-22 treatment. Moreover, results showed that IL-22:Fc treatment significantly reduced the influx of inflammatory cells in the BAL of eIIa cre mice, but not the mice lacking the IL-22 receptor (eIIacre +/+ \u00d7 Il22ra1 fl/fl ) (Fig. 6d) or in control-treated mice. These data demonstrate that IL-22 signaling through the IL-22 receptor can significantly restore lung tight junctions and reduce inflammation. 8 as expression of Il22 increase in response to influenza infection, there is a reduction of Il22ra2. This is during the same time that the IL-22Ra1 is increased on epithelial cells. 5, 28 These changes allow the lung to become a more permissive environment for IL-22 activity. This has been confirmed by microarray studies in which only 431 genes were differentially regulated after IL-22 treatment in naive mice as opposed to 1231 genes after IL-22 treatment in influenza-infected mice. 22 With the exception of rotavirus, 29 IL-22 does not alter viral load in other organ systems. 30, 31 We confirm these observations, as a pro-IL-22 signaling environment in il-22ra2 \u2212/\u2212 mice had no bearing on influenza burden. Our studies are further supported by findings in the Il22 \u2212/\u2212 mice, which also had no differences in viral burden. [5] [6] [7] Interestingly, our findings in the Il22ra2 \u2212/\u2212 mice demonstrate that pulmonary recovery is independent of the viral load of the animal.",

[5] [6] [7] The effects of IL-22 are dependent on the inflammatory milieu and it has been hypothesized that the evolutionary function of IL-22BP is to act e Comparative quantification of ZO-1 mean fluorescent intensity by group. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test. n = 5 and is representative of three experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001 as a rheostat controlling the concentration of IL-22 in the milieu and thus its function. 10 We found significantly enhanced expression of IL-6, IL-17, IFN\u03b3, and RANTES in WT mice when compared to Il22ra2 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Both IL-6 and IL-17 have negative implications in influenza infection. IL-6 is associated with more severe infection 32 and clinically worse outcomes. 33 Similarly, IL-17 is associated with exacerbated influenza associated pathology [34] [35] [36] While it is unclear if IL-22 reduces IL-17 or IL-6 directly or through a general reduction of inflammation, it is likely that the reduction of these two cytokines is associated with the improved recovery observed in the Il22ra2 \u2212/\u2212 mice. We found that IL-22 promotes tight junction formation during influenza infection, reducing fluid buildup in the lung and induces claudin-4 both in vivo and in vitro. This tight junction transmembrane protein is found on epithelium throughout the lung. 37 It functions to promote fluid clearance through paracellular chloride efflux. 38 It is induced during mechanical trauma [39] [40] [41] and induction is considered protective in lung injury in both mice and humans. [39] [40] [41] [42] During influenza, claudin-4 is the primary tight junction protein that is decreased. 24 The increased claudin-4, as well as other scaffold proteins (zo-1 and zo-2) likely account for the reduced fluid buildup seen in pro-IL-22 conditions. These data not only have implications for influenza, they are also promising for other injurious or infectious situations that induce acute lung injury.",

Furthermore, targeting this axis has also proven useful in lung bacterial infections 4, 19 and fungal infections, 46 as well as bacterial co-infections. 8, 22 The question remains though-If IL-22 is so important in resolving infection, why is it so tightly controlled and is it safe to target? The answers to this can be found at other epithelial surfaces. In the skin, overabundance of IL-22 is associated with increased inflammation and psoriasis [for a review see ref. 47 ] and reduced expression of IL-22BP only exacerbates this process. 48, 49 In the intestine, where IL-22 is constitutively expressed to protect the mucosal surface, 50 Il22ra2 \u2212/\u2212 mice develop greater number of tumors in a colitis cancer model. 15 Therefore, too much IL-22 can have negative consequences. This does not preclude the positive, potentially therapeutic data we present here. Our studies examine very acute responses to IL-22/ IL-22BP imbalance and therefore not likely to induce pathology that is seen in diseases of chronic IL-22/IL-22BP imbalance. The IL-22/IL-22BP axis has likely evolved to protect organs from the potentially inflammatory and proliferative effects of chronic IL-22 exposure. The balance between the two proteins naturally shifts during influenza infection, to allow the lung to be more pro-IL-22. While knocking out Il22ra2 has a profound benefit on recovery during influenza infection, there are currently not any known therapeutic approaches designed to do this. Administration of IL-22:Fc may prove to be more beneficial. IL-22:Fc is currently in clinical trials for intestinal graftversus-host disease (NCT02406651) and alcoholic hepatitis (NCT02655510) and may prove to be a useful therapy during influenza-induced pneumonia.",

Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test or Student's T test (e). remains a severe global health threat. Despite great efforts in advancing vaccination strategies, there is little understanding of how to treat severe influenza-induced pneumonia in cases where vaccination is ineffective. To develop treatment options for severe influenza, it is vital to understand the immune processes that occur during infection. Here we show the importance of the IL-22/IL-22BP axis in influenza infection. We show that during influenza infection there is a change in the balance of IL-22/IL-22BP with IL-22 increasing at the same time Il22ra2 expression is being reduced. We also identified multiple sources for IL-22BP in the lung with the most predominant being CD45 \u2212 cells. Next, using Il22ra2 \u2212/\u2212 mice we demonstrate that a pro-IL-22 signaling environment reduces pulmonary inflammation and vascular leak into the lung as well as lung pathology. The reduced leak into the lung is due to increases in tight junction proteins as we found significant increases in claudin-4 as well as zo-1 and zo-2 both in vivo and in vitro. More importantly, we demonstrate that the therapeutic nature of IL-22 as oropharyngeal administration of IL-22:Fc during infection improved the epithelial barrier and reduced inflammation. IL-22 activity appears to be tightly controlled in the lung, as neither transgenic overexpression 27 nor IL-22 administration 22 induce any pathology or inflammation under naive circumstances. This is likely due in part to limited expression of the IL-22 receptor 5 and constitutive production of IL-22BP. 8,10 Our data demonstrate that Il22ra2 is present during naive conditions, -/ -I I 2 2 r a 2 -/ -I I 2 2 r a 2 -/ -I I 2 2 r a 2 -/ -I I 2 2 r a 2 -/ -I I 2 2 r a 2 -/ -I I 2 2 r a 2 -/-Il22ra2 \u2212/\u2212 mice have decreased pulmonary injury and increased tight junctions during influenza infection.
