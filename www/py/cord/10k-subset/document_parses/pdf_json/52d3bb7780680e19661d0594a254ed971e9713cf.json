In naive peripheral T cells, activation of PKC via the T cell receptor is required for IL-2 secretion, IL-2 receptor upregulation, and clonal expansion of CD4 and CD8 T cells (Sakowicz-Burkiewicz et al., 2008) . Normal activation of PKC relies on the stimulation of phospholipid hydrolysis that follows a growth factor-receptor interaction. Activated PLC could hydrolyze membrane phosphatidylcholine into diacylglycerol and phosphocholine, and diacylglycerol is known to enhance the PKC activity (Way et al., 2000) . Here, we found that CsA induced the decrease of PKC in peripheral blood T lymphocyte. Compared with t10,c12-CLA isomer, c9,t11-CLA isomer significantly increased the production of PKC.
