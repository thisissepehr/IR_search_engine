            "text": "Objective: The goal was to develop a pediatric airway stent for treating tracheobronchomalacia that could be used as an alternative to positive pressure ventilation. The design goals were for the stent to allow mucus flow and to resist migration inside the airways, while also enabling easy insertion and removal. Methods: A helical stent design, together with insertion and removal tools, is presented. A mechanics model of stent compression is derived to assist in selecting stent design parameters (pitch and wire diameter) that provide the desired amount of tracheal support, while introducing the minimal amount of foreign material into the airway. Worst-case airway area reduction with stent support is investigated experimentally using a pressurized tracheal phantom matched to porcine tracheal tissue properties. The stent design is then evaluated in a porcine in vivo experiment. Results: Phantom testing validated the mechanics model of stent compression. In vivo testing demonstrated that the stent was well tolerated by the animal. Since the helical design covers only a small portion of the epithelium, mucus transport through the stented region was minimally impeded. Furthermore, the screw-like stent resisted migration, while also providing for atraumatic removal through the use of an unscrewing motion during removal. Conclusion: The proposed stent design and tools represent a promising approach to prevent airway collapse in children with tracheobronchomalacia. Significance: The proposed technology overcomes the limitations of existing airway stents and may provide an alternative to maintaining children on a ventilator.",

            "text": "T RACHEOBRONCHOMALACIA is the most common congenital defect of the central airways [1] and has been identified in up to 15% of infants and 30% of young children undergoing bronchoscopic examination for respiratory distress [2] . The condition arises due to intrinsic weakness of the wall and cartilaginous support. For these children, during dynamic expiration and coughing at low lung volume, pleural pressure exceeds intraluminal pressure resulting in airway collapse [3] , Digital Object Identifier 10.1109/TBME.2019.2910551 [4] . The standard treatment is positive pressure ventilation of 5-10 cm H 2 O [5] , which raises the intraluminal pressure sufficiently to prevent collapse during expiration [5] - [7] . During the 3-9 month treatment period, however, the child must remain connected to a ventilator and close monitoring is needed to provide regular suctioning of the endotracheal tube. Even with suctioning, the inability to clear mucus leads to an increased risk of airway infections including pneumonia and tracheitis [8] - [10] . An alternative approach to positive pressure ventilation is to employ a physical stent to prevent airway collapse. Since existing airway stents are sized for adults, some neonates have been treated with metal mesh vascular stents [11] . Similar to the experience with metal airway stents in adults, however, these stents induce the growth of granulation tissue through the mesh requiring a very invasive removal procedure and, furthermore, can erode through the airway and into adjacent structures [12] , [13] . To avoid these issues, solid silicone tubes have been developed for the adult population, but their thickness reduces the airway diameter and they have a high migration rate [14] , [15] . They also block mucociliary function ( Fig. 1(a) ) over the length of the stent resulting in mucous plugging and inspissated secretions that impede gas exchange [12] , [16] .",

Recently, surgicallyplaced external resorbable tracheal splints have been developed which show great promise for those patients with malacic airways who also require thoracic surgery [21] .

The contribution of this paper is to develop a helical stent, Fig. 1(b) , addressing these criteria as well as tools for its delivery and removal. Furthermore, we validate the design through bench and in vivo experiments. The remainder of this paper is arranged as follows. In the next section, we propose a helical stent design and derive a mechanics-based model for computing stent deformation under a given external pressure. Next, we develop a silicone trachea phantom to evaluate the effect of tissue deformation on airway area reduction and the relationship with stent pitch and wire diameter. Next, stent delivery and removal tools are described, followed by in vivo stent safety validation in a porcine model. Conclusions are presented in the final section.",

Furthermore, analogous to a screw, this geometry will resist migration while also enabling atraumatic removal in the case of endothelialization via an unscrewing motion.

The model of Section II-A was then used to solve for the practical range of pitches to be considered. To solve for the maximum pitch, we computed the pitch for the smaller wire diameter that would result in a 30% reduction in cross sectional area under 10 cm H 2 O pressure. We selected the minimum pitch as that which resulted in a difference in cross sectional area of less than 5% for the two wire diameters under the same radial pressure.

The device is comprised of a notched outer cannula and cylindrical inner cannula. The notched outer cannula functions like a spatula. Under bronchoscopic guidance, the notched cannula is extended such that the ball enters the notch. Rotation of the notched cannula causes the ball to slide onto the interior of this cannula from where it can be positioned at the innermost corner of the notch and locked in place using the inner cannula.

Since the tracheal phantom was completely unsupported, this value represents a worst-case area reduction. Consequently, these parameters would likely provide sufficient airway protection and so were selected for the in vivo test. The 18.6 mm pitch of the phantom studies corresponds to a helix angle of 25 \u2022 so this helix angle together with a wire diameter of 0.51 mm were used to design stents for the in vivo experiment. Since the tracheal diameter of the pig was not known in advance, stents were prepared in 5 diameters (10.03, 11.62, 13.21, 14.80 and 16.38 mm) and two lengths, corresponding to 2 and 3 complete coils, respectively. At the start of the procedure, a chest x-ray was taken and the inner diameter of the trachea was estimated to vary between 11.4 mm to 13.2 mm in the desired region of stent deployment. To avoid stent migration, the stent should be preloaded against the tracheal tissue and so a diameter of 13.21 mm was selected for deployment. In addition, stent length was selected to be 3 coils so that approximately half of the trachea was stented.",
