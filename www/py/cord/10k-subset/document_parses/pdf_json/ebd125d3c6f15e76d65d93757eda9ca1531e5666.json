(1) Because of the importance of public health data, in recent years, a number of public health information and surveillance systems have been developed to collect public health data, such as those for the early detection of bio-terrorism events. According to a comprehensive summary (2) of the existing public health systems based on data sources, transmission standards, and collection techniques, most of public health data are collected from emergency medical service (EMS), emergency department (ED), and hospitals (see Fig. 1 ). ED is the most popular data source and public health information from ED has been collected by most public health systems, such as the Indianapolis Network for Patient Care (INPC) (3) and the Syndromic Surveillance Information Collection (SSIC) system. (4) In addition to ED, EMS and hospitals, as well as others (e.g. physician groups and primary care units), have been adopted as major public health data sources by a few public health information systems. (1) Associated with data sources, different data transmission standards and collection techniques have been developed. Major data transmission standards include Text, eXtensible Markup Language (XML), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), Open Database Connectivity Standard (ODBC), and Health Level 7 (HL7) standard. (1) Moreover, data collection techniques, such as fax, e-mail, file transfer, reports, and data mining have been developed for public health information transmission. As a summary, the existing public health information systems have adopted a variety of data sources, transmission standards, and collection techniques.",

            "text": "To date, the existing public health information systems have not provided adequate support to the government agencies and public health researchers due to some unresolved issues. One major issue is related to data sources. Most of public health data are typically collected on as needed basis and maintained locally. This localized process unavoidably limits the access to important public health data by health care providers and the public. Moreover, it creates problems for data analysis. For example, local data may not include enough incidents with demographic diversity to account for the differences between functional groups, ages, as well as other factors. In addition to the problems associated with data sources, the diversity of data transmission standards and collection techniques makes the collected data less accessible to public health researchers. In particular, most local healthcare data are paper-based and may not be reported or transferred in a timely fashion. In addition, the major electronic data transmission standards of the existing public health systems, such as Text, XML, or e-mail, are not standardized means for data sharing. (1) Therefore, standardized electronic transmission will be more valuable for supporting public health data reporting, especially with the emerging reporting code management tools and automatic reporting techniques, such as text templates. To reach this goal, the CDC and eHealth Initiative Public Private Collaboration have developed implementation guidelines for public health reporting of chief complaint information using version 2.3.1 of HL7 standard protocol. (5) Subsequently, HL7 messages have been utilized in the Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance (RODS) system as the data transmission standard. (6) However, HL7 is not mandatory by federal laws and electronic medical records with HL7 have not been utilized sufficiently by public health practitioners. Therefore, there is a need to explore the possibility of developing a new national data collection system with standardized data sources, transmission standard, and data collection techniques.",

HIPAA Transaction Sets are standardized federal regulations for all health care providers and payers, so the HIPAA message transmissions should be deployed to a wide geographic area. In spite of its profound impact on overall healthcare industry, electronic communications and transactions, the existing public health systems are inadequate to support data collection based on HIPAA messages, and little is known about the underlying relationships between HIPAA and public health data.

HIPAA has three major components, including (1) Transactions and Code Sets, (2) Security Regulations, and (3) Privacy Regulations. An example of basic HIPAA transactions is shown in Fig. 2 . In Fig. 2 , a healthcare provider (such as a hospital) originates a transaction and sends claim information (HIPAA 837 message) to a payer (such as an insurance company). The HIPAA 837 message contains claim information about a person who holds a policy with the payer. The payer adjudicates the claim and sends an electronic remittance advice (RA) transaction (835 messages) back to the provider. Because the HIPAA 837 message contains a large amount of valuable health care information, it is virtually a gold mine for anyone who is interested in analyzing but has difficulty locating healthcare data.",

Major software vendors such as IBM, Microsoft, and GE Medical Systems have their own integrated e-commerce systems that support a suite of functionalities ranging from electronic data interchange to data management systems. Some of the e-commerce systems are for hospital information management with support for billing transactions. To comply with HIPAA regulations, these systems have to be modified to process billing transactions in HIPAA format. For example, IBM's WebSphere (11) Data Interchange supports ASC (Accredited Standards Committee) X12 standards of HIPAA as base function, which enables customers to send and receive HIPAA transactions. It validates the inbound or outbound transmission and then transforms the transaction from X12 to XML. The support for HIPAA includes collaborations for HIPAA transactions that enable integration with customers' existing back-end data processing systems using the IBM WebSphere Interchange Server and the IBM Web-Sphere Business Integration Collaborations for HIPAA Transactions. Smaller software vendors provide HIPAA compliance component that can be integrated in existing e-commerce systems. For example, iWay corporation's HIPAA eBusiness Adapter is fully compatible with IBM WebSphere Data Interchange Server and can be used as a plugin for translating HIPAA transactions. Other vendors such as HIPAA Accelerator Inc. provide alternative medical management systems that address the needs of HIPAA compliance in the areas of medical record management; privacy and security protection; and information dissemination.",

A number of identified public health variables are listed in Table I . Public health variables embedded in HIPAA messages were discovered through studying the transaction sets of HIPAA, in particular the HIPAA 837 messages sent from hospitals to payers. It shows that almost all the important public health variables can be found in HIPAA transaction segments (see Table I ). For example, patient's gender information can be found in the HIPAA DMG (Demographics) segment. Moreover, patient's diagnosis, such as West Nile virus (coded as 066.4 in ICD-9) can be found in the HIPAA HI (high) segment. Overall, this study indicates that HIPAA messages contain most of public health information, which may be extracted for developing a public health information system.",

Its current implementation is limited to dental claims to provide a simple, yet comprehensive enough, application of the conversion to/from HIPAA messages. However, the general design guidelines of this system can be used as a reference in processing other types of HIPAA messages. The process involves the transformation of the incoming HIPAA messages by applying all the mapping rules that have been defined at design time. While the document is being transformed to XML, validation checks are performed. A \"Rules file\" (provided for the specifics of dental insurance claims) is utilized. Converting from XML to HIPAA is the reverse process, which utilizes the XSLT style sheet file to define the rules of mapping between the two formats. For example, the HIPAA message shown in Fig. 3a can be translated into an XML document shown in the screen shot in Fig. 3b . After transforming HIPAA messages to XML documents, we can easily apply some data manipulation operations on these documents such as erasing certain contents from the documents and retrieving public health information. The application also has the ability to perform de-identification. That is, the application can strip off the identification portion of the claim based on certain criteria provided by the user. The identification portion may be related to the insurance subscriber, the insurance provider, or the healthcare institution. Removing the identification section lets the system look at the claim records anonymously. This feature might be quite useful for history tracking purposes or for generating summary reports when the identity of the record is of no importance.",

The HIPAA message filter exams the HIPAA 837 message originated from a hospital to insurance companies, collects useful public health information in that message based on predefined filter rules, and sends the result to the HIPAA database. Based on the data sent from HIPAA message filters, the HIPAA database provides functions for information input, storage, management, query, and supports GIS functions. The GIS component, including a map server, web server, and web browser provides functions for interactive display, GIS query, and GIS data dissemination.

To retrieve information flexibly, we use a set of formatted filter rules to determine which parts of the XML information we want to keep. The filter is a client application installed in the host machine of the healthcare providers or payers. Thus, the XML-filter maintains the set of filter rules using either the local file system or a database of the host machine.

We could make the filter rules coarse so that we only filter out non-related data entries of the HIPAA messages. For example, the entries related to financial transactions of a particular patient's visit are removed. We choose to keep all the diagnostic information and some of the patient's geographic data. Such filtering policy can be viewed as simple transaction logging. Coarse filter rules are simple to implement and efficient for processing. However, the retrieved data may not be precise for our purpose of health demographic research. For instance, if we are interested in a particular kind of disease in one geographic region, then we have to search the whole data set logged by our filter component. Also, since the retrieved data is imprecise, we may have to store a large amount of data in our database system. Another potential drawback is that we are not able to observe the development of certain research experiments in real-time. For instance, we may be interested in detecting cases of fast-spreading contagious-diseases such as SARS as soon as the patients with such disease are discovered. With coarse filter rules, we can only first store raw data in a centralized database system and then mine useful information from the database. Therefore, we also explore the possibility of fine-tuned filter rules that can specify precisely what kind of health information we would like to retrieve and also we need to establish a mechanism to update such filter rules in real-time without stopping the filtering process. Designing fine-tuned filter rules is difficult not only because of the number of cases such as catalogue of diseases we have to consider but because we need to accommodate future requirement changes.",

Since the filter is attached to the host machine of the health providers or payers, we need to provide sufficient security guarantee that the filter does not comprise the security of the software system in the host machine. Also, we follow a strict privacy standard so that the data retrieved by our filter does not reveal privacy information of the parties involved in the HIPAA messages. From the perspective of the host machine, the filter is an application from un-trusted sources. Therefore, limited system resource may be made available to the filter. For instance, the filter may only be able to use file system of specified directories and access network by connecting to a limited number of IP addresses via a specified communication protocol. Specifically, we implement our filter as a software plug-in written in platform independent language such as Java. Most computing platforms support Java Virtual Machine, which provides a security runtime environment for Java-based applications. The host machine could specify a security policy for running the filter programs and the security properties specified in the policy are enforced automatically by the virtual machine. The filter should not comprise the security of host machine either directly or indirectly by containing security loopholes that could be exploited by malicious entities. The main vulnerability of the filter is the communication channel. HIPAA security regulations require methods of protecting the data in transport, such as data encryption, secure sockets, secure shell tunneling, or the use of a virtual private network. We consider using some standard encryption techniques such as public-key cryptography to authenticate the identities of the central database and also the filters in the host machines. Also, using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Protocol can safeguard the data communication channel between the filters and the central database. The SSL protocol is supported by a number of language systems such as the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) implemented in Java 2 standard development kit.",

The HIPAA relational database model includes numbers of tables, such as Claim, Referral, Claim-Target, Clinical-Info, Message-header, Claim-Medical-Info, Drug-Info, Contact-Method, etc. The data model for 837 transactions is more complex than the model for 835 transactions. The logical and physical design for the HIPAA database should be further optimized based on the feedback in the future.

In particular, GIS interactive display function comprises zoom in, zoom out, zoom last, zoom to full map extent, pan, identify, redraw, etc. These functions provide the flexibilities for researchers with emphasis in an area of their interests. For example, although these public health data are collected nationally, a researcher may be only interested in West Nile Virus in Wisconsin. In this case, he may use these functions to highlight the State of Wisconsin only. In addition to the display functions, GIS query provides necessary information with users' requests. GIS query is divided into two categories: attribute data query and spatial data query. Attribute data query involves searching by attribute information in the HIPAA database. For example, a user may query the geographic distribution of West Nile Virus by specifying the disease name. Spatial query indicates the searches according to spatial locations. For instance, a researcher may be interested in knowing how many accidents took place within 1 mile buffer of a high school. In this case, the researcher can query the information through the location and buffer of the high school using spatial query tools. The other important function of this system is the ability to disseminate public health data. Researchers can request public health data for further analysis. In particular, two formats of data will be provided. The first is the table format for researchers with little or no experiences in GIS and the second is the GIS database format for researchers with more GIS knowledge.",

The first tier, web browser, provides an interface to users to access and query public health data. The second tier, web server, transmits information between web browser and application server.

This paper introduces a new data source-HIPAA message, and argues its applicability to the development of a standardized public health information system. As a further step, this paper proposes a prototype system design for collecting public health data with HIPAA messages. In particular, three conclusions may be obtained as follows: First, HIPAA messages may serve as standardized data source, since their formats are strictly defined by federal guidlines and their processing tools are widely supported by technology companies. Moreover, federal regulations mandate that all health care providers and payer use HIPAA messages to conduct financial transactions electronically. Second, HIPAA messages are applicable as a data source for collecting public health information. We have shown that HIPAA messages can provide sufficient amount of public health information while complying with privacy regulations. Moreover, our prototype implementation indicates that it is feasible to extract public health information from HIPAA messages. Finally, a standardized public health information system with HIPAA messages as data resource may be realized.

            "text": "1. Minimizing data redundancy is an important aspect of the filter design. Because of the transactional nature of HIPAA messages, the content of many messages may be repetitive so that simple filtering will result in data redundancy that not only overwhelms the data storage capacity of our centralized database system but also makes data mining difficult and results in imprecision in the subsequent analysis of health demographics. The system should have the ability to identify repetitive information exchanged with HIPAA messages. To have such ability, we must record some identification information of health records. Also, we need to avoid recording contents from follow-up messages. For example, when a hospital initializes a billing transaction to an insurance company, the insurance company may send some follow-up messages to correct errors or clarify ambiguities. We need to be able to recognize the repeated information contained in the messages and only record a single instance for each interesting case. The filter rules need to handle the data redundancy problem and storage issues should be optimized basing on the feedbacks in the future. 2. Integration with existing systems in the host machine of the health care providers and payers is one of the most important aspect of system implementation. The filter system needs to intercept the HIPAA messages sent and received by the software system in the host machine. Unfortunately, different health care providers and payers may use different data management software to process the HIPAA messages and it is difficult to build a filter system that can interact with all these products. Therefore, it is desirable to have a standard way to access HIPAA messages that is independent of the data management software. This actually is quite challenging since it requires the cooperation of the software vendors that provide HIPAA transaction support. One possibility is to identify a widely used HIPAA-XML adaptor (which converts HIPAA messages to XML documents for a variety of information systems) and then uses its output as our data source. The alternative is to build customized connections for different data management software.",
