Viruses cause a variety of respiratory diseases in children from the common cold to life-threatening pneumonia and bronchiolitis. The host reacts to a viral infection with a combination of innate and adaptive immune mechanisms, usually resulting in the clearance of the virus and clinical recovery. However, there is an accumulating evidence for a number of viral infections that the host immune response actually enhances disease in the course of clearing virus from the infected organs.

In most infants as well as in older children and adults, RSV is the cause of upper respiratory tract infection with mild symptoms. However, in the very young, the infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract in approximately 40% of cases. One to three percent of infants develop bronchiolitis or pneumonia requiring hospitalization, with a considerable number requiring mechanical ventilatory support. Apart from the obvious respiratory symptoms, very young children frequently present with atypical symptoms such as impaired feeding, vomiting, lethargy, and apnea (Kneyber et al., 1998) . Several risk factors for more severe disease have been identified, including age less than 6 weeks, prematurity, pre-existent cardiorespiratory disease and immunological impairment (Bont and Kimpen, 2002) . Respiratory symptoms are directly related to airway pathology. Necrosis of the airway epithelium is a key phenomenon resulting in sloughing of the epithelial cells.

However, in some South American and Asian countries, adenovirus is the second most prevalent pathogen for acute lower respiratory tract infection in children after RSV (Carballal et al., 2002) . Although adenovirus infections in general occur the whole year round, respiratory adenovirus infections are most common during late winter, spring, and early summer. Adenovirus type 7, acquired by inhalation, has been associated with more severe lower respiratory tract disease (Larranaga et al., 2000) . Subtype-specific immunity occurs. However, some types are capable of establishing persistent asymptomatic infections in tonsils, adenoids, and intestines of infected hosts, and shedding can occur for months or years. children under 6-years old.

Two subtypes are clinically important respiratory pathogens in children, PIV-1 and PIV-3. PIV-1 is the main cause of croup in 2-6-year olds, while PIV-3 is responsible for parainfluenza bronchiolitis in children under 6-months old. PIV-4 only causes mild upper respiratory tract infections. Because of acute narrowing of the subglottic region of the larynx, moderate to severe croup may require emergency management with systemic or inhaled corticosteroids, which are effective in improving stridor in a few hours (Cetinkaya et al., 2004) . The hallmark cytopathic effect of acute infection with PIV-3 is comparable to that of RSV with extensive cell fusion resulting in syncytium formation.

Rhinoviruses can cause severe lower respiratory tract infection (Guittet et al., 2003; Papadopoulos, 2004) and in immunocompromised patients, life-threatening pneumonia. Rhinovirus is a positive-stranded RNA-virus belonging to the Picornavirus family and over 100 serotypes exist, making it difficult to develop an effective vaccine. Rhinovirus subtypes have been divided into a major and minor group with respect to the receptor used for cell entry (Table 4 .1). Major group rhinoviruses use epithelial intracellular adhesion molecule l (ICAM-1) for cell entry, while minor group viruses bind to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. During rhinovirus infection, a predominant granulocyte and monocyte recruitments are observed. While specific antibody production occurs, it is probably not required for viral clearance, although neutralizing antibodies can provide some temporary protection against rhinovirus reinfection (van Kempen et al., 1999) .

Rosenberg and Domachowske (2001) have suggested a beneficial role for eosinophils in RSV bronchiolitis.

Fascinating new players in host defense against viruses are pattern recognition receptors. Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) and CD14, both present in a complex on these cells, have been found to interact with RSV and receptor-binding results in triggering of the innate immune system. TLR-4 has been shown to activate NF-kB in macrophages of RSV-infected mice (Haeberle et al., 2002a, b) and TLR-4-deficient mice have impaired NK-cell and CD14\u03e9 cell trafficking and delayed viral clearance .

All human cells can produce IFN-\u2423/\u2424 in response to viral infection, while only T-cells and NK-cells produce IFN-\u2425. dsRNA also activates dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR) and NF-kB via distinct pathways.

This theory states that when infections occur early in infancy, there is a reduced ability to react with an appropriate antiviral Th1-response. Low IFN-\u2425 production may result in spread of the virus to the lower respiratory tract. This is in agreement with findings that in children with severe RSV lower respiratory tract infections, lower amounts of IFN-\u2425 are produced . The dynamics of this shift toward a more balanced Th1/Th2 immune response may differ between individuals. Both environmental factors and genetic make-up may contribute to a slower maturation of Th1 competence in some individuals. Respiratory virus infections in infancy and an atopic sensitization to aero-allergens, both of which are related to Th2-skewed responses and intermittent wheeze, may than synergistically result in persistent wheeze (Holt and Sly, 2002) . It is likely that more links between atopic sensitization and respiratory infections exist, while preventive RSV-IVIG treatment of children results in a decreased sensitization to aeroallergens as well.

However, it may also be true that small airways predispose to both asthma and airway symptoms from viral infections. Remodeling of the submucosal neural networks by RSV, as observed by Piedimonte et al., is also proposed to result in increased responsiveness to airway irritants (Piedimonte, 2002) . Walter et al. (2002) have proposed that paramyxoviral infection has the ability not only to induce acute hyperresponsiveness, but also to result in long-lasting changes in airway behavior. From mouse-studies with a PIV (SeV), it has been concluded that viruses cause long-term effects in epithelial cells, associated with airway reactivity and goblet cell hyperplasia. Long-term effects are induced by the virus in the acute phase, and later on, the presence of virus is no longer required for the persistence of symptoms.
