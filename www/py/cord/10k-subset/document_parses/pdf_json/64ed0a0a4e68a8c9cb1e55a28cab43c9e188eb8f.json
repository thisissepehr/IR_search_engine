In malaria pathophysiology obstruction of the microcirculation by parasitized red blood cells plays a central role [33] . Pre-existing microangiopathy could thus add to the deleterious effects of microcirculatory blood flow obstruction in acute falciparum malaria. Diabetes mellitus, lipid disorders, and hypertension are key factors for the development of microangiopathy. Arterial hypertension induces two types of diffuse structural changes in the systemic microcirculation: rarefaction and remodelling. Rarefaction refers to an abnormally reduced density of arterioles, capillaries and possibly venules [34] . Remodelling leads to a structural reduction in lumen diameter of resistance small arteries and arterioles [35] . While both structural modifications are seen in hypertensive patients, remodelling seems to play a paramount role in long-term elevation of systemic vascular resistance. In addition to these structural changes, hypertension as well as diabetes induces functional changes in the microvasculature. Hypertension-and diabetes-related endothelial dysfunction leads to reduced bioavailability of local vasodilators (such as NO and prostacyclin) and increased formation of vasoconstrictors and reactive oxygen species, balancing the microvasculature towards vasoconstriction. These functional microvascular changes result in increased systemic vascular resistance and reduced oxygen delivery to target organs [36] . Pre-existing hypertension-and diabetes-associated microangiopathy may thus potentiate the reduced oxygen supply to vital organs caused by imported falciparum malaria, thereby facilitating severe forms of the disease (Additional file 1).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 177, "end": 181, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 669, "end": 673, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 782, "end": 786, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1491, "end": 1495, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Similar to diabetes and hypertension lipid disorders promote development of microangiopathy [37] .

Not only the number of chronic conditions but also the seriousness of underlying co-morbidity (assessed by age-adjusted Charleson co-morbidity index) influenced the risk for development of severe falciparum malaria. One of the individual diagnoses responsible for this association was hypertension. With a prevalence of 9.2% hypertension was the single most common chronic condition in the study population. Multivariable analysis was therefore robust and revealed that hypertensive individuals had a threefold increased risk of developing severe imported falciparum malaria compared to patients without hypertension. With increased after-load, hypertensive cardiomyopathy and, most importantly, pre-existing microangiopathy, there were plausible pathophysiologic explanations for this association (Additional file 2). The epidemiologic heterogeneity of the cohort, however, required a more detailed interpretation of the results. As expected, prevalence of hypertension was higher among patients of endemic origin. Simultaneously, median age was significantly lower in this subgroup, with only 4 patients being \u2265 60 years. Yet, hypertension appeared to be independently associated with development of severe malaria regardless of origin.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The much lower case numbers for individuals with cardiovascular diseases, lipid disorders und alcoholism warranted a more careful interpretation of the association of these conditions with severe malaria. Yet-although statistically not significant in the final multivariable model-there was also a strong trend towards an increased risk for severe disease in patients with cardiovascular diseases in the study of Wyss et al. [11] . Besides, older age, alcohol use, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, dyslipidaemia and hypertension have also been associated with an increased risk for sepsis [38] , a condition that shares certain features with falciparum malaria. Similar to the findings of the present study, the risk of sepsis increases with the number chronic medical conditions. Fig. 2 Falciparum malaria pathophysiology interferes with oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues on multiple levels. Oxygen delivery depends on heart rate, stroke volume, haemoglobin level and arterial oxygen saturation. Changes in one parameter can normally be compensated for by others. However, the key elements of falciparum malaria pathophysiology (grey boxes) do not just interfere with all components of oxygen delivery simultaneously, but they may also augment each other. If the capabilities for compensation are limited by pre-existing chronic co-morbidities, development of life-threatening complications such as metabolic acidosis and shock is facilitated. In a recent study from India, for instance, Mohanty et al. demonstrated that clinical and radiologic findings in cerebral malaria are largely consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) [40] . Hypertension is one of the known etiologies of PRES. Abbreviations: ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome; CaO 2 , arterial oxygen content; CO, cardiac output; DO 2 , oxygen delivery; haemoglobin level; HR, heart rate; PaO 2 , partial arterial oxygen pressure; RBC, red blood cell; SaO 2 , arterial oxygen saturation; SV, stroke volume; SVR, systemic vascular resistance These findings have implications for supportive therapy of imported falciparum malaria. Effective anti-malarials usually achieve complete parasite clearance within 96 h of initiation. Aim of supportive therapy is to prevent the patient from harm due to the systemic effects of the disease. This is of particular importance in the prognostically decisive first 48 h of treatment. Yet, endothelial activation and inflammation can persist for up to 28 days after therapy (the so-called \"post-treatment inflammatory effect\") [39] . The supportive therapy must, therefore, meet the specific pathophysiologic requirements of falciparum malaria well beyond completion of antimalarial therapy. Support of the cardiovascular system in severe malaria can be provided by numerous interventions such as correction of hypovolaemia by careful rehydration, controlling tachycardia in atrial fibrillation, maintaining adequate haemoglobin levels in order to ensure sufficient oxygenation-especially in concomitant coronary artery disease-or by providing inotropes in myocardial failure. The data presented here indicate that reducing an increased after-load with appropriate antihypertensives is another important intervention.
