Laboratory experiments suggest that virus-induced cytokine dysregulation may contribute to disease severity [6] [7] [8] [9] . To assess the relevance of these findings for human disease, we performed virological and immunological studies in 18 individuals with H5N1 and 8 individuals infected with human influenza virus subtypes. Influenza H5N1 infection in humans is characterized by high pharyngeal virus loads and frequent detection of viral RNA in rectum and blood. Viral RNA in blood was present only in fatal H5N1 cases and was associated with higher pharyngeal viral loads. We observed low peripheral blood T-lymphocyte counts and high chemokine and cytokine levels in H5N1-infected individuals, particularly in those who died, and these correlated with pharyngeal viral loads. Genetic characterization of H5N1 viruses revealed mutations in the viral polymerase complex associated with mammalian adaptation and virulence. Our observations indicate that high viral load, and the resulting intense inflammatory responses, are central to influenza H5N1 pathogenesis. The focus of clinical management should be on preventing this intense cytokine response, by early diagnosis and effective antiviral treatment.",

High replication efficiency, broad tissue tropism and systemic replication seem to determine the pathogenicity of H5N1 viruses in animals [3] [4] [5] . To examine the relevance of these viral properties in the context of human disease, we carried out virological analyses in respiratory and non-respiratory specimens of 18 previously healthy individuals with influenza H5N1 who were admitted to referral hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City during the years 2004 and 2005, of whom 13 died. (Table 1) . For comparison, we studied eight patients who were hospitalized during the same period with human influenza H3N2 or H1N1. These patients presented earlier in the course of illness (Table 1) , which may be explained by their origin from Ho Chi Minh City or neighboring provinces, in contrast with H5N1 patients who were mostly from more distant provinces.",

Genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis revealed that all viral strains were of the genotype Z, H5N1 sublineage of viruses prevalent in Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand, as previously reported 10 . Pairwise comparison of all gene segments of viruses isolated from eight fatal and four surviving cases did not reveal unique amino acid changes in either group. No viruses contained Glu92 in the NS1 protein, which is associated with increased virulence of H5N1 viruses 6 , but all contained the recently reported PDZdomain ligand ESEV 11 . An E627K substitution in the viral polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), which is associated with adaptation and virulence of H5N1 viruses in mammals 12 , was present in five of eight isolates from fatal cases and in three of four isolates from patients who survived. There was no association between the presence of Lys627 and clinical outcome (data not shown). Notably, three of four viruses without this substitution, but none of the viruses containing Lys627, contained an D701N substitution in PB2 that has been associated with adaptation of H7N7 viruses to mammalian cells 13 . This suggests that the D701N substitution may compensate for the absence of Lys627 in conferring enhanced viral polymerase activity and virulence in the mammalian host. Other amino-acid residues in the viral polymerase complex implicated in mammalian adaptation 13 , including Pro13 in polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1) and Arg615 in polymerase acidic protein (PA), were present in all viruses. These observations are in agreement with recent studies demonstrating the importance of the viral polymerase complex for H5N1 virulence in mammals 14 .",

Tracheal aspirates obtained from two patients during the course of illness showed more prolonged detection of viral RNA and at substantially higher levels as compared with corresponding nasopharyngeal swabs (Supplementary Fig. 2 online) . Particularly in the pharynx, viral RNA levels were higher in H5N1-infected individuals than in individuals infected with human influenza H3N2 or H1N1, despite presentation later in the course of the illness ( Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1 ). The highest viral RNA levels occurred in H5N1-infected individuals who died ( Table 2) , suggesting that the level of viral replication influences outcome. Viral RNA could also be detected in blood specimens from 9 of 16 H5N1-infected individuals and in the rectal swabs from 5 of 7 of these individuals ( Table 2) . It remains unclear whether the detection of virus in rectal specimens reflects genuine gastrointestinal infection. However, symptoms of diarrhea frequently occur during influenza H5N1 (refs. 1,2,15) and were present in three of the five individuals with detectable viral RNA in the rectum. No viral RNA was present in the blood of surviving H5N1-infected individuals or in those with human influenza. Individuals with detectable H5N1 RNA in blood also had higher pharyngeal viral loads (median 7.4 log 10 copies per ml; range 5.1-7.4) than those without evidence of H5N1 RNA (6.0 log 10 copies per ml; range 4.3-7.0; P \u00bc 0.021), suggesting that the presence of viral RNA in blood reflects an overall high viral burden. Virus was also isolated from one rectal and one serum specimen from a patient who presented with diarrhea and coma as the only initial symptoms 16 . The failure to isolate virus from remaining non-respiratory specimens ( Table 2 ) could suggest that the viral RNA does not necessarily reflect replicating virus, but may also reflect relatively low viral loads, loss of replication-competent virus during storage and limitations in the sensitivity of viral culture. The recent isolation of H5N1 virus from the plasma of a patient from Thailand 17 confirmed that viremia can occur. Although viremia indicates the potential of the H5N1 virus to disseminate systemically, it remains unclear whether virus replication commonly occurs in non-respiratory organs. Postmortem examinations have not shown evidence of extrapulmonary infection, but revealed reactive hemophagocytosis (which is believed to be a cytokine-driven condition) as the most prominent feature 18, 19 . In vitro and animal experiments also implicate cytokine Rates of virus isolation, detection of viral RNA and viral loads in nasopharyngeal, rectal and blood specimens of patients with influenza H5N1 and H3N2 or H1N1. Viral loads are given as log 10 cDNA copies per ml of viral transport medium.

Observations in our subjects support a role for the inflammatory response in the pathogenesis of human H5N1 disease. Peripheral lymphopenia often accompanies H5N1 infection 1,2 . Measurement of peripheral blood lymphocyte counts in a subset of our subjects showed low total and CD3 + lymphocyte counts and inverted ratios of CD4 + to CD8 + cells in H5N1-infected individuals, particularly in those who died (Supplementary Table 1 online). Total and CD3 + lymphocyte numbers in H5N1-infected individuals correlated inversely with pharyngeal viral RNA load (Fig. 1a,b) , suggesting an association between lymphopenia and the level of viral replication. In addition to decreased production of lymphocytes (as suggested by bone marrow hypoplasia reported in one individual 18 ), or increased destruction through apoptosis (as suggested by in vitro and mouse experiments with H5N1 viruses 20,21 ), peripheral blood lymphopenia may result from trafficking of lymphocytes to infected tissue. How-ever, postmortem studies in H5N1-infected individuals have not shown a predominance of lymphocytes, but instead of macrophages, in pulmonary infiltrates 19 . The latter observation is in agreement with the chemokine profile that was measured in peripheral blood of the individuals in this study ( Table 3) : levels of IP-10, MIG and MCP-1 (chemoattractants of monocytes and macrophages that are produced in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages 9,22,23 ) were elevated in patients with avian and human subtypes of influenza, but were higher in H5N1-infected individuals and particularly high in those who died ( Table 3) . Levels of the neutrophil chemoattractant interleukin (IL)-8 were also elevated in H5N1-infected individuals, particularly in those who died ( Table 3) . This chemokine is produced by bronchial epithelial cells and may function in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 24 , which may be particularly relevant to H5N1 influenza, as progression to respiratory failure is associated with development of ARDS 15 .",

We carried out flow cytometric analyses of whole-blood stained with fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies on a FACScalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Plasma concentrations of the cytokines IFN-g, IL-2, IL-5, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-1b, TNF-a and IL-12p70 and of the chemokines MCP-1, IP-10, MIG, RANTES and IL-8 were measured using cytometric bead-array assays (Becton Dickinson) according to the manufacturers' instructions, with the exception that all samples were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde before analysis. IFN-a plasma concentrations were measured using a commercial capture ELISA assay (Biosource International) according to the manufacturers' instructions.",

For statistical purposes, the lower detection limit of the assay (1,000 cDNA copies per ml) was used in cases of negative test results of virus load measurements, and a value of 0.1 pg ml -1 was used in cases of undetectable concentrations of cytokines or chemokines in specimens. The Mann-Whitney U or Fisher exact tests were used for group comparisons of numerical and categorical data respectively, and the Wilcoxon ranked-sum test was used for comparison of viral load in paired throat and nasal swabs. Correlations between viral load and immunological parameters in specimens obtained on the same day were calculated using Spearman's rank correlation test. For all analyses, a P value of less than 0.05 derived from a two-tailed test was considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 14.0 for Windows software (SPSS Inc). ",
