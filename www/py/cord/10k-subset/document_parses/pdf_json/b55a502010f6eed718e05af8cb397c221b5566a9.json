Fortunately, the bill died in the state senate. Although this anecdote might appear a historical curiosity to scientists today, nonexperts are becoming more and more prominent in formulating public policy decisions that require an understanding of subtle and complex scientific and technological phenomena.",

To gauge public opinion in advance of a decision scheduled for late in the year on whether to allow commercial planting of GM crops, at great expense the UK government sponsored a series of public discussions (ironically termed 'GM Nation') around the country, as well as using more conventional methods, such as focus groups. Local authorities and various organizations held hundreds of additional public meetings on the subject.",

But the reality argues otherwise. Mark Henderson, science correspondent for The Times (London) newspaper, offered this view of the half-millionpound initiative: \"The exercise has been farce from start to finish. I'm not sure I want the man in the street to set Britain's science, technology and agriculture policy. One of the six meetings. . .spent much of its time discussing whether the SARS virus might come from GM cotton in China. It's more likely to have come from outer space\" 3 . Henderson went on to say that the meetings were dominated by anti-technology zealots, the only faction that was well enough organized and cared enough about the issue to attend.",

The first of these NSF-funded groups tackled regulatory policy toward agricultural biotechnology, and recommended that the government tighten regulations for growing GM crops, including adding a new requirement that the foods from these crops be labeled to identify them for consumers. Both of these proposals are unwarranted, inappropriate and contrary to the recommendations of experts, including those within the government and in the scientific community 7, 8 . The output of the citizens' panel illustrates that such undertakings have limitations both in theory and practice: nonexperts are too much subject both to their own prejudices and to the specific choice of materials and advocates to whom they are exposed.",
