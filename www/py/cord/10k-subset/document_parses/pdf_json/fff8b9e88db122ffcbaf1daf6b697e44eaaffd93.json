His past medical history included inferior myocardial infarction, tobacco and alcohol abuse, and cancer of the right tonsil considered cured 2 years previously. On admission, the physical examination revealed the following vital signs: temperature 39.5 C, respiratory rate 22 breaths/min, blood pressure 80/45 mm Hg, and pulse 100 beats/min, after volume expansion and under dopamine (8 mg/kg per min) and dobutamine (5 mg/kg per min) infusion. Crepitant rales were found bilaterally. The patient was alert and oriented. Chest radiograph showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates consistent with ARDS. Arterial blood gases obtained under oxygen therapy were pH 7.46, arterial carbon dioxide tension 6.3 kPa, arterial oxygen tension 7 kPa, and oxygen saturation 87 %. Lactic acid was 3.2 mmol/l. His white blood cell count was 2400/mm 3 , hemoglobin 9.9 g/ dl, and platelet count 96 000/mm 3 . Cardiac tissue enzymes were normal. The enzymelinked immunosorbent assay test for HIV 1 and 2 was negative. The patient was intu-bated, and mechanical ventilation was promptly instituted because of refractory hypoxemia. A two-dimensional Doppler transthoracic echocardiography showed left ventricular depressed systolic function without any indication for a preload increase, consistent with severe septic shock. Then the dobutamine dose was increased to 20 mg/kg per min and norepinephrine infusion was started due to persistent hypotension. Specimens of urine, blood, and bronchial secretions were sent for culture, and empirical antibiotic treatment consisting of ceftriaxone, ofloxacin, and antituberculosis drugs (rifampin, isoniazid, and ethambutol) was begun. Direct examination of bronchoalveolar lavage revealed numerous acid-fast bacilli, subsequently identified as M. tuberculosis susceptible to the drugs given. Routine blood and urine cultures were negative. Despite antituberculous therapy, mechanical ventilation, and maximum use of catecholamine combination therapy, his condition continued to worsen and he died on day 3 in multiple organ failure. No autopsy was performed.",

Tumor necrosis factor production from mycobacterial products is assumed to be responsible for septic shock hemodynamic alteration [2] . Of these nine cases, seven were HIV-infected patients [1, 3\u00b15] , and two were considered to be at high risk for HIV disease, although testing had not been performed [2] . It is well known that adults infected by HIV have increased susceptibility to M. tuberculosis and progress more rapidly to disease. Conversely, the case presented herein is one of the first reported of hemodynamic septic shock due to M. tuberculosis in a patient without HIV. Because two-dimensional echocardiography is considered a reliable technique to evaluate left ventricle preload and contractility in septic shock [6] , we did not used pulmonary artery catheterization to monitor our patient's hemodynamic profile. For this patient, with a previous history of cancer, several weeks of weight loss, anorexia, asthenia, combined with respiratory symptoms and chest radiographic aspects on ad-mission led to the diagnosis. However, despite initiation of prompt and appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy and maximum supportive therapy, the infection proved refractory and the patient died.",
