Methods The retrospective case study was conducted at the Pediatric ward and Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) dedicated to the children (aged 18 years or younger) with influenza-like illness (ILI) with positive laboratory test results for pandemic H1N1 by reverse-transcriptase polymerasechain-reaction assay. Results Between August 2009 and January 2010, a total of 100 children were hospitalized with suspected 2009 H1N1 influenza with Category \"C\" as described by the Government of India. Twenty five patients were positive for H1N1 and 9 for seasonal influenza A. The most common presentation (H1N1 positive) was with fever (100%), cough (100%), coryza (52%), respiratory distress (88%), vomiting (28%) and diarrhea (16%). One child presented with hypernatremic dehydration and seizures (Serum sodium 174 meq/l). Of the H1N1 positive hospitalized children, 7 (28%) had respiratory failure and required PICU admission, 4 (16%) required mechanical ventilation, and 3 (12%) died.

Firstly, being a hospital based (tertiary referral hospital) and not a community based study there would be a bias towards sicker cases. Secondly, since only Category \"C\" patients were tested for pandemic H1N1 virus as per the national guidelines, the exact incidence of 2009 H1N1 influenza on morbidity and mortality is difficult to calculate. Present data could not be compared to seasonal Influenza from the previous years since there is poor routine surveillance from India, although it appears to be statistically similar with our small cohort. Thirdly, the sample size was small and hence the predictors of severe disease or mortality could not be evaluated using a regression model. Also very few patients had underlying problems and hence whether the disease would have a greater impact on some conditions is difficult to predict. Fourthly, we could not study other viruses which could be co-morbid or could be there in the negative group both for H1N1 and seasonal influenza A. Their contribution cannot be ruled out. Since this group would be very heterogeneous it was not compared. Our data reiterates the fact that influenza can present with a wide spectrum of disease from very mild self limiting upper respiratory tract infection to very severe fatal pneumonias. Children presenting with rapidly developing pneumonias with typical radiological finding (bilateral, symmetric, and multifocal areas of consolidation) should be evaluated for Influenza and not just be treated for pyogenic infections. Where in the algorithm of diagnosis of pneumonias should a RT-PCR be incorporated would have to be decided, the investigation being expensive and available in only specialized laboratories at present. Also, routine surveillance for seasonal influenza should be enhanced in developing countries like India.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Contributions Ankit Parakh: patient management, acquisition of data, literature search, statistical analysis, interpretation and writing.
