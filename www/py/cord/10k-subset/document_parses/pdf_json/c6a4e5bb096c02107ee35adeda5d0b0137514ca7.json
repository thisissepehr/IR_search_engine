The self-aggregating AA protein responsible for this disease is a byproduct of serum amyloid A (SAA) protein degradation. Transcriptional induction of the SAA1 gene is dependent on both C/EBP\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB cis-acting elements within the promoter region. In cheetahs, 2 alleles exist for a single guanine nucleotide deletion in the putative NF-\u03baB binding site. In this study, a novel genotyping assay was developed to screen for the alleles. The results show that the SAA1A \u221297delG allele is associated with decreased SAA protein concentrations in the serum of captive cheetahs (n = 58), suggesting genetic differences at this locus may be affecting AA amyloidosis prevalence. However, there was no significant difference in the frequency of the SAA1A \u221297delG allele between individuals confirmed AA amyloidosis positive versus AA amyloidosis negative at the time of necropsy (n = 48). Thus, even though there is evidence that having more copies of the SAA1A \u221297delG allele results in a potentially protective decrease in serum concentrations of SAA protein in captive cheetahs, genotype is not associated with this disease within the North American population.

In some cases, susceptibility appears to be genetic (familial amyloidosis), as observed in Shar-Pei dogs (Rivas et al. 1993 ), Abyssinian (Boyce et al. 1984) and Siamese (van der Linde-Sipman et al. 1997) breeds of domestic cats, and black-footed cats (Terio et al. 2008 ). Among other species, AA amyloidosis is considered \"reactive\" and does not have a genetic basis, but rather appears secondary to other inflammatory conditions, as observed in bighorn sheep (Hadlow and Jellison 1962) , bat (Gruber and Linke 1996) , Dorcas gazelle (Rideout et al. 1989 ) and humans (De Beer et al. 1982) . Domestic cats are an interesting species to examine because the traditional domestic short hair (DSH) cat is not often affected by amyloidosis, while the Siamese and Abyssinian breeds have inherited forms of the disease, though the genetic variants implicated in the heritable disease are different between these 2 breeds (Niewold et al. 1999) . The cheetah AA protein amino acid sequence is more similar to that of Abyssinian cats than DSH cats, having concordance at 5 of 8 positions of variability with Abyssinian cats but only 2 with DSH cats , which suggests the possibility that cheetah AA protein may be structured in a way that makes it more amyloidogenic compared to the domestic cat AA protein. However, AA amyloidosis is uncommon among wild cheetahs (Munson et al. 2005) , suggesting that the amyloidosis observed in cheetahs is not of a true \"familial\" type and rather secondary to chronic inflammation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 157, "end": 175, "text": "(Rivas et al. 1993", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 190, "end": 209, "text": "(Boyce et al. 1984)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 304, "end": 322, "text": "(Terio et al. 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 514, "end": 540, "text": "(Hadlow and Jellison 1962)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 547, "end": 570, "text": "(Gruber and Linke 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 588, "end": 608, "text": "(Rideout et al. 1989", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 622, "end": 643, "text": "(De Beer et al. 1982)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 968, "end": 989, "text": "(Niewold et al. 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1407, "end": 1427, "text": "(Munson et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The identification of the SNP in the promoter region of the SAA1A gene in cheetahs by Zhang et al.

This study shows that the SAA1A \u221297delG allele is similarly associated with a decrease in the SAA concentration in serum of captive cheetahs. However, genetic variation only accounted for 2.7% of the total phenotypic variation in SAA concentration. Much greater significant differences in SAA concentrations were observed between sick and healthy cheetahs. Sick cheetahs had significantly higher SAA concentrations compared to healthy cheetahs. This result is unsurprising given that SAA is an APP which is upregulated in response to inflammation.

Interestingly, cheetahs have a T at the \u221213 position in the SAA1 promoter (Zhang et al. 2008 ) and this nucleotide position is not polymorphic (Chen et al. 2012 ), therefore all cheetahs may be predisposed to developing secondary AA amyloidosis in the presence of chronic inflammation. It has been shown that persistently elevated SAA concentration leads to increased amyloid load and organ deterioration in humans (Gillmore et al. 2001) : mortality, amyloid burden, and renal prognosis are all significantly correlated with serum SAA concentration (De Beer et al. 1982; Lachmann et al. 2007 ). Similar to cheetahs, the main manifestation of secondary amyloidosis in human patients is renal dysfunction and failure (Lachmann et al. 2007 ). Papendick et al. (1997) found that all cheetahs diagnosed with amyloidosis also suffered from other significant chronic inflammatory diseases in organs other than kidney, most commonly chronic lymphoplasmacytic gastritis. The prevalence of severe gastritis in captive cheetahs increased from 16% of individuals in pre-1990 necropsies to 43% of individuals in 1995, an increase almost parallel to the increase in AA amyloidosis prevalence observed in the same study . While close to 100% of captive cheetahs have some form of gastritis (Munson 1993; Munson et al. 1999; Munson et al. 2005) , 76% of cheetahs with amyloidosis have moderate to severe gastritis .
