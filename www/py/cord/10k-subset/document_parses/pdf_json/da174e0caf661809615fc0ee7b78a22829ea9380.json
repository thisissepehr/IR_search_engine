TonB-dependent receptors (TBDRs) are ubiquitous outer membrane \u03b2-barrel proteins; they play an important role in the recognition of siderophores during iron uptake. Here, in the APEC strain DE205B, we investigated the role of four putative TBDRs-ireA, 0007, 0008, and 2235-in iron uptake. Glutathione-S-transferase pulldown assays indicated that the proteins encoded by these genes directly interact with TonB. Moreover, the expression levels of all four genes were significantly upregulated under iron-depleted conditions compared with iron-rich conditions. The expression levels of several iron uptake-related genes were significantly increased in the ireA, 0007, 0008, and 2235 deletion strains, with the upregulation being the most prominent in the ireA deletion mutant. Furthermore, iron uptake by the ireA deletion strain was significantly increased compared to that by the wild-type strain. Moreover, a tonB mutant strain was constructed to study the effect of tonB deletion on the TBDRs. We found that regardless of the presence of tonB, the expression levels of the genes encoding the four TBDRs were regulated by fur. In conclusion, our findings indicated that ireA, 0007, 0008, and 2235 indeed encode TBDRs, with ireA having the most important role in iron uptake. These results should help future studies explore the mechanisms underlying the TonB-dependent iron uptake pathway.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

Strains of APEC and neonatal meningitis-associated E. coli (NMEC, a subpathotype of ExPEC), the latter of which causes infections in humans, reportedly share some common virulence genes [4] [5] [6] . It is thus particularly important to study the genes encoding virulence factors in APEC strains. These strains contain several virulence-associated genes that encode various virulence factors, including adhesins (fimC, ompA, papC), invasins (ibeA), avian haemolysins (hlyF), serum survival proteins (iss, ompT), and siderophores (iutA, fyuA, iroN); moreover, they show the presence of a pathogenicity island [7] [8] [9] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 147, "end": 150, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 151, "end": 153, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 448, "end": 451, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 640, "end": 643, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 644, "end": 647, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 648, "end": 651, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1062, "end": 1065, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1066, "end": 1069, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1070, "end": 1073, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Iron is a vital micronutrient that regulates enzyme activity and metabolism. This element plays a key role in basic cellular processes, such as cellular respiration, DNA replication, and electron transport and is accordingly essential for bacterial survival in host tissues [10] [11] [12] . Furthermore, iron is a necessary growth factor for bacteria and is reportedly involved in the expression of bacterial virulence factors [13] . Iron uptake factors evidently play a pivotal role in E. coli growth and pathogenesis. Bacteria employ different strategies to absorb iron from their environment, including siderophore-mediated iron uptake, which occurs on the cell surface [14] . In addition, bacteria either excessively reduce the external pH or dissolve iron oxide to meet their iron requirements by reducing ferric iron to a relatively soluble ferrous form. Another common strategy is to synthesize and secrete iron chelators, such as siderophores, as intracellular iron (Fe 2+ ) is rarely found in natural conditions, and Fe 2+ can be readily oxidized to Fe 3+ in the presence of oxygen and water [15] . Siderophores then combine with the available iron (Fe 3+ ) to form an iron-siderophore complex, which binds to specific receptor proteins on the bacterial cell surface, consequently entering cells via the TonBdependent transport system, followed by iron release. Siderophore-mediated ferric uptake requires specific outer membrane (OM) receptors, such as FhuA, FecA, and FepA, which reportedly exist in E. coli [16] . These OM receptors share the same structural properties and acquire energy by coupling with TonB proteins located in the inner membrane, and they are referred to as TonB-dependent receptors (TBDRs) [17] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 274, "end": 278, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 279, "end": 283, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 284, "end": 288, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 427, "end": 431, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 673, "end": 677, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1101, "end": 1105, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1519, "end": 1523, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1724, "end": 1728, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "TBDRs are known to actively transport ferric-siderophore complexes in Gram-negative bacteria, and they also transport diverse antibiotics, vitamins, nickel complexes, and carbohydrates [18] [19] [20] .

A single mutant strain for each of the three genes (0007, 0008, 2235) was constructed using the Red homologous recombination method in E. coli [26] . Briefly, for generation of the 0007 mutant strain, a gene-targeting fragment containing a homologous arm on both sides of 0007 was amplified by PCR using the plasmid pKD4 as the template, which contains the phage \u03bb Red system under the control of an arabinose promoter. Competent DE205B cells containing pKD46 were then prepared; l-arabinose was added to induce the expression of the phage \u03bb Red system, and the target fragments were transformed by electroporation into DE205B to replace 0007 with the resistance gene. The recombinant strain was screened by growth on LB plates supplemented with kanamycin and identified by cross-PCR. Details of the primers (0007-F/0007-R, K1, K2) used for amplification are listed in Additional file 1. Next, the temperature-sensitive plasmid pCP20 was transformed into the recombinant strain to remove the resistance gene. Finally, pCP20 was removed by growth at 42 \u00b0C for 24 h to obtain the mutant strain DE205B\u03940007 that did not show any resistance.
