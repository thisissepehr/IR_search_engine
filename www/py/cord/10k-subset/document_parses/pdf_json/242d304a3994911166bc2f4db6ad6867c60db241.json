However, how CPV-2 participates in cell regulation and immune response remains unknown. In this study, persistently infected MDCK cells were generated through culture passage of the CPV-2a-infected cells for ten generations. Our study showed that CPV-2a induces cell proliferation arrest and cell morphology alternation before the fourth generation, whereas, the cell morphology returns to normal after five times of passages. PCR detection of viral VP2 gene demonstrated that CPV-2a proliferate with cell passage. An immunofluorescence assay revealed that CPV-2a particles were mainly located in the cell nuclei of MDCK cell. Then transcriptome microarray revealed that gene expression pattern of MDCK with CPV-2a persistent infection is distinct compared with normal cells. Gene ontology annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome pathway analysis demonstrated that CPV-2a infection induces a series of membrane-associated genes expression, including many MHC protein or MHC-related complexes. These genes are closely related to signaling pathways of virus-host interaction, including antigen processing and presentation pathway, intestinal immune network, graftversus-host disease, and RIG-I-like helicases signaling pathway. In contrast, the suppressed genes mediated by CPV-2a showed low enrichment in any category, and were only involved in pathways linking to synthesis and metabolism of amino acids, which was confirmed by qPCR analysis.

KEGG pathway analysis revealed that these genes are closely related to signaling pathways of virus-host interaction, including antigen processing and presentation pathway, intestinal immune network, graft-versus-host disease and RLR signaling pathway (Table 3) . RLRs, together with Toll-like receptors and nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors, are three major receptor systems of PRRs in innate immunity for recognition of microorganisms in various cells [28] and are responsible for activation of antiviral immune responses (Fig. 6 , 7) . Our qPCR data also confirmed that CPV-2a infection activates immune-related genes (Fig. 8 ). All these results demonstrated that CPV-2a is a great immune activation agent. Actually, many other parvoviruses infection has been reported to activate immune response in virusinduced cell lines [35] [36] [37] [38] . Our results provided direct evidences that CPV-2a is also a potential immune cell activator. In contrast, down-modulated genes by CPV-2a are mainly involved in pathways linking to amino acid synthesis and metabolism (Table 3) , including glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, indicating that CPV-2a infection may affect cell metabolism. Previous reports have demonstrated that parvovirus showed preferential replication in tumor-derived and oncogene-transformed cells, as well as onco-suppressive activity in experimental animals [35] . By the reasons of these properties, parvovirus was widely used as delivery vectors for inducing host immune responses and antitumor effects. Parvovirus-based antitumor nanotools were rapidly developed in past two decades [36] [37] [38] [39] . As a member of parvovirus, CPV-2a causes severe disease in dogs, whereas it is not susceptible to many other species including human. Interestingly, infectious CPV particles could be confirmed to bind and enter human cells, but viral replication could not be accomplished [14] . In addition, CPV-2a has a specific cellular receptor, transferrin receptor, which is a characteristic high expressed carrier protein in tumor cells [40] . It provides the possibility to deliver drugs specifically to tumor cells utilizing CPV vector. Indeed, CPV, and CPV virus-like particles have been employed in drugs delivery and CPV is being investigated as a novel nanomaterial for delivery of genes and tumor targeting [41] . Together with our studies that CPV-2a activates the immune response signaling in susceptible cells, all these results suggested that CPV-2a is natural immune cell activator and antitumor vector. Nevertheless, several questions need further investigations. For example, which components are responsible for activation of immune-related signaling, viral structural proteins, nonstructural proteins, or nucleic acid? And how the CPV-2a activates immune signaling?", "cite_spans": [{"start": 379, "end": 383, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 384, "end": 387, "text": "25]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 864, "end": 868, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1238, "end": 1242, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1243, "end": 1247, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1248, "end": 1252, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1253, "end": 1257, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1827, "end": 1831, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2055, "end": 2059, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2060, "end": 2064, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2065, "end": 2069, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2070, "end": 2074, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2349, "end": 2353, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2504, "end": 2508, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2781, "end": 2785, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 167, "end": 175, "text": "(Fig. 5)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 641, "end": 650, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}, {"start": 934, "end": 946, "text": "(Fig. 6 , 7)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1031, "end": 1038, "text": "(Fig. 8", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1476, "end": 1485, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, our studies established a MDCK cell model with CPV-2a persistent infection, and found that CPV-2a virion localized in nuclei but failed to cause CPE in MDCK cells.

Yet, some studies mentioned that CPV-2a induces apoptosis [15, 17] , but our gene profiling data showed no connection between CPV-2a infection and apoptosis, which may be attribute to the virus types. This work extends our knowledge of CPV-2a-mediated cell infection and regulation. These findings will pave ways for developing novel antiviral strategy and nanomaterial for medicine.
