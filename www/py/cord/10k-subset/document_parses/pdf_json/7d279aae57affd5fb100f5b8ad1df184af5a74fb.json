The 1918 influenza pandemic was the greatest single human mortality event for which detailed records exist; epidemiological examination of such records is one of the few ways to look for prepandemic influenza activity. Genomic information from archived pathology specimens indicates that the pandemic virus was likely circulating for years before 1918 [1] . Distinctive lethal respiratory disease, considered retrospectively as identical to what was seen in 1918, had occurred at least 2 years previously in military populations in England and France [2] . Genomic evidence of the pandemic virus exists from US Army recruit camps as early as May 1918, several months before the increase in mortality [3] .",

Civilian deaths due to influenza had shown a distinct upwards shift after the 1890 pandemic in both the United Kingdom and New Zealand [4, 5] (see Supplementary Material). Prospective morbidity records were collected by the US Army from the time of the US Civil War (1862-1865) that distinguished between influenza and other respiratory illnesses, presumably based on clinical symptoms in an appropriate epidemiological context [6] . United States Army officer cadets at the US Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York were seen at a single medical clinic for more than a century with named daily records of each diagnosis serially recorded in ledger books. These 2 data sets from the entire US Army and the USMA at West Point were collected and examined to determine whether there were any epidemiological signatures that might have been due to pandemic influenza virus infections before both the 1890 and 1918 pandemics.",

These named individual diagnoses were serially recorded in a daily clinical register at USMA from the mid-19th century with only occasional gaps in these archival records, which are still kept at West Point [7] . Modern US Army cadets went through these clinic registers noting the respiratory-associated diagnoses; \"influenza\" or \"grippe\" was recorded as influenza with other respiratory diseases (bronchitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, tonsillitis, asthma, coryza, and catarrh) denoting noninfluenza illnesses. These diagnostic categories were non-overlapping. Annual assigned strength was obtained from the Register of Cadets to determine rates per 1000 men and associated mortality [8, 9] . Admissions to the USMA cadet inpatient facility were recorded in the Daily Sick Returns of the Corps of Cadets with general trends documented in the surgeon's contributions to the Annual Report of the Superintendent. Records were placed into a Microsoft Excel database and epidemiologically analyzed. Monthly influenza and pneumonia mortality rates from the late 19th and early 20th centuries were reported by Frost [10] in 1919 from the US State of Massachusetts and are included for comparison to events at USMA in New York.",

During the entire year of the 1918 influenza pandemic, 22 402 deaths from influenza and 15 308 deaths from pneumonia were recorded in the US Army [7] . Using total approximate strength of the US Army (3.4 million men in October 1918), the estimated mortality rates for 1918 are 6.6 and 4.5 deaths/1000 soldiers for influenza and pneumonia, respectively. Figure 1E and F consists of monthly information from USMA from December 1889 to June 1911. There was a 6-month gap in the records in 1911 where the ledger books could not be found. Influenza usually occurred as an end of year episodic illness that appeared in most but not every year as demonstrated in Figure 1E . Because USMA West Point specifically recruited cadets from each congressional district, there would have been exposure to respiratory pathogens from all 48 states, particularly because cadets were given rail passes for end of school year (summer) holiday leave to visit their home of origin. Other respiratory disease shown in Figure 1F is less consistent but also generally shows annual winter peaks. Years showing little influenza activity (eg, 1897-1898, 1907-1910) have corresponding large numbers of other respiratory disease, likely reflecting some diagnostic overlap depending on the practice of the various US Army medical officers at the USMA clinic. The Massachusetts influenza mortality data also shown in Figure 1E and F match the USMA morbidity information well with some exceptions (1896, 1911) , but the Massachusetts pneumonia mortality and USMA other respiratory illness curves are much more discordant [10] .",

            "text": "In retrospect, are there any indications that the 1890 or 1918 influenza pandemics were approaching given the likelihood that the respective viruses were circulating for some time before the pandemic? During the 2 to 3 years before both pandemics, there was little influenza activity reported from both the US Army and USMA. Perhaps this is an indication that the general population was progressively acquiring immunity to the major circulating influenza and/or respiratory viruses, opening up an evolutionary opportunity for new viral species that may have been formed as reassortments of multiple minority viruses. In 1916, influenza at USMA appears as an outlier that might reflect the increased influenza reported from New York City during the same time. Although one cannot see age range changes in a group of military cadets, New York City data indicated a shift towards young adults, as was seen later as a very remarkable and still unexplained characteristic of the 1918 influenza pandemic [12] . Animal reservoirs are important in influenza, but because swine influenza was widely regarded as a new disease of pigs in 1918, any swine contribution to the pandemic viruses of 1890 and 1918 remains uncertain [1] .",

            "text": "How might these findings be different from the modern situation? Reflecting what was seen in US civilians and in contrast to 1918, the US Army was much less affected by the pandemics of 1957 and 1968, with only a few percent of people ill at any one time and almost no influenza-related mortality [13] . The larger global population now moves at much greater frequency and speed circulating respiratory pathogens at much higher rates. Still, our understanding and certainly our ability to predict future pandemic events is extremely limited. The progressive decrease in influenza pandemic mortality globally through 2009, although certainly a very positive observation, may be more indicative of a human population with a much wider personal experience with influenza than any viral-specific mechanism or vaccine intervention. The value of historical epidemiological datasets over decades continues as one of the few ways to reconstruct pandemic events long after they occurred. Influenza pandemics have been sudden, unexpected events since before 1890 and are likely to remain so [14] .",
