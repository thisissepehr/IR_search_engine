Of the 75 taxa of Habronattus and outgroups studied, 47 have X 1 X 2 0 sex chromosomes in males, 10 have X 1 X 2 Y, 15 have X 1 X 2 X 3 Y, 2 have X0, and one has both X 1 X 2 0 and X 1 X 2 X 3 Y. Chromosome numbers and behavior suggest neo-Ys formed by an autosome-X fusion to make X 1 X 2 Y, with a second fusion to an autosome to make X 1 X 2 X 3 Y. Phylogeny shows at least 8-15 gains (or possibly some losses) of neo-Y (i.e., X-autosome fusions), a remarkable number for such a small clade. In contrast to the many X-autosome fusions, at most one autosome-autosome fusion is indicated. Origins of neo-Y are correlated significantly with distal localization of chiasmata, supporting White's hypothesis that evolution of neo-Y systems is facilitated by looser pairing (distal chiasmata) at meiosis. However, an alternative (or contributing) explanation for the correlation is that X-autosome fusions were selected to permit isolation of male-favored alleles to the neo-Y chromosome, aided by distal chiasmata limiting recombination. This intralocus sexual conflict hypothesis could explain both the many X-autosome fusions, and the stunning complexity of male Habronattus courtship displays.",

Although few have been examined by modern phylogenetic methods, many broad patterns have been described in the classical cytogenetic literature, with some clades notably conservative, and others labile (White 1973) . For instance, a group of more than 10,000 acridoid grasshopper species is dominantly of a single karyotype with 23 one-armed (acrocentric) chromosomes (White 1973) . A clade of about 500 salamander species in six families has mostly biarmed (metacentric or submetacentric) chromosomes and stable numbers (Sessions 2008) . In the carabid beetle genus Bembidion with more than 1000 species, almost all autosomes are biarmed, and 190 of the 205 species studied have 11 pairs of autosomes (D. Maddison 1985) . In contrast, other clades show many evolutionary changes, such as the morabine grasshoppers with 11 or more origins of neo-Y chromosomes (White 1969) .",

White (1973, p. 671 ) proposed a constraint to explain the observation that most spiders, and almost all spiders of the large and familiar entelegyne clade, have acrocentric chromosomes and an X 1 X 2 0 male/X 1 X 1 X 2 X 2 female or related sex chromosome system (Araujo et al. 2005 (Araujo et al. , 2012 Kr\u00e1l et al. 2006) . Rare in this clade are species with biarmed chromosomes and unknown to White were species with neo-Y chromosomes from X-autosome fusions. White noted that in spiders the crossing over points between the chromosomes of a pair tend to be placed close to the centromere (proximal chiasma localization). He argued that this constrains against the evolution of chromosome fusions that might generate metacentrics or neo-Y chromosomes.",

            "text": "White's proposed constraint is illustrated in Figure 1 , which shows how proximal versus distal chiasmata would appear in a complex fused system. The example used is the X 1 X 2 X 3 Y system of four sex chromosomes found by Maddison (1982) in Habronattus, the subject of this article. The X 2 and X 3 are paired with the Y whereas the X 1 is to the side (and not relevant to the constraint). As with most spiders, there is a single chiasma in each pairing chromosome arm (White 1973, p. 671) . To generate gametes properly, the Y must go to one pole at meiosis, the three Xs to the opposite pole. White (1973, p. 295) notes that for the highest probability of proper disjunction, the centromeres of such a three-chromosome system (focusing on the linked X 2 , X 3 , and Y) need to arrange themselves into an isosceles triangle. In Figure 1A , the paired chromosomes are connected via chiasmata far from the centromere (i.e., distal), giving the chromosomes considerable space and allowing for them to easily achieve the regular arrangement. In Figure 1B , the chiasmata are close to the centromere, making a tightly paired configuration whose mechanical crowding could prevent the regular arrangement. White argues that chromosomes could often go to the incorrect pole, yielding aneuploid gametes and reduced fertility, and thus hindering the establishment of such complex fused systems in spiders, which generally have chiasmata like that of Figure 1B . In this way, White (1973) explained the lack of neo-Y systems observed in spiders.",

In Habronattus, Maddison (1982) found four species with X 1 X 2 X 3 Y sex chromosomes in three different species groups, hinting at the possibility of multiple origins via X-autosome fusion. Using phylogenetic information on Habronattus (Maddison and Hedin 2003) , we can therefore examine sex chromosome evolution and chiasma localization in the group to test White's constraint hypothesis by asking: are there multiple origins of neo-Y systems in Habronattus, and do these origins appear to be associated with a lack of the localization constraint?

Therefore, except where the chiasma is fully distal, there is a point, along the length from the centromere to the tips, at which the chromosome bends. This is taken as the point of the chiasma. The lengths of the chromosome segments between centromere and bend, and between bend and tip, were measured. Chiasma position was calculated as (length centromere to bend)/(total length). Measurements were taken either along the interior or along the exterior of the chromosome arms, depending on the picture's clarity. The ratios of the measurements for each of the four chromatids were averaged to determine the chiasma position for the whole chromosome bivalent. If no bend could be identified because the chiasma position was extreme, the position was determined to be proximal (0.0) or distal (1.0), depending on the bivalent's orientation relative to the spindle.

Tests were done in both directions, with chiasma localization predicting neo-Y presence, and with neo-Y presence predicting chiasma localization. First, median or mean chiasma localization was treated as the predictor, and the response variable was the sex chromosome system, recorded as a binary variable (neo-Y chromosome present vs. absent). For this test, we used a binomial GLMM with a logit link function, run as follows:",

It asks whether evolutionary origins of Y chromosomes are more concentrated than expected by chance in regions of the phylogeny with distal localization. As this test requires two binary variables, chiasma localization was discretized by coding as 1 ( = distally localized) those taxa with median chiasma position 0.8 or over, those below as 0. This threshold matches a gap in the distribution of chiasma localization among species (Fig. S1 ). The test was applied using Mac-Clade 4.08 with the BEAST tree, and with discretized chiasma localization as the independent variable and the presence of neo-Y as the dependent.

First, the X 1 and the proximal half of the X 2 in X 1 X 2 Y and X 1 X 2 X 3 Y systems show the metaphase behavior of ancestral X material, because they lie side by side without chiasmata, and because they appear less condensed (heteropycnotic) than the autosomes (e.g., Fig. 3D )-as do the X 1 and X 2 in X 1 X 2 0 species. In contrast, the distal half of the X 2 , all of the X 3 , and the Y of X 1 X 2 Y and X 1 X 2 X 3 Y systems behave like the autosomes in pairing and in condensation patterns. Second, with the exception of Habronattus banksi and Habronattus pochetecanus, X 1 X 2 Y species have 12 pairs of acrocentric autosomes and X 1 X 2 X 3 Y have 11 pairs. A simple model (Fig. 3E ) explaining this is that the modified X 2 (in X 1 X 2 Y and X 1 X 2 X 3 Y species) represents a tandem fusion between an ancestral X and an autosome, with each portion retaining its ancestral behavior. The autosome's homologous partner therefore became the Y, and the number of uninvolved autosomes was reduced from 13 to 12 pairs. In X 1 X 2 X 3 Y species the Y would, in addition, have had a centric fusion with a second autosome to become biarmed, and this second autosome's homologous partner became the X 3 , further reducing the number of uninvolved autosomes from 12 to 11 pairs. This evolutionary model implies an ordered sequence: one step from X 1 X 2 0 to X 1 X 2 Y and one step from X 1 X 2 Y to X 1 X 2 X 3 Y (Fig. 3E) .",

This is consistent with the widespread occurrence of X 1 X 2 0 system in salticids and other spiders (Araujo et al. 2005 (Araujo et al. , 2012 Kr\u00e1l et al. 2006 ). The Mk1 likelihood reconstruction on the BEAST tree (Fig. 4A ) shows X 1 X 2 0 on most internal nodes, with X 1 X 2 Y or X 1 X 2 X 3 Y systems evolving independently 13 times, six of which are in the viridipes and coecatus groups. The Mk1Ordered reconstruction is nearly the same, except that ambiguity in the viridipes group suggests as an alternative a single origin of Y (via X 1 X 2 Y) within the group (Fig.  4A, inset) . If H. cf. paratus (Sucumbios), not included because of lack of molecular data, were included on this tree in its presumed location as sister to H. paratus, the number of origins of neo-Y systems would rise to 14. Similarly, inclusion of the northern X 1 X 2 X 3 Y population of H. cuspidatus would likely raise the number of origins to 15. The apparent phylogenetic misplacement of H. notialis, H. jucundus and H. calcaratus calcaratus has little effect on our results, as this introduced no false origins of neo-Y (all have X 1 X 2 0) and none of these species were measured for chiasma localization.",

Such short branches are highly problematic for subsequent analyses such as ancestral state reconstructions: we do not trust the branches, and yet if the clade is variable, they may imply homoplasy and force the interpretation of high rates of change.

Because the transition from X 1 X 2 0 to X 1 X 2 Y involves a gain of a Y as well as a reduction in autosome number, reversion to X 1 X 2 0 would require the X 2 be dissociated at the old X-autosome boundary and a centromere reconstituted, so as to recover the extra autosome pair.

This and the phylogenetic distribution of neo-Ys in many isolated species (Fig. 4) are consistent with recent origins. Three clades, however, have multiple species that share an apparently homologous Y chromosome: the H. dorotheae group (2 species, Habronattus geronimoi and H. sp.

The localization across all autosomes suggests there was an evolutionary change that affected all chromosomes, as found also by Colombo (1989) . In this regard, our data differ from those of Bidau et al. (2001) , who found that distal localization was confined to those chromosomes involved in the fusions.

In our data, this requires deletion of 15 neo-Y taxa and the fictitious assignment of a Y to H. tarascanus, H. texanus, H. pugillis, H. orbus, H. virgulatus, and Habronattus pyrrithrix.

However, his mechanistic explanation of segregation problems is inapplicable to X 1 X 2 Y systems. He argues that proper segregation is best served by a regular triangular arrangement of centromeres, but X 1 X 2 Y can have no such triangular arrangement, because the two Xs pair and go to the same pole.

The lifting of White's segregation constraint should permit fusions in general, including autosome-autosome fusions. We reconstructed at least 8-15 origins or losses of neo-Y, probably mostly origins, involving X-autosome fusions. In contrast there was at most one hint of a simple autosome-autosome fusion (in H. banksi and H. pochetecanus), and one hint of an X-X fusion (in H. tarascanus and H. sp. [YESOS] ). With 13 pairs of autosomes and only two X chromosomes, the probability that random fusions would all or mostly involve X chromosomes is small. There are several independent cases of fusion of autosomes to ancestral autosomal material-the second autosome-Y fusion to go from X 1 X 2 Y to X 1 X 2 X 3 Y (Fig. 3E )-but in each of these cases the autosome fused to autosomal material that was already bound to the sex chromosomes.

The second fusion of an autosome, to the neo-Y generated by the first fusion, would be particularly prone to selection under intralocus sexual conflict (Charlesworth and Charlesworth 1980) . Intersexual conflict could be particularly strong in these species groups, provoking both maximal courtship complexity and maximal sex linkage.",

Within H. cuspidatus, the northern X 1 X 2 X 3 Y population is not notably different in courtship ornaments from the southern X 1 X 2 0 population. If X-autosome fusions are promoted by new sex-linked traits, it is possible that these traits are hidden among the many others that are not linked to sex chromosomes, or it is possible that the sex-linked traits concern the less-studied female responses.",

A direct and immediate mechanical response to shift chiasmata after a fusion occurs cannot explain why chiasmata are shifted on autosomes uninvolved in the fusion. White's constraint-lifting hypothesis and the accommodation hypothesis are relatively minor variants on one another, as they differ in evolutionary sequence but share the basic mechanism of segregation problems constraining against proximal chiasma localization in neo-Y species. The fourth hy-pothesis, involving intralocus sexual conflict, suggests that chiasmata shift distally to limit recombination in neo-Ys with sexually antagonistic loci.",

Intersexual conflict may also explain the coincidence of these fusions in Habronattus, a group with remarkably diverse and complex courtship behavior, but this is only a single data point phylogenetically. However, White's segregation constraint hypothesis may explain why spiders apart from Habronattus show so few neo-Y chromosomes, which after all might be expected to happen occasionally even without strong intralocus sexual conflict. It is therefore possible that both sexual antagonism and segregation constraints were involved. Successful establishment of X-autosome fusions, selected by intralocus sexual conflict, may have been more likely in species that had already evolved some distal localization, as this would avoid segregation problems and facilitate the isolation of alleles on the Y. Alternatively or in addition, distal localization could have been strengthened after a selected fusion to improve both segregation and isolation of alleles.",

This suggests that if distal localization were the result of selection on chiasmata on the Y, the mechanism by which it was achieved was not localized to the Y. One implication of this is that the attendant reduction in recombination occurs in the autosomes as well. Thus, sex chromosome evolution may broadly restructure linkage in male Habronattus.",

Maddison assisted with collecting specimens and did some of the chromosome preparations. Tila M. P\u00e9rez helped to obtain Mexican permits and specimens, which were collected with the assistance of M. Hedin, J. L. Castelo, F. Alvarez, and R. Ayala. R. Maia helped considerably in helping us navigate MCMCglmm. We received helpful comments on the manuscript from G. Blackburn, J. Zhang, E. Piascik, and two anonymous reviewers.
