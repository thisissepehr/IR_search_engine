Methods: Using emergency claims data, we identified significant deviations in emergency department use after Hurricane Sandy. Using time-series analysis, we analyzed the frequency of visits for specific conditions and comorbidities to identify medically vulnerable populations who developed acute postdisaster medical needs. Results: We found statistically significant decreases in overall post-Sandy emergency department use in New York City but increased utilization in the most vulnerable evacuation zone. In addition to dialysisand ventilator-dependent patients, we identified that patients who were elderly or homeless or who had diabetes, dementia, cardiac conditions, limitations in mobility, or drug dependence were more likely to visit emergency departments after Hurricane Sandy. Furthermore, patients were more likely to develop drug-resistant infections, require isolation, and present for hypothermia, environmental exposures, or administrative reasons. Conclusions: Our study identified high-risk populations who developed acute medical and social needs in specific geographic areas after Hurricane Sandy. Our findings can inform coherent and targeted responses to disasters. Early identification of medically vulnerable populations can help to map \"hot spots\" requiring additional medical and social attention and prioritize resources for areas most impacted by disasters.

They are often disproportionately challenged by disasters owing to complex chronic disease and lack of transportation, social support, or financial means. 5, 6 Following Hurricane Sandy, New York City acknowledged the need to address medically vulnerable populations in its post-Sandy assessment report. Specific recommendations included the creation of a \"vulnerable populations and homebound door-to-door service and action plan\" to improve outreach to these populations and ensure critical access to health care services, medicines, and medical supplies. 7 Previous work has identified that patients with endstage renal disease who lose access to their dialysis centers suffer severe consequences during a disaster. 8 Ventilator-dependent patients may develop respiratory failure without electricity to run their devices. 9, 10 Anticipating these medical needs can prevent the medical complications that can develop in the early days after a disaster. Dialysis-dependent patients can be dialyzed in advance of an approaching hurricane. 11 Generators can be delivered to shelters in areas where residents are known to require ventilators. 12 With the development of new geographic methods to identify the location of patients with chronic disease, administrative data sets can be used to identify the geographic distribution of vulnerable populations at risk for developing acute medical needs during a disaster. 13, 14 Identifying the types of post-disaster medical needs that arise is a critical first step in preparing to address these needs in the wake of a disaster. 15 But first we need a more complete understanding of the other types of patients who are likely to require acute medical care after a disaster. 16 The goal of this study was to understand the geographic distribution of emergency department (ED) use after a disaster. 17 We used data before and after Hurricane Sandy's landfall to contrast ED utilization in the different administrative evacuation zones in New York City. 18, 19 We also performed a time-series analysis to identify the post-disaster acute medical needs that developed in different geographic regions.
