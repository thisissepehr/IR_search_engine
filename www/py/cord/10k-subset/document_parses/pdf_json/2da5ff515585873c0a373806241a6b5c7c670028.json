Current concepts relate such influences to the capacity of class I1 molecules to present relevant peptides to autoreactiveT cells. We have here analyzed the MHC influence on the immune response and the development of EAE after immunization with the immunodominant peptide MBP-63-88. Analysis of MHC-congenic LEWIS strains showed that RTla, RTIC and RT1' haplotypes are permissive for disease induction, whereas RTld and RTIU are resistant. All EAE responding strains showed peptide-specific proliferation and interferon (1FN)-y secretion, but no early significant tendency to express interleukin (IL-4) or transforming growth factor (TGF)-P mRNA in lymphocytes in response to the MBP 63-88, 7 days post immunization ( p i ) . Later, 14 days p.i., peptide-specific induction of IL-4 and TGF-p occurred in RT1' rats. Among the EAE non-responders strains, only the RTIU rats showed an immune response to MBP 63-88. This response, however, was qualitatively different from the immune response in the EAE-susceptible strains. Thus, there was no proliferation and only moderate IFN-y production in response to peptide, but in contrast, a significant and early peptide-induced IL-4 and TGF-f3 response was observed.The data suggest that the MHC-associated susceptibility to EAE is partly related to the ability to mount a TH1-like immune response while the MHC-associated EAE resistance may either be related to MBP peptide non-responsiveness or to peptide recognition and induction of a qualitatively different and disease down-regulatory immune response. en (Fax: + 46 8 7 74 48 22) Abbreviations: MBP: Myelin basic protein TGF-fi: Transforming growth factor @", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) in which CD4+ Tcells recognizing myelin proteins e.g. myelin basic protein (MBP) are crucial for disease induction [ 11.

In the LEWIS strain the MBP 63-88 peptide bound to the B (corresponding to DQ) class11 molecules is preferentially recognized after immunization [I 117511 with rat or guinea pig MBP .

In addition, it is not yet clarified which RT1 haplotypes permit responses to the immunodominant MBP 63-88 and whether such immune responses lead to disease or not. Susceptibility to disease after immunization with an immunodominant self peptide may be directly related to its capacity to bind to the MHC class I1 molecule in question leading to activation of pathogenic T cells. However, it is also possible that different class 11 molecules, upon binding to the peptide, trigger T cell activation of different quality, i.e. the responding T cell may produce different sets of cytokines.The functional division of T helper cells intoTHl cells producing IL-2, IFN-y and lymphotoxin and TH2 cells producing IL-4, IL-5 and IL-6 [8] has boosted the interest in this area. During certain infections, preferential recruitment of either subset is genetically regulated and has profound influence on the outcome of the infection [9] . A direct role of the MHC class11 genes to determine the outcome of cytokine secretion TH1 or TH2 pattern in the T cell response has earlier been demonstrated for the recognition of a type IV collagen peptide [lo] . In EAE there are several lines of evidence suggesting that IFNy-producing T cells promote disease development (for reviews see [ l l , 121) whereas IL-4-and TGF-fkproducing T cells have no or possibly a down-regulating role [13-151. It has recently been shown that cloned MBP-reactive TH1 cells but not TH2 cells transfer disease [15] . EAE downregulatory properties of certain cytokines have been suggested from experiments in which CD4+ Tcells could suppress IFN-y producing effector T cells by producing IL-4 and TGF-fi in a class 11-restricted fashion [16, 171. To specifically address the MHC association of disease susceptibility and the relevance for a possible MHC association of the cytokine pattern of the T cell response we have analyzed a series of MHC congenic LEWIS strains with the immunodominant MBP 63-88 peptide.

The importance of MHC could be confirmed by the finding that three (with class I1 haplotypes a, c and 1) out of seven investigated congenic strains were susceptible to disease induction. Our results partly confirm previous findings obtained after immunization of LEWIS congenic strains with guinea pig spinal cord homogenate; where only LEWIS (RT1') developed clinical disease while strains with a, f, d and u were resistant [6] . In other studies it has been shown that DA rats are highly susceptible to EAE induced with guinea pig spinal cord homogenate or with MBP showing that class I1 genes of the a allele are permissive for disease induction although in this strain other background genes are also of great importance [5] . Thus the present peptide show that the permissiveness by the a haplotype is related to its ability to recognize this immunodominant peptide. It should be emphasized that from the present, or previous, results it is not possible to conclude that the class11 genes are responsible for the observed MHC association. Circumstantial evidence is, however, supportive since the disease is Tcell-mediated and since the pathogenicT cells in the LEWIS strain recognized the MBP 63-88 peptide in the context of the MHC class11 B molecules (corresponds to the DQ molecule) [29] . It remains to be investigated whether the B molecule is also used in the a and c haplotype rats, which where here found to be susceptible. It has recently been shown that the B1 and Ba molecules display considerable differences [30] but that the class I1 molecules of a and c are relatively similar. Thus, Da and DC share the first domains while the Ba and the BC first domains differ only in the Bg chain [31] . In addition it has been reported earlier that class 11-restricted T cells from rats with RTIC, in similarity with RT1' rats, recognize the MBP 63-88 peptide in an immunodominant fashion [32] . From these considerations we conclude that in all three EAE-susceptible haplotypes (a, 1 and c) a class 11-restricted T cell activation in response to the MBP 63-88 peptide occurred.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 585, "end": 588, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 885, "end": 888, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1452, "end": 1456, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1687, "end": 1691, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1865, "end": 1869, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2058, "end": 2062, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Since IFN-y was produced by T cells from haplotypes a, 1 and c, the claim that the pathogenicT cells predominantly exert TH1-like activity is supported [ l l , 15,221. However, among the responder strains, the magnitude of disease did not correlate with the number of IFN-y-producing cells; cells from RTIC showed a more vigorous MBP 63-88 induced IFN-y production than cells from RTla and RTl', despite the fact that the former strain had a milder disease course than the two latter. The reason(s) for this are unclear, but it is possible that more extended studies might reveal an MHC-directed influence on production of other putative disease up-or down-regulatory cytokines such as lymphotoxin or IL-10.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Among the EAE-resistant strains we found that rats with RTld did not mount an immune response to MBP 63-88.

Of the used strains only LEWl . W showed an IL-4 and TGF-fi response as early as 7 days after immunization. It is tempting to suggest that this obviously MHC-regulated feature of the immune response might be causally related to the absence of clinical EAE. Recent results from other groups supports this interpretation. Direct treatment of rats with TGF-p counteracts EAE and IL-Zmediated proliferation [33] . After recovery of EAE in LEWIS rats CD4+ cells has been isolated, which secretes IL-4 and TGF-fi and suppress IFN-y mediated effects [17] . These data could explain the limitations of the disease course in the LEWIS rats and is compatible with our observation that the peptide-specific response with IL-4 and TGF-fi production tends to increase later in the immune response. A new finding is that the LEW1.W strain may recognize the MBP 63-88 peptide in a way which triggers an early Tcell expression of IL-4 and TGF-fi mRNA, instead of mounting a pure TH1 type response. A close-to-hand explanation is that the peptide may be bound to class I1 molecule of the u haplotype in a different way as compared to binding in haplotypes susceptible to EAE. A different affinity, or different processing requirements, may for instance lead to a presentation of the peptide predominantly by B cells, instead of macrophage or dendritic cells leading to another type of T cell response. A role for the antigen-presenting effects by B cells is supported by recent experiments in which tolerization to EAE was achieved by specifically addressing the MBP 63-88 peptide to B cells in vivo by usage of an anti4 conjugate [34] . Moreover, an MHC influence on the quality of the T cell response has been described for the response to a peptide of type IV collagen in the mouse and in this case this influence has been located to the peptide and MHC class I1 molecule complex [ 10,351. The present observation is the first made of such a phenomenon in the regulation of an autoimmune disease and adds a new way how MHC association to autoimmune disease may operate.The observed skewing of the immune response in the LEW1.W strain towards IL-4 and TGF-p production may not necessarily, however, be attributed to the class I1 molecule. It has earlier been postulated that the induction of oral tolerance in rats is mediated by CD8+ T cells secreting TGF-P locally in the inflammatory region [13] . This would imply a role for class I molecules. This is also compatible with our observations since we have not formally excluded a role either of polymorphism in the MHC class I region, o r of other putatively important polymorphic genes within h4HC.This will be studied by use of F1 hybrids, MHC-recombinant strains and with MHC class I1 transgenic rats.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 460, "end": 464, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 600, "end": 604, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1671, "end": 1675, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2436, "end": 2440, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion we have in the present communication defined MHC association for EAE induced with the major immunogenic peptide MBP 63-88.

Aliquots 200p1 of LNC suspensions from individual rats of the different strains were plated in round-bottom microtiter plates at a density of 5 x lo6 LNC/ml medium. Separate cultures either received no stimulus, 10-pl aliquots of Con A (5 pg/ml) or MBP 63-88 (lOpg/ml). We have previously shown that 24 h is an optimal stimulation time for these cytokines[24]. Thus, after 24-h incubation, cells were washed in PBS and lo5 MNC from each culture were dried onto restricted areas of microscope slides (Probe On, Fisher, Scientific, Pittsbugh, PA) at room temperature. In situ hybridization was performed essentially as described by Dagerlind et al.[25], with 35S-labeled synthetic oligonucleotide probes (Scandinavian Gene Synthesis AB, Koping, Sweden). The labeling was performed with [35S]deoxyadenosine 5'-a-thiotriphosphate (New England Nuclear, USA) with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Amersham). Typically, for each cytokine, a mixture of four different oligonucleotide probes was employed in order to increase the sensitivity of the method. The oligonucleotide was obtained from GenBank through the use of the MacVector system. The rat IFN-y probes (GenBank acces-The TGF-f3 probes (GenBank accession number X02812,[28]) were complementary to base 1363-1410,1457-1504, 1766-1813 and 1953-2000. Control slides were hybridized with the same total amount of radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe 891 anti-sense nucleotide sequence for rat IFN-y exon 4. A constant ratio of the GC content of approximately 60% was employed. The oligonucleotide probes were approximately 48 bases long and checked for the absence of palindromes and long sequences of homology within the species against available GenBank data. After emulsion autoradiography, slides were coded, cells expressing numerous grains over their cytoplasm were counted by dark field microscopy and the results expressed as number of labeled cells per lo5 plated cells.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "MHC haplotypes of LEWIS congenic rat strain useda) and susceptibility to EAE induced by MBP 63-88b)", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>Strain </td><td>B </td><td>RT1 D </td><td>Clinical incidence </td><td>Mean maximum severity </td><td>Mean histological score day 14 </td></tr><tr><td>LEW1.A </td><td>a </td><td>a </td><td>1w10 </td><td>3.2 f: 0.4 </td><td>+++ </td></tr><tr><td>LEW1.C </td><td>c </td><td>a </td><td>719 </td><td>1.2 k 0.8 </td><td>+(+) </td></tr><tr><td>LEW1.
