Firstly, because the statistic data about infectious disease is collected by day, week, month, or year, so it is more direct, more convenient and more accurate to describe the epidemic by using discrete-time models than continuous-time models. Secondly, it is very difficult to solve a nonlinear differential equation with a given initial condition to obtain the exact solution. Thus, for many practical requirements, such as numerical calculation, it is often necessary to discretize a continuous model into the corresponding discrete model. Therefore, we see that the discrete-time analog is also alike important for studying coupled system (1) .
