The measles virus nucleoprotein consists of a structured N-terminal domain, and of an intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain, N TAIL (aa 401-525), which undergoes induced folding in the presence of the C-terminal domain (XD, aa 459-507) of the viral phosphoprotein. Within N TAIL , an a-helical molecular recognition element (a-MoRE, aa 488-499) involved in binding to P and in induced folding was identified and then observed in the crystal structure of XD. Using small-angle X-ray scattering, we have derived a low-resolution structural model of the complex between XD and N TAIL , which shows that most of N TAIL remains disordered in the complex despite P-induced folding within the a-MoRE. The model consists of an extended shape accommodating the multiple conformations adopted by the disordered N-terminal region of N TAIL , and of a bulky globular region, corresponding to XD and to the C terminus of N TAIL (aa 486-525). Using surface plasmon resonance, circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy, and heteronuclear magnetic resonance, we show that N TAIL has an additional site (aa 517-525) involved in binding to XD but not in the unstructured-to-structured transition.

Using a combination of computational and biochemical approaches, we have identified within N TAIL an a-helical molecular recognition element (a-MoRE, aa 488-499) involved in binding to P and in the induced folding of N TAIL (Bourhis et al. 2004) . The a-MoRE has been modeled in the crystal structure of XD, in the long hydrophobic cleft delimited by helices a2 and a3 ). In this model, the contact of N TAIL with a hydrophobic patch at the surface of XD would be the driving force in the induced folding of the a-MoRE of N TAIL by burying apolar residues at the protein-protein interface. Very recently, Kingston et al. (2004a) have reported the crystal structure of a chimeric protein composed of MV XD and a peptide corresponding to residues 486-505 of MV N.

Several independent runs yielded different shapes with recurrent features: they were all elongated, with a globular cluster of always the same size at one extremity and an elongated protuberance with varying bends and cross-sections. The quality of the fit to the experimental data was similar in all cases, with a 2 of 1.3 to 1.6. The globular part most probably corresponds to XD packed against the folded region of N TAIL , while the outgrowth corresponds to unfolded regions of the latter. The crystal structure of the XD-N TAIL486-505 complex (PDB code 1T6O), which encompasses the a-MoRE (residues 488-499), was inserted in the shape using the program SUPCOMB (Kozin and Svergun 2001) (Fig. 2B ). Interestingly, only one protuberance was observed, corresponding to the N-terminal area of N TAIL , and no other protuberance was restored from the shape determination in the opposite region of the globular cluster, thus suggesting that the C-terminal region of N TAIL (aa 506-525), although not visible per se, is packed inside the bulky portion of the complex (Fig. 2B ). In order to get further insights into the conformation that the regions of N TAIL encompassing residues 401-485 and 506-525 adopt in the complex with XD, we used the program package CREDO, which is an extension of GASBOR and calculates the position of missing loops in crystal structures. The results obtained with several independent runs using the crystal structure of XD-N TAIL486-505 as the template, revealed at one side a peptide chain in an extended conformation and at the other side a chain packed against the bulky portion of the XD-N TAIL486-505 complex. The extended conformation, which protrudes from the globular cluster of the complex and points to the solvent, corresponds to the 92-residue-long N-terminal region of the N TAILHN construct. In contrast, the more compact peptide chain, corresponding to the 20-residue-long C-terminal region of N TAIL (aa 506-525), always packs against the XD-N TAIL486-505 complex but at varying distances and positions. An example of one of the calculated conformations is shown in Figure 2C . The experimental data were fitted by these models with similar 2 of about 0.8-1.0 (see Fig. 2C , inset). The various possible conformations provided by the program CREDO together with the extended structural properties of the complex (as indicated by the distance distribution function, the R g and the restored shape, with respect to the number of amino acids of the complex) are typical of disordered polypeptide chains lacking a stable regular structure. Accordingly, the structure shown in Figure 2C represents only one possible conformation found by CREDO among many others. Indeed, CREDO restores only one conformation per run, and therefore cannot account for multiple conformations due to disorder when fitting the data. Therefore, although a unique conformation of the N TAIL region encompassing residues 506-525 cannot be derived, all the solutions provided by CREDO consistently revealed a packing of the Cterminal region of N TAIL against XD.

Thus, we have recorded CD spectra of N TAIL deletion proteins in the presence of increasing concentrations of TFE ( Fig. 4A -C).

After mixing N TAILHNFC with different molar excesses of XD, the observed CD spectra differed from the corresponding theoretical average curves calculated from the individual spectra. Since the theoretical average curves correspond to the spectra that would be expected if no structural variations occur, deviations from these curves indicate structural transitions. The results obtained in the presence of a threefold molar excess of XD indicate a random coil to a-helix transition, as judged by the much more pronounced minima at 208 nm and 222 nm, and by the higher ellipticity at 190 nm of the experimentally observed spectrum compared to the corresponding theoretical average curve (see Fig. 5A ).

Our data support a higher affinity between P and N, resulting in a stable P-N TAIL complex that would be predicted to hinder processive movement of P along the nucleocapsid template. In agreement with this prediction, Box3 has been shown to have an inhibitory role upon transcription and replication, as indicated by previous minireplicon experiments, where deletion of Box3 enhanced basal reporter gene expression (Zhang et al. 2002) . We can speculate that the transient nature of the N TAIL -XD interaction might be ensured by the possible intervention of cellular and/or viral cofactors. Indeed, the requirement for cellular or viral cofactors in both transcription and replication has been already documented in the case of measles (Vincent et al. 2002) , respiratory syncytial (Fearns and Collins 1999) , and Ebola viruses (Hartlieb et al. 2003) . These cofactors may serve as processivity or transcription elongation factors and could act by modulating the strength of the interaction between the polymerase complex and the nucleocapsid template. Such a mechanism may explain the stimulatory effect of hsp72 on MV transcription and genome replication, an effect mediated by Box3-hsp72 interaction (Zhang 2002) . In this capacity, hsp72 may neutralize the contribution of Box3 to a more stable complex between P and N TAIL , thereby promoting successive cycles of P binding and release that are essential to polymerase processivity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 207, "end": 230, "text": "Kingston et al.

The amphipathic helix aB of pKID interacts with a hydrophobic groove defined by helices a1 and a3 of the partner. The other pKID helix, aA, contacts a different face of the a3 helix. This mode of interaction is reminiscent of that occurring between N TAIL and XD.

However, binding of the same region of HIFa to an asparagine hydroxylase results in a highly extended conformation, which is required for the enzymatic activity of the latter.

Purified XD (1.4 mg/mL in acetate buffer at pH 5.5) was covalently bound to carboxy-methyl groups of CM5 sensor chips using amine-coupling chemistry (Biosensor AB, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The levels of immobilized XD were comprised between 180 and 225 RU (1000 RU equal a change in mass of 1 ng/mm 2 on the sensor surface) (Zhang et al. 2002) . Kinetic and equilibrium constants were calculated from global analysis of reactions with multiple analyte concentrations (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 mM). Reactions were performed at 25 C. Remaining flow channels on the sensor chip included a control for a nonspecific interaction with the sensor chip (i.e., activated/ blocked flow channel) and a control for nonspecific interactions with irrelevant protein targets (i.e., lactoferrin conjugated flow channel). Protein analytes were passed over the sensor chip in HBS-P buffer (0.01 M HEPES at pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.005% surfactant P-20) containing 2.5 mM magnesium acetate and 2.5 mM ATP. Sensorgrams plotted changes in surface plasmon resonance (measured in RU) as a function of time. Multiple sensorgrams representing various analyte concentrations were analyzed by using BIAevaluation 3.1 software. Background interaction of N TAIL proteins (i.e., analytes) with the sensor surfaces were measured on flow channels that were activated and subsequently blocked under buffer conditions used to immobilize XD. This background was subtracted from all binding curves (i.e., sensorgrams) prior to global analyses. Immobilized lactoferrin was used as a specificity control, and the resultant sensorgrams ruled out high affinity interactions between N TAIL constructs or peptides and this irrelevant protein ligand (data not shown). Global fitting of experimental data to well-characterized binding reactions was used to define reaction rate and equilibrium constants. Signal changes on the activated/ blocked control channel were subtracted from the peptide-XD and N TAIL protein-XD interactions using in-line reference and the subtracted sensorgrams were analyzed. Curves generated with serial analyte concentrations were applied globally to the 1:1 Langmuir binding model with or without correction for baseline drifting depending on baseline status. 2 and residual values were used to evaluate the quality of fit between experimental data and individual binding models. Plots of residuals indicate the difference between the experimental and reference data for each point in the fit. The 2 value represents the sum of squared differences between the experimental data and reference data at each point.
