Since publication of this review, the RADI-CAL study [11] , an observational study with patients with suspected or proven BSI, pneumonia, or sterile fluid and tissue infection in nine ICUs, showed that PCR/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry provides rapid pathogen identification with a sensitivity of 81%, specificity of 69%, and negative predictive value of 97% at 6 h from sample acquisition and that treatment could have been altered in up to 57% of patients. Further, Banerjee et al., in a prospective randomized controlled trial, studied 617 patients with positive blood cultures and stratified randomization into 3 arms: standard blood culture processing (control), rapid-multiplex PCR (rmPCR) reported with templated comments or rmPCR reported with templated comments and real-time audit and feedback of antimicrobial orders by an AST team [12] . Antibiotic de-escalation occurred 19 h faster in the rmPCR/ AST group than in controls, with almost a 25% reduction in broad-spectrum antibiotic days of therapy.",

Second, it must be recognized that for rapid tests to be most useful they should ideally be offered 24 h per day, 7 days a week. In the EVAM-ICA study, tests were not offered at weekends and were batched for daily runs. Whether many clinical laboratories could implement this test for provision of prompt results in the \"real world\" setting remains to be determined.
