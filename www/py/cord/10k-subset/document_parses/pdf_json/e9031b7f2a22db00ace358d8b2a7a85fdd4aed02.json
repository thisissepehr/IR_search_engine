Methods: Twelve critically ill pregnant and postpartum women were included in this retrospective observational study on the application of ECMO for the treatment of severe ARDS refractory to standard treatment. The study was conducted at seven tertiary hospitals in Australia and New Zealand. Results: Of the 12 patients treated with ECMO, 7 (58%) were pregnant and 5 (42%) were postpartum. Their median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 29 (26-33) years, 6 (50%) were obese. Two patients were initially treated with veno-arterial (VA) ECMO. All others received venovenous (VV) ECMO with one or two drainage cannulae. ECMO circuitrelated complications were rare, circuit change was needed in only two cases and there was no sudden circuit failure. On the other hand, bleeding was common, leading to relatively large volumes of packed red blood cell transfusion (median [IQR] volume transfused was 3,499 [1, 874 ] ml) and was the main cause of death (three cases). Eight (66%) patients survived to discharge and seven were ambulant, with normal oxygen saturations. The survival rate of infants whose mothers Introduction Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a method for supporting patients with severe adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) refractory to mechanical ventilation [1] [2] [3] . ECMO has been used in neonates and children with satisfactory outcomes [4, 5] . More recently, technical advances have enabled its safer application in adults [3, 6] . Among such adults, occasional patients have been supported with ECMO while pregnant or in the postpartum period. Such treatments have led to individual case reports only [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .
