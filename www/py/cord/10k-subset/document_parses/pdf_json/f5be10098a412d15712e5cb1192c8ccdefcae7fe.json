To effectively monitor, design, or intervene in such epidemic-like processes, there is a need to predict the speed of a particular contagion in a particular network, and to distinguish between nodes that are more likely to become infected sooner or later during an outbreak. Here, we study these quantities using a message-passing approach to derive simple and effective predictions that are validated against epidemic simulations on a variety of real-world networks with good agreement. In addition to individualized predictions for different nodes, we find an overall sudden transition from low density to almost full network saturation as the contagion progresses in time. Our theory is developed and explained in the setting of simple contagions on treelike networks, but we are also able to show how the method extends remarkably well to complex contagions and highly clustered networks.",

Progress of this devastating outbreak of bubonic plague was limited by 14th century travel networks to an average daily dispersion of approximately 1.5 km [1] . In frightening contrast, the recent Zika outbreak in South America was found to spread with an average daily dispersion of 42 km, rising as high as 634 km in the most densely populated parts of Brazil [2] . This extraordinary difference is indicative of a mobile society that is no longer rigidly bound by spatial structure, making the relevant notion of distance network based rather than geographic. Similarly, in the highly connected domain of social media, the spread of concepts, memes, and hashtags can be explosive. One recent empirical study of the dynamics of online rumour cascades-often reaching tens of thousands of users in a matter of days-made the worrying finding that false information spreads faster than true [3] . It takes little imagination to see how an understanding of propagation speeds in modern networks would have, in the digital case, great commercial and political benefit and, in the physical case, be invaluable in planning outbreak prevention, monitoring, and response.",

One approach to the problem of spreading speed is through numerical simulations (see, e.g., [8] ), which yield useful results on small scales but, for increasingly large complex networks, may prove slow and impractical. Alternative approximations have been made by considering only the most probable path between a given target node and the source [9] . It is known that this shortest-path approach can significantly overestimate the infection arrival times [10] , but to take into account all possible paths would soon be infeasible because their numbers typically grow exponentially with the number of vertices in the network. One promising idea is a conjectured connection between centrality measures and infection arrival time [11] , which so far has only been tested numerically.",

This technique has allowed for efficient characterization of the epidemic (percolation) threshold [13, 14] , and it gave rise to the new notion of non-backtracking centrality [15] . In [16, 17] , a message-passing approach was used to make individualized predictions for node responses to spreading processes, giving a physical interpretation of non-backtracking centrality as the probability for a node to appear in the percolating cluster.

We finish by observing that the time for the infection to spread through the bulk of the network is independent of network size, implying an almost instantaneous jump from a low to a high density of infection when time is properly scaled; a property that we show to be common to timeordered percolation in general.",

It is important to note that this result is derived from making a treelike assumption for the underlying network, and our calculation holds in the limit of the large distance from the source. In this sense, it describes the fastest spreading regime: the mid-outbreak phase of exponential growth. In practical applications, however, most networks of interest are not treelike; and finite size effects mean the infection is unlikely to be able fully accelerate to the stable regime we have calculated. Nonetheless, our result still provides high-quality predictions. Figure 2 demonstrates the effectiveness of this measure on a variety of real-world networks from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection (SNAP) [24] : many with heavy-tailed degree distributions and high clustering; Table S .

Included in Fig. 2 , the results for these networks show that our method performs better for higher rewiring probability, but is still very successful for highly clustered networks with low rewiring.",

One might expect the time delay \u03c4 to be scaled by the mean delay time; but, beyond this, it is difficult to discern from Eq. (6) how the shape of the distribution should affect the global speed of spread. To explore this aspect, we show in Fig. 3 the observed and predicted spreading speeds for Weibull distributed delays, interpolating between heavy tailed and Dirac distributed. Crucially, we find that the shape of the distribution of the transmission time has a substantial effect on the speed of spread in a network. If there is mass near zero, then delays are minimal due to the presence of extremely fast transmission routes. Conversely, if the transmission time is close to deterministic, then spreading is determined entirely by graph distance, meaning \u03c4 \u2248 1. In the Supplemental Material [18] , we prove that \u03c4 is always less than the mean delay time, with equality only for Diracdelta distributions.",

This result is important because it resolves the open question of exactly how network centrality measures may be used to estimate epidemic arrival time, and it provides a robust theoretical justification for the use of non-backtracking centrality (see Supplemental Material [18] for a comparison to other centrality measures). Going further, many realistic models of network contagion require the number of infected neighbors of a node to reach some threshold \u03b8 \u2265 1 before the infection is passed on. In the Supplemental Material [18] , we show how a variation of our theory, building on results from [33] , extends to these complex contagion models by considering the \u03b8-shortest temporal paths from a node. Remarkably, the log-linear relationship derived above continues to hold in this more complex setting, as illustrated in Fig. 4 . In addition to this visual demonstration, we present in Table I the Pearson correlation coefficients between log-non-backtracking centrality and the infection arrival time for various disease dynamics in various networks. These results show that our theory, which is physically justified and cheap to compute, provides excellent predictions of the relative delay between nodes in a wide variety of spreading processes.",

Analyzing the spreading front of the contagion probability, we derived Eq. (6), showing how network topology and infection dynamics affect speed via, respectively, the network percolation threshold and the Laplace transform of the transmission time law. Our theory also reveals in Eq. (7) a surprisingly simple relationship between contagion arrival times and the non-backtracking centrality of nodes. Finally, we have observed that these results imply that the spreading process in large networks undergoes an almost instantaneous expansion in their reach when time is properly scaled. The setting for our theoretical derivation has been that of simple epidemics spreading on large treelike networks. However, we have shown that the key results hold remarkably well for a broad class of networks, including those with high clustering, and for contagion models including non-Markov dynamics and complex threshold models. Further development of rigorous mathematical results for these models is a challenging problem worthy of considerable future efforts. Excitingly, our results suggest possible routes for the development of monitoring and intervention protocols for real-world contagions using message-passing methods. Progress in this direction may require the consideration of even more detailed models including temporally varying and multilayered networks: both promising avenues for future research.",
