Special attention is paid to the aptamers to proteins involved into pathogenesis of wide spread human diseases. These include aptamers to serine proteases, cytokines, influenza viral proteins, immune deficiency virus protein and nucleic acid binding proteins. High affinity and specific binding of aptamers to particular protein targets make them attractive as direct protein inhibitors. They can inhibit pathogenic proteins and data presented here demonstrate that the idea that nucleic acid aptamers can regulate (inhibit) activity of pro tein targets has been transformed from the stage of basic developments into the stage of realization of practical tasks.",

            "text": "During the last decade a significant break has been achieved in the use of basic knowledge on DNA in applied studies. The development of highly technolog ical analytic methods employing immobilized DNA is one of rapidly developing directions. The major achievement of microarray technology (i.e. DNA chips) consists in possibility of the use of various DNA libraries amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the development of sets of DNA sequences. Using hybridization these sets can rapidly analyze and compare sequences of thousands genes, their mutant forms, DNA polymorphism and to discover new genes. The second direction consists in the develop ment of irrational design of nucleic acids for studies of nucleic acid protein recognition. In 1990, two labs (the Gold and Szoztak Laboratories; USA) indepen dently developed the SELEX method (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential enrichment) [1, 2] . Using this method it is possible to isolate targeted nucleic acid molecules (aptamers) from the large set of individual molecules (more than 10 18 ) known as the combinatorial library. Aptamers are small single stranded DNA or RNA molecules of 40\u23af100 nucle otide residues in length with rather complex three dimensional structure. Such complex structure deter mines aptamer ability to bind various molecules including proteins. Thus, such complex process of biosynthesis of protein recognizing elements, antibod ies, which nature has been naturally creating for thou sands years, is now modeled in vitro.",

Such library contains 10 14 -10 15 variants of RNA molecules, which are folded in complex 3D structure. The library is incubated with a protein and RNA molecules bound to the protein target are separated from unbound RNA molecules. The bound RNA molecules are separated from proteins and then amplified by means of reverse transcriptase and PCR to obtain a new pool of mole cules with increased affinity. The procedure is usually repeated 10-15 times until maximal number of aptamers exhibiting affinity to the target will be clearly detectable in the enriched fraction. Aptamers are then cloned (usually into a bacterial vector) and sequenced. In the case of DNA the selection also begins with DNA library in which the randomized region is flanked by fixed sequences at 5' and 3' ends. To pro duce single stranded DNA molecules either asymmet ric PCR or one of primers carries a biotinylated tag, which helps to separate one DNA strand from another on streptavidin columns are used. Many reviews on detailed description of all steps of this method have been published to date [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] .

RNA ligands were named as aptamers by Ellington and Szoztak [2] . They also introduced a name of this method, SELEX. Now convincing evidence exists that aptamers are a new effective group of therapeutics, which may represent The scheme illustrating the SELEX method for preparation of DNA and RNA aptamers. An initial randomized DNA library is transformed into single stranded DNA (ssDNA) and then introduced into binding reaction with a protein, pre immo bilized onto a column. RNA is obtained by transcription of the initial library; the latter carries introduced promoter of T7 RNA polymerase. RNA molecules are also exposed for binding with the protein immobilized onto the column. After removal of unbound molecules, DNA/RNA molecules that bind to the immobilized protein are separated from this protein by phenol chlo roform treatment and then subjected to alcohol sedimentation. RNA molecules are used for cDNA preparation by means of reverse transcriptase. All resultant molecules are then transformed into double stranded DNA (dsDNA). In the case of DNA ssDNA prepared using asymmetric PCR is used again for repeated binding. RNA molecules are subjected for transcription and resultant molecules are used for binding with the immobilized protein. The selection includes 10\u23af15 rounds and this yields an enriched fraction of aptamers. The next step includes cloning into a plasmid vector and sequencing of resultant sequences. an important tool against many diseases. The drug Macugen has already been approved by US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) for the treatment of age related macular degeneration (AMD). Some aptamers are now in different stages of pre and clini cal trials [11, 12] .",

The proposed concept gave a unique possibility of aptamer regulation because it allows to control administration of an aptamer based drug in any clinical use.

Pos sibility of aptamer preparation for any class of biomol ecules allows to evaluate importance of their use and increases areas of their applications. Advantage of aptamers maintaining their activity in multicellular organisms significantly facilitates preclinical trials, saves time and reduces costs required for antibody preparation on animal models. Finally, design of an antidote that control aptamer activity possibly repre sents the most important contribution to the develop ment of nuclei acid therapy because it can control drug dosage and, thus, determine required safety.

The 5 round selection resulted in identification of aptamers forming a complex with thrombin, which was characterized by the K d values ranged from 25 to 200 nM. These aptamers were based on the 15 nucleotide sequence: dGGTTGGTGTG GTTGG (15TBA). The aptamer increased time required for clot formation from 25 to 170 s in vitro and from 25 to 43 s in human blood plasma. The 15TBA structure was investigated by means of NMR analysis, which included the study of 15TBA alone, in the complex with thrombin and the study of aptamer binding with the anion binding site of thrombin, exosite 1 [32] [33] [34] [35] . 15TBA forms a complex compact tertiary structure known as G quadruplex (Fig. 3 ).

Using the com plementary base pairing principle the second RNA oligonucleotide complementary to the 9.3t aptamer was created. After administration of the antidote nucleotide the anticoagulation activity of the anti FIXa aptamer changed in 10 min and this effect per sisted for over 5 hours [16] .

The aptamer A22 exhibited high binding activity and blocked agglutination of chicken red blood cells [66] .

The constructed 14 mer DNA aptamer containing a sequences for E2F binding was tested for inhibition of E2F activity [82] . In vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) stimulated by E2F the 14 mer oligonucleotide (ODN) inhibited VSMC proliferation and expression of the genes c myc and cdc2, controlling cell cycle, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). In vivo the 14 mer ODN was transfected to rats with experimental carotid injury and this markedly suppressed the fibrosis for mation compared with nontransfected arterial seg ments. Furthermore, this inhibition continued up to 8 weeks after a single transfection [81] . Transfer of an E2F decoy can therefore modulate gene expression and inhibit smooth muscle proliferation and vascular lesion formation in vivo. Using the SELEX method other aptamers to E2F were also prepared; they inhib ited DNA binding activity of this protein [82] .",

An initial randomized DNA library is transformed into single stranded DNA (ssDNA) and then introduced into binding reaction with a protein, pre immo bilized onto a column. RNA is obtained by transcription of the initial library; the latter carries introduced promoter of T7 RNA polymerase. RNA molecules are also exposed for binding with the protein immobilized onto the column. After removal of unbound molecules, DNA/RNA molecules that bind to the immobilized protein are separated from this protein by phenol chlo roform treatment and then subjected to alcohol sedimentation. RNA molecules are used for cDNA preparation by means of reverse transcriptase. All resultant molecules are then transformed into double stranded DNA (dsDNA). In the case of DNA ssDNA prepared using asymmetric PCR is used again for repeated binding. RNA molecules are subjected for transcription and resultant molecules are used for binding with the immobilized protein. The selection includes 10\u23af15 rounds and this yields an enriched fraction of aptamers. The next step includes cloning into a plasmid vector and sequencing of resultant sequences.",
