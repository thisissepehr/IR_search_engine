This poses the question why these patients have not been treated. It should be kept in mind that this is a retrospective study of data acquired during routine clinical practice, so the decision to provide or withhold acyclovir treatment was left entirely to the responsible attending physician. In these patients, given the lack of evidence at that time, detection of HSV replication in the respiratory tract was not considered clinically significant by our clinical staff.
