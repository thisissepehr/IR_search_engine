To investigate microbial diversity and quantity in the brain, the profile of infectious agents was examined in pathologically normal and abnormal brains from persons with HIV/AIDS [HIV] (n = 12), other disease controls [ODC] (n = 14) and in cerebral surgical resections for epilepsy [SURG] (n = 6). Deep sequencing of cerebral white matter-derived RNA from the HIV (n = 4) and ODC (n = 4) patients and SURG (n = 2) groups revealed bacterially-encoded 16 s RNA sequences in all brain specimens with a-proteobacteria representing over 70% of bacterial sequences while the other 30% of bacterial classes varied widely. Bacterial rRNA was detected in white matter glial cells by in situ hybridization and peptidoglycan immunoreactivity was also localized principally in glia in human brains. Analyses of amplified bacterial 16 s rRNA sequences disclosed that Proteobacteria was the principal bacterial phylum in all human brain samples with similar bacterial rRNA quantities in HIV and ODC groups despite increased host neuroimmune responses in the HIV group. Exogenous viruses including bacteriophage and human herpes viruses-4, -5 and -6 were detected variably in autopsied brains from both clinical groups. Brains from SIV-and SHIV-infected macaques displayed a profile of bacterial phyla also dominated by Proteobacteria but bacterial sequences were not detected in experimentally FIV-infected cat or RAG1 2/2 mouse brains. Intracerebral implantation of human brain homogenates into RAG1 2/2 mice revealed a preponderance of a-proteobacteria 16 s RNA sequences in the brains of recipient mice at 7 weeks post-implantation, which was abrogated by prior heat-treatment of the brain homogenate. Thus, a-proteobacteria represented the major bacterial component of the primate brain's microbiome regardless of underlying immune status, which could be transferred into na\u00efve hosts leading to microbial persistence in the brain.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The existence of commensal microbes that colonize organs within the human body has long been recognized and termed the microbiome [1, 2] . Once thought of as harmless tenants, it has become increasingly obvious that the microbiome is not comprised of passive passengers but of specific infectious agents that participate in shaping the metabolic and immune status of the host [3, 4] . The composition of the human microbiome at several body sites including skin, oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, nasopharyngeal passage and urogenital tract are subjects of intensive study [2, 5, 6, 7] , revealing both local effects at these sites but also systemic effects, including influencing inflammatory or metabolic functions in privileged organs such as the brain [8, 9, 10] . These latter studies have reported complex bacterial populations with wide variations in individual bacterial constituents at the species level, both in serially sampled humans and across groups of humans. The composition of the microbiome at the phylum level is consistent throughout the body with the exception of the skin, where diverse population structures occur at different sites [11, 12] . In most body sites sampled to date, Firmicutes and Bacteriodetes represent the dominant phyla with substantial numbers of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria detected, while other phyla comprise a small proportion of the remaining species. Importantly, body sites previously presumed to be sterile in healthy humans, such as the vascular endothelium, have been shown to be colonized without apparent signs of disease. In contrast, diseases such as biliary cirrhosis [13, 14] , atherosclerosis [15] and aortic aneurysms [16] , previously considered attributable to autoimmunity or pathogenic metabolites, are now hypothesized to be induced or exacerbated by infectious agents, possibly as part of local microbiomes Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection with the ensuing development of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a recognized cause of perturbation within microbiomes within the gut and other organs [17] . The altered immune status of HIV/AIDS patients is associated with qualitative and quantitative shifts in microbiome diversity and quantity as well as increasing the likelihood of microbial translocation from the gut to other organs [18] . These events occur because of reduced immune surveillance and damaged barrier function at epithelial and endothelial sites, including damage to the blood-brain barrier [19] . Multiple studies have shown the blood-brain barrier to be more permeable in HIV/ AIDS, implying this circumstance might contribute to HIVassociated neurological disease [20, 21] . Given the emerging appreciation of microbiome disruption together with the damage to the brain injury during HIV/AIDS, we hypothesized that brain tissue from patients with HIV/AIDS might contain greater microbial quantities and perhaps diversity, derived largely from other organs such as the gut, which has a wellestablished microbiome and altered function during HIV infection. In fact, the present studies showed that all examined human brains contained bacterially-expressed RNA and associated products together with a predominance of a-proteobacteria, regardless of the patients' immune status and concurrent diseases. Moreover, a similar bacterial population was observed in the brains of non-human primates. This microbial population found in the human brain could be transmitted into immunodeficient mice and subsequently recovered 7 weeks later suggesting the brain was tolerant to the presence of certain bacterial species", "cite_spans": [{"start": 130, "end": 133, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 134, "end": 136, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 376, "end": 379, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 380, "end": 382, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 576, "end": 579, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 580, "end": 582, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 583, "end": 585, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 586, "end": 588, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 759, "end": 762, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 763, "end": 765, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 766, "end": 769, "text": "10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1159, "end": 1163, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1164, "end": 1167, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1634, "end": 1638, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1639, "end": 1642, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1661, "end": 1665, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1687, "end": 1691, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2103, "end": 2107, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2342, "end": 2346, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2517, "end": 2521, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2693, "end": 2697, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2698, "end": 2701, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Massively parallel sequencing without prior amplification was performed using cDNA derived from total RNA that was extracted from autopsy-derived cerebral white matter of HIV/ AIDS (HIV) (n = 4: HIV1-4) and other disease control (ODC) (n = 4: ODC1-4) patients, as well as from white matter extracted from brain tissue collected during surgical (SURG) resections for epilepsy (n = 2: SURG 1-2) ( Table 1 ).

The most abundantly detected phylum in all samples was Proteobacteria, based on a patient-by-patient analysis ( Figure 1A) . Moreover, one of the dominant phyla in other organs (Firmicutes) was undetectable in most brain-derived RNA samples by this approach. The next most abundant phylum in most samples was Actinobacteria. The identities of minor bacterial constituents showed variation between different patients. Surgically-derived cerebral samples (SURG-1 and SURG-2) showed a similar predominance of Proteobacteria, but in contrast to the autopsy-derived specimens, Actinobacteria were not among the principal constituents ( Figure 1B ). The sequences mapping to members of the Proteobacteria phylum were examined at the class level, revealing that a-proteobacteria was the most frequently detected class of Proteobacteria in all brain samples ( Figure 1C ). In agreement with the distribution of bacteria in the present samples, the majority of bacteriophage sequences detected in autopsy-derived cerebral white matter specimens corresponded to Proteobacteria-tropic phage RNA ( Figure 1D ). Tags mapping to bacteriophage sequences were not identified in the surgicallyderived samples.

To explore abundance of viruses known to infect the brain in more detail, the presence of viral genomes was investigated in total RNA and genomic DNA from HIV and ODC white matter samples. Cytomegalovirus (HHV-5), HHV-6A/B and Epstein-Barr virus (HHV-4) sequences were variably present in specimens from both groups of autopsied samples but other DNA and RNA viruses were infrequently detected in HIV or ODC brain specimens (Table 3) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1740, "end": 1744, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 139, "end": 148, "text": "(Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 264, "end": 274, "text": "Figure 1A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 783, "end": 792, "text": "Figure 1B", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1004, "end": 1013, "text": "Figure 1C", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1238, "end": 1247, "text": "Figure 1D", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2171, "end": 2180, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Bacterial RNA Detection in Brain Tissue by Deep Sequencing"}, {"text": "As both bacterial and viral genomes were detected in the present brain specimens, we examined host genes known to participate in responses to infections.

Analysis of host genes germane to viral infections disclosed that antiviral genes such as mx1 and oas1 were induced in the HIV brains while MHC Class I genes (hla-c, -b and -a) were relatively suppressed in the same group ( Figure 2B ). Further analysis by real time RT-PCR showed that transcripts encoded by multiple genes implicated in host responses to viral infections of the brain were increased in the HIV/AIDS brains (HIV4, 7-10, n = 5)) with cd3e, egf and il-23 showing significant increases compared to ODC brains (ODC6-10, n = 5)) ( Figure 2C ).

The majority of the bacterial RNA sequences identified in all human and nonhuman primate brains were encoded by members of the a-proteobacteria class, regardless of the underlying disease process. This restricted bacterial diversity observed in normal brain tissues is in contrast to the findings of a wide variety of organisms from other groups studying brain abscesses [24, 25] ; many of which display colonization by bacteria from other tissues. This dichotomy in findings suggests that the bacteria identified in normal appearing tissue in the present studies might be are outcompeted and/or supplanted by organisms from other body sites in the case of intracerebral abscesses. Peptidoglycan immunoreactivity and in situ hybridization detection of bacterial rRNA were apparent within glial cells and in the extracellular space. In vivo cerebral implantation of human brain homogenates into mice showed that the 16 s RNA sequences recovered from recipient animals' brains were conserved and expressed at levels similar to the initial human brain homogenate. Transmission was interrupted by heat treatment of the initial homogenate, implying that viable bacteria were required for transmission. These findings indicated that bacteria were present in the primate brain and do not appear to be derived from the predominant populations at other human body sites. Indeed, the predominance of a-proteobacteria in the brain is unparalleled in other body sites where the microbiomes are dominated by Firmicutes, Bacteriodetes and Actinobacteria.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 646, "end": 650, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 651, "end": 654, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The bacterial rRNA V3-V4 region-based detection of aproteobacteria in the present studies was supported by the unbiased (non-amplified) deep sequencing.

There might also be a bias introduced by the PCR conditions, despite the use of universal primers, resulting in an over-representation of b-proteobacteria sequences. This finding needs to be clarified through culturing of brain specimens as part of future analyses to identify definitively the components of the primate brain's microbiome at the species level.

Controls for all lots of reagents were used throughout this work at all steps of the RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and conventional and quantitative RT-PCR. The current tissues varied in harvest times and sources; for example, autopsy times ranged from 12-24 hr, while surgical samples were collected under sterile conditions and immediately frozen on dry ice in the operating room. To confirm that 16 s rRNA amplicons identified were intrinsic to the tissue and not introduced during sample preparation RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and PCR, extensive reagent and equipment controls were used throughout these studies up to and including having the entire process repeated by different personnel in another facility using different lots of consumables and reagents ( Figure S3B ). White matter was intentionally selected to limit blood contamination of samples; additionally, bacterial genome and products were detected in brain parenchyma remote from blood vessels and within cells (glia) known to phagocytose foreign materials. Likewise, the current simian brain samples were harvested and processed by different investigators in a distant facility, yet the same phyla were predominant in the majority of macaque brains examined. Brain samples from experimental animals reared in SPF conditions with concurrent immunosuppression (RAG1 2/2 mice and FIV-infected cats) were included as controls within these studies but did not show bacterial 16 s rRNA sequences in brain despite being processed in an identical manner to the human and macaque brains, even with prior amplification steps and identical preparatory methods. Despite the diversity of techniques and sources of the present brain tissues, a-proteobacteria represented the most prevalent bacterial class discovered within the human brain, which was in contrast to blood samples. The consistency of a-proteobacteria detection in primate brains but not in SPF experimental animal brains emphasized the reliability and specificity of the present observations. Several of the bacterial classes observed in the present studies have been associated previously with human diseases. For example, an organism similar to many of the 16 s V8 region sequences, Delftia acidovorans has been implicated in endocarditis [27] , bacteremia [28, 29] , corneal keratitis [30] and urinary tract infections [31] . In addition to causing infections in compromised patients, D. acidovorans and other members of the Comamonadaceae have been identified as part of the bacterial community in the arterial wall in patients who have had aortic aneurysms [16] . D. acidovorans has also been isolated from cerebrospinal fluid, sputum, urine, pharynx and wounds without concurrent signs of disease [32] . Taken together, this ubiquitous environmental organism likely represents a commensal organism with wide tissue distribution that can act as an opportunistic pathogen in vulnerable patients. As such, the prevalence of sequences showing similarity to Delftia sp. in the majority of patients in all the present clinical groups bears close scrutiny as host specific factors might determine whether or not this organism contributes to brain disease. Two HIV/AIDS patients exhibited sequences similar to Alcaligenaceae; members of this family have been identified as components of the normal flora in Peyer's patches [33] , but members have also been implicated in endocarditis [34] , bacteremia [35, 36] and meningitis with or without ventriculitis in neonates [37, 38] , HIV-infected persons [39] , other immunocompromised adults [40] or following invasive surgery [41] . Thus, identifying members of this family may represent translocation of commensal gut organisms to the brain or a previously unidentified subclinical infection in these patients. time RT-PCR showed similar levels of mean 16 s rRNA amplicon quantities in HIV and ODC brain samples, however SURG samples showed lower amplicon levels of 16 s rRNA products.

The alignments were used to generate a neighbour joining tree using 10,000 bootstrap trials.

The brain is constantly surveyed by trafficking leukocytes (activated lymphocytes and macrophages), which provide a Trojan horse mechanism for microbial entry into the nervous system across the blood brain barrier. In fact, this mechanism is well recognized as a route by which viruses infect the brain and likely underlies the detection of herpes viruses in both the HIV and ODC brains. Corroborating this latter point is the report of peptidoglycan detection in brain lesions from multiple sclerosis patients, which are heavily infiltrated with blood-derived leukocytes [42] .

This amplicon was then used as a template with the primers 16s514F and 16s806R (Table S3) under identical cycling conditions with the exception that an annealing temperature of 56.5uC was used in place of 59uC. All reactions were run alongside a negative control reaction with 5 mL ultrapure H 2 O (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) added in place of template cDNA. Ten mL of each reaction were run on a 1.5% agarose gel impregnated with 4 mg/ml ethidium bromide for approximately 1 hr at 100V in TBE and visualized using an image quant 300 (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) gel dock. PCR products were excised and extracted using the Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). 16 s rRNA PCR products were subcloned into pGEM T-easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and propagated as per the manufacturer's instructions in Library efficiency DH5a cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Cells were then harvested and the plasmids were isolated using the GeneJET kit (Fermentas, Burlington, ON, Canada). Purified plasmid was quantified by nanodrop (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and sequenced in both directions using the T7 and M13R sequencing primers and the Big Dye Terminator 3.1 (ABI, Foster City, CA, USA) Cycle sequencing kit followed by analysis on an ABI 3730 DNA sequencer. Sequences were assembled from bi-directional reads and identified using the BLAST algorithm against the NCBI nucleotide database, in parallel with the RDP (Ribosomal Database project) classifier tool (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/). Nearest matches were then compared to the brain-derived sequences using the MCoffee alignment suite (http://tcoffee.crg.cat/) or the Clustal X algorithm alone. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor joining method with ten thousand bootstrap trials using alignments generated by both methods and including corresponding rRNA sequences from recognized species closely matching the amplified bacterial rRNA sequences. To investigate the presence of bacterially-encoded transcripts, primers targeting groEL [55] were used in a semi-quantitative RT-PCR using RT-PCR super mix (BioRAD, Hercules, CA, USA) with autopsy-derived white matter cDNA, surgically-derived white matter cDNA, PBMC-derived cDNA and serum-derived cDNA as templates using an annealing temperature of 56uC. Cycle thresholds were normalized to gapdh values from the same run.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 606, "end": 610, "text": "[45,", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 611, "end": 614, "text": "53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1022, "end": 1026, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 4002, "end": 4006, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 573, "end": 582, "text": "(Table S2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 1340, "end": 1350, "text": "(Table S3)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 1712, "end": 1721, "text": "(Table S3", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 2028, "end": 2038, "text": "(Table S3)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "cDNA Synthesis for PCR and Bacterial RNA Detection and Sequencing"}, {"text": "Detection of herpes viruses was performed by PCR using brainderived genomic DNA as template with Taqman probes and primers under published conditions (Table S4) [56, 57] .

Animals were maintained under group housing for 7 weeks then sacrificed and the brain collected from which RNA was extracted, as described above for the human samples. Figure S1 Network analyses of host gene expression in relation to bacterial quantity. The identified 75 host genes associated with bacterial quantity were subjected to network analyses generating a network (IPA score 21) emphasizing genes that participated principally in cell morphology, division and maintenance function, e.g. calreticulin, SLC12A, KLF1, netrin (NTN1). Red shading indicates a positive correlation and green shading indicates negative correlation. Thus, there was an apparent association between host genes implicated in essential brain maintenance and functions with bacterial quantity.
