Recent tobacco control programs have not closed the gap in disparities for African Americans. This poster see~s to pr~vide a theoretical framework for addressing the health inequities in tobacco among African Americans usmg the work of critical race theorists Richard Delgado and Kimberlie Crenshaw. Critical race theory has been used predominately in the legal and education arenas, but has broad implications for addressing health inequities that exist among African Americans. Applying critical race theory to tobacco use, the author will argue that: I) public health interventions should not exist in class bound areas; 2) that colorblind approaches to public health increase health disparities; and 3) public health interventions should be developed for specific communities of color. This poster will provide an overview of critical race theory, apply the theory to health, and provide implications for public health practitioners and clinicians within the tobacco control arena.",

In June of 2004, the San Francisco Food Alliance, a group of city agencies, community based organizations and residents, initiated a collahorarive indicator project called rhe San Francisco Food and Agriculture Assessment. In order to attend to root causes of food related illnesses and diseases, the purpose of the Assessment is to provide a holistic, systemic view of San Francisco\\\\'s food system with a focus on three main areas that have a profound affect on urban public health: food assistance, urban agriculture, and food retailing. Using participatory, consensus methods, the San Francisco Food Alliance jointly developed a sec of indicators to assess the state of the local food system and co set benchmarks for future analysis. Members collected data from various city and stare departments as well as community based organizations. Through the use of Geographic Information Systems software, a series of maps were created to illustrate the assets and limitations within the food system in different neighborhoods and throughout the City as a whole. This participatory assessment process illustrates how to more effectively attend to structural food systems issues in large urban areas by ( t) focusing on prevention rather than crisis management, (2) emphasizing collaboration to ensure institutional and structural changes, and (3) aptly translating data into meaningful community driven prevention activities.",

Both dt\u2022monstrate the importance of having support with the process and a health focus. Borrowing from traditions of \"Technical Aid\"\u2022 and community development the health promoter /planner has incorporated a range of \"determinants of health\" into neighbourhood planning discussions. As in most urban conditions the physical environment is linked to a range of health stressors such as social isolation, crowding, noise, lack of open space /recreation, mobility and safety. However typical planning processes do not hring in a health perspective. Health as a focus for neighbourhood planning is a powerful starti_ng point when discussing transportation planning or changing land-uses. By raising awareness on determmants of health, citizens can begin to better understand how to engage in a process and affect change.

However, engagement in a CBR process led to some important lessons and benefits for Street Health. We learned that the community involvement of homeless people and front-line staff is critical to ensuring relevance and validity for a research project; that existing strong relationships with community parmers are essential to the successful implementation of a project involving marginalized groups; and that an action approach focusing on positive change can make research relevant to directly affected people and community agency staff. Street Health benefited from using a CBR approach, as the research process facilitated capacity building among staff and within the organization as a whole.

Research has identified several issues that contribute to decreased access to primary health care for this population however racism has emerged as an overarching determinant of health and healthcare access. This is further amplified by simultaneous membership in multiple groups that experience discrimination and barriers to healthcare for example those affected by sexism, homelessness, poverty, homophobia and heterosexism, disability and HIV infection. The Collaborative Process to Achieve Access to Primary Health Care for Black Women and Women of Colour Project was developed with The University of Toronto Faculty of Social Work and five community partners using a collaborative methodology to address a pressing need within the community ro increase access to primary health care for Black Women and Women of Colour. Women's Health in Women's Hands Community Health Centre, Sistering, Parkdale Community Health Centre, Rexdale Community Health Centre and Planed Parenthood of Toronto developed this community-based participatory-action research project to collaboratively barriers affecting these women, and to develop a model of care that will increase their access to health services. This framework was developed using a process which ensured that community members from the target population and service providers working in multiculrural clinical settings, were a part of the research process. They were given the opportunity to shape the course of action, from the design of the project to the evaluation and dissemination phase.

Two years ago we formed the Coalition ior Women's Economic Advancement to explore ways of dealing with women's worsening economic situations.

Recently, the hospital has dedicated resources towards the development of a strategy aimed at enhancing the hospital's integration with its community partners. This approach will better serve the hospital in the current health care environment where Local Health Integration Networks have been struck to enhance and support local capacity to plan, coordinate and integrate service delivery. MSH has had early success with developing partnerships. These alliances have been linked to programs serving key target populations with _estabhshe~. points of access to MSH. Recognizing the need to build upon these achievements to remain compe~mve, the hospital has developed a Community Integration Strategy. At the forefront of this strategy is C.A.R.E (Community Advisory Reference Engine): the hospital's compendium of POSTER SESSIONS v63 Community Partners. As a single point of access to community partner information, C.A.R.E. is more than a database. C.A.R.E. serves as the foundation for community-focused forecasting and a vehicle for inter and intra-organizational knowledge transfer. Information gleaned from the catalog of community parmers can be used to prepare strategic, long-term partnership plans aimed at ensuring that a comprehensive array of services can be provided to the hospital community. C.A.R.E. also houses a permanent record of the hospital's alliances. This prevents administrative duplication and facilitates the formation of new alliances that best serve both the patient and the hospital. C.A.R.E. is not a stand-alone tool and is most powerful when combined with other aspects of the hospital's Community Integration Strategy. It iscxpected that data from the hospital's community advisory committees and performance measurement department will also be stored alongside stakeholder details. This information can then be used to drive discussions at Senior Management and the Board, ensuring congruence between stakeholder, patient and hospital objectives. The patient stands to benefit from this strategy. The unique, distinct point of reference to a wide array of community services provides case managers and discharge planners with the information they need to connect patients with appropriate community services. Creating these linkages enhances the patient's capacity to convalesce in their homes or places of residence and fosters long-term connections to neighborhood supports. These connections can be used to assist with identifying patients' ongoing health care needs and potentially prevent readmission to hospital.",

Mumcial corporation provides varies conservancy services such as street sweeping, collection of solid waste, removal and transportation, disposal of solid waste, disposal of dead bodies of animals, construction, maintance and cleaning of urinals and public sanitary conveniences. The solid waste becoming complicated due to increase in unplanned urbanization and industrialization, the environment has deteriorated significantly due to inter, intra and international migration stream to Mumbai. The volume of inter state migration to Mumbai is considerably high i.e. 20.89 lakh and international migrant 0.77 lakh have migrated to Mumbai. Present paper gives the view on solid waste management and its implications to environment and health. Pollution from a wide varity of emission, such as from automobiles and industrial activities, has reached critical level in Mumbai, causing respiratory, ocular, water born diseases and other health problems. Sources of generation of waste are -Household waste, commercial waste, Institutional waste, street sweeping, silt removed from drain/nallah/cleanings. Disposal of solid waste in Gr.

The influence of socioeconomic status on the relationship between traffic intensity and hospital admissions for respiratory diagnoses was explored through assessment of confounding by lodging value, expressed as the dollar average over road segments. This indicator of socioeconomic status, as calculated from the Montreal property assessment database, is available at a finer geographic scale than socioeconomic information accessible from the Canadian Census. There was an inverse relationship between traffic intensity estimates and lodging values for those hospitalised (rho -0.23, p 3160 vehicles during che 3 hour morning peak), even after adjustment for lodging value (crude OR 1.35, Cl95% 1.22-1.49; adjusted OR 1.13, Cl95% 1.02-1.25).

We have developed a modeling framework in which we first ~stimate the emissions and transport of contaminants in a city and second, use these estimates along with measured contaminant concentrations in food, to estimate the potential health risk posed by these che.micals. The latter is accomplished using risk assessment. We applied our modeling framework to consider two groups of chemical contaminants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) a.nd the flame re~ardants polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE). PAH originate from vehicles and stationary combustion sources. ~veral PAH are potent carcinogens and some compounds also cause noncancer effects. PBDEs are additive flame retardants used in polyurethane foams (e.g., car seats, furniture) 105fER SESSIONS v67 and cl~ equipm~nt (e.g., compute~~\u00b7 televisio~s). Two out of three PBDEs formulations are being voluntarily phased by mdustry due to rmng levels m human tissues and their world-wide distribution. PBDEs have been .related to adv.erse neurological, developmental and reproductive effects in laboratory IJlimals. We apphed our modelmg framework to the City of Toronto where we considered the southcattral area of 21 by 21 km that has a population of 1.3 million. For PAH, local vehicle traffic and area sources contribute at least half of total PAH in Toronto. Local contributions to PBDEs range from 57-85%, depending on the assumptions made. Air concentrations of both compounds are about 10 times higher downtown than 80 km north of Toronto. Although measured PAH concentrations in food date to the 1980s, we estimate that the greatest exposure and contribution to lifetime cancer risk comes from ingestion of infant formula, which is consistent with toxicological evidence. The next greatest exposure and cancer risk are attributable to eating animal products (e.g. milk, eggs, fish). Breathing downtown air contributes an additional 10 percent to one's lifetime cancer risk. Eating vegetables from a home garden localed downtown contributes negligibly to exposure and risk. For PBDEs, the greatest lifetime exposure comes through breast milk (we did not have data for infant formula), followed by ingestion of dust by the toddler and infant. These results suggest strategies to mitigate exposure and health risk.",

Of the remaining 50 Yo, approx~mately half do not know their status; the other group frequently know their status but are not enrolled m any .sys~em of outpatient care.

As a large urban HIV Center, caring for over 3000 individuals with HIV we have an active inpatient service \".'ith appr~xi~.ately 1800 discharges annually. We decided to survey our inpatients to better charactenze those md1v1duals who were not enrolled in any system of outpatient care. Results: 18% of inpatients were not enrolled in regular outpatient care: 2% at Roosevelt Hospital and 35% at St.Luke\\'s Hospital. Substance abuse and homelessness were highly prevalent in the cohort of patients not enrolled in regular outpatient care. 84% of patients not in care (vs. 33% of those in care) were deemed in need of substance use treatment by the inpatient social worker. 74% of those not in care were homeless (vs. 15% of those in care.)

The Primary Health Care system which is in line with the Alma Ata declaration of of 1978, wsa aimed at making health care available to as many people as possible on the basis of of equity and social justice. Thus, close to two decades, Nigeria has operated Primary Health Care system as a strategy for providing health care for rural and urban dwellers.

This is done within the contest of the country's National Heath Policy of which Pimary Health Care is the main thrust. The study also offers necessary suggestion for policy consideration. In spite of the accessibility to services provided by educated and trained midwifes in many parts of Fars province (Iran) there are still some deliveries conducted by untrained traditional birth attendants in rural parts of the province.

Venice Lido is a popular island within and outside Italy because it hosts the International Cinema Festival yearly. Only few people remember the island for its hospital, which, in the fifties, was one of the most important hospitals in Italy and in Europe, being a modern center for wind-, sun-and thermal-therapy. Since the sixties, its fame became to drop away, since its structure was no longer adequate for the evolving medicine science. At the end of the seventies all the wards were moved into a new big building in the same area. At present the hospital is made up by about forty 'pavilions' (mostly partially used or empty) and a big building, disseminated in a 10 hectares area, on the sea front, on the 500 m long beach. The aim of my research is to suggest a realistic solution, sustainable on the functional use of the area according to basic local needs and economically realizable. I used a philological and multi-disciplinary method, more in detail: -from historical documents, I found what was the very first call of the property and how it adapted to the needs of the demographic development and the sanitary supply over time; -by contacting some operators from different fields, I realized which functions were suitable to the buildings in existence, to the population's needs and to the present sanitary supply. Moreover the planning idea considers: -the debate going on between local people who strongly want to preserve the property, and die ones who want to renew it by different new opportunities; and -the regional sanitary politics, aiming at rationalizing the regional hospitals dislocation, and the budget needs. This plan analyzes and proposes some new alternative solutions to satisfy different needs. The different activities will be dealt out and the environmental fall will be limited as much as possible. After having analyzed its basic call, considered its environmental peculiarities and its position, verified the emerging needs of the local population, the plan proposes 5 different activities: the Hospital; the Social-Rehabilitation Center; the Elderly House; the Thermal Center; the Residential Center; and other activities. Such a plan wants to share in the solution of a basic problem by giving architectonic and functional dignity to an historical completely degraded area and by starting again a social-economical broken off process, by bringing in Venice Lido some fresh necessary elements for its so wished new throw.",

However, some immigrant groups in Canada have historically been uninswed. These groups include failed refugee claimants, those overstaying their visas, and new immigrants in tranSition who are waiting to become eligible for health insurance. Some estimates have suggested that at the present time there may be as many as one hundred thousand undocumented and thus uninsured immigrants in Toronto alone. Understandably, information on the characteristics of this marginalized population is very limited, since undocumented immigrants tend to have little contact with formal institutions. Knowledge of the demographic characteristics of this population may aid in the development of health and social programs to better identify and meet the needs of undocumented immigrants in Toronto.",

Introduction: Having a regular family doctor (RFD) is known to be positively correlated with a good medical follow up, including access to preventive and/or chronic care. Inversely, a lack of primary care may lead to high rates of avoidable hospitalizations, especially among poor people and/or in underserved neighbourhoods.

Latina access to treatment may play an important role in remission from substance abuse. Little is known, however, about Latinas' access to drug treatment. Further, the role of social capital in substance abuse treatment utilization is unknown. This study examines the relative roles of social capital and other factors in obtaining substance abuse treatment, in a three-wave longitudinal study of women ages 18-35 living in high-risk urban areas of Puerto Rico, the Inner City Latina Drug Using Study (ICLDUS). Social capital is measured at the individual level and includes variables from social support and networks, familism, physical environment, and religion instruments of the ICDUS. The study also elucidates the role of treatment received during the study in bringing about changes in social capital. The theoretical framework used in exploring the utilization of substance abuse treatment is the social support approach to social capital. The research addresses three main questions: ( t) does social capital predict parti~ipating in treatment programs? (2) does participation in drug treatment programs increase social capital?, and (3) is there a significant difference among treatment modalities in affecting change in ~ial capital? The findings revealed no significant association between levels of social capital and gettmg treatment. Also, women who received drug treatment did not increase their levels of social capital. The findings, however, revealed a number of significant predictors of social capital and receiving drug ~buse treatment. Predictors of social capital at Wave III include employment status, total monthly mcoi:rie, and baseline social capital. Predictors of receiving drug abuse treatment include perception of physical health and total amount of money spent on drugs. Other different variables were associated to treatment receipt prior to the ICLDUS study. No significant difference in changes of social capital was found among users of different treatment modalities. This research represents an initial attempt to elucidate the two-way relationship between social capital and substance abuse treatment. More work is necessary to unden~nd. ~e role of political forces that promote social inequalities in creating drug abuse problems and ava1lab1hty of treatment; the relationship between the benefits provided by current treatment POSTER SESSIONS v81 sctrings and treatment-seeking behaviors; the paths of recovery; and the efficacy and effectiveness of the trtaanent. and Alejandro Jadad Health professionals in urban centres must meet the challenge of providing equitable care to a population with diverse needs and abilities to access and use available services. Within the Canadian health care system, providers are time-pressured and ill-equipped to deal with patients who face barriers of poverty, literacy, language, culture and social isolation. Directing patients to needed supportive care services is even more difficult than providing them with appropriate technical care. A large proportion of the population do not have equitable access to services and face major problems navigating complex systems. New approaches are needed to bridge across diverse populations and reach out to underserved patients most in need. The objective of this project was to develop an innovative program to help underserved cancer patients access, understand and use needed health and social services. It implemented and evaluated, a pilot intervention employing trained 'personal health coaches' to assist underserved patients from a variety of ethno-linguistic, socio economic and educational backgrounds to meet their supportive cancer care needs. The intervention was tested with a group of 46 underserved cancer patients at the Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto. Personal coaches helped patients identify needs, access information, and use supportive care services. Triangulation was used to compare and contrast multiple sources of quantitative and qualitative evaluation data provided by patients, personal health coaches, and health care providers to assess needs, barriers and the effectiveness of the coach program. Many patients faced multiple barriers and had complex unmet needs. Barriers of poverty and language were the easiest to detect. A formal, systematic method to identify and meet supportive care needs was not in place at the hospital. However, when patients were referred to the program, an overwhelming majority of participants were highly satisfied with the intervention. The service also appeared to have important implications for improved technical health care by ensuring attendance at appointments, arranging transportation and translation services, encouraging adherence to therapy and mitigating financial hardship -using existing community services. This intervention identified a new approach that was effective in helping very needy patients navigate health and social services systems. Such programs hold potential to improve both emotional and physical health out\u00b7 comes. Since assistance from a coach at the right time can prevent crises, it can create efficiencies in the health system. The successful use of individuals who were not licensed health professionals for this purpose has implications for health manpower planning. Needle Exchange Programs (NEPs) have been distributing harm reduction materials in Toronto since 1990. COUNTERfit Harm Reduction Program is a small project operated out of a Community Health Centre in south-east Toronto. The project is operated by a single full-time coordinator, one pan-rime mobile outreach worker and two peers who work a few hours each week. All of COUNTERfit's staff, peers, and volunteers identify themselves as active illicit drug users. Yet the program dis~rib utes more needles and safer crack using kits and serves more illicit drug u~rs t~an the comb1~e~ number of all NEPs in Toronto.

When the govern\u00b7 ment withdrew from direct service provision as reform trends and donor advocacy suggested, how does it perform its new indirect role of managing relations with new direct health services providers in terms of regulating, enabling, and managing relations with these health services providers? In this paper therefore, we seek to investigate how healthcare access and availability in the slums of Nairobi has been impacted upon by the government's withdrawal from direct health care provision. The methodology involved col\u00b7 leering primary data by conducting field visits to 8 health institutions located in the slum areas of Kibera and Korogocho in Nairobi. Purposive random sampling was utilized in this study because this sampling technique allowed the researcher(s) to select those health care seekers and providers who had the required information with respect to the objectives of the study. In-depth Interviews using a semi-structured ques\u00b7 tionnaire were administered ro key informants in health care institutions. This sought to explore ways in which the government and the private sector had responded and addressed in practical terms to new demands of health care provision following the structural adjustment programmes of the 1990s. This was complemented by secondary literature review of publications and records of key governmental, bilateral and multilateral development partners in Nairobi. The study notes a number of weaknesses especially of Kenya's Ministry of Health to perform its expected roles such as managing user fee revenue and financial sustainability of health insurance systems. This changing face of health services provision in Kenya there\u00b7 fore creates a complex situation, which demands greater understanding of the roles of competition and choice, regulatory structures and models of financing in shaving the evolution of health services. We rec\u00b7 ommend that the introduction of user fees, decentralization of service provision and contracting-out of non-clinical to private and voluntary agencies require a new management culture, and new and clear insri\u00b7 tutional relationships. Experience with private sector involvement in health projects underlines the need not only for innovative financial structures to deal with a multitude of contractual, political, market and risks, but also building credible structures to ensure that health services projects are environmentally responsive, socially sensitive, economically viable, and politically feasible.",

Because of their double minority status of being gay and Asian, many Asian men who have sex with men (MSM) are struggling with unique issues. Dealing with racism in both mainstream society and the gay communiry, cultural differences, traditional family relations, and language challenges can be some of their everyday srruggles. However, culturally, sexually, and linguistically specific services for Asian MSM are very limited. A lack of availability and accessibiliry of culturally appropriate sexual health services isolates Asian MSM from mainstream society, the gay community, and their own cultural communities, deprives them of self-esteem, and endangers their sexual well-being. This research focuses on the qualita\u00b7 tive narrative voices of Asian MSM who express their issues related to their sexualiry and the challenges of asking for help. By listening to their voices, practitioners can get ideas of what we are missing and how we need to intervene in order to reach Asian MSM and ensure their sexual health.",

P4-38 (C) Identifying Key Techniques to Sustain Interpretation Services for Assisting Newcomers Isolated by Linguistic and Cultural Barriers from Accessing Health Services S. Gopi Krishna lntrodaetion: The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is home to many newcomer immigrants and other vulnerable groups who can't access health resources due to linguistic, cultural and systemic barriers. Linguistic and cultural issues are of special concern to suburbs like Scarborough, which is home to thousands of newcomer immigrants and refugees lacking fluency in English. Multilingual Community ~nterpreter. Service~ (MCIS) is a non-profit social service organization mandated to provide high quality mterpretanon services. To help newcomers access health services, MCIS partnered with the Scarborough Network of Immigrant Serving Organizations (SNISO) to recruit and train volunteer interpreters to accompany clienrs lacking fluency in English and interpret for them to access health services at various locati?ns, incl~~ing communiry ~C:-lth centres/social service agencies and hospitals.

Health cannot be defined only as an outcome of 'medical care' but also as one of 'social action'; the responsibility of disease prevention and health promotion rests not only on governments, but also with DOn\u00b7govemmentorgan izations, the community, and individuals.

There will also be a focus on lessons learned in building community service provider-hospital relationships. According to Statistics Canada (2001) 49% of the Toronto population was born outside of Canada and 21 % were new immigrants. Immigrants often arrive in Canada in superior health compared to the Canadian born population, but they lose this health advantage over time. Changes in immigrant health status over time may be attributed to a variety of factors including barriers to accessing and receiving care as well as limitations in the mainstream health service organizations and their approaches to health care delivery (Hyman, 2001 ) . For example, immigrant women are less likely to receive pap tests, which places them at a greater risk for developing cervical cancer. Similarly, immigrant women receive less mammography screening than their Canadian counterparts. The Immigrant Women's Health Centre Mobile Health Unit (MHU) was created as an alternative care delivery model to address the need for increased accessibility as well as culturally and linguistically appropriate reproductive health care. Toronto Western Hospital and the Immigrant Women's Health Centre have formed a collaborative partnership which incorporates a primary care nurse practitioner and lay ethnocultural counselors providing care on the MHU. Currently, a qualitative ethnonursing study is underway to understand the unique experiences of women using the MHU for their reproductive health care as well as the perspectives of the MHU health care providers. Based on a literature review and preliminary findings from provider and participant interviews, the proposed presentation will address the themes of health status for immigrant and refugee women, accessibility issues as well strategies to improve their reproductive health care. We will discuss benefits as well as limitations to health care provision using this alternative service delivery model.",

A major geographical concept is accessibility, or the ease of moving from an origin to a destination point, which has been recently explored in several health promotion-related stud\u00b7 ies. There are several methods of calculating accessibility to an urban feature, each with its own strengths, drawbacks and level of precision that can be applied to various health promotion research issues. The purpose of this paper is to describe, compare and contrast four common methods of calculating accessibility to urban amenities in terms of their utility to obesity-related health promotion research. Practical and conceptual issues surrounding these methods are introduced and discussed with the intent of providing health promotion researchers with information useful for selecting the most appropria1e accessibility method for their research goal~ ~ethod: This paper describes methodological insights from two studies, both of which assessed the neighbourhood-level accessibility of fast-food establishments in Edmonton, Canada -one which used a relatively simple coverage method and one which used a more complex minimum cos1 method.",

However, a major drawback of both methods is that they assume the characteristics of the a~e~ities and of the populations using them are all the same, and are static. The gravity potential method is introduced as an alternative, since it is \u00b7capable of factoring in measures of quality and choice. A n~mber of conceptual and pr~ctical iss~es, illustrated by the example of situational influences on food choice, make the use of the gravity potential model unwieldy for health promotion research into sociallydetermined conditions such as obesity.",

In the Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) region, there are more than 100,000 individuals having some probability of drug or alcohol dependence. To accommodate this potential demand for addiction related services, VCH provides various services and treatment, including four levels of Withdrawal Management Services (WMS). Clients seeking WMS are screened and referred to appropriate services through a central telephone intake service (ACCESS I). The present study seeks to rigorously evaluate one of the services, Vancouver Detox, a medically monitored 24-bed residential detox facility, and its clients. Doing so will allow decision makers to utilize evidence based decision-making in order to improve the accessibility and efficiency of WMS, and therefore, the health of these clients.",

Many institucions have incorporated cultural compecency craining and culturally sensicive models of health care delivery, hoping co encourage better relacionships becween patients and providers, more posicive views about the health care system, and, ulcimacely, improved health outcomes for minority patients. The current scudy tests whether cultural distance between physicians and patients, measured by racial discordance, predicts poorer patient attitudes about their providers and the health care system in a severely disadvantaged HIV-infected population in New York City that typically reports inconsistent patterns of health care.",

Such attempts have resulted in significantly compromised access to primary care within the community. As a consequence, patients are, out of necessity, inappropriately relying upon emergency departments for primary care services as well as access to specialty services. Within the hospital, rationalization has resulted in bed closures and severely rmricted access to in-patient services. Emergency physicians and their patients are in a tenuous position having many needs but few resources. Furthermore, in response to demands for greater accountability, physicians have also adopted rationality in the form of evidence-based medicine. Ultimately, ho~ever, rationality whether imposed upon, or adopted by, the profession significantly undermines physu.:1ans' ability to make decisions in the best interests of their patients.",

This difference might be partly caused by problems migrants have with the Dutch language and health care and welfare system.

However, the lack of integration of the centers with the existing health care and welfare facilities in the different districts hampers further implementation . Therefore, in most districts the Information Centres will be closed down as independent facilicities in the near future, and efforts are made to better connect the position of migrant health advisor in existing facilities. The 2005 WHO Report ranks the Philippines as ninth among 22 countries with a high TB prevalence. About a fourth of the country's population is infected, with majority of cases coming from the lower socioeconomic segments of the community. Metro Manila is not only the economic and political capital of the Philippines but also the site of major universities and educational institutions. Initial interviews with the school's clinicians have established the need to come up with treatment guidelines and protocols for students and personnel when TB is diagnosed. These cases are often identified during annual physical examinations as part of the school's requirements. In many instances, students and personnel diagnosed with TB are referred to private physicians where they are often lost to follow-up and may have failure of treatment due to un monitored self-administered therapy. This practice ignores the school clinic's great potential as a TB treatment partner. Through its Single Practice Network (SPN) Initiative, the Philippine Tuberculosis Initiatives for the Private Sector (Philippine TIPS), has established a model wherein school clinics serve as satellite treatment partners of larger clinics in the delivery of the Directly Observed Treatment, Short Course (DOTS) protocol. This \"treatment at the source\" allows school-based patients to get their free government-suppl ied TB medicines from the clinic each day. It also cancels out the difficulty in accessing medicines through the old model where the patient has to go to the larger clinic outside his/her school to get treatment. The model also enables the clinic to monitor the treatment progress of the student and assumes more responsibility over their health. This experience illustrates how social justice in health could be achieved from means other than fund generation. The harnessing of existing health service providers in urban communities through standardized models of treatment delivery increases the probability of treatment success, not only for TB but for other conditions as well.",

Findings from the present study on early life experi-e~ce have the potential to inform valuable prevention programs for problem substance use before disturbances become severe and therefore, typically, much more difficult to ameliorate effectively. The ~ACT (~r-City Men~ Health Study Predicting filV/AIDS, Club and Other Drug Transi-b~) Study 15 a multi-level study aimed at determining the association between features of the urban enYJrOnment mental health, drug use, and risky sexual behaviors. The study is randomly sampling FOSTER SESSIONS v99 neighborhood residents and assessing the relations between characteristics of 36 ethnographically defined urban neighborhoods and the health outcomes of interest. A limitation of existing systematic methods for evaluating the physical and social environments of urban neighborhoods is that they are expensive and time-consuming, therefore limiting the number of times such assessments can be conducted. This is particularly problematic for multi-year studies, where neighborhoods may change as a result of seasonality, gentrification, municipal projects, immigration and the like. Therefore, we developed a simpler neighborhood assessment scale that systematically assessed the physical and social environment of urban neighborhoods. The IMPACT neighborhood evaluation scale was developed based on existing and validated instruments, including the New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey which is performed by the U.S. Census Bureau, and the NYC Mayor's Office of Operations Scorecard Cleanliness Program, and modified through pilot testing and cognitive testing with neighborhood residents. Aspects of the physical environment assessed in the scale included physical decay, vacancy and construction, municipal investment and green space. Aspects of the social environment measured include social disorder, social trust, affluence and formal and informal street economy. The scale assesses features of the neighborhood environment that are determined by personal (e.g., presence of dog feces), community (e.g., presence of a community garden), and municipal (e.g., street cleanliness) factors. The scale is administered systematically block-by-block in a neighborhood. Trained research staff start at the northeast corner of an intersection and walk around the blocks in a clockwise direction. Staff complete the scale for each street of the block, only evaluating the right side of the street. Thus for each block, three or more assessments are completed. We are in the process of assessing psychometric properties of the instrument, including inter-rater reliability and internal consistency, and determining the minimum number of blocks or street segments that need to be assessed in order to provide an accurate estimate of the neighborhood environment. These data will be presented at the conference.",

Nearly half (46%) did not anticipate having a place to stay for at least 30 days upon release. Factors significantly associated housing stability upon release were: high Family Support Score (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR) 6.15; 95% Confidence Interval (95% Cl) 1.76, 21.61), high Neighborhood Stability Score (AOR 4.41; 95% Cl 1.25, 15.52), wanting a commercial sex worker (CSW) support group (AOR 0.25; 95% Cl 0.10, 0.62); and identifying as bisexual (AOR 0.24; 95% Cl 0.07, 0.75).

Malnutrition is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality among the child. The aim of present study was to investigate the nutritional status and its relation to socioeconomic conditions of urban disadvantaged child of under five years age. Nutritional status was determined by anthropoemetric measurement(Heig ht, Weight, Mid-arm circumference etc.). Determination of total protein and serum albumin were done for biochemical examination. Haematological examination was done by blood haemoglobin profile estimation by cynmethhaemoglob in method and determination of haematocrit value or packed cell volume (PCV). Stool examination for ova of Hook Worm, round worm, trichuris species and other species were also done. Relevant information on socioeconomic characteristics was recorded by interviewing the house hold head using pretested questionnaire. our study demonstrated that nutritional status of the children are positively correlated with family income, parents level of formal education and negatively related to the family size. The effect of family income on the nutritional status, haematological and biochemical indices of urban disadvantaged child under five will be discussed in detail which will help us to determine proper way of utilization of health care facilities exists in developing countries. Introduction: With the increase in morbidity and reduction in mortality and with the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), there is increasing focus on the determinants of healthrelated quality of life (HRQOL) in HIV-infection. The focus on the present study is to examine the relationship between social support, depression, and HIV disease severity, and the extent to which these variables impact on HRQOL in adult men with HIV-infection.",

Few studies of AIDS outcomes have focused on how commu\u00b7 nity setting influences the effectiveness of care delivery. The principle research questions were: 1) What is the relationship between the locations of areas with concentrations of PL WA and the distribution of both primary and ancillary service providers? 2) How has the widespread availability of HAART (after 1996) impacted AIDS outcomes at the community level? 3) How do AIDS mortality and fatality rates vary when related community characteristics, such as household income, ethnic mix, and geographic access to primary and ancillary HIV/AIDS services are considered?

Although it is clear that ancillary services are operating in the areas of greatest need, their effectiveness remains limited. Understanding the reasons for t~is, be they lack of adequate resources for inner city service providers, failure to reach target popula\u00b7 tmns or other causes, requires additional research. In 20?3, Y.out~ who were able to speak either French or English and had been absent from their parent's/ c~regivers ~es.1dence for at least three consecutive nights took part in the survey which consisted of inter\u00b7 viewer-adm1ms tered question~aires. P.arti~i~an~s were recruited from drop in centres in 7 cities across <?-nada.Y~uth self-report as either using in1ect1on or non-injection drugs. Statistical analyses were car\u00b7 r1ed out using SAS version 8. The 'home' is a contested site for many women living in urban areas. Women living in poverty and using illicit drugs are largely excluded from participation in dominant 'home-base' gender roles of wife and mother because of economic disadvantage. They thus 'make home' in ways that are specific to their everyday experiences. While research has established links between housing, health and drug use, this literature does not tend to consider the meanings that home may have within the lives of women who lack access to adequate tenured living spaces. This presentation reports the findings of my Master's thesis work. Using grounded theory methodology within a poststructuralist feminist conceptual framework, I conducted in-depth, open-ended interviews with 11 women living in the Toronto area. The women were recruited from within the community through posters at different social service agencies (e.g., drop-in centres, community health centres). They were asked to describe their housing experiences and what home meant to them over the course of their lives. Through the data analysis process, a substantive theory of 'making home' for women living in poverty and using illicit drugs emerged. The central concept of making home is a continual process of learning about and interacting with the environment. The process of making home entails different subprocesses: finding home (knowing what is available and accessible, and accessing home), adaptation, and leaving home. The different meanings of home that women developed from their experiences and knowledge emerged as critical components for the process of making home. The women I interviewed were very mobile and experienced constant change with regards to home. Home was not considered only in relation to physical living space. Home could be made within a relationship or with regards to a possession. While dominant meanings of home relation to tenured living spaces are generally positive, my research indicated that home could also be a negative context. The presentation will describe my research process and findings as well as the theoretical and policy implications of my results. In the western democracies, social citizenship bundles the right to social provision (defined as a share of the social good, not necessarily proportionate to the market value of a citizen's contribution) with participation in the paid labour force. For this reason, social citizenship rights, which usually involve some kind of redistributive measures, are a key mechanism by which states ensure economic equality, or at least, economic equality of opportunity, but are also a mechanism of social exclusion. Social rights are inscribed around a single kind of relationship, that which exists between a male family breadwinner and the paid labor market; those who make economic contributions that fall outside this relationship -such as unpaid care-work, or, work that occurs in shadow or underground economiesare to a greater or lesser degree barred from accessing citizen-based social provisions. Furthermore, social provision that occurs outside of the breadwinner/market-eco nomy dyad is very often meanstested and is accompanied by regulatory state apparatuses (this includes a range of social services, from welfare payments, to child-care subsidies, to disability pensions). Social citizenship is thus stratified; the legal relationship that is at the heart of social citizenship acts as a form of social closure against claims for a share of the social good made by those who are 'lesser' citizens than others. Of particular interest in this paper is how citizenship inequalities translate into inequalities in the social provisions that emerge from economic participation: the right to safety on the job, protection from employer harassment, protection from the vagaries of the market as well the right to adequate, comprehensive, and appropriate health services. Drawing on mixed methods, longitudinal data from adult sex workers (n= 170) located in two research sites with different social welfare regimes -one in Canada and one in the U.S. -we examine the consequences of working in a \"shadow\" or \"underground\" economy on various facets of health and access to health services, taking into consideration the mediating role that citizenship constructs and social welfare regimes play in accessing other key social and economic determinants of health. Methods: The study population included methadone patients (re)admitted at the MHS in the period from 1/1/1996 to 31/1/2002, born in the Netherlands, Morocco, Surinam, Dutch Antilles or Turkye, and officially registered in the population register of Amsterdam. The population register was used to ascer\u00b7 rain the vital status. Causes of death were provided by the Central Bureau of Statistics. Mortality was categorised as HIV related, directly drug related (overdose) and other.mortality.",

A group comprising academics, health profession\u00b7 als, and commumty workers who have experience in food insecurity, developed a pilot study in Ottawa that sought to und~rstand the lived experience of food insecurity.

The majority of these innovations (e.g., specialized courts) exist in urban settings.

Urban courts (which process comparatively large numbers of people) have implemented services to address the needs of the mentally ill. The present analyses strongly suggest that program development should be closely linked to the demonstration of need. The results caution that a uniform approach to court programs for the mentally ill is likely to be inefficient, over-supplying services in some settings and underestimating need in others. Results: Public settings used for injection are characterized by highly unhygienic conditions, the presence of unsafely disposed syringes, limited availability of sterile syringes and a lack of sterile water for injecting. A number of unsafe injection practices observed were common among public injectors. The presence of police officers nearby and the potential of assault by street predators fostered rushed injecting among those consuming drugs in public spaces. The ecological features of these environments encourage unhygienic and unsafe injecting practices, heighten risk for overdose and the transmission of blood borne viruses. Introduction: Approximately 13% of women experience depression in the first weeks or months after giving birth. Although it has been argued that postpartum depression (PPD) is a culture-bound P~ nomenon, experienced only in Western, industrialized countries, recent international research studies have confirmed that the prevalence of PPD is similar around the world. However, little is known about variables that may influence the experience of PPD in women from diverse cultures and immigrant women. Research is needed to identify the role culture may play in the presentation of PPD (i.e., types of symptoms most commonly reported), how women from various racial, ethnic and cultural backgrounds perceive and attribute their symptoms of PPD, and finally, how culture can be appropriately addressed in PPD treatment programs.",

Over the past decade, there has been increasing research devoted to the impact of childhood sexual abuse. Some studies have suggested that the experience of childhood sexual abuse is associated with substance use and abuse, at\u00b7 risk sexual behaviour and subsequent higher rates of HIV infection (Ompad et al., 2005; Cinq-Mars et al., 2003; Brown et al., 1997) . Other studies have found that childhood abuse, especially sexual abuse, is c_o~n among stree~ youth (Noell et al. 1999 ). This study compares sexually abused males and females livtng on the street ~th non-sexually abused street youth, with regards to unsafe sexual behaviours and e~ures to potmnal t:DV sources (e.g., tattooing, body piercing and injection drug use). The hypothe-SIS oft~ ~nt study IS that the prevalence of HN-risk-related behaviours will be higher among street youth vtctuns of sexual abuse than those who have not been sexually abused. The sample includes 919 youths aged 13 to 25 who met specific criteria's for itinerancy (649 male and 270 female, with a mean ~of 19.4 Y\u00b7 and a standard deviation of 2.9). They were recruited through five organisations working ~th~ you~ and were~ of an ongoing cohort study. All youth completed a 45 to 60 minute ques\u00b7 ~onnaue on their sexual behaviours, use of drugs and alcohol and other HIV risk behaviours. Oral spec\u00b7 unens for HIV testing were. also collected. A total of 357 (38.9%) youth reported at least one incident of ~I \u2022~use/assault (1~1 girls (67.0% of all the girls) and 176 boys (27.2% of all the boys]). Preliminary descnpnve analyses pomt to sexually abused/assaulted youth showing the highest prevalence of sexual POSTER SESSIONS v113 at-risk behaviours. For example, 43.3% of sexual abuse/assault victims have engaged in prostitution in their lives compared with 13.4% in the non-sexually abused/assaulted group. In addition, 42.6% of sexual abuse/assault victims reported having injected drugs, compared with 32.0% in the non-sexually abused/assaulted group. More statistical analyses will bring other significant factors to light, especially when we analyze separately those victim of childhood sexual abuse as compare to those victim of sexual assault after childhood. Elucidating the risk factors for getting involved in HIV-Risk-Related behaviours is important for the development of comprehensive and appropriate prevention and treatment intervention strategies. Introduction: New immigrants and refugees to Canada frequently emigrate from regions of the world where intestinal parasitic infections with worms are endemic. Of note, some of these parasites area capable of surviving for years to decades within a given host and can have life threatening consequences many years after initial infection. Thus, early diagnosis and treatment of intestinal parasitic worms is considered important in high risk immigrant populations, however there remains a lack of consensus regarding the best method of accomplishing this. Diagnosing worm infections through stool examinations is costly and has limited sensitivity, while presumptive treatment of all immigrants, although advocated by some, is expensive and results in healthy individuals being unnecessarily treated. Herein, we examine the utility of a hematologic marker (i.e. peripheral blood eosinophilia) as a screening instrument to identify parasitic worm infections in new immigrants to Toronto.",

Like proposals that have come before, this most recent proposal is controversial among many homeless advocates and service providers because it is perceived as intrusive, likely to undercount the target population, and unnecessary for addressing the problem. Advocates of the count view it as necessary to gauge the scope of the problem and advise city leaders about how to most effectively direct resources ro.the various homeless services. This paper first reviews the history of efforts to count homeless populat10ns m Toronto, describing the motivations and arguments of people on both sides of the issue. Second, the paper reviews the methodological complexities of counting homeless populations, describing approaches that use shelter-counts, administrative data and street observations. Those interested in counts for Toronto and elsewhere can benefit from this review of approaches that have been proposed and carried out in other municipalities. Third, the paper proposes a new community-base d strategy that joins the skills of methodologists, local experts, and service providers to ensure a fair and accurate count. The method of systematic social observation avoids some of the problems of early counts by utilizing a repeated identification approach to minimize undercount bias. The method also has the advantage of involving and compensating homeless individuals for assisting with the street count estimates. The estimation approach can be implemented on a rolling basis throughout the year.",

The rising incidence of obesity in children is a major national health concern and obesity in first and second-generation immigrant children also continues to rise. We know that parents (particularly mothers) shape children's early diet patterns and that immigrant mothers experience additional challenges related to acculturation and assimilation into a new culture, however there is a paucity of literature concerning the effect of immigrant adaptation to American culture on the nutrition of children. In addition, new immigrant knowledge about the causes of obesity and the resulting health implications for childhood obesity has not been assessed and reported. This qualitative study used focus group methodology to discuss views and practices related to the introduction of food for infants and feeding practices for young children, along with a discussion on knowledge and beliefs related to the causes and health implications of child\u00b7 hood obesity. Ten Dominican Mothers' of young children (birth to 6 years old) who reside in a small town in the western frontier area of the DR were participants in the focus group. Results from this srudy will be compared to results from an identical study that will be conducted in Fall 2005 with new immi\u00b7 grant mothers from the DR to the Boston area.

Results of the study show that generally, the state of homelessness reflects a feeling of discontent, disenfranchisem ent and pow!!\u00b7 lessness that contribute to their difficulty in getting out of the streets. The perceived problems andlar dangers in living on the streets are generally associated with their exposure to extreme weather condiriOll! and their status of being vagrants making them prone to harassment by the police. The health needs of the street dweller respondents established in this study indicate that the existing health related servias for the homeless poor is ineffective. The street dweller respondents have little or no access to social and health services, if any. Some respondents claimed that although they were able to get service from heallh centers or government hospitals, the medicines required for treatment are not usually free and are beyond their means. This group of homeless people needs well-planned interventions to hdp them improve their current situations and support their daily living. The expressed social needs of the sucet dweller respondents were significantly concentrated on the economic aspect, which is, having a perma\u00b7 nent source of income to afford food, shelter, clothing and education. These reflect the street dweller' s need for personal upliftment and safety. In short, most of their expressed need is a combination of socioeconomic resources that would provide long-term options that are better than the choice of living on the streets. The suggested interventions based on the findings will be discussed. .

Congestive heart failure (CHF) has become a pandemic. As the baby boomer generation ages, the number of CHF cases will rise dramatically. (Young, J. & Mills, R.,2004). After the age of 45, each proceeding decade doubles the incidence level of CHF. The average person has a 1 in 5 chance of developing heart failure within their lifespan according to the Framingham study (NIH.gov). Individuals aging 65 or older compose over half of the entire documented heart failure population. In this age group, CHF is the leading cause of hospitalization. Many patients are continuously readmitted. It is estimated that the CHF population will increase by one million within the next 25 years. Mortality was at 50% for a two year period and 70% for five years (Young, J. & Mills, R.,2004 ). data from: AHA As technology evolves, the understanding of the nature of heart failure has become clearer. In the beginning of the 20th century heart failure was diagnosed as a condition that presented with edema (swelling) in the extremities caused by water retention. Treatment in the beginning of the past cenrury was limited to abdominal drainage and diuretics. The discovery of the heart's insufficient pumping ability in heart failure patients lead to new surgeries and devices such as heart transplants and ventricular assist devices (bridge until transplant is available). Ventricular hypertrophy often occurs before the development of heart failure. Hypertrophy is the term given for cardiac remodeling. Cardiac remodeling also includes chamber dilation (Young, J. & Mills, R.,2004) . CHF financial burden The US Healthcare Financing administration has ranked CHF as the highest cost illness in the diagnose-related area. Direct costs related to CHF in the US for 2004 were nearly $26 billion. These costs included hospital admissions, physician fees, home health aids and medications. Indirect costs were over $2 billion in 2004. Loss of jobs or death due to CHF was the criteria for this category (Young, J. & Mills, R., 2004).",

Introduction: Strict adherence to prescribed regimens is required to derive maximal benefit from highly active antireuoviral therapy (HAART) in persons living with HIV/AIDS (PHAs). Adherence is a key determinant of the degree and durability of viral suppression. Adherence is also essential in reducing the spread of HIV and ensuring that today's treatments remain effective for as long as possible.

Eleven of the 19 studies demonstrated a statistically significant advantage associated with the described adherence intervention.

While cases of measles are uncommon in Canada today, the disease continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and death in the developing world. As a result of human migration, measles cases still occur in Canada, primari~ among immigrants, returning travelers, and other susceptible groups. Canada's National Advisory Council on Immunizations (NACI) recommends that immigrants without records of measles immunization be considered for vac:cination since these individuals may not have been appropriately vaccinated in their native country. On rhe other hand, natural immunity to measles in immigrants is likely to be high given the high incidence of disease in developing parts of rhe world. Thus it remains unclear if the most efficient strategy to achieve high levels of measles immunity in immigrants should entail initial serologic screening followed by vaccination of susceptible individuals or preemptive vaccination of all persons lacking immunization records. Understanding the epidemiology of measles immunity in immigrant populations could help guide such decisions.",

Conclusions: BM! was strongly patterned by individual-level social position in urban Canada. The incremental influence on BMI of neighbourhood related to the neighbourhood's social conditions and not to their physical form.

Through in-depth interviews with 140 street youth in Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, Calgary, Ottawa and Vancouver, this paper explores healthy and not-so healthy practices of young people living on the street. Qualitative interviews with 45 health/ social service providers complement the analysis. More specifically, the investigation uncovers how street youth understand health and wellness; how they define good and bad health; and their experiences in accessing diverse health services. Findings suggest that living on the street impacts physical, emotional and spiritual well\u00b7being, leading to cycles of despair, anger and helplessness. The majority of street youth services act as \"brokers\" for young people who desire health care services yet refuse to approach formal heal~h care organizational structures.

Water and sanitation services are mainly provided by exploitative vendors who operate without any regulatory mechanism and charge exorbitantly for their poor services. For instance slum residents pay about 8 times more for water than non-slum households. Water supply is irregular and residents often go for a week without water; prices are hiked and hygiene is compromised during such shortages. Most houses do not have toilets and residents have to use commercial toilets or adopt unorthodox means such as disposing of their excreta in the nearby bushes or plastic bags that they throw in the open. As a direct result of the poor environmental conditions and inaccessible health services, slum residents are not only sicker, they are also less likely to utilise health services and consequently, more likely to die than non-slum residents. For instance, the prevalence of diarrhoea among children in the slums was 31 % compared to 13 % in Nairobi as a whole and 17% in rural areas, while under-five mortality rates were 151/1000, 62/1000 and 113/1000 respectively.",

In addition, insight into mechanisms underlying the differences between and within ethnic groups and into barriers to mental health care will provide pretexts for the improvement of pre\u00b7 vention and mental health care for migrant groups. This study aimed to determine spatial patterns of mortality and morbidity of five major health problems in an urban environment: homicides, pregnancy among adolescents ((<20 years old), asthma hospitalization among young children(< 5 years old) and two mosquito-borne diseasesdengue and visceral leishmaniasis, during 1999-2003. All events were obtained through the City Health database and, subsequently, geoproccsscd using the address of residence and the geographical and administrative division of the municipality, composed by 80 unit of planning (UP), which in tum were formed, each one, by census tract units. Two research questions were investigated: are there spatial patterns to the events dis\u00b7 tribution, and moreover, are these patterns overlapping across space? We use thematic maps, index of comparative mortality/morbidity by UP and the overlapped rank of the 20th worse UP rates for each event. A spatial pattern of high rates of homicides, proportion of young mothers and hospitalization of asthma were overlapping in areas social and economically disadvantaged. For mosquito-borne diseases, high rates with great dispersion were found in unprivileged areas in contrast with very low rares among privileged ones. These results pointed toward a coexistence of heavier burden of diseases for those living in areas of the city where misery, poverty, lack of political public health may be modulating social health problems. A possible environmental intervention in one mosquito\u2022bome disease might be playing a role in the occurrence of other. Although with limitations, this study may provide useful information for a joint urban planning under the public perspective, articulated for use in health impact assessment.",

Findings indicate that neighborhood quality is a powerful predictor of healrh 1tatu1 rhan socioeconomic status and individual life stressors.

They can also weaken urban social networks, their associated protective norms and their informal social control mechanisms which can lead to increased sexual and drug risk behaviors and violence (Fullilove 2004; Wallace & Wallace1998, Aral 2002 , Friedman & Reid 2000 Hankins et al 2002) . For example, the 1979 revolution and transition to theocratic rule, and subsequent urban and national conflicts, have been followed by many urban youth in Iran engaging in clandestine high-risk sexual and drug behaviors. In Palestine, conflicts and restrictions on movement have led to increased fatalities from chronic diseases due to limited access to hospitals and modern medical facilities (Union of Palestinian Medical Relief Committees); and heroin use and violence-related blood exposure have also increased. Social movements \"from below\" that are rooted both in urban social network dynamics and in underlying patterns of injustice can have both protective and risky effects. For example, the social movements that led to the collapse of the USSR and its dependent governments in other countries-with subsequent increases in sex trade, alcoholism, drug use, tuberculosis, HIV, STis, and mortality in many localities-were based originally on such city-based movements in Eastern Europe. Their impacts on health were mediated by urban social dynamics and structures. Some urban social movements have improved health by prevent\u00b7 ing the spread of HIV, hepatitis and other diseases. Examples include movements of (a) gays and lesbians and (b) drug users. These have been rooted in social networks that overlap with risk networks. Theories of urban health should include social conflict as a core concept. Mechanisms that generate conflicts and the pathways by which conflicts affect health should be a major part of Urban Health research agendas.",

This presentation will focus on some of the issues created by this influx of populations, the ways that 9 cities in 8 countries are dealing with them, and the efforts to promote local participation and solutions in management and decision-making. The methodology used to collect this information has been to draw upon and analyze information produced by the mayor's and Ministry of Health and Development offices in each of the cities under consideration. An analysis of the impact of urbanization on health and health determinants will be presented. The information covers issues such as health status by geographic areas within the cities, highlighting issues such as marginality, barriers and physical, economic and cultural constructs and inequities in the delivery of and access to essential services (such as health, education, water, and basic sanitation). Issues of governance and citizen participation will be highlighted to provide insight in~o the balance of power and mechanisms for decision-making at the local level. Part of the analysis will show the relationship between democratic processes and social participation. Public ~olicies will be reviewed to indicate those that are most beneficial in promoting health and overcoming barriers to it, as well as ways of capitalizing on local assets and resources. Final~y, evidence of effectiveness of various strategies will be indicated. The presentation will conclude wuh suggesuons for future strategic directions to improve the quality of life and the promotion of health in large urban centers of the Americas.

Yet much remains to be learned ahour the connections between urban poverty and health. It is not known what percentage of all urban poor live in slums, that is, in communities of concentrated poverty; neither is it known what proportion of slum residents are, in fact, poor. Funhermore, no quantitative accounting is yet available that would sep\u00b7 arare the health risks of slum life into those due to a househoid\u2022s own poverty and those stemminic from poveny in the surrounding neighborhood. If urban health interventions are to be effectively targeted in developing countries, substantial progress must be made in addressing these cenrral issues.

Using multivariate statistical methods. we find, in both settings: ( 11 substan\u00b7 rial evidence of living standards heterogeneity within the slums; (21 strong evidence indicating that household-level poverty is an imponant influence on health; and (3) staristically significant (though less strong) evidence that with household living standards held constant, neighborhood levels of poverty adversely affect health.

            "text": "Mumbai is the commercial capital of India. As the hub of a rapidly transiting economy, Mumbai provides an interesting case study into the health of urban populations in a developing country. With high-rise multimillion-dollar construction projects and crowded slums next to each other, Mumbai presents a con\u00b7 trast in development. There are a host of hi-tech hospitals which provide high quality care to the many who can afford it (including many westerners eager to jump the queue in their healthcare systems-'medical tour\u00b7 ism'), at the same time there is a overcrowded and strained public healthcare system for those who cannot afford to pay. Voluntary organizations are engaged in service provision as well as advocacy. The paper will outline role of the voluntary sector in the context of the development of the healthcare system in Mumbai. Mumbai has distinct upper, middle and lower economic classes, and the health needs and problems of all three have similarities and differences. These will be showcased, and the response of the healthcare system to these will be documented. A rising HIV prevalence rate, among the highest in India, is a challenge to the Mumbai public healthcare system. The role of the voluntary sector in service provision, advocacy, and empowerment of local populations with regards to urban health has been paramount. The emergence of the voluntary sector as a major player in the puzzle of urban Mumbai health, and it being visualized as voices of civil society or communiry representatives has advantages as well as pitfalls. This paper will be a unique attempt at examining urban health in India as a complex web of players. The influence of everyday socio\u00b7polirical-cultural and economic reality of the urban Mumbai population will be a cross cutting theme in the analysis. The paper will thus help in filling a critical void in this context. The paper will thus map out issues of social justice, gender, equiry, effect of environment, through the lens of the role of the voluntary sector to construct a quilt of the realiry of healthcare in Mumbai. The successes and failures of a long tradi\u00b7 tion of the active advocacy and participation of the voluntary sector in trying to achieve social justice in the urban Mumbai community will be analyzed. This will help in a better understanding of global urban health, and m how the voluntary sector/NGOs fir into the larger picture.",

P6-16 (C) Integrating TQM (Total Quality Management), Good Governance and Social Mobilization Principles in Health Promotion Leadership Training Programmes for New Urban Settings in 12 Countries/ Areas: The Prolead Experience Susan Mercado, Faren Abdelaziz, and Dorjursen Bayarsaikhan Introduction: Globalization and urbanization have resulted in \"new urban settings\" characterized by a radical process of change with positive and negative effects, increased inequities, greater environmental impacts, expanding metropolitan areas and fast-growing slums and vulnerable populations. The key role of municipal health governance in mitigating and modulating these processes cannot be overemphasized. New and more effective ways of working with a wide variety of stakeholders is an underpinning theme for good governance in new urban settings. In relation to this, organizing and sustaining infrastructure and financing to promote health in cities through better governance is of paramount importance. There is a wealth of information on how health promotion can be enhanced in cities. Despite this, appropriate capacity building programmes to enable municipal players to effectively respond to the challenges and impacts on health of globalization, urbanization and increasing inequity in new urban settings are deficient. The WHO Kobe Centre, (funded by the Kobe Group( and in collaboration with 3 Regional Offices (EMRO, SEARO, WPRO) with initial support from the Japan Voluntary Contribution, developed a health promotion leadership training programme called \"Prolead\" that focuses on new and autonomous structures and sustainable financing for health promotion in the context of new urban settings.",

Surprisingly, given the large number of people potentially affected, very little is known about the health and safety hazards that could affect both passengers and transit workers; these include physical (e.g., noise, vibration, accidents, electrified sources, temperature extremes), biological (e.g., transmission of infectious diseases, either through person-to-person spread or vector-borne, for example, through rodents), chemical (e.g., exposure to toxic and irritant chemicals and metals, gas emissions, fumes), electro-magnetic radiation, and psychosocial (e.g., violence, workstress). More recently, we need to consider the threat of terrorism, which could take the form of a mass casualty event (e.g., resulting from conventional incendiary devices), radiological attack (e.g., \"dirty bomb\"), chemical terrorist attack (e.g., sarin gas), or bioterrorist attack (e.g., weapons grade anthrax).

The clinic has been extremely busy and well received by the youth. This workshop will demonstrate how five community organizations have come together to meet the needs of high risk youths in Ottawa. This presentation will showcase the development of the clinic from its inception through its first year including reaction of the youths, partnerships and lessons learned. It will also focus on its sustainability without continued funding.

Three broad rime ranges have been considered for analysis: the 1950s, 1970s and the 1990s. The salient results are: major area of focus has been on the maternal and child care with activities ranging from day-care to in-patient-care; though the number of institutions have grown from 5 to the current day 79, their distribution has been far from satisfactory; Obtaining support from the India Population projects 3 and 8 major upgradarions have been undertaken in terms of infrastructure; Over the years, in addition to the dispensaries of modern system of medicine, local traditional systems have also been initiated; the city has partnered with the healthy cities campaign with mixed success; disease surveillance, addressing the problems related to the emerging non-communicable diseases including mental health and road traffic injuries are still in its infancy. Isolated attempts have been made to address the risks groups of elderly care and adolescent care. What stands out remarkably amongst the cities achievements is its ability to elicit participation from NGOs, CBOs and neighbourhood groups. However, the harnessing of this ability into the health sector cannot be said totally successful. The moot question in all the above observed development are: has the city rationally addressed it planning needs? The progress made so far can be considered as stuttered.

Located in New York, NY and San Francisco, CA, the Overdose Project provides overdose education for social service providers, single-room occupancy hotel (SRO) residents, and syringe exchange participants. The Project also conducts an innovative naloxone prescription program, providing naloxone, an opiate antagonist traditionally administered by paramedics to temporarily reverse the effects of opiate overdose, to injection drug users (IDUs). We will describe how naloxone distribution became a reality in New York and San Francisco, how the Project works, and our results. The naloxone prescription program utilizes multiple models to reach IDUs, including SRO-and street-based trainings, and office-based trainings at syringe exchange sites. Trainings include information on overdose prevention, recognition, and response. A clinician conducts a medical intake with participants and provides them with pre-filled units of naloxone. In New York, funding was initially provided by Tides Foundation. New York City Council provides current funding. New York Department of Mental Health and Hygiene provides program oversight. While the New York project was initiated in June 2004, over half the trainings have been since March 2005. In San Francisco, California Endowment, Tides Foundation, and San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) provide funding. In addition, SFDPH purchases naloxone and provides clinicians who conduct medical intakes with participants. Trainings have been conducted since November 2003. To date, nearly 1000 individuals have been trained and provided with naloxone. Approximately 130 of them have returned for refills and reported that they used naloxone to reverse an opiate-related overdose. Limited episodes of adverse effects have been reported, including vomiting, seizure, and \"loss of friendship.\" In New York, 400 individuals have been trained and provided with naloxone. Over 30 overdose reversals have been reported. Over half of the participants in New York have been trained in the South Bronx, the area of New York with the highest rate of overdose fatalities. In San Francisco, 570 individuals have been trained and provided with naloxone. Over 96 overdose reversals have been reported. The majority of the participants in San Francisco have been trained in the Tenderloin, 6th Street corridor, and Mission, areas with the highest rates of overdose fatalities. The experience of the Overdose Project in both cities indicates that providing IDUs low-threshold access to naloxone and overdose information is a cost-effective, efficient, and safe intervention to prevent accidental death in this population.",

When they do access health care, it is usually for issues severe enough for hospitalization or for episodic care in community clinics. Health promotion and illness prevention is rarely a part of their thinking. Thus, standard public health measures implemented in a more stable population do not work in this group. For example, Pap tests, which have dearly been shown to decrease prevalence of cer\u00b7 vical cancer, are rarely done and when they are, rarely followed up.

The presentation will include project's theoretical basis, methodology, outcomes and evaluation results. Self-help methodology has proven successful in consumer involvement and behaviour modification in \"at risk,\" \"marginalized\" settings. Self-Help is a process of learning with and from each other which provides participants oppor\u00b7 tunities for support in dealing with a problem, issue, condition or need. Self-help groups are mechanisms for the participants to investigate existing solutions and discover alternatives, empowering themselves in this process. Learning dynamic in self-help groups is similar to that of cooperative learning and peertraining, has proven successful, effective and efficient (Haller et al, 2000) . The mutual support provided by participation in these groups is documented as contributory factor in the improved health of those involved. Cognizant of the above theoretical basis, in 2004 the Self-Help Resource Centre initiated the \"Empowering Stroke Prevention Project.\" The project was implemented after the input from 32 health organizations, a scan of more than 300 resources and an in-depth analysis of 52 risk-factor-specific stroke prevention materials indicated the need for such a program. The project objectives were:\u2022 To develop a holistic and empowering health promotion model for stroke prevention that incorporates selfhelp and peer support strategies. \u2022 To develop educational materials that place modifiable risk factors and lifestyle information in a relevant context that validates project participants' life experiences and perspectives.\u2022 To educate members of at-risk communities about the modifiable risk factors associated with stroke, and promote healthy living. To achieve the above, a diverse group of community members were engaged as \"co-editors\" in the development of stroke prevention education materials which reflected and validated their life experiences. These community members received training to become Lay Health Promoters (trained volunteer peer facilitators). In collaboration with local health organizations, these trained lay Health Promoters were then supported in organizing their own community-based stroke prevention activities. In addition, an educational booklet written in plain language, entitled Healthy Ways to Prevent Stroke: A Guide for You, and a companion guide called Healthy Ways to Pre\u00b7 vent Stroke: A Facilitator's Guide were produced. The presentation will include the results of a tw<>tiered evaluation of the program methodology, educational materials and the use of the materials beyond the life of the project. This poster presentation will focus on the development and structure of an innovative street outreach service that assists individuals who struggle mental illness/addictions and are experiencing homelessness. The Mental Health/Outreach Team at Public Health and Community Services (PHCS) of Hamilton, Ontario assists individuals in reconnecting with health and social services. Each worker brings to the ream his or her own skills-set, rendering it extremely effective at addressing the multidimensional and complex needs of clients. Using a capacity building framework, each ream member is employed under a service contract between Public Health and Community Services and a local grassroots agency. There are Public Health Nurses (PHN), two of whom run a street health centre and one of Canada's oldest and most successful Needle Exchange Programs, mental health workers, housing specialists, a harm reduction worker, youth workers, and a United Church Minister, to name a few. A Community Advisory Board, composed of consumers and professionals, advises the Program quarterly. The program is featured on Raising the Roors 'Shared Learnings on Homelessness' website at www.sharedlearnings.ca. Through our poster presentation participants will learn how to create effective partnerships between government and grassroots agencies using a capacity building model that builds on existing programs.",

Their activity is at best dismissed as peripheral eveo, inappropriate retention of peasant culture in cities and at worst illegal and often some-times criminal\u00b7 ized. Urban agriculture is also condemned for its presumed negative health impact. A myth that contin\u00b7 ues despite proof to the contrary is that malarial mosquitoes breed in maize grown in East African towns. However, potential health risks are insignificant compared with the benefits of urban food production. Recent studies too rightly do point to the commercial value of food produced in the urban area while underscoring the importance of urban farming as a survival strategy among the urban poor, especially women-headed households. Since the Millennium Declaration, health has emerged as one of the most serious casualties consequent on the poverty, social exclusion, marginalisation and lack of sustain\u00b7 able development in Africa. HIV/AIDS epidemic poses an unprecedented challenge, while malaria, tuber\u00b7 culosis, communicable diseases of childhood all add to the untenable burden. Malnutrition underpins much ill-health and is linked to more than 50 per cent of all childhood deaths. Kenya's urban poor people ~ace ~ h~ge burde~ of preventable and treatable health problems, measured by any social and bi~ medical md1cator, which not only cause unnecessary death and suffering, but also undermine econonuc development and damage the country's social fabric. The burden is in spite of the availability of suitable tools and re:c=hnology for prevention and treatment and is largely rooted in poverty and in weak healah \u2022rstems. This pa~ therefore challenges development planners who perceive a dichotomy instead of con\u00b7 tmuum between informal and formal urban wage earners in so far as access to health services is con\u00b7 cemed. It i~ this gap that calls for a need to developing and building sustainable health systemS among the urban mformal ~wellers. We recommend a focus on an urban health policy that can build and strengthen the capacity of urban dwellers to access health services that is cost-effective and sustainable. Such ~ health poli<=>: must strive for equity for the urban poor, displaced or marginalized; mobilise and effect1~ely use sufficient sustainable resources in order to build secure health systems and services. Special anenti_on. should ~ afforded HIV/AIDS in view of the unprecedented challenge that this epidemic poses to Africa s economic and social development and to health services on the continent. Methods: A review of the literature led us to construct three simple models and a composite model of exposure to traffic. The data were collected with the help of a daily diary of travel activities using a sample of cyclists who went to or come back from work or study. To calculate the distance, the length of journey, and the number of intersections crossed by a cyclist different Geographic Information Systems (GIS) were operated. Statistical analysis was used to determine the significance between a measure of exposure on the one hand, and the sociodemographic characteristics of the panicipants or their geographic location on the other hand. RestlltJ: Our results indicate that cyclists were significantly exposed to road accidents, no matter of where they live or what are their sociodemographic characteristics. We also stress the point that the fact of having been involved in a road accident was significantly related to the helmet use, but did not reduce the propensity of the cyclists to expose themselves to the road hazards.",

From physical and demographic viewpoints, city growth rates are staggering coupled with gross inabilities to cope with the consequences. Environmental and social ills associated with unguarded rapid urbanization characterize Nigerian cities and threaten urban existence. This paper repons the findings of a recent study of the relationship between environmental health across inrraurban residential communities of Akure, South West Nigeria. It discuses the typical urbanization process of Nigerian cities and its dynamic spatial-temporal characteristics. Physical and socio-demographic attributes as well as the levels and effectiveness of urban infrastructural services are examined across the core residential districts and the elite residential layouts in the town. The incidence rate of cenain environmentally induced tropical diseases across residential neighborhoods and communes is examined. Salient environmental variables that are germane to health procurement in the residential districts, incidence of diseases and diseases parasitology, diseases prevention and control were studied. Field data were subjected to analysis ranging from the univariate and bivariate analysis. Inferential statistics using the chi-square test were done to establish the truthfulness of the guiding hypothesis. Given the above, the study affirms that there is strong independence in the studied communities, between the environment and incidence of diseases hence health of residents of the town. This assertion, tested statistically at the district levels revealed that residents of the core districts have very strong independence between the environment and incidences of diseases. The strength of this relationship however thins out towards the city peripheral districts. The study therefore concludes that since most of the city dwellers live in urban deprivation, urban health sensitive policies must be evolved. This is to cater for the urban dwellers who occupy fringe peripheral sites where the extension of facilities often times are illegally done. Urban infrastructural facilities and services need be provided as a matter of public good for which there is no exclusive consumption or access even for the poorest of the urban poor. Many suffer from low-self esteem, shame and guilt about their drug use. In addition, they often lack suppon or encounter opposition from their panners, family and friends in seeking treatment. These personal barriers are compounded by fragmented addiction, prenatal and social care services, inflexible intake systems and poor communication among sectors. The experience of accessing adequate care between services can be overwhelming and too demanding. The Toronto Centre for Substance Use in Pregnancy (T-CUP) is a unique program developed to minimize barriers by providing Kone-stop\" comprehensive healthcare. T-CUP is a primary care based program located in the department of Family Medicine at St. Joseph\\'s Health Centre, a community teaching hospital in Toronto. The interdisciplinary staff provides prenatal and addiction services, case management, as well as care of newborns affected by substance use. Regular care plan meetings are held between T-CUP, Labour and Delivery nurses and social workers in the Y164 POSTER SESSIONS Maternity and Child Care program. T-CUP also connects \"'.omen with. inpatient treatment programs and community agencies such as Breaking the Cycle, an on-site counselmg group for pregnant substance users.",

            "text": "Introduction: Public health interventions to identify and eliminate health disparities require evidence-based policy and adequate model specification, which includes individuals within a socioecological context, and requires the integration of biosociomedical information. Multiple public and private data sources need to be linked to apportion variation in health disparities ro individual risk factors, the health delivery system, and the geosocial environment. Multilevel mapping of health disparities furthers the development of evidence-based interventions through the growth of the Public Health Information Network (PHIN-CDC) by linking clinical and population health data. Clinical encounter data, administrative hospital data, population socioenvironmental data, and local health policy were examined in a three-level geocoded multilevel model to establish a tracking system for health disparities. NJ has a long established political tradition of \"home rule\" based in 566 elected municipal governments, which are responsible for the well-being of their populations. Municipalities are contained within Counties as defined by the US Census, and health data are linked mostly at the municipality level. Marika Schwandt Community organizers from the Ontario Coaliti~n Again~t Pove~, .along \":ith ~edical practitioners who have endorsed the campaign and have been mvolved m prescnbmg special diet needs for OW and ODSP recipients, will discuss the Raise the Rates campaign. The organizati~n has used a special diet needs supplement as a political tool, meeting the urgent needs o.f .poor ~ople m Toront~ while raising the issues of poverty as a primary determinant of health and nutrtnous diet as a preventative health mea\u00b7 sure. Health professionals carry the responsibility to ensure that they use all means available to them to improve the health of the individuals that they serve, and to prevent future disease and health conditions. Most health practitioners know that those on social assistance are not able to afford nutritious foods or even sufficient amounts of food, but many are not aware of the extra dietary funds that are available aher consideration by a health practitioner. Responsible nurse practitioners and physicians cannot, in good conscience, ignore the special needs diet supplement that is available to all recipients of welfare and disabiliry (OW and ODSP). A number of Toronto physicians have taken the position that all clients can justifiably benefit from vitamins, organic foods and high fiber diets as a preventative health measure. We know that income is one of the greatest predictors of poor health. The special needs diet is a health promotion intervention which will prevent numerous future health conditions, including chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and osteoporosis. Many Communiry Health Centres and other providers have chosen to hold clinics to allow many patients to get signed up for the supplement at one time. Initiated by the Ontario Coalition Against Poverty, these clinics have brought together commu\u00b7 niry organizers, community health centers, health practitioners, and individuals, who believe that poverty is the primary determinant of poor health. We believe that rates must be increased to address the health problems of all people on social assistance, kids, elders, people with HIV/AIDS -everyone. Even in the context of understaffing, it could be considered a priority activity that has potentially important health promotion benefits. Many clients can be processed in a two hour clinic. Most providers find it a very interesting, rewarding undertaking. In 2004 the Ontario Coalition for Social Justice found that a Toronto family with two adults and two kids receives $14,316. This is $21,115 below the poverty line.",

The mortality levels of the Dhaka poor are well above those of the rest of the city's population but much of the difference in death rates is explained by the experience of children, especially infants. Analyzing demographic surveillance data from a large zone of the city containing all sectors of the population, research showed that the one-fifth of the households with the least possessions exhibited U5 child mortality almost three times as high as that recorded by the rest of the population. Why children die in Bangladesh? Because their parents are too poor to provide them with enough food, clean water and other basic needs to help them avoid infection and recover from illness. Researchers believed that girls are more at risk than boys, as mothers regularly feed boys first. This reflects the different value placed on girls and boys, as well as resources which may not stretch far enough to provide for everyone. Many studies show that housing conditions such as household construction materials and access to safe drinking water and hygienic toilet facilities are the most critical determinants of child survival in urban areas of developing countries.

In addition to the local communities there are three populations of focus: the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgendered and Transexual communities (LGBTT); people who are homeless or underhoused; and newcomers to Canada. SHC is dedicated to providing health services in an interdisciplinary manner and its health providers include nurses, a nurse practitioner, mental health counsellors, health promoters, client-resource workers, and physicians. In January 2003 SHC began offering medical care. Among the challenges faced was how to provide responsive, respectful services to the trans community.

In these disadvantaged areas, a large proportion of children do not receive treatment due to inaccessibility to medical services. In these areas, diarrhea, pneumonia, and measles, are the key determinants of infant mortality. Protein energy malnutrition and Vitamin A deficiency persists and communicable diseases are compounded by the emergence of diseases like HIV/AIDS. While the health challenges for disadvantaged populations in Kathmandu are substantial, the city has also experienced various forms of innovative and effective community development health programs. For example, there are community primary health centers established by the Kathmandu Municipality to deliver essential health services to targeted communities. These centers not only provide equal access to health services to the people through an effective management system but also educate them hy organizing health related awareness programs. This program is considered one of the most effective urban health programs. The Paper/Presentation This paper will review large, innovative, and effective urhan health programs that are operating in Kathmandu. Most of these programs are currently run by international and national NGOs",

Unfortunately, some CSHCN do not receive needed eyeglasses or other types of vision care, which pla.:es them at great risk of long-term delays in their educational and social development. .Methods:This cross-sectional analysis was restricted to 14,070 CSHCN who needed v1s10n care. m the previous year. Children who did not receive all the eyeglasses or vision .:are they needed were .:ons1dered to have unmet need for vision care. We estimated the prevalence of unmet need m the populauon overall and in each racial/ethnic group. A multivariate logistic regression model was fi~cd to test the hypothesis that minority CSHCN were more likely than whites to have unmet need for v1s1on care, and odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (Cls) were calculated. R I \u00b7 t whi\"tes increased risks of unmet need for v1s10n care were foun among Afncan to 10. Further research is needed to explain and address the causes of rac1al/ethmc differences in unmet need for vision care among CSHCN.P4-11 (A) Accessibility does not Necessarily Mean Using the Health Facilities Ezzat Mazloomi, M.

            "text": "Introduction and Objectives: Canadians view health as the biggest priority for the federal government, where health policies are often based on models that rely on abstract definitions of health that provide little assistance in the policy and analytical arena. The main objectives of this paper are to provide a functional definition of health, to create a didactic model for devising policies and determining forms of intervention, to aid health professionals and analysts to strategize and prioritize policy objectives via cost benefit analysis, and to prompt readers to view health in terms of capacity measures as opposed to status measures. This paper provides a different perspective on health, which can be applied to various applications of health such as strategies of aid and poverty reduction, and measuring the health of an individual/ community/country. This paper aims to discuss theoretical, conceptual, methodological, and applied implications associated with different health policies and strategies, which can be extended to urban communities. Essentially, our paper touches on the following two main themes of this conference: \u2022Health status of disadvantaged populations; and \u2022Interventions to improve the health of urban communities.Methodology: We initially surveyed other models on this topic, and extrapolated key aspects into our conceptual framework. We then devised a theoretical framework that parallels simple theories of physkal energy, where health is viewed in terms of personal/societal Health Capacities and Effort components.After establishing a theoretical model, we constructed a graphical representation of our model using selfrated health status and life expectancy measures. Ultimately, we formulated a new definition of health, and a rudimentary method of conducting cost benefit analysis on policy initiatives. We end the paper with an application example discussing the issues surrounding the introduction of a seniors program.Results: This paper provides both a conceptual and theoretical model that outlines how one can go about conducting a cost-benefit analysis when implementing a program. It also devises a new definition and model for health barred on our concept of individual and societal capacities. By devising a definition for health that links with a conceptual and theoretical framework, strategies can be more logically constructed where the repercussions on the general population are minimized. Equally important, our model also sets itself up nicely for future microsimulation modeling and analysis.Implications: This research enhances one's ability to conduct community-based cost-benefit analysis, and acts as a pedagogical tool when identifying which strategies provide the best outcome. P7-06 (A) Good Playgrounds are Hard to Find: Parents' Perceptions of Neighbourhood Parks Patricia Tucker, Martin Holmes, Jennifer Irwin, and Jason Gilliland Introduction: Neighbourhood opportunities, including public parks and physical activity or sports fields hav~ been. iden.tified as correlates to physical activity among youth. Increasingly, physical activity among children 1s bemg acknowledged as a vital component of children's lives as it is a modifiable determinant of childh~d obesity. Children's use of parks is mainly under the influence of parents; therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess parents' perspectives of city parks, using London Ontario as a case study.M~~: This qualitative study targeted a heterogeneous sample of parents of children using local parks w1thm London. Parents with children using the parks were asked for 5 minutes of their time and if willing, a s.hort interview was conducted. The interview guide asked parents for their opinion 'of city parks, particularly the one they were currently using.

Las \"formas de hacer, pensar y sentir\" orientan las acciones y delimitan las posibilidades que tienen los individuos de definir que algo es o no problema, asf como tambien los mecanismos de pedido de ayuda.

Methods: Our study was conducted by a team of two researchers at three different sites. The mapping consisted of filling in a chart of observable neighbourhood features such as graffiti, litter, and boarded housing, and the presence or absence of each feature was noted for each city block. Qualitative observations were also recorded throughout the process. Researchers analyzed the compiled quantitative and qualitative neighbourhood data and then analyzed the process of data collection itself.Results: This study reveals the need for further research into the effects of physical environments on individual health and sense of well-being, and perception of investment in neighbourhoods. The process reveals that perceptions of health and safety are not easily quantified. We make specific recommendations about the mapping methodology including the importance of considering how factors such as researcher social location may impact the experience of neighbourhoods and how similar neighbourhood characteristics are experienced differently in various spaces. Further, we discuss some of the practical considerations around the mapping exercise such as recording of findings, time of day, temperature, and researcher safety.Conclusion: This study revealed the importance of exploring conceptions of health and well-being beyond basic physical wellness. It suggests the importance of considering one's environment and one's own perception of health, safety, and well-being in determining health. This conclusion suggests that attention needs to be paid to the connection between the workplace and the external environment it is situated in. The individual's workday experience does not start and stop at the front door of their workplace, but rather extends into the neighbourhood and environment around them. Our procedural observations and recommendations will allow other researchers interested in the effect of urban environments on health to consider using this innovative methodology.",

            "text": "Introduction: Responding ro protests against poor medical attention for sexually assaulted women and deplorable conviction rates for sex offenders, in the late 1970s, the Ontario government established what would become over 30 hospital-based Sexual Assault Care and Treatment Centres (SACTCs) across the province. These Centres, staffed around the clock with specially trained heath care providers, have become the centralized locations for the simultaneous health care treatment of and forensic evidence collection from sexually assaulted women for the purpose of facilitating positive social and legal outcomes. Since the introduction of these Centres, very little evaluative research has been conducted to determine the impact of this intervention. The purpose of our study was to investigate it from the perspectives of sexually assaulted women who have undergone forensic medical examinations at these Centres.Method: Women were referred to our study by SACTC Coordinators across Ontario. We developed an interview schedule composed of both closed and open-ended questions. Twenty-two women were interviewed, face-to-face. These interviews were approximately one-to-two hours in length, and were transcribed verbatim. To date, 19 have been analyzed for key themes.Results: Preliminary findings indicate that most women interviewed were Canadian born (79'Yo), and ranged in age from 17 to 46 years. A substantial proportion self-identified as a visible minority ( 37'X.). Approximately half were single or never married (47%) and living with a spouse or family of origin (53%). Most were either students or not employed (68%). Two-thirds (68%) had completed high school and onethird (37%) was from a lower socio-economic stratum. Almost two-fifths (37%) of women perceived the medical forensic examination as revictimizing citing, for example, the internal examination and having blood drawn. The other two-thirds (63%) indicated that it was an empowering experience, as it gave them a sense of control at a time when they described feeling otherwise powerless. Most (68%) women stated that they had presented to a Centre due to health care concerns and were very satisfied ( 84 % ) with their experiences and interactions with staff. Almost all (89%) women felt supported and understood.Conclusions: This research has important implications for clinical practice and for appropriately addressing the needs of sexually assaulted women. What is apparent is that continued high-quality medical attention administered in the milieu of specialized hospital-based services is essential. At the same time, we would suggest that some forensic evidence collection procedures warrant reevaluation. ",

            "text": "Introdudion: This paper explores the everyday practices of therapeutic programs in the treaDnent of HIV in Vancouver's Inner City. As anthropologists have shown elsewhere, therapeutic programs do not siinply treat physical ailments but they shape, regulate and manage social lives. In Vancouver's Inner City, there are few therapeutic options available for the treatment of 1-IlV. Public health initiatives in the Inner City have instead largely focused on prevention and harm reduction strategies such as needle exchange programs, safe injection sites, and safer-sex education. Epidemiological reports suggest that less than a quarter of those living with HIV in the Downtown Eastside (DTES) are taking antiretroviral therapies raising critical questions regarding the therapeutic economy of antiretrovirals and rights to health care for the urban poor.Methods: This paper is drawn from ethnographic fieldwork in Vancouver's OTES neighborhood focusing on therapeutic programs for HIV treatment among \"hard-to-reach\" populations. The research includes participant-observation at Inner City Health Clinics specializing in the treatment of HIV; semi\u00b7 structured interviews with HIV positive participants, health care professionals providing HIV treatment, and administraton working in the field of Inner City public health; and, lastly, observation at public meetings and conferences surrounding HIV treatment.R.awlts: HIV prevention and treatment is a central concern in the lives of many residents living in the Inner City -although it is just one of many health priorities afflicting the community. Concerns about drug resistance, cost of antiretrovirals, and illicit drug use means that HIV therapy for most is characterized by the daily observation of their medicine ingestion at health clinics or pharmacies. Daily observed treatment (DOT) is increasingly being adopted as a strategy in the therapeutic management of \"untreatable\" populations. DOT programs demand a particular type of subject -one who is \"compliant\" to the rules and regimes of public health. Over emphasis on \"risky practices,\" \"chaotic lives,\" and \"~dh~rence\" preve~ts the public health system from meaningful engagement with the health of the marginalized who continue to suffer from multiple and serious health conditions and who continue to experience considerable disparities in health.~ The ~ffec~s of HIV in the Inner City are compounded by poverty, laclc of safe and affordable houamg, vanous 1llegal underground economies increased rates of violence and outbreaks of ~~~\u00b7~ly tr~nsmitted infections, Hepatitis, and tuberculosi: but this research suggests 'that public health uunauves aimed at reducing health disparities may be failing the most vulnerable and marginal of citiztl1s.",

            "text": "The Mid-Main Community Health Center, located in Vancouver British Columbia (BC), has a diverse patient base reflecting various cultures, languages, abilities, and socio-economic statuses. Due to these differences, some Mid-Main patients experience greater digital divide barriers in accessing computers and reputable, government produced consumer health information (CHI) websites, such as the BC HealthGuide and Canadian Health Network. Inequitable access is problematic because patient empowerment is the basis of many government produced CHI websites. An Internet terminal was introduced at Mid-Main in the summer of 2005, as part of an action research project to attempt to bridge the digital divide and make government produced CHI resources useful to a broad array of patients. Multi-level interventions in co-operation with patients, with the clinic and eventually government ministries were envisioned to meet this goal. The idea of implementing multi-level interventions was adopted to counter the tendency in interactive design to implement a universal solution for the 'ideal' end-user [ 1 ), which discounts diversity. To design and execute the interventions, various action-oriented and ethnographic methods were employed before and during the implementation of the Internet terminal. Upon the introduction of the Internet terminal, participant observation and interviews were conducted using a motion capture software program to record a digital video and audio track of patients' Internet sessions. This research provided insight into the spectrum of patients' capacities to use technology to fulfil their health information needs and become empowered. At the Mid-Main clinic it is noteworthy that the most significant intervention to enhance the usefulness of CHI websites for patients appeared to be a human rather than a technological presence. As demonstrated in other ethnographic research of community Internet access, technical support and capacity building is a significant component of empowerment (2). The Mid-Main wired waiting room project indicates that medical practitioners, medical administrators, and human intermediaries remain integral to making CHI websites useful to patients and their potential empowerment.

Over 71,000 people completed a WfCHR enrollment baseline survey, creating the largest U.S. health registry. While studies have begun to characterize 9/11 bealth impacts, questions on long-term impacts remain that require additional studies involving carefully selected populations, long-term follow-up and appropriate physical exams and laboratory tests. WTCHR provides an exposed population directory valuable for such studies with features that make ita unique resource: (a) a large diverse population of residents, school children/staff, people in lower Man\u00b7 hattan on 9/11 including occupants of damaged/destroyed buildings, and rescue/recovery/cleanup work\u00b7 ers; (b) consent by 91 % of enrollees to receive information about 9/11-related health studies; (c) represenration of many groups not well-studied by other researchers; (c) email addresses of 62% of enrollees; (d) 30% of enrollees recruited from lists with denominator estimates; and (e) available com\u00b7 parison data for NYC residents. WfCHR strives to maintain up-to-date contact information for all enrollees, an interested pool of potential study participants. Follow-up surveys are planned.Methods: To promote the WTCHR as a public health resource, Guidelines for External Researcher.; were developed and posted on (www.wtcregistry.org) which include a short application form, a twopage proposal and documentation of IRB approval. Proposals are limited to medical, public health, or other scientific research. Researchers can request de-identified baseline data or have DOHMH send information about their studies to selected WfCHR enrollees via mail or email. Applications are scored by the WTCHR Review Committee, comprised of representatives from DOHMH, the Agency for Toxic Subst~nces and Disease Registry, and WTCHR's scientific, community and labor advisory committees. A data file users manual will be available in early Fall 2005.~suits: Three external applications have been approved in 2005, including one &om a non-U.S. ~esearcher, all requesting information to be sent to selected WTCHR enrollees. The one completed mail\u00b7 mg~~ WTCHR enrollee~ (o 3,700 WfC tower evacuees) generated a positive survey response rate. Three additional researchers mtend to submit applications in 2005. WfCHR encourages collaborations between researchers and labor and community leaders.Conclusion: Studies involving WTCHR enrollees will provide vital information about the long\u00b7 term health consequences of 9/11.

In Toronto, we are piloting syndromic data from the 911 \u00b7 Emergency Medical Services (EMS) database to examine how this information can be used on an ongoing basis for the early detection of syndromes including heat-related illness (HRI), and influenza-like-illness (Ill).

Introduction: There is strong evidence that primary care interventions, including screening, brief advi<:e, treatment referral and pharmacotherapy are effective in reducing morbidity and mortality caused by substance abuse. Yet physicians are poor at intervening with substance users, in part because of lack of time, training and support.

The program will have three components: Education, office systems and clinical shared care. As opposed to a traditional consult service, the patient will be booked with both a Primary Care Liaison Worker (PCL) and Addictions Physician. Patients referred from community physicians, the emergency department and inpatient medical and psychiatric wards will be recruited for the study as well as PCPs from the surrounding community. The target sample size is 100-150 physicians and a similar number of patients. After initial consult, patient will be recruited into the study with their consent. The shared-case model underlines the interaction and collaboration with the patient's main PCP. ASC will provide them with telephone consults, advice, support and re-assessment for their patients, as well as educational sessions and materials such as newsletters and informational kits.Results: The impact of this transition on our patient care and on PCP's satisfaction with the ASC model is currently being evaluated through a grant provided by the Ministry of Health & Long Term Care. A retrospective chart review will be conducted using information on the patient's substance use, ER/clinic visits, and their health/mood status. PCP satisfaction with the program will be measured through surveys and focus groups. Our cost-effectiveness analysis will calculate the overall cost of the program per patient..Conclusion: This low-cost service holds promise to serve as an optimal model and strategy to improve outcomes and reduce health care utilization in addict patients.",

            "text": "Building a Caring Community Old Strathcona's Whyte Avenue, a district in Edmonton, brought concern about increases in the population of panhandlers, street people and homeless persons to the attention of all levels of government. The issue was not only the problems of homelessness and related issues, but feelings of insecurity and disempowerment by the neighbourhood residents and businesses. Their concerns were acknowledged, and civic support was offered, but it was up to the community itself to solve the problem. Within a year of those meetings, an Adult Outreach Worker program was created. The Outreach worker, meets people in their own environments, including river valley camps. She provides wrap-around services rooted in harm reduction and health promotion principles. Her relationship-based practice establishes the trust for helping clients with appropriate housing, physical and/or mental health issues, who have little or no income and family support to transition from homelessness. The program is an excellent example of collaboration that has been established with the businesses, community residents, community associations, churches, municiple services, and inner-city agencies such as Boyle Street Community Services. Statistics are tracked using the Canadian Outcomes Research Institute HOMES database, and feedback from participants, including people who are street involved. This includes an Annual General Meeting for community and people who are homeless. The program's holistic approach to serving the homeless population has been integral, both in creating community awareness and equipping residents and businesses to effectively interact with people who are homeless. Through this community development work, the outreach worker engages Old Strathcona in meeting the financial and material needs of the marginalized community. The success of this program has been surprising -the fact is that homeless people's lives are being changed; one person at a time and the community has been changed in how they view and treat those without homes. Over two years, the program has successfully connected with approximately seventy-five individuals who call Old Strathcona home, but are homeless. Thirty-six individuals are now in homes, while numerous others have been assisted in obtaining a healthier and safer lifestyles by becoming connected with other social/health agencies. The program highlights the roots of homelessness, barriers to change and requirements for success. It has been a thriving program and a model that works by showing how a caring community has rallied together to achieve prosperous outcomes.

For example, the mes, c1v1c orgamza 10 , . \u00b7 b TB d' \u00b7 SPN has established a system with pharmaceutical companies that help patients to uy me 1cmes at a special discounted rate. This scheme also allows patients to get a free one-_month's worth of~ dru_g supply if they purchase the first 5 months of their regimen. The sy_s~e~s were ~es1gned to be cm~pattble with eXISting policies for recording and documentation of the Ph1hppme National Tuberculosis Program (NTP). Aside from that, stakeholders were also encouraged to be DOTS-enabled through the use of m~nual~ and on-line training courses. The SPN initiative offers an alternative in easing the burden of TB sc:rv1ce delivery from rhe public sector through the harnessing of existing private-sector (DSOs). The learnmgs from the SPN experience would benefit groups from other locales that _work no~ only on ~ but other health concerns as well. The SPN experience showcases how well-coordinated private sector involvements help promote social justice in health delivery in urban communities.P7-63 (C) Young People in Control; Doing It Safe. The Safe Sex Comedy Juan Walter and Pepijn v. Empelen Introduction: High prevalence of chlamydia and gonorrhoea have been reported among migrants youth in Amsterdam, originating from the Dutch Antilles, Suriname and Sub-Sahara Africa. In addition, these groups also have high rates of teenage-pregnancy (Stuart, 2002) and abortions (Rademakers 1995), indicating unsafe sexual behaviour of these young people. Young people (aged 12 -30) from the so\u00b7 called Urban Scene (young trendsetters in R&B/hip hop music and lifestyle) in Amsterdam have been approached by the Municipal Health Service (MHS) to collaborate on a safe sex project. Their input was to use comedy as vehicle to get the message a cross. For the MHS this collaboration was a valuable opportunity to reach a hard-to-reach group.Mdhods: First we conducted a need assessment by means of a online survey to assess basic knowledge and to similtaneously examine issues of interest concerning sex, sexuality, safer sex and the opposite sex. Second, a small literature study was conducted about elements and essential conditions for succesful entertainment & education (E&E) (Bouman 1999), with as most important condition to ensure that the message is realistic (Buckingham & Bragg, 2003) . Third a program plan was developed aiming at enhancing the STl/HIV and sexuality knowledge of the young people and addressing communication and educational skills, by means of drama. Subsequently a safe sex comedy show was developed, with as main topics: being in love, sexuality, empowerment, stigma, STI, HIVand safer sex. The messages where carried by a mix of video presentation, stand up comedy, spoken word, rap and dance.Results: There have been two safe sex comedy shows. The attendance was good; the group was divers' with an age range between 14 and 50 year, with the majority being younger than 25 year. More women than men attended the show. The story lines were considered realistic and most of the audients recognised the situations displayed. Eighty percent of the audients found the show entertaining and 60% found it edm:arional. From this 60%, one third considers the information as new. Almost all respondents pointed our that they would promote this show to their friends.Con.clusion: The s.h<_>w reached the hard-to-reach group of young people out of the urban scene and was cons1d_ered entert~mmg, educational and realistic. In addition, the program was able in addressing important ISSues, and impacted on the percieved personal risk of acquiring an STI when not using condoms, as well as on basic knowledge about STl's. Introduction: Modernity has contributed mightily to the marginality of adults who live with mental illnesses and the subsequent denial of opportunities to them. Limited access to social, vocational, educational, and residential opportunities exacerbates their disenfranchisement, strengthening the stigma that has been associated with mental illness in Western society, and resulting in the denial of their basic human rights and their exclusion from active participation in civil society. The clubhouse approach tn recovery has led to the reduction of both marginality and stigma in every locale in which it has been implemented judiciously. Its elucidation via the prism of social justice principles will lead to a deeper appreciation of its efficacy and relevance to an array of settings.",

            "text": "Methods: A review of the literature on social justice and mental health was conducted to determine core principles and relationships between the concepts. In particular, Fondacaro and Weinberg's (2002) conceptualization of social justice in community psychology suggests the desirability of the clubhouse approach in community mental health practice. A review of clubhouse philosophy and practice has led to the inescapable conclusion that there is a strong connection between clubhouse philosophy-which represents a unique approach co recovery--and social justice principles. Placing this highly effective model of community mental health practice within the context of these principles is long overdue. Via textual analysis, we will glean the principles of social justice inherent in the rich trove of clubhouse literature, particularly the International Standards of Clubhouse Development.Results: Fondacarao and Weinberg highlight three primary social justice themes within their community psychology framework: prevention and health promotion; empowerment, and a critical pnsp<\"<\u00b7tive. Utilizing the prescriptive principles that inform every detail of clubhouse development and th<\" movement toward recovery for individuals at a fully-realized clubhouse, this presentation asserts that both clubhouse philosophy and practice embody these social justice themes, promote human rights, and empower clubhouse members, individuals who live with mental illnesses, to achieve a level of wdl-heing and productivity previously unimagined.Conclusion: A social justice framework is critical to and enhances an understanding of the clubhouse model. This model creates inclusive communities that lead to opportunities for full partic1pil!ion 111 civil society of a previously marginalized group. The implication is that clubhouses that an\u00b7 based on the International Standards for Clubhouse Programs offer an effective intervention strategy to guarantee the human rights of a sizable, worthy, and earnest group of citizens. to a drastic increase in school enrollment from 5.9 million in 2002 to 7.5 million in 200.S.

            "text": "Methods: The study utilizes quantitative and qualitative schooling data from the longitudinal health and demographic study being implemented by the African Population and Health Research Center in two informal settlements in Nairobi. Descriptive statistics are used to depict trends in enrollment rates for children aged 5-19 years in slum settlements for the period 2000-2005. Results: The results show that school enrollment has surprisingly steadily declined for children aged 15-19 while it increased marginally for those aged 6-14. The number of new enrollments (among those aged 5 years) did not change much between 2001 and 2004 while it declined consistently among those aged 6-9 since 2002. These results show that the underlying reasons for poor school attendance in poverty-stricken populations go far beyond the lack of school fees. Indeed, the results show that lack of finances (for uniform, transportation, and scholastic materials) has continued to be a key barrier to schooling for many children in slums. Furthermore, slum children have not benefited from FPE because they mostly attend informal schools since they do not have access to government schools where the policy is being implemented.Conclusion: The results show the need for equity considerations in the design and implementation of the FPE program in Kenya. Without paying particular attention to the schooling needs of the urban poor children, the millennium development goal aimed at achieving universal primary education will remain but a pipe dream for the rapidly increasing number of children living in poor urban neighborhoods.PS-04 (C) Programing for HIV/AIDS in the Urban Workplace: Issues and Insights Joseph Kamoga HIV/AIDS has had a major effect on the workforce. according to !LO 35million persons who are engaged in some form of production are affectefd by HIV/AIDS. The working class mises out on programs that take place in communities, yet in a number of jobs, there are high risks to HIV infection. working persons sopend much of their active life time in workplaces and that is where they start getting involved in risky behaviour putting entire families at risk. And when they are infected with HIV, working people face high levels of seclusion, stigmatisation and some miss out on benefits especially in countries where there are no strong workplace programs. Adressing HIV/AIDS in the workplace is key for sucessfull responses. This paper presents a case for workplace programing; the needs, issues and recommendations especially for urban places in developing countries where the private sector workers face major challenges.",
