Various synonyms for this type of infection are used, often due to the difficult diagnosis. Necrotizing fasciits of the extremities is found after simple skin lacerations and often in rural, farming or garden setting environments. Many of the infections are found in immunologically healthy people, but persons revealing a compromised wound healing are endangered additionally, e.g., diabetes. In the majority of the microbiological analyses, streptococci alone or a mixture with mainly anaerobic bacteria may be detected. The management of infected extremities requires a rapid diagnosis, dedicated aggressive surgical management as soon as possible, and a wide debridement extending the border of the infected fascia. Timely surgical revisions within the first day or days together with antibiotic treatment are the only measures to stop the infection. Depending on the status of the patient a hyperbaric oxygenation treatment seems to be useful in order to limit the infection. In fulminated cases early amputations, maximal intensive care treatment of the septic patient are required, where all means are warranted to save the patients life. As a consequence, early clinical diagnoses with thorough surgical debridement of the infected liquid necrotic fascia as well as correct antibiotic treatment are needed.

It was first described by Hippocrates in the fifth century as erysipelas [1] . In the eighteenth century a detailed description of NF was provided by British naval physicians and in the early nineteenth century, it was named as gangrenous ulcer, putrid ulcer, malignant ulcer, phagedenic ulcer, phagedena, and phagedena gangrenosa and hospital gangrene [2] . In 1871, during the civil war, J. Jones, an American Surgeon, mentioned more than 2,000 cases very possible NF. Afterwards Pfanner described in 1818 in the German medical literature the clinical picture of necrotizing erysipelas and found streptococci related to the disease [3, 4] . In 1924, Meleney used the name hemolytic streptococcal gangrene [5] . Since then, various names have been given to NF (Table 1) . Finally, in 1952, Wilson used the term necrotizing fasciitis (NF).

In patients suffering from NF, more often diabetes, hypertonic blood pressure, arterial occlusive disease, and obesity are found as well as higher percentage of alcohol and drug abuse, immunosuppressant therapy and HIVinfections. Even a varicella zoster virus infection in combination with the use of NSAIDs is discussed as risk factor [9] . It is more likely to appear in elderly people, but children also can be affected. In the literature various reasons have been related to the primary focus and include minor skin lesions, bites of insects and wounds after surgical procedures [10] .

This is characterized by a systemic sepsis with multiple organ failure, especially the kidney. Today, NF caused by streptococci group A is classified as a subgroup of this infection. Also myositis caused by streptococcimostly due to direct inoculation/contaminationshould be differentiated. In such cases rapid lyses of the involved muscle, with edema formation, focal development of a compartment syndrome with consecutive necrosis is observed [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Therefore necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI's) characterize various diseases. Clinically they can be separated in superficial infections involving cutis/subcutis and deep infections affecting fascia and muscle (NF, myositis). These deep infections are further classified as type I (polymicrobial) and type II (monomicrobial). Bacterial factors play an important role in NSTI. In the cases of invasive streptococcal infections, surface proteins (M1, M3) increase adhesion and prevent phagocytosis and exotoxines (A, B, C, streptococci super-antigen) induce the release of cytokines and could bind to T-cell receptors causing further release of TNF-a, IL-1 and IL-6 ending in a STSS [17, 18] . Although M-types 1 and 3 are common other types have been isolated in invasive infections; however, a stable genetic change was observed in M-type 1 group A streptococci in the 1980s, resulting in its ability to produce nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide glycohydrolase (NADase) and might be one factor in severe invasive infections [19] . The rapid tissue destruction is a result of toxin-induced vascular occlusion. As the infection progresses more toxins are produced and tissue destroyed.

Renal impairment precedes hypotension, as well as hypoalbuminemia and hypocalcemia are early signs. Especially in the extremities the bacteria are inoculated mostly through a minor skin lesion. The infection is in the early stage characterized by un-proportional local pain due to fascia necrosis. After this, skin changes are visible with edema and erythema ( Figure 1 ). The typical pattern of skin necrosis with or without blisters is found later; however, the necrosis generally spreads rapidly in the proximal direction. The necrosis of the fascia has already much further spread, compared to the changes of the skin ( Figure 2 ).

MRI has some impact due to soft tissue and multiplanar imaging and might be helpful in case the source of infection lies deep inside the body. During surgery an excision biopsy could be done, but the typical discoloration of the fascia (yellow to green) and the possibility to manually dissect the fascia (like chewing gum) will assure the diagnosis.

The only surgical option is the radical surgical excision of the infected subcutaneous tissue in particular including the grey pale fascia. In these cases, the fascia is grey, has lost all its strength and can more or less be pealed off. It is essential to resect the infected fascia and to debride into healthy tissue. Furthermore, it is essential to follow up by surgical re-interventions after a short time -even again on the same day in fulminant cases or at least the subsequent day. In general this regime is followed a few days until the spreading in the proximal direction has been stopped. An amputation in the extremities is not the primary treatment, but in cases where the whole tissue is necrotic and most muscles involved, this might be the only option to stop further spreading and systemic sepsis with multiple organ failure. These amputations have to be performed as open amputations, again requiring second look operation and secondary closure.

A combination-therapy adds vancomycin, linezolid or daptomycin to a carbapenem or b-lactam/ b-lactamase inhibitor combination, if methicilin-resistant staphylococci are possible. Another combination therapy includes penicillin, clindamycin and fluoroquinolone or aminogycoside to cover Gram-negative bacteria. In a case of streptococcal infection clindamycin should be included into the medication, since it has been shown to inhibit the toxin production (m-protein and exotoxin) in severe cases [21] . Especially streptolycin O (SLO) induces changes to the leukocytes. It is specific to phenoloxidase important in the mechanism of host defense and much reduced in NF-cases due to streptococci infection. This significant immunosuppressive effect is accompanied by the effect that phenoloxidase catalyses the transformation of tyrosine to dehydroxy-phenylalanine necessary to produce catecholamine, one reason a patient with NF might need catecholamine substitution. Additionally, some immunotherapies (e.g., immunoglobulins) are also suggested by some authors [13] .

Other effects related to this treatment are vasoconstriction, reduced leukocyte sequestration, lipid peroxidation, free radical scavenging and reduction of tissue edema resulting in an increased tissue perfusion/microcirculation [28] [29] [30] . Another important effect, thought to be helpful in treating NF by improving host defense, is the activation of leukocytes. Also reparative processes might be stimulated due to fibroblast migration, proliferation and collagen synthesis [22, 31, 32] . These effects might be very helpful to support healing/granulation tissue formation of these mostly difficult wounds [33] . Various treatment regimes are recommended to be followed-up; however the most intense is that in accordance with crush injury with three treatments within the first 48 hours (2-2.5 ATA, 1-2 h O 2breathing), followed by two treatments the next 48 h and finally 48 h once a day. Since the use of HBOtreatment is connected with high medical and technical expenditure, especially if the patient is critically ill due to sepsis and needs breathing support, estimation is necessary, also the literature is controversial about the effects on morbidity and mortality rates [12, 34, 35] . However, this therapy needs to be considered focusing an increasing network and therapeutic standard in HBO-Treatment. Another possibility to increase oxygen in the body is an intravenous application (Regelsberger's intravenous Oxygen Therapy).

The type 2 infections are less common, but are more often found in the case of the involvement of extremities. Every fascia in the body can be destroyed by this disease. Early diagnosis is critical to the survival of the patient and must rely on the clinical picture. When there is doubt, there should be no delay in performing surgery with radical debridement. The suggested treatment strategy with adequate early surgical and intensive care medicine could help reduce the up to 70% lethality rate, as stated in some publications, to less than 10% [40] [41] [42] . Infections of the extremities are less likely lethal, whereas an intra-abdominal occurrence leads mostly to the death of the patient. Higher age, diabetes, arterial occlusive disease, immunosuppressant status and the onset of NF due to iatrogenic infections is linked to a much worse prognosis.
