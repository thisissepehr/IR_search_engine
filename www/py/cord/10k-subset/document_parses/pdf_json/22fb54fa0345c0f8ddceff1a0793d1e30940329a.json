Seven mosquito-borne viruses belonging to three families, the Flaviviridae, Bunyaviridae and Alphaviridae, were recorded across the DRC. Among the Flaviviridae, four species, YFV, DENV, ZIKV and WNV, were recorded. Among the Alphaviridae, two species, CHIKV and ONNV were reported. The recorded mosquito-borne viruses occurred either during an outbreak investigation, immediately after an outbreak, or occasionally during inter-epidemic periods. Most of the records were related to YFV and CHIKV. A number of studies were carried during colonial era before 1960 and around the beginning of the country's independence in 1960. Most of the reports on mosquito-borne diseases were published between 1998 and 2018 (Fig. 2 ). Only two recent entomological studies were recorded in DRC, one study on Aedes fauna in Kinshasa [12] and another one on mosquito virus infectivity [13] . These viruses were identified using different diagnostic methods ranging from serological investigation [animal inoculation, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western blot, plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT)], morphological investigation of affected organs, tissue culture cell lines (Vero, C6/36) and molecular biological methods including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection, genome sequencing and molecular genetics analysis. The majority of sample specimens analysed were from humans; few were from animals and mosquitoes. Some studies reported co-occurrence or co-infections of mosquitoborne viruses.

Ten years later, Ae. aegypti predominated during the second yellow fever outbreak in Matadi and neighbouring townships [17] , while in Gemena, Ae. simpsoni and Ae. aegypti were found in proportions of 90% and 10%, respectively during these outbreaks [18] . In the Bongo and Ango territories, where many mosquito-borne viruses reports are documented, Ae. aegypti predominated Ae. simpsoni [32] .

The overall geographical distribution of both mosquito-borne viruses and their potential vectors species seemed to be influenced by climate distribution pattern in DRC.

Indeed, the northern regions are experiencing an equatorial climate with rain throughout the year. From the central region to western region the climate is tropical with long rains, while in eastern and southern regions the climate is tropical but semi-arid. The Congo Basin has warmed between 0.2-0.3 \u00b0C per decade and reached 1 \u00b0C in 1992. The average annual precipitation has declined by 8-12% from 1960 to 1998. Climate change is manifested in DRC by short periods of heavy rainfall leading to multiple flooding events followed by early droughts [49, 50] . This considerable fluctuation in the climate regime causing either drought or flooding has an influence on vector abundance and diversity [51] . Most probably, heavy rainfalls are creating suitable mosquito breeding habitats, hence transmission of mosquito-borne viruses. Nevertheless, due to climate variability and increasing population movements, these mosquito species might establish successfully over time and change this general trend. Although, there is evidence of ZIKV, DENV and RVFV circulation in DRC, no epidemic has been reported so far. This review indicates that there is a dearth of information as regards to vector and transmission indices of mosquito-borne viral infections in DRC. This underlines the importance of better identification of different local vectors in each region or specific area within regions, and to assess competence of the vectors to transmit mosquito-borne viruses. Intensive deforestation activities in Gemena city provided an opportunity for mosquitoborne viruses to emerge [18] . It is likely because of the degradation of the forest habitats during these activities, Aedes mosquitoes invaded the city and successfully established in their new habitats closer to humans, leading to a high human mosquito biting rate in a deforested area. Indeed, the increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due to deforestation warms up the climate and causes changes in rainfall patterns leading to conditions of flood or drought. The establishment of new suitable habitats is creating an opportunity for new mosquito species to proliferate [52] . This is in corroboration with observations from Brazil, where deforestation has been involved in sylvatic yellow fever outbreaks [53] . It was reported that mosquitoes which are known to be zoophilic and sylvatic have invaded the peridomestic and periurban settlements and started to feed on humans [53] . Similar observations from the Ivory Coast illustrated the impact of land-use modifications on the abundance, distribution, and hostseeking behaviour of Aedes mosquitoes [54] . A study in the Amazon concluded that deforestation is responsible for the increase in malaria incidence [55] . This observation could emphasize the impact of significant deforestation observed across the DRC in relation to the emergence of mosquito-borne viral diseases and repeated outbreaks in the country. There is currently a need to investigate the impact of environmental factors and the role of climate change on current mosquito-borne virus geographical distribution and predicting potential distribution in the future.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 55, "end": 59, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 86, "end": 90, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 91, "end": 95, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 96, "end": 100, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 101, "end": 105, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 106, "end": 110, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 111, "end": 115, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 668, "end": 672, "text": "[49,", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 673, "end": 676, "text": "50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 817, "end": 821, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1697, "end": 1701, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2252, "end": 2256, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 2388, "end": 2392, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2558, "end": 2562, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2734, "end": 2738, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2845, "end": 2849, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Climate change influences the frequency of mosquitoborne disease occurrence by affecting host and vector diversity, abundance, genetics and the pathogen infection load in the host and vector.

Considering the largest cattle population in eastern DRC, the situation represents a real health threat that needs more attention.

Environmental and climate factors, human activities and population movement are likely contributing enormously to the emergence and re-emergence of mosquitoborne viruses.
