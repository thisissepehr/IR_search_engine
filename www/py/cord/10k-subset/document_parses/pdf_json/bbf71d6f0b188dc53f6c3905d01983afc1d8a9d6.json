In this type of transplant, the inclusion of liver/duodenum/pancreas is a way of preserving the hepatic hilus and biliary tree; therefore, there is no need for biliary reconstructive procedures, decreasing the risks for donor-related vascular or biliary complications [28] (Fig. 3) .

Early introduction of feeds is important to stimulate gut hormones, so the general rule is to initiate low volume feeds, reduced in fat and low in osmolality, and slowly increase volume until full feeds are reached. There is then a transition to bolus feeds. Formula preference, including polymeric or elemental feeds, varies between centers. Due to manipulation of lymphatics during the surgery, it is suggested to avoid long chain triglycerides until 4-6 weeks. As oral aversion is common in many of these patients, almost 45 % of patients depend on enteral tube feeding for nutritional support for the first 2 years after transplantation [33] . If a patient does not have oral aversion, the diet should consist of low fat, low simple carbohydrates and low osmolality.

Eighty percent of immune cells normally reside in gut and they are repopulated with recipient cells after transplantation; however, the genotype of the epithelium remains largely that of the donor, making the organ highly chimeric and immunogenic [35] , with a higher likelihood of both acute and chronic rejection. Other than strict electrolyte and fluid management to maintain optimal organ perfusion in the immediate postoperative period, the main concern in the early postoperative course is the development of acute cellular rejection (ACR), which is a cellular and humoral immune-mediated allograft injury, that can occur in up to 50 % of patients and more frequently during the first 90 days post transplantation. Clinically, it can manifest in multiple ways including high stoma output, bloody diarrhea, fever and abdominal pain, amongst other symptoms and early recognition and treatment are crucial to ensure patient and graft survival. The exact mechanism of rejection is not yet well understood; however, there have been advances in the understanding of gut immunology during rejection, allowing better, targeted immunosuppression therapy. A recent study by Ningappa et al., demonstrated that among 107 differentially expressed genes, three B cell lineage-specific genes, CCR10, STAP1, and IGLL1, were down-regulated during ITx rejection and were selected for and achieved technical quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction replication. Down-regulation of the immunoglobulin (Ig)A? plasma cell-specific CCR10 gene correlated with decreased mature mucosal CD138? plasma cell numbers in corresponding biopsy specimens (r = 0.761, p = 0.006) and inversely correlated with enhanced allo-reactivity of CD154? T-cytotoxic memory cells (r = -0.56, p = 0.031), that predict acute cellular rejection with high sensitivity, concluding that protracted depletion of the mucosal CD138? plasma cell barrier and early mucosal infiltration with memory IgG? cells characterize the rejection-prone intestine allograft and that mucosal IgA? plasma cell barrier reconstitution may augment resolution of ITx rejection [36] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 292, "end": 296, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2174, "end": 2178, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Acute rejection"}, {"text": "To screen for ACR, patients are left with an ileostomy to have access to frequent intestinal biopsy samples.

The mainstay for prophylaxis is to receive intravenous ganciclovir and CMV immune globulin for 3-12 months post IT with routine screening of serum CMV PCR.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 334, "end": 338, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 660, "end": 664, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Infections"}, {"text": "PTLD is a proliferative disorder of B-lymphocytes driven by EBV.

Few studies have addressed QOL after IT. Peroni et al. in 2012 published data from a preliminary cross sectional study assessing QOL on home parenteral nutrition and after intestinal transplantation using comparable questionnaires. The treatment-specific quality of life questionnaire for adult patients on home parenteral nutrition was adapted for intestinal transplant recipients. Both instruments were composed of 8 functional scales, 9 symptom scales, 3 global health status/quality of life scales and 2 single items. Intestinal transplant recipients showed a better score in following scales: ability to holiday/travel (p \\ 0.001), fatigue (p = 0.022), gastrointestinal symptoms (p \\ 0.001), stoma management/bowel movements (p = 0.001) and global health status/quality of life (p = 0.012). A better score for ability to eat/drink (p = 0.070) and a worse score for sleep pattern (p = 0.100) after intestinal transplantation were also observed [53] . A recent study published by Andres et al. in 2014 aimed to determine Health related quality of life (HRQOL) after pediatric intestinal transplantation. Thirtyone IT survivors from 1999 to 2012 were asked to complete age-specific HRQOL non-disease-specific questionnaires: TAPQOL (0-4 year), Revidierter Kinder Lebensqualitatsfragebogen (KINDL-R) (5-7; 8-12; 13-17 year), and SF-36v2 ([18 year). The primary caregivers completed a SF-36 questionnaire and Caregiver Burden Interview (CBI). Highest scores were obtained for vitality (group I), self-esteem (group IV), and physical and social functioning and emotions (group V). Lowest scores were obtained in appetite and behavior (I), family and school (III), and chronic disease perception (III, IV). No significant differences were found between caregivers and their children. CBI showed stress in 52 %. SF-36 for caregivers was lower than the general population. No significant differences were found depending on relevant clinical and socio-demographic data. HRQOL was acceptable and improved with age and time since transplantation. It seems that parents have a slightly worse perception of their childs health and also worse perception or their own QOL compared to the general population, and attention should also be paid to them. These results support the idea that when successful, intestinal transplantation allows a more normal life in most patients and can be offered as an attractive option, as patients are able to join society and perform age-appropriate activities and occupation [54] . The cost of home total parenteral nutrition versus intestinal transplantation is similar during the first year after intestinal transplantation. The incidence of re-hospitalization appears two to threefold more common after transplantation than for patients on PN; however, beyond the first year, the yearly cost of hospitalization and immunosuppressive medication is less after transplantation than the cost of continued PN. This suggests that, if a patient maintains a functional graft, intestinal transplantation becomes cost effective within 1-3 years after the procedure [55] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1184, "end": 1188, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2735, "end": 2739, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 3318, "end": 3322, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Quality of life"}, {"text": "Intestinal transplantation (IT) is the least common form of organ transplantation, however, there has been progress in patient and graft survival rates over the past decade. It remains on the continuum of care for pediatric patients with intestinal failure, but bowel transplant rates have declined worldwide over the last 6 years, in large part due to the development of multidisciplinary intestinal rehabilitation programs and the control of progressive cholestatic liver disease with novel lipid-based management strategies. With improved clinical outcomes of pediatric patients with intestinal failure, there is increasing evidence that the current indications for bowel transplantation no longer apply and need revision. The role of bowel transplantation may be changing in pediatric intestinal failure, but it remains an important option. All intestinal rehabilitation programs should have a close and fluid relationship with an intestinal transplant program to ensure early referral and assessment as necessary. The ultimate goal of management of patients with IF is to achieve enteral autonomy and wean PN, reduce mortality, minimize co-morbidity and optimize quality of life. Fortunately, most pediatric patients with IF will eventually become enterally autonomous due to inherent gut growth potential, but some may not, or may develop progressive complications and transplantation is most appropriate [56] . Unfortunately, there has been little advance in long-term survival related to chronic rejection, infection and PTLD.
