We report that the number of memory (i.e., CD44 hi ) T cells within the CD8 subset is correlated with number of memory cells in the CD4 population, and inversely correlated with the number of naive (i.e., CD45RB hi ) CD4 cells at both 6 and 11 months of age, suggesting that the conversion of naive to memory cells may occur at similar rates in both T cell subsets. Mice that ranked high in the proportion of memory T cells (within the CD4 and CD8 pools) at 6 months of age tended to retain their ranking at 11 months, suggesting that the pace or extent of memory cell formation may be a consistent trait that distinguishes mice at least within a genetically heterogeneous population. Mice that at 6 months of age exhibited high levels ofCD4 or CD8 memory T cells, low levels of naive CD4 cells, or low levels ofT cells able to proliferate in response to Con A and 1L-2 were found to be significantly more likely than their littermates to die within the first 18 months of life. Cases offollicular cell lymphoma, lymphocytic and lymphoblastic lymphoma, and hepatic hemangiosarcoma were seen within the group of mice dying at early ages.

In principle, one could test the hypothesis that immune decline increases disease susceptibility by a longitudinal analysis, in which individuals are tested for one or more age-sensitive indices of immune competence at a relatively early age, i.e., at an age at which interindividual differences in immune function are unlikely to be the result of latent illness, and then followed until their natural death to see if any of the early or mid-life immune status tests were able to predict remaining longevity or disease incidence. Such an analysis is, in general, impractical in humans, for whom many decades of follow-up would be needed.

Furthermore, even in the AKR model, in which spontaneous lymphoma leads to death within 8-12 months of age, there seems to be no effect on T cell responsiveness until very late in the lymphomagenic progression (Zatz et al., 1973; Collavo et al., 1975) . \"Hidden neoplasms\" hypothetically present at 6 months of age would have to exhibit a very unusual set of properties.

The idea that the immunodeficiency of aging contributes to the 5th-power relationship between age and cancer incidence is controversial, and deserves to be; the various arguments have been explored more fully in recent reviews (Ershler, 1993; Miller, 1991c Miller, , 1993 . The incidence and the rate of development of lymphocyte malignancies in mice are under complex, multi-genic control (Lilly and Pincus, 1973; Steeves and Lilly, 1977) . Some of the genetic loci are known to encode endogenous retroviruses, and others to control the ability of these viruses to infect cells from mice of different genotypes, but still others are thought to alter the parameters of host response, potentially including immunological defences. Two of the four grandparental strains, AKR/J and SJL/J, are known to be highly prone to early life hematologic malignancy, but in each case tumor susceptibility is controlled by sets of genes at least some of which are recessive. Fewer than 10% of the (SLJ x A.SW)F1 hybrid mice develop the tumor typical of their SJL parent (Bubbers, 1984) , while Fl progeny of AKR mice experience a leukemia incidence of approximately 17%, with the leukemia incidence of F2 and F3 crosses diminished in proportion to the logarithm of the proportion of AKR genotype (Lilly and Pincus, 1973) . At least one of these genes, Rgv-1, maps to the K end of H-2 and regulates lymphoma development through mechanisms that are still not fully understood (Lilly and Pincus, 1973) but which may well involve altered immunity. Another group, studying the delayed development of lymphoma in AKR mice congenic for the H-2 b allele of C57L, has suggested that the stronger T cell immune response of the AKR.H2 b strain may contribute to its relative resistance to AKR-type lymphoma (Johnson et al., 1980) . The idea that altered levels of immune function may strongly influence susceptibility to spontaneous tumor development is further supported by the work of Covelli and his colleagues on the genetically heterogeneous lines of mice originally bred by Biozzi (Covelli et al., 1985 (Covelli et al., , 1989 . This group has shown that selection over many generations for high (or alternately low) levels of early life humoral immunity can produce lines of genetically heterogeneous mice that differ not only in immune response but also in life span and age-adjusted tumor incidence. The populations bred for higher early immunity exhibit lower tumor incidence and longer life span. A similar relationship is observed among populations (Fl, F2, and backcross) with differing genetic contributions from the high immune, long-lived parental stock, and furthermore also among individual mice within the heterogeneous F2 and backcross segregants (Covelli et al., 1989) . Despite its flaws, which include the absence of an unselected control population, the absence of a specific pathogen free vivarium, and the relatively short life spans of all the tested groups, this study lends prima facie support for the hypothesis that inter-animal differences in immunological responsiveness may contribute to tumor susceptibility. It is in this context interesting to note that the high immune population was apparently more resistant both to hematologic as well as solid tumors.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 390, "end": 405, "text": "(Ershler, 1993;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 406, "end": 419, "text": "Miller, 1991c", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 420, "end": 434, "text": "Miller, , 1993", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 553, "end": 577, "text": "(Lilly and Pincus, 1973;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 578, "end": 602, "text": "Steeves and Lilly, 1977)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1218, "end": 1233, "text": "(Bubbers, 1984)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1444, "end": 1468, "text": "(Lilly and Pincus, 1973)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1622, "end": 1646, "text": "(Lilly and Pincus, 1973)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1944, "end": 1966, "text": "(Johnson et al., 1980)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2224, "end": 2245, "text": "(Covelli et al., 1985", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2246, "end": 2269, "text": "(Covelli et al., , 1989", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2904, "end": 2926, "text": "(Covelli et al., 1989)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Live Dead"}, {"text": "Our new data provide additional evidence that constitutionally weak immunity may predispose to the early development of certain forms of lymphoma.

We propose that this factor may be inter-individual differences in the rate of biological aging, which could lead both to early immunosenescence and, somewhat later in life, to premature development of disease. This idea can best be tested by using independent biomarkers of aging. Mice can be tested, early in life, for other physiological traits (e.g., muscle strength, collagen cross-linking, accumulation of oxidized lipids) that provide independent indices of aging rate but are much less likely to play a direct role in oncogenesis. Correlations between these measures and early-life tumor incidence will support the hypothesis that the relation between immunity and neoplasia we have noted actually represents linkage of both to aging. The idea that premature loss of immune subsets is linked to accelerated aging would also be supported by data showing that mice with poor early life immunity tend to exhibit higher mortality risks from forms of illness that, unlike neoplasia, are less plausibly attributed to immunosenescence per se. Further analysis of our current pilot experiment, and analysis of larger numbers of mice will be needed before we can determine whether any of our early life immunological tests predict late life tumor incidence, incidence of other forms of malignancy (e.g., solid tumors) and nonmalignant illness, and life expectancy among mice that do not die of lymphoma.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Live Dead"}, {"text": "This study represents the first use of a four-way crossbreeding scheme (Committee on Animal Models for Research on Aging, 1981) to examine hypotheses relating to links among the physiological changes seen in aging rodents and pathological processes.

We also note that the micromethods used for assessment of immune status make use of very small samples of tail blood (=s 400 (xl/sample), and thus do not require sacrifice of the test subject. Most previous work on immune function in aging rodents has used spleen or lymph node tissue in order to obtain sufficient numbers of lymphocytes for analysis; this approach is obviously unsuitable for designs that require determination of subsequent longevity and pathological outcome.
