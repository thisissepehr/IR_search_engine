From the viewpoint of both rationalist and constructivist theories of international organisation (IO) agency, an IO engaging in 'mission shrink' is a striking irregularity. In order to account for such apparently self-defeating behaviour, this article adopts an open systems view of IOs and identifies trans-organisational coalitions as important agents of IO change. I argue that subunit dynamics rather than systemic conditions drive IO behaviour, in particular where member states' material power and their formal control of organisational veto positions do not coincide. This approach will be used to retrace the changes in subunit coalitions that drove WHO's erratic HIV/AIDS programme and thus to solve this puzzle of 'mission shrink'.

Its Global Programme on AIDS (GPA), created in 1987, defied all suspicions about inertia in United Nations (UN) bureaucracies. GPA prided itself on its innovative and multidisciplinary approach in the fight against HIV/ AIDS, which became the standard for the public health community. It won unmatched donor support as well as collaboration by civil society and development organisations, and WHO was officially recognised as the leading agency in the UN response to HIV/AIDS (Jo\u00a8nsson 1996) . Yet in 1990, at the height of its activities, GPA started to contract and massively downsized its activities. Donor and member state support had not waned, GPA's mandate remained unchanged, and AIDS was far from being under control. In the absence of external constraints on further expansion, what moved WHO to give up momentum for leadership in international HIV/AIDS politics? Given that IOs are renowned for maintaining even dysfunctional programmes, why would WHO step back from one of its most successful programmes that powerfully underlined its constitutional leadership in international health governance? This puzzling move critically damaged WHO's position in the global HIV/AIDS field, and indeed within GPA's successor organisation, UNAIDS.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 91, "end": 104, "text": "(WHO 2006: 2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 719, "end": 734, "text": "(Jo\u00a8nsson 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Existing approaches to IO behaviour have difficulty in accounting for 'mission shrink' in international organisations (IOs).

Principal-agent (PA) theory's opportunistic and self-serving agents are challenged by constructivism's rule-driven bureaucracies, but in both versions bureaucratic agents strive to broaden their mandate and impose their policies as far as possible within given constraints.

Enthusiastic beginnings, a sudden withdrawal, and ultimately vain and unrealistic claims to leadership in UNAIDS point to internal contradictions and conflicts.

Drawing mainly on sociological organisation theory (Friedberg 1997; Pfeffer and Salancik 2003) , I focus on trans-organisational coalitions as the basic units of analysis. Transcending organisational boundaries, these coalitions sustain IO-environment transactions at the subunit level and pursue goals that may well be in conflict or incompatible with each other. They constitute 'local orders' (Friedberg 1997) beneath the corporate level, meaning that they are not mere reflections of the whole, but to some degree independent centres of organisational agency. 1 Such local factors, I will argue, become consequential where member states' 'external', material power diverges from their control of formal power positions inside IOs.

It consequently provoked not only a crisis of confidence, but also a decline in donations to GPA beginning in 1991 (Knight 2008: 18) . Thus, 1990 was a major turning point for WHO's role in HIV/AIDS politics. 3 The organisation interrupted the expansion of its flagship programme and reinterpreted its role from a global policy leader to a technical, medical agency. When UNAIDS was created in 1995, WHO belatedly attempted to reclaim UN-wide leadership (Knight 2008: 28) . However, it only became one of six co-sponsoring agencies which had a seat, but no vote, at UNAIDS' Programme Coordinating Board. 4 GPA was dismantled and its staff partially transferred to UNAIDS, so that in the late 1990s the number of full-time HIV/AIDS professionals at WHO went down to three (Gerbase et al. 2009: 8) . Following this transfer, it took the organisation nearly a decade to rebuild capacity in this priority field of international health work. 5 Established approaches to IO change have difficulty in accounting for this turnaround. Both rationalists and constructivists assume that IOs have a tendency for 'mission creep' rather than self-restraint. First, the rationalist PA approach suggests that self-serving IO 'agents' continuously strive to expand their budget and mandate, exploiting their principals' uncertainty as to whether budget increases are necessary and efficient or not (Niskanen 1994) . This form of agency slack is, from a PA perspective, one of the greatest risks states face when delegating authority to IOs (Copelovitch 2010: 54, 57) and part of the explanation why IOs 'never die' (Strange 1998) . To contain the expansionary tendencies of their agents, states can deploy budgetary constraints or circumscribe the IO's mandates (Nielson and Tierney 2003: 242; Hawkins et al. 2006: 30) . However, such limitations were not present in the GPA case when the programme started to contract in 1990. Donors and member state principals did not change GPA's mandate (Soni 1998: 93) , resource supply was abundant, and AIDS continued to spread while knowledge about the disease continued to grow (Mann et al. 1992) .

In fact, both approaches start from the assumption that there is some corporate interest that the organisation seeks to preserve collectively.

Such a view suggests that decision making in IOs is either determined by a 'dominant' organisational culture (e.g., Weaver 2008: 73), or the outcome of an internal dispute where the parties ultimately settle on the position that is in the organisation's best interest (Barnett and Coleman 2005: 601) .

First, by reifying the PA divide, scholars neglect the more subtle dynamics through which agents and principals mutually influence each other.

The states, private actors, and civil society organisations that make up an IO's environment place complex and often contradictory demands on IOs.

From that perspective, the preference constellation among major principals is indeed the most important and systematic predictor for IO behaviour (Copelovitch 2010) .

Yet, in other IOs -most prominently the UN organisations that have adopted the 'one state, one vote' principle -organisational and external power relationships diverge. As a result, some member states (or member state subgroups) may be in a position to block organisational decisions even though the materially most powerful states would favour such decisions. Translated into IO subunits, this means that subunits allied with externally powerful member states (or private donors) may have better access to material power, while subunits allied with member states occupying critical veto points may dispose of superior formal power.

Such an approach also resonates with recent attempts by historical institutionalists to categorise modes of institutional change in terms of actor and rule characteristics (Mahoney and Thelen 2010, especially 18-22) and thus takes up the challenge of bringing research on IO change and research on the state closer together (Barnett 2002) . 15 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 727, "end": 741, "text": "(Barnett 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Implications: IO change and types of trans-organisational coalitions"}, {"text": "Fragmentation and competition for funding in the domain of global health governance are increasingly blamed for undermining collective action and sustainable policy making (e.g., Cohen 2006; Kickbusch et al. 2010; Lee 2010) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 179, "end": 190, "text": "Cohen 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 191, "end": 213, "text": "Kickbusch et al. 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 214, "end": 223, "text": "Lee 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "As this article has shown, fragmentation not only undermines coordination between organisations, but also coherent action by individual organisations. Starting from the puzzle that the GPA's 'mission shrink' poses for established explanations of IO change, I have proposed an alternative conceptualisation of IOs -not as actors, but as 'open systems' that transact with their environments through multiple and decentralised organisational channels. This turn to agency at rather than within IO boundaries brings to the fore the transorganisational coalitions that are forged between organisational units and supporters in the IO environment. These coalitions establish their own local orders and may control different sources of power, both formal and material. Thus, I have argued that local coalitions are most likely to make a difference for IO change where states' formal and material power resources do not coincide, which makes them dependent on alliances with power holders within the organisation. The GPA case illustrates these claims as it was a major coalitional shift that caused the programme's surprising contraction. Beyond solving the GPA puzzle, I have used this and further observations from WHO to systematise the local orders approach to IO change and distinguished trans-organisational coalitions according to the veto power and material resources controlled by them. I have argued that these types of coalitions tend to be linked with different types of IO agency and change. Obviously, this rough typology needs to be specified and refined in future research. Organisational interest constellations and decision rules vary across contexts, and thus can spur quite different dynamics of organisational change. Thus, the categories offered in this heuristic can serve as a starting point, but certainly not the endpoint of research into trans-organisational coalitions. In particular, the question of reform and endogenous change has to be addressed in future research. Material power and organisational veto may be empirically distinguishable, but can still be causally interrelated, as when powerful states manage to reform IO decision rules in their favour. The reform history of IOs such as the UN suggests that this is not a typical development and that formal privileges can easily be protected against powerful challengers (Hosli et al. 2011 ). Yet, the question remains whether formal control and material resources interact to reinforce or undermine each other. Research along these lines can enhance our understanding of the drivers of IO change beyond the PA dichotomy, the analytical fruitfulness of which has come under increasing attack in recent years.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2351, "end": 2369, "text": "(Hosli et al. 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "Finally, disaggregating IOs into trans-organisational coalitions also opens avenues for applying new methodological tools to IO research. In particular, inter-organisation relationships and coalitional dynamics can be grasped with quantitative network analysis techniques, which have recently gained prominence in International Relations (IR) research (Hafner-Burton et al. 2009 ). In IR scholarship, network analysis is mostly applied to investigate ties between nations (Maoz 2011) . However, it could equally be used to map transorganisational ties and explore the nodes and positions resulting from transorganisational networks. This would allow researchers to assess whether formal, hierarchical 'centrality' is reflected in various types of empirical centrality in organisations (cf. Hafner-Burton et al. 2009: 563-5) . Such research would require detailed empirical data on the ties between organisational actors, but may well pay off with astonishing insights into the actual transactions and relationships in and across IOs. 5 WHO only re-established a full-fledged HIV/AIDS department in 2001 (Gerbase et al. 2009: 10) . 6 See also Broome and Seabrooke (2012) for an investigation of how IO units 'read' the relevant organisational environment. 7 This focus on trans-organisational coalitions slightly differs from open systems approaches that are primarily concerned with 'boundary spanners', that is, actors specialised in managing interorganisational relations (Ansell and Weber 1999: 92; Jo\u00a8nsson 1986: 41) . For example, the 'proximate principals' that Elsig (2011) has identified as relevant players in the World Trade Organization could be considered as such boundary role occupants. By contrast, the coalitional view emphasises that actors need not be specialised in 'external relations' to be part of transorganisational coalitions, and seeks to integrate the roles played by organisational actors and their external allies. 8 In fact, however, the director-general's selection is made by the Executive Board, which is currently composed of 34 individuals and usually meets twice a year. The Board prepares WHA decisions, monitors the work of the secretariat and nominates the director-general, who is formally appointed by the Assembly. 9 WHO is regionally subdivided into a Southeast Asian, a Western Pacific, an African, an Eastern Mediterranean, an American and a European region. 10 Besides the recognition that HIV/AIDS was a multisectoral challenge, which had also guided the work of GPA, a chief motive for switching to UNAIDS was 'donor fatigue' (Chin 2007: 204) . UNAIDS was not charged with direct assistance, but with coordination, thus reducing the overall cost of the international HIV/AIDS response (Soni 1998: 65-9) . 11 Although Nakajima's 1993 re-election was certainly the most scandalised ballot in WHO's history, allegations of intransparency and suspicions of horse trading regularly accompany director-general elections in WHO (Horton 2006) . 12 WHO's governing bodies had decided in 1996 that henceforth director-generals could only serve for two terms, a rule unprecedented among UN organisations. Nakajima as the current incumbent was exempted from this new rule, but the decision de-legitimated a bid for another term (Godlee 1996) . 13 In 2006, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was the third (equal with Japan) largest contributor of funding to the WHO, providing voluntary contributions of US $99.4 million (People's Health Movement, Medact and Global Equity Gauge Alliance 2008: 227). 14 In 2006, because of the scarcity of core funds, WHO was permitted to allocate extrabudgetary donations to core running costs (Lee 2009: 106) , yet the source of the problem remained unaddressed.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 352, "end": 378, "text": "(Hafner-Burton et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 472, "end": 483, "text": "(Maoz 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 790, "end": 823, "text": "Hafner-Burton et al. 2009: 563-5)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1103, "end": 1128, "text": "(Gerbase et al. 2009: 10)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1142, "end": 1169, "text": "Broome and Seabrooke (2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1474, "end": 1501, "text": "(Ansell and Weber 1999: 92;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1502, "end": 1520, "text": "Jo\u00a8nsson 1986: 41)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1568, "end": 1580, "text": "Elsig (2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2574, "end": 2590, "text": "(Chin 2007: 204)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2733, "end": 2750, "text": "(Soni 1998: 65-9)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2969, "end": 2982, "text": "(Horton 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 3264, "end": 3277, "text": "(Godlee 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 3667, "end": 3682, "text": "(Lee 2009: 106)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Essence of Decision: Explaining the Cuban Missile Crisis", "authors": [{"first": "Graham", "middle": ["T"], "last": "Allison", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1971, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Leadership Change in the World Health Organization: Potential for Increased Effectiveness?", "authors": [{"first": "Steinar", "middle": [], "last": "Andresen", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2002, "venue": "Fridtjof Nansens Institutt.
