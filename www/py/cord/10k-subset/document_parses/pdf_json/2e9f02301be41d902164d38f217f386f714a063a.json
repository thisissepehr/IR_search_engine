A few patients fail to respond (primary non-responders) while there are others who form antibodies and loose response with time (secondary non-responders). The complex multifactorial relationship between covariates and IFX distribution limits a direct correlation between dose and drug level. Recently, Bayesian systems in dashboard formats have been proposed for use in clinical practice. We aimed to assess the accuracy and efficacy of the iDose dashboard system. Methods The IFX levels estimated in our laboratory in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients as a part of clinical service (n=20) were compared with that forecasted by the iDose dashboard software. Patient's clinical history, demographic details, laboratory findings such as albumin and CRP were entered in the software and the predicted IFX level was compared with the estimated level. In addition, dashboard guided dosing strategy was prescribed in 3 patients and the clinical outcome was followed. Results Of the 20 patients, concordance in estimated and predicted IFX level was seen in 16 patients. iDose guided dosing was clinically useful to achieve target therapeutic response in all three patients. The dosing interval was increased from 4 weeks to 7 weeks in two patients and, in the third patient, the dosing was optimized with multiple drug estimations and iDose prediction. Conclusion The iDose dashboard forecast for IFX level and dosing regimen was in concurrence with the estimated IFX level. This approach optimized the infliximab therapy by individualized IFX dosing and duration.

Steroids are used in treatment of severe alcoholic hepatitis (MDF >32: MELD>20) and may exacerbate sepsis so it is vital to differentiate infection vs. inflammation. Fc receptor (Fc\u03b3R1 or CD64) expression on neutrophils and soluble TREM-1 (Triggering Receptor Expressed on Monocytes) are potential biomarkers of bacterial infections. Aim To Assess the clinical usefulness of quantitative CD64 measurement on neutrophils measurements in differentiating bacterial infection from onflammation in patients of SAH. Methods Patients with bacterial infection (n=58), active disease (n=70), and healthy controls (n=20) were included. Neutrophil CD64 expression using flow cytometry and procalcitonin C-reactive protein levels were studied.",

            "text": "Introduction End-stage liver diseases (ESLD) represent a major, neglected global public health crisis which requires urgent actions towards finding proper cure. Orthotopic liver transplantation has been only definitive treatment modality for ESLD. However, shortage of donor organs, timely unavailability, post-surgery related complications and financial burden to the patients limits the number of patients receiving transplants. Hence alternative choices are highly desirable to overcome the limitations of current modalities. In present study we have explored a new concept of generating secondary humanized livers through intraomental transplantation in rats which can be used for the management of ESLD. Methods Decellularization of whole rat liver was performed using gradients of detergents within 20 h through hepatic artery perfusion at defined flow rate. Decellularized liver scaffolds (DLS) were characterized extensively for preservation of ECM, vasculature and organ architecture. The humanization of DLS was performed post-sterilization using human hepatic progenitor cells (hHPCs) under controlled ex vivo condition. The structural and functional response of engineered humanized livers was identified to explore its use in drug evaluation and further transplanted in rat omentum. The structural and functional characteristics of transplanted grafts were identified after day 3 and day 30. Results An efficient decellularization protocol was developed to generate completely DLS within 20h of continuous perfusion through hepatic artery while retaining intact ECM proteins, liver vasculature and architecture. The engraftment efficiency of cells within the DLS was found to be >98%. Functional analysis of repopulated liver cells was identified by quantification of albumin and urea. Retrieved humanized liver grafts didn't show visible fibrotic reactions at the site of transplantation. Grafts were found to be well embedded in the peritoneal cavity with neovascularisation without immunological rejection. Conclusion The present study demonstrates generation of secondary humanized livers with neo-vascularization during intra-omental transplantation of bioengineered livers in rats.",

            "text": "Introduction The ideal analgesic is not known for patients with acute pancreatitis (AP). Concerns have been raised about serious adverse effects of opioid analgesics increasing the severity of AP. We hypothesized that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) might be better analgesics due to their anti-inflammatory effect. Our objective was to compare pentazocine, an opioid, and diclofenac, an NSAID for adequate analgesia in patients with AP. Methods In a double-blind randomized controlled trial, patients with AP were randomized to either intravenous Diclofenac 75 mg or Pentazocine 30 mg. Fentanyl was given as a rescue analgesic through a patientcontrolled analgesia pump. Primary outcome was pain relief measured objectively by the dose of fentanyl required as rescue analgesic, pain-free period, and numbers of good and bad demands of fentanyl. Secondary outcome was adverse events. Results Fifty patients were randomized: 24 to pentazocine group and 26 to diclofenac group. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups. Pentazocine was found to be better than diclofenac in terms of significantly lower dose of rescue analgesic (fentanyl) required [126 \u03bcg (range 0-960 \u03bcg) vs. 225.5 \u03bcg (range 0-810 \u03bcg); p=0.028], and longer pain-free period (31.1\u00b18.2 hours vs. 27.9\u00b16.6 hours, p=0.047). The number of good and bad demands was lower in the pentazocine compared with diclofenac group (11.5 [range 0-92] vs. 16 [range 0-85], p=0.098) although not statistically significant. Adverse events were similar between the groups. Conclusion Pentazocine, a kappa opioid receptor agonist, was significantly better than diclofenac for pain relief in AP.

            "text": "Background Vertical transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) from infected mother to the new-born often results in viral persistence. To understand mechanisms of materno-fetal HBV-transmission and viral persistence, we studied maternal immunity and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) transcriptome in mothers and new-borns. Methods Fifty HBsAg positive mothers and babies were included; 22 with the transmission (Gr. I, T, n=22) and 28 with no transmission (Gr. II, NT, n=28) to the new-borns, and compared with healthy mother-baby pairs (Gr. III, n=10). PBMCs were analyzed for HBV-specific DCs, T cells, T follicular helper (TFh), B cells and functional immune responses, cytokine levels as well as transcriptome signatures to identify immune gene expression correlates for protective immunity. Results Group II mothers had lower HBsAg levels (3.82 x103 vs. 1.493x104, p<0 .0001) with greater HBV specific responses of DCs, T cells, TFh and B cell than Gr. I mothers. The percentage frequencies of TFh cells had lower (11.06\u00b11.71 vs. 18.05\u00b11. 74, p=0.02) in Gr. I mothers was accompanied with reduced IL21 (356.1\u00b150.17 vs. 493.6\u00b156.70, p=0 .04) levels. TFh frequencies and IL21 levels inversely correlated with HBV DNA levels. The cut-off level of 9.5% and 8.93% from the receiver operating curve predicted the involvement of TFh and B cells in HBV transmission. Transcriptome signatures revealed that maternal gene imprints were reflected in their new-borns. Further genes related to DCs, TFH and B cells and were increased in Gr. II. HBsAg+ve new-borns showed a boost in cellular and humoral responses after vaccination. Conclusion In HBV infected mothers, low serum IL-21 levels, decreased TFh and plasma B cell frequencies are associated with vertical transmission of HBV to new-born. These features are indicative of low protective immunity.",

The present study compared the gut microbiome of patients with UC, ASC and healthy controls (HC). Methods Patients with mild to moderate UC (n=23), ASC (n=21) and healthy controls (n=24) were recruited prospectively. A metagenomics approach was used to explore gut microbial diversity and genetic repertoires. Ulcerative colitis was diagnosed using ECCO guidelines and ASC was diagnosed using Truelove and Witts' criteria. Results Genus level diversity (Simpson diversity measure) was significantly lower in ASC than in mild-moderately active UC (p<0.05), or HC (p<0.001). The gut microbiome in ASC was highly unstable, as characterized by high intra-cohort variation (analyzed using Jdivergence measure) which was significantly greater than in UC or HC. On principal coordinate analysis, the microbiome of HC and UC were similar, with the ASC cohort being distinct from both. On quantitative evaluation of these differences (random forest classifiers), both ASC vs. HC and UC comparisons revealed excellent classification accuracy, with >90% patients being correctly classified. Statistical comparison of the ranked abundances identified four distinct clusters of genera (G1A, G1B, G2A, G2B), with specific trends in their abundance patterns across the three groups: the G1A/G1B clusters had the least, whereas G2A/G2B had the highest abundance in the ASC cohort. Interestingly, several known health-associated bacteria (Faecalibacterium, Prevotella and Roseburia) exhibited different oligotypes, with distinct oligotypes segregating into health and disease states (ASC).",

            "text": "Introduction Endoscopic management of post-cholecystectomy benign biliary stricture with multiple plastic stents is routinely practised in many centers. However, data from India is scarce. Our aim was to assess efficacy and outcome of endoscopic management of these patients. Methods A retrospective study was done in a referral center from January 2004 till May 2018. Seventy-three patients were included in the study. During each ERCP, increasing number of stents were place, stent exchange was done every 3 monthly for a period of 12 months and all the stents were removed at the end of therapy. Subsequently, patient was followed up with ultrasonography of abdomen and liver function tests every three monthly, ERCP was repeated if symptomatic or abnormal liver function parameter. Results Of 73 patients, technical success of endoscopic biliary cannulation achieved in 70 (96%). Three patients with failed biliary cannulation underwent hepaticojejunostomy. Due to inadequate biliary drainage and unwilling for repeated endotherapy, six patients, underwent hepaticojejunostomy. Seven patients were lost to follow up after initiation of endotherapy. Two patients died, one due to myocardial infarction and another due to underlying chronic kidney disease. Four patients found to have malignant stricture, underwent palliative biliary stenting. Fifty-one patients completed therapy. Median age of patients was 39 years (range 23-86), mostly females (72%). Median number of procedures, maxium number of stents per session, duration of therapy were 4.2 (2-7), 4 (2-8), 13 months (6-26) respectively. The mean and median duration of follow up after completion of therapy was 41 and 33 months respectively (3-137). One patient had stricture recurrence, underwent hepaticojejunostomy. Conclusions Endoscopic therapy is feasible in post cholecystectomy BBS with technical success of 96%. Recurrence of stricture is rare and at a median follow up of 3 years, bile duct patency is maintained in 98%.",

            "text": "A proteomic approach to identify dysregulated lipid transporter proteins which could predict the severity and outcome of patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure Incretins are hormones secreted into the gastrointestinal tract upon food ingestion. They promote insulin secretion by acting on pancreatic b cells in a blood-glucose-dependent manner. Two incretins, glucosedependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucose dependent glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1, have been identified. GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) can reduce blood glucose levels and have been reported to have several extrapancreatic effects. All enteroendocrine cells (EECs) sense nutrients present in intestinal lumen. Whereas the molecular mechanisms by which specific nutrients are detected, and their impact on the secretion of different peptides, is still poorly understood. EECs express various types of receptors including for sweet, bitter and other taste. These properties are also true for K and L cells; K cells are predominantly found in duodenum whereas L cells are located in ileum and colon. However, a recently described population of K/L cells secretes both GIP and GLP-1. Their effects have been best demonstrated when glucose is orally ingested, compared to when the same amount of glucose is administered intravenously and GLP-1 being more potent than GIP.",

Inflammation causes cellular changes undistinguishable from neoplasia solely based on cytological evaluation, because tissue architecture and cell morphology are essential for accurate pathological assessment. Various EUS-guided techniques are available with variable success and complication rates. Methods Single centre, prospective, randomized study. All patients above 18 years of age, having intestinal and extraintestinal solid mass lesions, were randomized to EUS-FNA and tissue diagnostic yield were compared based on the histopathological analysis of samples produced by the 19GP, 19GS and 22GP needles. Patients with INR >1.5, platelets <50000 were excluded. Results Total 215 patients were evaluated and EUS-FNA was technically feasible in 210 (97.67%) cases. Three needle passes were made in every case. There was no significant difference between these three groups with regard to the age (p-0.676), gender (p-0.856), location (p-0.998), echogenicity (p-0.123), size (p-0.735 and 0.374) of the lesions and presence of calcification (p-0.093) or necrosis (p-0.729). Sample suitable for pathological evaluation were obtained in 90.5% cases with a tissue core in 45.7% cases. 28.1% lesions were malignant, 62.4% were benign and 9.5% remained undiagnosed. The histopathological diagnoses were possible in 87.1%, 90.0% and 94.3% cases respectively with 22GP, . Presence of blood clot in order of 19GP (70.00%) >22GP (50.00%) >19GS (42. 8%), (p-value 0.003). There were no post procedure complications noted in any group. Conclusion EUS-guided biopsy with these three needles was feasible and safe. The diagnostic yield of these three needles for providing adequate sample for histopathological analysis was clinically significant but not Statistical significant. Procore needles did not offer the extra possibility of obtaining a core sample for histopathological analysis in this study but there is high possibility of presence of blood clots.",

Aims To estimate the predictive accuracy of Day1 SIRS in determining MOF in patients with severe AH. To estimate the predictive accuracy of Day1 SIRS in determining the 30 day mortality in patients with severe AH. Methods Day 1 SIRS score in all consecutive patients with severe AH (DF \u226532) admitted in the wards of Medical Gastroenterology over a period of 1 year from the date of ethical committee clearance was taken and its relation with complications and mortality was studied and followed up for 1 m to look for morbidity and mortality. Results A total of 133 patients with severe AH were taken out of which 94 had D1 SIRS 50 patients had 30 d mortality, 47 patients developed renal failure, 54 patients had MOF. Out of 47 patients who had RF 43 had D1 SIRS (91%). Out of 54 patients with MOF 50 (100%) had D1 SIRS. Out of 50 patients with 30d mortality, 50 (100%) had D1 SIRS. Higher D1 scores of SIRS were found to have higher sensitivity and specificity in predicting both the development of RF, MOF and 30d mortality. Conclusions D1 SIRS can be used to predict the development of renal failure and MOF in patients with severe AH with very high sensitivity. Therefore, D1 SIRS can be used as a screening tool to stratify patients with severe AH and facilitate early referral, ICU admissions, thereby reducing adverse outcomes Introduction Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation may be responsible for steroid refractory acute severe colitis (ASC), which requires rescue therapy in form of surgery or advanced immunosuppression. The optimum technique for diagnosing CMV colitis in this setting remains unclear. We investigated the role of CMV quantitative PCR for diagnosing CMV colitis and for predicting of steroid-failure in ASC. Methods Consecutive patients with ASC satisfying Truelove and Witts' criteria, hospitalized at a single centre from May 2016 to November 2017, were included. The primary outcome measure was steroid-failure defined as colectomy and/or rescue therapy with ciclosporin or infliximab during admission. Oxford criteria, ulcerative colitis index of severity (UCEIS) at day 1 and fecal calprotectin (FCP) at day 3 were used to predict steroid response. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative PCR for CMV Sarcina ventriculi, a gram-positive coccus, is occasionally found in gastric biopsies. Although Sarcina had been described more than 150 years ago, little is known about its pathogenicity in humans. We, report clinicopathologic characteristics of 11 patients with Sarcina in gastric or duodenal biopsies. All eleven patients had presence of Sarcina ventriculi on the luminal mucosal surface of epithelium with mucosal injury. Of these eleven patients, ten patients had gastric outlet obstruction (GOO). Of these ten patients with GOO, 5 had antral narrowing and 5 had duodenal obstruction. Three patients had malignant GOO (2-carcinoma stomach, 1-carcinoma duodenum), 5 had ulcers with edematous narrowing (1-H pylori, 1-eosinophilic gastritis) and 2 had duodenal stricture. All patients had etiology other than sarcina for GOO. Of the 3 patients that had follow up endoscopy on resolution of symptoms, all patients had gastric residue on endoscopy. One patient had recurrence of symptoms with persistence of sarcina on biopsy at 3 months. Symptoms improved at 6 months and no evidence of sarcina on biopsy at 6 months. Thus, our findings suggest gastric outlet obstruction can be considered as a predisposing factor for Sarcina infection. Sarcina infection may not be the etiology for GOO but may complicate recovery and may lead to life-threatening complications. Therefore, the clinician and pathologist must be aware of such microorganisms. Moreover, if pathologist identified it in biopsies, it must be documented in the final report as the findings may have therapeutic consideration and warrant further investigation.",

Single nucleotide polymorphisms are an important category of DNA mutations play role in disease etiology. The present study is aimed to evaluate the role of a novel polymorphism 19 GC polymorphism in exon-1 of Heme oxygenase (HMOX-1) gene in the etiology of GC. Methods Genomic DNA was extracted from a total of 100 endoscopically and histopathologically confirmed GC cases and 100 healthy controls for the present retrospective case-control study. Genotyping of 19 GC polymorphism was carried out by amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) method. Statistical analyses were performed by SNPstats online software program for the evaluation of results. Results Risk factor profile of the GC patients showed that advanced age i.e. \u226550 years, male gender, consumption of non-vegetarian diet, addiction to smoking or alcohol, consanguinity, and H. pylori infection were the significant epidemiological risk factors (p<0.05). The statistical analyses revealed 3.35 fold risk of GC for subjects with C/C genotype and 2.11 fold risk for those carrying C allele indicating possible implication of C/C genotype and C allele in disease phenotype. In cross-classification analysis the C/C genotype in association with male gender, alcoholism, smoking, H. pylori infection and parental consanguinity disclosed 5. 23, 9.15, 12.8, 3.8 and 3.9 folds enhanced risk of GC, respectively. Conclusion The present study is first of its kind in the world to investigate the role of HMOX1 exon1 polymorphism in the etiology of GC. The C allele and C/C genotype of the 19 GC polymorphism of HMOX 1 gene is significantly associated with enhanced risk of GC, suggesting it as a candidate genetic/molecular marker. Hence, the current study highlights the role of HMOX1 exon1 polymorphism as a potential prognostic marker for GC.",

Methods Prospectively collected database of ALF/ACLF patients who had PLEX (October 2017-June 2018) was retrospectively analyzed. Serial plasma vWF antigen levels (normal: 50-150 u/dL) and MELD scores were analyzed in patients with \u22651 month follow up after discharge from hospital. vWF levels in PLEX filtrate were analyzed. Results Five ALF and 4 ACLF patients, 32 (16-59) years, median (range) old, 7 males, had follow up \u22654 weeks after PLEX. Duration of hospital stay was 20 (7-35) days and later follow up was 70 days.

Markedly raised plasma vWF levels reduced from 705 (300-1048) u/dL at admission to 418 (151-681) u/dL at discharge (after PLEX) and 262 (96-710) u/dL at last follow up. PLEX treatment reduced plasma vWF levels (median estimated daily decrease in plasma vWF level was 13% during PLEX treatment compared to 1% after discharge from hospital, no further PLEX given). In PLEX filtrate tested in 7 patients, vWF levels were 249.7 (24 -496.5) u/dL. Conclusion Reduction in MELD scores and in plasma vWF levels were seen in ALF and ACLF patients with PLEX. Plasma vWF reduction was higher while patients were on PLEX compared to later follow up. vWF was demonstrated in PLEX filtrate.

Mitochondrial dysfunction was monitored by transmission electron microscopy, polarization status, biogenesis, ROS level and respiration rate. Explants/biopsies from normal, fibrosis (stage 1-2), compensated cirrhosis (stage 5-6) and decompensated cirrhosis (stage 5-6) without any known etiology were examined for presence of senescent cells (n=15/ group). Changes in expression of UPRMT genes were evaluated in vitro and in tissue samples. CLPP was cloned, overexpressed and its effect on mitochondrial functions and senescence were examined. Results Premature senescence was confirmed by SA-\u03b2-galactosidase staining, loss of Lamin B1 and Ki67 with increase in p21, p53 and \u03b3H2AX in both in vitro and cirrhotic liver. Senescent cells accumulated during progression from compensated (no varices/ascites) to decompensated (varices+ascites) state. Senescent hepatocytes in culture and in cirrhotic liver showed defective mitochondria with loss of cristae and mtDNA. Senescent hepatocytes showed decline in protein levels of key UPRMT players viz., Hsp60, Hsp10 and CLPP. Compensated cirrhotic liver exhibited strong UPRMT response, which was downregulated >2 fold in decompensated state. Of all the UPRMT genes, CLPP showed maximal increase (15 fold) in compensated cirrhosis (p<0.05), and when overexpressed it mitigated doxorubicin induced senescent phenotype by inhibiting mitochondrial ROS and altering oxygen consumption rate. Conclusion Our results show a compromised UPRMT during hepatocyte senescence in decompensated cirrhosis. Restoring CLPP levels appears to be a promising strategy for preventing hepatocyte senescence and possibly end-stage liver disease.",

However, Imaging techniques are suboptimal in detecting early CP. Proportion of patients of idiopathic recurrent acute pancreatitis (IRAP) are known to progress to CP. Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging (ARFI) technique by measuring velocity of shear waves through the target organ/ROI quantifies the degree of fibrosis. The aim of this study was to use ARFI to assess pancreatic fibrosis and hence diagnose early chronic pancreatitis, in patients with IRAP and compare it with a group of controls. Methods A prospective study was done between June 2016 -March 2018. Patients with IRAP who did not fulfil EUS criteria for chronic pancreatitis were included. Controls included patients with no history of pancreatic disorder in whom EUS was done for an alternate indication. History, physical examination and relevant laboratory investigations were recorded. Elastography using ARFI was done by single radiologist who was blinded to cases and controls. Results A total of 31 patients and 31 controls were included. Mean age of patients in IRAP was 24.8 (SD) years, disease duration was 3.45 (SD) years, mean number of episodes 4.9 (SD). Using ARFI there was a significant difference in the shear wave velocity between patients (1.27\u00b10.50 m/s) and controls (1.00\u00b10.17 m/s) (p-0.001). ARFI scores also showed statistically significant positive correlation with number of pain episodes and negatively correlation with BMI. Conclusion The present study shows that despite EUS not showing evidence of chronic pancreatitis, patients with IRAP have evidence of fibrosis of the pancreas. Further long-term follow up studies are necessary to assess the outcome of these patients with fibrosis.",

Identification of HCV infected subjects at early stages, represents an urgent need due to continuous increasing prevalence and mortality and further to improve long-term prognosis of these individuals. Hence, the present study was undertaken to identify the role of miRNAs panel containing miR-21, miR-122 and miR-181a to identify their viral kinetics during HCV infection and treatment response in patients infected with HCV genotype 1 and genotype 3. Methods A total of 25 healthy controls and 184 HCV patients (treatment with PEG-IFN\u03b12a, RBV, sofosbuvir, daclatasvir and ledipasvir) were enrolled in the present study. Viral RNA was extracted from serum followed by quantification of HCV viral load at different time points before and after treatment. Expression of selected miRNA's (miR-21, miR-122 and miR-181a) were assessed by RT-qPCR and correlated with viral load and liver function test (LFT). Results The expression level of miRNA-21 was significantly high in HCC patients compare to control subjects. The miRNA-21 expression level was significant decrease with increasing the treatment duration and was almost negligible at the end of treatment for chronic HCV. miRNA-122 showed significantly high expression level of (>2.0-fold, p<0.001) in chronic patients as compared to the healthy subjects. After treatment with all the regimens the expression level of miRNA-122 was gradually decreased in HCV infected subjects. Whereas the expression levels of miRNA-181a got significantly enhanced with increasing the treatment duration (p<0.001). Conclusion The panel of miRNAs can be used to identify the HCV related disease conditions such as acute, chronic, cirrhosis and HCC. miRNA-181a could be a good disease progressive marker in combination with miRNA-122 and miRNA-21 further to segregate different category of HCV.",

In contrast to adults, there is a paucity of IBS therapeutic trials in pediatric age group. Methods This study was conducted at the Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology in a tertiary care center in North India from June 2016 to May 2017. Eighty-one subjects aged 4 to 18 years, diagnosed with IBS as per the ROME IV criteria were randomized and double blinded across two groups, receiving Psyllium and placebo (maltodextrin). They were further classified into three subgroups, D (diarrhea predominant), C (constipation predominant) or M (mixed pattern) IBS. Efficacy in each drug limb was analyzed after 4 weeks by comparing the IBS severity scoring scale (IBS SSS) before and after therapy. Remission was defined with IBS SSS <75. Categorical data was compared with Chi-square test and paired categorical variable was compared with Mc Nemer's test. Results Among the 81 subjects the mean age was 9.8 years. The baseline demography and IBS SSS was comparable in the psyllium group (n=43) and placebo group (n=38), IBS SSS being 275 and 260 respectively. Subtypes of IBS had a comparable distribution in the 2 groups. Fortyone in psyllium limb and 31 in placebo limb completed the trial. After 4 weeks of therapy, the median IQR IBS SSS was much lower in psyllium limb i.e. 75 (42.5-140) compared to placebo limb which was 225 (185-270) (p=<0.001). Forty-four percent in psyllium limb had remission compared with 9.7% in placebo (p<0.001). This improvement was irrespective of the subtype. Conclusion Psyllium husk is highly effective for the therapy of Pediatric IBS irrespective of the subtypes, when compared with placebo.",

Adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cell (ADMSC) are characterized by immunosuppressive and regenerative properties, hence considered for autologous transplantation in liver disease. Chronic liver disease (CLD) causes derangement of the bone marrow MSC and loss of hematopoietic stem cells contributing to immunological dysfunctions and reduced regenerative potential. It is possible that CLD induces oxidative stress and senescence in various cell types in human body-the same may be true for MSC from various compartments. The goal of the study is to compare the proliferative and differentiation potential of ADMSC of CLD compared to healthy individuals. Methods Adipose tissues from cirrhotic patients and their healthy donors undergoing living donor liver transplantation was collected. ADMSC were isolated, characterized and differentiated to osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes following the established protocol. Proliferative potential was assessed by serial passages. We performed H&E staining of adipose tissue, immunofluorescence/IHC for the relevant CD markers and \u03b2-galactosidase staining for senescence in ADMSC. Mitochondrial oxidative stress was assessed by live imaging of cells with a free radical sensor dye. Results Fifteen consenting donor and recipient ADMSC's were analyzed. Increased inflammatory infiltrate was noted in recipient adipose tissue compared to the healthy donor. ADMSC from both showed characteristic plastic adherence and there was no difference in CD markers. Donor ADMSC showed subjectively better differentiation capacity to osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondrocytes compared to the recipients. Recipient ADMSC proliferated faster initially in culture and then slows down and undergoes senescence faster compared to the donors and had higher mitochondrial ROS levels. Conclusion Adipose tissue is affected in CLD and ADMSC from CLD patients attain senescence faster. Further studies are required before concluding on the regenerative potential and the suitability of autologous ADMSC transplantation in CLD patients.",

We aim to determine the utility of RS for diagnosis of rectosigmoidal pathologies in the outpatient setting with emphasis on neoplastic lesions, and to determine yearly trends in various pathologies involving the rectum. Methods Retrospective study using the RS records and histopathology reports of five years (July 2013 to June 2018) done in the Department of Gastroenterology at Medical College, Calicut. Results During the study period 9418 RS examinations were done and a total of 6921 abnormalities were picked up, giving a diagnostic yield of 73.5%. Most common indication was bleeding per rectum (51%), followed by constipation (29%) and to assess endoscopic activity in inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis (IBD UC) (9%). The most common lesion found was hemorrhoids 39.8% followed by proctitis 13.7%, neoplasms 9.7%, polyps 6.7%, and solitary rectal ulcers 2.4% and others 1.2% while 26.5% studies were normal. Histopathology reports showed 7.7% were biopsy proven for malignancy, 5.8% were adenoma, 12.2% were IBD UC, 2.2% were SRUS, 2.7% were normal and 1.4% were inconclusive. Of the 4812 patients with complaints of bleeding per rectum 4739 (98.5%) had a diagnosis after RS, of which hemorrhoids (72.7%) was the most common cause followed by proctitis (14.2%), neoplasm (9%) and others (4.1%). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value of RS in detecting neoplasia is 98.2%, 96.8%, 66.1%, 99.9% respectively. RS was found to be effective for assessing activity in IBD UC. Five yearly trends in RS findings show a significant (p<0.05) increase in the incidence of IBD UC, neoplasia and hemorrhoids. Conclusion RS is a simple and effective tool for diagnosing various rectosigmoid pathologies. The incidence of IBD UC, neoplasia rectum and hemorrhoids is increasing. RS can be used as an effective screening test for rectosigmoid pathologies especially neoplasia and IBD UC. [081] 047 Prevalence of cerebral edema and other structural changes in acuteon-chronic liver failure (CMBs) in 6 (14.6%) and 2 (4.8%) patients had cerebral edema. In AD patients T2W diffuse WMHs seen in 3 (23%), T2W focal WMHs in 3 (23 %), T1W basal ganglia hyperintensities in 9 (69.2%). while no patients had cerebral edema or CMBs. In compensated cirrhosis T2W diffuse WMHs seen in 7 (33.3%), T2W focal WMHs in 5 (23.8 %), T1W basal ganglia hyperintensities in 15 (71.4%), 2 (11.8%) patients had CMBs. MR spectroscopy was done in total 32 patients, but changes were not significant among ACLF, AD and CLD patients. Thirty and 90 days survival for patients with diffuse T2W WMHs was significantly lesser than patients without T2W WMHs (p=0.007). Conclusion Cerebral edema is uncommon in ACLF patients.

Biofeedback therapy (BFT) is an established modality of treatment for patients having DD. Despite its documented success, it has been scarcely reported in Indian studies. We report our experience of BFT in patients with DD. Methods Consecutive patients who underwent BFT for DD in past 6 months in our gastrointestinal motility laboratory were included in study. All patients underwent baseline anorectal manometry (ARM) with a 16channel water perfused high resolution manometry system. For those with DD, BFT was done using manometry-based technique on weekly/ twice weekly schedule, each session lasting 20-30 minutes. Maximum 4 sessions done before result analysis. Baseline and post BFT symptom diary and manometry parameters were evaluated. Results Thirty patients (median age 30 years ) were included in study. Median symptom duration was 2 years (range [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] ; with 43% patients on >=2 laxatives. Type I DD was most common (83%). A median of 3 BFT sessions was done; 53% completed all 4 sessions. There was a significant improvement in all stool related symptoms post BFT. Significant fall in anal sphincter pressures was seen (pre vs. post BFT, vs. 65 mmHg); although rise in rectal pressures was not achieved post BFT (pre vs. post BFT, mmHg vs. 51 ) mmHg. Defecation index (DI) was significantly better post BFT (0.89 vs. 0.58, p= 0.006). Younger patients showed more likelihood to improve DI by >50% (28 vs. 42, p=0.03) . Conclusion BFT yields excellent results in patients with DD. Younger patients especially have better outcomes. Availability and expertise of BFT needs to increase in India to cater for the large population of patients with DD.",

Clinical Mayo score (CMS) and UCEIS were recorded prior to starting Tacrolimus and after 8 weeks. 5-ASA and immunomodulators were continued if the patients were already on these drugs. Clinical response at 8 weeks was defined as CMS decrease by at least 3 points. Clinical remission was defined as CMS \u22642 and combined remission as CMS\u22642 with UCEIS <3. Results The mean age of 52 patients (29 males) was 35.1\u00b112.8 years. Extent of disease was E3 in 37 (71%) patients. Thirty-one were SDUC and 21 were SRUC. Seven failed treatment within 8 weeks and 4 were subjected to surgery and 3 patients were switched to Infliximab. Three patients either discontinued Tacrolimus or were lost on follow up. Fortytwo patients continued Tacrolimus for 8 weeks. Mean CMS and UCEIS prior to starting Tacrolimus were 6\u00b11.1 and 4.8\u00b11.1 respectively. At 8 weeks median CMS and UCEIS were 2.6\u00b11.7 and 2.7\u00b11.3 respectively. Twenty-nine (56%) patients responded while 25 (48%) had CMS \u22642 and 18 out of 35 (35%) had CMS \u22642 and UCEIS <3 suggesting that they had achieved clinical and endoscopic remission. Ten patients showed partial/ no response at 8 weeks. There was a significant fall in both CMS and UCEIS at 8 weeks of Tacrolimus therapy (paired t-test p<0.001) in both SDUC and SRUC subgroups. Conclusion Tacrolimus was effective in inducing a clinical response in 56% of patients with SDUC and SRUC. In view of its low cost and safety profile it may be considered as first line therapy for SDUC/SRUC.",

Methods A prospective cross sectional study done at outpatient clinic of Gleneagles Global Health City, Chennai. Indian patients with known liver cirrhosis, irrespective of etiology, belonging to Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) B or C, with mild to moderate ascites and no dyselectrolemia and on diuretics at the time of study were included in the study. The primary outcome of the study was the need for paracentesis. The type and dose of diuretic at this instance was noted. Chi square test, Mann Whitney U test, Fischer's exact test and odds ratio were calculated. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results A total of 200 patients, predominantly from southern Indian states and 84% males formed the study group. The median model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) was 18 and 70% of cases required paracentesis within 3 months. Single diuretic agent was used in 18% of cases while combination of two diuretics was used in 82%. Spironolactone was the commonest single agent used (26, 72.2%). Combination of furosemide and spironolactone was the commonest diuretic combination used (89.6%, 147 cases). One hundred and thirty patients (65%) reported adverse effects to diuretics. Renal dysfunction and electrolyte disturbances were the commonest adverse effects. Adverse effects to diuretic use and frequency of large volume paracentesis was significantly commoner in patients taking furosemide 40 mg and spironolactone 100 mg per day. Conclusions Indian patients seldom tolerate high doses of diuretics and 65% of them develop diuretic related adverse effects. There is an urgent need formulate guidelines for optimal management of ascites in decompensated cirrhosis in Indian setting.",

Patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) have greater hemodynamic derangements than decompensated cirrhosis. There is lack of data on the incidence, diagnosis and management of PICD in ACLF. We hypothesized that there is an increased predisposition to circulatory dysfunction even with modest volume paracentesis. Methods Eighty consecutive patients of ACLF, undergoing paracentesis of 5 L were randomized to receive albumin (8 g/L of ascitic fluid, Gr A, n=40) or no albumin (Gr. B, n=40). Heart rate (HR), systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP) were monitored for 6 days. PRA were analysed at baseline, day 3 and 6. Hyponatremia was defined as Na; 130 Meq/l or 5 mEq decrease, AKI as ICA-AKI criteria; HE; grade 2 as per West Haven criteria. Results Baseline characteristics were comparable in the two groups, including mean volume of ascitic tap (4.14; 0.26; 4.16; 0.22L, p=0.80), baseline PRA, 23.2; 8.24; 20.7; 7 .03 ng/ml/hour, p=0.11), baseline HVPG(20.52; 3.63; 18.68; 3.06 mmHg, p=0.14); systemic vascular resistance (SVR, 1375 (SVR, (870, 2240 ; 1195 (719, 3116) dynes; sec; cm-5, p=0.77). PICD was more frequent in Gr B than A (70% vs. 30%; p=0.001); along with high incidence of HE (50% vs. 27.5%, p= .04), hyponatremia (67.5% vs. 22.5%, p;0.001), acute kidney injury (62.5% vs. 30%, p=0.001). On multivariate analysis, albumin infusion (OR 0.068, 95% CI .011-0.43, p=0.005), Baseline DBP (OR 0.73, 95% CI=057-.093, p=.012), MELD (OR 1.13, 95% CI=1.06-.12, p=.01) were predictor for PICD. PICD (HR 2.6, 95% p=0 .02) was predictor for mortality. PICD was associated with a higher mortality rate (26/40 [72.2%] vs. 10/40 [27.8%];0.001). Conclusions Albumin infusion decreases the incidence of PICD and mortality; is recommended as a plasma expander for modest volume tap in ACLF patients.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the colonoscopic features of suspected ICTB and prospectively evaluate the clinical and colonoscopic response after 2 and 6 months of ATT so as to identify predictors that would help to differentiate these 2 conditions at the time of diagnosis. Methodology This is a prospective study conducted in department of Gastroenterology, Calicut over a period of 2 years from August 2016 to July 2018. All patients with clinical symptoms and colonoscopic feature of ICTB were included in the study. Patients were followed up with ESR, CRP, protein, albumin and colonoscopy at 2 and 6 months for objective evidence of improvement. Results There were a total of 75 cases of ICTB patients over a period of 2 years. Out of 75 cases, 59 were successfully treated at end of 6 months with ATT. Sixteen cases did not show improvement and was reconsidered as Crohn's disease. Mean duration of symptoms was higher in Crohn's disease group (132 vs. 80.4 days) . Between these two groups, CRP reduction by 50% and increase in protein at 2 months were significantly seen in ICTB group. Colonoscopic findings of cecal pseudopolyps and ileal ulcer were seen commonly in CD group. Albumin at 2 months was lower in CD group (3.05 vs. 3.4 g/dL). At end of 2 months of ATT, 40 patients in ICTB group showed colonoscopic healing whereas only 2 patients showed healing in CD group. Conclusion Sixteen (21.3%) Crohn's disease patients were initially treated as ICTB due to diagnostic dilemma. Colonoscopic healing, serum protein and CRP help in early diagnosis and differentiation with Crohn's disease. study was conducted to determine the outcome of liver disease, especially infections and encephalopathy in patients with periodontal disease. Methodology This study was conducted in department of Gastroenterology in coordination with periodontology, Medical College, Calicut over a period of 5 months (ongoing study). All decompensated cirrhotic patients admitted were evaluated for oral hygiene and periodontal status. These patients were followed up for 12 months and etiology for frequent admissions including infections was compared with oral hygiene status by objective indices. Study patients were blinded between gastroenterologist and periodontist and data were collected separately. Results A total of 52 cirrhosis patients were enrolled during this period. Oral hygiene index (OHI) of and amp; 3 (poor OHI) was seen in 36 (69.2%) and OHI of and and ample; 3 (good OHI) was seen in 30.7%. Moderate to severe periodontits (clinical attachment loss and amp; 4) was seen in 33 (63.4%) patients. Poor OHI was significantly associated with frequent admissions (2.0 and amp; plusmn; 1.3 vs. 1.25 and mp; plusmn;1.2) and duration of CLD (2.7 and amp; plusmn; 2.6 vs. 1.1 and amp; plusmn; 1.3 years). Encephalopathy (17, 47.2%), bleed (15, 41.7%), UTI (12, 33.3%) and SBP (19.4%) were common causes for admissions in these patients. Admissions secondary to hepatic encephalopathy and GI bleed were significantly more in poor OHI group. Although cellulitis and SBP were more commonly seen in poor OHI group, they were statistically not significant. There was no difference in MELD score, ESR or ascitic fluid protein/albumin among these two groups. Conclusion Prevalence of periodontitis and poor oral hygiene was significantly higher in cirrhotic patients. Frequent admissions due to encephalopathy and infections (SBP, cellulitis) were more in patients with poor oral hygiene. Thus, frequent oral assessment and treatment may reduce incidence of infections, encephalopathy and consequently, admissions in cirrhotic patients.",

GV can also be associated with isolated splenic vein thrombosis, seen commonly in local inflammatory conditions such as pancreatitis, pancreatic malignancy or in systemic conditions such as myeloproliferateive disorders. The incidence of gastric variceal bleeding is low (10% to 20%) but the rebleeding rate is higher up to 30% with high mortality. Endo ultrasound guided GV treatment is upcoming and associated with minimal complications and rebleeding. We did a retrospective comparison of endoscopic glue injection with EUS guided coil and glue injection of GV. Methods Retrospective collection of data from June 2016 till December 2017 at ILBS and DNSH. New Delhi. Equal number of patients (20 in each arm) were recruited in both arms with follow up of at least 6 months post treatment. The inclusion criteria were GOV 2 and IGV 1, recent bleed (within 6 weeks), size of GV >10 mm (large GV) and high MELD (MELD >18). The exclusion criteria were age <18 years, failure of a valid consent, advanced hepatocellular cancer and portal vein thrombosis. Results A total of forty patients were studied. The age, sex, CTP, MELD Na score and other clinical parameters were comparable in both the arms. There were a few complications in each arm with two patients had respiratory discomfort post procedure, but no embolization was found on chest imaging and were managed conservatively. The median number of procedures and overall cost was significantly less in EUS group with near obturation of the GV. Conclusion EUS guided placement of coil and glue is equivalent in efficacy but is cheaper and requires less number of treatment sessions as compared to endoscopic treatment in patients with gastric varices and advanced liver disease.",

Before and after simulator and cadaver training, attendees completed a questionnaire onintubation, manoeuvring esophagus, stomach and duodenum for diagnostic endoscopy and scope positioning, needle out, submucosal injection and elevation of mucosa and needle in. The steps of ESDmarking, pre-cut and submucosal dissection were attempted on the stomach of human cadaver. Results Ten participants with very little prior experience of endoscopy felt the cadaver based training more beneficial in obtaining the sub mucosal plane and positioning the needle for four quadrant injection as compared to the endoscopic simulator (ES).The attendees felt that while ES has the advantage of providing feedback for the procedure, training on cadaver gave more realistic tactile experience and feel of the elasticity of the gut wall. Overall, diagnostic endoscopy was comparable in both cadaver and simulator except for difficulty in intubation in the former due to supine cadaver position. The steps of ESD were done only in the cadaver with limited success. Conclusion This study shows the feasibility of using human cadaver for simulation-based training programs in gastrointestinal endoscopy.",

Bibliography of potential articles was also searched. We excluded articles in languages other than English, case reports, reviews and unrelated papers. Two authors independently extracted data from all eligible studies. The primary outcome was a comprehensive clinical outcome as described above. Results Of total 673 records found in search, three studies on peritoneal tuberculosis were included in meta-analysis. These papers were deemed to be of poor quality (one quasi-randomized study and two retrospective cohort studies). The outcomes were analyzed using random-effects models. Meta-analyses showed adjunctive steroids with ATT is more effective than ATT alone in tuberculous peritonitis patients for the prevention of composite end-point (RR 0.15 [0.04, 0 .62], p=0.008). The use of steroids also appeared to have a benefit in prevention of symptomatic stricture and need for surgery. Conclusion The data on use of steroids for abdominal tuberculosis is limited to peritoneal tuberculosis. Although steroids seem to have some benefit in patients of tubercular peritonitis, the poor quality of studies limits the generalisation of the findings.",

Aims The prevalence, complications and predictors of HRQoL and survival in cirrhotic patients with LVDD were studied. Methods We report a prospective cohort study of 145 consecutive cirrhotic patients with LVDD who were evaluated for cardiac functional status at enrolment and followed up for hepatic complications, cardiac events, outcome and HRQoL using the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) over a period of 2 years. Results In total, 145 patients were included (mean age 61 years, 59% male). Nineteen patients died (median duration of follow up 20 months). The mean Child-Pugh (CTP) and MELDNa scores were 8.9 and 16.3. The parameters that were significant for predicting mortality were CTP, MELD, and MELDNa, HVPG, and LV diastolic function (e' and E/e' ratio). The E/e' ratio (8.7\u00b13.3 in survivors vs. 9.1\u00b12.3 in non-survivors) predicted outcome. The predictors of poor HRQOL were the CTPscore \u22659.8 (OR 4.6; 95% CI 2.3-9.1, p=0.041), MELD score \u226515.7 (OR 6.6; 95% CI 3.3-12.1, p=0.033 ), refractory ascites (OR 2.6; 95% CI 1.3-6.1, p=0.050), and E/e' ratio \u22657.6 (OR 3.6; 95% CI 1.8-7.1, p=0.036).

We planned to determine the relationship of presence, nature and quantify mucosa associated Candida (MAC) with the disease severity in patients with UC. Methods In a prospective study of UC (n=96) and non-UC controls (n=20), clinical, endoscopic, histological and serological assessment was performed for disease severity. MAC was considered to be present if mucosal biopsy culture grew Candida. Mucosal brush cytology and brush culture was also performed. Candida species identification was done by MALDI. Serum \u03b2-D-Glucan was measured by Fungitell assay. Seven UC patients with evidence of Candida were treated with oral Fluconazole and re-evaluated after 14 days. Data is analyzed using SPSS and p<0.05 was considered to be significant. Background Chronic constipation is classified clinically into FC and IBS-C based on Rome IV criteria. It is not known if there are differences in anorectal manometry in these two clinical entities. Aim of the study To determine differences in anorectal manometry parameters in patients with FC and IBS-C based on clinical presentation and gender. Methods This is a multicentre retrospective study. Baseline demographic details and symptoms pertaining to bowel movements were obtained from the records prior to ARM. Baseline investigations included fasting blood sugar with HbA1C, TSH and serum calcium. The Rome IV definitions for FC and IBS-C were used to classify the patients. We excluded patients below 18 years, fecal incontinence, posthemorrhoidectomy or fissurectomy. The data was analyzed using appropriate statistical tests. A p value <0.05 was considered significant. Results Out of 628 patients evaluated, 430 (322 males, 74.8%) fulfilled the selection criteria. 317 (73%) patients had FC. Amongst men, none of the parameters were significantly different between FC and IBS-C. However, women with FC had significantly higher complaints of an incomplete evacuation (p<0.0002) with significant difference in balloon expulsion in IBS-C (p <0.0008).

However, no standard practice guidelines exist in India. We conducted a nationwide survey to understand the prevailing practices in the management of dyspepsia in India. Methods We prepared a 19-point questionnaire using Delphi method after involving dyspepsia experts in the country. A nationwide online survey of 834 practicing gastrointestinal (GI) physicians was conducted in this regard. Results The respondents included GI physicians from both government and private sectors. Over 75% were qualified DM gastroenterologists. Dyspepsia was a common GI disorder and most GI physicians saw minimum 25 patients with dyspepsia per week. The common symptoms were combination of post prandial fullness (76%); epigastric discomfort (73%); bloating (69%); epigastric burning (50%) and epigastric pain (46%). Most opined that about 10% to 50% patients with dyspepsia had overlapped with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) like symptoms and 10% to 50% had gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). About 50% patients are subjected to endoscopy by most physicians. 75% opined that up to 10% to 25% have some endoscopic findings such as peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal cancers. Testing for H. pylori was not performed by most of the respondents if upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGIE) was \"normal\". When performed, it was done using rapid urease test (RUT) (85%) on antral biopsies (70%). The triple therapy (OAC) of 14 day duration was implemented by 85% respondents. However, most (88%) did not confirm eradication of H. pylori after treatment completion. Conclusion Dyspepsia is a common in India.

Currently liver transplantation is the only curative option, but is limited due to non-availability of quality donor organs. Repopulation of decellularized xenogeneic organs is one of the emerging technologies for development of humanized organs for regenerative applications. Methods Male Wister rats were housed at 24\u00b0C\u00b12\u00b0C temperature, 55%\u00b15% humidity and at 12h dark light cycle. Decellularized rat liver scaffold (DLS) recellularized with 10 X 106 EpCAM+ve enriched human hepatic progenitor cells (hHPCs). MTT cell assay was carried out to estimate the repopulation efficiency of cells within the DLS. ALF model was developed by injecting D-GalN intra-peritoneally. Rats were received recellularized liver and compared with only hepatocyte transplant and control group. Clinical and histopathological parameters were performed before and after transplantation. Results Complete liver Decellularization through hepatic artery perfusion within 20 h. Cells were infused into the DL during static culture provided better repopulation efficiency (>80%). Abundant secretion of albumin and urea was found in 2D culture system. D-Gal N induced ALF model development was identified using histological analysis of liver tissues. After intraperitoneal transplantation of humanized liver grafts at 16-24 hours post-DGal injection, all the animals recovered immediately and represented >80% survival after 30 days. Retrieved humanized liver grafts at post-transplantation didn't show fibrotic reactions. Prothrombin time showed fastest recovery, blood ammonia level was also reduced and liver function parameter revealed faster improvement in serum bilirubin and albumin levels in group which received recellularized liver.

There is little information on recurrence of web after endoscopic dilation. The objective of present study was to analyze the prevalence and predisposing factors for recurrence of web after endoscopic dilation. Methods All case records of patients who underwent endoscopic dilation and follow up for esophageal webs between the years 2011 and 2016 were included. Demographic details and information regarding duration of symptoms, associated diseases, presence of PVS, type of dilator used, diameter of dilation, compliance to iron therapy and findings on oral cavity examination were collected. Results During the study period, 72 patients were diagnosed with esophageal web. Mean age was 40.57\u00b110.68 years with a majority (76.4%) having dysphagia for more than one year. There was a female preponderance (83.3%) with a female to male ratio of 5:1. Most (80.6%) of them had PVS. A significantly higher proportion of men (54.5%) had associated oral lichen planus than women (15.2%) (p=0.011). The recurrence of esophageal web after dilation was 23.6%. On univariate analysis of risk factors, diameter of initial dilation <13 mm (OR 5.75, p=0.004), poor compliance with iron therapy (OR 6.95, p=0.009) and marked oropharyngeal pigmentation (p<0.0001) were found to be significantly associated with recurrence. However, on multivariate analysis, none of the risk factors could predict recurrence. Conversely, factors not found to be significantly associated with recurrence were age, gender, duration of dysphagia, type of dilator and associated oral lichen planus. Conclusion In conclusion, nearly one in four patients had recurrence of web following endoscopic dilation.

Benign pharyngoesophageal strictures (PES) may affect 3% to 7% of patients submitted to head and neck as well as esophageal cancer therapy making such dilatation technically challenging. The objective was to describe the safety, efficacy and our experience with fluoroscopically guided Savary-Gilliard (SG) dilations of esophageal strictures. Methods This study was carried out at Madras Medical College on consecutive patients with dysphagia from September 2017 to March 2018. Dilation was performed according to standard clinical practice with or without local anesthesia. Dilation was performed with Savary-Gilliard polyvinyl dilators (Wilson-Cook Medical) over a spring-tip stainless steel guidewire that was advanced transnasal under fluoroscopy to the stomach. Depending on the tightness of the stricture, dilator was passed during each session, usually according to the rule of three. Results Fifty-one transnasal esophageal SG dilatations were performed in 35 patients. The mean age of the cohort was 56 years (17-68 years). Twenty patients were male (57%). Pharyngeal and cervical esophageal Introduction Refractory benign strictures of the esophagus after acid ingestion can present a significant clinical challenge and may require repeated attempts at dilatation. Intralesional triamcinolone injections have been used in a limited number of studies to aid in the dilatation of benign, refractory esophageal strictures. The purpose of this study was to assess if steroid injection reduces the need for serial endoscopic dilatations and aids in maintaining oesophageal patency. Methodology We included all patients who presented with history of acid ingestion and were refractory to endoscopic bougie dilation with Savary-Gilliard dilator. Triamcinolone (40 mg/mL, 1 mL diluted 1:1 with saline solution) was injected via sclerotherapy needle in a four quadrantic manner in aliquots of 0.5 mL each into the proximal end of the stricture and also into the stricture itself after dilatation every 2 weeks for 2 months. The patients were followed up for 1 year. Number of dilations needed before and after steroid injection and dysphagia score was noted for each patient. Results Twenty-eight patients were enrolled for the study. Mean age of the patients were 22.74 years and 16 were females. Mean number of dilations needed before steroid injection were significantly more than after steroid injection (p<.0001). Mean maximum esophageal dilation achieved before injection was 10.6+0.8 mm, which increased significantly to 14.6+ 0.9 mm (p < 0.01). Mean dysphagia score also improved significantly from 2.64\u00b10.52 to 0.81\u00b10.35 before and after steroid injection respectively (p<0.001). The periodic dilatation index defined as number of dilatations per month also decreased significantly from 1.84\u00b10.8 before injection to 0.6\u00b10.2 after injection (p<0.001). Conclusion This study demonstrates the efficacy of triamcinolone intralesional steroids in reducing the requirement for repeated dilatations in refractory esophageal strictures after acid ingestion.",

This study was conducted to describe clinical, endoscopic, pathological appearance and outcomes following surgical and endoscopic management of esophageal cancer in tertiary care hospital at south India. Methods Total one hundred patients with esophageal cancer treated at a tertiary referral center at Madras Medical College has been analyzed retrospectively for various presentations. Treatment modalities and outcomes. Results Among one hundred patients, only twenty cases have been managed surgically by transhiatal or transthoracic esophagectomy for curative indent. Remaining cases because of its late presentation managed by non-operative measures, which includes palliative chemoradiotherapy, esophageal selfexpanding metal stents for tracheoesophageal fistula and progressive dysphagia. Few cases managed with parenteral nutrition, nasogastric or feeding jejunostomy. Most of patients were younger than fifty years of age. Conclusion Even though esophageal cancer one of leading cause of gastrointestinal cancer related deaths in India. Many patients present late to hospitals, only for palliative care because of its rapid progression and aggressive nature. In this present study lot of younger patients presented with esophageal cancer at third and fourth decades of life, we may have to seriously study the etiopathogenic reason behinds the younger age of onset of esophageal cancer. Like colonic cancer screening in western countries, Here we may have to implements prophylactic screening for esophageal cancer after forty years.",

This study is to identify the prevalence of different types of esophageal strictures, their response to dilatation, and management of refractory esophageal strictures. Methods Patients who underwent dilatation in Department of Gastroenterology, from January 2015 to December 2017 for esophageal strictures were included in the study. Results Out of 156 patients, 87 (55.76%) were males and 69 (44.23%) were females. Seventeen years was the youngest age and oldest was 75 years old. Average age was 43.26\u00b14.2 yrs. Corrosive stricture was observed in 71 patients (45.51%), peptic stricture in 33 patients (21.15%), post-radiation stricture in 29 patients (18.58%), anastomotic stricture in 21 patients (13.46%) and post EST stricture in 2 (1.2%) patients. In corrosive injury, mid and upper esophagus (68.2%) was the common site of stricture formation. Radiation stricture was more observed in mid esophagus (58.64%), peptic stricture and post EST stricture were common in lower 1/3rd of esophagus. Multiple esophageal strictures were observed in 4 (5.63%) patients in corrosive group. Refractory strictures were also highest in corrosive injury (9 patients), followed by radiation stricture (4 patients) and peptic stricture (2 patients). Average number of dilatations needed was 3.24 in corrosive stricture, 1.68 in peptic stricture, and 2.49 in radiation stricture. Four patients with refractory strictures received steroid injection with dilatation, and one patient underwent SEMS placement. Conclusion Corrosive strictures are the most common cause of esophageal strictures in our study than peptic strictures, and they are more refractory to dilatations. Dilatations combined with steroid injections, and self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) can be considered as effective treatment in refractory esophageal strictures.",

Chronic liver disease (CLD) is associated with immune dysfunction which is caused by acquired alteration of both innate and acquired immunity. Thus, CLD being an immunocompromised state leads to higher predisposition to develop EC. The data from the Western countries elucidate CLD as an independent risk factor for EC. In this study, we have retrospectively analyzed the prevalence of EC in patients of CLD with portal hypertension (PHTN). Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 650 consecutive patients of CLD with PHTN who underwent upper GI endoscopy at GMCH, Chandigarh during period of September 2017 to June 2018. All patients who were positive for HIV were excluded from the study. The diagnosis of EC was primarily based on endoscopic findings and KOH preparations. Prevalence of EC in patients of CLD with PHTN was determined. We also did risk analysis for variables like age, sex, alcohol consumption, presence of co-morbidities and drugs: herbal medication or corticosteroids use. Factors which were independently associated with EC were determined. Results The prevalence of EC in patients of CLD with PHTN was found to be 4.0% (26/650). The mean age was higher in those diagnosed with esophageal candidiasis (54.52\u00b111.09 years, total mean age=48.13\u00b113.3 years). We also observed use of herbal medication in the patient under study, but its association was found insignificant (p-value=.0048; p<.01). But no significant association was found with gender, alcohol consumption, DM, CAD, CKD or PPIs use. Conclusion This study identified prevalence of OC in CLD with PHTN in Indian scenario as 4%. It was consistent with prevalence range of 0.3% to 7.3% in non-HIV-infected patients observed in previous studies.",

This is a discomforting and prolonged process. Many of these patients usually undergo an upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy also. This current study aims to demonstrate a way of measuring static pH of the upper gastrointestinal tract by passing a catheter through the biopsy channel of upper GI endoscope during the procedure of upper GI endoscopy. Method We measured the pH of the patients who came for routine diagnostic upper GI endoscopy for upper abdominal symptoms at the International Gastro Institute, Vadodara, Gujarat. We excluded those patients who had taken any acid release inhibiting medications in last one week and those having comorbid illnesses like cirrhosis of liver or malignancy. Routine diagnostic upper GI endoscopy was done using a Fujinon 600 series endoscope. The pH catheter was calibrated and then passed through biopsy channel of the upper GI endoscope. The pH of 3 parts of the upper GI was measured during the endoscopy. These includelower esophagus, stomach and first part of duodenum. After measuring the pH the catheter tip was tested in vitro by putting it into acidic and basic solutions to reconfirm the correctness of pH reading. Results The pH measurements were done using the above described process in 355 patients over a period starting October 2017 till date. We analyzed the data in first consecutive 30 patients. Conclusion We present an accurate and simple method of measuring pH of upper GI tract. The pH measurements are easily reproducible and will have many therapeutic and research applications.",

Methods We analyzed data from January 2017 to July 2018 of biopsy negative highly suspicious malignant stricture. All adult patients with at least two negative biopsies and having smooth overlying mucosa on endoscopy were included in study. Clinical, epidemiological, endoscopic, imaging and EUS findings were noted and analyzed. Results Seventeen patients were underwent EUS for suspicion of malignant esophageal stricture. Seven cases excluded as they were sub mucosal tumor causing luminal compromise in which EUS is standard procedure. Ten patients had linitus type esophageal involvement causing tight stricture. Male:Female ratio was 7:3. Computed tomography scan showed esophageal wall thickening in 6 (median:24 mm, range:16-38 mm), while esophageal mass in 4. EUS showed loss of normal five layered wall structure of esophagus in all patients and additionaly mass was seen in 4 patients. FNAC revealed squamous cell carcinoma (n=4), adenocarcinoma (n=3), poorly differentiated carcinoma (n=2) and neuroendocrine carcinoma (n=1). There were no complications related to EUS.

EUS showed 7x 6 cms variegated heteroechoic right paracardiac mass, abutting left atrium suggestive of pleuropericardial cyst/leiomyoma. FNA was suggestive of cystic lesion. Patient was offered surgery. In our centre EUS was repeated and showed a cystic mass seen in the posterior-lateral surface measuring 5 x 4.5 x 3.7 cm. Both hypoechoic and isoechoic content with air in the mass causing artifacts, wrapped by esophageal muscularis. EGD showed ulcerated surface with thick margins and pus/white discharge extruding from the ulcerated base. Few openings leading from ulcer surface seen. Pus/discharge was aspirated and sent for cytology, TC, DC and culture which confirmed infection. The diagnoses was esophageal duplication cyst-infected post FNA.

Dilatation of stricture using bougie dilators is an effective endoscopic modality in providing relief to the patients. In this study, we aim to analyse the etiological and endoscopic profile of benign esophageal stricture dilatations done in our department. Methods We retrospectively analyzed data of patients who had undergone esophageal stricture dilatation using Savary-Gillard bougie dilator at our centre over a period of 1 year from August 2017 to July2018. Results A total of 108 patients of benign esophageal stricture had undergone dilatation, out of which 32 were male and 76 were female. The mean age of patients was 49.2 years. Most common etiology was post cricoid web (51.9%), followed by postradiotherapy stricture (23.1%), corrosive stricture (17.6%), peptic stricture (5.6%) and anastomotic stricture (1.8%). The most common etiology was post cricoid web in both the genders, even though the M:F ratio in post cricoid web was 1:3.3. Seventeen patients had complex strictures, which included both long segment and multiple stricture. Complex strictures were most commonly seen with corrosive injury (11 out of 17). The average diameter of dilatation achieved in post cricoid web (13.3 mm) was higher compared to that of post radiotherapy stricture (12.1mm) and corrosive stricture (12.4 mm). The average number of dilatations undergone over 1 year period were also more in postradiotherapy and corrosive strictures. Conclusion Post cricoid web is the major cause of benign esophageal stricture and has better response to dilatation. Complex strictures are more commonly found in corrosive injury and are more refractory to dilatation. The incidence of peptic strictures have come down probably with the increasing use of proton pump inhibitors.",

It is an alarming symptom which needs detailed evaluation and prompt treatment. Endoscopy is the most valuable tool in evaluation of dysphagia. Aim Aim was to study the clinical profile and endoscopic findings in patients presenting with dysphagia as a primary complaint in our centre from June 2017 to July 2018. Method It was a retrospective study of the patients who presented with dysphagia as primary complaint in our centre from July 2017 to June 2018. Inclusion Criteria: All patients with new onset dysphagia were included in study. Exclusion Criteria: Patients with neurological dysphagia were excluded from study. Results Total number of 284 patients (163 male and 121 females) were included and index endoscopy was performed. Common findings at endoscopy were Ca cricopharynx and Ca esophagus (39.4%), PC web and Schatzki ring (27.5%), post radiation stricture (11.2%). Other less common causes Introduction Tuberculosis (TB) is a life-threatening disease which can affect virtually any organ system. India has the world's highest tuberculosis case burden (around 25% of the world TB cases). Primary involvement of the stomach is rare (0.4%-2%). Case presentation A 30-year-old male, presented with epigastric pain, high grade fever and significant weight loss. On examination epigastric lump (8 X 7 cm) felt, investigation revealed anemia, polymorphonuclear leukocytosis. Patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics based on ultrasound finding of Left lobe liver abscess, fever persisted in spite of course of antibiotics. CT Scan showed asymmetrical thickening in body and fundus of stomach, hepatic SOL. Endoscopy showed diffuse nodular lesions in gastric body, pus extruded from nodule. Gastric biopsy showed chronic gastritis. Xpert MTB/ RIF Assay for tuberculosis was negative twice. PET-CT showed metabolically active tumor of stomach with liver infiltration. Liver SOL biopsy inconclusive. Repeat gastric biopsy was done and sent for Xpert MTB/RIF Assay which turned out to positive/sensitive to rifampicin. The patient was prescribed four drug ATT (HRZE), after 6 months of ATT now patient is afebrile, follow up CT show satisfactory improvement in lesion. Discussion Endoscopic biopsy is occasionally successful in diagnosis. Due to inaccurate clinical diagnoses, most patients end up requiring surgical intervention, only after which is gastric tuberculosis diagnosed. Regarding the present case, we were able to demonstrate neither AFB bacilli, nor granulomas, but we did obtain a positive PCR test from the endoscopic biopsy. In the case of extrapulmonary specimens, the sensitivities of smear (51%) and culture (53%), though comparable, were found to be low in comparison with that of the Xpert test (81%). Conclusion This case highlights varied presentation of gastric tuberculosis and importance of Xpert MTB/RIF assay in diagnosis of TB which was not picked up by biopsy/culture, which particularly obviating the necessity of operation.",

The disease was first reported in 1989, only 60 cases have been documented in the English literature [1] . Case report A 54-year-old female presented with recurrent post prandial vomiting and 6 kg weight loss in last 6 months. She had a recent onset diarrhea for 2 days. She has diabetes melitus since 2003 and hypertension since 2007. She was treated with tab. Olmesartan 40 mg once daily since 2016. Her physical examination and investigations were unremarkable. Her symptoms were not relieved with conservative treatment. Her UGI scopy revealed atrophic mucosa with nodularity in body region. NBI showed tubular micromucosal pattern. Her colonoscopy was normal. HPE report was suggestive of thick collagen deposition (>10 micron) entrapping the subepithelial vessels, inflamed mucosa and epithelial injury. Discussion Endoscopic findings in CG have been characterized by fine nodularity surrounded by depressed, atrophic mucosa [1] . Pathologically, dense collagen depositions are found in the intervening atrophied mucosa [1, 2] . Kawamura et al. [3] reported that a tubular gastric micromucosal pattern under M-NBI is representative of infiltration of inflammatory cells, while an obscure surface structure with irregular, narrowed, and coiled subepithelial capillaries is compatible with mucosal atrophy and intestinal metaplasia. Conclusion Our case suggests that the co-existence of these two distinctive NBI finding with history of olmesartan use may be diagnostic of CG. The stomach cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world. The photodynamic effects leading in fluorescent gastroscopy is promising optical technique for non-invasive tumor diagnosis. However, this method is less effective for diagnosis of pre-cancer in gastrointestinal tract that requests improvement of photodiagnostic technique. In our study, we presented an effective improvement of fluorescent gastroscopy by application of new conjugate between photosensitizer such as zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) with newly synthesized polymer brushes (copolyimide with regularly grafted side chains of polymethacrylic acid) (PB) as drug carriers in comparison with the standard photodynamic diagnosis by using of phthalocyanine solely. For formation of adenocarcinoma in rats n=200, we used our original model using combined effects of stress overpopulation for 9 months +nitrosamine diet (toluidine 2 g/kg in food and water with nitrites 2 g/l). For photodynamic diagnosis of gastric tumor, we used physiological solutions of ZnPc, ZnPc-PB conjugates (1 mg/kg, I.V.) and 5-ALA/PpIX (20 mg/kg, per os) histological method was performed to analyze the changes in the gastric tissues. The comparative analysis of two photosensitizers combined with histological analysis of gastric tissues showed that fluorescent signal (FS) from 5-ALA/PpIX was higher than from ZnPc in rats with tumor. However, using of ZnPc solely was ineffective for observation of pre-cancer changes in stomach. Only 5-ALA/PpIX expressed enough strong FS from precancerous gastric lesions. To improve diagnostic effectiveness of ZnPc, we applied PB conjugates that increased the photosensitizer penetration in the cells. The FS from conjugate from precancerous gastric area was similar by value with the 5-ALA / PpIX fluorescence. Thus, using PB as drug carriers, we have achieved a significant improvement in the diagnostic ZnPc potential, demonstrating a significant increase in FS from precancerous mucosal areas.

Its also common in other parts of India. However, data on various clinicopathological characteristics of gastric cancer patients in different region is limited. The aim of this study was to find out the epidemiological, pathological and clinical profile of gastric cancer patients presenting to above mentioned centre during study period. Methods Three hundred and fifty cases of gastric cancer patients were included in this multicenter study. Patient characteristics were obtained using pretested questionnaire. All relevant investigations like endoscopy, biopsy reports, HPE and operative notes wherever available were recorded. Results Average age of the patients was 41.36 years. There were 290 (79%) males and 60 (21%) females. Fifty-one percent of the patients came from rural areas while the rest (49%) resided in urban areas. Weight loss was the commonest symptom followed by dyspepsia and abdominal pain. Majority of them were smokers (81%). Antrum was the commonest site of involvement and most common type of lesion was ulceroproliferative type (60%). Most of the gastric cancers were poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas. Indeterminate type was the commonest histological subtype. Eleven percent of patients deemed operable on preoperative workup had advanced unresectable cancers. Conclusions Majority of the gastric cancer patients appear to be male, smoker and mostly with a rural background. The average age at diagnosis was 41 years. Commonest symptoms were weight loss and dyspepsia. A high percentage of the patients were smokers with a long duration of smoking. About half of the patients had poorly differentiated cancers and indeterminate histology. A significant number of cases presented late with advanced disease.

Isolated collagenous gastritis is confined to pediatric population. We present a rare case of isolated collagenous gastritis in an adult female associated with H pylori gastritis and clinical response to anti H pylori treatment. Methods A 35-years-female complained of post prandial abdominal distension, vomiting and weight loss of 6 kg in 4 months. Evaluation revealed iron deficiency anemia. Vitamin B 12 was normal. Celiac profile and ANA were negative. Endoscopy revealed antral narrowing with mucosal abnormality. Deep pre-pyloric ulcer was noted and RUT was positive. Mucosal biopsy showed inflammatory markers in lamina propria. H pylori was seen. Suggestive of H pylori gastritis. Anti-H pylori treatment given. As the symptoms persisted, repeat endoscopy after 1 month showed gastric mucosal nodularity with depressed areas. Pyloric channel narrowing. Repeat biopsy revealed attenuated gastric epithelium with active inflammation. Subepithelial collagen plate was thickened. Suggesting, collagenous gastritis. H pylori was seen. Colonoscopy and biopsy were normal. Endoscopy after 3 months revealed smooth mucosa with pre-pyloric scarring, reduced thickness of collagen band and no H pylori. Results Patient responded well to 2nd line anti H pylori treatment, vomiting decreased, weight and anemia improved. Conclusion Collagenous gastritis is diagnostically challenging disease and its exact etiology remains unclear. This is a rare case of isolated collagenous gastritis in adults with H pylori association. This case responded well to H pylori eradication, from which we can assume H pylori as a probable cause for collagenous gastritis.

Recent published data suggest adverse effects of short-term and long-term PPI therapy cautioning indiscriminate prescription. Aims To audit appropriateness of PPI prescription in adult non-ICU and ICU patients in a tertiary care centre. Methods A prospective cross-sectional audit was carried out at Mazumdar Shaw Medical Center which does not include the NH cardiac centre, after obtaining consent from empanelled doctors. For a period of one week, all hospitalized patients on PPI, H2RA and antacids, aged 18 and above, were identified and indications considered appropriate for the use of PPI based on current literature and guidelines were noted. Details of the primary treating departments, co-morbidities, use of aspirin and NSAID's were also noted. Results A total of 280 patients were surveyed, of which 119 (42.5%) patients were on acid suppressant therapy. One hundred and one (84.8%) patients were on PPI, 10 (8.4%) on H2RA, 6 (5.04%) on multiple drugs and rest 2 (1.6%) on antacids. Majority of patients (66.12%) received PPI in intravenous form. Inappropriate use was noted in 83 patients (69.74%) and it was significantly higher in ICU (55.26%) than in non-ICU (41.84%) patients. Appropriate use was noted in patients with GI bleed, on NSAIDS and endoscopic evidence of acid peptic disease. Inappropriate prescribing was more common amongst male patients, surgical admissions and non-upper GI bleeders Conclusion Indiscriminate and inappropriate PPI use was noted to be common in both ICU and non-ICU patients. With increasing literature on potential harmful side effects of PPI use over short and long-term, it is necessary to educate practising physicians and surgeons to prescribe PPI judiciously.",

Methods We conducted a study on 937 patients with an aim to compare 2 serology H pylori kits with the gold standard i.e. biopsy findings. The samples were collected from the patients who attended OPD from January 2011 to April 2017. Serology kits used in the study were H pylori Ag ELISA (Standard Diagnostic USA) and on-site H pylori Ag rapid test (CTK Biotech, USA). Histological examination of gastroduodenal biopsy specimens was considered as gold standard. Results While biopsy is the current gold standard for diagnosis of H pylori infection of the gastrointestinal tract, other non-invasive methods are rapidly catching up. Biopsy findings of 937 patients in our study revealed 561 as H pylori positive and 376 as negative. From the results obtained from our study, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of SD kit were 15.82%, 95.50%, 73.53% and 58.95% respectively; and of CTK kit were 36.48%, 75.45%, 84.48% and 24.48%. This is in sharp contrast to the 8 kit comparison by Wilcox et al. which reports sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV averaging at 96.37%, 91.62%, 91.87% and 99.25% respectively. The wide differences in values indicate the need for a better serology diagnostic kit. If the aim of non-invasive diagnostic techniques is to someday replace the existing invasive gold standard investigations, a better collated result with the biopsy findings is highly desirable. Till that time biopsy is the only irrefutable test in our armamentarium.

It represents a significant diagnostic and treatment challenge. We report a rare such case with gastric and hepatic involvement presenting with GI bleed. Case Report A 68-year-old male admitted with complaints of loss of appetite and weight loss of 10 kg in 6 months. He was hypertensive on medications. Basic blood investigations were within normal limits. USG abdomen -hepatosplenomegaly, CECT abdomen -coarse echotexture of liver, splenomegaly, multiple anterior abdominal wall collaterals and periportal lymphadenopathy. Upper GI endoscopy -thickened gastric mucosa, superficial ulcers, and active diffuse oozing of blood wherever the scope touches the mucosa (extreme friability), small duodenal submucosal nodule also noted. Gastric and duodenal nodule biopsy was suggestive of amyloidosis, Congo red staining was positive for classic green birefringence under polarized light. Serum protein electrophoresis and bone marrow aspiration were negative for myeloma. He was treated conservatively. Discussion The disease results from the deposition of insoluble extracellular protein fragments that have been rendered resistant to digestion. GIA can be acquired or genetic, and most commonly results from chronic inflammatory disorders (AA), hematologic malignancy (AL), and ESRD (Beta-2). Within GI tract, amyloid deposition occurs in the muscularis mucosae, within close proximity to vasculature, nerves, and nerve plexuses. This deposition increases the frailty of blood vessels, hinders intrinsic peristalsis and decreases the compliance of the gut wall. Treatment is based on addressing the underlying etiology for elevated amyloid precursors and most often involves chemotherapy or biologic therapy. Prognosis depends on subtype. AL subtype typically shows worse prognosis than AA subtype, and those with GI involvement typically have worse outcomes. Conclusion GIA is a rare entity, diagnosis depends on clinical acumen, high index of suspicion and histopathology 090 Upper gastrointestinal involvement in inflammatory bowel disease patients of North Kerala Introduction The incidence of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is increasing in India and particularly in Kerala. The clinical correlation between upper gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations and disease process in IBD is under reported. This cross-sectional study evaluated the prevalence of macroscopic and microscopic upper GI lesions in IBD patients with no upper GI symptoms in a tertiary care hospital of North Kerala. Methodology Consecutive asymptomatic IBD patients were recruited for the study with upper GI endoscopy and biopsies between January 2018 and July 2018 in Department of Gastroenterology, Medical College, Calicut. Results One hundred and fifteen IBD patients (44 CD, 71 UC; 58.3% male 41.7% female; mean age 40\u00b115 years) were included. Endoscopic gastroduodenal involvement of CD was 29.5% and in UC 42.2% (p=0.242) but histology was significantly abnormal in CD than UC (63.6% vs. 45.1%, p = 0.05). H pylori (Hp) positivity was similar in both (9% vs. 7% p=0.65). Common endoscopic finding in CD patients was gastritis (20.4%), duodenal erosions (9.1%) and aphthae (4.5%) while in UC it was gastric ulcerations and erosions (29.5%), erythema (18.4%) and duodenal erosions (7.1%). In CD 31.8% and 29.6% of UC with normal endoscopic findings had abnormal histopathology. Patients with higher disease activity CDAI >150, Truelove-Witts score moderate or more had abnormal histopathology even in the presence of normal endoscopy. Common histopathology findings in CD included Hp negative chronic active gastritis (34.1%), duodenitis (31.8%), granuloma (6.8%) while in UC, Hp negative chronic active gastritis (43.7%), duodenitis (16.9%) and gastric basal mixed infiltrates (11.3%). Endoscopic findings were less common in Azathioprine (AZA) and aminosalicylic acid users (p=0.05) while histopathology was better in AZA users (p=0.03).",

Narrow band imaging (NBI) helps in enhanced visualization of mucosal microscopic structure and capillaries in the superficial mucosal layer. This study was done to find out the correlation of NBI microvascular findings of the stomach with HPI. Methods Consecutive patients with dyspeptic symptoms who underwent endoscopic examination from October 2017-July 2018 were enrolled. After conventional endoscopy, NBI was used to examine the stomach and the predominant vascular pattern was studied. Visualized mucosa was classified into one of the 3 patterns. Type 1slightly enlarged, round pits with unclear or irregular subepithelial capillary networks. Type 2: obviously enlarged, oval or prolonged pits with increased density of irregular vessels. Type 3: well-demarcated, oval or tubulovillous pits with clearly visible coiled or wavy vessels of subepithelial capillary networks. Biopsy done from the predominant pattern was evaluated for HPI.

Histology is a reliable diagnostic test for H pylori infection, but its performance status is affected by PPI overuse. We have tried to assess its impact on the gastric mucosal biopsy and suggest some measures to improve the outcome of the various diagnostic tests. Methods Fifty consecutive dyspeptic patients requiring endoscopy who had been on oral PPI therapy for more than 3 months were included in the study prospectively. Endoscopic mucosal biopsies were taken from the antrum and body of the stomach separately and the tissue sections were stained with H&E, Giemsa and immunohistochemistry for H pylori antigen. Rapid urease test (RUT) was also performed on tissues obtained from antrum and antrum plus corpus. Readings were taken at 5 minutes, 4 hours and 24 hours. Results Out of 50 patients, 36 were male and 14 were female. The mean age was 44+16.82 years. RUT was positive from the antral mucosa in (19/50) 38%, (24/50) 47% and (26/50) 52% cases at 5 minutes, 4 hours and 24 hours reading respectively. When the antrum and corpus were combined, the corresponding values were (25/50) 50%, (33/50) 65% and (41/50) 82% respectively. Histopathologically H pylori was positive in (26/50) 52% of PPI exposed dyspeptic patients when both antrum and corpus were included, whereas the detection rate was (34/50) 67.6% with the IHC technique. Even though the difference is not statistically significant (p value=0.17) because of small sample size, it shows an upward trend. Conclusion It is desirable to include both antrum and corpus mucosal tissue for RUT and histopathology in PPI exposed patients. IHC as an ancillary technique improves H pylori detection rate and RUT reading at 5 hours is as good as IHC results.",

            "text": "Background Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a prevalent condition imposing health care burden, impaired quality of life, and a therapeutic challenge due to non-specific symptoms. FD symptoms and delayed gastric emptying are often seen in and further worsen the quality of life in diabetic patients. Acotiamide is a first-in-class gastro-kinetic drug, enhancing acetylcholine release and representing an appropriate therapeutic option to fill the need gap in specific, and effective FD drugs. Though evidence of its efficacy and tolerance are available through randomized clinical trials, real world data from its inclinic use is lacking. Methodology Three hundred and fourteen patients with meal-related FD symptoms, visiting 63 gastroenterology clinics across India, received Acotiamide 100 mg TID for 4 weeks and were evaluated for patient's perception of improvement in presenting symptoms, and tolerance to treatment. Results Treatment response rate (complete relief or significant improvement) for the symptoms of post-prandial fullness, upper abdominal bloating and early satiety was achieved by 79.2%, 74.4%, and 77.1% patients respectively. (p<0.001 for all vs. no/slight improvement). A sub-analysis of 71 diabetic patients showed no significant difference in symptomatic relief between diabetic and non-diabetic patients (response rate for symptoms of post-prandial fullness, upper abdominal bloating and early satiety in diabetic vs. non-diabetic patients was 76.3% vs. 82.3%; p=0.81, 82.63% vs. 76%; p=0.25, and 76.2% vs. 83.2%; p=0.36, respectively). Significantly more number of patients achieved complete relief when treated for >28 days or 14-28 days than when treated for less than 2 weeks (p<0.05). Mild, transient adverse events were reported in 6% cases with only 2 patients discontinuing treatment. Conclusion This real-world study suggests that use of Acotiamide was associated with improvement of meal-related FD symptoms with in both diabetics and non-diabetic Indian patients with good safety profile.",

Our study aim was to assess the effect of SBTT on the likelihood of detecting intestinal pathology during VCE. Methods We retrospectively reviewed data on VCE studies performed at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi, India from January 2015 to January 2018. The indications for VCE and its diagnostic yield were recorded. Age, gender, study indication, and SBTT were studied as candidate factors affecting diagnostic yield. All patients received similar bowel preparation with polyethylene glycol, and none of the patients received any prokinetics. Patients who did not achieve completion were considered to have SBTT >9 hours (battery life). Results Total 438 patients were assessed; 2 patients were excluded as their capsules remained retained in the stomach. The completion rate up to cecum was 83% (364/436). The mean SBTT in patients who had complete examination was 283 (\u00b1143) minutes. The indications were: obscure gastrointestinal bleed 52%, pain abdomen 25%, suspected small bowel inflammatory bowel disease 12%, chronic diarrhea 7%, and miscellaneous 4%. Diagnostic yield was 53% (233/436) and depended on indication; being highest for chronic diarrhea group (62%) and lowest for miscellaneous group (20%). Apart from indication only other factor that influenced diagnostic yield was SBTT: patients with SBTT <300 minutes were less likely to have diagnostic yield compared to patients with SBTT \u2265300 minutes (47% vs. 60%, p=0.009). Conclusion Shorter SBTT during VCE (<300 minutes) is associated with a poorer diagnostic yield. This may be due to negative effect on image quality due to faster small bowel transit. Thus, use of prokinetic agents during VCE might adversely impact the diagnostic yield and should be discouraged.",

Methods During the mean period of 2013-2018, Patients who got admitted at department of gastroenterology, Aster MIMS, Calicut, Kerala, India with gastrointestinal complaints following food consumption from outside home/marriage function/any other function was evaluated and arrived at a diagnosis of probable food induced gastrointestinal symptoms were enrolled. Other diseases which can cause similar issues including chronic pancreatitis, IBD, bowel malignancy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and postoperative abdomen were excluded. Results Total 90 patients got admitted with GI complaints. Most common symptom was abdominal pain, followed by diarrhea, vomiting and constipation. Majority of affected belonged to age group 26-35 (21%) and above 60 yrs (18%). Males were commonly affected than females (73% vs. 27%). Majority had a duration of symptoms less than 1 week (98%). Thirty-two percent had leukocytosis and 27% had mildly elevated creatinine. Sixty-seven percent had elevated CRP and mean CRP elevation was 55.6%. Small intestinal involvement was more common. Forty-six percent had underlying diseases including DM, malignancy, CLD, CKD, asthma, rheumatologic issues. Four patients (0.04%) were having features of multiorgan failure. There were no deaths. Underlying diseases (like malignancy, CCP, colonic diverticuli, intestinal lymphoma, NET etc.) could be diagnosed after being presented with food toxemia. Conclusions Food induced toxemia presenting as partial intestinal obstruction is on the rise in North Kerala region. Due to unhealthy eating habits and adulteration, people have to suffer regarding health, Money and loss of work days. CRP is an effective marker for detecting intestinal injury. Acute kidney injury and small intestinal thickening were more often reversible. >90% of the symptoms resolved over a period of 7 days.

Gastroduodenal artery (GDA) aneurysm is among the rarest VAAs; accounting only for 1.5% of the total, second in its rarity only to inferior mesenteric artery aneurysm. Despite its rarity, it represents an important subcategory of VAAs on account of having up to 75% risk of rupture; with gastrointestinal bleeding being the presenting feature in up to 52% of cases. Case Summary A 67-years-old male patient known case of systemic hypertension on regular treatment came to emergency with the history of upper abdominal pain and passage of fresh blood per rectum. On admission he w as h emodynamic ally unsta ble . After s tabiliz ation, esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done which did not reveal source of any active bleeding and subsequent colonoscopy was done which showed presence of fresh blood in the colon and terminal ileum suggesting bleeding from the small intestine. Again endoscopy was planned as the patient has history of recent ERCP, a bleeding source was identified on side viewing endoscope, on which fresh blood noted coming out from ampulla. So, computed tomogramangiography of abdomen done which showed well defined pseudoaneurysm (2 x 2 cm diameter) typically seen at the ampullary site and is arising from the branch of gastroduodenal artery proper. As CT angiography revealed GDA aneurysm, so transcatheter embolization of the gastroduodenal artery was performed and two coils were placed in the minor branches of GDA proper. Post procedure patient hemoglobin started to stabilize and the patient was discharged home. Background and Aims Microscopic colitis (MC) is an overlooked cause of chronic diarrhea. Strict restriction of disease to colon is still unclear and may have bearing on treatment regimes. We therefore evaluated terminal ileum using narrow band imaging (NBI), high definition white light endoscopy (HDWLE) with eventual histopathological findings on biopsy. Methods Fifty-three adults with suspected MC were recruited and routine tests done. All underwent colonoscopy with ileal intubation if possible. Segmental colonic biopsies were obtained with additional biopsies from terminal ileum using HDWLE and NBI. They were analysed by expert gastrointestinal histopathologist.",

Malignancy became the most common cause of GOO in developed countries. However, literature suggests that the benign etiologies continue to be the major cause of GOO in the developing world. Methods An observational study of patients with GOO from December 2016 to June 2018, at Department of Gastroenterology, SMS Hospital, Jaipur, Rajasthan. Results A total of 105 (68 male/ 37 female) patients with GOO diagnosed. Patients with benign and malignant etiologies were 59/105 (56%) and 46/ 105 (44%), respectively. In male patients benign and malignant etiologies were 47/68 (69%) and 21/68 (31%), respectively. In female patients benign and malignant etiologies were 12/37 (32%) and 25/37 (68%), respectively. In benign cases, NSAID and opioids abuse 24/59 (41%); peptic ulcer disease 14/59 (24%); corrosive injury 10/59 (17%); chronic pancreatitis 7/59 (12%); acute pancratitis 3/59 (5%) and tuberculosis 1/59 (1.6%) were present. In malignant cases gastric carcinoma 16/46 (35%); carcinoma gallbladder 15/46 (33%); periampullary carcinoma 5/46 (11%); duodenal adenocarcinoma 4/46 (9%) were present. Other causes of malignant etiologies include GI lymphoma (2/46); duodenal neuroendocrine tumor (1/46); cholangiocarcinoma (1/46); carcinoma head of pancreas (1/46) and retroperitoneal sarcoma (1/46). Conclusion Overall benign etiologies are still most common cause of GOO in north west India, with most common causes are NSAID and opioids abuse and peptic ulcer disease. In males and females most common causes are benign and malignant, respectively. Introduction Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders may involve esophagus, stomach, small and large intestine presenting with pleomorphic manifestations. Eosinophilic enteritis (EE) is characterized by eosinohilic infiltration of small intestine without any secondary cause. Diagnosis is confirmed by histopathological examination and this entity responds dramatically to short course of steroids. Methods We retrospectively analyzed patients diagnosed with EE in our hospital between February 2014 and February 2017. We included patients with confirmed EE (histopathology showing >30 eosinophils/high power field). We analyzed their symptoms, lab data, endoscopic findings, imaging, biopsy reports, response to therapy and relapse after completion of therapy. Biopsy specimen were obtained mainly from the duodenum by using upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. If duodenal biopsy was unyielding and/or involvement of another site was obvious in CT scan, then targeted biopsy was performed. Results Over three years, 25 cases were considered but three were excluded (one each of hypereosinophilic syndrome, hookworm and round worm infestation). Remaining 22 patients were included in the study. EE was more common in males (M: F=14:8) with the mean age of 33.8 years. Pain abdomen was the most common symptom (86.4%), intestinal obstruction and ascites were seen in one patient each. History of allergy was present in 27.3% of patients. In contrary to other studies, peripheral eosinophilia was seen in 95.5% of our patients. Eighteen patients responded to steroids without relapse. One non-responder needed Azathioprine and another patient with multiple relapses is on Mycophenolate Mofetil. Conclusion EE is not uncommon in India. It should be considered in patients presenting with short duration pain abdomen with negative workup for peptic ulcer, pancreatitis and biliary problems. It has excellent response to oral corticosteroids.",

In Indian patients, enteroscopic biopsy and histology for establishing the initial diagnosis of CD is helpful in view of prevalent infections and infestations (eg: TB, Compylobactor etc.). Indian studies of biosimilar Adalimumab in CD, limited to small intestine, diagnosed by DBE are lacking. Method Total 18 patients (13 male and 5 female) with small intestinal CD, who were non-responders to mesalazine therapy, were enrolled. The mean age was 43.4 years. Diagnosis of small intestinal CD was confirmed by clinical, radiological parameter, double balloon enteroscopy (DBE), and histology. Patients were enrolled to receive subcutaneous injections of biosimilar adalimumab as per the dosing schedule (40 mg x 4-s/c at Day-1, 40 mg x 2-s/c after 2 weeks and thereafter 40 mg s/c fortnightly). Median duration was 6 months. Seven out of 18 patients agreed for repeat DBE after 6 months.",

Initially thought to occur in only a small number of patients it is now apparent that this disorder is more prevalent than previously thought. Patients with SIBO vary in presentation, from being only mildly symptomatic to suffering from chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and malabsorption. A number of diagnostic tests are currently available, although the optimal treatment regimen remains elusive. Aim To study incidence of SIBO in patients with functional dyspepsia without alarming signs and symptoms. Methods We studied 21 patients with history of bloating, abdominal pain, watery stools. These patients were asked to be fasting for 14 hours and asked to avoid milk, bread, potato, fibre, beans, legumes, nuts, soy and large meal 24 hours before the test. With the help of gastroglutolyzer basal hydrogen was recorded. 75 grams of glucose in 250 mL water was given as a test substrate to the patient and 5 breath sample were collected after every 15 minutes. H2 >20 ppm compared to basal sample within 90 minutes of substrate ingestion was considered to be positive. Results Among 21 patients, 8 (38.1%) patients were male and 13 (61.9%) were female. Ten patients (47.6%) were positive for this test. Maximum (i. e. 28.5%) number of patients were in the age group of 51 to 60 years. Nineteen percent of the patients were diabetics. All positive patients were given a course of rifaximin and ciprofloxacin for 10 days and breath test was repeated and was found to be negative in 70% of patients. Conclusion Since 70% of the patients responded to the treatment, it is essential to do hydrogen breath test and treat the patients.",

The reported prevalence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in subjects with IBS is highly variable and there is no consensus on the role of SIBO in different subtypes of IBS, and indications and methods of testing. Methods A comprehensive literature search was performed for studies applying tests for SIBO in subjects with IBS. After applying prospectively decided exclusion criteria, the eligible papers were examined using a meta-analysis approach for the prevalence of SIBO in subjects with IBS using different tests. The odds ratios (OR) of SIBO among subjects with IBS as compared to healthy controls were calculated. Results Of 49 studies (23, 18, 5, and 3 using lactulose and glucose hydrogen breath tests (LHBT and GHBT), jejunal aspirate culture, and more than one tests, respectively) meeting the inclusion criteria, 36.7% (95% CI 24.2-44.6) had a positive test for SIBO.

This study aimed to define the prevalence of USCD and compare the profile of USCD and CCD. Methods We performed a single-centered, cross-sectional, observational study where patients of malabsorption or serologic suspicion of CD were enrolled from January 2017 to June 2018. After taking history, examination, we performed hemogram, iron-profile, IgA tTG etc. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done in all patients for evaluating first and second part of the duodenum with white-light and narrow band imaging. Biopsies were obtained from first and second part of duodenum in separate containers. An histopathologist reported all the biopsies. Clinical data from patients identified as USCD, based on biopsy analysis, were compared with patients of conventional celiac disease (CCD). Results Total 143 patients were included in this study and 110 patients were diagnosed to have CD. Among them, 15 cases (13.6%) were diagnosed as USCD. The mean age, height, weight, BMI and gender ratio of USCD patients was not significantly different from CCD. Chronic diarrhea was the presenting symptoms among 64 (67.3%) patients of CCD group and 5 (33.3%) patients of the USCD group. This difference was significant (p=0.013). The family history, dermatitis herpetiformis and autoimmune disease like T1 diabetes mellitus, thyroid disorder were seen in similar frequency in both CCD and USCD group. Patients with CCD were found to have abdominal pain, anemia and weight loss more frequently as compared to patients with USCD, though these did not reach significance level.

The aim was to study ulcerative colitis patients subsequently evolving into microscopic colitis. Methods This prospective study included 53 eligible adult ulcerative colitis patients. Thirty-five patients had active disease at baseline and were followed up for 8 weeks, where as 18 patients were in remission and only baseline evaluation was done in them including colonoscopy with concurrent biopsy. Results Most patients had relapsing remitting disease (85.7% in active disease and 83.3% in remission group). Active disease group had longer disease duration than remission group. Progression to microscopic colitislike histologic change seen in 17/53 (32.1%). Of which 88.2% associated with collagenous colitis and 11.8% with lymphocytic colitis. Five in active disease group had collagenous colitis-like change at baseline biopsy, 3/5 (60%) showed regression of thickness of collagen band on follow up biopsy. Conclusions Microscopic colitis-like histologic changes in ulcerative colitis are common. Ulcerative colitis subsequently evolving into collagenous colitis or lymphocytic colitis suggesting microscopic colitis could be a part of the spectrum of inflammatory bowel disease. Prognostic implication of this histological transformation to microscopic colitis in chronic ulcerative colitis patients is still unknown and has to be further evaluated in prospective studies. Until then it might be prudent to consider microscopic colitis as a part of the natural history of inflammatory bowel disease, at least in some cases. Background Phantom rectal syndrome (PRS) is a rare and a poorly understood area where patients with a background of abdominoperineal resection (APR)/similar dissection develop symptoms arising from the resected bowel. Symptoms are either painful or non-painful. This descriptive study attempts to explore the prevalence and the burden of these symptoms. Methods This descriptive study was conducted at Colombo North Teaching Hospital amongst patients who underwent APR. Interviewer based questionnaire was administered to a total of 30 surviving patients within past 5 years. Results Out of the 30 patients, 33% had sensation arising from the resected distal bowel. And out of those with symptoms, 80% of patients had painless symptoms and only 20% of patients had intermittent painful rectal symptoms. All patients who had such symptoms had undergone the surgery at an age less than 55 years Laparoscopic surgery had 35% risk of PRS compared to pure open procedure which is 30%. 80% patients are staged II B. Only 20% of patients with symptoms have seeked emergency medical attention and symptoms objectively halved with regular analgesics. Reassurance at clinic level was received by all patients and the perturbations to activities of daily living was minimal afterwards. Conclusion Phantom rectal syndrome is a common but poorly addressed complication of perineal surgery in APR. And the likelihood increases with younger age group, perirectal involvement. We feel a thorough explanation of the possibility of phantom rectal symptoms preoperatively and postoperatively is required and will improve symptoms.",

Intussusception is rare in adults. Colonic involvement represents up to 50% of cases. Due to the high rates of malignancy and recurrence in adult intussusception, it has traditionally been considered an indication for surgery. We report our single center experience in management of adult colonic intussusception by endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). Aims and Methods Patients with colonic intussusception managed by ESD were identified from prospectively kept ESD database over an 7 year period (2010-2017). All patients underwent pre-ESD colonoscopy with reduction of intussusception by hydrostatic reduction method and relevant imaging (EUS/CT) to assess respectability and layer of origin. ESD was performed using standard colonoscope/gastroscope with distal transparent hood, insulated tip (IT) and dual knives, CO2 insufflation. Submucosal cushion was created using a modified gelatin solution stained with methylene blue injected through a sclerotherapy needle. General anaesthesia was used. Results Seven patients underwent endoscopic reduction of intussusception followed by ESD. Mean age 63.6 years, males-5. All patients presented with recurrent abdominal colic and abdominal distension over a period of 2 months. Three (42.8%) of the lesions were in the ascending colon, 3 (42.8%) in sigmoid colon, 1 (14.4%) in transverse colon. Enbloc resection was achieved in 6 (85.7%) patients.

            "text": "Introduction Colon cancer is one of the most aggressive types of cancer worldwide. Tumor suppressor gene p53 mutation is implicated in many gastrointestinal malignancies including. The immunohistochemical protein expression of mutant p53 has been proposed as a potential tool to evaluate the biological behavior of colon cancer. Majority of studies suggest the poor prognostic significance of Mp53 expression in colon cancer, however, several studies show conflicting results. Hence this study was formulated to know the survival of patients with Mp53 expression. Methods It is a prospective analytical study for duration August 2014 to August 2016, consist of 64 consecutive patients of colon cancer diagnosed by colonoscopy and histopathology. These biopsy specimens were treated immuno-histochemically and expression of Mp53 gene is analyzed by immunoreactive score (IRS score). These findings compared with clinicopathological parameters like age, gender, location, appearance, histological grades TNM and clinical stages. All patients received treatment and kept under follow up for 1 yr to assess the survival. Results Study included 39 (60.94%) male and 25 (39.06%) female patients (M:F ratio 1.56:1). Mp53 expression analyzed by IRS score showed low expression (score \u22646) in 21 patients (32.81%) and high expression (>6) in 43 patients (67.19%). Level of Mp53 expression increased significantly with distal location, increasing histological grades of colon cancer and TNM stage (p=<0.001). Survival at 1 year in Mp53 high expression group is 63.86% (SE=.0471, CI=0.75-0.97) and in Mp53 low expression group is 90.43% (SE=0.06, CI=0.53-0.78) with statistically significant difference in these groups (p=0.0001). Conclusion Expression of Mp53 in colon cancer showed positive correlation with distal location, increasing histological grade, and TNM stages. High Mp53 expression group has significantly low survival than low Mp53 expression group, suggesting that immunohistochemical analysis of Mp53 is simple and effective modality to determine the prognosis and survival in colon cancer Background Colonic thickening is a commonly reported finding on diagnostic abdominal pelvic computed tomography (CT) in patients with history of lower gastrointestinal symptoms. The significance of this nonspecific finding is not clear. Aim To establish clinicopathological diagnosis in colonic thickening on CT, in tertiary care hospital of southern India. Methods All patients with colonic thickening on CT were prospectively evaluated with colonoscopy, biopsy and other relevant investigations. This is a prospective study done from November 2017 to June 2018. The primary objective was to identify pathological diagnosis in colonic thickening. Results A total of 90 patients met the inclusion criteria of our study. Of those, 85% had various identifiable pathologies on colonoscopy. Only 15% had normal colonoscopic findings. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and infectious colitis were the most common causes of colonic thickening. A report of \"skip lesions\" on the CT (5%) was always associated with IBD. \"Pancolitis\" reported on the CT (11%) was associated with endoscopic findings of IBD in 45% of cases, infection in 35% of cases, and normal findings in 20% of cases. The report of \"stranding\"(36%) on CT in the presence of colonic thickening was associated with many non-neoplastic endoscopic pathologic processes, including IBD (29%), infectious colitis (26%), and ischemia (15%), but also was associated with normal endoscopic findings in 26% of the cases. \"Lymphadenopathy\" was reported in 37% of the CTs and was associated with infectious colitis (30%), IBD (38%), or neoplastic processes (15%) but also normal endoscopic findings in 15%. Conclusion Symptomatic patients who are found to have nonspecific colonic thickening on CT should undergo definitive endoscopic investigation because the majority will have significant gastroenterological disease, and only a minority will have a normal colonoscopy. Background and Aims Microscopic colitis (MC) remains an underreported cause of chronic diarrhea. Histopatholgy is the established gold standard with variable yield. It is imperative to look for oro-cecal transit time (OCTT) and concomitant lactose intolerance in these cases to understand the complex symptoms. Hydrogen (H2) breath tests (H2BT) is frequently used for determining prevalence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), lactose tolerance, and oro-cecal transit time (OCTT) and was used for this study. Methods Forty-three patients of MC [mean age -45.83 (plusmn;15.92] and 10 controls were studied. Among these, 37 (86%) patients with microscopic colitis; 9 (90%) controls underwent breath tests. SIBO was diagnosed with glucose H2BT. For confirmation, rise;12 ppm over fasting value in H2 concentration within 2 hours of glucose ingestion was accepted. Lactulose H2BT was done to calculate OCTT. Time taken for rise in breath hydrogen by;12 ppm over baseline value in two consecutive readings was considered as OCTT. For lactose breath test, 15 minutes samples were taken up to 4 hours. A; 20 ppm rise over fasting value in H2 concentration in two consecutive readings was considered suggestive of intolerance. Results Four (9.5%) patients of SIBO in Glucose H2BT were enrolled in controls. Mean (+ SD) OCTT in cases of MC vs. controls was 130.38 plusmn; 47.95 mins and 97.14 plusmn; 48.55 mins (p= 0.109) respectively. Thus OCTT was prolonged in 73% cases of MC vs. 43% controls. Also, in the MC group, 9 (28.1%) patients were lactose intolerant while 3 (42.9%) controls were intolerant (p= 0.654). Although controls were more frequently lactose intolerant but a significant 28% MC patients were also intolerant possibly aggravating symptoms. Conclusion Lactose intolerance has lesser prevalence in cases of microscopic colitis. These patients were also detected to have paradoxically prolonged OCTT, excluding role of small bowel in its diarrheal symptoms.",

Out of the 216 IBD patients, 69% had UC; 30% had CD and 1% had indeterminate colitis. 43% of the respondents had to wait for more than six months for a final diagnosis. 90.74% had adequate access to a specialist gastroenterologist. 63.88% of the respondents were satisfied with the current IBD treatment. Awareness about availability of other health care workers (nurse trained in IBD, counsellor, psychologist) was poor. 61.57% of respondents felt that the attending specialist/gastroenterologist should have raised more fundamental questions during consultations. More than 70% of the respondents were at least sometimes worried about their next aggravation during periods of remission. 40.3% of respondents felt stressed or under pressure due to absence from work as a result of sickness related to IBD. 33.33% of the respondents felt that IBD negatively affected their professional development. One-thirds of the respondents felt that IBD stopped them from achieving intimate relationships, caused an interruption in maintaining intimate relationships and stopped them from entering into a new relationship. 51.4% of the respondents were worried about the availability of toilets. 94% of the respondents were not connected by any way to any of the support organizations for IBD. Conclusion IBD significantly affects the physical, personal, social and emotional quality of life. Our data highlights unmet needs of Indian patients suffering with IBD.",

            "text": "Introduction Ulcerative colitis (UC) represents a group of idiopathic disorders characterized by chronic or recurring inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Several factors contribute to a destruction of the intestinal epithelial barrier, increased gut permeability, and an influx of immune cells. Given that most cellular functions as well as maintenance of the epithelial barrier is energy-dependent, it is logical to assume that mitochondrial dysfunction may play a key role in both the onset and recurrence of disease. The aim of this study was to determine whether UQCRB can be used molecular marker for ulcerative colitis. Methods Blood and tissue samples were obtained from 50 UC patients and 50 healthy volunteers. Total RNA was extracted immediately and followed by cDNA construction from blood and tissue samples. The correlation between the expression of three genes (UQCRB, UQCRFS1 and MT-CYB) in the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III and clinicopathological features was determined. Results Compared to non-tumor tissues, UQCRB gene expression was upregulated in UC patients (p=0.01). Expression of these genes in blood samples was also shown significant difference in patient and controls (p=0.001). All the genes were positively correlated with disease severity (p=0.04). UQCRB overexpression was correlated with specific UC clinicopathological features, indicating clinical significance as a prognostic predictor in UC. Conclusion Our results provide novel insights into the critical role of UQCRB in regulating UC, supporting mitochondria complex III genes as a novel candidate marker for the development of prognostic tool UC patients . 122",

Earlier reports suggested that it occurred in 1.6% to 6 % of all patients with ulcerative colitis and in 9.5% to 20% of patients with acute severe UC. Most data on TMC has come from Europe and North America. Asian data on frequency and outcome of TMC is sparse. The aim of the current study was to determine the frequency and outcome of TMC in a developing country (India) which has a significant burden of UC. Methods All patients diagnosed to have TMC over a 4 year period between March 2015 and February 2018 at GB Pant hospital, New Delhi were prospectively enrolled in the study.",

            "text": "Results TMC was documented in 20 (11 females) of the 515 patients (3.8%) with UC during the study period. The mean age of the pts was 36.4 yrs; the mean duration of the UC at the time of admission was 28 months. All patients except one had pancolitis with a mean Clinical Mayo Score of 7.5. The mean values of Hb, TLC and serum albumin were 8.7, 12,830 and 1.92 respectively. Mean colonic diameter of the cohort was 7.3 cm. A fatal outcome occurred in 9 (45%) patients. Sub-total colectomy was performed in 11 patients with a fatal outcome in 6 (54%) patients. Two important predictors of mortality were colonic perforation and serum albumin levels. Age less than 40 yrs and first episode were not associated with a higher risk of death but this could be a Type II error due to the small sample size. Conclusion Surgery is the mainstay of management of UC. The high postoperative mortality rate in our study is attributed to the presence of colonic perforations. Background To study the prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in patients of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), prior to immunosuppressive therapy. Methods Forty-one IBD (UC=100%) patients with active disease planned for immunosuppressive therapy, were screened for LTBI using Quantiferon TB Gold (QFT-G). Results Seven (3 male/4 female) out of 41 (20 male/21 female) patients were positive for QFT-G (17.07%). All 7 had normal chest X-rays. 2/4 female and 1/3 male patients had history of treatment for tuberculosis. Conclusion Immunosuppressive therapy increases the risk of tuberculosis. QFT-G is unaffected by BCG vaccine and non-TB mycobacteria, making it a superior method for LTBI screening. IBD patients should be screened for LTBI, before starting immunosuppressive or Biological therapy to prevent activation of LTBI with poor outcome.",

Methods Patients with Crohn's disease who underwent colonoscopy for assessment of disease activity also underwent a USG within a 2-week period without change in treatment. Colonoscopic disease activity was assessed by the SES-CD, SES-CD score of 3 and higher was defined as endoscopically active. Clinical disease activity was assessed by the HBI, and a HBI of 5 or more was defined as active disease. USG parameters assessed include bowel wall thickness (BWT), loss of bowel wall stratification (BWS), Doppler activity. Doppler activity was evaluated semiquantitatively by the Limberg score. Results Thirty-five patients were enrolled in the study, 12 patients (34%) were in endoscopic remission, 7 patients (20%) had mild endoscopic activity, 6 patients (17%) had moderate endoscopic activity and 10 patients (29%) had severe endoscopic activity as per the SES-CD score. As per the HBI, eighteen (51%) patients were in remission, 6 (17%) had mild, 8 (23%) had moderate and 3 (9%) had severe disease. Sixteen (46%) patients had only small intestinal involvement, 13 (37%) ileocolonic and 6 (17%) colonic only. Median BWT was greater in patients with active disease when compared to those in endoscopic remission (6 mm vs. 2.45 mm, p<0.01). BWT correlated with SES CD (r=0.455, p 0.007) and HBI (r=0.506, p 0.002). BWS correlated with SES-CD (r=0.432, p 0.011) and HBI (r=0.483, p 0.003), Doppler correlated with SES-CD (r=0.494, p0.003) and HBI (r=0.656, p 0.001). Conclusion USG is a useful modality in assessing disease activity in Crohn's disease. Bowel wall thickness, loss of stratification and Doppler activity in the bowel wall correlate with endoscopic and clinical disease activity.",

Methods Patients who underwent colonoscopy for assessment of disease activity underwent USG within 2 weeks. Endoscopic activity was graded with the Mayo Endoscopic Score (MES); clinical disease activity was assessed using the Total Mayo Score (TMS). Colonic wall thickness (CWT), loss of bowel wall stratification (WS), Doppler activity (DA) were assessed. DA was evaluated semi-quantitatively by the Limberg score. Results Seventeen patients were included in the study, 10/17 (59%) had left-sided colitis, 41% (7/17) had pancolitis. MES of 0, 1, 2, 3 was seen in 1, 3, 8 and 5 patients respectively. As per TMS, 8 (47%) patients had severe disease, 8 (47%) had mild to moderate disease and one patient (6%) was in remission. USG accurately assessed the disease extent in 16 (94%) patients. Median CWT was lower in patients with MES 0-1 when compared to MES 2-3 (3mm vs. 4.1 mm, p 0.01). CWT correlated with MES (r=0.763, p 0.000) and with TMS (r=0.748, p 0.001). DA correlated with MES (r = 0.806, p 0.001) and TMS (r = 0.789, p0.0001). Loss of bowel wall stratification correlated with MES (r=0.551, p 0.022) and TMS (r=0.505, p 0.039). In patients in whom the bowel wall stratification was preserved, the MES was 1 point lower than in whom it was lost. Conclusion USG is accurate in assessing disease extent and disease activity in UC and correlates with the Mayo score. CWT and DA and wall doppler activity are accurate in predicting MES of 2 or 3.",

Methods Patients who underwent colonoscopy for assessment of disease activity also underwent USG within 2 weeks. Endoscopic activity was graded with MES; clinical disease activity was assessed using the Total Mayo score (TMS). All assessments were performed for the rectum, sigmoid, descending, transverse, and ascending colon and caecum. A novel score based on colonic wall thickness (CWT), loss of bowel wall stratification, Doppler activity (D) was calculated for each segment and correlated to the MES. Results A total of 102 colonic segments were analyzed. Median CWT was lower in patients with MES 0-1 when compared to MES 2-3 (3 mm vs. 4.1 mm, p 0.01). The ultrasound score (USS), Table 1 , was calculated for each colonic segment and correlated to the MES for that particular segment. USS correlation to MES for each segment was as follows: caecum (r= 0.95, p 0.0001); ascending colon (r =0.9, p 0.001), transverse colon (r = 0.955, p 0.0001), descending colon (r =0.845, p 0.001), sigmoid colon (r=0.816, p= 0.0001), rectum (r=0.761, p 0.001). The USS for sigmoid colon correlated with the overall MES (r= 1, p 0.0001), and Total Mayo score (r = 0.918, p 0.0001).

Data about demography, disease extent, duration and treatment were collected. NAFLD was defined as fatty liver on ultrasonography and absence of alcohol intake. 2D Shear Wave (2D-SWE) Elastography was done in patients with fatty liver using Toshiba Aplio 500 Ultrasound Machine. Advanced liver fibrosis was diagnosed by 3 F2 Fibrosis (Mean stiffness >7 Kpa) on Elastography. All the patients were screened for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, metabolic syndrome using ATP III criteria. Results Fifty patients with mean age (35.7\u00b112 years) of IBD (UC=46, CD=4) with mean duration of disease (4.4\u00b19 years) were included in the study. Mean BMI was 18.6 kg/m 2 . Only one patient had diabetes mellitus. No patient fulfilled criteria of metabolic syndrome. On ultrasound, 10 cases (25%) had hepatomegaly and 5 cases (12.5%) had fatty liver. On 2D-SWE elastography of these 5 patients, mean elasticity was (18.65\u00b110 Kpa) with all patients showing significant fibrosis (F2=2, F3=2, F4=1, patients respectively). Conclusion NAFLD is a frequent comorbidity in patients with IBD. These patients can also develop advanced liver fibrosis. Every effort should be made to achieve remission, as higher disease activity and duration is linked to development of NAFLD and advanced fibrosis, despite the absence of conventional risk factors.

This study was planned to evaluate the clinical profile of 5 immunocompetent apparently healthy patients with CMV colitis in a single tertiary referral center. Methods Retrospective data analysis of 5 immunocompetent patients diagnosed with CMV colitis based on clinical, colonoscopic and histological features between August 2017 to July 2018 in GIPMER, New Delhi. Results Five patients who are non-IBD and tested negative for HIV are diagnosed to have CMV colitis on the basis of histopathology reports (both IHC and cytopathy on HE stain). Out of 5 cases 4 are female. The median age of presentation was 58 yrs (range: 45-64 yrs). Duration of symptoms range from 3 weeks to 8 weeks with a median of 4 weeks. All 5 patients had pain abdomen, 4 had bloody diarrhea, 1 presented with non-bloody diarrhea, 1 patient had fever at presentation. Only 1 patient was anemic and 1 patient was febrile at presentation. TLC was raised in only one patient. Two patients had underlying diabetes that were well controlled (HbA1C <6.5). CECT abdomen shows involvement of right colon (ascending colon and cecum) in 4 patients and involvement of left colon (anal canal and rectum) in 1 patient. Colonoscopy revealed ulcerations in colon in all patients. Two patients had deep, large, discrete, transverse ulcers in transverse colon, ascending colon and cecum; 2 had superficial ulcers in rectum and sigmoid colon; 1 had pan-colonic ulcerations.

Histopathology is gold standard for diagnosis but colonic biopsy has a variable yield in view of normal endoscopy. This study evaluated ileocolonic mucosa in suspected MC cases with narrow band imaging (NBI), described its findings and outcome of targeted biopsy. Methods Fifty-three adults with suspected MC were recruited after excluding malignancy, celiac disease, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and inflammatory bowel disease. Routine blood tests, necessary imaging, stool analysis were done. All underwent colonoscopy with ileal intubation if possible. HDWLE (high definition white light examination) and NBI finding were recorded. Routine biopsies on white light and targeted biopsies on NBI were taken and analysed by an expert gastrointestinal histopathologist as per statements of the European Microscopic Colitis Group 2012. Results Forty-three patients were confirmed to have MC (mean age-45.83 [\u00b115.92], males-27). The WLE revealed normal mucosa in all patients. NBI showed type 1 pit pattern and regular vascular pattern in all patients with MC. Mucosal pattern was honey comb type in all. Focal areas of abnormal vascularity with focally obscure pit pattern was noted more frequently in cases than controls (81% vs. 12.5% [p=0.052]). Histologically 25 (58.1%) had collagenous colitis (CC), 14 (32.5%) had lymphocytic colitis (LC) and 4 (9.4%) had mixed picture. The yield of WLE and NBI targeted biopsies were not different (p>0.05). Conclusion Colonoscopic NBI findings in MC revealed a hitherto unreported and distinct focal areas of abnormal vascularity with focally obscure pit pattern. Also, there was no significant difference in yield of NBI vs. WLE biopsies.",

These lower GI strictures cause significant morbidity in the general population. Endoscopic treatment has emerged as an effective alternative to surgery in the management of lower GI strictures. Aim Study of etiology, clinical profile and management of left colonic and anorectal strictures. Methods Thirty patients between the age group of 30 to 70 years were included in the study. A retrospective case note review was carried out from June 2015 to July 2018. All confirmed cases of left colonic and anorectal stricture by barium enema, CECT abdomen and colonoscopy were included in the study. Data collected included patient demographics, clinical symptoms and management. Results Out of 30 patients,16 (53%) were males and 14 (47%) were females. Majority of the patients were in the age group of 50 to 70 yrs (80%) in both groups. Twenty-four (80%) patients had anorectal stricture and 6 (20%) had left colonic stricture. The most common etiology identified was postsurgical anastomotic strictures (53%) followed by post radiation induced stricture (26%), Crohn's disease (13%) and post hemorrhoid surgery (6%). In patients with anorectal stricture, most common symptom was strenuous painful bowel movements (80%) and with left colonic stricture most commom symptom was abdominal pain. Out of 30, 24 (80%) patients underwent balloon dilatation. Among 24 patients,12 (50%) patients had 1 dilataion, 8 (33%) patients had 2 dilatations, 3 (12%) patients had 3 dilatation and 1 patient had 4 dilatations. Two patients underwent surgery due to post dilatation complications. Conclusion Study shows that left colonic and anorectal stricture was more common in the older age group and most common etiology was postsurgical anastomotic stricture. Endoscopic balloon dilatation is an effective management of treating lower GI stricture.",

Immunomodulatory effects of vitamin-D has been linked to autoimmune disease such as ulcerative colitis and deficiency of vitamin-D has been found to correlate with severity and activity of disease. In our study we evaluated the prevalence of vitamin-D deficiency in mild, moderate, and severe ulcerative colitis. Aim To study the prevalence of vitamin-D level and deficiency in ulcerative colitis patient at our centre. Methods Retrospective data of 70 patients with ulcerative colitis diagnosed by clinical, endoscopic and histopathologic evaluation from 2015-2017 at our centre were included in the study and they are classified into mild, moderate, severe by Truelove and Witts criteria. Serum vitamin-D levels were measured in all patients and 70 healthy controls. Patients with mean age of 22-55 years and no comorbid illness such as diabetes mellitus, systemic hypertension, chronic kidney disease were included in the study. Vitamin-D levels were defined as sufficient (>30 ng/mL), insufficient (20-30 ng/mL), deficient (<20 ng/mL1). Results Seventy patients (male=43, female=27) with mean age of 40 years and average symptom duration of 6 months prior to our hospital visit were reassessed during follow up at our hospital. They were classified into mild UC group n=23 (32.8%), moderate UC group n=31 (44.28%) and severe UC group n=16 (22.85%). Among study group 18 (78.26%) patients in mild UC, 26 (83.87%) patients in moderate UC and 14 (87.5%) patients in severe UC group were vitamin-D deficient. Among 70 healthy controls serum vitamin-D levels were deficient in 18 (25.71%) patients and insufficient in 22 (31.42%) patients. Conclusions We conclude that immunomodulatory property of serum vitamin-D might be a contributory factor to disease activity of ulcerative colitis, however other factors such as infections, poor compliance to treatment and steroid resistance should also be considered.",

Likewise differentiating ulcerative colitis from Crohn's disease with colonic or ileocolonic involvement is difficult. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical, endoscopic, radiologic and histological features that will help to differentiate Crohn's disease from intestinal luminal tuberculosis as well as from ulcerative colitis. Methods A total of 52 patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease, intestinal luminal TB and ulcerative colitis who were admitted under the Gastroenterology Department from July 2017 to July 2018 were included in this retrospective study. Clinical, endoscopic, radiologic, histopathologic and microbiologic features as well as response to treatment of these patients were studied in detail. Results Among 52 patients, intestinal TB was diagnosed in 44.2% patients, ulcerative colitis in 40.4% patients and Crohn's disease in 15.4% patients. There was a higher incidence of fever, night sweats, lung involvement and ascites in intestinal TB whereas diarrhea, perianal disease, hematochezia and extraintestinal were predictive for Crohn's disease. Similarly, on colonoscopy involvement of IC valve, patulous IC valve and transverse ulcers favored, a diagnosis of intestinal TB in contrast to Crohn's disease where longitudinal ulcers, aphthous ulcers, cobblestone appearance and rectal involvement were seen. Similarly, the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis was favored by rectal involvement and contiguous involvement whereas patients with Crohn's colitis had significantly more deep ulcers, cobblestoning, skip areas and ileal involvement. Conclusion Crohn's disease must be differentiated from intestinal luminal TB and ulcerative colitis before treatment. According to our study, a combination of clinical, endoscopic, serologic, radiologic, histopathologic and microbiologic features can be utilized in order to reliably predict and distinguish Crohn's disease from intestinal luminal TB and from ulcerative colitis. In complicated cases deep enteroscopy and surgery may be needed before a confident diagnosis is reached.",

The immune system is a major effector of this tissue damage caused by the action of multiple cell types and soluble mediators. Some of these soluble mediators such as TNF\u03b1, IL-17 and IL-22 are immunotherapeutic targets in IBD. Interleukin 15 (IL-15) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that belongs to the IL-2 family of cytokines. IL-15R is heterotrimeric and is formed of the ligand binding IL-15R\u03b1, the \u03b2 chain shared with IL-2 and the common \u03b3 chain (\u03b3c). IL-15 is involved in the maintenance and activation of different subgroups of cytotoxic lymphocytes and macrophages in the intestinal epithelium. Expression of IL-15 is increased in IBD in humans and in murine models of intestinal inflammation. We hypothesize that IL-15 contributes to the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation. Objectives 1) Identify the signals that induce the expression of IL-15 in human intestinal epithelial cells. 2) Determine the therapeutic efficacy of the anti-IL-15Rb antibody in DSS induced colitis. Methods Gene expression for pro-inflammatory cytokine production by human primary epithelial cells in response to TLR-ligands and inflammatory cytokines were analyzed. The effect of neutralizing IL-15 signaling on the development of colitis following administration of DSS was analyzed.",

The annual incidence of LGI bleeding is approximately 20 cases/100,000 population. It is associated with significant rebleeding and mortality. Hence the study was conducted to determine the frequency of different causes of rectal bleeding in patients at Department of Digestive health and diseases, Chennai. Methods This is a 1 year cross sectional study, data is collected from colonoscopy registry of MGE Department from August 2017 to July 2018. Total no of cases who admitted with lower GI bleed were 241. Out of which, growth was noted in 71 cases, hemorrhoids in 64 cases, 25 patients had IBD, and 15 patients had polyps. Descriptive statistics were used to calculate mean\u00b1SD of numerical data, e.g. age. Nominal data like gender and colonoscopic findings were analyzed by their frequencies and percentages. Results A total of 241 patients (134 males and 107 females) with mean age 38.6 +/-9.2 years were part of the study. Colonoscopy showed abnormal findings in 232 (96.2%). The commonest diagnosis was growth, which was found in 71 (29.4%) patients (rectosigmoid 50 (70.4%). It was followed by hemorrhoids in 64 (26.5%) patients, 25 (10.3%) patients had IBD, and 15 (6.2%) patients had polyps. Other less frequent findings were non-specific inflammation, radiation proctitis, SRUS and diverticula. Conclusion Growth was the leading cause of bleeding per rectum in this study, followed by hemorrhoids and IBD, which is in contrast to western literature while infrequent findings of SRUS and diverticula indicate that these are uncommon in our centre. Hence in any case presenting with bleeding PR, an high index of suspicion for malignancy should be kept and colonoscopy +biopsy should be performed.",

The fecal microbial transplant (FMT) is the process of transferring microbial communities from a healthy donor to a recipient; consequently, it is now widely investigated for its ability to improve various health issues that are associated with gastrointestinal diseases. In this study, we investigated changes in gut microbiota following FMT in a patient with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We describe changes in the composition of the fecal microbiome from a patient recipient before and after he underwent fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for IBS condition. There was the marked loss of bacterial diversity with reduced bacterial phylum belonging to Firmicutes before FMT; this was corrected after post-FMT, furthermore notably 13 more donor bacterial species were engrafted after the post-FMT which belongs to the phylum, actinobacteria, bacteroidetes and firmicutes. The dynamic changes in the bacterial microbiome after post-FMT in the form of restoration of the microbiome highlights changes in community dynamics reflecting changes in the host gut environment. Background Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with increased risk of thromboembolic (TE) complications. However, the information on exact burden of TE in IBD and its predictors are lacking, especially from developing countries, where IBD is on the rise. The present study aimed to find out the prevalence and predictors of TE in patients with IBD and their prognosis. Methods This case control study included 32 patients with IBD (ulcerative colitis [UC, n=23]; Crohn's disease [CD] n=8, IBD unclassified n=1) with history of TE, selected out from a cohort of 3597 patients with IBD (UC n=2752, CD n=845) under follow up from 2004-2018. Details on demographics, extra intestinal manifestations (EIMs), patient's status at the time of TE, type and outcome of TE including recurrence, treatment details before and after TE, and disease course before and after TE were collected and compared with IBD patients without history of TE in the ratio of 1:4. Results The prevalence of TE in patients of IBD was 0.9% (UC-0.8%, CD-0.95%). Among patients with TE (mean age, 39.5+14.7 years, 47% males), median duration from disease onset to TE was 19 (IQR-5-45) months, 37% had other EIMs, 75% had severe disease at time of TE, 70% had steroid dependent or steroid refractory disease, and 2 patients (6%) died because of disease related complications. Lower limb was the commonest site for TE (72%), 16% had pulmonary TE, and 19% had involvement of multiple sites. More patients with UC and TE had pancolitis (80% vs. 40%, p<0.001), higher prevalence of other EIMs (45% vs. 27%, p=0.15), severe disease(75% vs. 10%, p<0.001), steroid dependent/refractory disease (68% vs. 15%, p<0.001), aggressive disease course (38% vs. 12%, p=0.004), H/O surgery (19% vs. 5%, p=0.027), and H/O acute severe colitis (43% vs. 9%, p<0.001). Conclusion Approximately 1% patients with IBD develop thromboembolism relatively early during their disease course, and TE is a marker of severe disease and higher disease related complication. Background Although inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is common in India and disease burden continues to grow, little is known regarding physician's awareness about IBD. Methods We identified and electronically surveyed a random sample of 100,000 practicing physicians throughout India over a four month period (March 2018-June 2018). Physicians were questioned (sixteen questions) electronically on various aspects related to their daily encounter of patients with IBD and their responses were analyzed. Results A total of 332 physicians (median age 47.5 years, 82.2% males) responded. Most physicians (93.7%) had been in practice for 3 or more years in urban area (72.9%) and were into hospital based (41.6%) or individual (37%) practice. About 60% physicians evaluated \u22641 patient/ month with IBD, 32% evaluated >1/month, while 7% saw >1/patient per week. Most of their patients were from middle (48.5%) or lower (38.6%) socioeconomic status, and maximum had urban background (48.2%). More than two-thirds felt that IBD is common in India,~60% felt that UC is the commonest subtype, and 25% believed that disease burden of IBD in India is one of the highest in World. 85% believed that it's difficult to differentiate between CD and ITB. Almost all were aware (98.5%) that IBD needs long-term treatment and that UC can progress to colorectal cancer (92.2%).",

However, pathogenesis of these symptoms in T2DM remains to be poorly understood. Thus, aim of the study was to evaluate association of adrenergic receptor beta 2 (ADRB2) gene polymorphism on GI motility leading to diarrhea and constipation. Methods Three hundred T2DM patients attending Diabetic Clinic at PGIMER, Chandigarh and 200 age and sex matched healthy controls were enrolled. Non-invasive lactulose hydrogen breath test was used for measurement of gut motility i.e. oro-cecal transit time (OCTT). 5 mL blood was taken from subjects. Buffy coat was used for isolation of DNA. ADRB2 gene polymorphism was performed by PCR followed by restriction enzyme digestion. Results GI symptoms in T2DM patients were constipation (55.4%) and diarrhea (14.3%). It was observed that significantly (p<0.01) more number of T2DM patients with diarrhea had GG genotype (28.7%). OCTT (72.4\u00b12.6 minutes) was significantly rapid in T2DM patients with diarrhea who had GG genotype as compared to AG (82.7\u00b13.5 minutes) or AA (99.3\u00b14.8 minutes) genotype.

Also, OCTT though showed delaying trend in AA genotype (159.8\u00b15.1 minutes) as compared to AG (154.2\u00b14.7 minutes) or GG (147.2\u00b13.3 minutes) genotype but data was not significant. Conclusion It can be concluded that patients with GG genotype had fast motility and more number of patients with diarrhea had GG genotype. Thus, patients with GG genotype are more prone of developing diarrhea through effect of rapid gut motility.",

            "text": "Introduction A large population of India is at risk of developing post infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) due to the high incidence of acute gastroenteritis. A risk score developed by Thabane et al. can be useful to predict patients at higher risk of developing PI-IBS. The aim of this study was to validate the PI-IBS risk score in an Indian population. Method Patients of acute infectious diarrhea admitted to a tertiary care hospital of Odisha from September 2014 to October 2016 were assessed about various risk factors associated with PI-IBS. Follow up surveys with IBS Questionnaire were done after 6 months and PI-IBS was diagnosed according to ROME III criteria. Comparison of the baseline characteristics and PI-IBS score was done between patients who developed PI-IBS after 6 months and who didn't develop. Area under the receiver operating curve was used to determine the discriminatory ability of the PI-IBS risk score. Results Out of 136 patients of acute gastroenteritis included in the study, 35 patients (25.7%) developed PI-IBS at 6 months. Females and younger patients more often developed PI-IBS at 6 months (57.1% vs. 38.6%; p value=0.04 and 30.37\u00b111.67 vs. 47.12\u00b117.06; p value<0.001) respectively. The risk score was significantly higher in patients who developed PI-IBS (72.4\u00b114.48 vs. 31.56\u00b120.4; p value <0.001). The area under the ROC curve was 0.92 for our study population (95% CI -0.878 to 0.977). A score of more than equal to 50 had a sensitivity of 91.4% and specificity of 84.2% to predict PI-IBS at 6 months. Conclusions A PI-IBS risk score of 50 or more is a highly sensitive predictor for PI-IBS development following acute gastroenteritis. It is easy to use and cost effective to identify patients at higher risk of developing PI-IBS so that early counselling and intervention can be instituted.",

Ambulatory 24 hours pH monitoring is often recommended in patients experiencing symptoms of GERD despite on PPI therapy. Recent studies show that pH studies are predictably normal in this setting. The objective of the study was to describe 24 hours pH findings in patients having persistent symptoms despite PPI therapy. Methods A prospective analysis was done in IMS and SUM Hospital; a tertiary care hospital at Bhubaneswar for a duration of 6 months from October 2017-March 2018. Those patients who are clinically suspected of having GERD despite being on single dose of PPI therapy for at least 4 weeks were included in the study. pH data was analyzed for 24 hours and were done for total; supine and upright periods. Abnormal reflux parameters were defined by applying three criteria: DeMeester score greater than 14.72; pH less than 4.0 more than 5.5% of the total time, more than 6.3% of the time upright, or more than 3% for the time supine position and pH less than 4 for more than 1.6% of the total time. Results A total of 32 patients were included in the study. All these patients were referred by gastroenterologists for evaluation of GERD. Twentyfour patients were males while 8 were female patients. The mean age of the patients was 34. De Meester score was greater than 14.72 in eighteen (57%) patients. If the second or third criteria were applied; it was abnormal in twenty-two (69%) patients. Conclusion In a patient population assessed by a specialist as clinically suspected GERD that is not responding to PPI therapy; a substantial number of patients will have abnormal esophageal pH results. Thus, pH testing is important in the evaluation of refractory GERD. Background and Aims Dyssynergic defecation is often under recognized in constipation patients which is often amenable to biofeedback therapy. The purpose of the study was to determine the anorectal manometric profile in patients of chronic constipation and to find whether there is any difference in the manometric findings in the patients of IBS-C and FC. Methods Twenty patients each of functional constipation and IBS-C (total of 40) were included in the study during a 12 month period for prospective observational comparative study and each patient underwent anorectal manometry and pressure recordings like basal pressure, squeeze pressure, RAIR, balloon expulsion test were recorded. Quantitative variables were compared using independent t test/Mann-Whitney Test (when the data sets were not normally distributed) between the two groups whereas Qualitative variables were correlated using Chi-square test/Fisher's Exact test. Results Significant number of dyssynergia was seen in both the groups; FC-45%, IBS-C-35%; with no statistically significant difference between the groups (p value-0.519). Basal pressure ( Background and Aim Impaired gastric accommodation is a major pathophysiological mechanism in functional dyspepsia [FD] . Nutrient drink test [NDT] is a non-invasive test which can be used to assess gastric accommodation. We compared the findings of NDT and single photon emission tomography [SPECT] in healthy volunteers and patients with FD. Methods Twenty-seven patients (13 men) with PDS diagnosed using Rome IV criteria, and 20 healthy volunteers (14 men) underwent NDT using Ensure (0.94 kcal/mL) at a rate of 30 mL/min. The maximum tolerated volume (MTV) was recorded. After the drink, symptoms were rated using visual analogue scales every thirty minutes for 2 hours. SPECT was done before and immediately after NDT to assess gastric volume and change in volumes were recorded. Results All patients (100%) had postprandial fullness and bloating at baseline. Eighty-five percent had burping, 77.8% had epigastric pain and 74% had nausea. Early satiety was present in 66.7%. The MTV (mean\u00b1SEM) for NDT (637.77\u00b145.9 ml vs. 660 \u00b1 51.18, p = 0.75), fasting SPECT volume (166.48\u00b114.7 vs. 161.3\u00b113.14 ml, p=0.8) and post-NDT SPECT volume (650.51\u00b133.76 vs. 685.85\u00b134.78, p=0.47) were similar in patients and controls. The MTV correlated with post NDT gastric volumes on SPECT (r=0.57, p=0.00029). Early satiety at baseline negatively correlated with MTV (p=0.009), and post NDT gastric volumes on SPECT (r = -0.46, p=0.04). Other symptoms of FD did not correlate with MTV or SPECT. Conclusion NDT is simple and inexpensive and can be used to assess gastric accommodation instead of SPECT. Symptoms of FD do not correlate with MTVof nutrient drink. Patients with severe early satiety drink less nutrient drink as compared to those with mild or no symptoms.",

PEG 3350 is an established first-line osmotic laxative, widely available for the treatment of all forms of constipation in adults and children. PEG 3350 acts by increasing stool volume through increased hydration, triggering colon motility to improve transit of softened stools and defecation mechanics. PEG 3350 is more efficacious, but with comparable tolerability to laxatives such as lactulose and ispaghula husk. Unlike PEG 3350, prucalopride is a selective serotonin (5-HT 4) receptor agonist. Though majority studies over prucalopride role in chronic constipation were done in females, there are few randomized control studies including both genders shown equal efficacy in males.

Conclusion PEG 3350+E was at least as effective as and generally better tolerated than prucalopride as a treatment for chronic constipation in this study population. Background Per oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is an emerging treatment modality for achalasia cardia (AC). Although efficacy of POEM in adult AC is well established, its role in pediatric AC is less clear. Technical parameters for POEM differ in pediatric patients as compared to adults. There is limited data about POEM for pediatric AC. This single center study reports outcomes of POEM for pediatric AC. Methods AC patients (<18 years) undergoing POEM identified from a prospectively maintained database. Pre-POEM evaluation -EGD, barium swallow and high-resolution manometry (HRM) in all. Pre-POEM Eckardt score calculated in all. All patients received posterior POEM. Follow up -EGD and Eckardt scores at 6-weeks, 6 and 12-months. Clinical success defined as post-POEM Eckardt score <3. Results N=15, median age=15 years (3-18), males=10. Mean duration of symptoms=21.9 months (6-54). Previous endoscopic balloon dilatation (EBD) in 3 (20%). Median pre-POEM BMI=14.9 kg/m2. All patients had Type II AC. Mean pre POEM Eckardt score=7.0\u00b11.7 and IRP=41.82 \u00b114.2 mm Hg respectively. Median length of myotomy=8 cm (6-11). Mean procedure time = 85.3\u00b131min.

Conclusion CRE dilatation of post op anastomotic stricture is a safe and effective modality of therapy in children of anastomotic stricture in Post TEF surgery. Objective Cycling vomiting syndrome (CVS) is an important cause of recurrent vomiting in children. We aimed to analyze the clinical profile and outcome of prophylactic therapy in children with CVS. Methods Children diagnosed as CVS by the Rome III criteria were analyzed for their clinical presentation and outcome . Prophylactic therapy was cyproheptadine\u00b1propranolol \u22645 years age and amitriptyline \u00b1propranolol >5 years age. Combination therapy was considered in those with non-response to monotherapy. Adjuvant therapy (valproate, carnitine, co-enzyme Q) was added in refractory cases. Results Of 737 referrals for recurrent vomiting, 34 (4.6%) were CVS. Age of symptom-onset was 76 (6-208) months. Number of episodes before starting prophylaxis, duration of each episode and symptom-free intervals were 5.7 (3-20), 2.5 (1-6.5) days and 3.27 (0.3-12) months respectively. Aura was associated in 50% (abdominal pain, 41%). Family history of migraine was noticed in 8/34 (23%) of children (17% mothers). All children were started on prophylaxis. Amitriptyline prophylaxis was started in 72%. Twenty-one percent of children required combination therapy and 5% required adjuvant therapy. Of the 28 children who are on regular follow up (median-24 months (2-72), 19 (67%) children reported at least one break through symptom. Duration between breakthrough episodes after prophylaxis was 10.9 (0.3-48) months. Sixty-three percent and 50% children at 2 years and 5 years respectively were symptom free. Conclusion Overall outcome of CVS is favorable. Amitriptyline prophylaxis is effective in majority with prolonged gap between break through episodes. Combination and adjuvant therapies are required in a small proportion. Methods Children with pancreatic trauma in last 8 years were analyzed for presentation, management and outcome.

Results Thirty-six children (age 144[13-194] months) presented after 30 (3-210) days of abdominal trauma due to bicycle handle (18), blunt object (9), fall from height (5) and motor vehicle accident (4). Fifteen cases each had Grade 3 and 4 injury, 4 had grade 5 and grading was not available in 2 cases. Four had injury to other organs (liver [3], kidney [2] ). Most children presented with abdominal pain (n-26) followed by ascites (n-12). Examination revealed palpable lump in 15, ascites in 12, pleural effusion in 9, epigastric tenderness in 5 and anasarca in 3 cases. Antibiotics, nasojejunal feeds, total parenteral nutrition and octreotide were given in 21, 17, 5 and 13 cases respectively. Drainage of ascites was done in 13 (surgical -1, percutaneous -12) and collection in 22 (percutaneous -18, endoscopic -3, surgical -1). ERP was successfully done in 11/12 cases (stenting [4], sphincterotomy [6], nasopancreatic drain [1] ). Cumulative hospital stay was 21.5 (3 to 91) days. Two children died (sepsis, multiorgan failure), 2 were lost and 32 were in follow up (11.5 [1 to 96] months). 14/32 developed chronic pancreatitis (CP) (11 parenchymal atrophy, 11 main pancreatic duct dilatation, 7 strictures, 1 calcification, 3 exocrine insufficiency and 2 prediabetes) of which 7 were symptomatic with pain. Longer interval between injury and presentation (73.6 vs. 36.5 days, p=0.03) predicted development of CP. Conclusion Multidisciplinary team approach is essential for managing pancreatic trauma. Majority (95%) improve, but 40% develop CP of which only half are symptomatic with pain. Delay in therapy posttrauma increases risk of developing CP.",

Methods Children diagnosed with GI lymphoma as per Dawson's criteria (predominant bowel lesion\u00b1involvement of corresponding draining lymph node without hematopoietic or reticuloendothelial system involvement) in last 17 years were analyzed. Treatment included chemotherapy \u00b1surgical debulking of tumor. Results Eighteen children (15 boys) were diagnosed with primary GI lymphoma. The median ages at presentation and duration of symptoms were 168 (36-228) and 3 (1-24) months respectively. Presenting features were pain abdomen in 14 (78%), lump in 8 (45%), vomiting in 9 (50%), bleeding per rectum in 4 (22%), jaundice in 3 (17%) and altered bowel habits in 6 (33%) cases. Eighty-three percent (n-15) cases had B symptoms. Six (33%) presented with subacute intestinal obstruction, of which 4 had intussusception. On imaging, tumor location was in duodenum in 4 (22%), jejunum in 2 (11%), ileum in 2 (11%), Ileaocecal region in 4 (22%), and colon in 6 (33%) cases. Colonoscopy and gastroduodenoscopy were done in 5 cases each and showed ulceroproliferative (n-5) and nodular masses (n-5). Yield of endoscopic biopsy was 90% (9/10) and percutaneous biopsy was 80% (4/5). Diagnosis was established from surgical specimen in 5 cases (resection-4 and biopsy-1). Histopathology showed Burkitt's lymphoma in 14 (78%), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBL) in 3(17%) and anaplastic large B cell lymphoma in 1 (5%). Surgery was done as primary therapy for obstruction in 5 (28%) cases and for post chemotherapy stricture in 2 (11%) cases. 13/18 (72%) were followed up for 22 (3-108) months; 9 completed chemotherapy (7-asymptomatic, 2 relapsed), 2 are on chemotherapy and 2 died (febrile neutropenia). Conclusion In children, GI lymphoma involves colon commonly followed by ileocecum and duodenum with predominant Burkitt's histology. Upfront surgery was required in 1/3rd for obstructive symptoms and 2/3rd have good outcome.",

Tufting enteropathy (TE) and microvillus inclusion disease (MID) form a group associated with defects in enterocytes. We report two cases who presented with intractable diarrhea and who surprisingly had histopathology findings of both tufting enteropathy and microvillus inclusion disease. First case is a 6 month old baby, born at term, with birth weight of 3 kg, presented with loose stools starting in the first week of life. On examination he had failure to thrive, generalized anasarca with mild ascites and pallor. Laboratory tests showed elevated TLC with thrombocytopenia and hypoalbuminemia. Multiple stool tests revealed presence of 40-50 pus cells as well as occult blood. HIV serology, primary immunodeficiency work up, thyroid function was normal. On gastroscopy there was mild scalloping in the duodenum and colonoscopy showed scattered areas of erythema and ulceration, with intervening areas normal. The second case, a 25 day old male baby presented to us with large volume watery diarrhea starting at day 10 of life. There was consanguinity in the parents and a previous male sibling had died at 14 months of age due to chronic diarrhea and malnutrition. Multiple stool examinations, thyroid function, HIV serology and primary immunodeficiency work up were normal. A gastroscopy and sigmoidoscopy were macroscopically normal. Both cases required prolonged parenteral nutrition, while the former is alive on elemental formula feeds the latter succumbed to severe sepsis. The histopathology in both cases showed presence of tufts along the mucosal surface, as well as multiple intraepithelial vesicles with microvilli with disarray of surface microvilli along with multiple desmosomes and CD 10 positivity, suggesting a diagnosis of both microvillous inclusion disease as well as tufting enteropathy. Introduction and Aims Small bowel bacterial overgrowth syndrome (SBOS) is an underdiagnosed cause of small bowel diarrhea in children. Gold standard jejunal aspirate cultures (JAC) have been used in limited studies. We prospectively assessed a) prevalence of pediatric SBOS, b) specific microbiological profile in JAC and correlation with hydrogen breath tests (HBT), c) response to antibiotics and outcome after stopping the therapy. Methodology Children with chronic diarrhea >3 months duration of undetermined etiology or without anatomical obstruction were recruited. They serially underwent glucose (day 1) and lactulose (day 2) HBT and JAC by a special jejunoscopy apparatus (day 3). Positive JAC patients received two phases (primary: day 1-14; secondary: day 28-42) of sensitive oral antibiotics with a wash out phase (day 14-28). SBOS was defined as: a) JAC count of \u2265100,000 CFU/mL, b) positive HBT (glucose and/or lactulose) and c) response (clinical and breath test) within 2 weeks of completion of second antibiotic therapy. Fulfilment of all three and first two criteria was labelled as confirmed SBOS and possible SBOS respectively. Cases were followed up for 6 months. Results Confirmed (31%, n=16) and possible (8%, n=4) SBOS was diagnosed in 52 symptomatic children (Table 1 ). In SBOS group, JAC yielded Pseudomonas (n=10), Escherichia coli (n=9) and Klebsiella (n=6), Streptococcus (n=5) and Acinetobacter (n=4). Against JAC, sensitivity/ specificity of glucose (74/96%) and lactulose HBT (46/73%) was seen. Confirmed SBOS showed multibacterial JAC (65%), dual breath test positivity (35%), clinical response to primary (67%) and secondary (100%) antibiotic therapies. Co-trimoxazole was used in primary and secondary antibiotic failure (n=4 possible SBOS; Klebsiella). Symptomatic recurrence (31% confirmed SBOS) was seen in 3 (2-6) mo follow up and responded (clinical and breath test) to primary antibiotic sensitivity.",

USG Doppler, SSM and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) were performed by experienc ed radi ologist a nd compared wi th h ealthy controls . Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was taken as reference standard, and compared with SSM and LSM values. Results Of 70 cases of PHTN screened, 51 were included in the study with 93% success rate for acquisition of SSM. Of the 51, 49% cases were prehepatic, 41% were hepatic and 7.8% were post hepatic type of PHTN. Thirty-nine percent of total cases were EHPVO and 51% (26/51) of all PHTN cases had bled.

LSM and SSM values of cases (10.31 kPa and 10.26 kPa) were significantly higher compared with healthy controls (5.62 kPa, p 0.002). Further, SSM of non EHPVO group was significant compared to controls (11.10 kPa, p 0.01). There was negative correlation of LSM values and grade of varices, as highrisk varices were associated mainly with EHPVO. Conclusion SWE is a useful method for non-invasive assessment of PHTN in children, and may indicate the presence of varices. Further validation with larger group of patients is required.",

With the declaration of the World health Assembly, \"Elimination of viral hepatitis by 2030, it is high time we should seriously concentrate on raising awareness, preventing transmission, scaling up screening, vaccination and treating the infected people. The aim of the study was to see the impact of awareness on HBV vaccination. Method IMS and SUM Hospital is a tertiary care teaching hospital, we have the facility of free screening and vaccination of hepatitis B on all working days. This is a prospective study on people coming to the hospital for screening and vaccination against hepatitis B. Two dedicated staff speak to people on this infection, and the ways to prevent it. Pictures and posters are displayed in the vaccination area. After consent, screening and vaccination done. Finally, a leaflet on hepatitis B infection in local language is handed over to them. Results Between January 2017 to July 2018, 7246 people attended the clinic, 1315 opted for screening. One hundred and forty-five (11%) found to be HBsAg positive by the screening test. They were mostly (73%) in the age group 20-40 years. 7101 people were administered the first dose of vaccination. This study was aimed to see the impact of awareness on HBV vaccination. We found, 67% (4729) people completed the third dose of vaccination, 33% discontinued the vaccination schedule, mostly after first dose. Conclusion With the aim of creating awareness on the first visit, we are able to achieve 67% complete vaccination against hepatitis B. But with more awareness, health education, and involving media, we might able to achieve the expected >90% mark. Introduction Chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) and constipationpredominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) put significant healthcare burden on society that adversely impacts the quality of life of the general population. In PRucalOpride practice MappIng SurvEy (PROMISE), we aimed to understand and map the current clinical practice for diagnosis and management of constipation. Methods This was a cross-sectional and non-interventional survey that employed a structured paper-based questionnaire. This questionnaire was developed by the team of subject experts and reviewed by the practicing gastroenterologists. The objective of the questionnaire was to map the clinical practice and perceptions of Indian clinician who are treating patients with chronic constipation. Results Constipation dominates the gastroenterology focused clinical practice with a 30% to 40% share of total number of out-patients. Investigationbasedmanagementofconstipationiscriticalatthetertiary (gastroenterology) level to rule out the secondary causes. In addition to hemogram, thyroid profile, abdominal ultrasound and colonoscopy are often used laboratory investigations. Bulk-forming agents, osmotic laxatives and prokinetic agents are the preferred first, second and third therapeutic options, respectively. Approximately 20% to 40% of patients with constipation fail on conventional laxative therapy and stand to get significant benefit from prokinetic drugs like prucalopride which has been rated as efficacious and safe by responding clinicians. Conclusion Many patients don't respond to conventional laxative therapy despite the availability of multiple laxative agents. The newer oral agent such as prucalopride is going to have a definite place for managing difficult to treat constipation.",

(2) To determine the prevalence of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy in cirrhotic patients at our centre. (3) To study the prognostic implication of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy on survival at 3 months post liver transplantation. Method This prospective study was conducted from July 2016 to July 2017 at Gleneagles Global Hospital and Health City, Chennai. Patients, who were diagnosed as cirrhosis of liver based on clinical, biochemical, imaging and endoscopic findings, were included in study. After informed consent, details of demography. co-morbidity and cirrhosis related complication were noted. Cardiac evaluation included ECG, 2D echocardiography, dobutamine stress test and coronary angiography whenever indicated. Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy was diagnosed based on the standard criteria. Patients who underwent liver transplantation were followed up in the post-transplant period up to 3 months. Statistics Mann-Whitney U test, chi-Square test, Kaplan-Meier survival plot. P value of <0.05 was considered significant. Results Five hundred and eighty-six adult patients with cirrhosis of liver underwent cardiac evaluation. One hundred and ninety-eight (33.8%) patients were diagnosed with cirrhotic cardiomyopathy. One hundred and eighty-nine (80.3%) were males and alcohol was most common etiology (43, 21.7%). Patients of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy were significantly older (p<0.00001). QTc prolongation, diastolic dysfunction and systolic dysfunction on stress were more common in patients with cirrhotic cardiomyopathy. Post liver transplantation, there was improvement in diastolic dysfunction in a third of patients (12; 29.3%). There was no statistically significant difference in survival among patients with or without cirrhotic cardiomyopathy (p 0.23) at 3 months. Conclusion Prevalence of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy is 33.8%. It is commoner in older patients but is independent of etiology of cirrhosis, comorbid states and severity of liver disease. It does not affect short-term survival in patients undergoing liver transplantation.",

We aimed to review the non-invasive imaging technologies currently used for assessing systolic and diastolic function in cirrhosis. Methods A total of 50 subjects, were enrolled with cirrhosis of liver after excluding any known cardiac illness and other etiologies causing cardiomyopathy. Patients were subjected to sonographic evaluation to establish the diagnosis of cirrhosis of liver. We divided the subjects in two group according to their model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score (Group A >10.5 MELD and Group B <10.5 MELD). Cardiac assessment was performed non-invasively using 2D-STE and the strain (S) and systolic strain rate (SRS) values belonging to the circumferential (C), and longitudinal (L) functions of the LV were measured. Results A very high prevalence of diastolic dysfunction was found among the study group. Significant statistical correlation in longitudinal strain ( -19.47 \u00b11.20, -21.85\u00b11.1, p value <.001) and strain rate (-1.2\u00b10.18, .1.26\u00b10.13, p value <0.001) was observed. There is also significant correlation between circumferential strain ( -24.5\u00b11.93, -.25.0\u00b12.43, p value <0.001), however there is no correlation found in circumferential strain rate (-1.40\u00b10.3, -1.42 \u00b10.22, p value .412) (p-value 0.0451). Conclusion Cirrhotic patients have a high prevalence of diastolic dysfunction. In the absence of any known cardiac causes it should be attributed to cirrhosis itself. 2-STE can be routinely done in cirrhotic patients to detect cardiac dysfunction.",

Presenting complaints included loss of appetite in 74%, weight loss in 70%, abdominal pain in 58%, hemetemesis in 36%, abdominal distension in 32%, jaundice in 22%, hepatic encephalopathy in 12% and skin lesionpityriasis rotunda in 2% cases. The risk factors were hepatitis B virus (HBV) in 62%, hepatitis C virus (HCV) in 16%, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in 16%, HBV and alcohol in 4% and no risk factor in 2% patients. Sixty percent of patients had underlying cirrhosis while 40% were non-cirrhotics. Lesion was single in 60% while multiple in 40%. HCC most commonly involved right lobe, accounting for 52%. Patients having ascites had significant greater mortality at 1 year (p=0.025). Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) increased the mortality at 1 month (p=0.002) and 1 year (p=0.001) follow up. Higher short-term and long-term mortality with increasing Okuda stage at 1 month (0.05) and at 1 year (p=0.001) was observed. Conclusion Most patients belonged to 5th decade. Hepatitis B was the commonest etiology. Decreased appetite was the commonest complaint. Most had single lesion and involved right lobe. Ascites, PVT and Okuda staging have prognostic significance. Introduction Insulin resistance is considered as the major contributor for the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but it is evident that genetic polymorphism also contributes for the development of necroinflammation and subsequent progression of disease. This study was aimed to compare the effect of insulin resistance and genetic polymorphism on the development of NAFLD. Methods Forty-seven subjects with NAFLD and thirty-four controls were selected for the study after ultrasonography of eighty one consecutive apparently healthy subjects. Anthropometric profile (body mass index [BMI], waist circumference [WC] etc.) lipid profile, hepatic aminotransferases, fasting blood glucose (FBG), were recorded and value of homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was analyzed. PNPLA3 genotyping was also done. To see the association between insulin resistance, and genetic polymorphism with NAFLD was evaluated by multivariate logistic regression analysis after adjusting for potential confounding variables. Risk analysis was performed by calculating the odds ratio (OR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI). Results It was found that 62.5% individual having fatty liver had only insulin resistance without genetic polymorphism and 51.61% individual having fatty liver had genetic polymorphism without insulin resistance. Regarding PNPLA3 polymorphism 80% of the fatty liver group and 55% of the non-fatty liver group showed polymorphism. A subject with PNPLA3 polymorphism had 3.33 (95% CI 1.235% to 8.998%) times increase in odds having NAFLD. A subject with HOMA-IR >1.6 had 4.375 (95% CI 1.525% to 12.55%) times increase in odds having NAFLD. Conclusion Insulin resistance seems to be more responsible for the development of NAFLD than genetic polymorphism. Individuals having both factors are mostly vulnerable.",

Splenomegaly along with splenic congestion secondary to splenic hyperdyanmic circulation is seen in cirrhotic patients. These changes can be quantified by elastography. The aim of this study was to investigate whether spleen stiffness, assessed by TE, useful tool for grading chronic liver diseases and to compare its performance in predicting the presence and size of esophageal varices in liver cirrhosis patients. Methodology One hundred and twenty-six patients full filling inclusion and exclusion criterion were taken into the study. All patients underwent transient elastography of liver and spleen for the assessment of liver stiffness (LSM) and spleen stiffness (SSM). Cirrhotic patients underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to assess esophageal varices. Results Spleen stiffness showed higher values in liver cirrhosis patients as compared with controls: 54.2 kpa vs. 17.8 KPa (p<0.0001). In liver cirrhosis, spleen stiffness was significantly higher in patients with varices compared with those without (72 vs. 46 KPa, p <0.0001) 46 KPa being the best cut-off value. liver stiffness was also found to be higher in cirrhotic patients with varices when compared to patients without varices (38 vs. 26). Using both liver and spleen stiffness measurement we can correctly predicted the presence of esophageal varices. Conclusion Spleen stiffness can be assessed using transient elastography, its value is high in cirrhotic patients. In liver cirrhosis patients spleen stiffness can predict the presence, but not the grade of esophageal varices. Esophageal varices better predicted when both spleen and liver stiffness measurements are used.",

Methods Carotid atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk factors were assessed in 38 patients with an ultrasound diagnosis of primary NAFLD and 34 age and sex matched controls attending the MGE OPD, MMC and RGGGHS, Chennai from February 2017 to January 2018 were prospectively evaluated. Anthropometric factors-waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting serum samples were analyzed for glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol and its fractions, alanine and aspartate transaminases, gammaglutamyl transferase and C reactive protein. Liver ultrasonographic scanning was used for assessing fatty liver, carotid atherosclerosis was assessed by B-mode ultrasonography of common carotid artery and internal carotid artery and the relation between the two was observed. Results The metabolic syndrome and its traits, including elevated Creactive protein, were significantly (p<0.005) more frequent in NAFLD patients than in control subjects. Patients with NAFLD showed more carotid atherosclerosis than controls, with mean intima-media thickness (IMT) of 0.85\u00b10.30 mm and 0.48\u00b10.17 mm (p<0.0001) and plaque prevalence of 62% and 28% (p=0.020), respectively. The level of carotid IMT was more in cases than in controls which was statistically significant.

Results Mean age of presentation 38\u00b110.4 yrs. 66.67% (8) were males, 33.33% (4) were females. Mean duration of symptoms was 42\u00b111.6 months (range 1-236 months). Hepatic vein thrombosis (HVT) was present in 9 cases (75%), Inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis was present in 1 case (8.33%), both IVC and HV thrombosis were present in 2 cases (16.67%). Two cases (16.67%) presented acutely, 7 cases had subacute asymptomatic presentation (58.33%), 2 cases presented with compensated chronic liver disease (16.67%), 1 case presented with decompensated chronic liver disease (8.33%). All the cases were tested for hypercoagulable states. One patient (8.33%) had APLA syndrome, 1 patient (8.33%) had Myelodysplastic syndrome with JAK2 mutation, 2 patients had increased homocysteine levels (16.67%), 2 cases had protein C deficiency (16.67%), 1 patient (8.33%) had increased homocysteine levels and APLA. In 5 cases (41.67%) no cause was found after extensive work up. One case had spontaneous recanalization of hepatic vein, IVC balloon angioplasty was done in 1 patient, HV stenting was done in 1 patient, 1 patient was referred for transplant, rest of the 8 patients were only managed with anticoagulants. Patients with chronic liver disease were put on diuretics, beta blockers. Conclusion In our series, HVT was the predominant cause of BCS. Nonsurgical management was successful in most cases. Introduction Recent studies have shown a significant association between diabetes mellitus with fatty liver and hepatic fibrosis, and AMP; NBSP; but the prevalence of fibrosis and cirrhosis in diabetes mellitus is poorly known. The study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of hepatic fibrosis in patients with diabetes mellitus irrespective of and AMP; NBSP; the fatty liver. Methods The study was conducted in the specialty of Gastroenterology. SKIMS. Three hundred and seventy-four diabetic patients having diabetes of more than 5 years duration with age more than 19 years, irrespective of type of diabetes and complications associated with diabetes were assessed and AMP; NBSP; for the presence of fibrosis and cirrhosis. Fibrosis was assessed non-invasively and AMP; NBSP; by fibroscan using and AMP; NBSP; standard M probe. Severe fibrosis was considered if the score was 7 kpa or more and a score of 14 kpa or more indicated cirrhosis. Patients with fibrosis and cirrhosis were evaluated further to rule out any other cause for fibrosis and cirrhosis. Results One hundred and nine (29.14%) had normal fibroscan (and AMP; LT; 7 KPA),117 (31.28 %) had severe fibrosis and 148 (39.57 %) had cirrhosis which was statistically significant. 77/148 (52.03%) and 14/148 (9.46 %) had features of portal hypertension in the form of varises and potal hypertensive gastropathy respectively. High fibroscan was strongly associated with age, duration of diabetes, complication of diabetes and glycemic control. BMI, ALT and triglyceride levels were not associated with fibrosis.",

Marked increase in IP and BT may occur due to a surge in portal hypertension in acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). Control of large ascites in patients with ACLF using slow albumin-furosemide infusion with or without terlipressin and noradrenalin (SAFIT NA) may decongest the bowel and reduce the increased IP, which may improve 28 days survival. Methods ACLF of according to CLIF-SOFA and MELD \u226535 were included. Consecutive patients with CVP \u226510 cmH2O received CMT (Arm I) using slow infusion of furosemide (2 mg/ hour), albumin (2 gm/hour; 20-40 g/d); (SAFI), NAC and oral probiotics in addition to SMT for complications of ACLF. Furosemide was stepped up gradually based on urinary sodium (UNa+) excretion. If UNa+ still remained <85 mmol/d, terlipressin infusion [SAFI(T)] was started at 4mg/24 hrs, (max. up to 8 mg/24 hr).

Methodology Blood samples were collected from clinically characterized lean NAFLD (n=26), DM2 linked NAFLD cases (n=21) and healthy controls (n=35) with clinical details and informed consent. All mRNA and protein based expression profiles were studied by realtime-PCR and ELISA respectively. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS. Results A distinct upregulation of Th1 cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-12 and IFN-gamma, and a downregulation of Th2 cytokine IL-10 was observed in both the case cohorts compared to controls. Increased serum endotoxin levels were observed in cases (highest in DM2-NAFLD cases) compared to controls, and was associated with increased LFT profile markers, significantly with GGTP levels. The sTLR2 protein expression, associated with regulated immune responses, was significantly downregulated in both the case groups compared to controls. The cellular TLR2 mRNA expression was increased in DM2-NAFLD cases (3.13\u00b11.97folds), and more than 12 folds (12.41\u00b16.57folds) in non-etiological NAFLD cases compared to controls. Increased cellular-TLR2 expression correlated positively with Th1 cytokine expression at mRNA level. The mRNA expression of my D88 was upregulated by 2.76\u00b11.93 folds in NAFLD cases compared to controls; and correlated positively with both cellular-TLR2 and TNF\u03b1 expression.",

Background and Aims We evaluated the safety and efficacy of Sofosbuvir in CHC patients with CKD. Methods During last 5 years, around 68 CHC patients visited the Department of Gastroenterology, Aster MIMS, Calicut. Eleven patients lost to follow up and 6 patients were terminally ill. Twenty-four CHC patients with CKD with eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 were included in the study. All patients with genotype 3 were treated with full dose Sofosbuvir [400 mg) on the day of hemodialysis plus full-dose Daclatasvir (60 mg) given daily for either 12 or 24 weeks. All patients with Genotype 1 were treated with fixed dose combination of Sofobuvir + Ledipasvir on the day of hemodialysis. The efficacy was assessed by the sustained virological response (SVR12) with negative HCV RNA 12 weeks after the end of treatment (ETR). Results The median HCV RNA level in 24 patients was 6,66,109 copies/mL with 15 (62.5%) patients having HCV genotype 1a, followed by genotype 3 in 9 (37.5%) patients, respectively. All patients with underlying cirrhosis/fibroscan score and gt; 15 kpa and hepatocellular carcinoma were excluded 22 (91.6%) patients achieved ETR, and 24 (100%) patients attained SVR12. All patients tolerated the DAAs well with none of the patients reporting any serious adverse events. Minor side effects noted were nausea, insomnia and headache in 2 (8.3%) patients each. Conclusion Sofosbuvir plus full-dose Daclatasvir or Ledipasvir are safe and effective in treating CHC in patients with CKD with eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2.",

Currently, the mortality predictions are done using model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and MELD-Na, both of which have multiple drawbacks. The aim of this study was to compare MELD and MELD-Na with KAM that incorporates Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), age and MELD score. It is used to predict 3-month mortality and can also be used to select and prioritize patients for liver transplantation. Methods Seventy-two patients of liver cirrhosis were listed over a period of 13 months for a prospective observational cohort study. The quantitative variables obtained were compared using unpaired t-test and ANOVA. Receiver operating characteristic curve was used to find out area under curve of KPS, age and MELD score. Diagnostic tests were used to find out sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values. Results Out of 72 patients, 30-day mortality was 16.66% and 90-day mortality was 23.61%. In predicting 30-day mortality, KAM score had the highest AUC (=0.681497) while MELD and MELD-Na were not statistically significant. However, when predicting 90-day mortality, MELD-Na had the AUC=0.680283 with p-value of 0.0285 followed by MELD score having AUC=0.648128 having p-value of 0.0663. KAM score was not found to be statistically significant. Conclusion The KAM model was better at predicting 30-day mortality but was unreliable in predicting 90-day mortality. MELD-Na was more accurate than MELD in predicting 90-day mortality. The addition of Na+ to MELD improved its prognostic accuracy.",

This study aimed to compare characteristics of patients defined by these disparate diagnostic criteria for ACLF. Methods This is a prospective observational study. Consecutive patients of decompensated chronic liver disease admitted to a Gastroenterology department of a tertiary care hospital of Odisha from December 2017 to June 2018 were screened for the presence of ACLF either according to APASL or EASL criteria. The patients satisfying either or both of these criteria were included in the study and followed up. The patient's demographics, baseline laboratory parameters and mortality rate were compared using appropriate statistical tests. Results A total of 109 patients were included in the study. Majority were males (85.3%) with mean age of 45.26\u00b110.96 years and alcohol being the etiology in 81(74.3%) patients. Out of 109 patients, 72 (66.1%) patients had ACLF according to APASL definition, 59 (54.1%) patients had ACLF according to EASL definition and 22 (20.2%) had ACLF according to both. In APASL group, recent alcohol intake was the commonest (58.3%) acute precipitant whereas in EASL group bacterial infection (52.5%) was the commonest acute precipitant. Twenty-eight day mortality was significantly higher in patients satisfying both definitions (63.6%) than either APASL (16%) or EASL group (24.3%); p<0.001.

Recent epidemiological studies have shown increase in prevalence of AIH among elderly, but it has been rarely reported from India. The aim was to study the characteristics of AIH in elderly Indian population. Methods Patients with diagnosis of AIH based on the revised international autoimmune hepatitis group scoring criteria were recruited from 2011 till 2017 for this study. Patients were defined elderly as more than or equal to 60 years and young as <60 years of age. Clinical, serological, histological characteristics and treatment outcome with follow up till 12 months were analyzed and compared between both the group Results Out of 150 patients, 30 were elder. Females were predominant in younger group (90%) as well as in elder patients (70%). Total bilirubin and alanine aminotransferases level were significantly higher in younger patients as compared to elderly group (p<0.05). Chronic presentation including cirrhosis was more common in elderly patients (76% vs. 38%, p=0.01). On histology presence of interface hepatitis, lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, Rosette formation was similar but cirrhosis was significantly more in elderly group as compared to younger group. Prevalence of conventional autoimmune marker was similar in both the groups. Complete response to treatment at the end of 12 months were similar in both the groups (70% vs. 81%, p=0.6). However incomplete response to treatment at one year was seen in younger. Due to increased prevalence of co-morbidities including severe osteoporosis appropriate immunosuppressant could not be started in 10% of elderly patients. Conclusion AIH is an important differential diagnosis among elderly Indian population. They present with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis more commonly than younger patients. When given appropriate immunosuppressant they have similar outcome as compared to younger population.",

We conducted a systematic review of the available data on anti-HCV seroprevalence in the Indian population. Methods We searched several publication databases for English language papers that reported data on anti-HCV seroprevalence from India, and also identified other unpublished sources of such data. Data on groups likely to represent seroprevalence in general population and in selected high-risk groups were extracted and subjected to meta-analysis. Results Of the 3995 published papers and 94 additional data sources identified, 327 were selected; these provided 414 anti-HCV seroprevalence data points. Pooled anti-HCV seroprevalence rates in community-based studies, blood donors and pregnant women were 0.85% (95% CI: 0.00%-3.98%), 0.44% (0.40-0.49) and 0.88% (0.21-1.90), respectively. Among groups considered at high risk of HCV, pooled anti-HCV seroprevalence rates were as follows: people living with HIV (40 studies from 17 states: 3.51% [2.43-4.76]), persons on maintenance hemodialysis (37, 13, 19.23% [13.52-25 .65]), people who inject drugs (46, 14; 44.71% [37.50-52 .03]), multitransfused persons (38, 12; 24.06% [20.00-28.36 ]), persons with sexuallytransmitted diseases (7, 5; 4.10% [0.98-9.04]) and those with high-risk sex behavior (6, 5; 4.06% [1.79-7 .10]). Conclusions Community-based data on HCV seroprevalence in India were limited. Large amount of data on blood donors and pregnant women were found, with pooled anti-HCV seroprevalence rates of 0.44% and 0.88%, respectively. Among high-risk groups, anti-HCV prevalence was higher among persons living with HIV, those with sexually-transmitted diseases or high-risk sex behavior, injectable drug abusers, and those receiving hemodialysis or frequent transfusions.",

Introduction Acute liver failure (ALF) is a multiorgan failure syndrome with dramatic clinical features and often a fatal outcome. It is defined by severe acute liver injury along with hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy, within 6 months and usually <6 weeks, without any previous liver disease. The disease has high mortality rate and complications are quite common. This study aims to study the etiology, outcome, mortality and complications in ALF. Methods A cross sectional study conducted over a year involving 100 cases was performed which were diagnosed as ALF on basis of liver function tests, PT and INR and clinical examination. The clinical outcome, mortality rate and etiological factors were then assessed. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. Results A total of 100 patients were included in the study of which 63 were males and 37 females. Out of 63 males, 25 were discharged and 38 expired. Out of 36 females, 21 females were discharged and 15 expired. Among 36 females, 9 females were pregnant. Major cause among pregnant females mortality was hepatitis E virus. Mortality in our study was 53%. Overall the most common cause was viral followed by drug induced failure followed by no cause found followed by autoimmune hepatitis. Among viral etiologies hepatitis B was overall predominant cause followed by hepatitis E. Various factors like grade of hepatic encephalopathy, level of serum bilirubin, lactic acidosis in arterial blood gas, derangement of coagulation profile, derangement of renal function determines outcome of the patient. Complications were present in all patients. The major complication which needed urgent attention was hemodynamic instability followed by deranged coagulation profile followed by raised intracranial pressure. Conclusion ALF is a disease with significant mortality with viral etiologies as major cause. Management includes prompt diagnosis, aggressive approach and appropriate treatment of complications which increases chance of recovery.",

The duration of viremia and fecal viral shedding during this illness is short. However, no data are available on the temporal profile of viral titer in the blood and feces. Methods Serial serum and stool specimens were collected on alternate days from patients with acute hepatitis E (ALT >5-fold ULN; IgM anti-HEV positive) presenting within 7 days of onset of symptoms. HEV RNA titer was measured in these specimens using a real-time amplification assay. fold ULN) provided 113 serum specimens and 71 stool specimens). The profiles of titer of viremia and fecal viral excretion in these patients are shown in the figure. The level of viremia as well as viral excretion declined rapidly within the initial few days after enrolment. HEV RNA began to disappear in both serum and stool beginning at around day 14 of illness and had disappeared by day 21 of illness in all the subjects. Conclusion The level of viremia and fecal excretion of HEV parallel each other, decline rapidly after the onset of illness and disappear by day 21 of illness. This information should be helpful in better understanding the dynamics of HEV infectiousness and transmission. Introduction Portal vein thrombosis generally refers to a complete or partial obstruction of portal venous blood flow due to presence of a thrombus in the lumen of the vein or due to malignant obstruction of portal vein. Correct management by adopting adequate diagnostic and therapeutic measures is paramount. Hence this study was done with the aim to study the incidence, prevalence, etiology of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) patients and correlation with the severity of liver disease. Methods We conducted an observational cross sectional study of patients of PVT in outpatient department as well as hospitalized patients in the Medical Gastroenterology of our hospital (n=70). All patients with PVT on USG abdomen/PV Doppler/CT abdomen were identified. BAVENO VI classification (2015) was used to classify patients with cirrhotic PVT. Results Among the 70 patients we had, 51 (72.8%) were males and 19 (27.1%) were females. Acute/recent presentation was in 8/56 patients. Cirrhosis (n=48), hepatocellular carcinoma (n=7) were major liver related causes. Acute severe pancreatitis (n=8) were major non-liver causes. Among patients with cirrhosis major causes were alcohol (n=36), hep B (n=8), hep C (n=4). Mean MELD score was 17. Two patients presented as ACLF. One patient has undergone liver transplant. Majority of cirrhotic patients were in CPS B (79.1%) and CPS A (10.4%). Majority of PVT were in portal vein main trunk (Type 1) and were non-occlusive. Conclusions The occurrence of PVT correlates with the severity of liver disease with the incidence being high in patients with cirrhosis. Patients awaiting liver transplantation need to be treated in selected cases. Female caregivers had significantly low scores in physical, social and environmental domains. 15%, 70%, 15% had mild to moderate, moderate to severe and severe burden respectively on ZBI with significant inverse relationship between physical, social and environmental domains of WHOQOL-Bref and caregiver burden. CGs with low anxiety and depression scores had better quality of life (QOL). The factors not significantly influencing QOL were age, residence, duration of caregiving, socioeconomic status, number of previous hospitalizations, Child-Pugh and MELD scores, and presence of hepatic encephalopathy in the patients. Conclusion Caregivers of liver cirrhosis patients had low quality of life scores in all domains of WHOQOL-Bref. Caregivers who had high caregiver burden had low QOL scores and those who had low anxiety or depression scores had better QOL scores. The study emphasized the importance of the health and wellbeing of the caregivers; this is also likely to affect the care provided to and outcome of the patients.",

Conclusion Despite knowing about the key role of ammonia in ALF, no much importance is giving for decision making criteria for transplant surgery. Our study observed that the high ammonia level is associated with more mortality. Better care with ammonia lowering therapies may improve survival in ALF patients.

However, the biological effect of un-modified/non-functionalized bi-metallic magnetic nanoparticles remains under investigated. Herein we demonstrate a multifaceted non-functionalized bi-metallic inorganic Gd-SPIO nanoparticle which passes dual high MRI contrast and can be quantified inside cancer cells using unique technology. Methods We used flow cytometry-based side scatter analysis to determine the nanoparticle load in liver cancer cells with different time points. The results of the present study demonstrate that Gd-SPIO nanoparticles have potential to enter inside the cancer cells in time dependent manner which can be quantified using side scatter analysis in flow cytometry. Cellular interaction with MNPs was determined with SEM analysis whereas MNPs internalization was confirmed by TEM analysis. Further the uptake of MNPs by cells was identified by prussian blue staining of cells at each time point of incubation with MNPs. SYBR green-based qRT-qPCR was performed to evaluate the changes in gene expression and miRNA expression levels pre and post-nanoparticles exposure. Results The flow cytomtery-based analysis represents a real-time quantitative measure of MNPs interaction with cancer cells and its integration with imaging techniques represents a multi-variant platform to monitor nanoparticles uptake and intracellular processing in real-time at single-cell level. T1 and T2-weighted dual-MRI contrast property of Gd-SPIO nanoparticles was also identified using 1.5T Magnetome. The study also demonstrated that Gd-SPIO nanoparticles have potential to induce cancer cell death by production of reactive oxygen species and apoptotic events. Furthermore, Gd-SPIO nanoparticles also enhance the expression levels of miRNA-199a and miRNA-181a-7p which results in decreased levels of cancer markers such as C-met, TGF-\u03b2 and hURP. Conclusion The present study paves a way for future investigation of un-modified inorganic nanoparticles to purport enhanced payload in combination with potential anti-tumor drugs/molecules in cancer cells.",

Despite availability of several kinds of therapeutic molecules, consistent increase in drug resistance has been observed in various types of cancers. Despite promises of novel cancer therapeutic approaches, several crucial challenges have remained to be overcome for successful clinical translation of available agents. Hence, the present study was aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of bi-metallic gadolinium super-paramagnetic iron oxide nanoformulation of ascorbic acid (AA-GdSPIO) in synergism with hyperthermia on ascorbic acid-resistant cancer cells. Methods Unique nanoformulation of AA with Gd-SPIO was achieved by a simple procedure of establishing different ratios. Extensive chemical characterization of the generated Redox-nanoprobe was evaluated by UV-vis spectra, XRD, SEM, TEM and DLS studies. Effect of Redoxnanoprobe was evaluated using different concentrations and time points on normal and AA-resistant cancer cells alone and in combination with hyperthermia. Dark field and MRI-contrast imaging was performed to determine the loading of redox-nanoprobe in AA-resistant cancer cells. RT-qPCR analysis was performed to determine the quantitative reversal of resistance mechanisms post-exposure to Redox-nanoprobe. Results UV-vis spectra of redox nanoprobe showed two individual peaks of AA and Gd-SPIO after mixing. The zeta potential showed negatively charged nature of Gd-SPIO nanoparticles, indicating the presence of particle size in the nanoregime. Bi-metallic redox nanoprobe internalized inside the AA-R cancer cells which was identified by dark-field and MRI-contrast imaging of cells in time dependent manner. Post-cellular internalization, the redox nanoprobe was found to generate the highest level of ROS with hyperthermia. The synergetic effect of redox nanoprobe with hyperthermia showed significant decrease in ABCB1 expression as compared to AA-R cells. Conclusion The present study describes an innovative, highly selective and efficient approach for real-time imaging and treatment Introduction Existing treatment for liver cancers largely fail due to the chemo r\u00e9sistance properties of cancer cells. High doses of drugs lead to systemic toxicity resulting in a multitude of unwanted adverse reactions due to their lack of availability at tumor site, poor tumor intake of drugs and rapid elimination. In present study, we investigated the effect of tagged anti-tumor drugs with ultra-small gold nanoparticles to investigate their effect on drugresistant liver cancer cells. Methods We developed a stable colloidal suspension of sorafenib-gold nanoconjugate (SF-GNP) of <10 nm size in aqueous medium for reverting the cancer drug resistance in SF-resistant liver cancer cells in a 3D ex-vivo model system. Quantitative estimation of the amount of SF binds on GNP was performed by HPLC. SF-resistant tumor cell colonies were developed in soft-agar by consistent exposure to IC50 dose of SF up to seven passages. Changes in colony number and cell death were identified post-nanoconjugate exposure to SF-resistant colonies and compared with the untreated groups. Results In vivo biocompatibility assay of SF-GNPs showed absence of systemic toxicological effects including hematological, biochemical and histological parameters. However, SF-GNP nanoconjugates significantly reduced (>80%) the percentage cell survival and the size and number of SF resistant solid tumor colonies of liver cancer cells in 3D model system. The exposure of SF-GNP nanoconjugate to SF resistant liver cancer cell colonies also provided evidence for anti-proliferative effect and reversal of drug resistance by elucidating the molecular regulatory mechanisms of extracellular matrix factor, tumor growth factor, hURP and drug transporter. Conclusion This particular strategy of using SF-GNP conjugate in treating SF resistant HCC cells may augment the possibility of SF and related drugs to reduce the load of drug resistance with lower dose and reduced adverse events in advanced cancer by evading the drug efflux mechanisms.",

Recent progress in gene expression profiling has shed more light on the prevalence of epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) in human cancer. To determine factors associated with mortality after the first TACE procedure. Methods Total of 5 patients underwent TACE as treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma. Clinical and biochemical parameters before TACE, and response after TACE, were evaluated. Circulating tumor cells, EMT markers were also evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). Results Most of the biomarkers cytokeratin 19, cytokeratin 18, Epi-CAM were found to be overexpressed in patients with HCC before TACE. The expression of all the biomarkers were gradually decreases after TACE procedures. The expression level of all the EMT markers such as vimentin snail, slug and twist also decrease after the TACE procedure. All the Biomarkers were confirmed as significant predictors. Conclusion These data suggest that further investigations are needed on the role of HCC biology in influencing responses to TACE. Prototypical characteristics of these markers have recently been proposed: ideally, they should be cost-effective, reproducible, and easy to evaluate also on pretreatment specimens, such as liver biopsy or liquid biopsy specimens. Objective Transjugular liver biopsy (TJLB) is widely used in adult patients when percutaneous liver biopsy is contraindicated. Our aim was to evaluate the safety, efficacy and utility of transjugular liver biopsy in pediatric patients who had significant coagulopathy or ascites precluding liver biopsy. Methods Eighteen children and adolescents (11 male) aged 8 to 18 years from January 2016 to March 2018 underwent the procedure (TJLB) under general anesthesia (14) or intravenous sedation (4). Standard percutaneous liver biopsy was contraindicated because of significantly elevated PT/ INR (?15.5/1.5) in 14 (77.8%) patients and thrombocytopenia (?60000/ dl) in 10 (55.5 %) patients. Among 18 children, 7 (38.8%) patients had actually severe derangement in both INR and platelet count. Clinically significant ascites was also present in 8 (44.5 %) patients. Initial provisional diagnoses before TJLB were comprised of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) (6), Wilson's disease (2), portal hypertension (PHTN) under evaluation (2), cryptogenic chronic liver disease (CLD) with hypersplenism (3), hepatitis B related cirrhosis (2) high SAAG ascites of unknown etiology (1), acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) (1) and aplastic anemia with acute liver failure (1). Results Adequate biopsy samples for a definitive diagnosis were obtained in 17/18 patients (technical success rate 94.4%). No major or minor complications were seen. A new diagnosis was established in 7 (38.8%) cases (2 AIH, CHF, chronic Budd-Chiari syndrome, congestive heaptopathy, non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis, and normal liver). Another 9 (50%) cases revealed the histopathology of initial suspected etiology (6 AIH, 2 Wilson's, 1 chronic hepatitis B) and helped us to start definitive treatment accordingly. In one case, admitted with acute on chronic liver disease, definitive diagnosis could not be reached due to acute hepatitis A virus induced cytopathic changes in the background of chronic hepatitis. Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical, laboratory, histopathological characteristics and the response to immunosuppression in children and adolescents with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). Methods We retrospectively reviewed the data of 24 children and adolescents with AIH, diagnosed from 2013 to 2018, in the of Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology clinic, AIIMS, New Delhi. Results A total of 24 children (age range from 1.3 to 18 years) were studied. 15 (62.5%) were females. According to simplified AIH scoring system, 14 (58.3%) cases were diagnosed as definite AIH and rest were probable AIH. The predominant mode of presentation was chronic hepatitis (75%) followed by acute liver failure (12.5%), acute hepatitis without liver failure (4.2%) and others (8.3%) like organomegaly, asymptomatic transaminitis. Classification of the patient population was grouped as AIH I (6), AIH II (8) and seronegative (10). The most notable clinical features were jaundice with dark urine (79.2%) and abdominal distension due to organomegaly (58.3%) while the most relevant laboratory parameters were the aminotransferases (87.5%) and high IgG (83.3%). Other autoimmune diseases were present in 21.7% cases and in 33.3% first degree relatives. In the histopathology the most important findings were the interface hepatitis (95.2%), moderate to severe portal inflammation (80.1%) and definite or incomplete cirrhosis (79.2%). During the standard treatment with steroid and azathioprine, 20 patients achieved complete remission with 2 cases showing treatment related side effects (glaucoma, growth failure). Two patients with ALF died during the waiting period of liver transplantation. Relapses were noted in 22.7% cases on tapering steroid doses. Conclusions AIH should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of both acute and chronic liver diseases in the children and treatment with combination of corticosteroids and azathioprine is an effective treatment option with few side effects.",

With low spontaneous clearance rates by the host immune system, approximately 85% of infected patients have increased risk for developing liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The mechanisms of HCV persistence remain elusive. Myeloid dendritic cells (MDCs) play an important role in the initiation of adaptive antiviral immune response by acquiring and processing antigens for specific T cells. In addition, While plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) participate in antiviral responses by producing large amounts of IFN-a/b. Present study was designed to rule out the role of MDCs and PDCs in HCV infected patients. Methods Total of 50 patients (anti-HCV positive with no viral load (n=10), acute HCV (n=10), chronic HCV (n=10), cirrhosis with HCV (n=10) and HCV related HCC (n=10)) and 10 age and gender matched control were enrolled in the present study. HCV load was quantified from serum samples by use of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). For DCs analysis, PBMCs were isolated by use of density-gradient separation using Ficoll Hypaque (Pharmacia) and analyzed by using flowcytometry with DCs specific antibodies. Results Hepatitis C infected patients showed a lower absolute cell count percentage of peripheral blood mDCs when compared to healthy controls, while only antibody positive HCV patients did not display any statistically significant differences with healthy individuals, thereby suggesting the lack of enrolment in peripheral blood of this dendritic cell subset during the HCV infection. Conclusion We speculate that during hepatitis C, the virus might prevent the activation of circulating myeloid dendritic cells (ILT3/CD11c+) conditioning the natural history of the hepatitis. Thus, an early assessment of mDCs using our gate strategy could give useful suggestions about the possible progression of infection, thereby proposing the early enrolment of the patients in treatment. 208",

It can cause chronic infection and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis and liver cancer. There is still limited access to diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis B in many resource-constrained settings, and many people are diagnosed only when they already have advanced liver disease. Recent evidences show that miR-122 decreases HBV replication through the inhibitory effect of p53 on HBV transcription, and consequently it acts as a tumor-suppressor through both a decrease in HBV replication and by directly targeting several key pathways. Hence we intend to investigate the role of key miRNAs including miRNA-122 in molecular pathogenesis of HBV infection to investigate therapeutic implications of miRNAs on the underlying host-HBV interaction and disease pathogenesis. Methods A total of 100 subjects, 50 healthy controls and 50 hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected subjects before and after 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months treatment with Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg were enrolled in the study.

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has been reported to be more. There is a compelling reason to believe this, because studies have shown an increased prevalence of HCV in type 2 DM. The study was conceived to find out the prevalence of Type 2 DM in HCV positive patients and its relation with genotype. Methods The study was a hospital-based case control study, conducted in the Department of Gastroenterology, Government Medical College Srinagar. All hepatitis C patients were enrolled and investigated as per the study design. Seventy cases and equally matched controls were included. Cases were thoroughly evaluated, and controls underwent GTT, HbA1c, serum insulin levels, HOMA-IR. Analysis was done using Open Epi 3.01, p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Results Amongst cases, the mean age was 45.97\u00b111.982 years; 67.14% had Genotype 3 and 32.85% Genotype 1. Cases and controls were compared on the basis of fasting blood sugars in three different ranges (\u2264100 mg%, 101-125 mg% and \u2265 126 mg%) and a 2 hour GTT at three different levels (<140 mg%, 140-199 mg% and \u2265200 mg%). Other parameters of comparison included HbA1C, serum insulin levels, HOMA-IR, BMI, LFT and lipids. Amongst all these only the difference in level of HOMA-IR (<2.5 in 45.71% of cases and 65.71% of controls) was statistically significant (p=0.0063). On comparing the diabetogenic potential of two genotypes on the basis of FBS and a 2-hour GTT, genotype 3 was found to be more diabetogenic.

For retrospective data, 200 hepatitis 'C' patients (Genotype 3) from 2011 to 2014 were analyzed with respect to patients' demography, quantitative hepatitis C RNA before treatment, during treatment and after treatment. For prospective study, 290 patients with hepatitis C genotype 3 were studied for two years (June 2015 to June 2017). They were enrolled both from IPD and OPD. These patients were detected HCV positive during blood donation, preoperative evaluation, evaluation of liver function tests etc. Results For retrospective group, SVR24 was achieved in 90.96% (171/ 188) patients on Peg-IFN alpha 2a plus Ribavirin (weight based) combination for a period of 24 weeks. For prospective group, SVR12 was achieved in 94.57% (157/166) patients on Sofosbuvir plus Ribavirin combination for a period of 12 weeks and 98% (98/100) patients on Sofosbuvir plus Daclatasvir combination for a period of 12 weeks among non-cirrhotics while as among cirrhotics SVR24 was achieved in 83.33% (20/24) patients on Sofosbuvir plus Ribvirin plus Daclatasvir combination for a period of 24 weeks. Conclusion Overall in retrospective group an SVR24 was 90.96% and in prospective group SVR12 was achieved in 94.57% on Sofosbuvir plus Ribavirin combination for 12 weeks, 98% on Sofosbuvir plus Daclatasvir for 12 weeks and in cirrhotic group, 83.33% achieved an SVR12 on Sofosbuvir plus Ribvirin plus Daclatasvir combination for 24 weeks. Background and Aims Baveno VI defines patients with compensated cirrhosis in whom endoscopy can be avoided as those with liver stiffness (LSM) by transient elastography (TE) <20 kPa and platelet count >150,000/mm 3 . The aim was to validate Baveno criteria to rule out HRV and to determine whether alternate parameters not including TE would be more accurate in ruling out HRV. Method Cross-sectional study evaluating patients with LSM>10 kPa who had endoscopy within 6 months of TE evaluation. Factors like hemoglobin, platelet, LFT, RFT, INR, etiology, LSM and MELD score were compared between the groups who had HRV and who did not have HRV. Results Study included 375 patients who underwent (TE) and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) from September 2016 to August 2017. Most common etiology was HBV followed by HCV, NASH and ethanol. Out of 266 patients satisfying Baveno criteria to rule out HRV, 262 patients did not have HRV. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) was 96 %, 90 %, 74% and 99 % respectively. Platelet count, Bilirubin, MELD and LSM significantly differed between patients who had HRV and those who did not have HRV. An alternative strategy excluding TE and including platelet count and MELD score was also used. No patients with MELD score 6 showed HRV irrespective of platelet count (sensitivity and NPV=100%). One out of 233 patients with MELD score 8 with was platelet >150000/ mm 3 had HRV. By using MELD 6 or MELD <8 and platelet >150000/ mm 3 criteria, 251 (67%) endoscopies could have been circumvented. While using Baveno criteria, 262 (70%) endoscopies could have been circumvented. Conclusion This study validates Baveno VI criteria defining patients in which screening endoscopy can be safely avoided. MELD 6 or MELD <8 and platelet >150000/mm 3 can be used when TE is not available.",

Guidelines recommend treatment mainly based on the liver enzyme values and liver biopsy is not possible in many cases because of its invasiveness. In this study we assessed liver fibrosis non-invasively using transient elastography among patients with a high viral load. Method One hundred consecutive newly diagnosed cases of chronic hepatitis B after excluding patients with cirrhosis and other risk factors such as ethanol use in toxic dose, metabolic syndrome etc. were enrolled into study. All patients were evaluated with LFT, ultrasound scan of liver and hepatitis B viral load. Transient elastography was performed in all patients with a high viral load of >2000 IU/mL. Data was entered in Microsoft Excel and analysed using IBM-SPS v 16.0. Results Out of 100 cases, 33 patients had a high viral load. Among these 33 cases 26 cases (79%) were having evidence of advanced fibrosis in transient elastography while only 11 cases (33%) were having an ALT level >2 times ULN. Conclusion In our study, among patients with high HBV viral load we observed that a significant proportion of patients were having advanced fibrosis despite having a near normal LFT. It will be useful to assess liver fibrosis non-invasively to decide on treatment strategies among patients with chronic hepatitis B.",

The in hospital mortality is also very high (30% to 50%). For diagnosis of SBP, use of a reagent strip may be an useful approach. In various studies it has shown high sensitivity, between 85% and 100%, and high specificity between 98% and 100% and NBSP; The principle is based on leukocyte esterase activity. A pyrrole esterified with an amino acid is used as the substrate; hydrolysis of the ester releases the pyrrole which in turn reacts with diazonium salt yielding a violet or purple azo dye in relevant pad of the strip. Methods Patients were enrolled from March 2017 to September 2017 in the study. The study was conducted at the Department of Gastroenterology, Lokmanya Tilak Medical College and AMP; General Hospital, Sion, Mumbai. Inclusion Criteria and NBSP Liver cirrhosis patients with ascites, who are hospitalized were included in this study. Exclusion Criteria 1. Ascites secondary to other etiologies (i.e. noncirrhotic cause of ascites). 2. Cirrhosis with ascites of tubercular etiology. 3. Those who have received antibiotics within last 2 week. 4. On antibiotic prophylaxis for SBP or patients with prior history of SBP. Results We had analyzed 64 patients in this study. and NBSP; at cut-off of 2+; sensitivity to diagnose SBP was 100%; specificity being 94%; PPV being 57% and NPV being 94%. Similarly at the cut off level of 3+; sensitivity decreased down to 76%; specificity increased to 100%; PPV of 100 % and NPV of 93.75 %. Overall accuracy at 2 + and 3 + was respectively 94.5 % and 93.75 %. Conclusion LERS strip test of ascitic fluid is a very sensitive and specific method for diagnosis of SBP. It is rapid, simple and cheap. Positive test calls for antibiotics at earliest. Introduction Pathophysiology of PHTG not well established till date. PHTG prevalence varies widely in DCLD patients from 36% to 67% among different etiology and 7% to 18% in non-cirrhotic PHTN. Most of studies clearly showed no correlation between PHTG and portal hypertension. Now hypothesis for PHTG development were local and systemic inflammatory factors due to underlying CLD, etiology of CLD and also duration of CLD play the major role. Aim We found out presence of PHTG across the common etiologies of DCLD including cryptogenic origin and correlation between PHTG and etiology of DCLD. Method We done retrospective cohort study, collected data from endoscopy registry of MGE Department from June 2018 to June 2016. We were included total 400 patients of DCLD (CTP class B/C) with established etiology and also cryptogenic who underwent endoscopy. In 400 patient 130 patient were ethanol, 70 patients were HBV, 60 patients were HCV, 80 patients were cryptogenic, 40 patients were NAFLD, 10 Wilson's, 6 autoimmune and 4 patients were secondary billiary cirrhosis related. PHTG in each group of patient calculated in percentage then association between etiology of DCLD and PHTG estimated by HR (hazard ratio) and CI using cox regression analysis in multivariate model and considered significant association when p value <0.05.",

Conclusion There is high prevalence of NAFLD in patients with T2DM (63.86%) based on abdominal ultrasound examination. Female sex, advanced age, obesity, visceral fat (higher waist circumference) and metabolic syndrome in patients with T2DM poses significant risk of development of NAFLD. The common clinical presentation of NAFLD in T2DM was abdominal pain followed by fatigue and these features are strongly associated with NAFLD. Also, lipids in the form of hypertriglyceridemia, lower HDL, and liver derangement in terms of elevated AST, ALT and deranged albumin levels significantly associated with high risk of NAFLD in patients with T2DM. NFS is a simple non-invasive scoring system which helps in identifying and screening at risk patients at a relatively lower cost.

However, the spectrum of clinical profile and prognostic factors have not been clearly studied. The aim of this study was to elucidate the clinical profile of patients presenting alleged poisoning with rodenticides and identify prognostic factors of outcome. Methods This was a retrospective study of all patients with proven poisoning with a rodenticide from January 2006 to November 2018. All relevant demographics including age, gender and comorbidities were recorded in a pre-designed performas. Patients were then studied for course in the hospital and outcomes with in-hospital mortality and/or liver transplantation performed on an emergency basis during the course of admission. Prognostic factors were then analyzed using SPSS v20. Results A total of 82 patients were included into the study with a mean age of 24.71 and a male to female ratio of 1.15. The majority of patients consumed the rodenticide with an intent to self-harm (67.1%). The most common rodenticide found was zinc phosphide (61%). Liver transplantation was performed in 17 (20.7%). Overall mortality was 14 (17.1%). On univariate analysis, younger age, female gender, accidental consumption, renal failure, hemoglobin <10 gm/dL, total WBC counts <4000 cells/dL and platelet count <100000 cells/dL were found to be significant predictors of poor outcome (p value <0.05). On multivariate analysis, accidental consumption, renal failure and hemoglobin <10 gm/dL were found to be independent predictors of poor outcome. Conclusion Poisoning with a rodenticide is common in India and has a poor prognosis. Younger age, female gender, history of accidental consumption and pancytopenia at presentation can portend a poor prognosis and help in risk stratification in these patients.",

It is a heterogeneous tumor and is associated with multiple signaling pathway alterations including Wnt and Hh signaling pathways. Despite the advances in HCC treatment it has poor prognosis and the 5 year survival rate is less than 20% across all stages. In most cases HCC is diagnosed at late stages and is associated with diverse histopathological characteristics. The range of cellular differentiation in HCC extends from well-differentiated to poorly-differentiated types and contains varied morphological subtypes. The widespread molecular nature of HCC across different grades is not known. Method In the present study we investigated the change in expression level of Wnt and Hh pathway molecules across different grades/stages of HCC. N-Nitrosodiethylamine (DEN) induced HCC model in male Wistar rats were used to study the expression level of Wnt and Hh pathway molecules at different stages of hepatocarcinogenesis. At the same time the findings of pre-clinical models were substantiated with the HCC patients' biospecimen data.",

Results Out of 50 patients 10 received rituximab alone (Group 1), 20 received anthracyclines based chemotherapy (Group 2) 20 received platinum based chemotherapy (Group 3). Reactivation developed in 3 patients in group 1 not receiving antiviral prophylaxis (p<0.005) out of which 1 were started on antivirals prophylactically and discontinued. Rest of the 7 patients received antivirals and had no reactivation. Four patients out of 20 in group 2 had reactivation and none of them was on antiviral prophylaxis. Four out of 20 patients in group 3 had reactivation in group 3 and all of them discontinued antiviral prophylaxis (p<0.005). Conclusion Hepatitis B reactivation is significant in patients receiving chemotherapy and antiviral prophylaxis reduces the chances of reactivation in such groups.",

All selected patients were followed from the beginning of treatment to 12 weeks after the end of treatment. Follow up included history and examination for any adverse drugs effects, blood analyses and clinical interviews (baseline and weeks 2, 4, and 12) during treatment and 12 weeks post treatment. Results Of the 124 patients who were treated for chronic HCV infection with genotype 3 virus 66 received Sofosbuvir with Daclatasvir while 58 received Sofosbuvir with Velpatasvir. Among the 66 patients treated with Sofosbuvir/Daclatasvir 60 patients (90.9) attained SVR. While in the 58 patients treated with Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir 56 patients (96.5) attained SVR. The significance of SVR on advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis (F3 and F4), previous treatment experienced were analyzed by chi-square test and were found not significant. Fatigue was the most common adverse event (AE), which developed in 45.45 % (n=30) patients treated with Sofosbuvir/Daclatasvir and in 31.03% (n=18) patients treated with Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir. AE were more in those with cirrhosis compared to non-cirrhotics. Conclusions The sustained virologic response with treatment was high in patients treated with Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir compared to Sofosbuvir/ Daclatasvir. Patients in the Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir group had lower adverse effects occurrence. Except one patient who developed severe sarcopenia other AE were few and mild and none result in discontinuation of treatment.

For elasticity characterization of FLLs, median of 5 consecutive stiffness measurements was used as a representative value for each lesion. Background liver stiffness was measured at 3 cm from the lesion periphery and lesion-parenchyma stiffness ratio was calculated. Results Sixty-eight patients, 37 males and 31 females, were included in the study. Thirty-one patients had cirrhosis and rest of the patients had normal background liver parenchyma. There were 33 malignant lesions including HCC with cirrhosis (23), IHCC (2) (out of which one patient had cirrhosis), De novo HCC (1), metastasis (7), and 35 benign lesions including hemangioma (15), FNH (4), abscess (5) and complex cyst (11). Mean stiffness of malignant lesions was 69.5 kPa, and that of benign lesions was 24.2 kPa. Mean stiffness of HCC (53.2 kPa) was lower than that of metastasis (62.4 kPa) and was higher than benign FLLs (24.2 kPa). Mean stiffness ratio of HCC (4.1) was lower than that of other malignancies. This may be due to the fact that HCCs were relatively softer especially in background of cirrhosis, when compared with other malignancies. According to this study FNH had highest stiffness among benign liver lesions (FNH-10.1, hemangioma -9.3, complex cyst -8.4, abscess -9.1 kPa). Conclusions SWE could be a useful method for the differentiation of benign and malignant FLLs. Stiffness value was better than stiffness ratio in characterizing FLLs.",

Biochemical parameters suggestive of acute kidney injury (AKI). Patient was taken for dialysis. His clinical condition deteriorated during the hospitalization and biochemical parameters showed rising blood phosphorus, potassium and uric acid and hypocalcemia. At this point of time diagnosis of tumorlysis syndrome was made. Patient was treated with adequate hydration, allopurinol and hemodialysis. His clinical condition deteriorated over the course of hospitalization and died of sepsis 10 days following hospitalization. Conclusion Tumorlysis syndrome following initiation of sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma is very rare. Less than five case reports regarding the same has been published till date. Hepatocellular carcinoma patient following sorafenib initiation if presenting with AKI we also have to think in lines of tumorlysis syndrome. Introduction Acute liver failure (ALF) is characterized by rapid and progressive loss of hepatic function and high plasma ammonia is shown to be associated with increased mortality. Damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) (HMGB1, HSPs and IL-33) have been shown to modulate systemic immune responses. We investigated role of circulating DAMPs and ammonia in modulation of immune cells in ALF. Methods Plasma was collected at day 0 and 3 to determine levels of DAMPs (HMGB1, heat shock protein 60/70, S100A8/9, SAA and IL-33) using ELISA. Phenotypic analysis of immune cells was done. Age matched 15 healthy controls (HC) were included. Results ALF patients (n=25, age 28+9 yr, 48% males, 75% viral etiology) had MELD 32\u00b110, SOFA 13\u00b13.9, J to HE duration 4.4+ 3.5 days, HE grade III-IV, 82% with cerebral edema, 50% meeting King's college hospital (KCH) criteria, 40% with suspected sepsis and ammonia levels 286.5 \u03bcg/dL (123-761). Ammonia had positive correlation with INR and MELD score (p<0.01) while DAMPs had negative correlation. HMGB1 (p=0.0428), HSPs and S100A9 significantly correlated with ALT levels while HMGB1 correlated with AST (p<0.05). DAMPs were significantly increased in nonsurvivors at day 3. In ALF, at day 0, immune cells showed significantly (p<0.05) reduced activation (CD16-neutrophils, HLADRmonocytes and NKG2D-NK cells), migration (CXCR1 and CXCR2-neutrophils) and increased adhesion (CD66B for neutrophils) markers. HMGB1 and HSP60 positively correlated with CD66B expression on neutrophils while ammonia levels negatively correlated with CXCR2 on neutrophils and HLADR expression on monocytes (p<0.05).

Results About 250 patients were enrolled in the study. Study population had a mean age of 56 years. Males predominated (83.2%). The survival rate in our study population was 86.4%. Multi drug resistant organism (19.2%), suboptimal ascitic fluid improvement, high child score and higher MELD score were independent predictors of mortality. SIRS (22.8%), higher creatinine level (mean of 1.48), higher INR (2.23 vs. 1.5) and lower sodium levels (122 vs. 129) was associated with higher mortality. Conclusion Gram negative organisms were the predominant group of organisms causing spontaneous ascitic fluid infections out of which Escherichia coli was the most common organism. Infection with multidrug resistant organisms and suboptimal response to initial antibiotic treatment indicated poor prognosis. Features of SIRS and renal dysfunction at admissions were the two parameters which showed highest association with mortality. Higher Child-Pugh-Turcot score, hyponatremia, higher bilirubin level were independent predictors of mortality. Sixty-five-year-old male referred from local Hospital for acute hepatitis B started on Tenofovir two weeks back. Without HBV DNA quantification due to worsening LFT. HBV DNA quantification and serology studies were consistent with acute hepatitis B with IgM HBc positive, IgG HbC negative, HBeAg positive and HBV DNA of 57000000. Bilirubin remained high with SGOT, SGPT showing dual spikes. Liver biopsy showed acute hepatitis. With a failure to response a second antiviral Entecavir was started. There was a clinical and biochemical response after one week, he was re-admitted with Ascites and INR 1.6. Hepatits D RNA PCR results came as 160000 copies IgM HDV positive and IgG HDV negative. HBV DNA was repeated after total 5 weeks of NA showing decrease to 2 logs. No specific therapy was started for hepatitis D owing to the decomposition. After supportive care for ALF he improved clinically and biochemically. A diagnosis of hepatitis B and hepatitis D co-infection was made depending on serological features of IgM HBc and IgM HDV positivity and natural history corresponding to co infection. Patient is currently on follow up. Conclusion HDV is a defective virus needs hepatitis B virus for survival. They can cause disease as a part of co-infection or superinfection with coinfection being rare and super-infection being severe and chronic. Hepatitis D virus prevalence vary geographically with India being a low prevalent country mainly due to contribution from Northern parts of India. There has been only single case series report of hepatitis D infection from South India, A study of prevalence of hepatitis D in hepatitis B patients undergoing dialysis in a tertiary Care Centre from Chennai.

There is a need for a simple prognostic score to predict 90-day mortality and liver transplant prioritization. We evaluated the albumin bilirubin index (SALBI), previously validated in hepatitis B ACLF as a predictor of 90-day mortality in alcoholic ACLF. Methods This is an interim analysis. Consecutive patients with alcoholic ACLF were included. Following scores were calculated on day 1 of admission-model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), MELD-Na, Chronic Liver Failure Consortium Acute on chronic liver failure [CLIF-C ACLF] and ALBI. Patients were followed until death or 90 days. Results Thirty-nine patients (44.90+7.81 yrs; 37 males) were included. Median MELD, MELD-Na, CLIF C ACLF and ALBI for patients who died was 34, 35, 100, \u22120.43 respectively as compared to 24, 29, 93, \u22120.71 in who survived (p<0.001 for all scores). The AUROC for MELD, MELD-Na, CLIF-C ACLF, ALBI was 0.891, 0.896, 0.982, 0.982 respectively; however, this was not significant (p -0.198). The ALBI score at \u22120.59 showed 96.2% sensitivity and 92.6% specificity in predicting 90day mortality. The ALBI according to Grade of ACLF was as follows: Grade 0 was \u22120.68 + 0.23, Grade1 was \u22120.64 + 0.2, and Grade 2 ACLF was \u22120.36+0.21 and Grade 3 ACLF was \u22120.35 + 0.18. Conclusions The ALBI was thus regarded as a sensitive and specific score to predict 90-day mortality in this interim analysis in patients with alcoholic ACLF. Background and Aims Gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) is an uncommon but important cause of chronic gastrointestinal bleeding. It is often associated with systemic diseases such as autoimmune diseases, liver cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency and cardiovascular disease. Patients with recurrent bleeding from GAVE are a challenge to treat. We investigated the efficacy and safety of thalidomide for refractory bleeding from GAVE in this pilot study. Methods Patients with GAVE bleeding and requiring ongoing transfusion were eligible for this open nonrandomized study. Thalidomide was started with 100 mg/day and continued for 6 months. Adverse events, hemoglobin, blood chemistry, and blood transfusion were monitored during the treatment period.",

            "text": "Background Lactoferrin is a iron-binding protein. Lactoferrin is found in various bodily secretions. Although elevated levels of lactoferrin provide a biomarker for inflammatory bowel diseases and colorectal cancer, the clinical significance of these elevated levels in ascitic fluid of patients with ascites caused by liver cirrhosis is limited. Very few studies have evaluated the clinical usefulness of ascitic fluid lactoferrin level in patients with liver cirrhosis. Parsi et al. assessed the utility of ascitic fluid lactoferrin level for the diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in patients with cirrhosis. However, few studies have evaluated the findings of Parsi et al. to clarify the clinical usefulness of ascitic fluid lactoferrin level for the diagnosis of SBP in patients with liver cirrhosis. We aim to study the usefulness of ascitic fluid Lactoferrin levels in patients of liver cirrhosis. Methods A cross-sectional study of 100 subjects, both male and female with ascites due to cirrhosis of liver presenting to the Department of Medical Gastroenterology in Osmania General Hospital from October 2017 to October 2018. Results Till date we have collected data from 86 patients. Ascitic fluid lactoferrin levels are measured using ELISA kits along with basic laboratory work up and routine ascitic fluid analysis. The median ascitic fluid lactoferrin levels were significantly higher in patients with SBP than in those without SBP. Conclusions Ascitic fluid lactoferrin level can be a useful diagnostic tool to identify SBP in patients with ascites caused by cirrhosis. Introduction Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of liver disease affecting 1.6 % of population. Indian data regarding safety and efficacy of directly acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for HCV infection is limited, hence the importance of this study. The primary objective was proportion of patients who achieved sustained virological response 12 weeks after cessation of treatment (SVR12). Secondary end point was adverse events due to DAAs. Methodology This was a three year, single-centre, observational study performed at a tertiary hospital in South India from April 2015-April 2018. All selected patients were categorized into 3 groups based on genotypes (1, 3, 4) and followed up with history and examination for any adverse drugs effects, blood analyses, clinical interviews at baseline and weeks 2, 4, and 12 and 12 weeks post treatment along with liver stiffness measurement using fibroscan pre and post-treatment. Those with genotype 3 received (Sofosbuvir+ daclatasvir or sofosbuvir+ velpatasvir ) +/-ribavirin and those with genotype 1 and 4 received (sofosbuvir+ledipasvir or sofosbuvir+velpatasvir) +/-ribavirin according to EASL guidelines and availability. Results Of the 210 patients, 46 were in genotype 1, 123 in genotype 3 and 41 in genotype 4. Overall rate of SVR12 was 91.8 % (n=192/210). Among 46 patients with genotype 1,SVR 12 was 100% (n=46/46) and among 123 patients with genotype 3, SVR 12 was 88.6% (n=109/123). 90.5% patients from genotype 4 (n=37/41) attained SVR12. Fatigue was the most common adverse event, 45.2% (n=95). The significance of SVR on overall advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis (F3 and F4) were analysed by chi-square test and were found not significant (p> 0.5). Conclusion The efficacy and safety of DAAs in HCV infected population in Indian scenario is comparable to Western standards. However low rates of SVR12 in genotype 3, the commonest genotype in India, needs to be addressed further.",

HBV is the most infectious but is preventable by safe and effective vaccination. The present retrospective study was aimed to know the prevalence of accidental exposure to these viruses and its management amongst the HCW. Study Design Present study was retrospective analysis of all HCW who voluntarily reported injuries by needle prick, sharps and splashes on cut skin and mucous membranes by blood/body fluids mainly to HBVand HCV. A detailed history of HBV vaccination, number of doses received was noted. HBsAg, anti-HBs and anti-HCV was performed in all and LFT wherever needed. Results The study included 41 HCW (21M/20 F) who reported during the period of 2012-2018. There were 20 doctors, 12 nurses, 7 laboratory personnel and 2 workers in the age group 18-45 yrs. Needle prick with known HBsAg positive during various procedures was the commonest (34/41) followed by splash (5/41) and spill over of blood or body fluids (2/41). HCV exposure was reported by 2HCW who had normal LFT and HCV seronegativity at baseline. Vaccination against HBV was reported in 33/ 41(80.4%) and anti-HBs was positive in 30/33 (90.9%). Anti-HBs was positive in 5/8 (62.5%) non-vaccinated subjects. Anti-HBs titres were in the range of <10, 10-50, 51-100 and >100 mIU/mL in 9.1%, 27.2%,18.1% and 45.4% respectively. A booster dose of HBV vaccine was administered in all with titers < 50 mIU/mL. HBIG was administered in all anti HBs negative HCW followed by active immunization. At 6 months follow up none of them developed chronic HBV or HCV infection. Conclusion 1) Immediate analysis of anti-HBsAg titre helps in avoiding HBIG. 2) HBIG administration required only in 18%. 3) Single booster dose is sufficient in HBV exposure in majority. 4) HCV is less efficiently transmitted hence can be managed by follow up LFTs and HCV RNA.",

But there is scarcity of data on whether vitamin A levels are associated with severity of cirrhosis and can be used as a prognostic marker in cirrhosis patients. Aim To study the relationship of serum vitamin A (retinol) levels with disease characteristics in patients of cirrhosis and to compare it with age and sex matched control group. Method Case control analytical study of forty-five consecutive patients of cirrhosis of liver with age and sex matched control group of forty-five healthy volunteers from February 2017 to September 2018. Results Serum vitamin A levels were significantly (p<0.05) lower among patients with cirrhosis (28.96\u00b19.63 \u03bcg/dL) compared to age and sex matched control group (62.36\u00b142.19 \u03bcg/dL).

            "text": "Introduction Primary liver tumor with combined histology of hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC) is a rare entity with an overall incidence varying from 0.4% to 4.7%. Lack of specific treatment guidelines, poor response to the various surgical and palliative therapeutic options often result in dismal outcome. Familiarity with the clinical and imaging features for differentiating from either Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or cholangiocarcinoma (CC) is important. Variable atypical findings depending upon the dominant component (cholangiocellular or hepatocellular) should raise an index of suspicion and final confirmation by histopathology. We present the clinical and imaging profile of cHCC-CC patients along with review of literature. Method Case records containing prospectively collected data of the patients reporting to our hospital were reviewed retrospectively. Data of histopathologically proven cHCC-CC patients with complete records were included. Demographic details, clinical features and imaging characteristics on multiphasic CT or MRI of the Liver were analyzed. Results Seven patients of mean age of 43.5+20.7yrs with male female ratio of 4:3 were evaluated. Abdominal pain (71 .4%) and anorexia (42.8%) were the commonest complaints. Three patients has hepatitis B related chronic liver disease and raised serum alpha-fetoprotein (>1000 ng/mL), one was hepatitis C positive. Four patients had single hepatic mass and three had multiple; the size varied from 3.3-18cms. The masses showed variable enhancement which included arterial phase hyper-enhancement, delayed washout or centripetal fill-in and with/without capsule enhancement. Pattern of enhancement of different masses was also different within the same patient. Biliary dilatation and lymph node enlargement was noted in 2 and 1 patient each. Only three patients could be given treatment (TACE [2] and oral sorafenib [1] Introduction Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is defined as an infection of ascites in the absence of a contiguous source of infection. SBP occurs in 10% to 30% patients with cirrhosis and ascites with in-hospital mortality rates from 20% to 30%. The diagnosis is by presence of an absolute PMN cells >250 cells/ mm 3 . This study was done to assess the response of cefotaxime on SBP as reports of resistance have emerged. Methods We conducted an interventional study involving 36 patients from June 2017 to June 2018. All patients with decompensated cirrhosis with ascites, having ascitic fluid PMN cells >250 cells/ mm 3 , with or without prior history of SBP, with or without symptoms of SBP, were studied and treated empirically with cefotaxime. Ascitic fluid was repeated at 48 hrs. and response was assessed by 25% decrease in PMN cells. Results Our 36 patients of SBP were 27 males and 9 females, among them 33% were Child score B and 66% were Child score C, with most common presentation being abdominal pain. The mean age was 42.5 years. Most common cause of cirrhosis was ethanol related (n=20). Mean MELD score was 17.5. However only n=25 (69%) patients achieved satisfactory response with at least 25% reduction of their PMN count. The remaining 11 patients (31%) were shifted to alternative antibiotics. The most common organism responsible was E coli. Conclusion As switch to another antibiotic was necessary to achieve resolution of infection in 31% of our patients, 3rd generation cephalosporins are no more the best first empiric choice of SBP. So, in patients with high MELD and child C cirrhosis we should plan to start higher antibiotic as empiric treatment. Also, there is an urgent need for clinical trials on alternative antibiotic for first line empiric therapy for SBP. Introduction 1n hepatic venous outflow tract obstruction (HVOTO-HCC) is rare entity which has recently come into limelight due to the availability of interventional treatment options for HVOTO resulting in prolonged survival. Treatment is challenging as both HVOTO as well as HCC needs to be treated for effective outcome. We highlight the management and outcome of these cases undertaken at our centre. Methods HVOTO-HCC patients presenting to our hospital were evaluated. Detailed clinical, biochemical and imaging examination was done. Ultrasound Doppler, multiphase CT liver/dynamic MRI/venography were undertaken. HVOTO treatment was based on the site and type of obstruction. Staging and treatment of HCC was based on the Barcelona Clinic liver cancer Staging (BCLC). Treatment response and survival was studied.",

The liver is an important intermediary site of vitamin D metabolism. Metabolism of vitamin D in the liver employs D-25-hydroxylase enzyme for the conversion of vitamin D into 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcidiol). This enzyme is encoded by the CYP2R1 gene. This study aims at analyzing CYP2R1 expression in liver biopsy tissue of patients with cirrhosis and diseased controls. Methodology The study was done on liver biopsy samples from 16 cirrhotic and 12 diseased controls (post-mortem liver biopsies of Crohn's disease, severe acute pancreatitis, acute liver failure, chronic pancreatitis and liver abscess patients). Total RNA was extracted from the biopsies by using commercial kits (Qiagen, RNA isolation kit). Concomitantly cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription by using high fidelity 1st strand cDNA synthesis kit (Agilent). The mRNA expression of CYP2R1 was estimated using the CYP2R1 specific primer by real-time PCR. Fold change was calculated using 2-\u0394\u0394ct. Appropriate statistical tests were used. A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant. Results Among cirrhotic patients, 12 were males and 4 were females and their mean age was 44.0\u00b113, 13 years. Out of 12 diseased controls, 5 were males and 7 were females with mean age of 38 \u00b112.8 years and measured serum bilirubin (mg%) in patients with cirrhosis was 17.3 (0.8-32) as compared to disease control was 1.3 (0.2-19.7) . The hepatic CYP2R1 gene expression was significantly decreased (2.8 fold) in cirrhotic patients as compared to its expression in diseased controls (p<0.05). Conclusion Serum bilirubin level is significantly high with the downregulated CYP2R1 gene in cirrhotic patients as compared to disease control, which explains hypovitaminosis D in these patients.",

Both females were pregnantprimi (2nd month gestation); 2nd gravida, (2nd month gestation). Two patients also had plasma exchange, none opted for liver transplantation. Results At presentation, serum total bilirubin : 16 (13-28) mg%, SGPT 1996 (1693-3568) IU/mL, INR 5.94 (3.6-8), plasma vWF antigen 327 (192-640) %, MELD 39 (31-39), SOFA score 8 (8-9) and hepatic encephalopathy grade 3 (3-4). Two patients needed mechanical ventilation. Two patients were HBsAg positive. All 3 patients were IgM core antibody positive, E antigen negative, had HBV DNA 20000 (2000 -7 lakhs) IU/mL and seronegative for hepatitis A, C, E and HIV. None had prior history of hepatitis B. Possible routes of HBV acquisition: sexual (1 patient); ear-piercing (1 patient). Tenofovir was started from day 1 of hospital stay; methyl prednisolone infusions (250 mg for 1 day, 500 mg for next 2 days) given 1-5 days later; then, prednisolone (40 mg/day) -tapered over 14 days.

With this background, objective of this study is to assess the cardiac functions in patients with chronic liver disease and study the prevalence of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy in these patients. Methodology A descriptive study conducted with 35 patients with diagnosed case of liver cirrhosis. Participants were enrolled after excluding any known cardiac illness and known causes of cardiomyopathy. Patients were subjected to biochemical and sonographic evaluation to confirm cirrhosis of liver. Cardiac assessment was performed non-invasively using ECG and transthoracic echocardiography. Results were interpreted using Chi-square/Fisher's exact test. A p value 0.05 was considered to be significant. Results Among 35 participants, mean age was-53.37 years (min-32, max-81) with 74% male and 26% female. Ascites (60%) and anorexia [60%] were most common presenting symptoms. 48% participants were in category of B as per Child-Pugh score. Mean MELD score was 27.6 (min-7, max-40). In cardiac assessment, 54% participants presented with Qtc prolongation in ECG and 71% and 29% presented with diastolic dysfunction grade I and grade II respectively. Mean ejection fraction was 70.57 (min-44, max-82) .Cardiac abnormalities did not correlate with the severity of liver dysfunction. Conclusion There is high prevalence of cardiac dysfunction amongst cirrhosis of liver. Diastolic dysfunction which is seen in all patients of cirrhosis suggest that all patients with cirrhosis of liver must be screened for cardiac dysfunction. This may help in planning fluid therapy especially in patients have hepatorenal syndrome.",

Now liver is concerned as another very important target organ of metabolic syndrome with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) being most common liver disease worldwide. Despite high prevalence of NAFLD, the most common cause of mortality amongst metabolic syndrome remains coronary artery disease (CAD). Objectives This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of NAFLD in CAD patients and relation of fatty liver disease with the severity of coronary artery disease. Methods This study was a cross-sectional descriptive-analysis research that included 83 patients who were proved CAD on angiography (>50% stenosis). The severity of CAD was assessed by the number of vessels involved (vessel score: vd). An ultrasound was performed for all patients and intensity of fatty liver involvement was graded from 0 (absence of steatosis) to 3 (severe steatosis). Results were interpreted using Chi-square test. A p value <0.05 was considered to be significant. Results 43.3% of the CAD patients had NAFLD on ultrasonography. Those patients who had CAD along with NAFLD had significantly higher body mass index (p<0.05). Moreover, coronary angiographic data indicated that the presence of NAFLD significantly correlated with the CAD severity score as so: 25% of people of SVD, 52% of people with 2vd and 73% of people with 3vd had fatty liver that was statistically significant (df=4; p<0.01). Conclusion This study showed a high prevalence of NAFLD in patients with documented CAD. More severe the CAD, higher the chances of NAFLD. Based on this small study we confer that all patients with NAFLD need screening for CAD with higher chances of CAD amongst severe fatty liver disease.",

Estate, Gandhinagar 382 424, India Acute viral hepatitis A or E in general is self-limited but in rare cases it may cause severe hemolysis, acute liver failure, renal failure and/or cholestasis. We report two cases of acute viral hepatitis A/E complicated by acute severe hemolysis. A 18-year-male presented with progressive jaundice since 7 days. Investigations revealed leukocytosis, very high total bilirubin-53 mg/dL, SGPT-5130 U/dL, PT-INR 1.42, high creatinine 3.64 mg/dL, high ammonia, IgM HAV reactive. Evaluation showed severe hemolysis (very high indirect billirubin, LDH, reticulocyte count). He was treated with intravenous N-acetyl cystein, steroids (IV methylprednisolone in tapering doses followed by oral), plasmapheresis (5 sessions), hemodialysis and multiple blood transfusions for severe hemolysis, acute liver and renal failure with anuria. There was complete resolution of jaundice, hemolysis after eight weeks of onset of illness. Renal failure resolved after three months. Second case-A 30 year male presented with progressive jaundice of 2 months duration with weight loss, breathlessness. Investigations revealed IgM HEV reactive, total billirubin 23.43mg/dL, hemoglobin 5.9g/dL and hemolysis (high retic count 5.2%, direct coomb test positive) with other causes of hemolysis like autoimmune, infections other than hepatitis A/E and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency ruled out. He was treated with oral steroids for HEV related immune mediated hemolytic anemia and blood transfusions. After 3 weeks of treatment there was no evidence of hemolysis and jaundice resolving. A prompt diagnosis and treatment of acute hepatitis A/E associated complications is essential, as uncommon presentation may delay diagnosis leading to permanent morbidity and high mortality in fulminant cases. We demonstrated rare cases of severe hemolysis related to hepatitis A/E in absence of other causes of hemolysis and efficacy of steroid, plasmapheresis in acute hemolysis and renal failure related to acute viral hepatitis.",

The aim was to study the outcome with early antiviral therapy (AVT) in CHB-AE. Methods The consecutive adult patients having CHB-AE seen in Out-Patient department or admitted at Department of Gastroenterology, G.I.P.M.E.R., Delhi were enrolled in study. The severity of CHB-AE was classified at first presentation on basis of total bilirubin and prolongation of prothrombin time as mild (Bil 2-5 mg/dL, PT <3 secs), moderate (Bil >5-15 mg/dL, PT <3 secs and severe (Bil >15 mg/dL or PT >3 secs or decompensation). The AVT was started in moderate and severe disease at the time of presentation and patients were followed up till 3 months or death. Results Total of 53 patients with confirmed CHB-AE and followed till end point were finally included in study. The mean age was 39.8\u00b114.4 yrs and 38 (72%) were males. In moderate CHB-AE group we had (n=21 (39.6%) patients, non-cirrhotic n=18, cirrhotic n=03) and median duration of symptoms was 25 days (21-28 days), S. Bil 9.3 mg/dL (7.9-10.9 mg/dL), ALT 1161 IU/mL (608-1395 IU/mL), S. Alb 3.9 gm/dL (3.6-4.4 gm/dL) and HBV DNA 33910 IU/mL (7916-1900000 IU/mL) respectively. Severe CHB-AE group had (n=29 (54.7%) patients, non-cirrhotic n=18, cirrhotic n=11) and median duration of symptoms was 28 days (21-42 days), S. Bil 19.32 mg/dL (15.4-23.1 mg/dL), ALT 1088 IU/mL (311-1440 IU/mL), S. Alb 3.5 gm/dL (3.1-4.2 gm/dL) and HBV DNA was 174931 IU/mL (7600 -66760 IU/mL). The AVT in mod CHB AE was (Entecavir n=14, Tenofovir n=7) and in severe CHB-AE was (Entecavir n=24, Tenofovir n=05). There were 4 (7.5%) deaths in CHB-AE, all death were in severe CHB-AE. Conclusion The initiation of AVT at time of presentation in symptomatic moderate and severe CHB-AE reduces mortality.",

We compared the clinical utility of these 2 tests to diagnose WD. Methods We retrospectively analyzed LDW Cu (by atomic absorption spectroscopy) and liver copper staining (rhodanine) in diagnosing hepatic WD. Semi-quantitative score was based on type of granules, zonal distribution and extent of staining (each scored 0-3; total score 0-9). Serum ceruloplasmin (ferroxidase) activity was assayed (normal >200 U/L). WD diagnostic scoring was based on EASL-WD guidelines (2012). Results Of 141 patients with LDW Cu available, 18 were diagnosed to have WD (M: 11; age: 23 years, 9-52; median, range). In these 18 patients, liver biopsy core weight was 0.84, 0.34-15.2 mg; LDW Cu: 306.3, 5.9-2365.6 \u03bcg/g; liver copper stain score: 4.5, 0-7. Nine of the 18 patients fulfilled EASL-WD diagnostic criteria (score \u22654; low serum ceruloplasmin:6, KF ring:7; 24 hr. urinary copper >50 \u03bcg: 18) prior to liver biopsy. Of these 9 patients, LDW Cu (225.03, 27.5-2365.6 \u03bcg/g) was raised in 7 patients (> 55 \u03bcg/g: 3; >250 \u03bcg/g: 4) and 5 showed Copper granules (Cu score: 4, 0-9). One patient had no copper on histology nor raised LDW Cu. Nine patients did not fulfil EASL-WD diagnostic criteria (i.e. score \u22654) prior to biopsy (score 3: 5 patients; score 2: 4 patients). Of these 9 patients, LDW copper (387.5, 5.9-1844.5 \u03bcg/g) was raised in 7 patients (> 55 \u03bcg/g: 2; > 250 \u03bcg/g: 5) and 6 showed Copper granules (Cu score: 5, 0-6). Only 1 patient (score: 3; probable WD) did not have copper on either histology or LDW.

Significant coagulopathy in these patients makes jugular venous access prone to bleeding; while femoral venous access may have higher risk of sepsis. Methods Prospectively collected database of liver failure patients who underwent PLEX between July 2016 to July 2018 was retrospectively analyzed. The choice of IV central access for PLEX was based on clinician's preference (i.e. either femoral / jugular). The IVaccess was secured with USG guidance, after adequate blood product transfusions. All patients underwent low volume PLEX (30-50 ml/kg/session). The number of sessions were decided on a case-to-case basis. The patients were monitored during and after PLEX sessions and complications were noted. Results Forty-five patients (M:27; age:29 (7-66) years; ALF-23; SAHF-8; ACLF-14) were included. Median 2 (1-10) PLEX sessions per patient were done. All patients had coagulopathy (PT:30.8 [11.9-120] seconds, and platelet count: 1.29 [0.15-6.94 ] lakhs/ cu.mm), prior to port insertion and required multiple units of blood product transfusion. Ten patients had jugular (ALF:1; SAHF:5 ACLF:4) and 35 had femoral (ALF:22; SAHF:3; ACLF:10) central IV access. Significant port-site bleeding was noted more commonly in jugular access (3/10 [30%]) as compared to femoral access (2/35 (6%); p-value:0.065). One patient in jugular access group required packed red cell transfusion and further PLEX sessions were discontinued in 2 patients (1 in each group) due to port site bleed. Blood stream infection (Gram negative bacilli), possibly secondary to port insertion was noted in one patient each from jugular and femoral access groups (p-value:0.4). Conclusions In liver failure patients undergoing PLEX, significant portsite bleeding was less common with femoral access as compared to jugular access; whereas the risk of blood stream infection was similar.",

Many other infectious agents have been implicated in causing neutropenia. Among hepatotropic viruses, hepatitis C has been reported to cause neutropenia. We present a case of isolated agranulocytosis caused by reactivation of hepatitis B. Case Report A 50-year-old woman presented with history of jaundice for 2 months and high-grade fever for 4 days. Physical examination was unremarkable except for icterus. On investigation, CBC showed Hb-11.8 gm/dL, TLC-1200cells/\u03bcl with absolute neutrophil count of 24 cells/\u03bcl, platelet count-2.9 lakhs/\u03bcl. Peripheral smear did not reveal any abnormal cell lines. LFT was SGOT-417 IU/L, SGPT-304 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase-115IU/L, GGT-51U/L, T. bilirubin-29.2 mg/dL, D. bilirubin-25.1mg/dL. USG-abdomen showed mild hepatomegaly with normal CBD and no IHBRD. Viral markers showed HBsAg was positive, serology for HAV, HEV, HCV, HIV were negative. HBeAg was negative, anti-HBc-total and IgM were both positive. HBV-DNA was 66420 IU/mL. Fever persisted for 10 days in spite of antibiotics. Blood and urine cultures were sterile twice. No evidence of infection by brucella, salmonella, rickettsia was found. Autoimmune profile (ANA, anti-dsDNA, Coomb's test) was negative. HRCT chest revealed B/L lower lobe atelectasis with no consolidation. Patient persisted to have severe neutropenia. Bone marrow biopsy showed normal erythroid and megakaryocte series with marked leucopenia and neutropenia. Patient was treated with supportive care (antibiotics, antifungals, nursed in isolated room) and Inj. G-CSF 300 \u03bcg subcutaneous was given for 5 days. Patient was also started on Tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg OD. Patient improved after 2 weeks, was afebrile and discharged with normal leukocyte count and improving LFT. On follow up 7 days after discharge her leukocyte count was 4800 cells/ \u03bcl. Conclusion Viral hepatitis B may be associated with isolated neutropenia as was found in this case. Hepatitis B infection should also be kept in mind in patients with neutropenia.",

We analyzed the hemodynamic effect and decompensation events of long-term continuation of simvastatin with carvedilol. Methods Non-variceal bleed cirrhotics were prospectively randomized to Carvedilol (Gp.A, n=110) or Carvedilol plus Simvastatin (Gr.B, n=110). Effect of drugs in HVPG reduction (reduction of \u226520% or< 12 mmHg) was measured at 3-months. High risk varices and HVPG non-responder patients underwent endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) at 3-months and the treatment was continued in others. Decompensation event was defined as new episode of variceal bleed, new onset hepatic encephalopathy, worsening of ascites and jaundice. Patients without decompensation events underwent repeat HVPG measurement at 1-year. Results Baseline parameters were comparable. Mean Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score in Gr. A was 7.29\u00b11.94 and in Gr. B was 7.66\u00b11.83 (p=0.28). Overall, 121 (55%) patients underwent HVPG at 3 months with 72 (59.5%) responders and 104 (85.9%) continued treatment for 1-year. Seventeen (14.1%) non-responders underwent primary EVL. The mean reduction in HVPG was significantly greater in Gr. B (n=24) than A (n=22) at 1-year, (-5.45 vs. -3 .00 mmHg, p=0.007). Total decompensation events at 1-year in the two groups were comparable (Gr. A=24.5% and Gr. B=21.6%, p=0.82). Patients who were responders at 3-months (n=72) showed lesser decompensations than non-responders (18.6% and 34.4%, p=0.068). The 6-month and 1-year complication free survival was 98% and 81% in responders and 71.9% and 65.2% in non-responders (p=0.003). On univariate analysis, age, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), CTP score and response at 3-months were significantly associated with decompensation events but on logistic regression analysis, baseline CTP score (CTP>8, sensitivity=70% and specificity=74%) was significantly associated with risk of decompensation in non-responders at 1year (OR-1.69, 95% CI-1.26-2.28, p=0.001). Conclusion Patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices and achieving HVPG response at 3 months show significantly decreased overall risk of hepatic decompensation at 1 year. Long-term simvastatin therapy helps in achieving greater degree of portal pressure reduction on longer treatment duration. Introduction Accidental exposure by needle stick and other injuries is a recognized source of exposure to blood borne pathogens like hepatitis B (HBV) hepatitis C (HCV) and human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) to health care workers (HCWs). Many of accidental injuries remain unreported thus prevent HCWs from receiving post exposure prophylaxis (PEP). The present observational study was aimed to know the incidence of needle prick and other exposures to HBV and HCV in HCWs. Methods This observational prospective study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital. A questionnaire was distributed to HCWs in various departments which included information on demographic data, accidental exposure to blood/blood products and other body fluids, needle prick, splash of infective material in the past one year. Immediate post exposure measures taken, serological testing, vaccination status and PEP received if any was noted. Results The study included 281 HCWs in the age group 20-56. Accidental exposure was reported in 69/281 (24%) including 24 doctors, 42 nursing staff (28 trainees) and 3 technicians. Commonest mode of accidental injury reported was contact with; blood in 35/69 (50.7%).This was followed by splash in 17 (24.6%), needle prick and sharp injury in 16 (23.1%) each. The incidence of accidental exposure was highest in young HCWs (82%). Use of protective devices at time of injury was noted in 32/69 (46.3%), cleaning the injury site with soap and disinfectant was frequently used first aid measure (66.6%) by HCWs. Most of the injuries occurred in surgical units, acute care; emergency areas. The accidental injury was reported to the concerned authorities only in 19%. HBV vaccination was recorded in 54/69 cases, anti Hbs status was known only in 7 cases. HBIG was administered in 6 cases. Conclusion 1) Accidental exposure to blood/blood products is common especially in young HCWs (75%). 2) The awareness of reporting to concerned authorities is very low. 3) Awareness and amp; education about preventive measures for HBV and amp; HCV is very low.",

There were 22 males and 30 females. Out of these, for 2 males and 2 females, Tenofovir was started for age being more than 40 years, and for one female it was started for a family history of hepatocellular carcinoma. For the remaining cases Tenofovir was started for those in immuneactive phase. The sensitivity of fibroscan compared to liver biopsy from previous studies were found to be 26% for F1(6KPA), 84.6% for F2, 96% (F3), and 86% for F4 and hence in this study fibroscan was used as a surrogate marker for fibrosis. Results There was no significant decrease in fibroscan values in patient before and after 6 months of treatment with tenofovir. Increase in fibroscan by 0.3 or more in 15 (p<0.01), 7 males and 8 females. However, the HBVDNA levels reduced in all with chronic B.

            "text": "Background Liver is a unique organ of the body due to its property of regenerating post-injury or partial hepatectomy. However, the mechanisms regulating this process are not clearly understood. Augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR) is a protein known to augment the process of liver regeneration. miRNA-26a was shown to modulate cell proliferation in several cells by targeting PTEN. Hence, we hypothesized that the positive regulation of cell proliferation by ALR might be through modulating miRNA-26a/PTEN pathway in hepatic cells. Methods Huh7 cells and HepG 2 cells were used for all the experiments. MiRNA-26a was overexpressed in these cells using siPORT NeoFX transfection reagent. After 72 hours of transfection, the cells were collected for protein or RNA analysis. The total cellular protein was used for Western blots for the detection of PTEN, GSK3b, b-catenin, Cyclin-D1, Akt, p-Akt. b-actin was used as an internal control in all the Western blot results. Real-time PCR was done to estimate miRNA-26a expression and it was normalized with 5S rRNA. Results Overexpression of ALR caused a 4-fold increase in miRNA-26a expression in Huh-7 cells and a 66% decrease in PTEN expression. This caused activation of proliferation pathway by up-regulation of cyclin D1 by 9-fold. miRNA-26a overexpression resulted in a decrease in the expression of PTEN (target protein for miRNA-26a) by 40% (n=3, p<0.05) but ALR expression was not altered significantly. Over expression of miRNA-26a resulted in an up-regulation of p-akt expression (2-fold over control) and decrease in GSK3b protein expression, resulting in an increase of both b-catenin and cyclin D1 (3-fold increase compared to control) protein levels.",

Serum 25(OH)D levels were inadequate in 78 out of 80 patients. Vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/ mL) was found in 60 patients and vitamin D insufficiency (20-30 ng/mL) found in 18 patients. Only 2 patients had adequate serum vitamin D levels (>30 ng/mL). Secondary hyperparathyroidism (serum PTH >65 pg/mL) was seen only in 5 patients. Patients with CTP score >9 had significantly lower serum 25(OH)D compared to CTP score <7 (10.33\u00b12.85 ng/mL vs. 19.02\u00b17.41ng/mL; p<0.001). Significant correlation was found between high Fibroscan value (>27 kpa) and lower serum 25(OH)D (<20 ng/mL) levels (p<0.001). Fibroscan was predictive of coagulopathy, hyperbilirubinimea, hypoalbunemia and high MELD score. Conclusion Lower vitamin D levels are very common in chronic liver disease and showed significant correlation with severity of CLD. Fibroscan correlated positively with severity of vitamin D deficiency.",

Although HBV is shown to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS), apoptosis was not induced in HBV-infected cells. Augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR) is known to induce hepatocyte survival. We hypothesized that HBV could inhibit apoptosis by increasing expression of ALR, which in turn might reduce intracellular ROS through a negative feedback regulation. Methods The intracellular ROS levels were measured in HepG2 and HepG2.2.1.5 (HepG2 cells expressing HBV) cells or in HepG2.2.1.5 cells transfected with ALR expression plasmid by fluorescence microscopy using H2DCFDA. Expression of Nrf-2 and ALR were determined using Western blots. For HBsAg ELISA, spent media was collected from ALR expressing HepG2.2.1.5 cells. ALR-plasmid or ALR-siRNA transfected HepG2.2.1.5 cells were used for Western blotting of Caspase-3. Results HepG2.2.1.5 cells showed significantly higher ROS levels compared to HepG2 cells (20% vs. 3%). There was an increase of 7.3-fold in Nrf-2 expression and 2.14-fold in ALR expression in HepG2.2.1.5 cells compared to HepG2 cells. Addition of H2O2 to HepG2.2.1.5 cells decreased cell survival by 11% and ROS scavenging by NAc caused 10% increase in cell survival. H2O2 treatment of HepG2.2.1.5 cells increased Nrf-2 expression by 8.62-fold and ALR expression by 7.42-fold. N-acetyl cysteine (NAc) treatment resulted in 37% reduction in Nrf-2 expression and 60% reduction in ALR expression in HepG2.2.1.5 cells. ALR caused 10% decrease in ROS in HepG2.2.1.5 cells. NAc treated cells showed only 5% ROS positive HepG2.2.1.5 cells. HBsAg levels were increased by 32% in HepG2.2.1.5 cells treated with ALR siRNA (p<0.05, n=3). ALR effected apoptosis by decreasing cleaved caspase-3 by 45% and increasing cell proliferation by 11%. Conclusion In this study we showed that HBV-induced ALR, at least in part, might be responsible for down regulating intracellular ROS levels, thereby inhibiting the cytotoxicity. This indirectly could help the HBV virus survival in hepatic cells.",

In India, the prevalence rate is estimated to be around 1%. The main reasons for delay in treatment in developed countries is high cost and long waitlist but situation is totally reverse in developing country like India where total cost of treatment is exceptionally low and there is no waiting list. Methods The oral antiviral drugs combination became available in India in December 2015. The Haryana government came up with Jeevan Rekha project and patients belonging to below poverty line and Schedule caste and tribes were treated free and General category patients were treated at highly subsidized rate of 80 Dollars for whole course. Thus, many patients came on treatment who were not able to afford treatment in past. Later on free treatment was started to everybody in Haryana. Total ten thousand patients have been treated under this project with oral antiviral as per scientific protocols. Results The Haryana government bears a burden of 80 Dollars/patient for whole course of treatment and tests for 12 weeks whereas in United States of America for 12 weeks treatment, cost is 84,000 Dollars. Up till now around ten thousand patients have been treated with SVR of more than 97%, mainly due to predominantly non-cirrhotic group, good compliance, less side effects, easy accessibility and affordability, no waiting list.",

Precise evaluation of renal function is crucial. Serum creatinine-widely used for assessment of renal function as it is easily accessible and inexpensive. But several reports have challenged the role of the assay in estimation of GFR especially in cirrhotic patients. Reference methods of estimation of GFR are not routinely feasible in clinical practice. Hence, several biomarkers have been evaluated for estimation of GFR in this population. Cystatin C is a cysteine protease inhibitor, unaffected by age, gender, race, muscle mass hence used as a biomarker for AKI. Aims To compare and correlate eGFR in patients with cirrhosis of liver using serum creatinine and serum cystatin C based on MDRD, CKD equations, in cirrhotic patients with normal serum creatinine. Methods Forty patients with diagnosed cirrhosis of liver with normal serum creatinine were included in the study. Patients with serum creatinine >1.2 mg/dl, sepsis, HCC, hypothyroidism, CKD were excluded. Measurement of serum creatinine (modified Jaffe) and serum cystatin C (nephelometry) was done. eGFR in all patients were calculated using MDRD formula and CKD EPI formula for eGFR (CKD EPI creat, CKD EPI cys C, CKD-EPI creat-cys C) were calculated. Results A total of 40 patients were included-male 90% and female 10%. The number of patients in CTP A, B and C were 7.5%, 40% and 52.5% respectively. Mean cystatin C was found to be high in 52% patients and in patients with CTP C cirrhosis (1.01+/-0.42). Mean eGFR using MDRD (98.7+/-44), using CKD EPI cystatin (96.3+/-47). AUROC analysis showed larger area under curve in the eGFR using CKD EPI cystatin C formula (1) as compared with eGFR using MDRD(0.56), EPI cystatin creatinine (0.93). Conclusion Cystatin C may be used as a biomarker for early detection of renal impairment in patients with cirrhosis of liver.",

Here we present a case of dysphagia due to hepatocellular carcinoma infiltrating the gastroesophageal (GE) junction. Case Report A 72-year-old male with presented with one month history of progressive dysphagia for solids and liquids, dull aching pain in the right hypochondrium and epigastrium with associated weight loss of 10 kgs in one month and loss of appetite. No significant past history. On General examination he was lethargic and cachectic (BMI: 17 Kg/ m2). Systemic examination of his abdomen revealed hard, irregular liver mass palpable 5 cms below the right costal margin, there was no splenomegaly or stigmata of chronic liver disease. Upper GI endoscopy done showing ulcerated friable growth at the level of GE junction for which biopsy was done. Contrast enhanced CT abdomen was done for staging of GE junction growth which interestingly showed two heterogeneously enhancing masses in arterial phase with wash out in venous and delayed phase one in the right lobe and other in the left lobe. His alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was 1,81,500 ng/mL. Patient followed up with GE junction growth biopsy report which showed pleomorphic hepatocytes with vesicular nucleus and prominent nucleoli suggestive of hepatocellular carcinoma. There was no involvement of portal vein. His Child-Pugh score is 5, performance status ECOG 3 and BCLC stage D.

We report improved survival with low volume plasma exchange (PLEX) in severe alcoholic hepatitis (AH) patients. Methods Severe AH (DF>32) patients who underwent PLEX during May-June 2018 (cases) and severity matched historic controls treated with standard medical therapy were recruited for this study. In addition to low-volume PLEX (performed daily or on alternate days with fresh frozen plasma as replacement), oral Prednisolone (20 mg/day tapered over 40 days), N-Acetylcysteine and zinc were used in cases. Plasma von-Willebrand factor (vWF) antigen levels (normal range: 50-150 U/dL) were assessed. Primary outcome studied was survival at discharge from hospital. Results Five cases (age: 37, 29-49 years; median, range) and 32 controls (age: 38, 30-63 years) were studied. All study patients had acute-on-chronic liver failure as per APASL criteria. Baseline DF, MELD score and plasma vWF levels were similar in cases (87.2, 42-430; 42, 23-53 and 785 U/dL, 300-1048 U/dL respectively) as in controls (72.5, 34-188; 29.5, 17-49 and 779 U/dL, 212-1347 U/dL). A median of 5 (1-8, range) PLEX sessions were done per case with 1.4 (1.4 -1.6) liters plasma exchanged in each session. No PLEX related serious complications were noted. Hospital stay in cases (18, 10-35 days) was longer than controls (6.5, 2-12 days). Composite poor in-patient outcome (death/ discharged in terminal state) was noted in 18 (56%) controls but in none of the cases (p value: 0.10). On medium term follow up, two PLEX patients died (49 and 66 days). Conclusion In this preliminary report, low volume PLEX along with low dose steroids appears to be safe and tends to improve short-term in-hospital outcome in severe alcoholic hepatitis.",

There are about 150 cases reported till date in the literature. We here report 65-yearold female with primary hepatic neuroendocrine tumor. Case Report A 65-year-old female admitted with complaints of abdominal pain and low-grade fever since one month. She had no history of jaundice, flushing, diarrhea or vomiting. She had a past medical history of appendectomy and hysterectomy done more than 20 years ago. On physical examination, she had hepatomegaly up to 10 cm below right coastal margin. On Laboratory investigation, liver enzymes slightly raised. Viral serology was negative. CECT abdomen was suggestive of hepatomegaly with multiple focal ill-defined iso-to hypo-dense lesions noted in both lobes of liver. Serum alfa-fetoprotein (2.53 ng/mL) and CEA (1.65 ng/mL) were normal. UGI Endoscopy showed features of portal hypertension with esophageal varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy. Colonoscopy done to look for primary source was normal. Liver biopsy revealed well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor. Serum chromogranin A levels were found to be high normal. Synaptophysin was found to be diffusely positive on IHC. Ki 67 index was 4% (intermediate grade). Other markers like CK-7, CK-20 and Hep-PAR-1 were all found negative. Ga68DOTATOC scan showed primary hepatic neuroendocrine tumor with gross hepatomegaly with multiple small hypodense lesions in both lobes. Despite that the liver represents the common site for metastases from other gastrointestinal neuroendocrine carcinomas or other tumors, primary hepatic neuroendocrine tumors are rare, but can occur. The diagnosis of PHNET is a medical challenge, as radiological appearances on ultrasound, CT scan and MRI can mimic other pathologies. We report a rare case of a PHNET in an adult female presenting with abdominal pain and hepatomegaly. therapy. Liver transplantation may be the only curative option as these patients are at higher risk of adverse effects. We report our experience of outcome of treatment of DAILD with steroids and azathioprine. Methods Patients with DAILD admitted in Sir Ganga Ram Hospital since January 2011 were enrolled. DAILD was diagnosed by simplified score for autoimmune liver diseases. Comprehensive serological markers and TJLB was done in all patients. Patients with HCC and those not consenting were excluded. All patients received prednisolone (30 mg/day tapered to 10 mg/ day) with or without azathioprine (50 mg/day). On follow up, response was defined as reduction in CTP score of 2 or more. Results A total of 24 patients (13 females), age 51.25 (21 -73 years) with median CTP score 9 (range,7-12) were included. After a median follow up of 31.5 months (5 -95 months), sixteen patients had response. Eleven patients improved from Child B to A, three from Child C to B and two from Child C to A at the last follow up. Fourteen patients had resolution of ascites and three had regression of varices. Five patients died of progressive liver failure, two were lost to follow up and one had incomplete response. Side effects of steroids (diabetes and sepsis) was seen in eight patients each, gastrointestinal ulcer bleed was seen in one. However, steroids could be restarted in all. Twenty patients received Azathioprine and eight had cytopenia requiring stoppage of drug. Conclusion There was a transplant free survival in 16/24 (66.6%) of patients over a median follow up of 31.5 months. Sepsis, diabetes and cytopenia are common however drugs could be restarted or modified in all patients.",

Methods Fifty cirrhotic patients from January 2017 -March 2018 were considered for the study after excluding known case of cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, renal disease or any major systemic disease. Severity of cirrhosis was evaluated by Child-Pugh score. All patients underwent echocardiogram and oxygen saturation documented by portable pulse oximetry in supine, sitting, standing position, pulmonary function tests done by spirometry and chest X-ray was taken.

The demographics, findings on general physical and systemic examination, anthropometric measures results of blood investigations done as part of donor work up, radiological investigations and liver biopsy findings were noted. Results Out of 124 study participants 73 (59%) were male and 51 (49%) were female. Mean age of participants was 31.71 years. Prevalence of fatty liver was 23% on USG abdomen, 31% On CT liver attenuation index (LAI), 49% on MRS. High BMI (>25 kg/m2), increased WC and WHR were significantly associated with presence of fatty liver. USG abdomen in comparison to CT LAI had sensitivity 55%, specificity 91%, PPV 72%, NPV 82% and accuracy of 80% in diagnosing fatty liver.

            "text": "Background The incidence of liver cirrhosis is significantly high in South Indian population. The rising incidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is likely partially responsible for these figures. Liver biopsy is not a practical diagnostic option in all patients suspected to have NAFLD. Hence validation of noninvasive markers of fibrosis is important in this population with a high prevalence of NAFLD. Aim To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of some NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) in South Indian population with NAFLD. Methods Biopsy-proven NAFLD patients were recruited from our tertiary care centre. Study period was from January 2016 to July 2018. NASH CRN fibrosis staging system was used to stage fibrosis. NAFLD fibrosis score was calculated using Age, BMI, IFG/DM, AST, ALT, platelet count, serum albumin. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for predicting advanced fibrosis using NFS were calculated. Results A total of 99 liver biopsies met the criteria for NAFLD during the study period. The mean age was 48.8 (21-83). 60.6% were males, 74.7% had a BMI>25, DM was seen in 50.5%. The severity of score was classified as none or mild fibrosis (stage 1, 2) 50.50% and advanced fibrosis (stage 3, 4) 49.5%. The high proportion of advanced fibrosis could be because of selection bias. A NFS score >0.676 had a diagnostic accuracy of 93.9% in detecting advanced fibrosis. Using NFS score >0.676 as a cut off we could avoid biopsy in 56.6% of NAFLD patients. Conclusion NAFLD fibrosis scores (NFS) can reliably diagnose advanced fibrosis in a high proportion of patients with NAFLD, allowing liver biopsy to be used in a more directed manner.",

            "text": "Introduction The initial experience with ABO incompatible (ABOi) orthotopic liver transplantations (OLTs) was dismal. In the current study, we investigated whether ABOi pediatric OLTs could achieve acceptable patient outcomes. The option for ABOi transplantation is vital because critically ill children have limited access to donor liver allografts. We present 3 cases of children less than 1 year who underwent ABOi liver transplant successfully at our center. Results Two male child and 1 female child underwent ABO incompatible LRLT in our center in last 6 months. At the time of operation average age of Child was 11 months, average weight was 7.3 kgs while average PELD was 15.5. Average GRWR was 4.2. First child had blood group O+ve and received B+ ve donor liver and had anti B titres of 1:2, second child had blood group O+ve and received donor liver from her mother who was A2+ve. She had anti-A titres of 1:256 while the third child was O+ve and received liver from A1+ve mother and had anti-A titres of 1:16. First two child had ICU stay of 4 day and were discharged on POD 20 in stable condition while third child had bowel perforation and underwent small bowel resection on POD9. He required re exploration and closure of two small perforation on POD 13 and was discharged in stable condition on POD 30. None of child required steroid pulse or immunoglobulins and are doing well till date. Conclusion ABOi LRLT seems to be safe without an escalation of immunosuppression and should be considered as an additional option to timely facilitate the transplantation. Background and Aims Tenofovir disoproxil fumerate (TDF) is the most potent drug for CHB. There is a lack of data on Tenofovir efficacy, compliance and response on fibrosis in Indian population. The aim of the study is to determine the response of tenofovir in progression of fibrosis assesed by Fibroscan. Method This is an institution based observational study, in a tertiary care hospital in Trivandrum, Kerala. Subjects who were started on Tenofovir for various indications, for at least 6 months in the past 2.5 years and whose pretreatment Fibroscan and relevant investigations are available were enrolled. Patients were called for repeat fibroscan and investigations. Compliance is assessed separately by interview with both patient and bystander. Results Total 52 patients were enrolled in the study. Ten patients (19.5%) were not properly compliant to tenofovir. Average duration of treatment was 1.4 years. Indications for treatment were persistently raised ALT in 46%, USG showing coarse liver in 29%, biopsy proven fibrosis in 10%. Viral load decreased in 42 (81%) while remained static or increased in 10 (19%). Lack of compliance increased the risk of increase in viral load by 11.66 times (p=0.001). The pre-treatment TE average was 12.2 when compared to post treatment average of 11.8 which was not statistically significant. TE value decreased in 27 while increased or remained same in Introduction and Background Sarcopenia (loss of muscle mass) is common in cirrhosis and is associated with poor outcomes. Prevalence, prognostic significance and diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia in cirrhotic population in Indian subcontinent is not established. Aim To estimate the prevalence, risk factors and prognostic significance for sarcopenia in patients with liver cirrhosis evaluated in a tertiary care centre in South India. Methods A cross sectional study conducted from January 2018 to July 2018. All adult cirrhotic patients who had a CT abdomen were included. Patients with extrahepatic malignancy, malabsorption syndromes, Coexisting tuberculosis and CKD stage 4 and 5 were excluded. Clinical, anthropometric and biochemical data was collected for all patients. Psoas muscle area (PMA) was measured at L3 level in a plain CT scan of abdomen and skeletal muscle index calculated. Result A total of 55 patients met the inclusion criteria. The male to female ratio was 47:8. The mean age distribution was 48.4 yrs (34-66). Sarcopenia was seen in 56.4% patients with liver cirrhosis. Prevalence of sarcopenia was similar in both sex groups. Serum albumin and serum creatinine was not statistically different in patient with and without sarcopenia. Prevalence of sarcopenia did not differ with CTP class (Child A-52.17%, Child B-64.7%, Child C-53.3%), MELD score (MELD <20-53.4% vs. MELD >20 -61.6%) or presence of HCC. Sarcopenia was more common in diabetic patients with cirrhosis (62.5% vs. 37.5%). There was also a significantly higher incidence of SBP in patients with cirrhosis and sarcopenia (16.1% vs. 8.3%). Conclusion In this single centre study, incidence of Sarcopenia in patients with liver cirrhosis was 56.4%. Presence of diabetes mellitus may be a cofactor for sarcopenia in liver cirrhosis. Incidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is increased in patients with liver cirrhosis and sarcopenia.",

Two patients had ALF related to rodenticide paste (yellow phosphorous) ingestion, 2 due to paracetamol poisoning, 1 related to HEV, 1 due to HEV in pregnancy with DILI, while 1 had ALF due to HAV. Median INR at presentation to our centre was 7.2. Median bilirubin was 13. Median ammonia was 109. All of them had normal serum creatinine. Median MELD score was 31. Median ICU stay was 4 days. Two patients had grade III encephalopathy and required mechanical ventilation for airway protection. Patient with HEV in pregnancy with DILI had spontaneous abortion during hospital course and required CVVHF. All patients received intravenous N-acetylcysteine, 100 mg/kg for 3 days, glutathione therapy for 5 days and Inj. Vitamin K. All patients received antibiotics according to antibiotic policy after sending surveillance cultures. None of them was given osmotic therapy and fresh frozen plasma for coagulopathy correction. Median hospital stay was 8 days. All patients were discharged in clinically stable condition. Conclusion ALF is associated with high mortality without liver transplant however can be managed conservatively without liver transplant in selected group of patient. Good prognostic indicator being MELD <33, arterial ammonia <124, normal serum creatinine, early hospitalization and initiation of antioxidant therapy. Osmotic therapy is not always necessary. coagulopathy should not be corrected with plasma unless there is any bleeding or need of invasive procedure. CVVHF can be used as bridge for recovery if needed.",

Aim of our study was to determine the efficacy of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) fibrosis score (NFS), aspartate transaminase to platelet ratio index (APRI) and fibrosis -4 (FIB4) vs. Fibroscan in assessing fibrosis in NAFLD Methods This is a single center study carried out in NAFLD patients attending a tertiary care center who were diagnosed using ultra sound abdomen showing fatty liver. Baseline parameters of liver function test, blood routine, anthropometry and Fibroscan were taken for these patients. APRI, FIB 4, NFS were calculated for these patients and area under the cure (AUC) were calculated. Result Of the 689 patients who were screened, the cut-off of significant fibrosis with Fibroscan was taken as 10 Kpa . Standard cut off for APRI, FIB-4, NFS score were taken. 2, 3.25, 0.676 respectively. AUC, sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value and negative predictive values for APRI, FIB 4 and NFS respectively were 0. 759, 0.11, 0.98, 0.74, 0.68 (APRI), 0.773, 0.92, 0.16, 0.35, 0.16, 0.98, 0.85, 0.70 (NFS) . Conclusion APRI and NFS score were found to be more specific while FIB 4 was found to be more specific in the study population in ruling in significant fibrosis. Introduction Liver diseases are the most common cause of mortality in the gastrointestinal wards and intensive care units. Clinicians are unable to identify the cause of liver disease in a proportion of such patients. We aim to look at the spectrum of liver diseases leading to mortality by analyzing the post-mortem liver biopsies. Methods The study was conducted at a tertiary care centre in North India. All the patients who were admitted with a diagnosis of liver disease which could be either cirrhosis, acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) or acute liver failure (ALF) and who succumbed to their illness underwent post-mortem liver biopsy. The liver biopsies were studied by two experienced pathologists for description and assignment of a possible etiology. All the post-mortem liver biopsies which were done during the period from January 2018 to June 2018 were included for this analysis. Results A total of 53 patients underwent liver biopsy during the study period. The diagnosis were as follows: ACLF in 12 (22.6%) patients, cholestatic disease in 8 (15.1%) patients, cirrhosis in 7 (13.2 %) patients, steatohepatitis in 6 (11.3 %) patients and sepsis related changes in 5 (9.4 %) patients. Three patients (5.7 %) each had ALF, granulomatous hepatitis, Budd-Chiari syndrome and tumor infiltration. Two patients (3.8 %) did not have any specific changes and 1 (1.9 %) patient had primary sclerosing cholangitis. Overall, a definite diagnosis could be made in 51 (96.2 %) patients out of the 53 who underwent liver biopsy. Conclusion Post-mortem liver biopsy could identify the diagnosis in the majority of patients who die due to liver disease. Background Severe alcoholic hepatitis (SAH), acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) grade III is a subset of patients with a very high short-term mortality. Pathophysiology of ACLF is dominated by severe systemic inflammation and aggravated hyperdynamic circulation originating from the gut and leading to multi organ dysfunction. Using a treatment approach that address major pathophysiologic derangements may improve survival. Aim To study the efficacy of slow infusion of furosemide, albumin with or without terlipressin (SIFA [T]) in patients with SAH, ACLF grade III and compare it with a similar cohort treated with standard medical therapy (SMT). Methods SAH (mDF >32), ACLF grade III according to EASL. Consecutive patients of severe SAH ACLF grade III received SIFA (T) (Arm I) using slow infusion of furosemide (2 mg/hour), albumin (2 gm/hour; 20-40 g/d; (SIFA) in addition to SMT for complications of ACLF. Furosemide was stepped up by 2 mg/h every 12 hours for 48 hours based on urinary sodium (UNa+) excretion. If UNa+ still remained <85 mmol/d, terlipressin infusion (SIFA [T] ) was started at 4mg/24 hrs, (max. up to 8 mg/24 hr).Treatment was continued till the patient was clinically dry and with UNa+ >85 mmol/L. Result Fifty-one patients with SAH ACLF grade III were included from July 2016 to July 2018. Twenty-seven received SIFA (T) and 24 received SMT (Arm II). Baseline parameters were similar. Significant improvement (p<0.05) was seen in urine sodium (27.6\u00b121 to 202\u00b1106 mmol/24hrs), and creatinine (2.3\u00b11. 67. vs. 1. 63.\u00b1 0. 9). after treatment in group I while there was no change in group II (serum creatinine [2.4 \u00b11.7 to 1. 99.\u00b11.7]; UO (525\u00b185 ml/day to 810\u00b1150 ml/d]). 28-day, 180 days, and 1 year survival in Arm I was 62%, 52%, 37% vs. 46%, 29%, (20% in Arm II (p<0.05). Conclusion SIFA (T) in severe alcoholic hepatitis ACLF grade III may improve survival.",

Methods Thirty patients with cirrhosis of liver irrespective of the CTP class were enrolled with controls (n=30). Subjects who were on drugs known to cause autonomic disturbance were excluded. For parasympathetic nervous system, heart rate variation with respiration (E/I), Valsalva ratio, lying standing ratio (L/S) and for sympathetic nervous system, blood pressure variation to standing/postural and sustained grip were documented. Results In our study the etiology of chronic liver disease was alcohol in 56.61 % patients, HBV in 3.33%, HCV in 23.33% and cryptogenic/NAFLD in 16.67%. There were 5 patients in CTP class A, 10 in CTP class B and 15 in CTP class C. Autonomic neuropathy (AN) was present in total of 22 out of 30 (73.33%) of the cases. CTP A had no evidence of AN. In CTP B 5 (50%) had early parasympathetic damage and 2 (20%) had definite parasympathetic damage. In CTP C, 4 (26.7%) patients had definite parasympathetic damage and 11 (73.3 %) had sympathetic damage. The mean E/I ratio, Valsalva ratio, L/S ratio were 1.17, 1.20 and 1.13 respectively in cirrhotic group irrespective of CTP class (p<0.001). Among parasympathetic tests heart rate response to deep breathing (E/I) ratio was the most frequent observed abnormal test (18, 60%) and among the sympathetic tests rise in BP to sustained grip was the most frequent observed abnormal test (14, 46.71%). Conclusion AN was present in total of 22 out of 30 (73.33%) of the cases. CTP A had no evidence of AN and AN was significantly related to the severity of CLD. Evidence-based treatment options for autonomic symptoms in CLD are lacking and further studies are needed to extrapolate data.",

PHES is an internationally accepted gold standard test for diagnosis of MHE. The sensitivity of PHES is 96% and specificity is almost 100% in the diagnosis of MHE but it is complex to perform. Methods We enrolled 100 patients of CLD with more than 12 years of education and enrolled them into both arms 1. PHES-fifty patients and 2. NCTs (A and B) -fifty patient. All patients with overt HE were excluded using West-Heaven Criteria. We calculated the PHES score by the online PHES calculator. The cut-off of 30 seconds was used for NCT A and 60 seconds for NCT B. We compared both groups to check the efficacy as compared to each other. Results Of the 100 patients 70 were males. Alcohol was the cause of cirrhosis in 80 patients; Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class C was present in 54 patients, class B in 46 patients. All 100 patients completed the tests. Out of 50 patients 16 patients showed MHE in PHES arm. In case of NCT-A and B arm 14 patients showed MHE positive result. All 16 patients showing MHE in PHES arm and all 14 patients from NCT arm were CTP class C. The p value was <0.05 so the hypothesis was true and there was no significant difference between the two arms. Conclusion Combination of NCT A and B in the diagnosis of MHE is comparable with PHES. NCT is simpler to perform and produces similar results as PHES.",

Lean NAFLD is defined as NAFLD with BMI less than 23. Our aims are: 1. To determine the frequency of lean NAFLD among NAFLD 2. To evaluate the clinical and metabolic profile of patients with lean NAFLD in comparison to overweight or obese NAFLD This is hospital based Cross sectional observational study. Results Total 90 patients recruited till now, among them 16 (18%) are lean, 8 (9%) are overweight and 66 (73%) obese. However, in all we could not get data, so we compared between lean (15) and overweight and obese (70) patients, both groups are similar in age group. Lean NAFLD have lesser degree of fasting insulin as compare to overweight and obese NAFLD, but not statistically significant, however TG level is significantly more in lean NAFLD as compare to overweight and obese NAFLD (p=0.0001). Metabolic syndrome is seen in 26 among overweight and obese NAFLD, where as in 2 among lean NAFLD. Insulin resistance is significantly more in overweight and obese group (p=0.01). Transaminases are significantly higher (p<0.01) in overweight and obese group as compared to lean NAFLD group. Conclusion Lean NAFLD is not a rare form of NAFLD, dyslipidemia is most common associated factor for lean NAFLD. Transaminases are significantly higher in overweight and obese group.",

            "text": "Introduction Renal dysfunctions amongst end stage liver disease (ESLD) patients is common with impact on outcome. If diagnosed early, outcome may be good in majority, There-fore we aimed to study the prevalence and causes of acute kidney injury (AKI) amongst all patients with ESLD requiring admission and its outcome. Methods All consecutive patients who presented at liver clinic from 1st October 2015 to 30th September 2016 with ESLD requiring admission formed the study group. All patients were evaluated for etiology of ESLD, presence of AKI and its causes. Treatment outcome was measured among AKI patients. Results Total 116 patients were recruited as per study protocol. Symptoms at presentation were abdominal distension 16 (44%), fever 10 (27%), abdominal pain 8 (22.2%), jaundice 9 (25%), decreased appetite 10 (27.7%), decreased urine output 13 (36.1), loose stools 9 (25%), GI bleed 4 (11.1%). Out of 116, 36 patients (31.03%) had AKI. Etiology of AKI was -HRS in 19 patients (52.7%%), prerenal failure in 6 patients (16.6%), sepsis in 10 patients (27%) and 1 patient had CKD. Of these 36 patients with AKI ,10 patients (27.7%) had CTP-B and 26 had (72.3%) CTP-C. Out of 36 patients with ESLD with AKI, 8 patients (22.2%) expired in hospital and additional 3 patients left against medical advice in view of poor prognosis suggesting an overall mortality of 30.5 %, while 25 patients were discharged. All 8 patients who expired in hospital had HRS. Overall out of 22 patients with HRS, 8 patients (36.36%) expired in same admission. Conclusion 1. Every third patient of ESLD requiring admission has AKI. 2. Among ESLD patients with AKI, HRS has worst prognosis with more than one third dying in same admission. 3. Sepsis remains the most important identifiable cause of AKI amongst ESLD. Background and Aims ABO-incompatible (ABOi) liver transplantation is usually contraindicated because of risk of antibody-mediated humoral rejection of graft. Ours is a busy living related liver transplant (LDLT) center. We describe 7 successful cases of patients who had LDLT from ABOi donors. Methods Study period-July 2010 to April 2018. ABOi LDLT patients <18 years age. Protocol consisted of rituximab 2 weeks prior (>3 years) and plasmapheresis before LDLT. Target anti-ABO titres pre-transplant was less than 1:16. Plasmapheresis to aim anti-ABO titers below 1:32 was planned up to 4 weeks post-op. Mycophenolate was started one week prior to transplant. No child was splenectomized and no local graft infusion used. Standard triple immune suppression (steroid, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus) was used postoperatively. Results Out of 200 Pediatric LDLT patients, 7 were ABO incompatible (ABOi). Indications-biliary atresia-4; PFIC-2, chronic rejection 1(retransplant). Median age 33 months (7-91); median PELD score 24 (19-42). Mean graft-to-recipient weight ratio 1.79. Initial range of isoagglutinin IgM and IgG titers were 1:32-1:256 and 1:64-1:256 respectively in 6 patients on whom median 4 (range 2-6) cycles of plasmapheresis done. One patient had titre 1:1024 where immune adsorption technique was used in view of 3 failed plasmapheresis along with Rituximab. Postoperative IVIG was used in 2 patients. No rejection, bacterial or fungal infections noted. Postoperative complications included portal vein thrombosis (one-successfully re-explored) and CMV infection (one). Mean hospital stay was 19 days (18-23 range). Patient and graft survival was 100% in recipients at a mean follow up of 24 months (range 1-59 months). Conclusions ABO-incompatible LDLT can be safely performed in children with excellent outcome. Preoperative reduction of antibody titres <1:32 by plasmapheresis is essential for successful LT. Immunoadsorption (glycosorb) technique is more effective than routine cascade plasmapheresis in patients with very high antibody titres.",

Predisposing factors was present in twenty (eight alcoholics and twelve diabetics) of them. Most of the patients (66.2%) had amoebic liver abscess. Solitary abscess (71.42%) and right lobe abscess (85.7%) were predominate in the analysed data. Indication of PCD was impending rupture (7.14%) rest were treatment refractory. Clinical recovery was seen in 1.28\u00b10.70 days (mean) and complete disappearance of liquefied content in 4.64\u00b12.03 days (mean). Procedure related complications were seen in 3 patients (two had external biliary fistula through abscess cavity and one had peritoneal contamination). Endoscopic biliary stenting was done in both the patients and peritoneal catheter drainage was done in third patient. Follow up data (ultrasound study at 1 month) showed residual abscess (<55.2 mL) in six patients (n=56) without any symptoms. Conclusion PCD is highly efficient and very safe procedure in patients with liver abscess which are either treatment refractory or with impending rupture. Background Liver transplantation (LT) is challenging in hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS). Preoperative pO2 <50 mmHg and MAA scan showing >20% shunting are believed to predict mortality post-LT. There is scarcity of data on LT in severe HPS with occasional reports of use of nitric oxide. Aim To study profile, impact and outcome of HPS in pediatric-LT. To study use of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) for refractory hypoxemia post-LT. Methods Retrospective analysis. Age <18 years. Study period: 2010-mid 2017. HPS severity graded by 2 methods: pO2 room air (mild: >80 mmHg, moderate: 60-80 mmHg, severe: 50-60 mmHg, very severe <50 mmHg) and CE-ECHO (some shunt: few bubbles, significant shunt: dense opacification). iNO used for refractory postoperative hypoxemia as per institutionally developed protocol. Results Twenty-three of 200 had HPS. Mean age: 6.5 years. By oxygenation criteria, 30.8 had severe/very severe HPS. By CE-ECHO 12(52.2%) had significant and 11(47.8%) had some shunt. MAA scan shunt-fraction was 21.1-73%. Patients with very severe HPS (n=6) had higher LOS (p=0.031) and duration of oxygen requirement (p=0.001) compared to rest HPS patients. Four of these 6 patients had-pO2 <45 mmHg: this appeared to-be predictor of stormy postoperative course. One-out-of these 4 died-on 7th postoperative-day due-to intracranial-hemorrhage (ICH). Remaining 3 had refractory postoperative hypoxemia, prolonged-LOS and hospital stay. iNO was used in all 3 cases successfully (mean duration of iNO:26.3days). Incidence of hepatic artery thrombosis in HPS-group was 17.3% compared to 3.1% in non-HPS group (3.1%; p=0.786). PV-thrombosis occurred in 1 (4.3%) in HPS group. ICH occurred in 2, both had pO2 <45 mmHg. One died on POD7 and other recovered with intact neurological outcome. One-year survival of HPS-group was 95.6% which was similar to non HPS group (94.4%, p=0.88). Conclusion Pediatric LT in HPS, especially if severe is challenging. This is the largest series of LT in HPS children published in literature. With good supportive care, outcomes of HPS and non-",

The present study was aimed to compare HRQOL in treatment failure versus treatment success cases post directly acting antivirals (DAA) therapy. Methods Four hundred and sixty recently diagnosed chronic hepatitis C patients without any evidence of cirrhosis who received DAAs for 12 weeks were analyzed retrospectively. HRQOL was measured using the SF-36 questionnaire before initiation and after completion of therapy. Patients were classified in treatment success (SVR achieved, n=400) and treatment failure (SVR not achieved, n= 60). Results Both groups had similar comparable HRQOL in all 8 domains measured by SF-36 questionnaire before initiation of therapy. Post-therapy, treatment failure group showed a significantly poor quality of life in all 8 domains. Conclusion Improvement in HRQOL in HCV cases is related to the treatment outcome. Elimination of virus as measured by SVR is associated with significant improvements in HRQOL.",

Efficacy and tolerability of Saroglitazar, a dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) \u03b1/\u03b3 agonist, is being analyzed for treatment of NAFLD in diabetic as well as non-diabetic subjects in this study. Methods This is a single centre, single arm, prospective, open label study of Saroglitazar. Obese patients having dyslipidemia with or without type 2 diabetes who had sonographic evidence (fibroscan) of NAFLD were enrolled. Patients with other concomitant liver disease were excluded from the study. All the patients received Saroglitazar 4 mg/day. Patients with diabetes were on standard oral antidiabetic therapy. The changes in laboratory parameters from baseline to 6 months follow up, were statistically evaluated. Results Ten Table 1 Comparison of HRQOL in treatment success vs treatment failure groupspatients with average age of 39.7 years with mean BMI of 28.8 kg/m2 were included in the study. In this study, 70% patients were male and 30% were female. Eighty percent of subjects were nondiabetic and 20% were diabetic. The baseline aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and triglycerides (TG) values were 81.5 IU/dL, 81.6 IU/dL and 343.3 mg/dL, respectively. There was no serious adverse event observed and Saroglitazar was well tolerated by all the patients. The mean reduction at 6 months follow up in the patients compared to baseline in the parameters like AST (50.31%), ALT (48.77%) and TG (59.71%) was highly significant (p<0.001). Conclusion Saroglitazar has shown promising results in both diabetic and non-diabetic NAFLD patients in terms of reduction in both liver enzymes and triglycerides at 6 months follow up in this study.",

Aim of the present study was to analyze the kidneys of pediatric patients with acute liver failure (ALF), acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) and chronic liver failure (CLF) for evidence of bile related injury and bile cast nephropathy. Methods In a retrospective medical autopsy study, morphological analysis of kidneys was done after taking informed consent from the first relatives. Renal tubules were looked for presence of bile cast nephropathy and tubulopathic changes without bile cast nephropathy. Assessment was also done for evidence for acute tubular necrosis and osmotic nephropathy. Results Of 14 patients (males 9, mean age 6.7 years [6 mo-16 years]) 3 had died of ALF, 8 ACLF and 3 CLF. Serum creatinine > 0.8 mg/dL was present in 3 (100%) patients with ALF, 2 (25%) with ACLF and none with CLF. Mean bilirubin was 23.2, 14 and 5 mg/dL in three groups of patients. Etiology of ALF was DILI in two and Wilson's disease in one patient. Chronic liver disease in ACLF were Indian childhood cirrhosis in 3 (37.5%), cryptogenic 2 (25%), and galactosemia, Wilson's disease and autoimmune hepatitis in one (12.5%) each. Acute insults in ACLF were infections in two (25%) and unknown in other patients. Etiology of cirrhosis in CLF was cryptogenic in 2 (66.6%) and Budd-Chiari syndrome in 1 (33.3%) patient. Renal morphology revealed bile staining of proximal renal tubular cells suggestive of tubulopathic changes without bile cast nephropathy in 4 (50%) patients with ACLF and 2 (66.6%) with ALF. Changes of osmotic nephropathy were present in 3 (100%) patients with ALF. Conclusion Bile cast nephropathy is not seen in pediatric patients with ALF, ACLF and CLF. Patients with ALF and ACLF show tubulopathic changes without bile cast nephropathy.",

ET usually occurs with bimodal peaks of between ages 50 and 70 yr and a separate peak among young females. A Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) enzyme mutation, JAK2V617F is present in about 50% of patients. The platelet count can be 1,000,000/mm 3 but may be as low as 450,000/mm 3 . Asymptomatic patients require no therapy. Aspirin is usually effective for microvascular events (ocular migraine, erythromelalgia and transient ischemic attacks). Some patients with extreme thrombocytosis require more aggressive treatment to control the platelet count; and such measures include hydroxyurea, anagrelide, interferon alfa-2b, or plateletpheresis. Case report The patient is 50-year-old female, who is a known case of extrahepatic portal vein obstruction (EHPVO) with bleeding fundal varices, spleenomegaly with hyperspleenism. As indicated she underwent spleenectomy with devascularization. Seven days after surgery her platelet count raised to 3,00,000/mmm 3 in routine investigations, followed by progressive increase up to 8 lacks after 1 month. Initially it was labelled as reactive thrombocytosis postsplenectomy. As the thrombocytosis persisted for 2 month and progressed further to 12 lacks, work up for myeloproliferative disorder is done with JAK2V617F mutation which is positive and bone marrow biopsy which has given the picture of essential thrombocythemia. Patient was treated with Asprin 75 mg once a day and Hydroxyurea 500 mg once a day for 4 weeks following which platelet count decreased to 5 lacks, then to 3 lacks after 6 weeks and then to 2.1 lacks after 8 weeks of treatment.

Methods Retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected data of post EVL ulcer bleed in a tertiary care liver disease center of India. The primary outcome being the five day survival and secondary outcome being six weeks survival. Results Over the study period (January 2014 to March 2017) 3854 sessions of EVL bands took place, 127 patients (3.3 %) presented with post EVL ulcer bleed (hematemesis or melena). We classified post EVL ulcers based on their endoscopic appearance into Type A-ulcer with active spurting, Type B-ulcer with ooze, Type C-ulcer base with visible vessel or clot and Type D-clean or pigmented base. There were 23 (18%), 33 (26%), 46 (36.2%) and 25 (19.8%) patients in Type A, Type B, Type C and Type D respectively. Forty-two patients died and the distribution was 17 (40.5%), 13 (31%), 8 (19%) and 4 (9.5%) in Type A, B, C and D respectively. On univariate analysis there was no correlation to HVPG, TIPS procedure, size of varices, number of bands applied. The MELD score and the esophageal mucosal appearance (neovascularisation and scarring) had a positive and negative correlation to the outcome. After adjusting for MELD the mortality was best predicted by type A ulcer with a p value of 0.024, OR (8.95) and CI (1.34-59.72) . Conclusions Post EVL ulcer bleeding incidence was 3.3% in our large cohort of patients who underwent EVL for esophageal varices. Stratifying these patients into various types based upon new classification helps in predicting outcomes independent of MELD score, but it requires further validation.",

MHE diagnosis requires specially designed psychometric tests and is associated with increased risk of developing overt HE and mortality. However, MHE is frequently missed during regular visits to OPD as majority of patients and their care takers do not recognise subtle symptoms. Hence we aimed this study to find out prevalence of MHE in patients who came to hospital for regular checkup and also to find out factors contributing to MHE. Methods Consecutive patients with liver cirrhosis between age group of 18-65 years presented to Liver Clinic from 1/11/2015 to 30/12/2016 and fulfilled inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled after obtaining informed consent. MHE was diagnosed by calculating PHES score (score of <-4 was considered as MHE). All patients with MHE were treated with rifaximine and lactulose. Patients were evaluated at end of 1 month for MHE and further followed up to 6 months for development of overt HE. Background and Aim There is limited data in cirrhotics on the correlation of altered portal, systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics and development, progression and severity of acute kidney injury (AKI) and the impact of hemodynamic response to beta-blockers (BB). Methods Consecutive cohort of cirrhotics (n=3493) without AKI, who underwent a hemodynamic assessment at baseline as part of clinical evaluation, were prospectively followed for the development/ resolution of AKI. Results Cirrhotics aged 50\u00b112 years, 79% male, mean hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) 15.6\u00b16.1 mmHg were followed for a median of 369 Conclusions High portal pressure, severe systemic and pulmonary vasodilatation, lower renal-reserve and severity of liver disease determine the risk of AKI development and mortality in cirrhosis. BB therapy, especially in responders, reduces degree of AKI and helps in its resolution. Stratifying patients with high portal pressure for additional pharmacologic intervention could enable prevention of AKI.",

            "text": "Introduction Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is third most common cause of cancer related deaths worldwide. Eighty percent of patients with HCC have chronic liver disease (CLD).Ten percent of deaths in patients with HCC are due to rupture. Transarterial embolization (TAE) and surgical resection serve as management options for ruptured HCC. Methodology Retrospective study of 14 patients from October 2014 to April 2018. Diagnosis of HCC rupture was based on symptoms coupled with findings of hemorrhagic ascites and CT abdominal angiogram. Patients suspected with HCC rupture were taken up for emergency TAE. Post embolization angiogram was done to confirm hemostasis. Patients were followed up over a period of 3month. Results Study included 14 male patients, of which 13 had CLD. One patient who didn't have CLD was HBsAg positive. Mean age was 64.8 yrs. Etiology of CLD was ETOH in 61.6% and NASH in 38.4%. Most patients were in CHILD B (71.4%). Average MELD score was 17.2. Number of patients in BCLC stage A, B, C and D were 21.4%, 42.8%, 35.7% and 0% respectively. Most common symptoms were pain abdomen (78.6%) and abdomen distension (71.4%). Two patients presented with shock. Fifty percent of patients had single lesion and rest had multiple lesion. Size of lesion was <3 cm in 35.7% of patients and >3cm in 64.2%. Most lesions were localized to right lobe (71.4%). 57.1% of lesions were of exophytic morphology. Mean ICU stay was 3.8 days after procedure. TAE with glue embolization was done in 11 (78.6%) patients, 3 (21.4%) patients underwent coiling. All patients achieved hemostasis. Thee months survival was 50%. Conclusions In our study most common presentations were pain abdomen and abdominal distension. Incidence of rupture was more in lesions greater than 3cm and confined to right lobe. Exophytic lesions were commonly associated with rupture. TAE is effective in achieving hemostasis with 3month survival of 50%.

The degree of oxidized cysteine (Cys) 34 in human serum albumin (HSA) is correlated with oxidative stress related to pathological conditions and modulates its physiological functions. We analyzed purified plasma albumin from 46 biopsy-proven NAFLD patients and 21 matched healthy blood donors. The albumin modifications were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ESI-TOF/MS). Relative % abundance of unmodified (intact) and modified isoforms of albumin were compared between NAFLD and controls. In-vitro ROS generation and antioxidant activity was measured by mean fluorescence (MFI) of Dihydrorhodamine (DHR) by flow cytometry in presence of purified albumin of controls and NALFD patients. Three most prominent isoforms of albumin were observed in the deconvoluted ESI spectrum with molecular masses of 66,438\u00b12.8, 66,559\u00b14.8 and 66,603\u00b16 Da in controls and NAFLD patients represents intact, cysteinylated and glycated isoforms of albumin respectively. Unmodified albumin was the predominant peak with 100% relative abundance in healthy with calculated theoretical mass (66, 438 Da, 542aa) . In contrast, the relative abundance of modified form with addition of +119Da (cysteinylation) of albumin was predominant (100%) in NAFLD. Cysteinylated isoform of albumin (cys-Alb) was significantly higher in NAFLD patients than controls (100% vs. 52% [p<0.01]). Circular dichroism (CD) spectrum showed clear structural alterations in purified albumin from NAFLD patients as compared to controls. Further, albumin antioxidant activity was measured by removal of ROS productions in-vitro. Significant differences were observed in mean fluorescence intensity of DHR in presence of purified albumin from controls and patients (51.5\u00b15.8% vs. 60.3 \u00b113.8%, p<0.001) showed reduced antioxidant activity of albumin in NAFLD patients. Our results clearly showed that sustained oxidative stress and reduced antioxidant activity is reflected by high levels of cysteinylated albumin in NAFLD patients.",

            "text": "Introduction Liver cirrhosis is associated with a wide range of cardiovascular abnormalities. The prevalence of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy remains unknown at present. Features include structural, histological, electrophysiological, systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Due to limited number of human studies, management of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy remains empirical and treatment is mainly supportive. The aim of this study was to study cardiac abnormalities in specific reference to corrected QT interval in Cirrhotic patients. Methods It is a prospective, observational study. Patients included were recruited from the Department of Medical Gastroenterology, Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute. Patients above 18 years with cirrhosis due to any etiology were enrolled from September 2016 to August 2018. Investigations included hemogram, LFT, RFT, serum electrolytes, prothrombin time, INR, ascitic fluid analysis, viral markers, electrocardiography and echocardiography. QTc interval >440 msec and E/A ratio less than 1 were considered diagnostic of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy. Patients were followed up to 6 months from date of presentation. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software. Univariate and multivariate analysis were done with Chi-square test or Fischer's exact test. P value of <0.05 was found to be significant. Results Child-Turcotte-Pugh score (CTP), ascites, patient outcome, MELD score and male gender significantly influenced cirrhotic cardiomyopathy, QTc interval and E/A ratio. Higher QTc interval significantly reduced the E/A ratio. Ejection fraction was less than 60% and presence of esophageal varices was seen with decrease in E/A ratio (p<0.05). Conclusion Severity of cirrhosis correlates with the presence of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy and is associated with poor outcome. Ascites, males, and elevated levels of serum bilirubin, serum albumin and INR are significant features in cases with cirrhotic cardiomyopathy. It is very important to examine heart to most of cirrhotic hepatic patients for early detection or any ECG changes. Background Diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis is based on combination of biochemical, immunological, and histological features. The presentation can be identical to many other causes of liver disease, hence they need to be excluded. We are presenting a case of a 57-year-old female who presented with fatigue and abdominal distension. An usual finding of hepatomegaly with liver span of 23 cm posed a diagnostic dilemma. A diagnois of autoimmune hepatitis in background of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was established and confirmed by the response to treatment. Introduction The patient had history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism and glomerulonephritis (biopsy not done due to solitary kidney) 10 year back. She presented with decreased appetite and fatigue of 2 months duration along with shortness of breath and abdominal distension. On evaluation, she was found to have pleural effusion and ascites, deranged liver functions and high titer of ANA and anti-dsDNA however, other markers associated with autoimmune hepatitis were negative. The viral markers and screen for hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease were negative. there was no radiological or biochemical evidence of tuberculosis. Liver biopsy demonstrated inflammation. Immunosuppressive therapy in the form of prednisolone and azathioprine was started resulting in normalization of liver function and improvement in symptoms. Conclusion The diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis coexisting with SLE was confirmed. The episode of glomerulonephritis occurred 10 year back was probably related to same disease and had resolved within a coarse of oral steroids only. This was important component of history since it prompted search for an autoimmune etiology which could be missed due to absence of typical features of lupus such as rash and polyarthralgia.",

This study was undertaken to address the microbiological profile and sensitivity patterns to guide the SBP treatment which is a growing concern with injudicious use of antibiotics. Methods This is a prospective observational study in which all cirrhotic patients with ascites admitted to the Department of Gastroenterology, Kurnool General Hospital, Andhra Pradesh from January 2017 to June 2018 were included. Ascitic fluid was collected aseptically at bed side for cell count in EDTA vacutainer and for culture in Bactec culture bottles. Antimicrobial sensitivity testing done in culture positive cases by disc diffusion method. Suspected cases of SBP were started on cefotaxime. Statistical analysis was done using Micro Soft excel. Results Out of 120 cases of ascitic fluid samples analyzed 38 cases (31.6%) were having SBP with PMN count >250 cells /mm3. Among these, 16 cases (42.1%) were culture positive. E. coli in 9 cases (56.2 %), klebsiella in 3 cases (18.7%), psudomonas in 2 cases (12.5 %) and proteus, Staphylococcus species in one case each (6.2%).

All cases were sensitive to carbapenams group of antibiotics. Six cases (15.7%) of SBP were asymptomatic at presentation. Conclusion About one third of cirrhotic patients with ascites were diagnosed to have SBP. There is a rising trend of resistant organisms to empirical antibiotic cefotaxime with one quarter of SBP patients requiring change of antibiotics. Hence routine ascitic fluid analysis for SBP including culture and sensitivity will guide further appropriate antibiotic therapy.",

Bile duct strictures can cause life threatening complications such as ascending cholangitis, liver abscess and septicemia. Early intervention can help the clinicians to treat accurately and thereby improving the quality of life and survival rate of these patients. Methods This retrospective study was done in RGGGH-MMC, Chennai through 2 years from May 2016 to May 2018. All patients with obstructive jaundice subjected to ERCP were included. Results Total number of patients were 256 patients. Male and female were 60% (153/256) and 40% (103/256) respectively. Out of 256 patients, malignant stricture was found in 72.6% (186/256) and benign strictures in 27.3% (70/256). Out of 186 malignant strictures, the most common malignancy was pancreatic cancer (27.95%), followed by Hilar cholangiocarcinoma (26.88%), distal cholangiocarcinoma (23.12%), gallbladder malignancy (13.97%) and ampullary malignancy (8.06%). One hundred and forty patients were non-operable and all underwent ERCP and biliary stenting with double pigtail plastic stent. Remaining 24.73% patients underwent definite surgical procedure with preoperative ERCP and biliary stenting. Out of 70 benign strictures, the most common cause was chronic calcific pancreatitis (54.5%), post cholecystectomy with iatrogenic bile duct injury (21.4%), choledocholithiasis (11.4%), EHPVO with portal biliopathy (8.5%), AIDS cholangiopathy (2.8%), primary sclerosing cholangitis (1.4%). All these patients underwent ERCP and Biliary stenting with double pigtail stent. Conclusion Obstructive jaundice was decreased in majority of patients who underwent palliative stenting. Few malignant stricture patients were in operable stage and were subjected to surgery. Remaining of them was put on self-expanding metallic biliary stenting. All benign stricture cases were managed with double pigtail plastic stenting which showed significant improvement in bilirubin levels. Early diagnosis and intervention is needed to provide definitive therapy in more number of patients there by improving the quality of life and survival rates in these patients.",

The aim of the study was to analyze the frequency of bile culture positivity, type of flora and its antibiotic sensitivity in biliary obstruction. Methods It was a retrospective record-based study between January 2016 and December 2017 including patients with biliary obstruction, who had their bile aspirated during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Demographic characteristics including age, gender, comorbidities, and details regarding indications for ERCP, presence of cholangitis, complete blood count, renal and liver function, bile culture and sensitivity were recorded. Results A total of 127 patients were included (mean age: 53.6+14.3 years with male preponderance [59%]). Malignancy accounted for about half of ERCP (56.7%). Bile culture was positive in 59 (46.5%) patients. Escherichia coli was the most common organism isolated in 38 (65.5%) followed by Klebsiella in 9 (15.5%) and enterobacter in five patients (8.6%). Other organisms grown in culture were: pseudomonas, enterococcus, staphylococcus, and acinetobacter. Acute cholangitis was noted in 67 patients (52.8%). Malignant biliary obstruction more often presented with cholangitis (59.7%) than benign causes (43.6%), the difference however did not attain statistical significance (p=0.0768). Bile culture positivity was observed frequently in those with cholangitis (68.7%) and was statistically significant (p<0.0001). However, such a difference was not observed in different etiologies of biliary obstruction. Most of the organisms were sensitive to amikacin (86.4%) or gentamycin (74.6%). Nearly-two third of them were resistant to ciprofloxacin (64.4%). Conclusion The frequency of bile culture positivity in biliary obstruction was 46.5%. Escherichia coli was the most common organism isolated. The etiology of biliary obstruction did neither influence the frequency nor the type of biliary colonization. Aminoglycosides would be a reasonable empirical antibiotic of choice in the setting of cholangitis in our region.",

The elimination of the anti-microbial barrier of Sphincter of Oddi and low pressure in common bile duct due to endoscopic sphincterotomy and endoprosthesis insertion leads to duodenal reflux, allowing bacterial colonization and biofilm formation, resulting in stent occlusion. Method This observational cross-sectional study, conducted from Jannuary 2017 to January 2018, included 50 patients who required stent removal.

We cultured the bile of 163 continuous ERCPs to compare the culture positivity of biliary obstructions. Methods We collected and analyzed the bile culture for patients undergoing ERCP at our center. The patients were categorized into benign and malignant subgroups based on their etiology of biliary obstruction. Bile culture was done using the bile collected during the ERCP keep aseptic precautions. Culture positivity was compared amongst patients of biliary and malignant obstruction on the basis of the spectrum of organisms and their antibiotics sensitivity. Results A total of 163 patients underwent ERCP during the study period. Benign obstruction was present in 115 patients (70.6%) and 48 patients (29.4%) had malignant obstruction. The common etiologies of obstruction were choledocholithiasis (n=70), post liver transplant anastomotic strictures (n=21) and carcinoma gallbladder (n=29). Bile culture was done during the ERCP keeping aseptic precautions. Of all the patients, 63.8% (n=104) had a positive biliary culture with mono and poly-microbial growth pattern noted in 77.9% and 22.1% respectively. Culture positivity was more common in the benign group as compared to the malignant group (69.6% vs. 50.0%: p= 0.02). The bacteriology of the bile was similar amongst the benign and malignant groups. E coli was the predominant bacteria in total, benign and malignant groups (65.4%, 67.5% and 58.3% respectively) followed by Klebsiella in the total and benign group (24.0% and 28.8%) and Enterococcus and Pseudomonas in the malignant group (12.5% each). Aciinetobacter was seen in a small percentage of cases. Conclusion Malignant biliary obstruction has a lesser incidence of growth and the bacterial spectrum was different. Although E coli was the commonest organism in both groups, Enterococcus and pseudomonas were common in the malignant subgroup which may have therapeutic implications. Patients who underwent ERC in operation theatre (OT) for gallstone diseases were included in the study. ERC was done in OT after completion of laparoscopic cholecystectomy mostly in supine position with the side viewing endoscope for cannulating the papilla. We evaluated indications, technical success and complications of intraoperative ERC. Results Fourteen patients were included in the study. The indications were necrotic GB with difficult stump closure (n=7), dilated CBD detected intraoperatively (n=3), two patients with CBD and GB stones chose to have laparoscopic cholecystectomy and ERC under single anaesthesia, and one each for Mirizzi syndrome and failed preoperative ERC. Technical success was achieved in 100%, with one patient requiring a rendezvous procedure. In all except one patient, ERCP was done in supine position. None of the patients had any complications. Conclusion IO-ERC has advantages of combining two procedures under a single anesthesia with good success rate and without increased rate of complications. In patients with gangrenous/necrotic GB, IO-ERC is an excellent approach to minimize postoperative morbidity. It may be best indicated as an alternative to surgical CBD exploration in those with failed preoperative ERC.",

Sixty-six patients had growth in bile culture, out of which 9 patients had dual growth (total of 75 microbial growths). The maximum growths amongst all microorganisms were of Escherichia coli (40.9%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (40.9%). With regard to bacterobilia, there was no significant difference between patients with cholangitis and without cholangitis (61.36% vs. 69.64%, p=0.288) , patients who had underwent previous ERCP with stenting and those who had not undergone the same previously (60% vs. 67%, p=0.301), patients who were empirically administered antibiotics before intervention and not administered (67.92% vs. 63.83%, p=0.599). Growth rates were significantly higher in patients with non-malignant causes of biliary obstruction versus those with malignant causes (70.76% vs. 57.14%, p=0.03). Polymixins had the highest sensitivity to cultured bacteria followed by aminoglycosides and Imipenem. Conclusion Gram negative bacteria like Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most common isolates from bile.

Introduction Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is frequently used for the treatment of hepatic, biliary tract, and pancreatic disorders and in the diagnosis of certain selected patients. However, failure during cannulation necessitates other interventions. Aims and Objectives The aim of this study was to establish parameters that can be used to predict failure during ERCP. Methods A total of 783 ERCP procedures performed on 722 patients, between January 2016 and May 2018, were retrospectively evaluated and analysed. Results Cannulation was possible in 68.4% patients. For each oneyear increase in age, the cannulation failure rate increased by 1.31fold (p=0.03). A history of previous hepatic biliary tract surgery caused the cannulation failure rate to increase by 0.67-fold (p<0.001). A tumor infiltrating the ampulla, malignant gastric outlet obstruction, and benign gastric outlet obstruction due to peptic ulcer disease increased the failure rate by 92 -, 48-, and 3.47-fold, respectively (p<0.001) Conclusion Patient gender and duodenal diverticula do not influence the success of cannulation during ERCP. Advanced age, benign or malignant obstruction of the gastrointestinal system, and duodenal ulcers decrease the cannulation success rate. Endoscopists who had at least 5 years of experience had better cannulation rates (statistically significant differences were detected among them). Methods During a period from July 2017 to July 2018, consecutive patients referred/presenting for ERCP in the department of gastroenterology, IMS, BHU were studied. A total of 236 patients were found to have HBS. Clinical examination and other relevant laboratory investigations were done and tumor markers were sought when required. The strictures and their nature were diagnosed on MRI/MRCP and CECT. ERCP aided in diagnosis albeit it was used primarily for therapeutic purposes. FNAC/Brush cytology were used as ancillary investigation (when indicated). Results Of the 236 patients, 114 (48.3%) were males and 122 (51.7%) were females. Mean age was 56\u00b18.5 years. The most common presentations were fatigability (100%), progressive jaundice (96%), pruritus (78%) and pain abdomen (57%). Malignancy accounted for majority of cases of HBS (n=182;77.1%) and benign biliary strictures (BBF) accounted for the remaining (n=54;22.9%). Carcinoma gallbladder (CaGB) was the most frequent cause of HBS (n=148; 62.7%), and of these 4.6% (n=11) were postcholecystectomy recurrences. Hilar cholangiocarcinoma accounted for 14.4% (n=34) cases. Postcholecystectomy strictures were the second most common cause of HBS (n=43; 18.2%). Hydatid cyst enucleation and splenectomy (involving the left hepatic duct) accounted for 2.5% (n=6) and 0.5% (n=1) cases respectively. Mirrizi's syndrome and dominant stricture in PSC involving left hepatic ducts were found in two patients (0.84%) each. Conclusions CaGB, post-surgical BBS and hilar cholangiocarcinoma remain the commoner cause of HBS. Rarely splenectomy may also complicate into HBS. Physicians need appraisal.",

All cases were done by a single operator. All cases where main pancreatic duct (MPD) could not be cannulated in three attempts, or MPD not cannulated directly in 10 minutes or common bile duct (CBD) cannulated first were studied. When direct MPD cannulation failed we attempted to cannulate the CBD first or when CBD was first cannulated during an MPD cannulation, we did a biliary sphincterotomy wide enough to separate the biliary and pancreatic orifices and then cannulated the MPD with a cannula and a glide wire. Pancreaticopleural fistula is a rare complication of acute, recurrent, and chronic pancreatitis. Pancreaticopleural fistula has been recognized as a clinical entity since case reports were published in late 1960s. Since that time, pancreaticopleural fistulae and pancreatic ascites have been termed as internal pancreatic fistulae which share common pathogenesis which includes the disruption of main pancreatic duct, resulting in leakage of pancreatic fluid. This rare entity may be seen in patients with acute and chronic pancreatitis or may follow traumatic and surgical disruption of the pancreatic duct. It is characterized by massive pleural effusion and has a tendency to recur following pleural tapping, ICD insertion in pleural space. While conservative management with pancreatic duct stenting and inhibition of pancreatic secretion with octreotide may achieve closure of fistula in most cases.

Introduction Pancreatic pseudocysts are fluid collections in the pancreatic tissue or adjacent pancreatic space. Surgery is favored, however; less invasive methods like endotherapy and radiological interventions have comparable success rates. Methods Patients diagnosed with pancreatic pseudocyst of duration more than 4 weeks between January 2016 and June 2018 based on the revised Atlanta Classification were included in the study. Of the total of 115 cases (male 92 and female 23), 42% underwent endotherapy, 19% underwent surgery and 36% were treated by radiological interventions. The main symptoms for which pseudocyst was drained include persisting abdominal pain (72%), jaundice (22%) and intestinal obstruction (6%). In endoscopic therapy, PD stenting was done in 77% of patients. In 23% of patients, stenting could not be done due to failed PD cannulation. Results Fifty percent patients had pseudocysts in HOP, 14% in tail of pancreas, 8% in body and tail, and 19% in body of pancreas. Of the cases treated by endoscopic approach, 61% were pseudocyst associated with chronic pancreatitis, 11% acute pancreatitis, 5% blunt trauma, 9% RAP and 5% pancreas divisum cases. With surgical approach, 80% were chronic pancreatitis, 12% acute pancreatitis and 8% due to blunt trauma. In radiological interventions, 64% were infected pancreatic pseudocysts and 35% were large symptomatic pseudocysts. Eighty-four percent of surgical cases underwent cystogastrostomy, 4% cystoduodenostomy and 12% distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy. Symptom improvement with endoscopy was comparable with surgical interventions and least with radiological drainage. The complication rate and mean hospital stay were least with endoscopic drainage. Surgery required the least reintervention Conclusion Only symptomatic pseudocyst needs to be treated. Endoscopic approach is less invasive and associated with less hospital stay and complications. Radiological drainage is especially useful in Introduction Serum amylase and lipase estimations are standard tests to diagnose acute pancreatitis (AP). However, there are rare conditions which may lead to significant elevation of these two parameters. We here report a case of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with hyperamylasemia and lipasemia without AP. Case report A 18-years-old girl was hospitalized with pain abdomen, vomiting and loose stools of one day duration. She had persistent mild diffuse abdominal pain without any radiation, aggravating or relieving factors. She had several bouts of vomiting bringing out food particles without any blood. On examination at the time of admission, she was hemodynamically stable. Per abdominal examination revealed mild epigastric guarding. Investigations revealed neutrophlic leukocytosis 800/cmm, N 93%) . Urine examination revealed glycosuria, ketonuria (++++). Random blood glucose was 723 mg/dL, HbA1c 5.8%. Her ABG at the time of admission revealed pH 7.1 and serum bicarbonate was 8.9 mmol/L. CRP was 22 mg/L. USS abdomen. Serum amylase was 401 U/L, lipase was 413 U/L. Repeat serum amylase and lipase next day was 283mg/dL and 946 mg/dL respectively. A CECT abdomen revealed a normal pancreas. Discussion Serum amylase and lipase are used for diagnosis of AP. Other causes of hyperamylasemia and lipasemia are rare. The source of elevated enzymes in DKAwithout AP remains unclear. Search for alternative causes of hyperlipasemia is essential because such levels may be erroneously interpreted as indicative of AP. In conclusion, significant but nonspecific elevations of amylase and lipase can be seen in DKA. Hence, when DKA is diagnosed, raised amylase/lipase should not be assumed to be due to the DKA only and imaging studies for AP should be undertaken.",

Pain was most common symptom present in 23 patients (88.46%). Diabetes was present in 7 patients (27%) as compared to 15% in alcoholic chronic pancreatitis. Exocrine pancreatic dysfunction was uncommon, steatorrhea being present in only 3 patients (11%). Hyperparathyroidism and hypertriglyceridemia were found in 1 patient each. Pancreas divisum was found in 2 patients and annular pancreas in 1 patient. Pancreatic calcification was most common radiological finding noted in 65% (n=17) of patients. Atrophy, dilated PD, PD calculi and pseudocyst was noted in 58%, 61%, 23% and 23 % respectively. Conclusion Non-alcoholic chronic pancreatitis occurs with approximately equal frequency in both sexes, occurring at younger age than alcoholic. Steatorrhea is uncommon. Diabetes is more common as compared to alcoholic chronic pancreatitis. Calcification, atrophy and dilated PD are common radiological findings.",

We evaluated the association between success of PCD drainage (i.e. survival without necrosectomy) and various factors. Baseline parameters (demography, CTSI, aetiology, % necrosis, APACHE II, CRP and IAP, morphologic characteristics on computed tomography), characteristics of collection before PCD (nature of collection, volume, site, solid component), PCD parameters (initial size, maximum size, number and duration of drainage) and factors after PCD insertion (fall in CRP, fall in IAP, reduction in volume of collection). Results Out of 101 patients of AP, 51patients required PCD drainage. The success rate of PCD in our study was 66.66 % (34/51) and 4 patients required additional surgical necrosectomy after PCD. Overall mortality rate in our study was 29.4 % (15/51, including 2 deaths after necrosectomy). PCD alone improved organ failure in 72.54% patients. Of all the parameters evaluated, initial PCD size (p=0.011) and >50% volume reduction in collection after PCD insertion (p=0.000) were positive predictors of PCD success. Total volume of collection more than 750 CC before PCD was probably a negative predictor of PCD outcome (p=0.05). Conclusion Larger size of the first PCD and more than 50% reduction of collection after PCD were positive predictors of PCD success. Total volume of collection more than 750 CC before PCD is probably a negative predictor of PCD outcome. Background Intravenous fluid resuscitation plays a critical role in the management of early acute pancreatitis. Central venous pressure (CVP) measurement as a guide to estimation of intravascular volume is the standard of care however, point of care ultrasound (POCUS) is an emerging non-invasive alternative for intravascular volume estimation. Inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter, collapsibility index (CI) in spontaneously breathing patients and distensibilty index (DI) in mechanically ventilated patients of acute pancreatitis can be measured along with the CVP and mean arterial pressure (MAP) in order to guide fluid therapy. We aim to determine if CVP correlated with distensibility index of IVC in mechanically ventilated patients and collapsibility index in spontaneously breathing patients undergoing POCUS guided fluid resuscitation. Methods Prospective observational study comprising of 33 patient's acute pancreatitis were evaluated between January 2016 to September 2017 and POCUS directed fluid resuscitation was carried out with regular monitoring of IVC parameters, CVP, MAP and various clinical and biochemical parameters on a 6th hourly basis. Results After adequate POCUS directed fluid resuscitation there was a significant increase in CVP (p=0.0002) and MAP (p=0.0004) in spontaneously breathing patients and MAP (p= 0.0001) and CVP (p=0.0118) in mechanically ventilated patients. There was a negative correlation between CI, MAP, CVP (R= -0.8, p=0.04) in spontaneously breathing patients, however there was no correlation between DI, MAP, and CVP in mechanically ventilated patients (R= -0.252, p=0.06). Conclusion Collapsibility index and IVC diameters are novel noninvasive methods to guide fluid therapy in spontaneously breathing patients of acute pancreatitis, however in mechanically ventilated patients CVP and distensibility indices and IVC diameter showed no correlation, making it unreliable as an accurate marker of intravascular fluid status in mechanically ventilated patients of acute pancreatitis.",

The pathophysiology of hypercalcemia-induced acute pancreatitis is not well known, but when this combination occurs, pancreatitis is likely to be severe and the degree of hypercalcemia may play an important role in this association. Therefore, the cause of hypercalcemia should be identified early. Surgical resection of the parathyroid adenoma is the ultimate therapy. Case Report We report two cases of acute pancreatitis caused by hypercalcemia due to pHPT that was not known previously. The cause of hyperparathyroidism was a benign parathyroid adenoma. We highlight the drawbacks in delaying the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism in patients with acute pancreatitis as the sole clinical presentation. Conclusion The role of primary hyperparathyroidism as a causative factor is underestimated when managing patients with acute pancreatitis, and frequently the underlying disease remains undiagnosed for a long time.

Advances in flow cytometry have provided opportunities for identifying such patients earlier. Hence this study was planned to evaluate the role of mHLA DR, nCD64 , severity index (SI) as an early marker for severe acute pancreatitis and sepsis and compare with existing markers Methods A total of 52 consecutive patients of acute pancreatitis were enrolled. All patients were subjected to investigations as per the study protocol like CBC, CT abdomen, serum procalcitonin, CRP. Severity index on Day 1 and CT severity index (CTSI) was calculated on day 4 of presentation. Determination of cell surface markers was done using flow cytometry for monocytic HLA-DR and neutrophillic CD64. Severity index was calculated as =MFI of nCD64 x 100, MFI of mHLA-DR, All patients were followed up for 30 days to assess the disease course. Results Out of 52 patients 15 patients (28.8%) had sepsis over the follow up period. Out of these, 4 patients expired. Age, mHLA DR and severty index significantly associated with early assessment of sepsis while procalcitonin, CTSI, nCD64 did not predict sepsis.

Methods Patients of acute pancreatitis admitted to the department of gastroenterology of our institute were included. We compared the severity of AP by revised Atlanta classification in, local complications, severity scores, computed tomography severity index (CTSI), radiographic, and laboratory data between alcoholic and biliary AP. We also evaluated the length of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality in each group. Results Out of 53 patients of acute pancreatitis 23 were alcoholic and 30 had gallstones. In laboratory parameter ALT levels were significantly (p<0.001) higher in biliary (245.2 \u00b1202.6) cause than alcoholic (105.6 \u00b199.4) while CRP levels were significantly high in alcoholics then biliary. Incidence of pseudocyst formation was significantly higher in the alcoholic than in the biliary. Among prognostic scoring systems, only CTSI showed significant difference (p<0.001). Severe AP with organ failure persisting beyond 48 h was observed in 4 patients (17.3%) in the alcohol group and one patient (3.3 %) in the biliary group (p=0.04).

The incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) ranges from 1% to 10% for low-risk individuals to 25% to 30% without prophylaxis for individuals with high-risk factors. The use of an infusion of Ringer's lactate (RL) has shown a benefit in the prevention of acute pancreatitis. In this study we compared effect of rectal diclofenac suppository, RL and combination of both in prevention of PEP. Aims To study the effect of intravenous ringer lactate or Diclofenac suppository to decrease incidence of PEP. To assess effectiveness of combination of both modalities to decrease incidence of PEP. Methods Patient fulfilling major high risk criteria (past history of PEP). Pancreatic sphincterotomy, pre-cut sphincterotomy, difficult cannulation (>8 attempts or >10 min for cannulation), sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, pneumatic dilatation of intact sphincter). Minor high risk criteria (female with age <50 years, normal bilirubin levels, dye injection in pancrease, pancretic brush cytology, >3 times PD cannulation) for PEP during ERCP was given either RL (1 Litre) or diclofenac (100 mg) suppository or combination of both (RL+ Diclofenac) immediate post procedure. Prophylaxis allotment was done with computer generated random number table. Patients were observed for next 24 hours for development of post ERCP pancreatitis. Results Out of 60 patients enrolled in study (20 per group), all patients had at least 1 high risk criterion for PEP, and 56% had >1. PEP occurred in 2 patients (10%) in RL+ Diclofenac group, 2 patients (10%) in diclofenac group and 3 (15%) patients in RL group. No statistical difference was found between 3 groups.

(Hazard ratio-69, CI 95% 6.9-702 Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) refers to unique forms of steroidresponsive chronic pancreatitis with two subtypes as described in adults. It is a rare, newly recognized disease and there are only few reports of pediatric patients. A 5-year-old boy presented with 2 months history of epigastric abdominal pain, fever and weight loss. Blood analysis revealed bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 163 U/L (normal 5-40 U/L), alanine aminotransferase 80 U/L (normal 5-45 U/L), with amylase 120 U/L (normal 20-100 U/L). Other fever work up including malarial smears was negative and blood culture sterile. Serum IgG4 was normal at 1.12 g/L (normal 0.013-1.446 g/L). On imaging, USG revealed presence of large ill defined mass of 41 x 38.4 mm involving pancreatic head, no internal vascularity, and dilated pancreatic duct measuring 2.8 mm. MR abdomen revealed an ill-defined T2 heterogeneously hyperintense mass (43 x 43 x 43 mm) showing heterogeneous enhancement and diffusion restriction, arising from head and uncinate process of pancreas causing intrahepatic biliary radical, common biliary and pancreatic duct dilatation. To rule out malignancy an USG guided biopsy from mass was done which demonstrated extensive fibrosis with moderate to dense inflammation with few plasma cells. However, storiform pattern of arrangement and phlebitis was not seen and stain for IgG4 was negative. He was started on oral prednisolone at 2 mg/kg given for 2 weeks followed by tapering doses, and repeat MR scan after 4 weeks revealed more than 50 percent reduction in size of mass. On 3 months follow up he is on 5 mg prednisolone and 50 mg azathioprine and is asymptomatic. Introduction Pancreatitis is a common disease with wide clinical variation and its incidence is increasing. The present study was aimed to assess the etiology clinical profile and their treatment outcome of pancreatitis. Methods Consecutive patients attending the hospital during last 1 year with diagnosis of pancreatitis as per clinical, biochemical and radiologic criteria were included in the study. Result The total numbers of patient were 113 with M: F, 4:1.The mean age of the study population was 48.01\u00b113.17. Majority were in age group of 30-50 years. Out of the total 39% were acute 11% were recurrent acute and 50% were chronic pancreatitis. Of acute pancreatitis (21/44) 47.72% were biliary, (17/44) 38.63% were alcoholic (2/44) 4.5% had hypertriglyceredemia, (3/44) 6.87% were groove pancreatitis and (1/44) 2.2% were post ERCP pancreatitis. Ten patients of acute pancreatitis (22.72%) had severe acute pancreatitis with CT severity index of 8 to 10, of them 9% had AKI, 16% had pseudocyst,11% had ascites, needs ICU admission. Two patients need debridement, 1 patient died and rest recovered. Out of 56 chronic pancreatitis (22/56) 39.2% were alcoholic, (30/56) 53.57% were idiopathic. Of them 24/56 (42.85%) had endocrine, 7/56 (12.5%) had exocrine dysfunction 5/56 (8.9%) had mesenteric vein thrombosis and (4/56) 7.14% had pancreatic malignancy. Patients with acute pancreatitis mostly managed conservatively, ERCP done in (12/ 17) of biliary pancreatitis, 2 patients need surgical debridement 1 need endoscopic debridement, one patient died. Patients with chronic pancreatitis also managed conservatively except 10 patients who need ERCP for obstructive jaundice. Three patients need surgery for chronic pain. Conclusion The incidence of pancreatitis increasing in our part. Alcohol being the most common etiology followed by idiopathic and biliary in the present study. Majority of patients improved conservatively, and few needs endoscopic and surgical intervention. Objectives To evaluate the frequency, age, gender, etiology, mortality and morbidity of patients suffering from acute pancreatitis (AP) and management issues in a tertiary referral centre. Methods Data analysis of patients with diagnosis of acute pancreatitis admitted to the tertiary care centre in the KIMS hospital, Telangana between March 2017 and April 2018. Results Total 204 patients enrolled in this study: Male 143 (70%) and female 61 (30%). Majority of male (47.5%) in the age group of 40-60 years and females (49.2%) are >60 years. Most common etiology alcohol (45%) followed by gallstones disease (30%). Total patients of acute severe pancreatitis 74 (36.27%) and death 11. Overall total death 18/204. In severe pancreatitis 22 cases had very high CRP (>25).17 severe pancreatitis developed pseudocyst and 4 require percutaneous drainage, 4 require surgery and 3 require EUS guided cystogastrostomy. Majority of patients received antibiotics during their stay in ICU empirically or for confirmed infections. 43/204 of AP develop AKI and 33 are moderate to severe pancreatitis. AKI and ARDS most commonly encountered complications. On admission to ICU of severe cases, the median APACHE II score 17, the pancreatitis outcome prediction (POP) score 8, and the median CTSI 5. Median lengths of stay in ICU of severe pancreatitis were 12 days. Only 3 out of 74 patients of severe pancreatitis require NJ feed and rest manage with enteral feeding. Conclusion Acute pancreatitis occurred more in males than females. Alcoholic pancreatitis more common in males, whereas biliary pancreatitis more common in females. APACHE II and POP score are useful prognostic scoring system for predicting the severity of AP within first 24 hours. We observed that improved outcomes when enteral nutrition was started within 48 h in severe pancreatitis. Organ failure more in 1st week and local complications of necrosis and pancreatic fluid collections, including infection more common in the late phase. Mortality and morbidity in this study was low in comparison to other studies. Introduction Common predisposing factors for acute pancreatitis (AP) include alcohol, gallstones, ERCP, drugs and trauma. Metabolic causes of AP like hypercalcemia, hypertriglyceridemia and diabetes mellitus are infrequent. Methods We present our experience of acute pancreatitis cases admitted in the Gastroenterology department over one year (August, 2017 to July, 2018) at a tertiary care hospital in Delhi NCR and report few unusual causes of pancreatitis which were observed. Results A total of 77 cases of AP were admitted comprising 6.5% of total admissions (1173) in the Gastroenterology Department. Alcohol was the most common etiology (28.5%) followed by gallstones (27.2%), idiopathic (27.2%) and ERCP (5%). Other causes included pancreas divisum in 3 patients, hypercalcemia due to primary hyperparathyroidism in 2 patients, drug induced in 2 patients (ACE inhibitor, DPP-4 inhibitor), hypertriglyceridemia, trauma and viral infection in one patient each. Two female patients with primary hyperparathyroidism presented with severe hypercalcemia resulting in AP. Hypercalcemia in both patients was managed initially with bisphosphonates, saline diuresis and calcitonin injections. One patient had severe necrotizing pancreatitis and had Zolendronic acid/pancreatitis induced severe hypocalcemia leading to cardiac arrest. She had a stormy course during hospitalization wherein she was resuscitated after cardiac arrest and had prolonged stay in hospital due to sepsis and hypoxic brain injury. The second patient had Mild AP with Acute on CKD. Both patients subsequently underwent parathyroidectomy before discharge. A 25-year-old male patient with family history of hypertriglyceridemia presented with mild AP and was found to have increased triglycerides (3917 mg/dL). He was managed conservatively, and fibrates were started. Conclusion Apart from typical causes like alcohol and gallstones, metabolic causes should be looked for in cases of acute pancreatitis. Metabolic causes may lead to recurrent acute pancreatitis unless there is prompt identification and definitive treatment of underlying cause.",

            "text": "Seria lung ultrasound in the assessment of volume status and disease severity in acute pancreatitis Introduction Pressure-based parameters like central venous pressure have shortcomings for assessing volume status in acute pancreatitis (AP). Transthoracic lung ultrasonography (LUS) has been reported as a noninvasive method for diagnosing alveolar-interstitial syndrome (AIS) in critically ill patients. There is insufficient data on role of LUS in AP. Objective To prospectively study the serial LUS findings in AP, and correlate them with the amount of intravenous fluid administered and the clinical outcomes. Methods Adult patients of predicted severe AP who presented within 5 days of pain onset from January 2016 to June 2017 underwent LUS at baseline (LUS1), 24 hours (LUS2) and 48 hours (LUS3). Number of Blines in anterolateral chest was recorded. B-line score was calculated forall quadrants (BLS1), all quadrants except lower lateral quadrants (BLS2) and only upper quadrants (BLS3). % change in BLS from LUS1-2 (Delta1-BLS) and LUS1-3 (Delta2-BLS) were calculated. They were followed up till clinical recovery or death. Results 17/78 eligible patients (11 male, age-mean 36\u00b114 years, range 18-68) underwent LUS. The etiology of AP was: alcohol (n=7), gallstones (n=6) and others (n=4). All had acute lung injury at presentation. Eight patients required radiological \u00b1 surgical intervention. Five patients expired. Mean BLS1 on LUS1-3 was 2.8\u00b12.8, 1.8\u00b12.4 and 1.7\u00b12.5, respectively. Patients with moderate lung injury (vs. mild lung injury) had numerically higher but insignificant BLS on LUS1 (BLS1, BLS2, and BLS3-3.8\u00b14.0, 3.6\u00b14.1 and 2.1\u00b11.3 vs. 2.1\u00b11.9, 1.8\u00b11.7 and 1.3\u00b11.4, respectively). Patients who required intervention and who expired had positive Delta2-BLS (vs. no intervention and alive group had negative Delta2-BLS). Delta2-BLS had significant positive correlation with net fluid balance between LUS1-3 (Delta2-BLS1, Delta2-BLS2, and Delta2-BLS3, r=0. 61, p=0.010; r=0.593, p=0.015, and r=0.597, p=0.014, respectively) . Conclusions LUS appears to provide important prognostic information in AP. Serial LUS may help in assessment of volume status during fluid resuscitation and predicting severity of lung injury.",

Early diagnosis and etiology-based therapy is the key to optimum patient outcome and prevention of progression to chronic pancreatitis. We aimed to study the etiology and clinical profile of patients with recurrent acute pancreatitis. Methods All patients diagnosed with recurrent acute pancreatitis between 2016-2018 were included in the study after exclusion of chronic pancreatitis. Diagnostic tests were grouped into phase one (Biochemistry, USG and CT scan) and phase two (MRCP, EUS, IGG4). Comparison was done between idiopathic group and other major groups with known etiology. Results Total 57 patients were diagnosed with recurrent acute pancreatitis during the study period. Most common etiological factor was alcohol (35%) followed by biliary (28%). No etiology could be identified in almost 30 % of the patients. Severe disease was seen in 32% of patients. High BMI and smoking history were the factors associated with severe disease (p<0.001). Complications were seen in 38 % of the patients with mortality of 8.5%. On comparison of idiopathic group with alcohol and biliary group, alcoholic group had more severe disease decade whereas idiopathic group and biliary group had milder disease. Conclusion Alcohol was the most common etiology and was associated with severe disease most commonly. Bilary disease was the second most common etiology. No etiology could be identified in 29.8 % patients even after advanced investigation.",

Early identification of patients at risk for complications within 24 hours, the so called golden hours or therapeutic window is an important step in improving outcome. Current methods of risk stratification have limitations. They require collection of a large number of parameters and 48 hours to complete, missing a potentially valuable early therapeutic window. There is a need for an ideal prognostic marker that can help to predict severity, clinical course and possible outcome. The aim of this study was to assess the value of the plasma D-DIMER as an early prognostic marker in assessment of severity, complications and outcome in AP. Methods Fifty patients with AP were admitted and D-Dimer were determined. Bedside index for severity in acute pancreatitis criteria (BISAP) and Ranson's score was used to assess disease severity and mortality. Receiver operator characteristic curves plotted and cut-off value was determined for the variable of interest. Results D-dimer has the best predictive value for SAP and for mortality with areas under the curve of 0.957 (95% CI) and 0.987 (95% CI) respectively with 1146.5 as optimal cut-off.",

This study was done to know the outcome of patients with infected versus sterile necrosis managed with percutaneous drainage (PCD). Methods From January 2017 to May 2018, 130 patients of acute pancreatitis (AP) were screened and 53 included in study. Twenty-four patients had confirmed infected pancreatic necrosis (IPN) based on air in collection or FNAC Gram stain/culture positivity, and 29 patients had sterile pancreatic necrosis. Two groups were compared for baseline characteristics and severity scores, CT severity index, persistent organ failure (OF), hospital and ICU stay, PCD characteristics, indications and complications, post-PCD collection reduction, surgery requirement and mortality rates. Results Among 24 patients of IPN, 13 had gas in collection and 11 had Gram stain/culture positive. Most common organisms isolated were E.coli followed by Klebsiella pneumonia. Both groups were comparable for baseline clinical characteristics, APACHE II, SIRS, CT severity index, hospital and ICU stay. Baseline serum procalcitonin was significantly high in IPN (3.46 vs. 0.59 ng/mL). Overall OFs were similar in both groups, but persistent cardiovascular failure was common in sterile group (24.1% vs. 0, p value 0.01) and mechanical ventilator requirement was common in infected group then sterile (69.23% vs. 21.05%, p value 0.026). PCD up-gradation and post-PCD organ failure improvement was more in sterile group (p value 0.04). Average number mean cumulative catheter size, total duration of PCD and complications were same among two groups. Surgery was done in 4 patients of IPN, in 1 patient of sterile necrosis (p value 0.1). Mortality was higher in IPN (37.5% vs. 13.8%, p value 0.048). Conclusion IPN has higher mortality then sterile necrosis in patients managed with PCD. IPN can be suspected with high initial serum procalcitonin.",

The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of vascular complications in CP. Methods A retrospective analysis of the prospectively maintained database of patients with CP presenting to pancreas clinic from 2000 to 2018 was performed. A total of 1287 patients with CP were followed up. The presence of vascular thrombosis was identified by ultrasonography or contrast enhanced CT of abdomen. The presence of pseudoaneurysm was identified using CT angiography or digital subtraction angiography. Results One hundred and fifty-two (152/1287, 11.8%) patients with CP had vascular complications, isolated venous thrombosis in 120, pseudoaneurysm in 15 and both in 17 patients. Amongst 137 patients with venous thrombosis, involvement of splenic vein, portal vein and both were seen in 82 (59.9%), 29 (21.1%) and 26 (19%) patients respectively. Only 42 (30.6%) patients with vascular thrombosis had presence of varices on endoscopy, of which 18 (13.1%) patients had gastrointestinal bleed and were managed endoscopically. Thirty-two patients had pseudoaneurysm, most commonly in the splenic artery (75%), gastroduodenal artery (18.8%), left gastric artery (3.1%) and 1 patient had pseudoaneurysm in pseudocyst wall. Gastrointestinal bleed was the presenting manifestation in 19 (59.3%) patients with pseudoaneurysm. Amongst 32 patients, 18 (56.2%) underwent angiographic coil or glue embolization, 2 patients underwent surgery, 1 patient underwent endoscopic ultrasound guided glue injection, 2 patients had thrombosed pseudoaneurysm and the follow up data was not available for 9 patients. Conclusion This is probably the largest series evaluating vascular complications in CP. Venous thrombosis is more common than pseudoaneurysm in patients with CP. Despite the presence of venous thrombosis, varices and variceal bleed are infrequent in patients with CP. Patients with pseudoaneurysms have greater bleeding risk which needs to be tackled more aggressively.",

The chance of occurrence of this complication varies from 3 to 15 percent of cases in various studies worldwide. About 5 percent of post ERCP pancreatitis will follow a severe course, requiring prolonged hospitalization. Aims and Objectives To study the incidence of post ERCP pancreatitis in patients who underwent ERCP for management of obstructive jaundice. To identify the possible risk factors for PEP. To study the course and management of PEP. Methods Total 384 patients were included . The duration of study is from January 2017 to July 2018. All the patients were subjected to either CT scan abdomen or MRCP before subjecting for therapeutic ERCP for various etiological conditions of obstructive jaundice. After the ERCP, these patients were followed for any development of pancreatitis. Diagnosis of PEP was made according to standard Atlanta classification, which mandates the presence of 2 of the three following features. a. Pain abdomen typical of acute pancreatitis b. 3-fold elevation of amylase/ lipase c. Evidence of pancreatic inflammation on abdominal imaging. These patients were further classified into mild moderately severe and severe basing on revised Atlanta classification. Results Mean age of the patients was 54 years of which males were 256 (67%) and females were 128 (33%). Most common indication for ERCP was choledocolithiasis 212 (46.9%) followed by CBD stricture 54 (11.9%) malignant CBD stricture 35 (7.7%) cholangiocarcinoma 47 (10.3%) pariampullary growth 32 (7.07), pancreatic malignancy 41 (9.09%). PEP developed in 12 (3.125%) patients. Nine patients had mild pancreatitis 2 patients had moderately severe pancreatitis, one patient developed severe pancreatitis. All the patients were managed conservatively, and no mortality was reported in our centre. (28 questions) were used to assess QOL in patients with CP. The results of the questionnaire give scores (during the past week) for global health status (GHS) ranging from 1(very poor) to 7 (excellent) but for the five functional and symptom scale ranges from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much). For nutritional status, body mass index (BMI) was used. Results A total of 107 diagnosed patients of CP (mean age 31.4\u00b1 10.9 yrs; males, 82; alcohol aetiology, 24; diabetes mellitus, 31; steatorrhea, 19; mean duration of symptoms, 3.91\u00b14.9 years; mean BMI 19.5\u00b1 3.6 Kg/ m2) were included in the study. The GHS score was 4.5\u00b11.6 and the perceptions of functional (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social) scales ranged from 1.14\u00b10.34 to 1.52\u00b10.6. The pancreatic pain scale was 1.4\u00b10.5. There was no difference in all the domains of QOL between males vs. females or diabetics versus non-diabetics. There was negative weak correlation between BMI and fatigue (r=-0.320, p=0.001). Conclusion Contemporary quality of life assessment show that GHS was between averages to fair in patients with CP. Diabetes mellitus did not have an adverse effect on QOL and a better nutritional status translates into less fatigue in patients of CP.",

            "text": "Aim The present study was aimed at defining vascular changes in acute pancreatitis (AP) using contrast enhanced CT angiography (CTA). Methods In a prospective observational study 50 consecutive patients of AP underwent a contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scan when CT angiography (CTA) was done including arterial, venous, portal venous and delayed phases. Presence and site of necrosis and location of fluid collections were noted. At CTA arterial and venous changes were classified as compression, thrombosis, aneurysm and hemorrhage. Arteries and veins studied were those in and around pancreas. Correlation was made between vascular changes and etiology of AP, presence of necrosis and fluid collections. Results Of the 50 patients (30 males, age 18-77 years, etiology-gallstones: 24, alcohol: 16, others: 10), 41 (82%) had acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) and 9 (18%) had acute interstitial pancreatitis (AIP). On CECT 7 patients had pancreatic fluid collections, 33 had extra-pancreatic collections and 6 had both. On CTA 24 patients (48%) had vascular changes, 10 only venous, 3 only arterial and 11 both. Fourteen (28%) patients had arterial changes in splenic and pancreatoduodenal artery (6 each), hepatic and left gastric artery (5 each) and others (8). Twenty-one (42%) patients showed venous changes in splenic vein (13), superior mesenteric vein (10) and portal vein (4). Ten patients had venous compression and 21 had partial/complete thrombosis. Vascular changes occurred exclusively in ANP, with only 1/9 of AIP developing venous thrombosis. Vascular changes were significantly (p<0.05) more in alcoholic AP than gallstone AP (68.1% vs. 50%) and in those with fluid collections than those without it (57.1% vs. 12.5%). Conclusion Vascular changes occur frequently in AP with venous changes in 42% patients and arterial in 28%. Patients with ANP, alcohol etiology and fluid collections have the vascular changes more often. Introduction Pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCN) are rare comprising <10% of pancreatic neoplasms. But their occurrence has dramatically increased over last few decades due to widespread availability of cross sectional imaging, endosonogram, endoscopic tissue retrieval and HPE Methods All patients of PCN attending department of gastroenterology from January 2009 to December 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. Clinical features are analyzed along with imaging findings of CT, MRI, EUS along with FNA cytology, CEA, CA19-9 and cyst fluid amylase if available. Results We report a total of 26 cases of suspected PCNs. Of the 26, 11 cases (42.3%) females and 15 cases (57.7%) males with M:F ratio 3:2. Mean age of presentation was 56+/-7 years, ranging from 24 to 76 years. Around 40% are incidental detected, in the rest 60%, 27% had pain, 20% had mass lesion and other symptoms in the rest. Most frequent location was head (57%). Mean size of the lesion was 35 mm ranging from 11 mm to 94 mm. Benign lesions were 55% and malignant were 32% and around 13% are indeterminate due to lack of histology and equivocal imaging findings and advised close follow up and monitoring. Of the benign lesions 10 cases are mucinous cystadenoma (38.46%), 3 are serous cystadenomas (11.63%) both accounting for 51.97%. Of the malignant cases, 8 are mucinous cystadenocarcinomas (32.76%) and 3 cases serous cystadenocarcinomas (3.84%) accounting to 36.59%. Four cases were indeterminate (15.38%). EUS done in 100% and FNA results were obtained in 19 cases (73.03%); we haven't encountered any significant complications in any of them. About 65.38% cases were referred for surgical management. Conclusion PCNs are common in middle to elderly age group with M:F ratio in our data 3:2. Indeterminate results were found in significant number of cases (15.38%). Considerable proportion of cases were seen in asymptomatic individuals while abdominal pain and mass are the most common symptoms. Most common benign lesion is mucinous cystadenoma and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma is most common malignant lesion.",

Intrapancreatic stricture of the common bile duct may be either a fibrotic inflammatory restriction or compression by a pseudocyst. The aim of present study is to study the clinical presentation, type of stricture, efficacy of endoscopic management of CBD Stricture in chronic pancreatitis. Methods A total of 21 cases of chronic pancreatitis with obstructive jaundice admitted in the Department of Gastroenterology, Gandhi Hospital, Secunderabad were studied from January 2017 to February 2018. A detailed history, clinically examination, all relevant investigations, endoscopic management and follow up up to 6 months were analyzed. Results Out of 21 cases studied,15 (71.4%) were males and 6 (28.57%) were females. All were between age of 28 to 80 yrs. Eleven (52.4%) cases had significant alcoholic history, 6 (28.6%) had both alcoholic and smoking history. Mean duration of pancreatic symptoms before the diagnosis of CBD stricture is 5.5 yrs (2 months to 15 yrs). Steatorrhea present in 5 (23.8%) cases, diabetes in 3 (14.3%) cases, cholangitis in 6 (28.57%) cases, portal hypertension in 3 (14.3%) cases. Out of 3 cases presented with portal hyper tension 2 cases had splenic vein thrombosis 1 had portal vein thrombosis. On ERCP according to Caroli and Nora classification Type I stricture present in 13 (62%) cases, Type II in 2 (9.5%) cases, Type III in 0%,Type IV in 2 (9.5%) cases, Type V in 4 (19%) cases. Stones above the stricture present in 2 (9.5%) cases. ERCP was successful in 19 (90.47%) cases, 2 (9.5%) cases had failed cannulation. Two (9.5%) cases had pancreatic pseudocyst, 5 (23.8%) cases had pancreatic head carcinoma. All cases were managed with sphincterotomy and biliary plastic stents, in 2 cases pseudocyst drainage was done. LFT improved in all cases over a mean duration of 4 weeks. All cases were followed up for 6 months. Repeated stenting was done in only 3 (14.3%) cases within 5 months duration. Three cases lost follow up. Two patients died. Conclusion Type I is most common in CBD stricture in chronic pancreatitis followed by type V. CBD stricture is more common in males. Associated exocrine and endocrine deficiencies are low. Endoscopic management of CBD stricture is highly successful.",

Methods 3D mapping of trachea esophageal tree was done with the CT scan. The defect was oval in shape with wider mouth in tracheal side then esophageal side. Defect was 3 cm below vocal cords and upper esophageal sphincter. A ASD closure device with waist thickness of 4 mm was chosen. As there was no pusher and sheath available to accommodate the device it was decided to do as a hybrid procedure both cardiologist and endoscopist doing it under endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance. As device's distal flange is wider and defect was wider on tracheal side, we placed wider end on tracheal side over a guidewire. 20 mmm 16 mm and 12 mm devices were tried. Due to previously undetected tracheomalacia 12 mm device was accommodated but was leading to significant luminal compromise which was confirmed on simultaneous bronchoscopy. Lumen failed to expand consistently due to tracheomalacia despite dilatation with various diameter balloon. Hence after discussion with relatives the device was not released. Results We had a case where despite technical success we could not release the ASD closure device for tracheoesophageal fistula as there was previous undetected tracheomalacia which was not picked up on CT. Child went well home next day with a plan of possible surgery at a later age. Conclusions ASD devices can potentially be used for tracheoesophageal fistula as either a bridge to surgery or for palliation of malignancy. Preprocedure detection of tracheomalacia is important to document before attempting the procedure.",

A 60-year-old lady was suffering from type 4 cholangiocarcinoma, already had bilateral SEMS in place for obstructive jaundice. She had history of multiple abdominal surgery and had peritoneal spread of malignancy. Hence EUS guided GB drainage was done for palliation of symptoms. Methods Under general anesthesia procedure was done with proper consent with therapeutic Pentax EUS scope. Gallbladder was grossly distended with thickened wall. She had mild neurological dysfunction also due to sepsis (Tokyo grade 3). Gallbladder was punctured with 19 G EUS needle and tract was dilated with 6F cystotome. A 16 mm x 20 mm FCSEMS (Honto stent, Mitra Medical) was placed. During the last steps scope accidentally fell off the duodenal cap and the stent was deployed at the pylorus. Attempt was made to reposition stent with help of rat tooth forceps and snare but failed. Attempt to push with upper GI scope failed due to larger diameter of stent. Hence stent was gradually pushed with side viewing endoscope. After pushing, mouth of the stent was abutting the medial wall of duodenum. A NJ-tube was placed to anchor the mouth which gradually pushed the stent laterally in next 2 days. Patient was started orally after 2 days and went home on day 3. Results EUS guided gallbladder drainage is done for palliation in cases of cholecystitis for palliation. We had a case of gastric outlet obstruction due to misplaced stent during GB drainage. Complication was managed by gradually pushing the stent carefully into duodenum and placement of NJ-tube. Conclusions For accidental misplacement of GB drainage stent at pylorus, pushing the stent with SVE for repositioning followed by anchoring with NJ may be attempted. Aims and Objectives The objectives of this study were to share our experience in performing endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) to determine the nature of left adrenal lesions in a collective cohort of patient who underwent EUS with or without FNA. Methods During a period of one year from December 2016 to January 2017, data on consecutive patients who underwent linear EUS with or without EUS-FNA were prospectively collected in gastroenterology department of SMS Hospital, Jaipur. Patient data collected those who came for EUS FNA for other indication but found incidentally adrenal mass. Results In total, 14 EUS-FNA specimens (from 13 males and 1 female) were obtained from adrenal glands. The mean patient age was 55 years (range, 27-88 years). Adequate cellularity was in all 14 samples. Six of 14 samples (42.85%) were positive for carcinoma, four out of six were CA lung and one was malignant metastasis of CA esophagus and one metastatic adenocarcinoma with undetected primary lesion. All samples diagnosed as metastatic adrenal mass were confirmed on subsequent follow up except one who had not found any primary lesion. Seven out of fourteen were found to have tubercular histology. Five of these seven samples had tubercular involvement from the lung, and two samples had direct tubercular involvement of adrenal gland. In one out of fourteen patients, FNA of adrenal mass noted chronic inflammatory cells. No complications were reported during and after EUS-FNA of adrenal glands. Conclusions Tubercular involvement of adrenal is common. For confirming the diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma to the adrenal glands linear EUS-FNA biopsy is a highly diagnostic and safe technique. During EUS imaging, screening of adrenal gland should be done in every suspected mass lesion in lung and mediastinum.",

In the course of the disease most of these patients will require palliative treatment because of obstruction, fistula, jaundice, itching, pain or hemorrhage. Various endoscopic and surgical procedures can be offered to these patients. However, the potential risk of each treatment must be balanced carefully with the expected benefits and the prognosis of the individual patient. Consequently, endoscopic have been increasingly used for palliation in recent years. Methods We share an overview on endoscopic palliation of GI tumors on the basis of our own experience. In this study, we highlight specific GI malignancies (i.e. esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, biliary and colon) and how the application of minimally invasive techniques has benefitted patients. We retrospectively screened the records of patients with advanced GI malignancies taken for palliative stenting in our department from 2012 to 2017.

            "text": "Background and Aim Per oral endoscopic myotomy (PEOM) is an emerging technique for management of patients with achalasia cardia. POEM involves creation of a sub mucosal tunnel and performing a distal myotomy. One of the challenges in this procedure is the identification of the gastroesophageal junction and determining the tunnel length. Penetrating vessels of the left gastric artery are present at the level of GEJ. The present study was done with an aim to evaluate penetrating vessels as a reliable marker of GEJ. Methods All the patients who underwent POEM procedure between September 2016 to February 2018 were included in this study. In our institution the esophageal submucosal tunnel and myotomy is done preferentially in posterior wall of esophagus or in the 5 'clock position. Once the penetrating vessels were identified the tunnel was extended for 3 cm more or till a second set of \"penetrating vessels\" noted. The scale on the endoscope was used to measure the length of the myotomy. Results Of the patient 51 who underwent myotomy during this time in the institution \"penetrating vessels\" were identified in 49 (96.1%) the patients. Eight (15.7%) patients had bleeding during the procedure 4 (7.8%) had the bleeding at the gastroesophageal junction. Conclusion The penetrating vessels at GEJ are a simple and reliable method to identify the GEJ while doing POEM using the posterior approach. The vessels also pose a challenge as a narrow dissection space at GEJ increases risk of bleeding from these vessels.",

A final diagnosis was based on definitive cytopathology, surgical pathology or clinical follow up for more than 6 months. Results The etiology of esophageal stricture was benign in 10 patients (peptic:2, tubercular:2, drug induced:2, idiopathic:1, post-pancreatitis:1, post-surgical:1 and IgG4 related sclerosing esophagitis: 1) and malignant in 9 patients (squamous cell carcinoma: 5 and adenocarcinoma 4). The esophageal stricture was located in upper, mid and lower esophagus in 1, 9 and 9 patients respectively. The high-frequency 3-dimensional (3D) EUS could be successfully performed over a guide wire using catheter probe without doing dilatation in all patients. The esophageal wall stratification was lost in all patients with malignant stricture but was lost in 3/10 (30%) patients with benign strictures (p=0.03). The mean esophageal wall thickness was 11.7 mm and this was significantly greater than that in benign strictures (7.1 mm; p=0.0005). The loss of wall stratification on EUS had a sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV of 100%, 70%, 100% and 75% respectively for diagnosis of malignancy. Also, wall thickness of \u22659 mm had a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 78%, 80%, and 79% respectively for diagnosis of malignancy.

Acid by means of coagulation necrosis affects stomach mainly. Alkali produces liquifactive necrosis mainly in esophagus. The objective is to study the clinical profile, morbidity and various treatment modalities used in patients presenting with corrosive poisoning. Methods All patients undergoing endoscopy for corrosive poisoning from July 2016-2018 were included in the study. Grades of corrosive injury were analyzed with modified Zargar et al. grading. Upper GI scopy was done after 6 hours of exposure up to 5 days of ingestion and repeat scopy done after 6 weeks of ingestion. Patients with hemodynamic compromise were not taken up for scopy. Results As in developing countries, acid poisoning was common when compared with alkali poisoning. Two hundred and forty corrosive poisoning were there, out of which 140 were acid. Most common age group was 2nd and 3rd decade. Alarmingly 10 pregnant patients were there in the lot. Suicidal ingestions were having grade 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b. Oropharyngeal injury didn't correlate with the grade of injury. Eighty percent of patients with grade 2b and above injuries developed complex strictures. In esophagus, strictures were equally distributed among upper, middle and lower part. In stomach, pylorus and antral strictures were there in 8 patients. Refractory and recurrent strictures contributed to 28 and 8 percent respectively. Coloplasty was done in 10 cases, feeding jejunostomy in 13, gastrectomy in 5, and gastrojejunostomy in 5 of corrosive poisonings. Conclusion Grades above 2b injury lead to stricture formation. Unlike other studies, esophageal stricture was uniformly distributed among upper, middle and lower part. Stomach stricture was mainly localized to antrum and pylorus.",

Method The present study is a cross sectional study including all the patients taking antiplatelet and presenting with upper GI bleed. Results There were a total of 67 patients of which 51 (75%) were male and 16 (25%) were female patients. Sixty-nine percent (44) and 31% patients were taking single and dual antiplatelet respectively. Most common antiplatelet that was being used was aspirin (49%), followed by combination of clopidogrel and aspirin (32%). Most common endoscopic finding patients was erosive mucosal disease (45%). Peptic ulcer was seen in 21 patients (31%). All the patients with peptic ulcer had Forrest III grade of ulcer on endoscopy. Clinically significant proportion of patients with peptic ulcer were on aspirin whereas there was no correlation between peptic ulcer and patients taking clopidogrel or combination. Twenty-three pecent patient had tachycardia and there were no immediate cardiac complications. Patients with peptic ulcer had a Blatchford score more than 9 whereas those with a score of less than 9 had erosive mucosal disease. Conclusion Patients on long-term antiplatelets can have peptic ulcer.

Almost all alarm symptoms and signs of dyspepsia had high specificity (>80%) for diagnosing gastric malignancy except for vomiting and loss of weight. Anorexia had high positive predictive value and specificity (>80%). Conclusion Alarm symptoms like hemetemesis, dysphagia, persistent vomiting and melena has high PPV and specificity. Only anorexia has been found to have a high positive predictive value in predicting gastric Introduction In pregnancies with portal hypertension, 30% to 50% suffer from portal hypertension associated complications, mainly variceal bleed and hepatic failure. The main stay of treatment for variceal bleed remains endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL). Pregnant patients at risk for variceal bleed should receive primary prophylaxis, with either endoscopic variceal ligation or Beta-blockers. In this study we evaluate endoscopic band ligation of esophageal varices in pregnant women with portal hypertension and the safety of prophylactic endoscopic band ligation (EBL) . Methods An open labelled study was carried out which included, 32 pregnant women with portal hypertension and esophageal varices, who underwent endoscopic variceal ligation, between October 2017 to June 2018 in Department of Gastroenterology, Gandhi Hospital, Secunderabad.",

Among treatment options, dietary modification and exercise are difficult to sustain and bariatric surgery is an irreversible intervention. Intragastric balloon (IGB) is a simple and reversible option. Our aim was to assess the tolerability, safety and efficacy of the IGB in obese patients. We included all consenting obese patients (BMI 30 kg/m2) who underwent IGB placement after a trial of exercise and dietary modification in last 2 years. IGB was filled with 500 mL solution of saline and methylene blue. And increased up to 700 mL if there was no weight loss by 4 weeks. Patients were followed up regularly up to IGB removal. Results Thirteen patients (6 males, median age 38 years [32-67 years]) underwent IGB placement. Average indwelling time was 8.4 months (6 to 12 months). Premature removal was done in 3 patients (aspiration pneumonitis in 1 (67 M, diabetes) and intolerability in 2 patients). One patient developed perforation (managed conservatively) after a year of IGB (liver cirrhosis, weight loss 12 kg). There was no significant weight loss in 2 patients. In remaining 8 patients, pre and post IGB median weight was 93 kg (74-96 kg) and 78 kg (67-84 kg), (p 0.05) and median BMI was 32 (30-38.3) and 28 (25-33), (p 0.05). Percent BMI reduction was 12.5% (p 0.05). Discussion Conclusion IGB is safe, well tolerated and effective for shortterm weight loss (62%, 8/13). Failure to loss weight may be seen in patients with intolerance leading to premature removal (n=2) and in those who are non-compliant with diet and exercise (n=2). Potential complications IGB are aspiration (n=1, premature removal) and perforation which may be seen in patient with co-morbidities (n=1). Perforation occurred in a cirrhotic and he was managed endoscopically. Conclusion IGB is an simple and effective for weigh loss in obese patients.

Cytology evaluation is widely accepted as a cost-effective method that allows rapid interpretation and triaging of material. Methods This is a retrospective analytical study done in Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore. Data regarding biopsy and cytology of specimens (crush and brush cytology) of GI lumen collected in suspicion of malignancy during UGI scopy and colonoscopy procedures conducted in Gastroenterology department from June 2015 to March 2017 were collected. Analysis of data was done to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of cytologic techniques and comparison with concurrent biopsy results in the diagnosis of malignancy. Results Total of 202 samples (195 crush and 7 brushings) were procured during endoscopic procedures for analysis of malignant cytology. The mean age of the patient group was 58.72\u00b113.99 (IQR:52-68) yrs. Male:Female ratio was 1.33. Most common site of procurement of sample was from Upper GI tract (62.56% of crush and all of brushings), while rest were from LGI tract. Crush smears were most commonly taken from esophagus followed by stomach, while all the brushings were taken from esophagus. Brushings were positive in 28.6% of samples, while negative in 57.1% of samples and insufficient in 1case. Brush cytology when compared with histopathology had sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 66.7%, 100% and 85% respectively. Crush cytology was positive in 68.2% which included those which are suggestive and suspicious of malignancy. Crush cytology yield was comparable to histopathology of biopsy specimen with sensitivity, specificity and accuracy which were found to be 96.4%, 100% and 97.4%respectively. Conclusion Cytopathology of samples with crush smears and brushings had higher specificity and accuracy in detection of malignancy and can be used as a rapid diagnostic tool in view of faster reporting compared to histopathology. Limitations in cytopathology include insufficient sampling and smears with atypical features. Introduction Gastrointestinal (GI) fistula is one of the most complex and challenging complications encountered after surgery, associated with extensive postsurgical morbidity. Conservative treatment reported spontaneous closure rates of 15% to 71% with associated risk of sepsis, electrolyte disturbance, malnutrition. Three cases of enterocutaneous fistulae treated With Endoscopic modalities are reported. Methods Case 1: Thirty-five-year-old male, operated for Pott's spine with anterior fixation of spine developed left moderate pleural effusion. Inter coastal drainage constituted food particles. CECT chest showed esophageal pleural fistula. Patient was managed conservatively on FJ feeding for 1 month later endoscopy revealed fistulous opening at 35 cm from incisors, 2 cm above GE junction. Fistulous tract demonstrated under fluoroscopy. Cyanoacrylate glue was injected into the fistula. Case 2: 17-year-old female presented with intestinal obstruction in 2010; underwent sigmoid colostomy with Hartman's procedure. Subsequently colostomy closure and anastamosis was done. Postoperatively developed feculent discharge from suture site (left iliac fossa) which was managed conservatively; fistulous output decreased but small quantity of discharge persisted for 7 yrs. Colonoscopy showed 2 fistulous openings; at 15 and18 cm from anal verge. Enterocutaneous fistula was demonstrated under flouroscopy. Injection of cyanoacrylate Glue into opening was done. CASE 3:26-year-old male underwent ileal resection for perforation and end to end anastamosis, presented with discharge from scar of drain site of surgery for 1 month. Fistulous tract noted in right iliac fossa. 1 mL of glue injected into fistula. Results Endoscopic management was done in one session, second fistula in case 2 required two sessions. Thus, decreasing time and increasing closure rates. Conclusion GI fistula after surgery causes morbidity, sepsis and affects quality of life. Endoscopic methods offers closure rates up to 90% with less complications. Endoscopic cyanoacrylate glue injection reported safe, cost effective and less morbidity, with better results after 2-3 sessions.",

Progressive, familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) is a heterogeneous group of rare, genetic autosomal recessive disorders, resulting from defects in the mechanisms involved in bile formation with typical clinical, biochemical and histological features. These patients typically present with intrahepatic cholestasis in infancy or childhood. We report a case of a 21-month-old female child borne out of 3rd degree consanguineous wedding, presenting with acholic stools since birth along with pruritus since 6 months of age and jaundice since 6 weeks, suggestive of cholestatic jaundice. Biliary hamartomas also known as Von Meyenberg complexes are found incidentally in less than 4 percent of adults and are even less commonly seen in infants. They are considered to be arising from bile ducts that fail to involute. Often they are asymptomatic and detected incidentally. Biliary hamartomas are often multiple scattered throughout the liver. They are usually less than 1.5 cm in diameter, when they are large called as giant cystic biliary hamartomas. The importance of this condition lies in the fact that it has got high chances of malignant transformation to cholangiocarcinoma and can be confused with hepatic metastasis on imaging. Here we present a six months old male infant presented with fever, vomitings, and upon investigating found to have bicytopenia and biliary hamartomas on imaging and we also briefly review the literature of this condition.",

Exposure to high altitude, extreme exercise and dehydration is widely known to be associated with splenic infarction in sickle cell anemia. Here we present a case splenic infarction after exposure to high altitude and was later diagnosed as case of sickle cell trait. Clinical presentation A 27-year-old south Indian sportsman with no comorbid conditions, no illicit drug addiction and un remarkable past history was on a leisure trip to Ladakh, at a height of 4000 meters above sea level. He developed sudden onset pain in epigastrium and left hypochondrium associated with vomiting. Initial diagnosis of motion sickness was made however due to persistence of left hypochondriac pain detailed evaluation was done with USG abdomen, CECT abdomen and CT angiography were suggestive of splenic infraction. On subjecting patient to hemoglobulin electrophoresis diagnosis of sickle cell trait leading to splenic infarction was made. Patient was treated with I.V hydration and analgesics with gradual improvement and had no further complications. Conclusion Spontaneous infarction of spleen can occur in patients of sickle cell trait on exposure to high altitude or other conditions leading to hypoxia. Diagnosis of sickle cell trait leading to splenic infarct should be considered in a patient with left upper quadrant pain abdomen on ascent to high altitude.

The incidence of gastrointestinal stromal tumors is very low. Jejunal GISTs are extremely rare. GISTs comprise 0.2% of gastrointestinal tumors and only 0.04% of small intestinal tumors. Jejunal GISTs are the rarest subtype. Only 10% to 30% progress to malignancy. Case report A 45-year-old female referred for esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy for anemia under evaluation. She had a past history of repeated episodes of anemia for which she got multiple blood transfusions in previous two years. She denied history of melena and weight loss. Blood tests showed microcytic, hypochromic anemia. She had a positive test for stool for occult blood three times. All endoscopies were normal, failing to identify a bleeding source. Further investigation with capsule endoscopy exposed a bleeding source in the form of multiple jejunal ulcers. CT shows well defined lobulated exophytic heterogeneously enhancing soft tissue density lesion noted in pelvis in close relation to small bowel wall. Intraoperative findings were also suggestive of GIST. There was 12 x 8 cm mass seen in the wall of jejunum with no extraluminal involvement and lymph nodes metastasis. The whole mass excised and resection anastomosis of jejunum to jejunum done. Histopathological appearance and immunohistochemical profile of the mass confirmed high-grade gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Imatinib mesylate 400 mg once daily was given as adjuvant chemotherapy, and patient is asymptomatic without any evidence of tumor recurrence after 12 months of postoperative follow up. Conclusion GIST can have multiple clinical pictures and unusual symptoms, such as anemia, obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. This case report highlights the rarity of jejunal GISTs and as extensive initial investigation yielded all false-negative results, indicates the difficulty in diagnosing jejunal GIST resulting in progression to unusually large jejunal GIST.",

After which she was having intermittent episodes of small bowel diarrhea which increases after food intake along with abdominal pain and bloating sensation. She has increasing symptoms for last 7 yrs with increasing frequency and nocturnal episodes. The symptoms were related to some food items like-chapati, bread etc. She also developed pedal edema and abdominal distension for past 1 month. Symptoms were associated with failure to gain weight, skin changes and secondary amenorrhea. On examination, she is short statured and have features of protein energy malnutrition and signs of nutritional deficiencies. Investigations revealed low ferritin anemia, low albumin level (1.7 g/dL), increased INR. Her anti-TTG level was high. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed scalloping of D2 folds with biopsy showed focal blunting of intestinal villi with increased intraepithelial lymphocytes >30/100 intestinal epithelial cells suggestive of celiac disease. Colonoscopy was normal. Upper GI endoscopic biopsy showed microgranulomas favoring Crohn's disease. MR enterography showed mild diffuse bowel wall thickening noted involving proximal jejunal loops. Hence, we arrived at a diagnosis of celiac disease coexisting with Crohn's disease after discussion with the pathologist and considering history of fistula and MR enterography findings. She was given a trial of gluten free diet and nutritional rehabilitation for malnutrition and she showed initial significant improvement in general condition and is under follow up. Conclusion Celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease are chronic inflammatory conditions of gastrointestinal tract. These immune mediated diseases may co-exist, but rare. As per literature, around 1% to 3.2% of celiac disease patients have IBD. Increased recognition of coexistent IBD and celiac disease can prompt clinicians to investigate for concomitant disease.",

On examination sternal tenderness was elicited and there was massive splenomegaly. blood investigation showed elevated WBC count with 82% blasts. Upper GI endoscopy showed ulceronodular lesion in the a body of stomach. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy of ulceronodular lesion in stomach both were suggestive of large B cell lymphoma/ Burkitt lymphoma. Flow cytometry was positive for CD 19, CD 20 and CD 38. Confirmed to have B cell lymphoblastic leukemia with GI involvement. chemotherapy with MCP 841 protocol was administered. Repeat bone marrow aspiration and upper GI endoscopy were normal after 1 month of therapy. Conclusion GI involvement of hematological malignancy is seen in 15% to 20% of patients. Early diagnosis and treatment help to achieve remission in 70% to 80% of patients.",

The most common source is biliary followed by abdominal infection and hematogenous spread. We describe a patient with liver abscess caused by a fish bone which penetrated into liver capsule through the gastric wall. Methods A 65-year-old male presented with history of fever and mild abdominal discomfort. He was evaluated and was found to have a liver lesion on ultrasonography. Triphasic CECT scan abdomen revealed a liver abscess in segment 4 with hyper dense linear material within. On probing, there was history of fish bone ingestion a month earlier. Endoscopy did not reveal any gastric lesion or breach in mucosa. He was given antibiotics and taken up for surgery. Laparoscopic liver abscess drainage was done and foreign body-fish bone was noted within the abscess. Patient improved clinically and was doing well on follow up. Conclusion Liver abscess due to fish bone penetrating liver capsule through stomach is very rare. The transgastric penetration of foreign body should be kept in mind whenever there is unusual cause of liver abscess with foreign body within.",

The treatment of this rare condition should be based on the individual's clinical status. The rarity of this case is the atypical site of CBD perforation and its occurrence at a relatively young age. Case Summary Fifty-one-year-old male presented with pain in abdomen. On examination patient had icterus with tenderness in abdomen. CECT of abdomen was suggestive of subphrenic biloma. EUS showed distal CBD stone. In HIDA scan there was biliary leak from left hepatic duct. We managed patient successfully with external drainage of biloma and endoscopic stone removal. Patient was discharged after 8 days of hospitalization in stable condition. Discussion In spontaneous perforation of the bile duct the majority of cases are related to choledocholithiasis. Other causes include pregnancy, acalculous cholecystitis, choledochal cyst etc. Abdominal USG, and CT can aid to primary lesion and intra-abdominal collection. Biliary leakage can be detected through nuclear medicine studies or via intraoperative cholangiography. The role of surgical treatment in cases of spontaneous bile duct rupture is unclear. The most preferred treatment modality is ERCP with stone extraction. Conclusion This case emphasizes on conservative surgery which is the mainstay of treatment in the acute presentation.",

Sarcina ventriculi is a Gram-positive organism, which has been reported to be found rarely, in the gastric specimens of patients with gastroparesis. Only eight cases of Sarcina, isolated from gastric specimens have been reported so far. Sarcina has been implicated in the development of gastric ulcers, emphysematous gastritis and gastric perforation. A case is being described where a 47-year-old female presented with anorexia, dyspepsia, vomiting, loss of appetite, and weight loss for 2 months. Results of routine laboratory tests were within normal limit except mild decrease in hemoglobin. Abdominal computed tomography scan demonstrated a gastric outlet obstruction.

Results Of 41 patients, four (9.8%) underwent THE while 37 (90.2%) underwent TTE. Twenty-four (58.5 %) had a stapled anastomosis and 17 (41.5%) had a hand sewn anastomosis. Four patients had a post-op anastomotic leak. Thirty-eight patients (87.8%) received pre-op chemotherapy. Mean time for development of dysphagia after surgery was 4.5 months for THE and 5.7 months for TTE. Mean sessions required for stricture dilatation was 2.8 (range 2-6) and all strictures could be dilated completely (till 14 mm). Stricture recurrence developed in 13 (31.7%) patients at a mean duration of 7 months (1-36 months), all of whom had undergone TTE. Complete dilatation was achieved in 92% (12/13) of these patients.

Results Total 143 patients with suspected CD were included in this study and 110 patients were diagnosed as CD, 15 patients were USCD on histology. We considered histopathology as gold standard for detecting villous atrophy. Endoscopy with NBI detected villous atrophy in 97cases (88.18%) in D1 out of 110 cases who were confirmed having villous atrophy in D1 by histological examination. Endoscopy with NBI was able to detect villous atrophy in 82 cases (87.23%) out of 94 cases which were confirmed as having villous atrophy in D2 by histological examination. In the first part of duodenum, endoscopy with NBI had sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and diagnostic accuracy of 88.18%, 90.91%, 97%, 69.77%, and 88.81% respectively. Similar procedure for second part of duodenum had Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPVand diagnostic accuracy of 87.23%, 89.8%,94.25%, 78.5% and 88.11% respectively.

Currently minimally invasive endoscopic drainage of pancreatic pseudocyst (PPC) and walled off pancreatic necrosis (WOPN), under EUS-guidance by Seldinger technique by using either double-pigtail (DPT) plastic stents or fully covered short flanged metal stent (NAGI) is the preferred mode of drainage. We evaluated the clinical outcomes, success rate, and adverse events of EUS-guided drainage of pancreatic fluid collection with DPT and NAGI in PPC. Methods Forty consecutive patients undergoing EUS-guided drainage of PPC were included in the study. EUS evaluation of PPC for size, location, content (debris), wall thickness and collaterals was done. Main outcome measures studied were technical success, clinical efficacy and complications. EUS guided cystogastrostomy with placement of either DPT stents or NAGI with/without ENCD placement was done",

Factor assays VIII and IX were sent and confirmed the diagnosis of hemophilia A, liver biopsy was suggestive of alcoholic steatohepatitis. On postoperative day 12 patient developed wound dehiscence which was managed with wound manager and daily dressings. Two intra-abdominal collections and a gastrocutaneous fistula were diagnosed on CECT abdomen. Postoperative course was complicated by development of fungiemia, septicemia, shock, seizures and cortical blindness which were appropriately managed. The patient finally was discharged after 73 days of hospitalization and needed 23 units of O negative PRC's, 18 units of cryoprecipitates",

Most studies have focused on the patient while the caregivers' health has not received much attention. Methods Cross sectional study of 40 caregivers (CG) of cirrhosis patients and 40 age and sex matched controls. Quality of life (QOL) was assessed by WHOQOL-BREF, caregiver burden by Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), anxiety and depression by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Unpaired t test, one-way ANOVA and Pearson correlation coefficient were used as statistical tools. Results Thirteen males and 27 females formed the CG group with mean age 38.38\u00b113.01 years. Majority (55%) were wives, 50% had other caregivers along with primary caregiver. Mean scores of physical, psychological, social and environmental domains of WHOQOL-Bref were significantly lower in cases compared to controls-46.85\u00b111.99 vs. 81.8\u00b17.1 (p<0.001), 44.30\u00b114.47 vs. 82.28\u00b16.27(p<0.001), 44.05\u00b119.05 vs. 80.7 \u00b16.59 (p<0.001) and 43.85\u00b113.30 vs. 86.75\u00b16.42 (p<0.001) respectively.",

In our study we aim to find common causes and anatomy of biliary strictures. Methods In this retrospective study, 506 patients with obstructive jaundice and biliary obstruction admitted in department of gastroenterology, Gandhi Hospital, who underwent ERCP, from March 2008-March 2018 were included. Data regarding causes of strictures and ERCP findings were analyzed. Results Of 506 patients, 216 (42.7%) were women and 290 (57.3%) were men with mean age 51 years (14-84). Benign etiology was found in 179 (35.3%), malignant 305 (60.2%) and indeterminate 22 (4.3%) cases. Malignant causes being periampullary growth 134 (44%), cholangiocarcinoma 112 (36.7%), carcinoma pancreas 40 (13%), gallbladder carcinoma 14 (4.5%) and liver metastasis 3 (1%) with metastasis from colon, breast and mandibular cancer. Benign causes include chronic pancreatitis 6 5 ( 3 6 . 3 % ) , b e n i g n d i s t a l C B D s t r i c t u r e s 5 1 ( 2 8 . 4 % ) , postcholecystectomy injury 26 (14.5%), PSC 8 (4.4%), portal biliopathy 4 (2.2%), mid CBD stricture 4 (2.2%), recurrent cholangitis 6 (3.3%), post traumatic 2(1%), mirizzi syndrome 2 (1%), pancreatic divisum 1 and tuberculosis 1. Site of obstruction was Distal CBD 355 (70%), proximal CBD 32 (6.3%), Mid CBD 30 (5.6%), CHD 68 (13.4%), hepatic ducts 43 (8.4%) and hilar 31 (6.1%). Choledocholithiasis was present in 27 (8.8%) of malignant strictures. Biliary drainage with stent placement was done in 414 (82%), SEMS was placed in 6 and rest of patients were referred for surgery or PTBD. Conclusion Malignant biliary strictures are more common than benign strictures. Distal CBD is the most common site of biliary strictures and Mid CBD strictures are least common. Chronic pancreatitis is most common benign cause and periampullary growth in malignant strictures. Biliary obstructions can be managed by stent placement in most of the patients with minimal complications. SEMS can be used for palliative management of non resectable malignant strictures.",

Aims A prospective evaluation of outcomes (success rate and complication rate) of patients undergoing endoscopic ultrasound guided biliary drainage (EUS-BD). Methods A prospective observational study of EUS guided biliary drainage carried out from June 2017 to May 2018 at a tertiary care hospital. Patients undergoing EUS-BD due to failed ERCP and more than 18 years of age were included in study. Patients who refused to participate were excluded. EUS was performed using a therapeutic linear array echoendoscope under general anesthesia. EUS-guided rendezvous technique (EUS-RV) or EUS guided Antegrade Technique attempted in patients with an endoscopically accessible ampulla followed by the transluminal technique for a failed rendezvous attempt. As for transluminal biliary drainage, EUS-guided hepaticogastrostomy (EUS-HGS) was performed in patients with proximal biliary obstruction, surgically altered anatomy, or duodenal obstruction, while EUS-guided choledochoduodenostomy (EUS-CDS) was reserved for patients with middle or distal biliary obstruction. Prophylactic broadspectrum antibiotics was administered intravenously to all patients prior to the procedure and after the procedure. Results Total 25 patients included in this study. Male patients-16, female patients-9. EUS guided HGS-2 patients, EUS RV-9 patients, EUS guided antegrade-12 patients, CDS-none, procedure failed in 2 patients who underwent PTBD. Success rate-92%.

They are rare neoplasms that are derived from neuroendocrine cells interspersed within the gastrointestinal system and throughout the body. Objective To study the Prevalence of neuroendocrine tumors in patients undergoing elective polypectomies in a tertiary referral hospital in the state of Telangana, Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Continental Hospitals, Hyderabad. Methods This prospective study between June 2017 and July 2018 included patients who underwent polypectomies with Histopathological examination for polyps in the GI tract diagnosed on a previous endoscopy/colonoscopy. Diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumors was made on histopathological examination and confirmed with immunohistochemistry marker studies with chromogranin-A, synaptophysin, NSE, CD-56 and Ki-67. Results A Total of 1280 upper GI endoscopies and 824 colonoscopies were performed. 425 polypectomies were performed and sent for HPE of which 24% (n=102) were positive for neuroendocrine tumor. The commonest site was stomach 36 (35.3%), followed by duodenum 24 (23.5%), rectum 16 (15.6%), cecum 10 (9.8%), left colon 8 (7.8%), right colon 8 (7.8%). Only 1 (0.98%) patient presented with carcinoid syndrome. Immunohistochemistry marker studies with chromogranin-A, synaptophysin, NSE, CD-56 and Ki-67were done for all patients for confirmation with at least 1 marker positive for each patient. Conclusion 1. There are limited studies analyzing the prevalence of NETs in GI polyps, hence our study highlights this importance. 2. Prevalence of neuroendocrine tumors in polyps in our study was 24%. 3. NETs were detected in even small polyps measuring 2 x 2 mm. Methods It was a hospital based cross sectional observational study. All the consecutive patients presented with portal hypertension who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were included in the study. The study period was from 1st September 2015 to 31st August 2016. Results During the study period, 71 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the study. All the data were collected as per predesigned proforma and analyzed statistically. The majority of the patients 21 (29.6%) were between 51-60 years age group. There were more males (78.9%) then females (21.1%). The mean age of study population was 50.85 years with standard deviation of \u00b112.47. Among the study patients, rapid urease test was positive in 50 (70.4%).The histopathological examination findings showed chronic superficial gastritis without activity and negative for H. pylori in 38 (53.52%), chronic superficial gastritis without activity and positive for H. pylori in 3 (4.23%), chronic active gastritis and negative for H. pylori in 13 (18.3%), chronic active gastritis and positive for H. pylori in 15 (15%), normal gastric mucosa in 1 (1.41%) and presence of dilated blood vessels suggestive of portal hypertensive gastropathy in 1 (1.41%).

It is usually done under fluoroscopic guidance which ensures safety of procedure even though it carries risk of radiation exposure. However, with expertise and in selected patients' procedure can be done without fluoroscopy. The present study aims to assess the technical, clinical success and safety of EUS guided cystogastrostomy without fluoroscopic guidance. Methods This was a retrospective study. In a six-month period, EUS guided cystogastrostomy patients who underwent procedure without fluoroscopy were retrospectively reviewed. Results Out of 30 cystogastrostomy patients, 6 underwent EUS guided cystogastrostomy without fluoroscopy. Reason was due to nonavailability of fluoroscopy and the need for procedure. Mean age was 33 yrs (range 14-42). Five were male, 1 was female. Etiology was alcohol related pancreatitis (4), traumatic (1) and idiopathic pancreatitis (1) . Symptoms were fever/sepsis in 4 and pain abdomen in 2 patients. Four were pseudocysts and 2 were WON (debris 30% to 50%). All were located within access from stomach fundus/proximal body (near body, tail or in lesser sac). On imaging, all had definite wall, ovoid shape. Mean duration of pseudocyst/WON was 8 wks (range 4-12). Pseudocyst/WON size ranged from 4-12 cm (mean 8 cm). All underwent cystogastrostomy in standard manner -19G needle puncture -guidewire placement into cyst cavity-tract dilatation with balloon-second guidewire through dilator. Two (8 Fr) stents were placed in pseudocysts and each WON had 1 stent (8 Fr) and NBD (7 Fr). Duration of procedure was 45-90 min (mean 65.25 min). There were no serious complications. Symptomatic response was seen in all patients. Four pseudocysts had complete and 2 WON had partial resolution on follow up imaging at 1-2 wks. None needed reintervention.Conclusions EUS guided cystogastrostomy can be done in selected group (>4 wks, body/tail or lesser sac, ovoid shape) without fluoroscopy with good clinical, technical success and safety profile.",

Raymond et al. (1983) and Sheers et al. (1989) first described colonic diaphragmatic disease. They have been observed to be associated with long-term use of non-steroidal antiinflammatory agent. About less then fifty cases diaphragmatic disease of colon have published till date. We report a case of twenty-five-year-old female with cecal diaphragm. Case report Twenty-five-year old female presented with complaints of chronic intermittent abdominal pain since two years. She noticed cramping pain in right lower quadrant, which usually increased after a meal. She had been using oral diclofenac since last six months. No history of altered bowel habit or fever. Physical examination revealed thin built women with pallor. Abdominal examination and rest of the examination was unremarkable. Lab investigations showed iron deficiency anemia with hemoglobin 7.6 gm%. Plain radiography and ultrasonography showed no abnormalities. Contrast CT scan of abdomen revealed mildly dilated terminal ileum. Colonoscopy showed thin pliable web like stricture was noted at the cecum. Biopsy of the same showed mild non-specific inflammatory infiltrate, granulation tissue and sub mucosal fibrosis without granulomas, cryptitis or crypt abscess. CT enterography done to rule out small bowel disease was normal. Diaphragm disease of the colon is a rare condition associated with longterm use of NSAIDs. The exact pathogenesis of NSAID-induced DD remains obscure. This case demonstrates a rare complication of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent therapy that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of unexplained abdominal pai 398 Esophageal varices in pregnant women -Our experience with endoscopic band ligation Methods Prospective study conducted from January 2018 to June 2018. It included 120 patients presenting with manifestations of upper gastrointestinal bleed. The clinical and endoscopic profile was analyzed and mortality pattern was studied. Rockall scoring system was used to assess their prognosis. Results The mean age of patients was 45\u00b115.19. At presentation 75 patients had both hematemesis and melena, 27 patients had only melena and 18 patients had only hematemesis. Shock was detected in 18.7% and severe anemia found in 32.4%. The most common cause of UGIB was portal hypertension related (esophageal and gastric varices) seen in 57.5% of patients, Mallory-Weiss tear was seen in 18.2% patients, gastric erosions in 12.8% patients, peptic ulcer disease was seen in 8.7% cases, gastric malignancy in 2.8% patients. Mortality rates were higher with Rockall score >6. Conclusions In our study, variceal bleed was the most common cause of UGIB. Factors associated with increased mortality in our study were: hypotension, underlying co-morbidities, prolonged INR, elevated serum creatinine level, re-bleeding during the hospital stay and hemoglobin of <10 g%. Early risk stratification and appropriate management helps to reduce morbidity and mortality.",

It needs prompt evaluation and appropriate management. The aim of this study is to report the endoscopic profile and outcome of patients reporting with foreign bodies in the gastrointestinal tracts using upper GI endoscopy. Methods In this single centre, retrospective study, upper GI endoscopic records of all patients from January 2015 to June 2018 were collected and reviewed regarding presence of foreign bodies. The demographic profile, nature of FB ingested, location of the foreign body and success of endoscopic therapy were analyzed. Results A total number of 42 patients with foreign body in the upper gastrointestinal tract were studied. Out of which 12 were males, 16 females and 14 patients were in pediatric group. Coins (16), fish bone (8) and food bolus (10) constituted the main type of foreign bodies. The rest were ring, iron nail, aluminum foil, dentures and tablets. All the 14 children with foreign body ingestion had swallowed coin. The site of impaction and type of the foreign body is summarized in the following Table. Of the 42 cases, 39 foreign bodies was successfully removed with endoscopy. Out of the remaining, one case of foreign body esophagus (denture) had to be removed surgically by cervical esophagectomy. Other 2 cases of cricopharyngeal fish bone impaction were removed by rigid endoscope. All the cases of food bolus impaction were associated with mechanical obstruction of esophagus. None of the patients had serious complications. Conclusions Prompt and timely evaluation of a patient with history of foreign body ingestion with an upper GI endoscopy is highly effective in terms of removal of the foreign body and limiting the complications.",

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic yield of combining gene Xpert MTB/RIF and cytology test in tubercular lymphadenitis, where lymphnode tissue obtained by endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (FNAC). Methodology This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively maintained hospital records of patients with mediastinal and intraabdominal lymphadenopathy who underwent endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) for a period from March 2017 to May 2018 conducted at a referral tertiary care centre of Northen India and was diagnosed as tuberculosis. The results of endosonographic characteristics (heterogeneous echotexture and coagulation necrosis sign) AFB microscopy, cytology, AFB microscopy Xpert MTB/RIF assay, conventional culture of the lymph nodes were documented. Result Of 30 patients, 17 (57%) were female. Mean (\u00b1SD) and median (Inter-quartile range) age of the patients were 36.04 (\u00b112.52) and 33.5 (25-45) years with range of 21-66 years. Fever and weight loss, dysphagia and recurrent subacute intestinal obstruction were present in 27 (90%), 2 (7%), 1 (3%) patients respectively at time of presentation. Highest sensitivity was observed for Gene xpert (29, 97%) followed by cytology (23, 77%), AFB smears (11, 37%) and conventional culture (4, 13%). Positive tuberculosis cytology (grade I-III) and gene xpert showed overall diagnostic sensitivity of 77% and 97% for tubercular lymphadenitis respectively, which was statistically significant (p value of 0.04). Conclusion Gene Xpert MTB/RIF test is a useful tool for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with high sensitivity on EUS guided fine needle aspirate of subcarinal and intraabdominal lymphnodes with superior performance as compared to cytology and smear microscopy. Department of Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Christian Medical College, Vellore 632 004, India Introduction Vitamin D may have an effect on the incidence, severity and relapse rates in Crohn's disease. Data on vitamin D absorption in Crohn's patients is limited. Aims To determine the prevalence, risk factors for vitamin D deficiency and assess the change in vitamin D levels after 8 weeks of oral supplementation in Crohn's disease. Methods The study cohort included 159 consecutive Crohn's disease patients who attended the inflammatory bowel disease clinic of a tertiary South Indian hospital between November 2017 and May 2018. Seventy patients aged 15-70 years with baseline serum vitamin D <30 ng/ml who consented to participate and review after 2 months of treatment were included. They were given 60,000 IU of vitamin D3 once weekly for 8 weeks. Data on vitamin D usage and compliance was recorded by telephonic interview. At the end of 8 weeks, a repeat serum vitamin D was done. Paired T test was applied to check whether the increase in vitamin D after treatment was significant.Results Among 159 patients with Crohn's disease, 6 (3.8%) had severe deficiency (<5 ng/ml), 85 (53.5%) deficiency (5-20 ng/ml), 47 (29.6%) insufficiency (20-30 ng/ml) and 21 (13.2%) were normal (>30 ng/ml). Harvey Bradshaw score >7 was significantly associated with vitamin D deficiency (p=0.031). Among 45 patients followed up after 8 weeks of treatment, the mean vitamin D pre-treatment was 13+6.5 ng/ml and post treatment 30.58+11.1 ng/ml. Mean increase in vitamin D after treatment was 17.55+8.9 (p=0.00). There was no significant difference in response to vitamin D therapy with age, sex, duration, extent of involvement or severity of disease. Conclusions The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 57.3% and insufficiency was 29.6%. Vitamin D deficiency is more likely in severe disease. Oral supplementation of vitamin D was adequate to correct deficiency regardless of type or severity of Crohn's disease. Methods This retrospective study included patients with CD who were given EEN for induction of clinical response. The patients were under follow up at AIIMS, New Delhi, India from October 2017 till July 2018. Details were extracted from prospectively maintained case records for demographics, disease duration, disease phenotype and severity, treatment given, duration of EEN, response to EEN and intolerance to EEN. Results Twenty-one patients (mean age:32\u00b116 years, 76% males, 7 with fistulising disease and 3 with perianal disease) were given EEN for a median duration of 4 (IQR, 2-4) weeks. Concomitant treatment with immune-suppressants was given in 12 patients (10-steroids alone, 2steroids followed by infliximab, 1-infliximab alone). Mean CDAI improved significantly at 4 weeks (295\u00b158 vs. 212\u00b163, p<0.01) and 8 weeks (295\u00b158 vs. 199\u00b143, p<0.001) after EEN. Serum albumin and hemoglobin also improved significantly, starting at 2 weeks (hemoglobin-7.6\u00b11.4 g/dL vs. 8.7\u00b11.2 g/dL, p<0.01; albumin-2.4\u00b10.5 g/dL vs. 2.9 \u00b10.5 g/dL, p<0.01) and persisting over 4 and 8 weeks. On subgroup analysis, patients receiving EEN without concomitant immunesuppressants also showed significant improvement in CDAI at 4 weeks (305\u00b140 vs. 240\u00b160, p<0.05) and serum albumin at 2 (2.5\u00b10.5 g/dL vs. 3.1\u00b10.5 g/dL p<0.05) and 4 weeks (3.3\u00b10.5 g/dL, p<0.05). No significant difference in EEN response was observed with respect to different disease behaviour. Only 1 patient had intolerance to EEN. Conclusion EEN is effective in adults with CD in inducing clinical response both as an exclusive treatment and as an adjunct to other immunosuppressants across all disease phenotypes.",

            "text": "Comparative analysis of cost and nutritional composition of glutenfree food with their gluten containing counterparts Wajiha Mehtab 1 , Vikas Sachdev 2 , Anita Malhotra 3 , Namrata Singh 2 , Introduction Gluten-free diet (GFD) is the cornerstone treatment for patients with celiac disease (CeD). However, GFD has become a trend in general population as well. There is paucity of analysis of nutritional content and cost of gluten free (GF) food-items compared with their gluten containing counterparts. Methods Nutrient composition and cost of commonly consumed labelled GF (n=158) and non-labelled naturally GF/gluten containing (n=170) food items, systematically obtained from supermarkets of metropolitan city of India (Delhi), were compared. The nutritional content per 100 g of product and per gram cost was taken for comparison under different categories.Result GF pasta/macaroni products were found to have lower protein (7.2 g vs. 11.3 g) and higher carbohydrates (78 g vs. 73 g) compared to their gluten containing counterparts. Similarly, GF flour mixes had lower protein (9.3 g vs. 12 g) and substantially lower fiber (2.7 g vs. 13.8 g) than gluten containing flours. In case of GF biscuits, the carbohydrates were lower (54.1 g vs. 69 g) and fats were higher (26.2 g vs. 19.7 g) including saturated fat (12.7 g vs. 9.4 g) and trans fat (0.9 g vs. 0.02 g). The trans-fat content was >1.5 g in most of the GF biscuits and cookies. GF cerealbased snack foods contained higher sodium (1293 mg vs. 658.5 mg) than their gluten containing counterparts. Overall, GF foods were markedly higher in cost, ranging from 1.6 (biscuits and cookies) to 3.8 times (snack foods) higher, compared to similar gluten containing counterparts. Conclusion Compared to their gluten containing counterparts, the glutenfree foods are substantially costlier and less nutritious with respect to their protein, fiber and fat content, particularly the saturated and trans-fat. Strategies need to be developed to lower the cost and improve the nutritional profile of gluten-free food items. Visceral involvement by basidiobolomycosis is rare but has been emerging fungal infection in the stomach, small intestine, colon, and liver. Diagnosis of GIB is clinically difficult due to the fact that GIB occurs in immunocompetent patients and so it may not be clinically suspected. We report a patient presented with involving gastrointestinal tract and generalised lymphadenopathy who has been diagnosed with disseminated basidiobolomycosis. Methods We report a case of basidiobolomycosis with gastrointestinal tract involvement and intrabdominal lymphadenopathy. Results Twenty-seven-year-old housewife presented with history of: 1. Diffuse abdominal pain for 3 months; 2. Postprandial vomiting for 3 months; 3. Significant loss of weight and appetite. Previously treated twice with ATT for granulomatous inflammation on biopsy of cervical lymphadenopathy. Local and systemic examination was unremarkable. CT abdomen: Long segment circumferential wall thickening of the 2nd and 3rd parts of duodenum. Gastroscopy -duodenal nodules, proabable infiltration of mucosa. Biopsy -granulomatous duodenitis, eosinophilic microabscesses and dimorphic form with Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon favor Basidiobolomycosis. Colonoscopynormal study. CT guided FNA from paraortic nodal mass -extensive necrosis with broad fungal hyphae, consistent with Entomophthoromycosis. Treatment: She was started on T. Iatraconazole for months. On follow up after 2 months, she had significant improvement in the form generalied well being, improved appetite, weight gain, reduction of abdominal pain and vomiting. On follow up she was started on Syp potassium iodide. Conclusion GI Basidiobolomycosis presents diagnostic challenges due to lack of specific features. GI Basidiobolomycosis should be considered as the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with pain abdomen and intraabdominal lymphadenopathy after ruling out common conditions. Clinical finding may mimic malignancy, TB, or IBD. Prognosis for this disease is usually favorable,but can be fatal if not treated. Introduction Gastric stump carcinoma (GSC) following gastric surgeries is well documented in the Indian and western literature. De Novo gastric malignancy following gastrojejunostomy 42 years ago for benign disease is quite rare and scarcely reported in literature. The incidence of gastric malignancy ranges from 2% to 8% in the remnant stomach. Aim To report an unusual case of De Novo gastric cancer occurring 42 years following gastrojejunostomy for a benign disease. Case Report We present a 75-year-old male who underwent gastrojejunostomy for gastric outlet obstruction 42 years ago presented with post prandial fullness and vomiting for past 3 months. No melena. On examination patient was anemic. Abdomen had a clean scar 5 cm below the xiphisternum to umbilicus. No mass or VGP detected. Upper GI endoscopy showed post GJ status with peristomal inflammation and ulceroprolifertive lesion in the antrum. Biopsy from lesion proved to be singnet ring cell carcinoma. Discussion The incidence of GSC is more following gastric surgeries like Billroth II with partial gastrectomy than Billroth I. The procedure gastrojejunostomy alone for benign disease is quite rare and it has the last risk of developing GSC compared to Billroth II and Billroth I. Latent period for development of malignancy in the anastomotic site or remnant stomach varies from 15 to 20 years. De Novo gastric cancer can present as late as 36 years. The pathogenesis of GSC has been implicated to duodenogastric reflux of bile, hypochlorhydria, chronic inflammation, intestinal metaplasia and bacterial overgrowth. The pathogenesis of De Novo gastric cancer following gastrojejunostomy is not well understood. H pylori eradication in prevention of gastric carcinoma following gastric surgeries is debatable. Peroidic endoscopic surveillance is recommended following gastric surgeries. Conclusion De novo gastric cancer is very rare following gastrojejunostomy alone after 42 years. Case reported for its rarity. Introduction Antiphospholipid syndrome has been defined by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies or lupus anticoagulant in association with certain clinical events, including recurrent arterial and venous thrombosis and recurrent fetal loss. Definite APS is present if at least one of the clinical criteria and one of the laboratory criteria are met, with the first measurement of the laboratory test performed at least 12 weeks from the clinical manifestation. A. Clinical criteria; 1) vascularthrombosis-one or more clinical episode of arterial, venous or small vessel thrombosis confirmed by imaging or histopathology. 2) Pregnancy morbidity B. Laboratory criteria: 1) anticardiolipin antibody antibody of IgG and or IgM medium or high titre, 2) lupus anticoagulant, 3) antiibeta 2 glycoprotein-1 antibody. Methods We report a case of a young male known case of left brachiocephalic, proximal subclavian and SVC thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis and pulmonary infarction, presenting with abdominal distension since 1 month which was not associated with pedal edema, jaundice, GI bleed and pain abdomen since 1 monthdiffuse, non-radiating, not aggravated with food. Past history of admission 3 months back for swelling in right side of neck, cough, hemptysis, breathlessnes for 1 week. Nonalcoholic, nonsmoker, no specific drug history, no significant family history. Results With above history and clinical presentation, on further evaluation he had massive hemorrhagic pancreatic ascites and pseudocyst in the head of pancreas. His thrombotic workup showed laboratory evidence for primary APS with lupus anticogulant and beta 2 glycoprotein positivity and no clinical features or laboratory evidence of other autoimmune diseases. Conclusion A high index of suspicion for Antiphospholipid syndrome should be kept in patients with pancreatic ascites with previous thrombotic episodes. This case is being reported due to the rarity of antiphospholipid syndrome presenting as pancreatitis. Introduction Acute viral hepatitis, especially hepatitis A, may sometimes present as progressive hyperbiliribinemia due to prolonged cholestasis up to 9 months. On the other hand hepatitis A, hepatitis E, cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus may activate clinically inactive chronic liver disease resulting in progressive hyperbiliribinemia and hepatocellular failure. In this report we present a rare case of acute hepatitis A with progressive severe hyperbiliribinemia unmasking manifestation of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) in a young man.",

            "text": "Case Report A 21-year-old man presented with 3 months history of progressive yellowish discoloration of eyes and urine along with generalized itching and 11/2 months history of fever with anorexia and weakness. He gave no history of melena or altered sensorium. Clinical examination revealed pallor, icterus and hepatosplenomegaly. Anti-HAV IgM was reactive. Ultrasound showed coarse echotexture of liver with mild ascites. We ruled out other viral hepatitis as well as Wilson's disease. Liver function tests (LFT) initially showed markedly raised bilirubin and liver enzymes. Liver enzymes decreased over 3 months, bilirubin level continued to rise up to 30 mg%. Albumin level was normal, but globulin was gradually rising to 5.1 gm%. Serial LFTs showed AST slightly higher than normal (Table1). Prothrombin time was 18 seconds. Endoscopy showed 2 columns of grade I varix. As there was features of portal hypertension coupled with hyperglobulinemia, autoimmune hepatitis profile was done. ANA and anti-LKM1 antibodies were nonreactive whereas anti-smooth muscle antibody was reactive (1 in 80). Total IgG level was high 1733 mg% (n=620-1400). A probable diagnosis of AIH was made according to simplified diagnostic criteria adapted from Hennes et al. Patient refused liver biopsy. He was successfully treated with glucocorticoids. Conclusion Every episode of acute viral hepatitis should be evaluated for exclusion of acute exacerbation of any occult chronic liver disease. Background Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is a rare disorder that mainly affects the kidneys. The main defect is overproduction of oxalates by liver resulting in build-up of oxalate, which normally is filtered through the kidneys and excreted in the urine. The deficiency is of the liver peroxisomal enzyme alanine: glyoxylate-aminotransferase (AGT), which catalyzes the conversion of glyoxylate to glycine. When AGT activity is absent, glyoxylate is converted to oxalate, which forms insoluble calcium oxalate crystals that accumulate in the kidney and other organs leading to progressive renal involvement and chronic renal disease. Case Characteristics A 4-month-old girl infant presented with features of chronic renal disease. She was started on renal replacement therapyperitoneal dialysis from infancy along with management of hypertension and anemia. She was evaluated and diagnosed to have primary hyperoxaluria Type 1(Genetically proven). She also had multiple complications like refractory hypertension, obstructed umbilical hernia, recurrent peritoneal catheter block and peritonitis. She was then managed with hemodialysis. She was advised combined liver and kidney transplantation. However, in view of her extreme young age, low weight, and anticipated technical difficulties due to size of the child this was initially considered impossible. She finally underwent combined simultaneous live related liver and kidney transplant with right nephrectomy ( native kidney) at 21 months of age with a weight of 7.6 kg and is currently doing well. Conclusion This is the youngest reported simultaneous combined liverkidney transplantation done to date in India in a child with a weight of 7.6 kg. Levosulpiride is a substituted benzamide that is widely used in plethora of medical conditions. It is used in dyspepsia, gastroparesis, burning mouth syndrome, cataplexy, acute labrynthine dysfunction, glycemic control and premature ejaculation. Psychiatric illness such as depressive disorders, somatoform disorder and schizophrenia recommend levosulpride use. Levosulpride produces extrapyramidal symptoms as it blocks dopaminergic D2 receptor activity. We report some involuntary movements encountered with use of levosulpride. Reports 1 Isolated tremors-45-year-male was prescribed pantoprazole+ levosulpride for dyspeptic symptoms. On the next day, he developed rest and postural tremor which was mainly confined to his upper extremities. He completely recovered within 10 days of stopping the drug. 2 Parkinsonism-70-year-female, was on levosulpride for nearly 5 months for upper GI symptoms, presented with asymmetrical bradykinesia, rest tremor and rigidity since 1-month duration. Tremor and bradykinesia improved on stopping the drug but rigidity persisted. 3 Worsening of preexisting Parkinsonism-72-year-male on antiparkinsonian medication showed rapid worsening after starting levosulpride. Increasing the dose of levodopa showed no benefit. 3 Orolingual dyskinesia-52-year-female on levosulpride since 5 days, presented with acute onset of oro-lingual dyskinesia. She completely recovered in few days on stopping the drug. Conclusion We report these cases as levosulpride has to be prescribed carefully especially in elderly age group. Possibility, of neurological complications have to be explained. Isolated tremors, Parkinsonism, worsening of Parkinson disease, tardive dyskinesia, dystonia, truncal akathisia have been reported in literature with levosulpride. Some of them, though not all are completely reversible on stopping the drug.",

No abdominal pain, distention, vomiting, fever, diarrhea, urgency, fecal incontinence. Clinically-Vitals stable, normal abdominal findings. PR examination -normal. Routine investigations -Hb 12.5 gm/dL, creatinine 0.8 mg/dL, bilirubin 0.7 mg/ dL, PT 12 sec, APTT 34 sec. Colonoscopy planned after split bowel preparation. There was an impacted foreign body at recto-sigmoid junction 25 cms from anal verge. Scope not advanced further. It was removed using rat tooth forceps after disengaging it from deeply into the muscle. Utterly surprising it was a denture with sharp margins, measuring 8 cm \u00d77.5 cm! Complete ileo colonoscopy did not reveal any gross abnormality except area of abnormal mucosa with granulation tissue around the site of impaction. Biopsies-No evidence of malignancy. The distal area revealed an area of visible muscularis s/o suspicious sealed perforation. Patient gave past history of accidental ingestion of the denture 5 months back but did not consult to medical practioner for the same! CECT abdomen showed thickening at the sigmoid area, no mass, no through perforation or diverticulum. Started normal diet after 24 hours and discharged with supportive treatment. Follow up after 10 dayscompletely asymptomatic. Repeat colonoscopy planned after 1 month. We present this rare case report as such a large, sharp foreign body which was likely to get impacted in the small bowel or terminal ileum surprisingly got impacted at sigmoid colon without any mass lesion or any other gross mucosal abnormality. Introduction Ectopic varices result from portal hypertension, surgical procedures, venous outflow anomalies or abdominal vascular thrombosis, and can be familial (1) in origin. They account for 1% to 5% of GI bleeding episodes. They can occur anywhere along the GI tract, abdominal wall or even the retroperitoneal space, common sites being the duodenum (17%) and jejunum or ileum (17%). Case Presentation A 53-year-old obese man with history of significant alcohol intake presented with recurrent melena. The hemoglobin was 7.6 g/dL. There was no history of NSAID use. Prior episodes of melena in 2015 and 2016 were managed conservatively with blood transfusions and were attributed to duodenal ulcer with H pylori infection, which was eradicated. Colonoscopy 2 years ago had shown ileal varix but no intervention was required then. This time, abdomen ultrasonography showed hepatosplenomegaly. Fibroscan could not be done due to technical issues. Upper GI endoscopy showed small esophageal varices without RCS and mild portal hypertensive gastropathy. Colonoscopy showed terminal ileal varix with stigmata of recent bleed like red patch on it, for which endotherapy with histoacryl glue was done. Subsequently, the melena resolved completely. Capsule enteroscopy was done to rule out any other source of GI bleed which was normal. He was discharged after IV iron replacement with no recurrence of GI bleed and hemoglobin of 7.8 on follow up at 1 month. Conclusion Ectopic varices should be considered in patients with obscure GI bleed, especially in the presence of portal hypertension.",

            "text": "Late recurrence of colon cancer as isolated mediastinal lymphadenopathy after curative surgery G V S Raghunath Correspondence-G V S Raghunath-raghugaverneni@gmail.com Department of Medical Gastroenterology, BangaloreIntroduction Colorectal cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related death. Tumor recurrences in distant organ after resection of colon cancer is frequently seen. Among the patients with evidence of distant organ recurrence, the liver was the most common site, followed by lung, bone, and brain in descending order. The first site of recurrence of colon cancer is rarely the mediastinal lymph nodes. Solitary recurrence at this site without another site of recurrence is extremely rare. Till 2017 only 7 cases of isolated mediastinal recurrence of colorectal cancer have been reported. We are reporting a case of late recurrence of colon cancer presenting as isolated mediastinal lymphandenopathy successfully treated with resection. Case report A 74-year-old male, resident of Udupi with comorbidities of hypertension and bronchial asthma, was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of sigmoid colon in 2008 and was successfully treated with sub-total colectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy. Following which he was asymptomatic and doing well and was on regular follow up tests. PET CT done in 2017 revealed a para cardiac lymph node 3.1\u00d72.9 cm (SUV 8.8) with no mural thickening or focal hypermetabolic lesion at the anastomotic site or any other site in body. EUS done for further evaluation showed a hypoechoic lesion with irregular border of size 2.5 x 2 cm in the para-cardiac region. EUS guided FNAC was done and sent for cytological examination which Department of Medical Gastroenterology, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow 226 014, India Introduction Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder in which a genetic predisposition and the ingestion of wheat gluten triggers a deleterious immune response. Enteropathy associated T cell lymphoma is a rare primary intestinal lymphoma. It is often, but not always associated with celiac disease. Case presentation A 31-year-male presented with bloating, postprandial fullness, and significant weight loss since 4 months. Family history of celiac disease in elder sister. He had Bitemporal, supraclavicular hollowing (Fig.1) . The patient had iron deficiency anemia (hemoglobin: 8.9 g/dL). Endoscopy was normal (Fig. 2 A and B) . Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody >100. Duodenal biopsy -subtotal villous atrophy (Fig. 3) . Based on this patient was started on gluten-free diet. After a month patient had overt upper GI bleed. Ileocolonoscopy was normal ( Fig. 4 A and B) , hence single balloon enteroscopy planned which revealed circumferantial short segment ulcerated stricture in mid jejunum (Fig. 5 ) on histopathology and immunohistochemistry -T cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (Fig. 6 A and B) .The patient started on chemotherapy-CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) protocol and after 1 cycle of chemotherapy patient had intestinal perforation and died due to sepsis/poor nutritional status. Discussion The patient was exposed to gluten during all his lifetime and it is widely acknowledged that a gluten-free diet effectively prevents the development of EATL in patients with overt CeD. In this clinical case there was no formal indication to institute a gluten-free diet previous to the diagnosis of lymphoma, since the diagnosis of CeD was simultaneous to that of EATL. Conclusion This may raise the question whether silent CeD in family members of affected patient would benefits by early screening and initiation of gluten-free diet and preventing it's life threatening complication like EATL. This case draws our attention to clinically silent celiac disease, which may present directly as intestinal lymphoma.",

He reported having undergone left hemicolectomy followed by a standard 9-month treatment with isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide for subacute intestinal obstruction and descending colon stricture 4 years back. The resected specimen revealed transmural lymphocytic infiltration and non-caseating granuloma without acid-fast bacilli. Though he remained well for the next 3-y, he experienced recurrent symptoms. A colonoscopy revealed multiple rectosigmoid and colonic ulcers, biopsy revealed moderate mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria, ZN stain was negative. Based on this, a diagnosis of Crohn disease was considered and oral prednisolone (50 mg/d) and azathioprine (100 mg/d) were started. After a month of therapy, the patient presented with proximal myopathy, bleeding per rectum, and peri-anal ulceration, fever, and cervical lymphadenopathy. A fine needle aspiration and biopsy of the cervical lymph node revealed histoplasmosis. Perianal ulcer biopsy also revealed histoplasmosis. Colonoscopy revealed rectosigmoid ulceration with stricture, biopsy also revealed histoplasmosis. Serological test for immunodeficiency virus was negative. A computerized tomographic scan showed bilateral adrenal enlargement, and thickening of the ileocecal junction. With a diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis in a patient with Crohn disease on immunosuppressive treatment, prednisolone and azathioprine were withheld, treatment with liposomal amphotericin B started, and continued for the next 21 days; his fever subsided, lymph node regressed, perianal ulcer showed healthy granulation tissue. At this stage, itraconazole was started. Conclusion In patients with inflammatory bowel disease including Crohn disease on immunosuppressive treatment such as corticosteroids, azathioprine, and biologicals, though opportunistic infections like tuberculosis, cytomegalovirus, coccidiomycosis have been reported, 1, 2, 3 disseminated histoplasmosis has not been widely published in adult population. 4 An early recognition and appropriate treatment may be life-saving for such infection.",

Finally, the patient was treated with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole for 1 week, and a repeat endoscopy showed improvement of erythema, along with clearance of Sarcina organisms. Review of reported cases including ours suggests that Sarcina is more frequently an innocent bystander rather than a pathogenic organism. However, given its association with life threatening illness in two reported cases, it may be prudent to treat with antibiotics and antiulcer therapy, until further understanding is achieved.

Multiple attempts of endotherapy for gastric varices failed and BRTO was needed. Fifty-three-year-old diabetic lady presented with abdominal pain radiating to back and an episode of hematemesis in 2017 September. An upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy revealed large esophageal varices for which band ligation was done. On further evaluation CT abdomen showed retroperitoneal infiltrating mass encasing main PV and causing narrowing of celiac trunk, SMV and CBD. Biopsy suggestive of retroperitoneal metastatic adenocarcinoma. Patient was started on chemotherapy in December 2017. In December 2017, patient had yellowish discolorations of eyes, suggest biliary obstruction for which she underwent ERCP stenting. Patient had repeated episode of upper GI bleeding in spite of multiple sessions of glue injections in gastric varices. An initial effort to do balloon retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) was abandoned. In June 2018, after 2 more episodes of gastric variceal bleeding, attempt to perform BRTO via femoral route failed due to failure to cannulate gastro-renal shunt. Repeat BRTO was performed via right internal jugular vein and sclerosant was injected in gastric varices. Post-procedure patient did not have hematemesis. Discussion Nineteen percent of patients with gastric varices require alternative management inform of BRTO1. In our case retroperitoneal mass encasing portal vein led to gastric varices which responded well to BRTO. Gastric varices due to portal vein block is extremely rare.",

Investigations can be extensive, but a thorough clinical history and physical examination can provide valuable clues to appropriate diagnostic workup. Case presentation A 64-year-old woman presented with non-specific upper abdominal pain, non-bloody diarrhea and 10% weight loss over 6 months. A history of peptic-ulcer surgery came to light after noticing an upper abdominal scar during physical examination. Her BMI was 12.8 kg/m2. Upper GI endoscopy (UGIE), done for the abdominal pain, showed a gastrojejunostomy on the posterior wall with some feculent material draining from a suspicious opening, surrounded by mucosal nodularity, at entry into the efferent loop. Suspecting a gastrojejunocolic fistula (GJCF), barium enema was attempted, however since patient could not hold the enema, the imaging failed. Even the colonoscopy did not show any fistulous opening. Contrast-enhanced CT abdomen with an oral contrast also failed to demonstrate any fistulous tract. Meanwhile, the biopsies that were taken from the suspicious fistulous opening (during the UGIE) showed colonic mucosa with colonic glands. At a re-look UGIE, the endoscope could gently be negotiated across the fistulous tract into the colon, confirming GJCF. She has been advised corrective surgery after appropriate nutritional build-up. Conclusion With a decrease in surgery for peptic ulcer disease, its complications, such as of much GJCF, are becoming uncommon. However, GJCF from the previously popular surgery may manifest as a late complication today and have high morbidity and mortality of left untreated. Hence a high index of suspicion is necessary to make an early diagnosis for better outcome.",
