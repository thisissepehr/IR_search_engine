Associated with suppliers and in-house production and distribution are possible disruptions due to political risk and 'acts of god' or 'acts of man' in terms of war or terror. Associated with the demand side are risks pertaining to unanticipated changes in demand possibly stemming from loss of reputation for quality, from loss of technological or design competitive edge, from unpredictable changes in customer preferences, and even from a worldwide recession.

The impact of these risks is potentially huge, possibly threatening even the organization's viability. It is hard to determine 'probabilities' in these situations and one has to deal with possibilities instead. One way to mitigate capacity-, demand-, and environmental regulation-related risks is to use scenario planning as, for instance, with a polyvinylchloride manufacturer (Sodhi, 2003) . In contrast to risks requiring strategic decisions, other risks require mitigation through tactical planning decisions with a shorter decision horizon of anywhere from a few weeks to a few months.

In addition, just as there are many metrics for measuring efficiency-related performance in a company, we need to devise appropriate metrics for risk exposure and risk performance.
