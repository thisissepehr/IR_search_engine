Consequently, even with commitment to information-sharing, through collaborative working groups and interdepartmental committees, inter-sectoral co-operation has rarely delivered the outcomes promised. Many recognise that integrationist reforms are likely to promote more effective cross-sectoral collaboration (Coker et al. 2011; Manlove et al. 2016) , and OH opinion leaders are now advocating for the establishment of a supporting OH infrastructure comprised of: complex, polycentric organizational structures \u2026 [that] rely on multiple, strong connections and coordinated activities across sectors (R\u00fcegg et al. 2017) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 189, "end": 200, "text": "(Baum 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 201, "end": 215, "text": "Degeling 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 245, "end": 264, "text": "(R\u00fcegg et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 643, "end": 658, "text": "(Degeling 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1249, "end": 1268, "text": "(Coker et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1269, "end": 1289, "text": "Manlove et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1539, "end": 1558, "text": "(R\u00fcegg et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Against this background, there is evidence that enthusiasm for OH in Australia is genuine rather than symbolic, as governments in recent years have moved towards aggregating responsibility for agriculture and environmental health under 'biosecurity'. Initiatives such as the Australian Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy and Hendra Virus Interagency Technical Working Group are significant attempts to achieve collaboration between human and animal health sectors. This survey showed that there is considerable agreement among human and animal health practitioners and policymakers, including about the nature and scale of barriers to effective OH collaboration and the need for further work to explore their potential impacts. This suggests that implementation of an OH strategy, based on inter-sectoral co-operation, is eminently feasible.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The initial response to participant invitations was moderate, which was gratifying, given that our invitation was unsolicited. Retention of participants over successive rounds was also moderate, and the balance between members of different sectors remained constant. Because participation across different sectoral roles and jurisdictions remained relatively heterogeneous throughout the survey (Table 1) , we believe the risk of selection bias due to participant withdrawal is minimal. Moreover, allowing participants to express their views and comment on each other's interpretation, via open-ended free text questions, over multiple survey rounds increased the reliability of the study and improved the validity of the results.
