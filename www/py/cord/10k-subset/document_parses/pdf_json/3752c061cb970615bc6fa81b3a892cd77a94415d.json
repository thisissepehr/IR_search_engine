We sought to determine the probability of weaning and overall survival of cancer patients requiring long-term mechanical ventilation in a specialized weaning unit. Methods: A single-institution retrospective review of patients requiring mechanical ventilation outside of a critical care setting from 2008 to 2012 and from January 1 to December 31, 2018, was performed. Demographic and clinical data were recorded, including cancer specifics, comorbidities, treatments, and outcomes. Overall survival was determined using the Kaplan-Meier approach. Time to weaning was analyzed using the cumulative incidence function, with death considered a competing risk. Prognostic factors were evaluated for use in prospective evaluations of weaning protocols. Results: Between 2008 and 2012, 122 patients required mechanical ventilation outside of a critical care setting with weaning as a goal of care. The cumulative incidence of weaning after discharge from the intensive care unit was 42% at 21 days, 49% at 30 days, 58% at 60 days, 61% at 90 days, and 61% at 120 days. The median survival was 0.16 years (95% CI, 0.12 to 0.33) for those not weaned and 1.05 years (95% CI, 0.60 to 1.34) for those weaned. Overall survival at 1 year and 2 years was 52 and 32% among those weaned and 16 and 9% among those not weaned. During 2018, 36 patients at our institution required mechanical ventilation outside of a critical care setting, with weaning as a goal of care. Overall, with a median follow-up of 140 days (range, 0-425 days; average, 141 days), 25% of patients requiring long-term mechanical ventilation (9 of 36) are alive. Conclusions: Cancer patients can be weaned from long-term mechanical ventilation, even after prolonged periods of support. Implementation of a resource-intensive weaning program did not improve rates of successful weaning. No clear time on mechanical ventilation could be identified beyond which weaning was unprecedented.

In 2010, the surgical advanced care unit (SACU) was created. Under the SACU program, all patients treated with prolonged mechanical ventilation after discharge from the ICU were transferred to the care of the General Medicine Service.

Comparisons of overall survival by group were made using the log-rank test. Cox regression was used for univariable and multivariable analyses to estimate the hazard of death based on weaning statuses, with adjustment for demographic and clinical variables. Factors included care in the SACU, age on initiation of ventilatory support outside of the ICU, sex, cancer status (active versus no evidence of disease), tumor histology (solid versus liquid), and number of days on mechanical ventilation while in the ICU. Time to weaning, defined as the number of months between ICU discharge and first documentation of successful weaning, was analyzed using a competing risks approach. Death without having been weaned was treated as a competing risk event. Cumulative incidence functions for each competing event were calculated using competing risks methodology [4] . Fine and Gray's competing risk regressions for the subhazard ratio [5] were used to evaluate any patient, tumor, or treatment characteristic that was associated with the incidence of weaning.

[7] , in 2004, reported a 1-year overall survival of 58%. Bigatello [8] , in 2007, reported a similar 1-year overall survival, of 61%. Similar outcomes have been reported in more recent studies: in a retrospective multicenter review from 2012, Carson et al. [9] Fig. 1 Overall survival of weaned and not weaned cancer patients. Weaning status was entered as a time-dependent covariate. All patients were discharged from ICU while on mechanical ventilation and thus were not weaned at ICU discharge; the patient's status was changed to \"weaned\" at the date of the first recorded weaning Efforts to improve long-term outcomes after prolonged mechanical ventilation have been reported. Daly et al. [10] reported a prospective randomized trial of patients cared for either by a disease management team (DMT)-including nurse practitioners, a geriatrician, and a pulmonologist-or by the primary service alone. Care by the DMT extended to 2 months after hospital discharge. Unfortunately, neither mortality, need for rehospitalization, nor time to rehospitalization was significantly improved in the DMT care group. This emphasizes the recalcitrance and intractability of the medical problems experienced by this patient population. Similarly, for the patients that compose our study population, at first, care was directed by the original admitting service, with weaning directed by the Critical Service as a consult service. In 2010, we created the SACU, which consolidated all patients requiring mechanical ventilation outside of an ICU to one floor with dedicated ventilator rooms, including monitoring, and a cadre of nurse practitioners who were physically present on the floor 24-7. All mechanically ventilated patients were transferred to the General Medicine Service, which coordinated care during daily rounds (7 days a week) with representatives from nursing (both registered nurses and SACU-dedicated nurse practitioners) as well as Pulmonary Medicine, Respiratory Therapy, Rehabilitation Medicine (i.e., Physical and Occupational Therapy), and Social Work Services. The outcomes of patients cared for in the SACU, despite this coordination of care and expenditure of resources, were not significantly different from the outcomes of patients cared for before the creation of the SACU. It is possible that our weaning program was more effective than our data suggest because of other factors that are difficult to account for. For example, during this same time, the Memorial Hospital ICU implemented multiple other care plans directed at improving the likelihood of weaning while in the ICU, including sedation holidays [11] and mobilization while on mechanical ventilatory support [12] . It is likely that these programs led to earlier successful weaning of more patients while they were admitted to the ICU and that the remaining patients, who were discharged from the ICU to SACU care while on mechanical ventilation, represented a sicker patient population with more recalcitrant medical conditions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 351, "end": 354, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 419, "end": 422, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 609, "end": 612, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1046, "end": 1050, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2976, "end": 2980, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 3038, "end": 3042, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our study provides information on the likelihood of weaning and on survival for cancer patients requiring long-term mechanical ventilation. It is our hope that this information can be provided to patients and their families to assist in clinical decision-making. Specifically, with the goal of guiding care in mind, we examined whether an inflection point for success in weaning associated with the duration of weaning might be found. For example, an early period characterized by a high success Fig. 2 The cumulative incidence of weaning after ICU discharge and of the competing risk of death without weaning. The cumulative incidence of weaning was 42% at 21 days after ICU discharge Time-varying covariate: weaning status changed from \"not weaned\" to \"weaned\" on the date of first documentation of weaning post-ICU discharge rate in weaning might be followed by a plateau in weaning success, such that transition to a care plan for longterm ventilatory support could be made. No such inflection point seems apparent, and if it does exist, it seems likely to occur between 45 and 60 days (Fig. 2) . Our study also does not provide what may be more important information: the likely quality of life during a patient's remaining life. Multiple studies have noted diminished quality of life [7, [13] [14] [15] , including persistent significant cognitive deficiencies [13, 16] , after care that included prolong mechanical ventilation. In general, these outcomes are not anticipated by patients and their caregivers. Cox et al. [17] found that, at the time of initiation of ventilation, 93% of patients and caregivers expected the patient to be alive at 1 year, 71% expected good functional status, and 83% expected a good quality of life. After a year, only 56% of patients were alive, and of these survivors only 9% had a good functional status and 33% had a good quality of life.
