One of the main reasons of disease survival is diversity of vectors and parasites in different malaria regions that have their specific features, behaviour and biology. Therefore, specific regional strategies are necessary for successful control of malaria. One of the tools that needs to be developed for elimination and prevention of reintroduction of malaria is a vaccine that interrupt malaria transmission (VIMTs). VIMT is a broad concept that should be adjusted to the biological characteristics of the disease in each region. One type of VIMT is a vector-based vaccine that affects the sexual stage of Plasmodium life cycle. According to recent studies, the aminopeptidase N-1 of Anopheles gambiae (AgAPN-1) is as a potent vector-based VIMT with considerable inhibition activity against the sexual stage of Plasmodium parasite.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Systems for rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3\u02b9-RACE) and genome walking methods were used for sequence determination of apn-1 gene from Anopheles stephensi and distinct bioinformatics software were used for structural analysis.

Recombinant AsAPN-1 was purified under the hybrid condition and its biological activity was assayed.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Background Despite the impressive progresses in medical sciences, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) report in 2018, malaria is still as one of the most significant infectious diseases in the world and there were 219 million new cases with increment of about 3.5 million cases over 2017 [1, 2] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 301, "end": 304, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 305, "end": 307, "text": "2]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The severity of the disease is directly related to the species of Plasmodium and the geographical dispersion and proportion of Anopheles. There are about 30 species of Anopheles, which are responsible for transmission of malaria across the world [3] . One of the most considerable challenge in malaria control is the diversity of the vector and parasite species in different endemic regions which means distinct strategies must be considered for each geographical region [4] . For instance, Anopheles gambiae is the main malaria vector in sub-Saharan of Africa, while Anopheles stephensi is the most prevalent vector which is spread from the east of Africa (Djibouti and Ethiopia) to the south regions of China [5] . In addition, resistance to insecticides and drugs increases the complexity of malaria treatment and control [6] [7] [8] . Moreover, proximity with special endemic malaria regions affects the malaria control progress and, therefore, needs more considerations to achieve the final goal. For example, Iran which is in elimination phase is a neighbour of Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are categorized in the \"Control Phase\" with high prevalence of malaria. This situation might be established in many parts of the world and may lead to the failure of the malaria elimination goals of the United Nations by 2030 [9] . According to the malEra guidelines, vaccines are one of the main tools for malaria control and with regards to the progress in the elimination programme; specific types of vaccines should be considered for each country. Development of the vaccines that interrupt malaria transmission (VIMTs) was emphasized by the vaccine consultative group for countries that have passed the pre-elimination step and have proceeded to the global goal [10] . VIMTs are divided into various types; one type is the classical transmissionblocking vaccine that blocks the sexual parasite development by targeting the required effector molecules in the vector, including mosquito-based transmission-blocking vaccines with targets such as Anopheles gambiae aminopeptidase N-1 (AgAPN-1) [11] , CPBAg1 (Carboxy Peptidase B1) [12, 13] , Trypsin [14] , saglin [15] , FREP 1 [16, 17] , and SGS1 [18] . APN-1 is a candidate molecule for which the blocking efficacy against Plasmodium falciparum in An. gambiae has been confirmed [19] . Given the fact that Jacalin prevents ookinete attachment by masking the glycan ligands on the surface of midgut epithelial cells, Dinglasan et al. used affinity chromatography to identify its receptor on the midgut epithelial cells of An. gambiae. Some glycoproteins, such as APN-1, are receptors for the lectin-similar structures of ookinete that trigger the attachment of ookinetes to the internal side of the epithelium and are essential for preceding the sexual development of parasite in the mosquito midgut [13, 16, 20] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 246, "end": 249, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 471, "end": 474, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 711, "end": 714, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 825, "end": 828, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 829, "end": 832, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 833, "end": 836, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1326, "end": 1329, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1767, "end": 1771, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2095, "end": 2099, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2132, "end": 2136, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2137, "end": 2140, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2151, "end": 2155, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2165, "end": 2169, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2179, "end": 2183, "text": "[16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2184, "end": 2187, "text": "17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2199, "end": 2203, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2332, "end": 2336, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2852, "end": 2856, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2857, "end": 2860, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2861, "end": 2864, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Therefore, Dinglasan et al. used AgAPN-1 as a TBV candidate and their results showed that it can inhibit the sexual development of P. falciparum with 100% efficacy (at ~ 10 \u00b5g/ml specific IgG).

Immunoinformatics analysis showed that the length of the in silico predicted antigenic peptides are almost 9-14 residues and it is expected that the processing and presenting of AsAPN-1 on MHC-II groove be done well in antigen processing cells of immune system. Among the predicted antigenic peptides of AsAPN-1, there are only one fragments that their lengths are 27 residues and these results propose a good presentation of AsAPN-1 to immune system (Table 5) . Therefore, peptides might not be able to bind the MHC groove in suitable and effective form. It is interesting that peptide 9, which was identified and confirmed by Dinglasan et al. as the shortest and best protective peptide in the experimental assays, acquired good scores for presenting with the common MHC-II alleles in Iran [21] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 274, "end": 278, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 319, "end": 323, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 472, "end": 476, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1271, "end": 1275, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 930, "end": 939, "text": "(Table 5)", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Genetic diversity of the MHC plays an central role in antigen recognition and strength of immune responses [47] . Each individual has specific alleles which may be different in distinct geographical regions [48] . Therefore, for designing an effective recombinant immunogenic vaccine, considering and evaluating the prevalence of an allele in the target area is crucial [49] . Draheim et al. study disclosed that the presentation of malaria antigen by MHC-II on dendritic cell is particularly important in induction of an effective immune response [50] . According to the in silico analysis, it is predicted that nine antigenic peptides have the best scores for perfect processing and presentation ability with the DQA10102-DQB10602 and DR B1 alleles and those could be considered as candidates for developing a recombinant subunit vaccine (Additional file 3) [51] . A study on Fula ethnic group (the largest ethnic groups in the Sahel and West Africa) showed that the presented antigens by DQA-DQB are associated with the higher levels of antibody production [51] . With regard to the geographical location and ethnic genome polymorphisms, prediction of the immune response before any laboratory analysis is critical. Herein, HLA-DRB1 allele which is common among the Caucasian and sub-Saharan African populations and has been evaluated in the Dinglasan et al. study, has the best AsAPN-1 bioactivity assay. Bioactivity assay of AsAPN-1 was performed in the presence of the 1,10-phenanthroline as the specific inhibitor, l-leucine p-nitroanilide as specific substrate and Streptomyces griseus aminopeptidase (Sigma) as positive control and standard. Bioactivity assay revealed that the recombinant AsAPN-1 could degrade the specific substrate and 1,10-phenanthroline (10 \u03bcM) as the metalloproteases inhibitor is able to bind specifically to the active site of recombinant AsAPN-1and disrupt its enzymatic activity. Optical density was measured at 405 nm after 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after the start of reaction predicted binding efficiency in comparison to the other examined MHC alleles in our analysis. Furthermore, analysis using pyDockWEB and NetMHCII revealed that AsAPN-1 is well processed and presented by the common MHC-II alleles in Iran and potentially could be a suitable candidate molecule for vaccine development. In addition, NetMHCII scores and statistical data revealed that AsAPN-1 is better processed and presented by DP, DQ and DR alleles in comparison with AgAPN-1. With regard to the presence of An. stephensi in Iran and neighbouring countries and the frequency of the mentioned alleles in this region, this seems that there is a natural adaptation between the target antigen and immune system. For achieving the best functional and native structure of the recombinant protein, it is necessary to evaluate the occurrence of PTM such as glycosylation, especially in vaccine candidate molecules. These modifications are highly sequence specific and dependent to the arrangement of residues in the primary structure of proteins [20] . Results of the PTM prediction revealed that AsAPN-1 could be modified by glycosylation at three residues in V2, N148, and N589 positions. It is noticeable that two of them have been located in N-terminal of AsAPN-1 and it should be considered that peptide 9, which is the best and short protective epitope in the Dinglasan et al. study, has been located in N-terminal region. Therefore, suitable host must be selected for recombinant expression of the target protein according to the predicted PTMs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 107, "end": 111, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 207, "end": 211, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 370, "end": 374, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 548, "end": 552, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 860, "end": 864, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1060, "end": 1064, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 3052, "end": 3056, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Antigen stability is an important determining factor for potency and efficacy of a vaccine candidate molecule. Variation in antigenic epitopes of a protein would not lead to the production of effective neutralizing antibodies by immune system.

In silico analysis of the present study revealed that our target protein has a stable and rigid structure, which is suitable for recombinant antigen production except the first and second residues which are located in the N-terminal region and have variable structure. It is predicted that there are three variable regions in the C-terminal region. Therefore, according to this point and the results of Dinglasan et al. it is reasonable to consider N-terminal part, including peptide 9, for developing an efficient vaccine. Additionally, this location is represented by the most common MHC-II alleles in the selected area in this study and possibly other neighbor countries in the Middle East region. In addition, several previous investigations evaluated the protection efficacy of different segments of AgAPN1 [52] . According to the findings of Dinglasan et al. residues at positions 758 and 821 are the ookinete attachment sites that their blocking with antibodies could be resulted in inhibition of the sexual P. falciparum development in the mosquito midgut [53] . Moreover, based on the performed peptide mapping by Armistead et al., it was found that the produced antibodies against the peptide 9 have the best inhibitory effects on ookinete attachment. In another study, Atkinson et al. performed peptide mapping which showed that the size of epitopes were 60 to 200 amino acids long. Their study revealed that some peptides, despite are on the surface, did not have the suitable performance, and only peptide 9, which has been located at residues 173-194, had the perfect inhibitory feature.
