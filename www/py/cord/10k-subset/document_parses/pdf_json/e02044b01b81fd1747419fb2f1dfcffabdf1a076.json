Conversely, mirabegron 50 mg (Mir50) and mirabegron 100 mg (Mir100) were not associated with an increased risk of TEAEs when compared to placebo (OR: 0.94; p=0.32 and OR:0.97; p=0.31, respectively) In particular, Mir50 was not associated with an increased risk of hypertension (OR: 1.02; p=0.90), while with mirabegron 100 mg this risk was slightly increased (OR: 1.41; p=0.08) in comparison to placebo. Also the risk of cardiac arrhythmia was not significantly increased over placebo with Mir50 (OR: 1.0; p=1.00), but slightly with Mir100 (OR: 2.18; p=0.06). The risk of dry mouth was statistically greater for Tol (OR: 2.97; p<0.001) vs. placebo, but also vs. Mir50 and Mir100 (OR: 2.49; p<0.00001, and OR: 2.43; p<0.001, respectively). The discontinuation rate due to adverse events was not greater for Mir50 (OR: 0.97; p=0.80), Mir100 (OR: 0.89; p=0.63) or Tol (OR:1.42;p=0.12) vs placebo. (Figure 1 ). Interpretation of results Results showed a better TEAEs profile of \u03b2\u2083-adrenoceptor agonist compared to Tol, that can be explained by the different selectiveness of the drugs. \u03b2\u2083-adrenoceptor receptors are present in bladder and adipose tissue, while muscarinic receptors are well represented in many organs, leading to a higher rate of TEAEs in the Tol arm compared to mirabegron. Mirabegron's adverse effects, like hypertension can be explained to the intrinsic alfa-agonist activity of the drug that is concentration related, so higher dosages can bring higher rates of hypertension. Dry-mouth sensation can be also related to pharmacodynamics, but the adrenergic component is not as predominant as the muscarinic one on salivary glands, so that's why Tol results more bothersome. The discontinuation rate due to adverse effects shows that almost every drug is well-tolerated, independently to the TEAEs. The reason can be that the OAB/Storage LUTS are usually more bothersome than TEAEs, allowing a better compliance for the patients.",

For Mir50 and Mir100, the risk of TEAEs and the discontinuation rate due to TEAEs is not superior to placebo. However, Mir100 is associated with a slight increase in hypertension and cardiac arrhythmia. Conversely, Tol was found associated with an increased risk of overall TEAEs vs placebo, but not with treatment discontinuation due to TEAEs. These findings should be considered when evaluating the risk-benefits of prescribing drugs for OAB/storage LUTS. Study design, materials and methods It was an observational study in one maternity hospital. We used data from medical records and a self-report questionnaire. Patients' approvals were obtained before participation to the study. Clinical characteristics for calculating jelovsek's probabilities of developing UI and FI and birth issues (instrumental extractions, perineal tears) were collected. For each participating woman, we calculated her UI and FI risks using antenatal data before delivery: maternal age, prepregancy BMI and predelivery BMI, ethnical origin, urinary incontinence symptoms before and during pregnancy, planned mode of delivery We studied the distribution of our participants' scores. For each score value, we calculated how many women had an equal or upper score. This represents the theoretical number of elective cesareans if Jelovsek's nomograms was used to determine the mode of delivery at this level of risk. We did likewise with all score's values and create a curve.Two curves were drawn: one for UI and one for FI. With these curves, we could estimate the number of elective prophylactic cesarean deliveries depending on perineal risk accepted by women. We also asked women if they would accept to randomize their mode of delivery. We performed a descriptive statistical analysis using R statistical software.",

Prediction of a woman's individual probability of developing UI or FI after her first delivery can appear valuable. It might help women who want to choose their routes of delivery. Use of Jelovsek's prediction models for postpartum incontinence in common practice would probably lead to a significant increase of elective cesarean deliveries on demand in an obstetrical low risk population. For example, if women decide that a probability of 20% of FI is unacceptable, it would lead to increase the C-section rate by 10%. If women choose a threshold value for urinary incontinence as 40%, it would lead to increase the C-section rate by 19%. Prognostic value of Jelovsek's models has an area under the curve less than 0, 70. It appears for us insufficient for daily clinical practice (it gets wrong in 30% of case).

Results 206 overactive bladder patients entered the study, 176 females (85%) and 30 males (15%). Patients were aged 23 -89 (mean age 62.9\u00b112.43), males 30-78 (63.4\u00b112.14) and females 23-89 (62.8\u00b112.52). 178 patients (86%) switched from anticholinergics (108 due to lack of efficiency, 66 due to lack of tolerance, 4 for other reasons). Significant difference by age in the reason for therapy switch was found. Patients up to 60 years tend to switch due to lack of tolerance (52%). Patients over 60 years tend to switch for lack of efficacy of previous anticholinergic treatment (70%). 75 patients (36%) were up to 60 years, 9 males (12%) and 66 females (88%), and 131 patients (64%) were over 60 years, 21 males (16%) and 110 females (84%), at the beginning of the study. 126 patients (persistence in the study was 61.2%) finished the whole course of the study. 80 patients (39%) terminated the study prematurely -16 males (20%) and 64 females (80%), 27 patients (34%) were up to 60 years and 53 patients (66%) were over 60 years. 6 patients up to 60 years and 22 patients over 60 years terminated the study due to lack of efficacy. 12 patients up to 60 years and 7 over 60 years terminated the study due to the lack of tolerance. The remaining 43 patients dropped the study from other reasons (lost-follow-up, gravidity, disease, hospitalization, etc.). All the characteristics observed improved significantly within the 1.5 year's period of the study for all the patients who finished the study as planned. Slight worsening of observed quality of life patterns was observed between M12 and M18, but this was not accompanied by change in objective micturition diary patterns. Of the three age breakpoints the 60 year break point was found the best for evaluation of differences. There were no significant differences between patients up to 70 years and over 70 years. There were still some significant differences between patients up to 65 years and over 65 years, but the difference was statistically strongest between patients up to 60 years and over 60 years. It seems that the greatest effect in perception of quality of life lies between 60 and 65 years. Treatment development as measured by differences between D1 and M18 seems to be always slightly better for patients over 60 years either in objective characteristics from micturition diary or in quality of life characteristics TS-VAS, UB-VAS, PPBC and OAB. Differences in TS-VAS, urgencies gr.3 and urgencies gr.3+4 were found to be significant by age. TS-VAS improved by 5,4 from M3 to M18 for patients over 60 years and by 7,3 for patients up to 60 years. Number of urgencies gr. 3 decreased by 0,8 in patients up to 60 years and 2,0 in patients over 60 years.

Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors like sildenafil (Viagra\u00ae), which are clinically used to treat erectile dysfunction, have been found to also alleviate LUTS. The ability of PDE5 inhibitors to directly relax smooth muscle has been described [1] , however, a complete understanding of its action on the bladder remains unclear. We are investigating the effects of sildenafil on several potential mechanisms involved in peripheral control of bladder function. In this study, the effects of sildenafil on nerve-mediated contractions of the isolated mouse bladder, and neuronal neurotransmitter release, were characterised. A comprehensive description of how sildenafil reduces detrusor contractile function should give insight into pathology of bladder diseases and suggest a potential therapeutic role of PDE5 inhibitors in their treatment.",

Contractures were generated by carbachol (CCh, 1 \u03bcM) added to the superfusate. Nerve-mediated contractions (tetrodotoxin-sensitive) were generated by electrical field stimulation (EFS: 0.1 ms pulses, 1-24 Hz, 3-s train every 90-s). Contraction amplitude was normalised for tissue preparation weight (mN.mg -1 ). Forcefrequency relationships were used to determine maximum tension (Tmax), the frequency to attain Tmax/2 (f1/2, Hz), and the ratio at low and near maximum frequencies (T2/20). The quantity of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) released (pmoles) into the superfusate during EFS was measured directly using a firefly luciferin-luciferase assay. A protocol of pelvic nerve stimulation using an arterially-perfused mouse model was used [2] to investigate nerve-mediated bladder pressure changes in situ.

Sildenafil (20 \u03bcM) also reduced EFS-stimulated contractions, but also significantly increased the f1/2 to the right, from 3.31\u00b10.47 to 7.56\u00b10.92 Hz in young mice (p<0.01, n=8), and from 1.92\u00b10.67 to 7.65\u00b10.42 Hz in aged mice (p<0.01, n=5) - Figure 1 . T2/20 values were also significantly decreased upon the addition of sildenafil, from 0.33\u00b10.06 to 0.10\u00b10.02 in young mice (p<0.01, n=8), and from 0.61\u00b10.14 to 0.08\u00b10.01 in aged mice (p<0.05, n=5). These results show that sildenafil reduced EFS-stimulated contractions more at low frequencies, compared to high frequencies. \u03b1,\u03b2me-ATP (10 \u03bcM), an ATP analogue, was used to desensitise purinergic receptors and leave only acetylcholine-mediated EFS contractions -sildenafil (20 \u03bcM) had no significant effects on Tmax, f1/2, or T2/20 (p>0.05, n=6). By contrast, in the presence of atropine (1 \u03bcM), to inhibit acetylcholine (ACh)-mediated EFS contractions, sildenafil (20 \u03bcM) significantly reduced Tmax from 0.79\u00b10.11 to 0.64\u00b10.12 mN.mg -1 , in comparison to the effects of atropine alone (p<0.05, n=6). Sildenafil also significantly reduced ATP release during EFS-stimulated contractions in young mice (n=8); from 70.1\u00b112.3 pmoles to 38.5\u00b18.5 pmoles at 2 Hz stimulation (p<0.001), and from 124.6\u00b120.2 pmoles to 36.6\u00b19.2 pmoles at 20 Hz stimulation (p<0.01) - Figure 2 . Pelvic nerve stimulation in the arterially-perfused mouse model generated a frequency-dependent increase in in situ bladder pressure recordings at 1-24Hz stimulation, and preliminary results demonstrate relaxation of nerve-mediated whole bladder pressure movements by sildenafil in situ, which is comparable to the effects in vitro. Interpretation of results Sildenafil reduced the magnitude of nerve-mediated contractions in detrusor from young and aged mice. Although it reduced agonist-induced contractions, the data on nerve-mediated contractions suggests an additional effect on neurotransmitter release or its down-stream effects. Nerve-mediated contractions are dominated by ATP release at low frequencies, and ACh release at higher frequencies [3] . The fact that sildenafil had no action on ACh-dependent contractions (in the presence of \u03b1,\u03b2me-ATP) suggests that the local ACh concentration is less than 10 \u03bcM, as it did suppress the CCh contracture. The predominant effect of sildenafil at low frequencies, the blockade of atropine-resistant contractions and its almost complete abolition of nerve-mediated ATP release all suggest that the agent has a specific effect on ATP neurotransmitter release or at least its persistence in the nerve-muscle junction. The particular pathways whereby this action is mediated are yet to be determined.",

SNS test phase is statistically more effective at treating OAB symptoms in females than PTNS. This is identified by analysing the data in a number of ways. SNS has a significantly higher overall responder rate, it also has a higher responder rate within more OAB symptoms and has the greater percentage reduction of symptoms than PTNS. This study has generated new evidence within this cohort. However findings should be viewed with caution due to the studies retrospective design, lack of randomisation and small sample size. Findings from this pilot study may justify further evaluation as NICE (2) recommend further research into the effectiveness and long term effectiveness of third line management for OAB sufferers. A multi site study utilising a similar design would represent a way to collate large data sets that can be easily accessed and data is likely to be already available at sites that provide either treatment for their patients. Study limitations: This study does not take into account why patients are offered PTNS rather than SNS. These cohorts are likely to have different baseline characteristics, not examined within this study, which may introduce bias in favour of SNS treatment. If a future multi site study is undertaken additional baseline characteristic data including co morbidities, patient mobility status, and cognitive ability should be analysed as these factors are likely to influence clinician and patient treatment choice and treatment outcomes. The ability to compare these results to other studies examining effectiveness for either treatment is poor. This is due to a lack of standardisation regarding treatment protocols, procedures and outcome measures within both treatments.",

            "text": "Hypothesis / aims of study Running is a popular sport and recreation activity with diverse benefits for the individual health. Yet many women reduce their participation in such sports activities because of the embarrassing condition of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) (1) . A high prevalence of 41% has been found in female elite athletes (2) with the highest prevalence in sports involving impact activities. Up to now the main focus of research on pelvic floor muscle (PFM) function has been on voluntary and concentric contractions. Nevertheless many activities of daily life that typically elicit SUI such as running require involuntary and fast reflexive PFM contractions. Data about reflex activity and contraction characteristics of the PFMs during impact loading are still inadequate. High PFM EMGactivation during running in young continent female subjects has been demonstrated in one study (3) . The aim of this study was to investigate and compare pelvic floor muscle activity in continent and incontinent women in a wider age band during running at three different speeds and thereby elucidate contraction characteristics of the pelvic floor during impact. Study design, materials and methods A cross-sectional, exploratory design was applied and a sample of 50 women between 18 and 60 years was recruited. Screening for inclusion was performed by an urogynaecologist and SUI was diagnosed according to the ICIQ-UIsf questionnaire. Surface electromyographic (EMG) activity from the PFMs during running on a treadmill was recorded with a vaginal probe, bandpass filtered (20-500 Hz) and computed by RMS-algorithm. EMG was measured during 10 seconds at the speeds 7, 11 and 15 km/h. Data from 30 ms before to 150 ms after heel-strike were RMS-parameterised to time intervals of 30 ms. The reference value set as 100% for EMG normalisation was calculated as the mean of the peak values of activity during two maximum voluntary contractions (MVC). The EMG activity onset threshold (ON) was considered as the mean plus two standard deviations of the filtered and rectified EMG during the 30 seconds rest.",

Running-like stimuli (e.g. a few steps) should therefore not only be regarded with caution due to its contribution to the manifestation of SUI, but also more positively as a potential training stimulus, leading to reflex activity of the PFMs. Running training stimuli may serve as a beneficial complement to a PFM training rationale, leading to reflex activity of the PFMspelvic floor muscles, when used in sense of power training methodology.",

Currently, this involves using vaginal pessaries, mainly ring-shaped. Existing pessaries are reusable only devices which require medical assistance for insertion and removal, are used for long periods and are associated with discomfort, pain, bleeding, vaginal wall pressure trauma, discharge and smell. A new disposable vaginal device for the management of POP was developed. The device is inserted vaginally in very small dimensions within an applicator, by the user herself, at her home environment. Within the vagina the device opens to become a ring of up to 91 mm (various sizes). Following insertion, the applicator is removed and discarded and the device may remain within the vagina for up to seven days, when the user pulls a string and the device collapses and is comfortably removed from the vagina in small dimensions, for disposal. The user may insert the next device immediately or later, at her will. The aim of the study was to evaluate effectiveness (objective & subjective) and safety of the new disposable vaginal device, when used as intended by the user herself at her home environment.",

This hypothesis has been supported by the discovery of major injuries to the levator ani muscle (LAM) occurring in one third of women with anatomic POP (aPOP), and exclusively occurring after vaginal deliveries (3) . However, the fact that most women who deliver vaginally will not develop aPOP, that most women with aPOP does not have major LAM injuries, and that caesarean delivery is not fully protective for the development of POP indicate that we are still far from understanding the complex aetiology of POP and how childbearing interacts with the pelvic floor.",

The written survey included demographic information, the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory Short Form (PFDI-20), the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I), and questions related to satisfaction and sexual function following the index operation, as well as complications and subsequent surgeries. Those participants who presented for pelvic examination were reimbursed $20 for transportation costs. Descriptive analyses were performed to characterize the sample. The primary outcome of interest was re-operation for mesh-related complication, and logistic regression was used to identify associated factors. Factors associated with mesh-related re-operation on univariate analysis with p-value less than .2 were included in the backward linear regression model.

Seventy-nine percent (127/161) had undergone prior hysterectomy and 56% (90/161) previous prolapse repair. Table  1 describes the mesh placement for the 161 surgeries included in the chart review, of which 146 utilized macroporous, monofilamentous, non-absorbable mesh (type 1) and 9 (6%) involved a mesh kit. Overall, 33/161 (21%) women underwent mesh-related re-operation. Factors associated with re-operation for mesh-related complication are outlined in table 2. The most common indication for re-operation was vaginal mesh extrusion (n=25). The overall rate of mesh-related complication was 32% (52/161); 28% (45/161) had mesh extrusion into the vagina and 1% (2/161) had mesh erosion into the bladder (1) or rectum (1) . Vaginal extrusions were treated with local estrogen (n=11), office excision (n=8), or surgical excision (n=25).

Placebo effects are likely influenced by many variables (e.g., invasiveness of treatment, duration of follow-up, expectations of study population) and understanding their impact on outcome measures is critical to successful development of new treatments. Yet, knowledge of such effects is currently limited for SUI therapies. Likewise, SUI outcome measures must be viewed in terms of their sensitivity to placebo effects, clinical meaningfulness, and regulatory agency acceptance. From data collected in our first RCT, we correlated QOL improvement with diary-reported IEF reduction to identify clinically meaningful endpoints and estimated the placebo response rate for a cell therapy SUI trial with 12-month follow-up. Importantly, IEF reduction is viewed favorably by regulatory agencies as a primary outcome in SUI studies. Our data also suggest that patients with minimal urethral hypermobility (e.g., patients with recurrent or persistent SUI after incontinence surgery) may represent ideal candidates for sphincter augmentation, which aligns with the proposed mechanism of action for AMDC-USR. Future studies will focus on this patient population by excluding patients with notable urethral hypermobility at screening. ",

A test stimulation (tined lead procedure, TLP) is performed to find out whether adequate symptom reduction is achieved. In centers worldwide the duration of this test stimulation vary considerably and it is not clear when the time of onset of the therapy effect can be expected. The experience in our clinic is that during the test stimulation period for responders it takes up to one week to achieve maximal effect, after the system is turned 'on'. However, no information concerning the so called onset and offset of effect of SNM is available in current literature. The objective of this prospective study is to evaluate the average time span within which \"the onset of the effect\" occurs in patients with LUTS. Knowledge about time of onset and off set, could have several practical clinical implications. Clinical experience renders clues that this time spans might be different for OAB and NOR patients.

This attitude may serve to \"normalise\" the condition in older women and make the well-described delays in treatment seeking more likely. Severity of incontinence, younger age and a greater severity of disease experience are known to influence the likelihood of seeking help, but in a large community study, only 15.3% of people >60 years of age with incontinence expressed a \"felt need\" for healthcare [1, 2] . The aim of this study was to describe the distribution of UI, including type, frequency and impact on quality of life and likelihood of having sought help, in a large cohort of Canadian community dwelling older women. The relationship of the belief that UI is normal for aging with frequency of urine leakage, pad use, quality of life and help-seeking behaviour was examined and analysed Study design, materials and methods This was a secondary analysis of data collected as part of a large randomised controlled trial which evaluated whether continence promotion and self-management improved HRQoL in community dwelling older women. This study used baseline data from all women who signed consent for data collection and who were both eligible and ineligible for participation in the primary study. Collected data included validated assessments of overall health, physical activity, frequency of incontinence using the ICIQ-FLUTS scale, incontinence subtype (urgency, stress, mixed, other, help-seeking behaviour, and quality of life using the Incontinence Quality of Life (I-QOL) and Short Form 12 (SF-12) questionnaires. Data were analysed in STATA version 12.1 to describe the characteristics of the sample, the distribution of LUTS / UI, UI severity and quality of life. The relationship between symptom severity and QoL were examined using correlations and compared to women without LUTS / UI using unpaired t-tests. Multivariable logistic regression analyses described the relationships between diagnosis, severity and impact on HRQoL using the belief that UI is normal for ageing as the dependent variable.",

In contrast, women who held this belief were less likely to have either performed previous pelvic floor exercises or sought health care, although not statistically significantly so. There was no association between the belief that UI is normal for aging and UI subtype, it was anticipated that women may be more likely to suffer stress incontinence, as women may associate this with an expected consequence of childbirth. Compared to those women who think incontinence isn't normal for ageing, women who think incontinence is normal for aging experience a significantly worse impact of UI on QoL.

The LPS solution was replaced 30 minutes after the beginning of instillation to avoid dilution with urine. The second group received intravesical instillation of saline and served as controls. Twenty-four hours after LPS or saline instillation 16 animals (8 saline; 8 LPS) were sacrificed, bladder and urethra were collected and processed for immunohistochemistry or 5-HT quantification by HPLC. For immunohistochemistry, antibodies against 5-HT, the pan-neuronal marker \u03b23-Tubulin, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), synaptic vesicle 2 (SV2) and tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) were used. The number of cells expressing 5-HT was quantified and averaged in at least 5 sagital slices per animal. The total amount of 5-HT in the entire bladder and entire urethra was quantified by HPLC and expressed as pmol per mg of tissue. The remaining 8 animals (4 saline; 4 LPS) underwent cistometry under urethane anaesthesia for evaluation of bladder reflex activity. Bladder recordings were acquired during the continuous infusion of saline during 1 hour followed by the continuous infusion of 5-HT (100 uM) for another hour. Urodynamic parameters were analysed, quantified and averaged before and after 5-HT infusion. Statistical analysis was performed in the GraphPad prism software using an unpaired t-test.",

No 5HT immunoreactivity was detected in the urinary bladder. Positive 5HT cells exhibited a round cell body commonly positioned in the basal layers of the epithelium and emitted slender processes reaching either the lumen or the lamina propria of the urethra. Positive 5HT cells also expressed \u03b23-Tubulin (pan-neuronal marker), SV2 (synaptic vesicle marker) and TPH (tryptophan hydroxylase, rate-limiting enzyme for the production of 5HT). Below the urethral epithelium, a dense neuronal network was found, containing cholinergic (VAChT + ) and sensory (CGRP + ) fibers frequently showing appositions with the basal aspect of 5HT positive cells. In the urethra of control animals, the mean number of cells expressing 5HT was 181,3\u00b17,80 cells/slice which significantly decreased to 117,1\u00b110,35 cells/slice (p\u22640.01) in animals with LPS inflammation. Tissue levels of 5HT measured by HPLC were below sensitivity (1.5 pmol/mg of tissue) in the bladder. In the urethra of control rats 5HT levels were 15,36\u00b12,81 pmol/mg tissue. After inflammation, 5HT levels decreased to 7,45\u00b10,42 pmol/mg tissue (p\u22640.05). Regarding cistometry, the normal micturition pattern observed during the continuous infusion of saline in control animals was significantly altered by the continuous infusion of 5HT (100 uM). The urinary frequency was significantly decreased (0.6\u00b10.093 to 0.28\u00b10.037; p<0.05) and the maximal detrusor pressure and the amplitude of voiding contractions increased (44.71\u00b11.458 to 53.49\u00b11.176 and 34.95\u00b10.804 to 46.24\u00b11.011, respectively p\u22640.001). In inflamed animals, a typical high frequency of voiding contractions was observed during saline infusion. This pattern was immediately altered by the infusion of 5-HT (100 uM), with a significant decrease of the frequency of voiding contractions to values similar to controls (1.4\u00b10.10 to 0.53\u00b10.025; p<0.05). Interestingly contractions appeared in bursts. Interpretation of results 5HT cells occurring in the urethral urothelium, in close proximity with sensory and cholinergic suburothelial nerve fibers exhibit neuronal-like characteristics (paraneurons) and may regulate the frequency and amplitude of bladder voiding contractions through the release of 5HT. Therefore we suggest that urethral 5HT cells may act as local sensors of external stimuli, similarly to what has been shown to occur with acetylcholine-containing cells in the same epithelium (3) . 5HT cells decrease during inflammation.",

Human relaxin-2 (hRLX2) is a pleiotropic insulin-like hormone, primarily detected in the blood-stream during pregnancy, to relax the uterus and allow the cervix and symphysis pubis to expand during delivery. It acts on G-protein coupled relaxin receptors 1 & 2, causing transient elevations of cAMP and cGMP and activation of transcription factors that lead to anti-inflammatory, vasodilatory and anti-oxidative properties, and reversal of fibrosis. We have established a mouse model of radiation cystitis that develops severe fibrosis within seven weeks and tested a hypothesis that hRLX2 can reverse fibrosis to re-establish normal bladder function.",

The urethra and pudendal nerve were harvested for anatomical assessment. ANOVA with a Student-Newman-Keuls posthoc test was used to compare quantitative outcomes with P<0.05 indicating a significant difference. Data is presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean. Interpretation of results Control CCM-treated rats performed better than SI rats in urethral function as measured by LPP testing 3 wk after PNC+VD, suggesting that control CCM can restore continence effectively, consistent with our previous study [1] . PNC+VD rats treated with scrambled CCM showed no difference in LPP from SI rats, although BDNF was decreased compared to SI rats. However, control CCM-treated rats had significantly higher LPP than the other injury groups, including PNC+VD rats treated with scrambled CCM, suggesting that lentiviral transfection even with scrambled shRNA may alter other secretions important for promotion of recovery. In contrast, pudendal nerve recovery was facilitated by all 3 formulations of CCM tested, as indicated by improvements in PNSBP firing rate in all CCM treated groups compared to the CM treated group. However, histology findings showed better recovery in rats with BDNF KD CCM, scrambled CCM or normal CCM than ST rats, suggesting low amounts of BDNF may still be able to promote recovery of neuromuscular function but may take longer to recover to continence.",

This means we need to understand the morphology and physiology at different states. Given the limitations of direct study of human beings, some lab mammals are alternatives. Female canine has unique advantages for this purpose: its urethra has clear tissue layers, long proximal urethral segment with pure smooth muscle and a distal segment with strong striated muscle. Importantly, canine urethra structure represents a preliminary status of the urethra evolution because canine locates at the lower level of the mammal branch on evolution tree.

The possible movements of pelvic structures were observed directly and video-recorded and, the electromyography (EMG) of the striated urethral sphincter (SUS) and the levator ani (LA) were recorded. In 6 randomly chosen canines the urethral pressure profile (UPP) was recorded with a 7F urethral pressure catheter. Then we determined the segmental distribution of continence function along the whole urethra by the test of segmental invalidation of urethra (TSIU). This was achieved by inserting a 12F catheter into urethra lumen step by step at an interval of 1/16 of the whole urethral length (each interval is 4 to 5 mm, which was determined on basis of UPP of individual animal) and recording LPP at each step. The other 6 animals not having UPP and TSIU were used for morphological study. The whole urethra together with vagina was fixed and divided averagely into 16 segments and then embedded in paraffin.

Both guanethidine and phenoxybenzamine treatment of WAS animals normalized these alterations, supporting sympathetic nervous system involvement. There was no difference in basal ROS production in between WAS or control UTC. In contrast, ROS generation in response to stressors (H2O2; 100 \u00b5M) was significantly higher in WAS UTC. ROS were also generated in both control and WAS UTC by stimulation of \u03b1-ARs with phenylephrine (10 \u00b5M) but not of \u03b2-ARs with isoproterenol (1 \u00b5M). We also find that chronic stress correlates with increased mucosal protein carbonylation as well as an increase in pAMPK often termed the metabolic gate keeper of the cell. In addition, we find an increase in mitofusin 2, which is thought to suppress cell proliferation and exert apoptotic effects. In all cases, we see a normalization in these targets in WAS animals treated with guanethidine or phenoxybenzamine. Interpretation of results While a number of factors are likely to contribute to chronic pain disorders, accumulating evidence suggests that altered cellular metabolism (i.e. mitochondrial functions) plays a key role. Mitochondrial uptake of calcium is important for cell survival and regulating release of mediators (such as ATP and ROS).The mitochondrial membrane potential \u03a8m is an important parameter to assess the functional state of these organelles. Disturbances in \u03a8m could result in alterations of cell metabolism, increased ROS production and altered calcium homeostasis; all of which were observed in WAS UTC.",

Previous work demonstrates that rat PFMs, including coccygeus (C), iliocaudalis (IC), and pubocaudalis (PC), undergo differential alterations in pregnancy [1, 2] . We sought to determine how pregnancy-induced adaptations modulate individual PFM response to strain produced by vaginal distention (simulating parturition) in a rat model. Study design, materials and methods Three-month-old Sprague-Dawley primigravid late pregnant (P) (N=13) and virgin nonpregnant (NP) rats (N=15) underwent vaginal distention (VD), replicating fetal crowning, with balloon volumes ranging from 1-5 millilitres (mL). Because differences in distensibility of other pelvic tissues in P and NP animals could impact strain effect on the PFMs, intrapelvic pressure (IP) generated during vaginal distention was measured with a pressure gauge contiguous with the balloon. To match a full spectrum of IPs observed in the NP group, an additional 11 P rats underwent VD with 6-10 mL volumes. Agematched P and NP rats (N=10/group) that did not undergo vaginal distention served as respective controls. Animals were anesthetized using isoflurane gas mixed with oxygen delivered via nose cone. P and NP rats were sacrificed and PFMs, which include coccygeus (C), iliocaudalis (IC), and pubocaudalis (PC), were fixed in situ to preserve in vivo architecture, harvested, and divided into 3 regions. Fiber bundles, consisting of 10-20 fibers, were dissected from each region of each muscle and fiber length (Lf) was measured. Bundles were microdissected into fibers for sarcomere length (Ls) determination by laser diffraction. Comparisons were performed by repeated measures and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by multiple comparisons with \u0160id\u00e1k or Dunnett's test, as appropriate.

In particular, PC was extremely attenuated, with an almost translucent appearance of its enthesial region at distention volumes > 2 mL. Similar distortion was noted in C, while alterations in IC were less prominent. We believe these gross changes are due to myofiber stretch, as evidenced by significant increases in PFM fiber length (Lf) after VD compared to controls. As expected, PFM stretch ratios increased progressively with increase in strain volume. The largest stretch ratios were observed in C (1.7-2 in NP and 1.4-1.8 in P), compared to PC (1.4-1.8 in NP and 1.3-1.5 in P) and IC (1.3-1.4 in NP and 1.2-1.3 in P). Paralleling gross anatomic and macroscopic findings, VD resulted in progressive increase in Ls with rising distention volume. The magnitude of strain effect varied by muscle, with the greatest Ls change observed in C, followed by PC, and a smaller rise in IC, observed only at higher distention volumes (Table) . We next compared PFM Ls of NP and P rats at each distention volume between 1-5 mL.

Our data demonstrate that in PFMs, mechanical strain results in acute sarcomere elongation, a wellestablished cause of mechanical injury in other skeletal muscles. Pregnancy-induced adaptations in PFMs appear to attenuate sarcomere hyperelongation in response to strain. The limitations of our study are inherent to use of animal models to represent human conditions. Given the ethical impossibility of directly probing PFMs in women during pregnancy and childbirth, animal models are essential to expand our understanding of the impact of pregnancy and vaginal delivery on the PFMs. The rat has been shown to have similar PFM architecture to humans, exhibits PFM adaptations in pregnancy, and is a useful model for the study of pregnancy and delivery-induced changes in the pelvic floor. In our protocol, since each animal must be euthanized in order to harvest PFMs, we were not able to follow the same animal longitudinally. Instead, we had to rely on cross-sectional examination of animals from each group and assumed homogeneity. Although this was a necessary constraint of our study design, Sprague-Dawley rats are widely used in biomedical research in general and, specifically, in studies of simulated birth injury. Furthermore, rats were obtained from a single vendor, were age-matched, were often from the same litter, and were housed together to minimize environmental variability and to assure concordant estrous cycle stage in NP animals.",

A major underlying mechanism for these symptoms is abnormal sensory processing due to alterations in the pathways that detect, process, and transmit sensory stimuli from the periphery to the central nervous system (CNS). Sensory information from the urethra, including flow of fluid, distension, irritation, infection or pH, is critical for bladder function, triggering and/or amplifying bladder contractions and contributing to efficient emptying (1) (2) (3) . In pathologies, such as infections or incontinence, it is believed that increased excitatory input from the urethra contributes to bladder overactivity and symptoms of urgency, frequency and pain. However, how sensory information from the urethra is detected and transmitted to the CNS is not understood. We put forth the novel hypothesis that specialized cells within the urethral epithelium (called paraneurons) are part of a 'sensory web', which can detect, shape and transmit specific modalities of sensory information. The aim of this study is to characterize the morphology and putative function of a class of paraneurons, distinguished from other cells by their serotonergic (5-HT) content.",

Furthermore, visceral hyperalgesia developed in response to urethral distension after intra-urethral 5-HT perfusion. Additionally, 5-HT increased [Ca 2+ ]i in non-capsaicin sensitive primary afferent neurons, suggesting that 5-HT can alter the excitability of other non-nociceptive afferents.

The PFM include the coccygeus, ileococcygeuos, pubococcygeus, and puborectalis muscles, the latter two frequently referred together as the pubovisceralis muscle (PVM) [1] . The impairment of the pelvic floor muscles (PFM) is a major ingredient to develop urinary incontinence (IU) and/or pelvic organ prolapse (POP) (Schwertner-Tiepelmann et al., 2012). These disorders may result from changes in the biomechanical properties of the supportive structures that occur from weakness or impairment of muscles or ligaments, or alterations in the stiffness of the pelvic fascia associated with the risk factors -age, hormonal changes, among others [2] . The related conditions have been studied through imaging techniques and experimental in vitro studies, evaluating biomechanical properties of the pelvic ligaments, vaginal tissue and levator ani (LA) muscle. To obtain these biomechanical properties, acquired tissue during surgery or from female cadaver has been tested using different techniques. However, these collected tissues are frequently afflicted in clinical environment, and consequently, the comparison to in vivo healthy tissues is difficult. Hence, these studies show the nonlinear mechanical behavior, but they do not reflect the natural conditions for in vivo muscle behavior in the pelvis. In this context, the computational analysis coupled with in vivo biomechanical properties may help to correctly reproduce the biomechanical behavior of the PFM.",

To address this deficiency, a patient-controlled, real-time sensation meter has been employed previously in noninvasive hydration studies to measure patient sensation during filling [1] . In the current study, we aim to evaluate real-time sensation during the filling phase of urodynamics in order to develop novel metrics to define sensation kinetics.

Urodynamics were performed according to ICS guidelines. Prior to testing, all patients completed the ICIQ\u2212OAB questionnaire and were instructed on the use of the meter. Patients with incontinence during filling, non-continuous filling or not reaching 100% sensation were excluded from analysis. Sensation data was obtained at 10Hz and time linked to urodynamic data. Infused volumes were normalized as a percentage of cystometric capacity for statistical analysis. Sensation data obtained from our real-time sensation meter were sampled at every 5% cystometric capacity and sensation-capacity curves were generated for each patient. The sensation curves were then divided into equal quartiles (Q1-Q4) and sensation velocity (vi), defined as \u0394sensation/\u0394capacity, was calculated for each quartile ( Figure 2) . A sensation index (SI) was calculated for each patient and defined as 4 th quartile sensation velocity/1 st quartile sensation velocity (v4/v1). Patients were grouped via ICIQ-OAB urgency scores (question 5a: 0 -4) and analysed for changes in sensation velocity between quartiles.

Patterns in sensation kinetics may be useful in distinguishing filling phase pathology, ultimately allowing for more targeted therapy. Hypothesis / aims of study Analysis of detrusor voiding contraction derives increasing attention. A recent publication introduces a derivate of pre-voiding isovolumic pressure increase as a proxy for detrusor (voiding contraction or) contractility. In a small series of urodynamic (pressure flow) tests was shown that 'velocity of initial pressure rise' (dP/dT before flow) had been an indicator for detrusor contractility independent from gender. There is however a paucity of data regarding (pre-voiding) opening detrusor pressure, flow acceleration (before Qmax) and contraction velocity during the voiding. We present clinical epidemiological data to unravel how these parameters relate to gender and to detrusor maximum work during voiding and to outflow conditions. Study design, materials and methods A database with 2180 pressure flow studies (all>45years; 620 women & 1560 men) performed in (men in) preferred position after cystometry until strong (but not extreme) desire to void, was analysed. All voiding volumes were >100mL. Detrusor pressure at the start of flow (P-Open -cmH2O) flow acceleration to Qmax (Accel -mL/s 2 ) and mean (total-) voiding detrusor shortening (contraction) velocity, based on mean flowrate, (Velocit mL/s) were tested for correlation, and also with Wmax (maximum contraction work during voiding) and URA (bladder outlet resistance). Results are given for men and women. Scatter-dot-graphs are presented to show associations between the parameters. ",

The difference between absolute values of pcuff.int and pves.isv is in part accounted for by the height difference between the reference point for the two measurements (upper border of pubic symphysis for invasively measured bladder pressures and mid-point of the penile urethra for cuff pressures). However significant variability still exists and this study has suggested possible reasons for this. Our analysis has shown that pcuff.int is closer aligned to the intravesical pressure at the end of the 2 second period of flow arrest rather than the intravesical pressure measured immediately after flow arrest. This is largely explained by the fact that the majority (71%) of men exhibited a rise in bladder pressure after isovolumetric conditions were imposed, which is supported by previous observations (2) . However this was not always the case and for nearly 1/3 of inflations a fall in intravesical pressure during isovolumetric conditions. For some, this was because detrusor contraction was already decreasing in magnitude before flow was interrupted. This may reflect a degree of voluntary inhibition or an inability to produce sustained contractions. The finding of a reduction in the error between pcuff.int and pves.isv during inflations occuriing later in the void suggests that voluntary inhibition during initial inflations may be occurring in some patients. We also observed correlation between the error with magnitude of pcuff.int which may suggest that the error is proportional rather than fixed.",

Conceptually, WF represents the mechanical power generated per unit area of the bladder wall surface. Intuitively, increasing WF values might indicate that the bladder muscles have sufficient physiological reserves. Therefore, Wmax is a measure of detrusor contraction strength at a single point in time, but it is necessary to produce a WF curve throughout micturition to assess overall detrusor contractility. Neither Wmax nor WF provides any information about detrusor contraction sustainability, whereas combination of Wmax% and WF-AUC can be used to detect changes in detrusor contraction patterns. In the current patients setting, both Wmax% and WF-AUC are significantly increased after RP. This could represent the bladder muscles have recovered after RP as sufficient physiological reserves.

These techniques can lead to significant discomfort and possible complications to patients; moreover, they represent for the health agencies an economic burden in terms of costs associated with supplies, and above all they require a great deal of personnel's time; finally, current techniques are inadequate for urodynamic analysis in pediatric subjects. This project expands the work previously carried-out by the same research team on the analysis of the hydraulic behavior of bladder-urethra system. The research is based on a physical model specifically designed and assembled in our laboratory and experiments on water jets issuing from elastic tubes with similar behavior to the urethra and the development of mathematical models suitable to represent the complex phenomena that occur in the LUT in physiological and pathological conditions. Based on the previous results, a new instrumentation for non-invasive urodynamic diagnostic was developed. This instrumentation does not have any parts in contact with the human body, moreover it is characterized by the same diagnostic reliability of the current techniques in use. The basic concept arises from considering the LUT similar to a hydraulic system consisting of a pressure feed tank (bladder) and an outlet elastic duct (urethra) whose physical behavior is governed by the laws of fluid mechanics. Starting from the knowledge of the physical quantities of the urinary jet measurable outside of the urethra it is possible to model the LUT internal urodynamic characteristics.",

A digital camera is placed on the right side; both instruments have been positioned on supports connected to the bearing structure.

Tests on male patients aged 18 or over and with voided volumes of 150 ml or over only were included. Since BOO is diagnosed using the BOO Index (BOOI), the change in BOOI was calculated for varying levels of disparity in the pressure measurement. The range of 1 to 15 cmH2O disparity was chosen, this being the maximum range of difference found in recent studies between systems using water and air. The BOOI will change by the same amount as the change in pressure at maximum flow, since the Index is directly calculated from that pressure less twice the maximum flow rate. The analysis made is a worst case scenario, because not all of the differences in measurement between air and water systems will be at the limits quoted above. Those figures are the 95% limits of agreement, so many differences seen will be less than 10 cmH2O.

Information about mode of delivery and parity was obtained from the National Birth Registry. The women underwent a pelvic floor ultrasound scan with a GE Voluson S6 device, using the RAB 4-8 RS abdominal threedimensional probe with an acquisition angle of 85 o . Four dimensional ultrasound volumes were acquired at rest, contraction and Valsalva maneuvre. Off-line analysis of the ultrasound volumes was performed using the 4D View Version 14 Ext.0 software 6-32 months later, blinded to all clinical and obstetrical data. Tomographic ultrasound imaging was used for evaluation of the LAM. A significant LAM injury was defined as a unilateral or bilateral abnormal insertion of the most medial fibers of the LAM to the pubic bone present in the plane of minimal levator hiatal dimensions and the planes 2.5 and 5 mm cranial to this. Levator hiatal area at Valsalva was measured in the plane of minimal hiatal dimensions in a rendered volume of 1-2 cm thickness. For the anal sphincters a set of eight slices was obtained on tomographic ultrasound imaging, where the entire external anal sphincter (EAS) was encompassed by placing the upper slice cranial to the EAS (at the level of the puborectalis muscle) and the lower caudal to the internal anal sphincter (IAS), at the level of the anal verge. The distance between each slice was adjusted depending on the length of the EAS, leaving six slices to delineate the entire muscle. The IAS was assessed with the first slice cranial to the IAS (at the level of the anorectal junction) and the most distal slice at the level of the subcutaneous portion of the EAS. Diagnosis of significant injury to the EAS or IAS was defined as \u226530\u00b0 defect of the circumference in \u22654/6 planes on tomographic ultrasound imaging. Then the proportion of women with LAM injury and significant EAS and IAS defect on ultrasound according to vaginal parity was calculated. Mean (SD) hiatal area at Valsalva was calculated. One vaginal delivery was used as reference, and Chi-squared test and Fisher's Exact test was used to compute odds ratios (OR) for comparison of the proportion of women with trauma after 0, 2, 3 and \u22654 vaginal deliveries compared to the reference group. Independent samples t-test was used to compare mean difference (MD) in levator hiatal area at Valsalva between the groups. p<0.05 was counted as statistically significant.",

The only significant difference in prevalence of pelvic floor muscle trauma was found between women with vaginal parity 0 (caesarean section) and 1 vaginal delivery, with no significant effect of subsequent vaginal deliveries. This implicates that most muscle trauma of the pelvic floor occur during the first vaginal delivery. The effect of vaginal parity on symptomatic pelvic floor disorders was not part of this analysis and we cannot exclude an effect of increasing parity on prolapse and incontinence symptoms. Strengths of this study are the large number of women included and the long follow up after first delivery. The National Birth Registry provides high quality of data regarding mode of delivery and parity. Furthermore, standardised criteria for the definition of significant LAM injury, EAS and IAS defects and levator hiatal area were used. We analysed four different variables of pelvic floor anatomy in relation to vaginal parity, which to our knowledge has not been performed previously. A substantial part of the women in this study had forceps at first delivery. Forceps is an independent risk factor for pelvic floor muscle trauma. It is possible that the effect of subsequent deliveries could have been stronger in a population with lower proportion of operative vaginal deliveries at first childbirth.",

The herniation tendency following implantation of hollow fiber PCL-meshes was also demonstrated by Glindtvad et al. (3) . The mechanical tests demonstrated lower ultimate tensile strength and stiffness for the hollow fiber meshes compared to solid fiber meshes. This suggests, that hollow fiber PCL-meshes do not meet the criteria for the optimal tissue-engineering strategy in the treatment of POP, because the degradation rate is too fast. Differently, SoCTGF+rMSC showed higher stiffness compared to the corresponding mesh without rMSC and muscle-fascia. Western blot and q-PCR analysis detected higher amounts of collagen-I and -III in HoLbFGF compared to HoHbFGF after 24 weeks thus demonstrating that collagen synthesis is not dependent on a high dosage of bFGF. Interestingly, none of the rats in SoCTGF+rMSC developed complications at eight or 24 weeks whereas the corresponding PCL-mesh, SoCTGF, was associated with severe abscess formation. This indicates a beneficial effect on the inflammatory response due to rMSCs thus reducing the risk of abscess formation through non-explored mechanisms of action. In the present study, a higher protein amount of collagen III was detected for SoCTGF+rMSC compared to SoCTGF after 8 weeks. At 24 weeks, the difference was reversed. This could imply an initial differential stimulus of the rMSCs and hence an increased collagen formation as described by Jang\u00f6 et al. (2) .",

Herein the results of the analyses of meaningful risk factors affecting products appropriateness are reported in order to provide continence professionals with a better insight empowering them to prevent inappropriate pad provision.",

Overall, 15,385 patients suffering from UI and provided with absorbent products from 01/2012 to 03/2016 were included. All patients/carers have been invited to perform a 48-hour homebased pad test and to fill in a diary with detailed information on their pad usage, as standard of care. Patients had to perform usual daily activity and use their usual pads. The diaries were analysed by continence professionals. The pad usage was defined as appropriate if the maximum absorbent capacity of the product was from 30% to 50% higher than the mean real urine load. A limit of \u00b150 ml has been considered in order to define borderline products. To investigate risk factors influencing prescription appropriateness, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed using Logit model. Several demographic, antropometric and clinical patients' characteristics have been included in the model. Statistically significant factors at univariate analysis have been included in the multivariate model. Statistical significance has been set at P < 0.05.",

Patients with restricted mobility and needing assistance may be provided with too large products in order to reduce the changing frequency and ease the caregivers' work. The association of inappropriateness with lower urine load is justified by the frequent utilisation of a limited proportion of the product's absorbent capacity particularly among patients with light-moderate UI. Patients with very long wearing time had very light UI but were provided with excessively large products. The differences between health districts can be multifactorial: clients' cultural differences, regional health services disparities in resources and methods of products provision, different products costs.",

            "text": "Hypothesis / aims of study Urinary incontinence (UI) and faecal incontinence (FI) are common and distressing conditions that increase in prevalence with age and can lead to severe psychosocial morbidity in some individuals. Incontinence is associated with an increased risk of developing pressure ulcers (4.1% in continent patients vs. 16.3% in incontinent patients) [1] . Timely changing of incontinence products is important since patients are at risk of developing incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD). In frail and acutely unwell hospitalized patients, containment with incontinence products such as pads is often an immediate management strategy [2] . Nurses and other healthcare providers must understand the impact of incontinence on elderly inpatients in order to maintain dignity and provide person-centred care, but there are very little quantitative data on what patients and providers view as an acceptable time to remain in a soiled pad. Without knowing how closely aligned patient and provider perspectives are in terms of \"waiting times\" with urinary and faecal soiling, it is difficult to deliver best possible continence care and minimize distress to patients. The primary objective of this study was to examine patient and direct care provider (DCP) views on the acceptable and actual lengths of time spent in a soiled pad during the day and the night. A secondary objective was to investigate patient-or DCP-related factors that might contribute to variation in acceptance of longer times spent with either urinary or faecal soiling.",

Standardized, quantitative data collection forms asked patients and DCP for their views on acceptable wait times and estimated actual wait times (minutes) in the following circumstances: 1) soiled with urine during the day, 2) soiled with urine at night 3) soiled with faeces during the day, and 4) soiled with faeces at night. Data on previous continence status, pad use, use of mobility aids and place of residence (community, institution) were collected. Inclusion criteria were patients aged 65 years and older. Patients who were unable to provide consent due to underlying cognitive impairment and/or acute medical illness were excluded. DCP (registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and nursing assistants) had a minimum of three months' inpatient care experience. Those who spent less than 25% of their working time providing direct patient care were excluded. A sample size of 50 patients and 50 DCP was planned to give a robust estimate of acceptability. Wait times were categorized into 0-30 (score 1), 31-60 (score 2), 61-90 (score 3), 91-120 (score 4), 121-150 (score 5), 151-180 (score 6), and >181 (score 7) for urine and 0-15 (score 1), 16-30 (score 2), 31-45 (score 3), and 46-60 (score 4) for faeces to examine the distributions. This allowed calculation of a composite \"tolerance score\" of patient and provider attitudes toward wait times by summing the categorical scores (range 4-22) to categorize each patient or provider as \"low\" tolerance (generally intolerant of incontinence; score \u22648) or \"high\" tolerance (generally tolerant of incontinence; score >8). Tolerance score cutoffs were defined by median score. Differences between groups were assessed using Student's t-test, correlations with Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Patient-or DCP-related factors associated with tolerance to incontinence were analysed by univariate and multivariate binomial logistic regression. A p-value <0.05 was deemed statistically significant.",

Over half of patients (60%) were regular users of continence pads (either using them at night or on a 24-hour basis). Eighty per cent of patients lived at home, and 58% of patients used some form of walking aid (such as a cane or walker). The majority of patients (90%) felt that a wait time of up to 60 minutes in the case of daytime urinary incontinence was acceptable (66% less than 30 minutes). This was significantly shorter than DCPs (38.0 vs. 85.9 min for patients and DCPs, respectively; p<0.0001), nearly half of whom (44%) deemed daytime urinary incontinence wait times of an hour or more to be acceptable, 14% even considering wait times of two and half to three hours to be acceptable. At night, for urinary incontinence, 56% deemed wait times of over 60 minutes acceptable, although the distribution was more variable; 28% reported wait times of two and a half hours or more to be acceptable. Interpretation of results There was considerable patient-provider mismatch for daytime UI, with patients mostly intolerant of urinary soiling of over an hour but DCPs reporting that they felt that longer wait times were acceptable. Both patients and DCPs reported that pads soiled by FI required changing within 15 mins during both day and night. The vast majority of both patients and providers reported that long wait times (over fifteen minutes) with FI were unacceptable, most likely reflecting cultural and societal differences in attitudes towards urine and faeces (the latter being regarded as \"worse\" than the former) [3] . These assumptions need revisiting both from the patient perspective (i.e., that they do not have to accept soiling due to UI) and the provider perspective (i.e., that patients only find FI distressing). Although patient-and DCP-reported \"actual\" wait times were consistently longer than those deemed acceptable, there were significant differences in the value reported between patients and DCPs. The reporting of actual times by the majority of DCPs at two or three hours may reflect predefined care round schedules and a lack of detailed knowledge (or direct questioning) about exactly how long patients had been soiled.",

A similar majority found the Navina system easy to handle, which is an indication that an electronic device may be an advantage from a patient's perspective. The heterogeneity and small patient number mean limited conclusions can be drawn about response to Navina in different patient subtypes.",

The Weisner was acceptable to most and most effective at preventing leakage. It was also the only clamp associated with haematuria (x1 episode) and elicited the highest pain score. Physiological Impact: Varying interface pressures were noted between clamps for each individual participant to the order of 156.5mmHg and across all participants (mean 137.4mmHg, SD 69.7; range 20-310mmHg). Pressures >300mmHg were recorded with the Cunningham clamp and associated with a substantial decrease in superficial penile blood perfusion distal to the clamp. On clamp removal perfusion levels were restored. Other than the Uriclak, pressures generally decreased with wear time. In practice, this required adjustment of the clamp by the participants to maintain continence. MRI scanning of the penis identified substantial deformation compared to the unloaded morphology ( Fig. 2a/b ) under clamping pressure from the Dribblestop (Fig. 3a) and Weisner (Fig. 3b) . The corpus cavernosum and corpus spongiosum were flattened in cross-sectional images. Tissues external to Buck's fascia, incorporating blood vessels and skin, were displaced laterally to areas outside of the clamp pads. Urine was contained within the urethra proximal to the clamp site.",

It has been reported that in Japan, 50% of people aged over 60 have urinary incontinence. It is said that urinary incontinence significantly decreases QOL (Quality of life) as it leads to urinary tract infections, physical dysfunction in seniors, bed-ridden elderly and causes dementia in the elderly. Additionally, a study compared the frequency of the use of diapers in facilities for the elderly with incontinence in Japan and European countries and reported that use in Japan is extremely high. This is because elderly residents of facilities who are able to go to the bathroom during the day are given diapers for urinating at night due to manpower shortages and strategies to prevent falling. In Japan in 1984, polymer absorbent adult diapers began to be used. The improved water absorption capacity of diapers gave birth to all-night use of diapers for elderly with urinary incontinence. On the other hand, the quality of night sleep (Quality of Sleep: less QOS) in elderly decreases as they age. Elderly women in particular, often have residual urine due to the effects of chronic cystitis or anti diuretic hormones with 72% of 80 year old women experiencing frequent urination at night which can contribute to sleep disorders. Additionally, as changing diapers or assisting elderly to urinate during the night causes them to wake-up they are often left in wet diapers until scheduled assisted urination times.",

In other studies a connection was found between residual urine volume, urinary incontinence and the amount of daytime activities and it became obvious that these affect sleep and daytime activeness. However, few studies have revealed effects on sleep and activity of individual nursing care for the elderly with dementia who are using diapers. Are seniors who are left to use diapers with incontinence at night really able to sleep soundly? We believe it is of great significance to uncover whether nurses changing diapers and taking patients to the bathroom in line with individual patients' urination patterns inhibits sleep at night or daytime activities. This study is to examine the urinary condition of elderly women with dementia who require nursing care and are institutionalized. After that, proper care was provided for women with urinary incontinence that require nursing care and the impact on sleep and daytime activities of the use of diapers was examined.",

The primary outcomes were cure of UI, frequency and amount of involuntary loss of urine, PFM strength, and quality of life. The homogeneous endpoints with the same unit of measure in at least two studies were plotted in a meta-analysis using Review Manager 5.3 software.

PE was diagnosed by applying the ISSM definition of PE. All of the subjects had lifelong PE with a baseline IELT \u226460 seconds (mean: 31.7 s, range: 16.6-57.4 s). For inclusion in the study, each patient had to be in a stable relationship with a partner for at least 6 months and to engage in sexual intercourse once a week or more often. At the first visit, the patients and their partners were interviewed individually and each was requested to give an independent estimation of IELT. The patients were all treated with PFM rehabilitation. To evaluate the effectiveness of PFM rehabilitation, we compared the mean IELT values of the patients after 12 weeks of treatment. The rehabilitation treatment group comprised 40 patients aged 19-46 years (mean age: 30 years) with a mean baseline IELT of 31.7 \u00b1 14.8 s (range: 16.6-57.4 s). The PFM rehabilitation protocol consisted of (1) physiokinesitherapy to achieve a muscle contraction that allows the patient to be aware of motor activity; (2) electro-stimulation of the perineal floor to directly stimulate the pudendal nerve, resulting in stimulation of the pubo-rectalis muscle, which causes the urethral sphincter to contract; and (3) biofeedback, in which the patient learns to control the muscle contractions of the perineal floor and the genitourinary sphincter. The patients had three 60-min therapy sessions each week, during which the 3 techniques were applied for 20 min each. The results were measured after the first 20 sessions (6 weeks) and then again at the end of therapy (12 weeks). Physiokinesitherapy and biofeedback were used to train patients to recognise the muscular structures involved in pelvic floor contraction. The patients executed personalised physical exercises, during which they conducted isometric and isotonic contractions of the PFMs. During each session, after execution of the physical exercises, the patients underwent electrostimulation to help strengthen the PFMs. A cylindrical anal probe was positioned in the anal canal. Contact between electrodes in the anal probe and the anterior portion of the sphincter system stimulated the pubovisceral muscles (puborectal and pubourethral); mild, painless electrical pulses were then sent to these muscles via the electrodes.",

Five patients were non-responsive to the treatment, whereas 2 improved their ejaculation after the first 20 sessions and opted to drop out of the study.

A previous study evaluating the somatic and autonomic innervation of the pelvic floor and external urethral sphincter using neurophysiological tests demonstrated that autonomic afferent denervation of the membranous urethral mucosa was seen in most patients after nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy, and this denervation was proposed to attribute to post-prostatectomy incontinence (2) . A recent study in postpartum women received an intensive 3-month PFMT program augmented with biofeedback using ultrasound (US)-images (US-guided PFMT) from 3 to 6 months postpartum showed that motor learning of correct pelvic floor muscle (PFM) contractions was associated with early recovery of urinary continence (3). We hypothesized that if similar US-guided PFMT introduced before RARP facilitates motor learning of correct PFM contraction and ameliorates urethral sphincter dysfunction related to the membranous urethral afferent denervation after RARP, US-guided PFMT would be applicable also for achieving early recovery of urinary continence after RARP. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether this US-guided PFMT promotes early recovery of urinary continence after RARP.",

The correct contraction of PFM was judged by shortening the membranous urethral diameter and closing of the bladder neck on the US images. Thereby, patients could recognize the strength and sensation of PFM contractions before RARP and relearn them after RARP. In the verbal-PFMT group, patients received verbal instruction of PFMT by a nurse using a standardized leaflet after the removal of a transurethral catheter in the ward. Urinary continence status was defined as pad-use less than one per day by self-report postoperatively. Statistical analyses were carried out by Student's t test, Fisher's exact test, or the Cox proportional-hazards model.",

Although incontinence improves or resolves over the first several months following prostatectomy, even transient incontinence can deter the return to employment and resumption of beneficial activity, since activity worsens stress incontinence. Also, studies show that a significant number of men have long-term post-prostatectomy incontinence sufficient to warrant wearing a pad [1] . At least six adequately powered, randomized controlled trials have shown that perioperative outpatient pelvic floor muscle training can hasten postoperative recovery of bladder control and reduce the severity of incontinence following radical prostatectomy [2, 3] . However, most men undergoing prostatectomy do not receive this training. One reason is a lack of providers trained in male pelvic floor muscle rehabilitation. Also, men may have difficulty getting time off from work or not want to travel long distances to attend this training if it is available. To provide more men with perioperative pelvic floor rehabilitation, we developed a home telehealth program, based on an evidence-based in-clinic protocol that reduced post-prostatectomy incontinence. The program was then pilot tested to demonstrate feasibility and patient acceptance.",

Literature on comparative effectiveness indicates that behavioural treatments are either equivalent to or more effective than medications for reducing incontinence and overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms, without exposing patients to the typical side effects of medications. However, pelvic floor physiotherapy has a lack of evidence regarding long-term outcomes and comparison with other treatments. The aims of this study were to determine the long-term effect of Biofeedback Assisted Pelvic Floor Muscle Therapy (BAPFMT) in female patients with OAB on symptoms, health-related Quality of Life (QoL) and the effect on the EMG signals of the individual pelvic floor muscles after one year follow-up.",

Comparison between groups for continuous variables was made by repeated measure analysis of variance using a mixed model after transformation of the data to enhance normality, with treatment, time (categorical) and their interaction as fixed effects and with random patient effects Results Fifty-eight patients were included in this study. Before treatment and after one year follow up the groups were comparable on all key parameters such as severity measures and loss of urine. There were no significant changes between the two groups after one year follow up. Thirteen patients were lost to follow-up at one year. Of 45 women the results at the start of the study were compared to the results after one year follow up. During the one year follow up patients received no other intervention. After one year, the PeLFIs showed significant improvement in complaints of OAB in the domains micturition pattern, urinary incontinence, obstructive micturition and pain (p< 0.05). For the KHQ the domains, social limitations, and severity measures improved significantly. The 24-hr voiding diary and 24-hr pad test showed significant reduction at one year follow up compared to the start of the study. Figure 1 shows the average loss in grams for the two groups. An average reduction of more than 50% is achieved after BAPFMT with the MAPLe after treatment. Furthermore it shows that the effect of the treatment is sustained after one year follow-up in both groups. Besides QoL measures, average EMG signals per electrode for rest, MVC, and endurance were calculated and compared for every patient. At one year follow-up, for the combined groups tone at rest was significantly lower for electrodes at the urogenital diaphragm, nearest to the bladder and urethra on the anterior side and nearest to the iliococcygeus muscle on the left side and in the deepest region on the posterior side and significantly higher on the left side nearest to the bulbospongiosus and ischiocavernosus.

For the right side of the pubo coccygeus muscle the average EMG was significantly higher and for the iliococcygeus significantly lower. For endurance, average EMG for the puborectal muscle overall was significantly higher and significantly lower for one deeper region of the urogenital diaphragm ( Figure 2 ).

Our overview analysis and selection criteria were specified in advance and documented in a protocol (2) . We comprehensively searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (from inception to September 2016) for systematic reviews of trials involving women with UI which investigated the effectiveness of conservative management. Our primary outcomes of interest were cure or improvement (CorI) as reported by the women and condition-specific QoL questionnaires. Secondary outcomes included adverse effects, general quality of life, and pelvic floor muscle strength. Two independent reviewers applied selection criteria and assessed the methodological quality of the reviews using the Risk of Bias in Systematic reviews (ROBIS) tool. We documented the quality of evidence synthesised within the reviews using a modified GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. Data relating to the effects of conservative management on female stress, urgency or mixed urinary incontinence (SUI, UUI, MUI), and comparisons of conservative management versus control, versus other conservative management, or versus non-conservative management, were extracted and summarised within tables. The data extracted included the number of trials, number of participants, participant characteristics, intervention, comparison, outcomes (primary and secondary), timing of outcomes, our GRADE decisions, evidence of effect and notes on direction of effect.

It has been reported that PFMT can be performed with special vaginal/rectal devices in the form of resistance training (2, 3). B\u00f8 suggested a different way of resistance training with a vaginal cone, by which the cone is placed into the vagina and the patient was asked to contract around the cone while a physiotherapist or the patient simultaneously try to pull it out (3). This new training results in the elimination of the weight of the cone during the process of pulling it out of the vagina. So, we preferred to use inexpensive, hygienic, and single-use vaginal tampons in this training method. To the best of our knowledge, there is no randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating the additional effect of resistance training with vaginal tampons in SUI. Therefore, the aim of this RCT was to assess vaginal tampon training (VTT) combined with PFMT results in better outcomes than PFMT alone for the treatment of SUI.",

Inclusion criteria were being 35-60 years of age, having symptoms of SUI according to MESA urinary incontinence questionnaire, being able to contract the pelvic floor muscles, and had sufficient literacy. Women excluded from the present study who: had undergone surgery for incontinence; were taking medications for UI; had neurological disorders; had recent/recurrent urinary tract infections; had Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) score \u2265 Stage 3 according to POP Quantification System; were pregnant or in a postnatal period of under 6 months. After a comprehensive clinical evaluation and a screening for the inclusion criteria, a computer-based block randomization procedure was used to assign blocks of four participants to each study arm (PFMT+VTT or PFMT). A standardized 12 weeks of training protocol was performed for both study groups. In PFMT protocol, fast and sustained contractions were taught to all participants. In VTT, the tampon was inserted into the vagina by a physiotherapist (in clinic) or by database searching and snowball-system (n=157) the patient (at home) and while the patient was instructed to contract her pelvic floor muscles around the tampon, the physiotherapist or patient tried to pull it out of the vagina (a total of five days per week; two days by physiotherapist, three days by themselves). In PFMT alone group, biweekly visits were performed to check the progression of training and to increase the adherence of the treatment. The primary outcome measure was a self-reported improvement by 4-item Likert-type scale (worse, same, better, cured). Secondary outcome measures included the severity of urinary incontinence by Incontinence Severity Index (ISI), symptom distress and quality of life score by King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ), number of UI episodes and micturition frequency by urinary diaries, pelvic floor muscle strength (PFMS) and pelvic floor muscle endurance (PFME) by vaginal perineometer. Treatment adherence was also evaluated with 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS). All outcome measures except the self-reported improvement were assessed at baseline, 4 th week, 8 th week and 12 th week. Values were analyzed with Friedmann test (nonnormally distributed data) and Chi-Square tests (for categorical variables). Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon tests were used to compare values (non-normally data) between and within groups, respectively. Alpha was set at 0.05.",

According to pairwise analysis, the PFMT+VTT group experienced a statistically significant improvement in PFMS and PMFE starting from the 8 th week until the end of the treatment. On the other hand, there was a significant improvement in PFMS and PFME only at 12 th week in the PFMT group. In addition, the increase in PFMS and PFME between baseline and 12 th week in the PFMT+VTT group was significantly greater than the PFMT group (p=0.37, p=0.32). Interpretation of results This is the first RCT investigating the additional effect of the different type of resistance training with vaginal tampons to PFMT in the treatment of SUI. The findings from the present study showed that pelvic floor exercises with and without vaginal tampon exercises had similar effectiveness on the symptoms and severity of SUI, quality of life, and subjective cure+improvement rates. Although between group analysis showed no statistically difference in PFMS and PFME at all time points, it appears that the combination therapy may also lead to an earlier and greater increase in PFMS and PFME. While the significant improvements in PFMS and PFME were shown in PFMT+VTT group at the end of the 8 th week, in PFMT group the improvement was only seen at the end of the 12 th week. Concluding message Although there was an earlier and greater improvement in PFMS and PFME in the PFMT+VTT group, combination therapy did not promote greater gains in the subjective cure/improvement rates, severity of urinary incontinence, incontinent episodes, quality of life compared with PFMT alone. We think that resistance training with vaginal tampons may be added to an early phase of training due to the additional effect on PFMS and PFME. Further long-term follow-up RCTs with VTT as an only home-based programme or comparing PFMT with VTT alone are needed. ",

            "text": "Principal component analysis: The examination of spatial distribution of connections within the original ROIs suggests that these were appropriately selected, if slightly off centre, prioritizing the dACC, anterior insula, and anterior mPFC. In future analysis, we will adjust our ROI centre to encompass these connectivity clusters. gPPI analysis: No ROI comparisons survived correction for multiple comparisons. However, we do comment on trends: In the low volume task, insula-mPFC connectivity changes differently in responders to therapy (away from 'normal') compared to nonresponders (towards 'normal'). Such differences may suggest a compensatory reaction in responders. At high volume, changes are slightly larger and tend more towards 'normal' in responders rather than non-responders ( fig 2) . Exploratory voxel-wise analysis: the occipital areas play a significant part, particularly the lingual area (visualization and analysis of the logical order of events). These areas form connections with the insula and dACC and may be part of the coping mechanism for urgency, since responders tend to 'normalize' these connections post-therapy. Non-responders stay in the 'normal' range which may suggest why these strategies are not useful -their connections are not 'abnormal' initially. The connection between the dACC and visual cortex is present even at low volumes, though it diminishes after therapy, possibly indicating a change in perception of the test (pre-urgency), if indeed this represents a visualization mechanism. The mPFC exhibits differential connections with the precuneus, cingulum and post-central gyrus, as expected from our working model. Our previous work showed these areas, but this analysis shows direct connectivity between the areas, dependent on continence status, suggesting that this connection might be involved in the therapeutic mechanism. The insula exhibits differential connections to the motor/sensory cortex, which may support our original hypothesis concerning the SMA-Insula connectivity, but might suggest a revision of (or addition to) our ROI coordinates. The caudate (motor processing, process learning, inhibitory control of actions), putamen (movement regulation) and thalamus (motor/sensory relay, sleep regulation, consciousness), have differential connections to the dACC at rest, suggesting motor processing mechanisms which may be differently dependent on continence status and altered through. Concluding message This builds upon work identifying brain areas involved in UUI by showing how regions interact, how interaction differ between disease states and how interaction changes with therapy. Overarching themes can be observed. Principal component analysis has shown that our selected ROIs are appropriate but suggest a slight positional shift. Figure 1 serves to show that identified connections in responders, tend towards the 'normal' level after therapy (though they may overshoot). In contrast, non-responders have connections which more often move away from normal, or do not change. This theme provides some supportive evidence that our decision to stratify by response may show two subsets of UUI: (1) predominantly caused by a breakdown in brain control of the continence mechanism and which is represented in those who respond to a behavioural therapy which targets cerebral control, and hence 'normalizes' connectivity; and (2) may have another, yet unknown, cause, represented by those who do not respond well to therapy and do not show consistent 'normalization' of connectivity. This suggestion, (initially demonstrated by baseline differences in brain activation of responders and non-responders [2] ) has also been supported by our structural studies (in press). If confirmed by future study, identification of UUI subsets could help therapy trials and targeting of specific UUI types, as well as advance understanding of the brain bladder mechanism. ",

Control subjects were recruited from the gynecology outpatient clinic that had an Overactive Bladder Awareness Tool (OAB-V8) score of <8 and had no urgency or urinary tract infection. In this case control study, we assessed atherosclerosis indicators such as Framingham Risk scores, carotid and femoral artery intima media thicknesses (CIMT and FIMT) and evaluated possible bladder wall responses to atherosclerosis using endovaginal color Doppler ultrasound and urinary cytokines such as Nerve growth factor (NGF), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in women with OAB and controls. CIMT and FIMT measurements were performed using a 9L4 linear high frequency probe in both sides of the neck and the inguinal regions (Acuson S 1000 diagnostic ultrasound device, Siemens Medical Solutions, USA). Endovaginal ultrasound was performed on all participants with the use of a biplane, high frequency (12 MHz) transducer (type 8848, B-K Medical, Herlev, Denmark). To provide quantitative assessment of blood perfusion of bladder neck, commercially available PixelFlux software (Chameleon Software, Germany: www.chameleon-software.de) was used. Each parameter was calculated including data from all imaged vessels in Color Doppler mode coded as red and blue reflecting the direction and velocity of the blood particles movement. Results represent the sum of ''red'' and ''blue'' values named as the ''mix'' value for each parameter (Vmix, Imix, Amix, PImix, and RImix.). These parameters were explained previously (3). Figure 1 shows carotid and femoral arteries intima media thickness measurements and evaluation of bladder neck vascular perfusion with endovaginal ultrasound. In analysis, independent samples t-test was used to evaluate the relationship between OAB and atherosclerotic findings when parametric conditions were met and Mann Whitney U test when parametric conditions were not met. Since OAB-V8 is a Likert style index, Kendall's Tau was used to assess the correlation between the severity of OAB and atherosclerotic variables. P < 0.05 was considered significant.",

Characteristics associated with OAB included pre-existing hypertension (HT) (p < 0.001), higher means of fasting blood glucose (FBG) (p = 0.03), higher total cholesterol (TC) (p = 0.04); higher systolic (p = 0.01) and diastolic blood pressure (BP) (p = 0.004), and higher BMI (p < 0.001). On further analysis, when compared to control group, wet type OAB patients had higher means of FBG (p = 0.03), diastolic BP (p = 0.009), and BMI (p < 0.001), while dry type OAB patients had higher means of FBG (p = 0.03), LDL-C (p = 0.01), TC (p = 0.01) and both systolic (p = 0.004), and diastolic BP (p = 0.04). Indicators of atherosclerosis such as Framingham scores, CIMT and FIMT, the level of urinary biomarkers such as NGF and MCP-1, and the calculated color pixel ratio in region of interest of bladder neck were evaluated. OAB cases had significantly higher means of 10-year CVD and CHD risks (both p < 0.05), and higher right and left carotids intima media thickness (p < 0.05), and femoral artery thickness (p < 0.05). Compared to controls wet type OAB patients had higher means of 10-year CVD, and CHD risks (both p < 0.05), and higher right and left carotid intima thickness (p < 0.05) and femoral artery thickness (p < 0.05). However, 10-year CVD risk was the only variable associated with dry type OAB when compared controls (p < 0.001).

Cytokine concentrations were not significantly different between the groups after urinary creatinine adjustments. In contrast, mean NGF concentrations in dry type OAB patients were higher than the control group (p = 0.001) but similar after adjusting with urine creatinine. Women with OAB have decreased bladder neck perfusion as found by color Doppler ultrasound. In women with OAB, calculated color pixel ratio in the ROI measured by the software system was found to be significantly lower in sagittal section of bladder neck.

A decrease in the CRF concentration in either brain regions or plasma was observed after administration of drugs which exerted antidepressant-like activity, namely SN003 and imipramine, but not after treatment with drugs that did not exhibit this action, namely mirabegron and solifenacin. These observation supports inhibitory effect of antidepressants on hyperactivity of the CRF system. In parallel to antidepressant-like action, SN003 and imipramine (partially) attenuated DO symptoms in 13-cis-RA-administered rats. The current study demonstrates that co-occurrence of depressive and DO symptoms is associated with higher concentration of CRF in brain regions (hypothalamus, amygdala) and plasma. Although the data on the role of CRF receptors in the urinary bladder are scarce, it is plausible that conditions which are present with DO symptoms are associated with alterations in CRF receptors expression in the urinary bladder, which may have a consequence for voiding function. It is also possible that CRF receptor antagonists exert positive effects on cystometric parameters via modifying CRF receptors expression and/or function in the urinary bladder. Moreover, the transcript levels of CRF1 were significantly increased in the hypothalamus of rats after chronic all-trans retinoic acid administration, which produces depressive-like behavior in the FST. Therefore, both OAB and depression may cause peripheral and central alterations of CRF and its receptors while treatment with CRF antagonists may be beneficial in depression co-existing with OAB via normalization of these changes.",

Importantly, while imipramine attenuated only changes in the following cystometric parameters: DOI, ANVC, FNVC and VTNVC, SN003 attenuated changes in almost all cystometric parameters that were induced by 13-cis-RA. These findings suggest that imipramine could be useful in case of OAB dry, while SN003 in case of both, OAB dry and wet. Our data point to CRF1 inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy for co-existing depression and OAB. The possible mechanism may be related to the effects on central/peripheral level of CRF and/or its receptors. ",

Half the sample underwent routine microbiology to identify uropathogens, the rest was used for evaluating bacterial colonisation in exfoliated urothelial cells. Exfoliated urothelial cells were concentrated onto a microscope slide and then stained using Wright staining and approximately 100 cells from each sample were counted by light microscopy and categorized according to the presence of bacteria, the location (attached to the outside of the urothelial cell or appears intracellular) and the bacterial density (low density (LD) or high density (HD)) The mean percentage (\u00b1 SEM) of each category in relation to the total number of cells was calculated. Based on the Wright staining results cells from samples that appeared to contain intracellular bacteria were stained by immunofluorescence, using specific antibodies to E. coli and E. Faecalis. The urothelial cell membrane was stained with Wheatgerm agglutinin (WGA) and the nucleus visualised with DAPI. These stained cells were imaged on confocal microscopy, to confirm intracellular localisation of the bacteria. Z-stack analysis included the top and bottom of the imaged urothelial cells. A single line was drawn through the urothelial cell on the X/Y axis, ensuring that the urothelial cell membranes and bacterial cells were included and the fluorescence intensity of each channel was measured.",

However, OAB is rarely identified as a primary diagnosis, particularly with men. Rather, it is a diagnosis that is often arrived at after ruling-out other, potentially more severe, diagnoses. For example in men, clinicians may first consider prostate-related symptoms such as benign prostate enlargement or prostate cancer. Consequently, these patients are more likely to be given a prostate-specific patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument rather than one for OAB. If, after further testing and evaluation, the patient is found to have OAB, the scores generated from the prostate-specific PRO are usually irrelevant, rendering the data and its collection effort, wasted. Given the prevalence of both OAB and prostate-related diseases, we suspect that the administration of irrelevant PROs happens quite frequently.",

All participants were then contacted at 12-24 months postoperatively, and invited to complete an additional set of the same four questionnaires during a follow-up office visit, or by mail. Of the 150 eligible patients, 101 (67%) completed the requested follow up questionnaires at 12-24 months (medium-term). Comparing the 101 responders versus the 49 non-responders, there were no statistically significant differences in terms of their mean age, parity, BMI, or presenting pelvic floor symptoms. A positive answer to the question \"How often do you leak urine?\" on the ICIQ questionnaire was used to define the presence or absence of UI.

            "text": "Results mRNA expression of the 28 candidate TFs as well as known urothelial marker genes were measured in IC specimens sampled endoscopically. IC biopsies included various clinical status, including ulcerative type biopsies (Hunner's lesion or 'apparently normal' urothelium counterpart from the same patient) and non-ulcerative type biopsies (urothelium with or without glomerulation during hydrodistension). Initially, we noted that E-cadherin expression (encoded by CDH1 gene) had a huge variation among different IC specimens ( Figure 1A , Log2 expression range: from 5.29 to 14.96, 815-fold expression difference). Endoscopic handling could have resulted in significant variation of epithelial/stromal ratio and we presumed that the contaminated stroma (i.e. submucosal tissue and inflammatory cells) significantly affected data interpretation. Therefore, we changed the internal control of RT-PCR from 18s ribosomal RNA to CDH1, thereby exclusively focusing on urothelial status. UPK1A expression (uroplakin 1A, a known marker of urothelial cells) was lower in IC biopsies from Hunner's lesion (ulcer positive) compared to urothelium from both ulcerative and non-ulcerative patients (collectively defined as ulcer negative) ( Figure 1) . Moreover, expression of other urothelial marker genes, TP63, SHH or FOXA1 was lower in Hunner's lesion. Conversely, retinoic acid receptor RARA expression was higher in ulcer positive compared to ulcer negative urothelium ( Figure 2 ). Among 28 candidate TFs, expression of EVX1, OVOL1, EHF, ELF3 or GRHL2 was lower in Hunner's lesion. Conversely, expression of vitamin D receptor VDR, ELF4, IRF1 ( Figure 3 ), ETS2, NR4A2 or ZBTB7B was higher in ulcer positive compared to ulcer negative urothelium. We noted that several factors are associated with each other and the multivariate expression data could be decomposed to fewer number of dimensions. Factor analysis reduced the expression complexity of known urothelial markers and the candidate TFs and we chose four axes for convenience of classification ( Figure 4 ). From the known markers, retinoic acid receptors RARA and RXRA were classified into the first axis ( Figure 4A , Principal Axis: PA1), and the second axis (PA2) was related to the urothelial basal cell marker, KRT5 ( Figure 4A ). Other known markers, KRT7, UPK1B, and UPK3A were classified into PA2 but these three were inversely correlated with KRT5 ( Figure 4B ). The third axis (PA3) included four markers, TP63, KRT20, UPK1A, and UPK3B ( Figure 4A ), which are closely associated with each other ( Figure 4B ). The fourth axis (PA4) included SHH and FOXA2 ( Figure 4A ). Most candidate TFs were classified according to these criteria but some were under-detected (KLF3, KLF15, NR5A2 and FOS) in IC biopsies, and EHF and CEBPG were not classified into the four PAs, due to poor correlation with other factors ( Figure 4A ). Finally, we sought to characterize IC biopsies according to these multivariate expression profiles ( Figure 5 ). Principal component (PC) analysis produced a similar multivariate classification as that obtained in factor analysis. We drew a scatter plot as shown in Figure 5 according to these four principal components. Although there was no remarkable segregation between ulcer statuses (black circles: Hunner's lesion, white circles: 'apparently normal' urothelium counterparts from ulcerative type patients and urothelium from non-ulcerative type patients), biopsies from Hunner's lesion (black) tended to be located in particular PC areas ( Figure 5 ).",

The number of previous surgeries documented included only those aimed at treating lumbosacral nerve entrapment. Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores were used to assess pain severity at each patient visit. A paired t-test was used to compare preoperative VAS-scores to VAS-scores at the last post-operative visit.

In WT mice, micturition pattern analysis showed a marked increase in the number of spots and a reduction of micturition volume in CYP-injected mice (9 \u00b1 1.7 spots and 328 \u00b1 38 \u00b5L) in comparison to saline group (2.4 \u00b1 0.5 spots and 779 \u00b1 56 \u00b5L).

Cystometric studies showed significant changes in several micturition patterns in CYP-injected WT mice compared to saline, including bladder capacity, micturition interval, voiding frequency and NVCs frequency, all of which were prevented by TLR4 deletion (Table 1 ). Interpretation of results Administration of CYP caused pronounced urinary bladder inflammation and overactivity, which was accompanied by an upregulation of TLR4 signaling pathway. TLR4 deletion prevents significantly these alterations and ameliorates bladder dysfunction.",

Median time to first exam, second exam and in between exams was 3, 29, and 21 months respectively. The original OASIS classification included 24 -3A tears, 6 -3B, 5 -3C, 9 -4 th degree tears, and 62 grade 3 tears in the era before tear sub-classification. The mean age was 28.1\u00b14.4, BMI 23.4\u00b14.1, 80% were primiparous. 28 women had a repeat normal vaginal delivery (NVD group) and 78 women had an elective cesarean section (ECS group). Two women had more than one repeat NVD, 3 women were scheduled for an ECS but arrived with precipitous labor and were delivered vaginally. Of the women who had an NVD there were previously 3A -11, 3B -2, 3C -1, 4 -1, 13 unclassified. 1 woman after a previous 3C tear sustained a repeat 3C tear. Demographic data, symptoms, and sonographic findings of the women are described in Table 1 . There were no significant differences between the groups in demographics and pelvic floor symptoms. Women in the ECS group had more severe anorectal symptoms and worse findings on sphincter analysis, all of which were considered in the original pre-labor counseling. Levator area was smaller in women who underwent ECS but this did not reach significance. For the 28 women who had NVD we compared findings from first and last follow-up visits, and these are described in Table 2 : Following a repeat NVD there was a trend towards thinning of the residual sphincter width with an increase in the defect angle but this was not associated with worsening of symptoms. Interpretation of results: This ongoing prospective study shows the evolution of symptoms and sonographic signs in women who sustained OASIS and had a repeat delivery. We did not observe more severe symptoms in women who were preselected for NVD. Women who underwent ECS had more severe symptoms, which we took into account during pre-labor counseling. Our findings highlight the need for adequate counseling before repeat delivery in women with OASIS preferably in a dedicated perineal clinic.",

All data needed to compute models, except race, were available. Additionally, we had collected at inclusion information about pelvic organ prolapse (Aa, gh, and pb measures according to POP-Q), pelvic floor strength, and ultrasound bladder neck descent during Valsalva [3] . We calculated the postnatal incontinence risks for each woman included assuming a racial value carrying the highest risk (Asian). Calculated risks were divided into 4 increasing categories (5-29% / 30-59% / 60-89% / 90-99%) and compared to the prevalence observed at 12 month postpartum. ICIQ-UI SF score was used to define urinary incontinence severity (no incontinence if score = 0; slight if 1-5; moderate if 6-12; and severe if 13-21) and Australian Pelvic Floor Questionnaire to define fecal incontinence.

We were unable also to demonstrate any sustained physiological change detected by EMG or anatomical changes detected by MRI, to account for the improvements we observed clinically. We hypothesized that the injected MSCs couldn't integrate into the damaged external sphincter and were unable to improve its functional integrity but it is still able to improve the clinical symptoms for short period may be due to its effect as bulking agent. Sarveazad et al [3] conducted a randomized double-blind clinical trial on patients with sphincter defects to investigate the therapeutic effect of injecting stem cells derived from human adipose tissue (hADSCs) into each end of the muscle defect during the repair surgery. Two months later, they followed up patients and concluded that injection of hADSCs during repair surgery may cause replacement of fibrous tissue, which acts as a mechanical support to muscle tissue with contractile function. Although in their study only short term follow up was performed, it may give us another clue for the success of stem cell injection. Early timing of injection or even during the surgery itself would give better results. Our study does have limitations: The lack of randomized control group (using sham injection, of saline for example) which would exclude any placebo effect and also help to investigate the effect of needling and injection alone on the anal tissues. The number of enrolled patients is relatively small. There is a need for larger sample of patients, with different degrees of sphincter muscle defects, in order to reach significance.",

This database contains all dispensed prescriptions of 60 Dutch community pharmacies in the Netherlands, for a period of 20 years. We applied the following inclusion criteria: men \u2265 30 years of age with a first \u03b1-blocker prescription in 2015 or 2016 by a GP or specialist/urologist from 10 participating pharmacies. We defined a first prescription to occur if such prescriptions were absent in the 2 preceding years, and only included men who were current \u03b1-blocker user on the day of invitation. Invitations were sent through the local pharmacies, using a patient identification number. In case of non-response a reminder was sent after two weeks. Questionnaires could be completed on paper or online at the convenience of the participant. The questionnaire included the IPSS, and the linguistically validated Dutch version of the revised Patients Attitudes Towards Deprescribing (rPATD) questionnaire. In addition to the rPATD -which originally was developed to collect on attitudes towards deprescribing in general -10 questions were added on attitudes towards deprescribing of \u03b1-blockers: the specific rPATD (s-rPATD). Participant with less than 3 drugs were excluded of the general rPATD. We investigated six to eight factors (the overall burden, appropriateness, concerns about stopping and involvement factor, and the appropriateness of \u03b1-blocker and concerns about stopping of \u03b1-blocker factor). Each factor was scored between 1 and 5 and the questions of the appropriateness factors were scored reversely. Additionally, rPATD included questions about the overall satisfaction of drug use and if participants would be willing to discontinue a drug if their doctor said it was possible. Information on a future RCT was administered, both on paper as well as in a video message. In the future RCT, continued \u03b1blocker use will be compared to placebo treatment in men who are still using an \u03b1-blocker after three months. Men were consequently asked for their willingness to participate in such a study when invited. We categorised IPSS score as mild (1-7 points), moderate (8-19), and severe (20-35). Using Spearman's rho, we analysed the correlations between the attitudes towards deprescribing (the rPATD and s-rPATD factors) and patient characteristics and severity of LUTS. In addition we analysed the correlation between those with the willingness to participate in the RCT. We also used multivariable logistic regression to identify predictors of willingness to participate.",

After this period, the patients' symptoms remained stable, but further significant improvements were not observed. Dutasteride is a type of drug which reduces prostate volume (PV) and relieves symptoms. If treated with dutasteride for a mid to long term period, the PV reduction rate is gradually reduced. For this reason, we assume that dutasteride withdrawal might be possible, if temporary. Symptoms following withdrawal of dutasteride have not been well clarified in BPH patients. We have evaluated (2015 ICS abstract No. 595) the withdrawal of dutasteride at the 3 month interval for the short term of six months. The result was no observed deterioration of LUTS. Few studies have focused on the change of PV and symptoms after withdrawal of dutasteride. Jeong YB et al reported the withdrawal of dutasteride for a one year interval [2] . However, there are almost no studies which investigate the relationship between LUTS and testosterone level following withdrawal of dutasteride. Therefore, we further evaluated the outcome for a year with an increased number of patients compared to our data two years ago.",

In contrast, a previous study reported significant improvements in overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS) in the TTelevated group, whereas no significant change was noted in the non-elevated group [2] . Another study reported that among patients with overactive bladder (OAB), dutasteride significantly improved urgency and urgency incontinence, especially in those who had lower OABSS, urgency incontinence scores and TT at the baseline [3] . Based on this evidence, TT is likely to contribute to improvement of storage symptoms. To date there are few studies regarding the deterioration of storage symptoms accompanied by a decrease of TT after withdrawal of dutasteride. However, this study has limitations because of its small sample size and necessitates further detailed discussion. Future studies including more patients are needed to confirm our findings.",

The primary end point was the mean percentage changes in the detected vascular surface as measured by the colour pixel Doppler (CPD). All patients were submitted to transrectal ultrasonography at baseline and at the end of the study. The CPD was assessed by a sequence of Doppler images from prostatic apex to base using a 5mm step using a stepper. The image processing software (Image J) used to manually delineate the visible vessels and calculate the pixels contained within the selected area. The total number of prostate pixels was extracted from a 3D prostate model, which was created for volumetric measurements. We calculated the CPD as a percentage of vascular surface to the total prostate volume ((Total Vessels Pixels / Total Prostate Pixels)*100). Paired t-test was used for intragroup variability and Mann-Whitney test for intergroup variability.

The only measure that assessed the impact of UI on QoL was the ICIQ questionnaire. The ICSmaleSF and EPIC measures did not concur over the assessment of LUTS. The main EPIC scores (urinary summary and bother) included items on UI, and so their profiles conflated UI with other LUTS. EPIC also did not have a specific voiding score, as its sub-score assessed obstructive and irritative symptoms combined (dysuria, haematuria, weak stream and frequency). ICSmaleSF had separate voiding and incontinence scores, as well as specific items for nocturia and frequency, which it recommends reporting separately. ICSmaleSF did not include items on dysuria or haematuria in its assessment. EPIC and ICSmaleSF both conflated UI and LUTS in their QoL impact item/scores.",

It is essential to use validated and standardized PROMs in research and clinical practice to include the assessment of patient-reported symptoms, but care needs to be taken when using scores as different measures include different items within similar-sounding scores.

In order to compose the recommendations to identify and prevent PUR, we considered the evidences that portrayed the risk factors for PUR, as well as the measures to avoid their occurrence and possible complications. Evidence was also used on the ways of treating overt and covert PUR and re-education of the bladder in cases of persistent PUR. The 48 clinical recommendations were distributed in three domains: 18 (37.5%) recommendations to prevent overt and covert PUR, 14 (29.2%) recommendations to treat overt and covert PUR, and 16 (33, 3%) recommendations for re-educating the bladder in persistent PUR. After the first round, ten recommendations were modified and after the second round, two recommendations were modified based on the opinions issued by the experts. The number of specialists per round participating in the study is shown in Table 1 . There was a gradual increase in the consensus of inclusion of the recommendations among the specialists, as the rounds progressed. In the first round, the specialists had access to the 48 recommendations without knowing the evidence that substantiated them. In the second round, the experts had access to the evidence of recommendations categorized according to the level and grade of recommendation and the 48 recommendations changed after the first round. In the third round, the experts had access to the level of agreement obtained in the previous round, to the opinion of their peers and to the 48 recommendations changed after the second round. At the end of the study, it was possible to obtain inclusion consensus for 39 recommendations, 12 (30.8%) to prevent overt and covert PUR, 12 (30.8%) to treat overt and covert PUR, and 15 (38.4 %) To re-educate the bladder in persistent PUR. Table 2 shows the distribution of recommendations with inclusion consensus \u226580%. Interpretation of results Risk factors and evidence found in the literature provided support for the development of clinical recommendations. In addition, the Delphi panel composed of experienced experts was essential in the process of validation and improvement of the recommendations, given the critical capacity and the involvement of each one of the members. The experts made several suggestions for the recommendations, some of which were aimed at semantics and clarity, others to patient safety. It can be inferred that the opinions were contextualized from the previous knowledge and practical experience of each specialist, judging, mainly, by their commitment to the safety and well-being of the postpartum patient. The Delphi panel ends when an acceptable degree of consensus is reached and, generally, three rounds are sufficient to achieve consensus, with most adjustments occurring between the first and second (3) . Even after the three rounds of the Delphi panel, nine recommendations did not reach inclusion consensus. The opinions expressed by the experts on the recommendations with a consensus of inclusion and exclusion provided important inputs that can be considered in the decision-making process. Regarding the relevance of this consensus, as the first to be carried out in this area, it is believed that it is necessary to periodically review and update these recommendations, due to the rapid evolution of knowledge in the health area.",

Reconstructive surgery is a common treatment for 3 rd degree prolapse.

Two reviewers (LC and CD) independently assessed eligibility and methodological quality of trials. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion or arbitration with a third party (JHS). Two reviewers independently extracted data for the pre-defined outcomes (LC and CD). Meta-analysis was conducted when appropriate, in subgroups (by UI type), due to the heterogeneity of samples. For categorical outcomes we used risk ratio (RR) and for continuous outcomes we determined a mean difference, both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). A fixed effect model was used except if there was statistically significant heterogeneity in which case a random-effects model was considered. Risk of bias assessment was carried out as described in the Cochrane Handbook [2] .",

Participants in the treatment group received either one or two injections (second treatment was approximately 6 months after the initial). Patients who received the placebo treatment were not included in this analysis. After obtaining informed consent and approval by the ethics committee, thirty-seven women with SUI received transurethral injections of AMDC that were derived and manufactured from a quadriceps muscle biopsy as part of the larger RCT. All subjects were evaluated at baseline and 12 months post-injection. A transperineal 3D ultrasound was performed at baseline and each of the follow-up visits. A total of 14 (37.8%) women were considered responders as they showed a reduction of 75% or more of IEF at 12 months. Univariate logistic regression revealed that the following variables were non-significantly associated with treatment success (p>0.05): age, body mass index, length of urethra, volume of rhabdosphincter, VLPP and clinical urethral hypermobility. However, as shown in Table 1 , lower ultrasound bladder neck hypermobility at valsalva, defined as caudal displacement (p=0.05), and dorso-caudal displacement (p=0.04) were associated with greater success. Univariate logistic regression for bladder neck dorsal displacement showed a tendency towards statistical significance (p=0.07) (see Figure 1 for example of bladder neck position measurement at rest). It should be noted that the strong correlations between these variables (multicollinearity) prevented computing multivariate logistic regression. When defining responders as a reduction of 50% or more of IEF at 12 months, similar results were obtained from univariate logistic regression showing a tendency towards statistical significance for the following: bladder neck caudal (p=0.06) and dorso-caudal displacement (p=0.06).",

The need for a model derives from three main motivations: i) UI is a very diverse disease: its various types largely differ for their aetiology and subsequent treatments; ii) in many countries (Italy included), it is not possible to obtain complete and detailed information on actual costs, given the absence of precise treatment protocols, a significant diversity among the different regions of the country and the lack of specifically designed cost accounting systems; iii) through a model, it is possible to assess also the costs privately borne by individuals (and their families, employers, etc.).",

The application of the model has been limited to 18-85 years old women, not living in residential care homes and not affected by disabling or extremely severe diseases. The model is based on a two-dimensional classification of UI (i.e. by type and by age: four main types, anatomic SUI and ISD SUI, UUI and -as a combination of the other types -MUI, and four significant ages, 30, 45, 60 and 75 yrs), defining modules that have been studied and analysed through the Event tree analysis (ETA) method. The event trees start with the first visit with the GP and, after a sequence of events linked by conditional probabilities, lead to a list of possible outcomes, characterised by different probabilities and costs. The combination of events and probabilities of each module depends mainly on the capability of the healthcare system to effectively attract patients and address them towards proper treatments (supply side) and on the awareness and determination of incontinent women, together with their overall trust in the healthcare system (demand side). The direct costs of DTPs have been classified into six broad categories: GP visits, specialist visits, surgical treatments, pharmacological therapy, physical therapy, absorbent and skin protection products. For the definition of the structure of the trees, the probabilities of the events, the identification and estimates of the cost components and their attribution to either NHS or private expenditure, the study has formulated hypotheses in coherence with the existing research (on Italy and other comparable contexts). When it was not possible to rely unambiguously on adequate publications and secondary data, the overall plausibility of the hypotheses has been validated with a wider panel of selected experts.",

The event tree indicates that this is mainly due to what happens after the GP visit, suggesting the opportunity of initiatives that could increase the number of women that visit a specialist instead of accepting their condition (for example, specific awareness raising projects or the introduction of limitations to the possibility of GPs to prescribe absorbent products). Another possible use of the probabilities of each possible outcome, e.g. in combination with data on incidence, is to predict the demand of specific treatments, allowing the NHS (or private investors) to better focus their investments. Focusing on costs: -the event trees of all the modules showed a very wide range for the cost estimates of the possible outcomes (e.g., in Table 1 , DTPs costs range from \u20ac 40 -outcome B.9 -to \u20ac 7.253 -A.5-B.4). As an important contribution for the studies on cost-of-illness, the event tree analysis allows the calculation of the \"probabilities weighted average cost\" of each module, providing measures that could be useful to assess the total costs for a certain population. The use of different averages could take to unfounded estimates; -comparisons between the costs of different DTP outcomes cannot be performed without extending the cost observation to the subsequent years and without taking into account also the costs of absorbent products, the indirect costs and, when possible, also the intangible costs.",

Women feared judgement or censure from healthcare professionals for not doing their exercises and blamed themselves for lack of success with PFME. Women would like to be asked direct questions about UI to provide an opportunity to discuss this embarrassing topic and to access appropriate support.",

Older people often delay health care seeking for their incontinence [1] . Awareness of the many treatment options available to help cope with the issue appears to be low. In terms of treatment and cure, the dictionary definition does not adequately consider the feelings of the observer, whether patient or clinician. As patient reported outcomes from medical treatments become increasingly important in assessing quality of care and service provision, it is important to understand to what degree patients' expectations are met as part of assessments of the overall patient experience. Likewise, an understanding of those interventions which patients might find unacceptable would allow clinicians to counsel patients regarding realistic expectations, or cater to their preferences. There are no data, which examine expectations and acceptability of treatments in older patients. The aims of this study were therefore to determine what degree of improvement in UI was desirable for older persons with UI, what treatments older patients found acceptable and what symptoms they would be willing to tolerate following treatment.",

The Leicester Urinary Symptom Questionnaire (LUSQ) is a validated ten-item questionnaire, reliable in establishing a diagnosis based on symptoms of bladder problems in both men and women. The attitudes questionnaire consisted of 28 questions divided into five different categories, including: acceptance of current problems, willingness to modify lifestyle, willingness to undergo various treatments, frequency of hospital visits, and acceptability of side effects. A glossary of terms defining terms used in the questionnaire was provided to patients. The King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) is a well validated and reported condition specific health related quality of life questionnaire. The questionnaires and definitions were handed to patients following explanation of the study along with a replypaid return envelope. As a descriptive, observational study, no a priori sample size could be calculated, a group of 150 individuals was hypothesised to provide robust data on the primary outcomes of interest, degree of desired improvement in symptoms. In addition to descriptive and summary statistics, relationships between quality of life, diagnosis, and acceptability items were analysed using Pearson's correlation coefficients. Differences in proportions between groups were analysed using the chi-squared test. Length of time with bladder problems was categorized into three groups: less than one year, between one to five years and over 5 years.",

The mean (SD) age of the participants was 77.5 (7.9) years (65-95 years, N= 117) and the mean (SD) length of time with bladder problems was 8. Table 5 ). The majority of respondents (n= 56, 85.5%) identified short-term medication as being the most acceptable treatment to them, followed by a clinical procedure with no long-term risk (n= 47, 72.5%). The least popular option was long term catheterisation, which only 6.2% (n= 113) of participants were willing to accept, followed by undergoing a major surgical operation (n= 112,12.6%). In terms of residual symptoms, patients were less prepared to tolerate frequent nocturia, persistent stress incontinence, and frequent pad use. Infrequent nocturia, and using pads only when necessary were more acceptable as residual \"problems\" (Table 4 ). Least desirable outcomes were having an occasional large leak on coughing or sneezing and frequent small leaks on coughing or sneezing, 10.3% and 21.4% acceptability, respectively. Overall 75.4% of participants were prepared to accept one nocturia episode per night. Women were much more accepting of small leaks on sneezing or coughing and on strenuous exercise post treatment (\u03a7 2 =.001, p< 0.01, \u03a7 2 =.003, p< 0.01, respectively) and having to wear pads (\u03a7 2 =.0004, p< 0.01) than men. Men reported that leaking during sexual intercourse after having treatment (\u03a7 2 =.002, p< 0.01) was less acceptable to them than women. Men reported a clinical procedure with risk of catheterization more acceptable to them than women (\u03a7 2 =.0005, p< 0.01). Patients with a longer duration of symptoms were statistically significantly more likely to report lower expectations of treatment compared to those with shorter durations of symptoms (\u03a7 2 =.008, p< 0.01).

Multiparity, menopause, pregnancy and childbirth are some of the most important risk factors for PFD. Although pelvic floor muscle training is recommended as first-line treatment and prevention strategy for PFD in women, the prevalence rates of PFD remain very high in women during the reproductive age and beyond. Feelings of embarrassment and shame, combined with insufficient knowledge and misperceptions about PFD are the largest barriers to seeking care [1, 2] . PFD remains a taboo topic and is underreported. The prevalence of PFD in healthy female adolescents (4 to 6% occasionally urinary incontinence) is low [3] , but nevertheless, their exposure to the most common risk factors (such as pregnancy and delivery) is approaching while they are growing up to sexual active young females. Therefore primary prevention should ideally start in adolescence. To the best of our knowledge, no previous research ever studied the knowledge of PFD in female adolescents. Asking young females questions about the intimate pelvic floor seem to form an ethical dilemma and may therefore be avoided. The objective of this research was to investigate whether adolescent girls ever received information about the pelvic floor muscles (PFM) and PFD; whether they are interested to receive more information about these topics; and through which canals they would prefer to get informed. In a small sample of this group of adolescent girls, the knowledge of the PFM function was also investigated. Study design, materials and methods Cross-sectional survey design. A reliable and valid questionnaire was distributed to female adolescents (12-18 years old) in High Schools, technical education and vocational schools. All participants and their parents were informed about the research goals and were asked to sign an informed consent form.

The first stimulation session was applied by the specialist nurse, who then taught the patient how to self-administer the TTNS. Following the individualised education, each patient who consented to self-manage their TTNS treatment was provided with written instructions, a programmed, locked stimulation unit, sufficient electrodes for a 12 session treatment programme, contact details of the specialist nurse and a follow-up appointment. A clinical audit of TTNS outcomes was undertaken in February 2017, 10 months following the service commencement. Clinical effectiveness was evaluated using paired t-tests to compare any differences from pre-TTNS to post-TTNS in urinary symptoms (IPSS), urinary leakage (ICIQ-UI SF) and quality of life (IPSS single question).",

Fibrinolysis reduction results in the formation of fibrous bands between organs and the abdominal wall, called adhesions.

After induction of anesthesia (ketamine 40mg/kg and xylazine 3mg/kg), 5 mL of blood was collected from the animals by cardiac puncture to obtain the PRP. After plasma collection, a midline abdominal incision was made and in each animal, two meshes were implanted: the polypropylene mesh without plasma on the left side and the same mesh coated with PRP on the right side. A defect in the abdominal wall was created, such that the mesh could be placed in the interface between the peritoneum and bowel loops.Then, a layered closure was carried out. Ten rabbits served as controls and underwent median laparotomy and layered closure alone, without mesh insertion (euthanized at 60 days). From the 20 remaining rabbits, 10 rabbits had the mesh for 30 days and 10 rabbits had the mesh for 60 days. The adhesion tenacity observations were graduated as 0-no adhesions, 1easy release of adhesions from tissues, 2 -traction required to release adhesions, 3-blunt dissection required to release adhesions, and 4-fine dissection required to release adhesions. The modified Diamond scale (mDs), which divides the adhesions according to their extent, was used. Then, the meshes were removed for analysis. The inflammatory parameters were evaluated by measuring the myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity (indirectly measures neutrophil activity) and the N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) activity (indirectly measures macrophages).The oxidative stress parameters included evaluation of ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) radical reducing ability, reduced glutathione (GSH) endogenous antioxidant levels, specific endogenous antioxidants, and the determination of superoxide anion production. The results of the inflammatory and oxidative stress parameters were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test .The results were considered significant at p <0.05. The Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test for paired data was used to evaluate the tenacity and extent of adhesions. The comparison analysis of the control group was conducted using the Kruskal-Wallis test.",

Although the group with PRP did not present differences in adhesions, the evaluation of inflammatory activity and oxidative stress indicated the use of PRP as beneficial. This result is significant since complications such as erosion, extrusion, and adhesions are closely related to inflammatory reactions to the implant. There are a few studies on the use of PRP on meshes for hernia repairs. An in vitro study with seven types of meshes with PRP achieved adhesion reduction and improved biocompatibility with its use after 6 weeks {1}. In this study, the possible benefit of the use of PRP occurred at a later stage. This agrees with the findings of Gerullis et al., who studied the in vivo and in vitro biocompatibility of mesh coated with autologous plasma and observed no effect of the mesh on early inflammatory events of inflammatory infiltration and macrophage invasion {1,2}. The hypoxia generated by surgical trauma is a determining factor for the formation of adhesions, this oxygen deficit generates oxidative stress, which is highly damaging for cellular functions {3}. Immediately after implantation and with the onset of the inflammatory response, neutrophils begin to produce oxidants. Production of reactive oxygen species, proteases, and growth factors, mediated by neutrophils and macrophages, results in tissue destruction, fibroblast proliferation inhibition, aberrant collagen accumulation, and fibrosis {3}. In addition, polypropylene oxidation produces free radicals with subsequent depolymerization, oxidative degradation, leaching, and hydrolysis. These changes result in the loss of mesh structure with changes in molecular weight and mechanical integrity.In this study, the use of PRP reduced the oxidative stress by significantly increasing the FRAP and ABTS radical reducing ability. This reduction is important for the maintenance of implant integrity. There was also an increase in reduced glutathione (GSH), an important biological antioxidant with a protective role in adhesion formation {3}. A decrease in superoxide anion levels, which increases with surgical trauma, was detected. Fibroblasts, when exposed to superoxide anions, increase the TGF-beta and collagen I levels, both involved in the pathogenesis of the adhesions {3}. The PRP usage results are very interesting because they indicate a decrease in the occurrence of adhesion triggering events.A decreased inflammatory response was observed with decreasing levels of NAG in the lysosome of activated macrophages. This is a significant observation since the concentration of macrophages at the site is high for a few hours after implantation and the real invasion takes place after 7 days. The inflammatory reaction continues for several months, depending on the material implanted and the site of implantation. This process becomes chronic over time, with the formation of small granulomas, and the result ranges from fibrosis to functionally normal tissue. The extensive presence of macrophages on site suggests a determinant role of macrophages in tissue remodeling after mesh implantation `{2}. In addition, the levels of MPO, an important inflammatory marker and an enzyme present in neutrophils, decreased with PRP. MPO is a heme-protein, which uses hydrogen peroxide and chloride ions to generate cytotoxic acids and diffusible radical species {3}. Studies have revealed an important role of this enzyme in the development of fibrous tissue, indicating that MPO inhibition could be a target for therapeutics to reduce post-operative adhesions. Thus, the combination of lower inflammatory response (indicated by decrease in MPO activity) and lower NAG levels (associated with decreased oxidative stress), potentially reduces the risk of fibrosis and other integration complications and maintains the physical integrity of polypropylene.",

Finally, 1257 checklists filled out by adults were analyzed. For the analysis the adult respondents were divided into subgroups based on gender and age. Three age groups were formed: 18-39-year-olds, 40-59-year-olds, and 60-85-year-olds. Based on their body mass index (BMI) respondents were grouped either as underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2), normal (BMI between 18.5 to 25 kg/m2), overweight (BMI between 25 to 30 kg/m2), or obese (BMI > 30 kg/m2) in accordance with the WHO guidelines. Children (aged 8-17 years old) received the Groningen Pediatric Defecation and Fecal Continence (P-DeFeC), which is the equivalent of the adult version of the DeFeC checklist. The checklists consists of the same questions. The P-DeFeC however is worded in a way that is understandable to a eight year old child.

Women and girls especially, are affected by this problem (49% and 30.1% respectively). Importantly, UI in men should not be underestimated, because 22.6% of men living in the Netherlands experiences UI as well. Our findings therefore negate the current prejudice that UI is a female ailment. Using multivariate analysis, we found that age was a significant risk factor in women only. It seems that age, as a single factor, influences UI in both men and women, but in combination with other age-associated diseases, it only correlated with UI in women. The reasons for these finding are unclear, but because men and women often experience different types of UI, and different types of UI possibly have different causative factors, this could explain why age influences UI differently in men and women. It is remarkable that in children there is no difference between the prevalence of UI in the two age groups. This means that there is no such thing as 'outgrowing UI'. On the basis of the findings of this study, we are able to confirm that in adult men and women in the Netherlands, lower urinary tract symptoms are correlated with UI -according to both univariate and multivariate analyses. We also showed that obesity is a risk factor for UI in women, not in men. We found a significant correlation between a BMI of > 30 and UI, even after correcting for age and diabetes. Finally, we found that vaginal parturition as well as the number of vaginal parturitions were risk factors for UI, while cesarean sections were not. Our finding indicates that not pregnancies, but the type of delivery and the number of parturitions are risk factors for UI. Vaginal hysterectomies increased the risk of being incontinent for urine, while abdominal hysterectomies did not. It is plausible that vaginal hysterectomies are more often performed in women with pre-existing UI. Additionally a surgeon may choose the vaginal approach more frequently in parous women, because this is easier to perform in parous than in nulliparous women. In children the presence of lower urinary tract symptoms, especially straining, intermittency and nocturia were risk factors for experiencing UI.",

If treatment objective is to strengthen PFM the choice technique must be related to a TrA contraction, but if the objective is to improve pressure dynamics is better to choose HAE. The technique to be used should depend on the treatment objectives. Hypothesis / aims of study Randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre trials with onabotulinumtoxinA 100U have demonstrated significant improvements in urinary incontinence (UI) and quality of life in idiopathic overactive bladder (OAB) patients who were inadequately managed by \u22651 anticholinergic. Incomplete bladder emptying resulting in the need for clean intermittent catheterisation (CIC) is known to occur in OAB patients who have been treated with onabotulinumtoxinA. However, there is little information on the incidence of CIC in OAB patients according to age following treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA. Thus, this post hoc analysis of the pooled placebocontrolled trials was undertaken to assess the incidence of CIC, and efficacy and quality of life outcomes, in various age groups of OAB patients treated with onabotulinumtoxinA. Quality of life outcomes were also evaluated by patients' urinary tract infection (UTI) status.",

Assessments at week 12 included incidence and duration of CIC, mean change from baseline in PVR urine volume, mean and percentage change in UI episodes/day, proportions of patients with \u226550% and 100% reduction in UI episodes/day, and with a positive response (\"improvement\" or \"great improvement\" in their urinary condition) on the Treatment Benefit Scale. The mean change from baseline in King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) Role Limitations and Social Limitations domain scores and proportions of patients who achieved/exceeded the minimally important difference (-5 points) on the KHQ domains were also evaluated.

Sample size calculations indicated that 41 subjects per arm would provide a 20% difference with an \u03b1-error rate of 0.05 and a power (1-\u03b2) of 0.80. Assuming a 10% dropout rate, we recruited 46 subjects per arm. Patients with stress urinary incontinence or stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence undergoing a RMUS under general anesthesia with no concomitant procedures were offered the opportunity to participate. Subjects in the intervention group received 200 mg of oral phenazopyridine. Because phenazopyridine stains urine orange, we could not blind surgeons, patients or staff to this effect and no placebo was used. Randomisation was blinded by computer allocation and carried out using sequential, sealed opaque envelopes. Subjects underwent a RMUS by either top-down (suprapubic) vs bottom-up (transvaginal) approach, per surgeon preference. Preoperative demographics, intraoperative medications, blood loss and complications were recorded. A standardized postoperative voiding trial was performed prior to discharge. A successful voiding trial was defined as a post void residual volume of less than one-half of the voided volume. Subjects failing the voiding trial had a Foley catheter re-inserted and returned to our clinic 1 to 4 days later to repeat the voiding trial. Pain scores were obtained through a validated visual analogue score (VAS) administered 2-3 hours after the surgery. Patient characteristics and surgical data were compared between groups using Chi Square, Fisher's exact test, or Wilcoxon rank sum test.",

Mesna is used for prevention of cystitis induced by CYP but can not prevent all cases. Moreover, the pathological mechanisms of cystitis have not been revealed completely. Tryptophan is metabolized to kynurenine with indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), and this pathway is called the kynurenine pathway. The two important metabolites in the kynurenine pathway are kynurenic acid (KYNA) and quinolinic acid (QUIN). KYNA is made from kynurenine by kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT), which has neuroprotective activity. On the other hand, QUIN has a neurotoxic property and is made with 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid oxygenase (HAAO). The amount of IDO in the cerebrospinal fluid is increased by inflammation [1] . However, the relationship between the kynurenine pathway and cystitis has not been reported. Thus, we examined the role of the kynurenine pathway in bladder function by using a rat model of cystitis induced by CYP.",

The bladder weight-to-body weight ratio of the cystitis models was significantly higher than that of the control rats (p < 0.01). In the cystitis models, the mRNA expression level of IDO1 in the bladder was approximately 23 times as much as the levels in the control rats (p < 0.01, Figure 1 left), and that of HAAO was increased to twofold that of the control rats (p < 0.01, Figure 1 middle). On the other hand, the expression level of KAT1 did not significantly change between the two groups (Figure 1 right) . The kynurenine and tryptophan levels in the urinary tissues from the cystitis rats were upregulated about 18 times ( Figure 2 ) and twice more, respectively, than those in the urinary tissues from the control rats. Interpretation of results Shortening of intercontraction intervals and hypertrophy of the bladder are known symptoms of cystitis. In this study, these symptoms were observed as in existing reports. In the bladder of the cystitis models, the mRNA expression level of IDO significantly increased and the kynurenine content also increased in comparison with those in the control rats. These data suggest that the tryptophan metabolism in the kynurenine pathway in the bladder was promoted by cystitis induced by CYP. Moreover, our results suggest that the production of QUIN increased on the basis that the mRNA expression level of HAAO, the producing enzyme of QUIN, increased. QUIN is known to act as a neurotoxin, so we speculated that QUIN acted on the sensory nerves of the bladder and that the increase in QUIN was a factor that shortened the micturition intervals in the cystitis rats.",

Topical vaginal estrogen therapy has been shown to decrease the risk of recurrent UTIs in postmenopausal patients, but the mechanism of action is still unclear [3] .

Management of these symptoms with conservative interventions such as long-term use of incontinence pads presents a considerable cost burden to patients and healthcare systems. OnabotulinumtoxinA has been shown to significantly reduce UI and improve patients' quality of life and their perception of treatment benefit in two large, randomized, placebocontrolled, phase 3 trials. There are few published reports on the real-world use of onabotulinumtoxinA in everyday clinical practice. This prospective real-world study examined the efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA and the practical impact of urinary symptom improvements on OAB patients' daily lives, including the use of incontinence products and the frequency of the need to urinate.",

All patients were inadequately managed by \u22651 anticholinergic and had to be willing to initiate clean intermittent catheterisation if necessary. Patients who had ever received botulinum toxin treatment for OAB or had received treatment with any type A botulinum toxin in the preceding 18 months were excluded. Patients were treated with onabotulinumtoxinA, and treatment details, retreatment, or discontinuation of therapy were decided by the physician. Assessments at week 12 post-treatment included mean number of incontinence products used, concomitant use of anticholinergic/other OAB therapies, mean (co-primary endpoint) and percentage change in UI episodes/day, proportions of patients with a positive response (\"improvement\" or \"great improvement\" in their urinary condition) on the Treatment Benefit Scale (TBS; co-primary endpoint), mean and percentage change in urgency UI (UUI) episodes/day, and proportions of patients with \u226550% and 100% reduction in UI and UUI episodes/day.

The goal was to develop a conceptual framework to guide a LUTS prevention research program among girls and women across the life course. Prevention science is the application of scientific methodology to prevent or moderate major human dysfunction before it occurs. It involves the systematic study of potential risk and protective factors for illness and health, as well as the development of prevention interventions that attempt to change selected risk and protective factors. The prevention science paradigm progresses through phases of translational research, spanning from basic research to effectiveness trials of prevention interventions in real world settings. A key strategy in developing a prevention research program is to devise a conceptual framework that can direct the study and analysis of potential risk and protective factors across different levels of biology and the social ecology within which the individual interacts through the life course. Conceptual frameworks can also aid in identifying potential opportunities for prevention intervention. Our aim was to adopt a conceptual framework to assist in the development of a prevention science agenda for LUTS and promotion of bladder health.",

The consortium developed a conceptual framework of bladder health that was informed by traditional social ecological models of public health, biopsychosocial models of health, Glass and McAtee's Society-Behavior-Biology Nexus, life course perspectives and the World Health Organization's Conceptual Framework for Action on Social Determinants of Health. Methods of conceptual framework development included (1) defining levels of social ecology and biology that are relevant to the preservation of bladder health/prevention of LUTS, (2) generating potential risk and protective factors within different levels of social ecology and biology, (3) prioritizing risk and protective factors for study by the consortium, and (4) developing research themes based on categorized risk and protective factors. In addition, the consortium delineated life course periods that are relevant to the prevention of LUTS in females. Table 1 shows a sample of potential risk and protective factors for LUTS and bladder health that were identified by the consortium. Factors are organized by levels of social ecology and biology. Over 600 potential risk and protective factors were generated by the consortium; these were condensed into 44 broad categories of factors, from which eight research themes emerged and were prioritized: (1) Toileting environment/access/habits/techniques; (2) Pregnancy and childbirth; (3) Personal physical health/medical conditions; (4) Musculoskeletal function/ pelvic floor health/muscle awareness; (5) Lifestyle behaviors (e.g., fluid intake, hydration management, dietary factors, smoking, sexual behaviors); (6) Stress and mental health; (7) Infections and microbiome; and (8) Hormonal status across the lifespan. Risk and protective factors that may be particularly salient and influential during different periods of the life course were identified. In identifying life course phases, risk factors were noted when they typically begin to be observed within a developmental period. Chronological age was deemed not as relevant as developmental status and events relevant to bladder health. Interpretation of results A conceptual framework was developed based on potential risk factors for LUTS and protective factors for bladder health at different developmental periods of the life course in women. This framework incorporated the interaction between social ecology and biologically-based predispositions towards health or disease and the embodiment of societally constructed risk and protective factors.",

At 12 years ago we had made an epidemiological study of PNE in Chinese children and find that PNE incidence in 5 to 8 years old children is about 10%, which is significant less than that in western country(more than 15% -20% of children by the age of 5, which decreases to 1%-2% by the age of 17). However, 19.56% incidence of enuresis is found in present study, significant increase comparing to those of 12 years ago. We strive to seek the reason, once again made epidemiological investigation again in the same city and found main reasons might be due to using diaper. Therefore, we collect the information of duration, frequency, usage of using diapers , age, gander, inhabitation (living in rural or urban areas), arousal dysfunction, associated daytime symptoms and family history as well as inquiry about how the infants and children were raised including whether using toilet training, and any urination and defecation function disturbance. The result indicated that more diapers that used the higher of the enuresis in children. Chi-square and rank analysis are used to analysis the above information, the differences are statistically significant. In recent 2 decades, a rapid growth in usage of diapers in mainland of China, and the diaper using do decrease the labour of parents to take care of the infants. From 1998 to 2016, the usage of diaper number increased from 0 to 24 billion. Considering the number of children included in this study is not enough to make detail analysis, more investigation is needed in the future, to find the relationship between the using of diapers and incidence of urinary incontinence in children.",

A previous study suggested that TRPM8 channels have a role in activation of bladder sensory pathways at least partly through mechanosensitive C-fibres during bladder filling in rats [2] . In addition, another study demonstrated a significantly increased number of TRPM8-immunoreactive nerve fibres in the bladder suburothelium taken from patients with overactive bladder and painful bladder syndromes, and its correlation with clinical symptoms of pain and urinary frequency [3] . These findings suggest that TRPM8 channels may play a pathophysiological role in the development of bladder hypersensitive disorders via activation of mechanosensitive bladder afferents. However, there have been no studies directly investigating pathophysiological roles of TRPM8 channels in a model of hypersensitive bladder. In this study, we examined the effect of KPR-2579 (KPR), a novel selective TRPM8 antagonist, on deep body temperature and acetic acid (AA)-induced bladder hyperactivity by cystometry (CMG) and measuring primary bladder single-unit afferent activities (SAAs) in rats.",

Through a laminectomy, fine filaments were dissected from the left L6 dorsal roots and placed across a bipolar electrode for monitoring SAAs. Nerve fibers primarily originating from the bladder were identified by electrical stimulation of the left pelvic nerve and by bladder distension. Nerves with conduction velocities (CVs) more than 2.5 m/second were designated as A\u03b4-fibers and those with CV less than 2.5 m/second as C-fibers.

The rats in groups 2-4 underwent ligature of bilateral internal iliac arteries. The rats in group 1 were subjected to sham surgery. Anagliptin was administered to the rats in the form of CE-2 mixed with anagliptin (final concentration, 0.3% anagliptin). Liraglutide (300 \u03bcg/kg) was injected subcutaneously. After 4 weeks, blood glucose levels, DPP-4 activity, and GLP-1 levels were measured, and cystometry (80 \u03bcL/min) was performed for all the rats.",

In group B, 50 \u03bcg/kg L-748,337, a selective \u03b23-adrenoceptor antagonist, was injected IV prior to 10mg/kg mirabegron in 5 rats. In group C, 3 mg/kg propranolol, a non-selective \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist, and 50 \u03bcg/kg L-748,337 was injected IV to inhibit all 3 \u03b2-adrenoceptor subtypes; and then 10 mg/kg mirabegron was injected in 5 rats. Before drug administration, the T8-9 spinal cord was transected to block the spino-bulbo-spinal voiding reflex under isoflurane anesthesia. Thereafter, a PE60 catheter and a microtransducer-tipped catheter were inserted into the bladder through the dome and into the mid urethra from the external urethral orifice, respectively. Then, LPP (leak point pressure), UBP (urethral baseline pressure), and dUP (differential values of urethral pressure during intravesical pressure elevation) were measured before and after drug administration under urethane anesthesia. LPP was defined as the intravesical pressure at which the fluid leakage occurred by increasing the intravesical pressure gradually using a water reservoir connected to the bladder. UBP was measured as the urethral pressure maintained stable at 0 cmH2O intravesical pressure for more than 2 minutes. dUP was measured in the mid urethra at 10-14 mm from the urethral meatus and defined as the greatest urethral pressure differential value just prior to the fluid leakage when the intravesical pressure was gradually elevated (Fig. 1) . For statistical analysis, Wilcoxon's signed rank test was used to compare the changes in parameters within the same group, and Mann-Whitney U test among the different groups.",

Diabetic bladder dysfunction is characterized by an early compensatory phase in which bladder smooth muscle (BSM) is hyperactive, followed by a late stage in which the bladder contracts less efficiently. While it appears that a loss in neuromuscular transmission might be responsible for the late decompensated stage of diabetic bladder, the mechanism leading to BSM hyperactivity in the early phase remains unclear. Our previous findings in an animal model of type 2 diabetes showed that the increased BSM contractility in the early stage of diabetes was correlated with upregulation of Rho signaling and increased myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation. In other smooth muscle systems, Rho-associated signaling is regulated by caveolae [1] , specific membrane microdomains enriched in cholesterol that play a pivotal role in regulating tissue contractility.

The effect of hyperglycemia on the contractile response to CCh stimulation was investigated in the presence of a Rho kinase inhibitor (Y27632), using a dose that does not affect the response to CCh under normal glucose conditions (1\u00b5M). The response to CCh under hyperglycemic conditions was also determined after depletion of caveolae, achieved by incubation with methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (m\u03b2CD, 10mM, 1 hour). For molecular studies, hyperglycemia-induced changes in myosin light chain phosphorylation (pMLC) were analyzed by western blot. The molecular interaction between Rho associated protein kinase 2 (ROCK-2) and caveolin proteins in mouse BSM tissue were investigated by immunoprecipitation experiments. High glucoseinduced changes in caveolin protein expression in BSM tissues from db/db mice, an animal model of diabetes, was compared with non-hyperglycemic control mice.",

This current is known in several tissues including neural, cardiac, and gut, and has recently been identified in human and rat bladders. It serves variously as the feedback current in neural oscillators, membrane potential stabilization, and regulator of susceptibility to excitatory potentials. It is activated by hyperpolarization, and its dynamics enhanced by intracellular cyclic nucleotides. Mouse cystometric evidence suggests enhanced sympathetic-mediated detrusor muscle relaxation with advancing age. This could underpin the loss of bladder volume sensitivity in older humans, associated with an increased risk of urinary dysfunction.

The dosage of the antibody was determined according to previous studies [1, 2] and our preliminary experiments. Bladder afferent neurons were labelled by axonal transport of Fast Blue (FB), a fluorescent retrograde tracer, injected into the bladder wall at 3 weeks after SCI. Four weeks after SCI, freshly dissociated L6-S1 DRG neurons were prepared. Whole cell patch clamp recordings were performed in FB positive neurons (=bladder afferent neurons). After recording APs or Kv currents, capsaicin sensitivity was identified by a transient inward current evoked by capsaicin application. Two major types of Kv currents expressed in small-sized DRG neurons, namely slow decaying A-type K + (slow KA) and sustained delayed rectifier-type K + (sustained KDR) currents were evaluated [3] . In these neurons, slow KA currents are activated by depolarizing voltage steps from hyperpolarized membrane potentials and inactivated when the membrane potential is maintained at a depolarized level more than -40 mV [3] , therefore, slow KA currents are estimated by the difference in these currents activated by depolarizing voltage pulses from a holding potential (HP) of -40 mV and from a HP of -120 mV (see Fig. 2 ).",

NGF neutralization in SCI mice ameliorates the hyperexcitability by reversing the KA current reduction. In addition, SCI induces somal hypertrophy of these neurons in mice as evidenced by greater cell diameter and input capacitance, which is proportional to membrane surface area; however, these morphological changes are not affected by NGF neutralization in SCI mice.

DU is present in 9 -48% of men and 12-45% of elder women undergoing urodynamic evaluation for non-neurogenic LUTS (1) . A diagnosis of detrusor underactivity is possible neither by LUTS nor by uroflowmetry, but only by pressure flow study. Detrusor contractility is one aspect in detrusor underactivity, can be evaluated by projective isovolumetric pressure (PIP) (2) and Watt factor (3). Especially PIP1 can be used to evaluate detrusor contractility in elderly women. PIP1 is defined by the formula, that is, Pdet@Qmax + Qmax, which is obtained by pressure flow studies. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of weak detrusor contractility in elderly women at our hospital.",

A very experienced urologist prior to the UD took history and physical examination of patients and evaluated the correspondence between clinical and urodynamic P-SUI. We evaluated the number of women in whom the clinical diagnosis of P-SUI was changed after the execution of UD. Moreover, we estimated the number of unnecessary intervention after UD. We estimated the exact cost of a single urodynamic investigation including human resources (one medical doctor, one nurse) and all the materials used in a UD test. An additional economical evaluation was performed considering the National Health System refund. Moreover, it has been calculated the total amount of expense saved avoiding unnecessary surgical procedures due to UD results. Considering the National Health System refund the cost of each UD was 296,5 euros and the total amount was 17.493,5 euros. In 10.2% of the cases (6/59) the scheduled middle urethral sling (MUS) was avoided because of UD results. In 3/6 cases detrusor overactivity and urge incontinence were prevalent, in 2/6 cases SUI was treated with a conservative management, in 1/6 cases there was an important voiding dysfunction.

We developed the Uroflowmetry Quality Score (UQS) tool in order to evaluate uroflowmetry trace and inform quality [2] , including 14 items scoring from 0 to 1 (except item #2, exclusion of artifacts, scoring from 0 to 3). UQS ranges from 0 to 16 (Table 1) . First group of uroflowmetries were done following usual daily practice, and the second group after implementing the checklist based on GUP recommendations of ICS. UQS and percentage of items correctly fulfilled were compared before and after checklist intervention, using T-Test for independent samples. Comparison among urodynamic centers were done using ANOVA (post-hoc comparison with Tukey test). P-value < 0.05 was considered significant. Table 3 shows percentage of items fulfilled before and after checklist intervention. Interpretation of results Some items described in ICS GUP on uroflowmetry are well fulfilled in daily clinical practice (>80%), like uroflowmetry indication (#1), trace without artifacts (#2), patients gender (#3), scale adapted to gender (#4), correct volume (#5), postvoid residual measurement (#6). The use of a checklist easily improves uroflowmetry quality (trace and report), especially in some items not usually included in daily practice, like reporting the time from micturition to PVR measurement (#7), labeling of a usual micturition (#8) or smoothing traces (#9), s or using a nomogram. However, some others, like rounding value or Qmaxraw, were not accepted in spite of ICS recommendations (#11 and # 12) and are very difficult to fulfill even using a checklist. Not all the items have the same clinical significance for uroflowmetry quality and preferences of the researcher should be considered. Item #4 (Scale adapted to patient\u00b4s gender) didn't convince some operators who refused to change; other #13 (Results shown as ICS standard), was partially implemented. Probably because some hospitals had their own more complete-preferred standard format; item #14 (Presence of a validated nomogram) depended on the machine; and items #1 (Uroflowmetry indication included in application form), #4 (Scale adapted to patient's gender) and #5 (Volume voided is acceptable) didn't change too much. They were well accomplished before intervention and/or did not depend on the operator. It should be interesting to define an ideal checklist for daily practice. ",

LDRB is generally reported to be well tolerated. However, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) often occur following LDRB seed implantation. LUTS are common problems that affect quality of life (QOL) after LDRB for prostate cancer. As the natural course after LDRB, the LUTS peak at 1 -3 months, begin to fall by 6 months, and return to baseline by 12 months after implantation (1). The presumed causes of LUTS after LDRB are the traumatic effect of needle insertion, seed implantation, and inflammatory changes in the urethra and prostate following radiation exposure (2) . However, the mechanisms and processes of LUTS after LDRB have not been confirmed. Aoki et al. reported that prostate volume increased to 173% due to edema of the prostate on the first day after implantation, and decreased by 30% in 2 weeks (3). Although LUTS after LDRB usually reach a peak at 1 -3 months, edema of the prostate peaks within 2 weeks. Therefore, edematous changes just after implantation of LDRB cannot explain the mechanisms of LUTS after LDRB. We hypothesized that the main cause of LUTS after LDRB may not be edema or inflammation of the prostate but atrophic changes induced by radiological damage to the prostate tissue. This retrospective study was performed to investigate changes in prostate volume and the processes underlying LUTS and inflammation of the LUT after LDRB, and to clarify the causes of LUTS induced by LDRB.",

These results indicated that the severity of LUTS after LDRB is not associated with prostate enlargement induced by edema, hematoma, or inflammation after LDRB. Atrophic changes in the prostate induced by radiation may influence LUTS. Factors resulting in prostatic volume reduction, such as disorder of prostatic microcirculation, should be considered as the main cause of LTUS after LDRB. However, no strong correlation was observed between prostatic volume reduction and IPSS change in this study. Therefore, factors that are not associated with prostatic volume change should also be considered as causes of LUTS after LDRB. Theoretically, strong levels of radioactivity remain for almost 3 months after LDRB. Therefore, direct nerve damage by radiation may be associated with LUTS after LDRB.",

Current evidence has shown that stress urinary incontinence (SUI) does not occur exclusively in the postnatal period or in elderly women but also in young athletes. Several studies indicate a high prevalence in high-impact sports such as trampolining, tumbling and gymnastics [1] . ICS guidelines recommend pelvic floor training as the first-line treatment of SUI. Previous research has revealed that young nulliparous women lack knowledge about the pelvic floor and possible pelvic floor dysfunction [2] . Despite its high prevalence, SUI still remains a taboo to talk about. It can even cause refrainment or limitation of sports participation; certainly in a population of ambitious and competitive young females [3] . To the best of our knowledge the effectiveness of integrating pelvic floor education and exercises in the training of young adult athletes has not yet been studied. Thus, the objectives of this pilot study are to estimate the prevalence of UI in young adult female athletes; to introduce basic education about the pelvic floor and pelvic floor exercises in their training program; and to evaluate how this study is perceived by the participants and its influence on UI.",

All participants signed an informed consent form and minors required permission from their parents. Subjects received an explanation on the anatomy and functions of the pelvic floor, the prevalence and mechanics of SUI and the procedure for the intervention. The pre-assessment consisted of a PAD-test, an individual evaluation by external palpation of the PFMC and multiple reliable and valid questionnaires (PRAFAB, ICIQUI, IIQ). The trainers were instructed how to include PFME in their training program and were encouraged to repeat this during eight weeks. The given exercises focused on training strength and endurance of the pelvic flor muscles and also included the knack. After eight weeks, the post-assessment was performed.

Indeed, our results show no significant difference in assessing patients without urinary incontinence (UI) between phone and clinical setting. The lower success rate of MUS obtained by phone was due to a wet overactive bladder mistakenly interpreted as a recurrence of SUI. At the Cohen statistical test we gained the \"substantial agreement\" class, instead of the \"perfect agreement\", because of the misunderstanding between UUI and SUI. Vaginal extrusion was easily assessed by office evaluation. However, the poor assessment of tape extrusion during the phone evaluation was due to the lack of sexual activity and vaginal discharge.",

Integrated claims and electronic health records (EHR) datasets can be powerful research tools due to availability of detailed clinical data and ability to corroborate findings across datasets. However, comparisons of endpoints between groups may be affected by residual bias due to unmeasured confounding. This is particularly relevant when comparing medications typically administered sequentially for the same indication, as inherent patient differences can lead to identification of spurious associations. Falsification analysis, in which endpoints with no known association to treatment are identified and compared, is a recently proposed technique for assessing residual bias. 3 If unassociated outcomes appear to be associated with treatments under study, further analysis should be stopped to avoid biased findings.",

Prior to implantation and during follow up, patients were accessed through clinical evaluation, 24 hours pad test, International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5), International Consultation on Incontinence-Short Form questionnaire (ICIQ-SF), Global Impression of improvement (GII) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for treatment satisfaction. Urodynamics and terminology followed ICS standardisation (1, 2) . All the patients were operated by the same surgeon, through a perineal incision and two crural incisions (4cm lateral to the genitofemural fold). They received 2g of Ceftriaxone 1 hour before the procedure and remained with Cefuroxime for 7 days. Follow up visits occurred n 14 days, 1,3 and 6 months and annually thereafter. The sling tensioning was based on urethral retrograde perfusion pressure, reaching between 35 and 40 cmH2O. Adjustments were done only after one months. Only tightening was required, and the tension was readjusted between 35 and 40cmH2O. Clinical and urodynamic variables were correlated with outcomes: subjective success (VAS \u2265 8 and GII 1 or 2) and objective success (Dry or improvement > 50% on number of pads/day), and the need of adjustments, adjusted to the uni and multivariate logistic regression model.",

Probably due to some surgical details to prevent infection, such as distancing the crural incisions of the genitofemural fold, and the medial and anterior path of the subcutaneous hidden excess silicone arms, preventing their passage under this fold. As far as we know, this is the first study to determine the risk factors for sling adjustment.

We hypothesized that patients with known risk factors for failure who underwent placement of an AMS800, nowadays have a better survival of their prosthesis, because of increasing experience and dexterity of the operating team. Approximately 25% of the patients in G1 had had additional therapy for prostate cancer and 14% had had previous surgery for incontinence. In G2 51% and 55% underwent additional therapy for prostate cancer and previous surgery for incontinence respectively. In G3 we found an almost stable number of patients who had had additional therapy for prostate cancer, 45% and previous urethral surgery, 45% respectively. The revision-free estimated survival of the artificial urinary sphincter was higher if correction for risk factors was performed. (Figure  1 .) This could only be done for G1 and G2 because of the smaller sample size of G3 and the shorter period of follow up. Concluding message Despite the changing patient population, the survival of the artificial urinary sphincter is not decreasing.

Subsequently, these ADRCs and a mixture of stem cells and adipose tissue were transurethrally injected into the rhabdosphincter and submucosal space of the urethra, respectively. Unlike other cell therapies, this treatment is entirely autologous, does not require cell culture, and is performed as a single surgical procedure within 3 hours. Outcomes were mean daily leakage volume for 4 days assessed by a 24-hour pad test, maximum urethral closing pressure and functional profile length on urethral pressure profile, blood flow at the injected area evaluated by contrast-enhanced transrectal ultrasonography, and morphological changes of injected adipose tissue assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Measurement of urethral pressure, blood flow at the injected site and morphological change of injected adipose tissue were made until 12 months after treatment as previously reported [1] .

It was also fixed to the isthmus of the uterus by 2 sutures of 0 polyester (Ethibond\u00ae suture 0 V7 needle by Ethicon).Once the mesh was sutured, the two lateral arms were pulled retroperitoneally by the assistant through a peritoneal incision situated about 4 cm over the anterior superior iliac spine, just at the end of the lateral ports.

Her personal history included an emergency hysterectomy for a miscarriage, which had severe complications and held her hospitalized for one entire year at the time. After that she developed a stress urinary incontinence, that progressively evolved to the complete day-time incontinence she presented in our clinic. She had been submitted to several procedures, including colpocleisis 20 years ago and a TOT sling 3 years ago, with no improvement to in-continence. Another complaint that the patient had had before widowing, was dyspareunia after surgical management (patient did not know about the colpocleisis), which indicates that patient probably had \"coitus per uretram\". At examination, she had a megameatus, but as we were not able to extract more information from physical examination, she underwent a com-puted tomography and a bladder stone was identified, close to the bladder neck. After diagnosing these two findings, we submitted the patient to a vaginal approach in order to correct both defects at the same time.",

Men who needed to use pads for UI had higher depression scores compared with those who did not need to use pads at all time points, with scores highest of all for those who needed to use pads for longer. There was strong evidence that depression scores were worse in those using pads at six months and 12 months (p<0.001). The pattern for anxiety scores was somewhat similar. The highest anxiety scores were evident among men needing to use pads for longer, with those using pads only at six months having scores more similar to those without needing pads. There was some evidence that anxiety scores were particularly worse for those using pads at six and 12 months (p=0.02 at six months and p=0.03 at 12 months). SF-12 scores for physical health were different only at six months, when there was slightly worse physical health in those who needed pads compared with those who did not (p<0.001).

UI is a serious medical condition with significant negative impacts on overall quality of life. While most older women want to maintain social contact with family and friends, UI can compromise physical activity and functional independence, restrict social functioning and induce elevated levels of anxiety and stress. One factor that can influence the experience of UI is the stigma associated with diagnosis and symptoms. Individuals are stigmatized when they possess, or are thought to possess, an attribute or characteristic that conveys a social identity that is devalued in a particular social context. Some individuals direct prejudicial attitudes inward, a phenomenon known as selfstigmatization. In Western societies, the elimination of bodily waste is a private matter that is done in a tidy way. Failure to do so risks being perceived as 'different'. The onset of UI is often accompanied by embarrassment, elevated stress, and shame. It is common for individuals with UI to withdraw from social activities due to self-stigmatization [1] . A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that social disconnectedness in seniors is as detrimental to health and predictive of mortality risk as obesity and lack of physical activity [2] . Some have suggested that the incorporation of support from peers with similar health issues might be a way to better address the rehabilitation needs of clients and to diminish the self-stigma associated with age-related health conditions. Some of the key functions of peer support are: (a) assistance in daily management of health conditions, (b) social and emotional support, and (c) providing continued support over time as the condition changes. The purpose of this study was to assess how peer support for older women with UI might influence the self-stigma associated with UI and self-management of the condition. This could inform how current interventions might be adapted in order to prevent social disconnection among seniors with UI.",

Before the PFMT, the average number of urine loss episodes on a 7-day urinary diary was 20.50 \u00b1 28,47 episodes per week and the self-diagnosed severity through the ICIQ-UI SF questionnaire ranged from 7 to 16 (11.75 \u00b1 3.99). Participants described UI as a social problem. They stated that others see UI as a taboo subject, endorsing stereotypes that describe UI as dirty, abnormal, a female issue and an aging issue. Participants reported that the stigma surrounding UI is hard to break and they thought that UI is a subject that should be openly discussed. Overall, the 12-week PFMT provided the participants with 1) indirect peer-support, 2) direct peer-support that helped in daily management of UI and 3) the opportunity to disclose UI (within the group and outside of it). 1) Indirect peer-support: Knowing the other participants had UI removed the need to explain/discuss UI and may have reduced efforts to conceal the condition. Whether they use the support or not, knowing that peer support is available is comforting. Simply being in the class with peers provided women with the opportunity for social and emotional support. Participants indicated that they no longer felt alone with this condition, and felt a sense of belonging with other group members. Additionally, within the group the stereotypes associated with UI (e.g.people with UI are dirty) were demystified and not perpetuated. Rather, group members described one another as \"pretty, dynamic and intelligent women\".",

Communitydwelling women were recruited via community groups (lunch clubs, older people's groups, women's institutes, church groups, etc.) or health insurance databases. Women were eligible if they were aged 65 years or older, reported urinary leakage of at least 2 times a week and were not treated for urinary incontinence in the previous year. The experimental intervention was an integrated evidence-based continence promotion workshop that used constructivist learning and behaviour change techniques to encourage women with incontinence to initiate evidence-based self-management. The control was a general health information workshop that mentioned the prevalence of incontinence, but did not direct participants towards self-management options. Each community group (cluster) was randomized 1:1 with blinded group allocation to receive either the control or experimental intervention. The workshop (intervention or control) was delivered to groups of 6-30 women as a single 45-minute interactive session. Women were asked to fill in a questionnaire covering risk factors and continence status prior to the workshop. Participants in the intervention group received a self-management booklet. Within one week of the workshop participants were phoned by a research assistant, blinded to the intervention, for a more detailed follow-up. Participants were contacted at three and six months after the workshop. Self-reported improvements in incontinence were measured with the Global Impression of Improvement questionnaire. Urinary symptoms were measured with the ICIQ-FLUTS questionnaire (F-score for OAB symptoms and I-score for urinary incontinence symptoms). Urinary specific quality of life at all time points was measured with the I-QOL. Healthcare resource use (hospitalisation, treatment consultation) as well as falls were measured by self-report. ",

Each workshop had 5-13 participants, and was led by a nurse continence advisor and a psychologist. The first 15 minutes of the workshop comprised a nurse-led information session, while the last 75 minutes was a guided discussion by the psychologist. Usual care consisted of follow up with the gynaecologist three months after first consultation. Randomization was done using a computer-generated sequence in blocks of 1 or 2 using opaque, sequentially numbered envelopes, with group allocation revealed only at the time of randomization. Decisional conflict was measured using the validated Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) questionnaire (1), administered at baseline and at a follow-up time-point, between 2 and 6 months later. Women in the workshop group completed their follow-up surveys at a separate time-point following the workshop. The DCS ranges from 0 to 100 (0=no decisional conflict; 100=high decisional conflict). The DCS contains sub-scores from 0 to 100, reflecting factors contributing to ineffective decision making: feeling uncertain, uninformed, unclear about values, and unsupported in decision-making. Analysis was done using an intention to treat model. Paired t-tests were used to compare mean DCS between baseline and follow up, two-sample t-tests were used to compare the mean change in DCS between baseline and follow up in each group.

It is estimated that 32 % to 53 % of women present with a persistent DRA at 1-year post-delivery (1). To date, knowledge remains limited on risk factors or long-term sequelae of a widened linea alba (LA) in postpartum women, but many suggest implications for trunk control and pelvic floor support function (2, 3) . Current evidence is conflicting regarding the conservative management of DRA, which presently creates much debate amongst health care providers and women seeking care. Practitioners working with pregnant women would benefit from greater understanding of how to prevent and care conservatively for this condition. Given that what presently constitutes the best approaches to this condition needs further research to support them, we sought to bring together key stakeholders regarding this condition to develop a set of consensus-based practice principles for the conservative management of pregnancy-related DRA. The main objective of this 3-Phases study is to establish a set of practice principles to support a cohesive evidence-informed approach to DRA that can be used across disciplines. The specific aim of Phase 1 was to develop a preliminary set of consensus-based statements regarding the conservative management of pregnancy-related DRA.",

Experts were identified nationally as credentialed clinical specialists from different backgrounds and with varied experience in women's health, or determined as qualified experts from their academic and research accomplishments, to ensure the requisite diversity and expertise of the panel. All participants provided informed consent before enrollment in the study. For this initial phase, participants were invited to answer an online survey where their perspectives on various topics related to DRA were collected. A total of 82 questions related to prevention, management and assessment of DRA through the different phases of the perinatal period composed the survey. Participants had to answer each question using a 5-point scale to indicate their agreement with the statement (1=Strongly disagree to 5=Strongly agree). For the analyses, it was considered that a participant agreed with a statement if a ''4'' (agree) or a ''5'' (strongly agree) was answered. Simple proportion analysis was calculated for each statement, and consensus was established when there was at least 75% of agreement between respondents. For the upcoming Phase 2 and 3 of this study, a practice principle will be derived from the statements reaching consensus, and will be defined as an actionable item that a health care professional could enact. If less than 55 % of agreement was found between the experts, disagreement was considered for these statements and will not be included in the subsequent Phases (2 and 3) of the study.",

Among the various options presently available to facilitate bladder emptying in individuals who are unable to void spontaneously, clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) is considered to be the preferred management for preserving bladder function and reducing the risk of developing upper urinary tract damage and renal failure. Despite CIC's widespread acceptance in clinical practice, urinary tract infections (UTI) and hematuria still occur. Moreover, whether certain methods and types of catheters are more likely to cause urethral damage is unknown. This is a critical question as urethral damage resulting from catheterization can commonly lead to the development of urethral strictures and urinary tract infections, which furthermore can result in potentially life-threatening episodes of severe spikes in blood pressure known as autonomic dysreflexia. Despite this, there is little information available on the incidence, severity, and mechanism of urethral injuries related to catheter usage in adults. Furthermore, there is a paucity of data available on factors (e.g. type of catheter, behavioural, etc.) that predispose individuals who utilize CIC to urinary tract infections.",

It is well known that many different factors such as pregnancy, childbirth, age, body mass may affect the pelvic floor via a number of mechanisms. The intra-abdominal pressure increasing with BMI, tearing of the pubovaginal or rectovaginal fascia, damage of arcus tendineus fasciae pelvis or rectovaginal fascia connected with gravid uterus, engagement of the fetal head, and age may result in higher incidence of urinary incontinence connected with urethra hypermobility as well as with pelvic organ prolapse.

Iatrogenic causes include urethral catheterization, cystourethroscopy, transurethral resection, and previous urethral surgeries. Other causes include idiopathic, trauma, infection/inflammation, and lichen sclerosus. In the developing countries, the most common cause of panurethral stricture is genital lichen sclerosus (3). In our study the etiology of strictures were transurethral resection in 4 (%40) patients, urethral catheterization in 4 (%40) patients and idiopathic in 2 (%20) patients. The mean age was 50 (31-75). In the Kulkarni technique, the whole anterior urethra is repaired by a single perineal incision, single technique, and single substitute material. In a retrospective study including 117 patients with panurethral stricture disease treated mean stricture length was 14 cm and the overall success rate was 83.7% (3) . In our study we found mean stricture length 13.6 cm and %90 success rate. Most recurrent strictures occurred at the proximal anastomotic site and none of these was a full-length recurrence (3) . In our study recurrent stricture occurred in one (%10) patient and stricture site was on the proximal anastomotic site. Recurrent stricture was managed successful with direct visual urethrotomy. The major advantage of this technique is that it is minimally invasive and performed in one stage. It also avoids the psychological trauma of 2 (or more) operations and the need of living for 6 months with bifid scrotum after staged procedures (3) .

In our study erectile function deterioration occurred in 2 (%20) patients, chordee occurred in 2 (%20) patients, oral numbness occurred in 1 (%10) patient and incontinence occurred in 1 (%10) patient.

Voiding dysfunction can result from detrusor underactivity, bladder outlet obstruction, urethral sphincter hyperactivity, or inadequate relaxation of the urethral sphincter during micturition. Urethral sphincter dysfunction may be neurogenic or non-neurogenic in origin, with large post-void residual (PVR) volume and upper urinary tract deterioration. In recent decades, urologists have used onabotulinumtoxinA injection into the urethral sphincter to treat such voiding dysfunction. Although onabotulinumtoxinA seems effective in treating voiding dysfunction, not all patients have successful treatment results. Normal voiding requires adequate detrusor contractility and coordinated bladder neck and urethral sphincter relaxation. In patients with non-neurogenic dysfunctional voiding or neurogenic DSD, a decrease in the urethral resistance during voiding is needed for efficient voiding. Injecting onabotulinumtoxinA into the urethral sphincter reduces urethral sphincter resistance, but the treatment is not effective in all such patients. Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed recently treated patients to identify the video-urodynamic predictive factors for the success of onabotulinumtoxinA treatment in patients with voiding dysfunction due to urethral sphincter hyperactivity.",

Patients underwent video-urodynamic study and cystoscopy before the injections to verify they had no urethral stricture or anatomical bladder outlet obstruction. The patients underwent urethral sphincter onabotulinumtoxinA injections in the operating room under light intravenous general anesthesia. Each 100 U vial of onabotulinumtoxinA was reconstituted to 4 mL with normal saline, making the concentration equivalent to 25 U/mL. The dose of onabotulinumtoxinA was 100 U for patients with DSD, dysfunctional voiding, or a non-relaxing urethral sphincter. The video-urodynamic parameters including bladder neck status during voiding cystourethrography, first bladder sensation of filling, cystometric bladder capacity, detrusor pressure, maximum flow rate (Qmax), PVR, and abdominal pressure to void were recorded and analyzed. Treatment outcomes were assessed 1 month after urethral onabotulinumtoxinA injection. The video-urodynamic variables were compared between patients with good and poor treatment outcomes. The changes of assessment parameters from baseline to posttreatment were also compared between patients with neurogenic and non-neurogenic urethral sphincter hyperactivity.",

When we compared the baseline video-urodynamic characteristics between patients with good and poor outcomes. Patients with good outcomes had a significantly smaller volume at the first sensation of filling (122.0 \u00b1 53.2 vs 147.2 \u00b1 67.0 mL, p=0.046), greater detrusor pressure (36.1 \u00b1 27.9 vs 24.2 \u00b1 19.3 cmH2O, p=0.027), higher Qmax (7.64 \u00b1 5.03 vs 5.16 \u00b1 4.46 mL/s, p=0.017), and smaller PVR (169 \u00b1 130 vs 251 \u00b1 149 mL, p=0.006) than patients with poor outcomes. An open bladder neck during voiding was noted in 87.5% patients with good outcomes but only in 12.5% of patients with poor outcomes (p <0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that an open bladder neck was the only predictor of a successful therapeutic outcome. There was no significant difference in the improvement of symptom score, Qmax, voided volume or PVR volume between patients with neurogenic and non-neurogenic voiding dysfunction. However, patients with non-neurogenic voiding dysfunction had a significantly longer lasting therapeutic duration than did patients with neurogenic voiding dysfunction (9.55 \u00b1 4.18 vs 7.44 \u00b1 2.91 months, p=0.033). After urethral onabotulinumtoxinA injection, increased urinary incontinence was reported in 18 patients, including 6 with stress urinary incontinence and 12 with urgency urinary incontinence. Patients with neurogenic voiding dysfunction had significantly higher rates of developing de novo urinary incontinence.

It has been reported that excess urinary Ca excretion causes a decrease in nocturnal antidiuretic hormone secretion as well as aquaporin-2 production in the renal collecting tubule, and thereby affects its urine concentrating ability [2] . Thus, excess urinary Ca excretion may have an effect on urinary symptoms including nocturia; however, no clinical studies have investigated the relationship between the amount of urinary Ca excretion and urinary symptoms, particularly in adults.

It is often progressive and can result in many unpredictable symptoms, all of which can have a detrimental effect on quality of life (1) . Commonly, people with MS will report a number of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) including nocturia (1). This is defined by the International Continence Society (ICS) as the need to 'wake at night one or more times to void' (2) . Previously, clinical trials have sought to understand the causes of nocturia and have found an association between melatonin secretion and nocturia (3) . However, to date, no qualitative studies have been conducted which explore the experience of taking melatonin for the treatment of nocturia within the context of a clinical trial. This study specifically aimed to explore perceptions of this intervention on nocturia and associated quality of life impact from the patients' perspective.",

Though both groups benefited from the treatment, one interpretation of our findings suggest UBC-patients would be better candidates for RFA of the trigonal nerves. This could relate to the underlying pathophysiology behind OAB. Patients that are UBC+ might correspond to the ''myogenic theory'', whereas UBC-patients may fall in the ''increase sensory afferent theory'' [3] . Knowing that the sensory nerves innervating the bladder are mainly derived from the bladder neck area, RFA of trigonal nerves can benefit UBC-patients since their symptoms might be generated by sensory impulses originating from trigonal nerves. However, the mixed results and small sample size limits the interpretation of our results. Further studies with larger samples might better identify elements that would support patient selection.",

A survey (electronic and 600 paper based) was distributed to female nurses and midwives at three urban hospitals, between June and November 2016. An estimated 2,750 nurses and midwives worked in the three hospitals in 2016. A sample size of at least 600 was required to achieve a 95% confidence (5% error) on an estimated 56% response rate [1] . The presence of storage LUTS (urinary frequency, urinary urgency, urinary incontinence and nocturia) in the last month was determined by responses to questions from the Female International Consultation on Incontinence LUTS questionnaire. The presence of storage LUTS \"at work\" was determined by the question \"In the last month, did you experience urinary symptoms at work? By urinary symptoms we mean feeling the need to pass urine more frequently than usual; feeling discomfort because of the need to delay passing urine; needing to rush or hurry to pass urine when you get the urge; or leaking urine with work activities or with the need to hurry to pass urine?\" [2] . Descriptive statistics were used to provide information about the characteristics of the nurses and midwives, and Chi Square tests to identify any significant differences in the health variables for those with or without limited fluid intake or toileting restrictions at work. Logistic modelling was used to estimate the predictive association between limited fluid intake and restricted toileting behaviours of nurses with LUTS at work, and work impairment measured by items from the Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ) [3] . The productivity domains examined were time management, mental concentration and physical demands. Scores for the WLQ were calculated as percentage of work impairment, for example, a score of 25% indicated that a respondent was limited in the particular domain during 25% of the reporting period (the previous 2 weeks). Survey questions included sociodemographic, health and female gender data known to influence the occurrence of LUTS. Respondents reporting a current pregnancy were excluded from analyses.

While prevalence and risk factors for LUTS have been extensively studied, there has been little work in the area of LUTS prevention or \"bladder health\" promotion. This, in part, is due to the lack of a commonly accepted definition of optimal \"bladder health.\" The general misconception that a response of \"no\" to LUTS questions implies \"bladder health\" has hindered our ability to appropriately identify modifiable risk factors. Epidemiologic studies classically use this methodology to define referent groups when calculating risk factors for LUTS. But, this does not ensure that those in the referent group are without other unassessed LUTS. Yet, strategies to mitigate risk factors have been suggested based on these false assumptions, particularly during pregnancy or in older women; and there has been little to no focus on primordial or primary prevention in girls, adolescents or younger women. Thus, to accurately identify and promote \"bladder health,\" a systematic approach to defining \"bladder health\" across the life course is needed. This abstract describes the process by which a working definition of \"bladder health\" was developed to establish a foundation for developing instruments, and assessing outcomes of LUTS prevention and bladder health promotion in scientific research, clinical practice, and public health initiatives.",

We explored lessons from other health promotion research (e.g. cardiovascular health) and determined that there was insufficient evidence in \"bladder health\" to apply similar models. Thus, we proceeded in defining it using an iterative process starting with expert opinion (consortium members) to develop a framework for focus group exploration and population-based testing. Consistent with the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of \"health,\" we propose that the absence of particular LUTS is insufficient to define \"bladder health,\" and emphasize the ability of the bladder to adapt to short term physical, social, and psychological challenges [2, 3] . Further, in addition to the commonly defined phases of bladder function: 1) bladder storage and 2) bladder emptying, we identified 3) protection of the individual from infection, neoplasia, and other biologic threats as a third function. [3] This third bioregulatory function was added to reflect the increasing knowledge surrounding relationships between urothelial function, urinary markers, proteins and biomes associated with LUTS. After defining overall \"bladder health\", we used currently accepted LUTS definitions to capture various dysfunctions of the bladder and developed \"healthy\" counterparts to a variety of bladder functions. This iterative process began with a subgroup of investigators and then was validated by the larger consortium, and continues to be refined. Definitions were created recognizing that definitions of \"bladder health\" may vary across the life course; with development of continence in children reliant on bladder maturation and appropriate neurodevelopmental function, while storage capacity and emptying efficiency may change with advanced age.",

When compared to open techniques, robotic abdominal sacrocolpopexy is associated with less blood loss, shorter lengths of stay, and longer operative times. The present randomized study compares laparoscopic sacropexy (LSC) and robotic assisted sacropexy (RASC) in women with advanced pelvic organ prolapse (POP) to demonstrate the equivalence between the two techniques Study design, materials and methods Consecutive patients referred to our tertiary Department of Urology for symptomatic stage >II POP according to the POP-Q classification were prospectively randomized to test the clinical equivalence of RASC and LS, using a predetermined computergenerated randomization code. The local ethics committee approved the study . All patients signed an informed consent. Preoperative evaluation included detailed medical and urogynaecological surgery history, evaluation of storage symptoms, voiding symptoms, urinary incontinence (ICS standardization) and sexual activity, clinical examination, urodynamic study.

Patients were followed up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery, and then annually. At each visit, patients underwent clinical examination, evaluation of urinary and sexual symptoms, uroflowmetry with PVR measurement and Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI) questionnaire. Furthermore patients completed self-administered UDI-6 and IIQ-7 questionnaires annually and FSFI at 1 and 2 years.

In hematoxyline eosin stain, lymphcyte and macrophage infiltration into glandular and stromal area were shown in the lateral prostatic tissue section from HFD while ND did not demostate inflammatory cell infiltration. Additionally, masson's trichrome stain demonstrated increased collagen fiber in the stroma of the lateral prostate of HFD compared to ND. Protein levels of IL1\u03b1, IL1\u03b2, IL6 and MCP-1 were significantly increased compared to ND (P < 0.05). In contrast, protein levels of IL10 was significantly decreased in HFD compared to ND (P < 0.05) (Figure1) . Furthermore, RT-qPCR revealed significantly increased mRNA level of ER\u03b1 and GPER in HFD compared to ND (Figure2).",

In all patients, bladder diary of 3 days with incorporation of 5 stratified urgency scaling at each voiding or urgency episode, patient-perceived bladder condition (PPBC), prostatic ultrasonography, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and uroflowmetry with residual urine check were examined. All patients received tamsulosin 0.2mg and solifenacin 5mg daily. 12 weeks later, IPSS, OABSS, PPBC, patient-received treatment benefit (PPTB), bladder diary and uroflowmetry were examined again. According to baseline urgency severity, patients were divided as 2 or more urgency per day (group I) and urgency less than 2 times per day (group II). Comparisons between the 2 groups about the various parameters was made using independent T-test. P-value less than 0.05 was regarded as significant. Interpretation of results Patients with more severe urgency have the worse baseline subjective bladder condtition but this difference attenuates after treatment. This means that patients with severe urgency appear to experience more treatment benefit with anticholinergics and alpha blocker than those with less severe urgency.",

The ICIq-OAB survey question 5a (\"Do you have to rush to the toilet to urinate?\") was used to categorize participants: those who answered 3 (\"most of the time\") or 4 (\"always\") were considered to have OAB. In the accelerated hydration study, OAB participants drank 2L of Gatorade-G2\u00ae as rapidly as possible and then completed two fill/void cycles while recording real-time sensation. In the UDS study, participants underwent cystometric filling at a rate of 10% expected capacity per minute based on the maximum voided volume recorded on a three day bladder diary. All participants recorded real\u2212time sensation (0-100% scale) using a touch-screen sensation meter [1] . A two-tailed power study with significance level of 0.05 and power of 80% was performed in R using previously published data [2] comparing bladder volumes in OAB patients at different sensations resulted in a sample size of 7 (6.22) people in each group would be required, but this study aimed to recruit 14 in each group to account for participants who may fail to complete the protocol or to have non-evaluable data. The UDS fill volume (550.4 ml) was less than the total volume of the hydration fills, but this was only significant compared to fill 1 (p = 0.033 compared to fill 1, p = 0.064 compared to fill 2). During accelerated hydration there was a left-shift in the sensationcapacity curve from fill1 to fill2 at 15-20%, 35-40%, and 85% sensation levels (Fig. 1A) . During UDS, the sensation-capacity curve was significantly lower than hydration fill 1 at 75-95% sensation (Fig1B). Percent capacity was also significantly lower for UDS when compared to hydration fill 2 at lower sensation levels (45-55% and 65% sensation) (Fig. 1C) .",

This suggests that the roles of desensitization and training may play more important roles than bladder muscle biomechanics in individuals with OAB. Interestingly, our previously published study showed the opposite result (right-shift) during hydration for asymptomatic volunteers (1) . The UD curve (fastest fill) initially lay between the curves for hydration fill 1 and fill 2 and was generally closer to fill 1 despite utilizing a much faster fill rate. This, again, may indicate that the identified left shift is an effect of desensitization and/or training as opposed to a biomechanical viscoelastic change. A study in rats showed a large increase in fill rate in a second cystometric bladder fill rate sometimes decreased afferent nerve response, demonstrating desensitization [3] . These results may indicate that desensitization is common in humans with OAB and may provide rationale for more behaviour-based rather than pharmacologic treatments in this population.",

Differences between fill 1 and fill 2 reveal dynamic characteristics of the bladder that cannot be identified by a single UDS fill and suggest that bladders in subjects with OAB may undergo acute changes in bladder compliance, tone, training, sensitization, and other factors. This type of real-time sensation metrics could ultimately be used to identify sub-groups of OAB patients that would respond better to behavioural interventions (right-shifted sensation-capacity curve in fill 2 vs. 1) and those that might have purely biomechanical defects (left-shifted sensation-capacity curve in fill 2 vs. 1).",

Indeed, a flatten-shape duct is not ideal to pass fluid making vorticity whereas a round-shape duct can keep enough space to make vorticity. Althoug fluid dynamics may be important to understand pathology of BPH patients, there are no clinical method to assess fluid dynamics including vorticity passing urethra. Therefore, to establish methodology is one of the most important problems to assess LUT in the aspect of fluid dynamic. On the other hand, color Doppere ultrasonography (CDUS) is common clinical modality to evaluate fluid dynamics in blood circulation. Herein, we attempted to observe fluid dynamical characteristics of urine flow in male urethra using CDUS. As the first step of fluid dynamical assessment of LUT, urine flow was observed using CDUS in the prostatic urethra with enough space for flow direction observation, just after transurethral surgery for BPH.

Moreover, the Doppler signals in the prostatic urethra, red and blue signals made clear contrast alternately.

(Fig. 2E, F) Interpretation of results Using transabdominal CDUS, the directions of urine flow in the prostatic urethra were successfully observed in this method. The red and blue Doppler signals showed clear contrast in prostatic urethra alternately. These findings indicted that urine flow in the prostatic urethra is vorticity to reduce the flow resistance. (Fig. 2G, H) This phenomenon is rational in the aspect of fluid dynamics. Micro bubbles generated by transurethral coagulation assisted to see urine flow in the urinary bladder outside of CDUS windows. This method is helpful to conduct fluid dynamical assessment in LUT widely. This is the first report to assess urine flow in the aspect of fluid dynamics using CDUS, and to observe vorticity in prostatic urethra just after HoLEP. Indeed, there are many limitations, such as general anesthesia, position, and condition just after surgery. However, possibility of fluid dynamical assessment was shown in these results.

If patients show a successful response to test stimulation, a permanent device is implanted. Success is defined as more than 50% improvement in voiding diary parameters. Currently, the frequency, voided volume per void and number of leakages are the parameters used for evaluation of treatment effect. However, bladder sensations such as urgency and bladder fullness can also be documented by the use of sensation-related bladder diaries (SR-BDs). It has been previously shown that bladder sensations differ between OAB patients and healthy volunteers. Furthermore, SR-BDs could be used to evaluate treatment effect. The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of SNM on bladder sensations in patients with OAB.",

Main underlying diagnosis was urinary retention in 46 patients, painful bladder syndrome in 5, chronic pelvic pain in 5, urge urinary incontinence in 11, urgency frequency in 24, constipation in 1 and fecal incontinence in 2. Fourteen patients were tested on each side in two distinct surgical procedures with a total of 108 first stage procedures performed. Length of follow-up was 6 weeks in 16 patients, 8 weeks in 51 and 12 weeks in 27. Each patient received standard in-office training about management of external cable. Since the introduction of staged procedure in 2002 we've been tunneling the extension cable through the flank to the abdominal wall. Anterior tunneling facilitates management of the external cable to be connected to external power source. It's easier for the patient to handle and dress a cable exiting the abdominal wall than the back. Follow-up controls were performed weekly as standard in-office procedure in 71 patients, as weekly telephone consultation for the first three weeks followed by an in-office procedure at the first month in 23 patients. As regards stimulation programming, Pulse Width (PW) was maintained in a range between 180 and 270 microseconds. Frequency (Pulse Rate, PR) was tailored to the underlying diagnosis: 5 pps in urinary retention due to detrusor underactivity, 40 pps in urinary retention due to dysfunctional voiding, 10 to 21 pps in urge urinary incontinence and urgency/frequency. In pelvic pain and painful bladder syndrome we used 70 to 85 pps. Electrode polarity was chosen based on the lowest stimulation threshold. In all of the patients with weekly in-office follow-up visits PR was changed at each control. The remnant 23 patients started with PR tailored to the underlying diagnosis and it was eventually changed at the first in-office control.",

The principal advantage of bipolar technology is avoiding dilution hyponatremia with the use of isotonic irrigation, therefore reducing the risk of TUR syndrome. Results from randomized clinical trials (RCT)-based meta-analysis concluded that B-TURP is preferable due to a more favourable safety profile defined by less bleeding (lower blood transfusion and lower clot retention rates), no instance of TUR syndrome, shorter catheterization with a significant lower hospitalization length. B-TURP can coagulate small venous bleeding providing a clearer image during prostate resection in comparison to M-TURP, therefore leading to a decrease in operation time. The results of our study showed a statistical difference between the 2 groups in favor of the bipolar group in terms of blood transfusion rates, and/or hematuria requiring intervention as well as in days of catheterization (even though these last two data were not significant).

Consequently in the research, we apply the national database to investigate whether the statins reduces the risk of acute urinary retention (AUR) and receiving transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) in the outpatients of genitourinary clinic. In the group of statins users, the percentage (10.47%) of receiving TURP in patients with medication of \u03b1-blockers and/or 5\u03b1 reductase inhibitors is significantly lower than that (11.84%) of patients without \u03b1-blockers and/or 5\u03b1 reductase inhibitors (p < 0.001). Inconsistently in statins users with occurrence of AUR, the percentage of AUR showed no significant difference between patients with and without BPH medication.

However, the other pathophysiology of nocturnal polyuria in PD has not been known. Recently, the association between melatonin secretion and nocturia in elderly individuals is reported.

More detailed investigation such as evaluation of the single-cell RT-PCR of the neuronal cells in L6 DRG innervating the bladder are needed. Interestingly, mRNA expression of TRPM2 channel, which is known to contribute to inflammatory and neuropathic pain (3), was up-regulated in the bladders of both WT and TRPA1-KO mice with LPS-instillation, suggesting that TRPM2 channel would be further explored as a target for bladder inflammatory pain disorders.",

Although NGF is associated with nerve regeneration, this protein might not act as a biomarker to predict bladder function recovery in DU bladders. Interestingly, we found urinary BDNF level was significantly elevated in patients with DU but not in DHIC and DO. The urinary BDNF level in DU patients with bladder function recovery was significantly higher than that in the control group and patients without recovery. These results suggest that urinary BDNF might be a better biomarker to predict bladder function recovery in patients with DU. Increase of urinary NGF and BDNF levels not only reflect the increase of protein secretion under pathological conditions, but also is seen in part of DU patients with bladder function recovery, suggesting a process of nerve regeneration is undergoing. The results of this study revealed that urinary PGE2 was significantly elevated in patients with DU, DHIC and marginal elevated in DO. Patients with DU and bladder function recovery had significantly higher urinary PGE2 level than patients without recovery and DO, suggesting the factors contributing to detrusor contractility are not completely lost in these bladders. The highly secreted PGE2 in DU bladders might reflect a compensatory response to certain bladder pathological conditions causing temporary low detrusor contractility. Through increase of PGE2 secretion from the urothelium or detrusor patients with DU may regain detrusor contractility gradually. Measurement of baseline urinary PGE2 level might predict the recovery of bladder function in patients with DU.",

Proneurotrophins are released initially from cells that are then proteolytically cleaved to form the mature protein (e.g., nerve growth factor). Mature neurotrophins can then bind to the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75 NTR )-TrkA/B complex to promote cell growth and differentiation. Interestingly, proneurotrophins can also bind to p75 NTR when it is dimerized with sortilin to initiate apoptotic pathways [1] . Therefore, proneurotrophins may elicit different effects to the mature proteins following nerve injury.

The two grade II enterocoeles visualised during ultrasound were also seen during MRI (both also grade II on MRI) but the grade III enterocoele seen on ultrasound did not develop during MRI. There was one cystocoele which was seen on ultrasound (grade I) but not MRI and one seen on MRI (grade I) but not ultrasound. Grade of cystocoele was underestimated by MRI compared to ultrasound in four cases (grade II on ultrasound and grade I on MRI). Interpretation of results Comparing defaecation MRI with integrated total pelvic floor ultrasound has allowed us to refine our anatomical knowledge of ultrasound. There was agreement between the two imaging modalities for the presence or absence of anatomical abnormalities. However, severity of pathology did not always correspond. This may be related to the positioning of patients or the differences in the presence or absence of rectal contrast. Ultrasound tended to overestimate cystocoele compared to MRI (which may represent underestimation on MRI). Defaecatory MRI in a closed configuration system may overestimate functional abnormalities due to difficulty in expulsion of rectal gel in the supine position.",

PVR during PFS > 150 ml also indicated a diagnosis of MSA (OR 6.030, 95% CI 2.122-17.137). 'Weak detrusor' also suggested MSA, but the relation was not statistically significant (OR 10.598, 95% CI 0.359-312.473, p = 0.172). The presence of DO and neurogenic change in EAS-EMG (mean duration of MUPs > 10 ms) did not significantly contribute to the differentiation of MSA from PD (Table) . Interpretation of results We have previously reported that urinary voiding dysfunction is more prevalent and severe in MSA compared to PD and measuring PVR might be useful for the differentiation of MSA [1] . However, second consensus criteria of MSA emphasize the presence of urinary incontinence rather than incomplete bladder emptying for the clinical diagnosis of MSA. Many neurologists might be confused with the examination of LUTD in diagnosing MSA or PD because urgent urinary incontinence is also common in PD with advanced stage. It should be pointed out that PVR > 150 ml during free-flowmetry had a large odds ratio with statistical significance. Although PVR > 150 ml during PFS and impaired bladder contractility also had large odds ratios, PFS is necessary for their examination. PFS is an invasive examination and is not appropriate for routine use. Based on clinical reliability and invasiveness, PVR > 150 ml during free-flowmetry is appropriate for the diagnosis of MSA with regard to urological dysfunction. The present study might confirm that urinary voiding dysfunction as evaluated by measuring PVR is more useful than the presence of storage dysfunction in differentiating MSA from PD. The present result also indicated that the prevalence of DO is not different between PD and MSA, which was consistent with our previous study [3] . Although we have also previously reported that neurogenic change in EAS-EMG suggest the diagnosis of MSA rather than PD [2] , the present study indicated that PVR is more useful than EAS-EMG in differentiating MSA from PD.",

Injection of 200-300 U of onabotulinumtoxinA into the detrusor muscle can reduce contractility, improve bladder compliance, and restore urinary continence in patients with NDO. Currently, a 200 U single injection of onabotulinumtoxinA into the detrusor has been recommended as standard treatment for NDO. However, the therapeutic duration of this dosage on NDO was shorter than that of a 300 U injection. Most studies of onabotulinumtoxinA on NDO come from animal models, and only a few human studies have been noted. The current study investigated changes in urothelial dysfunction and sensory protein expression in the bladder urothelium with time after a single onabotulinumtoxin injection in SCI patients.",

Storage symptoms improved probably for the disappearance of the obstructive effect of POP but the persistence of them in more patients compared voiding symptoms maybe was linked to other causes such as the aging. Women with NIC decreased after surgery, as effect of the disappearance of the obstruction, however they persisted in 1 patients with OAB symptoms, demonstrating different physiopathological causes .In according to PIP detrusor underactivity improved in 6 women after LSC probably for low degree of underactivity .",

            "text": "Due to the wide range of neurological symptoms that dominates MS, a discussion on SD may not always be prioritized, and therefore time should be set aside during one of the initial clinic visits to specifically enquire about SD. Bladder dysfunction was identified to interfere with intimacy and sexual activity. The presence of family or friends during clinic visits was identified as an important barrier, and a part of the clinic consultation should therefore remain private to facilitate a discussion on SD. Patients report not being asked about sexual problems as being a barrier (33.8%), suggesting that there is an expectation that HCPs should be initiating the discussion on SD. However HCPs were concerned that discussing SD may result in patient anxiety and discomfort; however a mismatch in perceptions exists and patients are prepared to discuss the problem. A lack of knowledge was identified as a barrier by HCPs. Interpretation of results Our study demonstrates that adult patients with CGUA generally lacked knowledge about sexuality and fertility despite their interest in these topics. Regardless of gender, over half of participants had never heard of ART, and only 1 had received prior fertility counselling. 1/3 of participants wanted to learn more about sexuality and/or fertility. 24.6% (n=14) of participants were not currently sexually active but wanted to become sexually active. A possible explanation for the discrepancy between participants' knowledge of and desire to learn about sexuality and fertility could be their hesitancy to ask healthcare professionals about such topics. In addition, a considerable challenge of this study was getting participants to complete questionnaires pertaining to their sexuality and fertility status. Despite assistance with filling out questionnaires, many participants still left them unanswered. Only 40% of male participants completed the SHIM questionnaire, a standard diagnostic aid for ED screening. This poor response rate could reflect participants' discomfort addressing sexuality and fertility in a healthcare setting. Many adults with CGUA do not receive sexual education in school, and only a small fraction report receiving sexual education specific to their diagnoses either from home, clinic, or school. [1, 2] Discussion of sexuality and fertility should occur early in adolescence in order to promote patient comfort with such topics. [3] Furthermore, these questionnaires may be too difficult and detailed for this patient population. Improvement of standard sexuality questionnaires may be indicated.",

Afterwards, the forebrain determines a person's social circumstance and whether to proceed with voiding. Once it is socially acceptable to void, canters in the brain and spinal cord coordinate to produce bladder contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation. [2] In order for the pontine micturition centre (PMC) to begin micturition, visceral sensations from passive filling in the bladder are transmitted to the periaqueductal gray (PAG) of the brainstem and higher centres including thalamus, insula, and anterior cingulate gyrus. Other neural structures associated with the voiding reflex are the motor prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor cortex, and parahippocampus. Earlier positron emission topography studies have identified right dorsomedial pontine tegmentum and the right inferior frontal gyrus to be associated with significantly increased blood flow in healthy women at the time of voiding. [3] Our fMRI BOLD signal analysis results are consistent with these preliminary data in the literature where PMC, PAG, left cingulate, left thalamus and the reticular formation seem to have different pattern of activation between female MS voiders and the ones with voiding dysfunction. All of these structures may be involved during PAG activation to transmit input to the PMC to initiate micturition.",

Our aim is to determine whether CNS processing of sensory information differs between women with OAB and healthy controls. Our hypothesis is that OAB is associated with quantitative increase in cerebral perfusion in select regions of interest in women with OAB as compared to controls.",

We selected ROIs in the brain a priori based on the existing literature of OAB and interstitial cystitis ( Ref.1-3 ). Absolute regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) for each ROI for each subject was calculated. We compared 1) rCBF at baseline (empty bladder state) between OAB and control groups 2) rCBF in the empty bladder state to rCBF in full bladder state within each group (OAB and controls) and 3) change in rCBF (from empty to full bladder) in the OAB group to change in rCBF in the control group. We also performed secondary non-hypothesis driven whole-brain analysis using SPM to evaluate for rCBF pattern changes between empty and full bladder states.",

Only low numbers of labelled cells were observed, indicating this is likely not the main innervation of the bladder. This result, combined with the increase in upper lumbar/lower thoracic stimulationinduced bladder contractility (although just short of statistical significance) after long-term sacral root transection, is suggestive of increased sensitivity to stimulation rather than an injury-induced increase in neuronal cell numbers. Beyond mediating bladder contractility, sacral nerves may stimulate interneurons that inactivate tracts originating from the upper lumbar region.

This is first report to show that sildenafil increased EUS-EMG activity during voiding in mice. A previous immunofluorescence assessment identified that PDE5 was abundantly expressed in the striated muscle of the urethra and the levator ani muscle of rats, and this indicated that striated muscles are possibly regulated by PDE5. Sildenafil has a relaxing effect on the urethral muscle of mice and rats in organ bath studies. However, previous clinical evidence showed that PDE5-Is had few effects of increased urine flow rate, which indicated that this relaxant effect does probably not explain why sildenafil is useful in LUTS -our new finding may help to account for the beneficial effects on EUS activity and possibly central nervous system, especially sympathetic neural activity, which might improve LUTS symptoms. In terms of bladder parameters, sildenafil decreased the threshold pressure and increased bladder compliance. The possible mechanism is decreased afferent firing of pelvic nerve. Some papers indicated that PDE5-Is and NO reduces mechanosensitive afferent activities of both A \u03b4 -and C-fibres elicited by bladder distension in the rat although investigation of afferent activity in mice is yet to be undertaken. The other possible mechanism is direct relaxation of the bladder which we were able to demonstrate in the pithed DAPM. This finding is consistent with previous reports and sildenafil has been reported to have relaxant effect on the human bladder and mouse detrusor showed relaxant response to soluble guanylyl cyclase stimulators [3] .",

Study design, materials and methods Female C57BL/6N (8-9 week-old) mice weighing 18-20 g were used, and SCI was induced by complete transection of the Th8/9 spinal cord under isoflurane anesthesia. SCI mice were divided into 2 groups; (1) SCI mice treated with SB203580 (1 mg/ml), a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor (p38 MAPK i) (n=4), (2) SCI mice with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (n=4). Two weeks after SCI, an intrathecal catheter connected to an osmotic pump was implanted into the intrathecal space of L6-S1 spinal cord for continuous intrathecal instillation at infusion rate of 0.51 \u03bcl/hr for 2 weeks. Osmotic pumps filled with p38 MAPK i or CSF were placed in the subcutaneous space between shoulder blades. After spinal cord transection, their bladders were manually squeezed to eliminate the urine once daily for 4 weeks until cystometric evaluation. SCI mice were evaluated using single-filling cystometry (CMG) and external urethral sphincter (EUS)-electromyogram (EMG) under an awake condition. In single CMG recordings, the number of non-voiding contractions (NVCs), micturition pressure (MP), post-void residual volume (PVR) and voiding efficiency (VE) were evaluated in each SCI mouse (Figure 1 ). In simultaneous CMG and EUS-EMG recordings, voiding contraction time, reduced EMG activity duration and the ratio of reduced EMG activity time to voiding contraction time were measured during the voiding phase to evaluate DSD in each SCI mouse. In real-time PCR analyses, L6 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were removed from CSFtreated SCI mice (n=8) and p38 MAPK i-treated SCI mice (n=5) as well as CSF-treated normal (spinal intact) mice (n=6) and the levels of TRPV1, TNF\u03b1 and iNOS transcripts were evaluated.",

As individuals we all learn differently by a combination of visual, auditory or kinaesthetic methods. It is difficult to source a dynamic visual explanation tool for the teaching of the practical aspects of bowel evacuation in a condensed and user-friendly manner. Challenges arise when an individual with a spinal cord injury (SCI) requires appropriate bowel care support outside a specialist SCI facility. As bowel care is multifaceted there is often ambiguity about the procedures and training required (1, 2) . The acquisition of appropriate theoretical and clinical skills and knowledge is a key element that underpins neurogenic bowel management education. This training should be provided in an appropriate manner in order to foster a culture of learning to support bowel care issues.",

The symptoms of PNE syndrome occurs from changes in nerve function and structural changes in the nerve that arise from the mechanical effects of compression. This syndrome presents with pain, hypo or hyperesthesia, anal incontinence, urinary incontinence and impotence.

First, the peritoneum is opened just above the seminal vesicles. The space between the posterior part of the prostate and the seminal vesicles is dissected. The bladder is then released down and the Retzius space is dissected. The lateral sides of the prostate are dissected and the endopelvic fascia is opened on both sides. A Prograsp forceps is used to open the angle between seminal vesicles and bladder on both sides from inside to outside. A measurement tape is then passed around the bladder neck and the AUS cuff is inserted through the 12-mm port. The balloon is implanted in the Retzius space through a 3 cm suprapubic incision and the pump is placed in the scrotum by a subcutaneous passage made from the suprapubic incision",

In our patient population, we have found that LUTS frequently co-exist with pelvic floor and obturator internus myofascial pain. We have observed anecdotally that a substantial number of these patients demonstrate improvement in both their myofascial pain scores on physical exam as well as their LUTS after pelvic floor physical therapy (PFPT) directed at their myofascial pain.

Each maneuver was performed twice and the ultrasound volume with the most effective contraction (i.e., most reduced levator hiatus antero-posterior diameter) and cough (i.e., most caudal displacement of the bladder neck (BN)) were considered for analysis. TPUS data was analyzed offline (4D View, Version 10.2; GE Healthcare) by an observer blinded to the digital assessment. Morphometry was assessed by measuring the following parameters in the midsagittal and axial planes (at the level of minimal hiatal dimensions) planes: (1) anorectal height, distance from the apex of the anorectal angle to a horizontal reference line passing by the inferior-posterior margin of the symphysis pubis, BN (2) x-axis and (3) y-axis related to the inferiorposterior margin of the symphysis pubis, (4) levator hiatus area, (5) levator hiatal antero-posterior and (6) transverse diameters. The shift between rest condition and both tasks (cough and contraction) were calculated (rest -task), as well as the percentage of change for each variable ((rest -task)/rest %). BN cranioventral displacement was also calculated for contraction and cough as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle (square root: \u0394BN-x 2 +\u0394BN-y 2 ). The relationships between digital and TPUS assessments of PFM function were investigated using Pearson correlation coefficient and hierarchical stepwise regression by assessment condition (rest, contraction/couch). This method was used to explore how well digital assessment variances are explained by morphometric parameters of the pelvic floor TPUS evaluation.",

Levator hiatus area at rest contributed more to predicting PFM flexibility than any other morphometric parameter assessed during rest or cough, although with poor agreement. PFM strength was associated with smaller hiatus area and anteroposterior dimension, with more cranial and ventrally positioned BN and with higher shifts and percentages of change of almost all measured variables during contraction.

They also contained a wide array of EMG calculations and comparisons for several reflex tasks, like coughing, running, rapid arm movements, load-catching tasks, and horseback riding, in different test positions. Continent women contracted their PFMs before other trunk and arm muscles. Incontinent women performed the PFMs activity later than continent women during impact loads. This was observed during coughing and rapid arm movements. Time interval in relation to the onset of other trunk muscles seemed to be important, and so did time interval from the onset of PFMs activity in comparison to the onset of intraabdominal-, urethral-and posterior vaginal wall pressure rise. Coughing significantly increased PFMs EMG activity, which correlated with the intensity of coughing. Gradual adaptation of PFMs activity was also evident for running speeds and pace of horseback riding. As for other muscles, PFMs activity during impact loads is greater than activity during maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). While running, the maximal PFMs activity varied from 98.6 to 238.7 %EMG (MVC-normalised); pre-activity (activation before heel strike; -30 to 0 ms) varied from 72.1 to 136.9 %EMG (1, 2). Posture did not influence timing, but in a neutral pelvis position PFMs activity was higher than in hypo-or hyperlordosis posture, suggesting that posture should be considered in rehabilitation.

            "text": "The initial phase of intravaginal pressure increase seen during abdominal contraction was caused by PFMs contraction. Our findings support the \"subvesicular hammock\" theory of Delancey et al. (3) . They suggest that compression of the urethra closes the lumen through its lateral attachment to the arcus tendineus fascia pelvis and levator ani muscle. This endopelvic fascia tissue stiffens under the influence of a reflex contraction of PFMs because intra-abdominal pressure increases. Therefore the stiffness of fascia is of consideration. This finding supports the thesis that the time interval between the onset of PFMs activity and the onset of intra-abdominal pressure rise are important for continence. Our review confirmed the significance of timing during impact activities; specifically SUI women had delayed PFMs activation. PFMs reflex activity during coughing is not a univocal response but a modulated reflex; it gradually adapts to the impact tasks. An alteration of the modulation of cough anal reflex showed a no graded PFMs response during impact activities in SUI women. This alteration may contribute to the pathophysiology of SUI. During impact loads incontinent women had more PFMs activity than continent women, this supports the idea that incontinence might not be caused by morphological changes of PFMs, but by altered muscle activation patterns. PFMs may maintain basal tonus with slow twitch muscle fibres, while fast twitch muscle fibres are recruited for rapid contractions. We found behavioural abnormalities in muscle activation patterns for SUI women. These findings should be integrated into a PFMs rehabilitation program for SUI women that include training control and coordinating abdominal muscle activity, and integrating impact loads to exercise and activate fast twitch muscle fibres and, first of all, their involuntary function.",

Time interval between the onsets of PFMs activity in relation to the onset of trunk muscles and relation to the onset of abdominal and bladder pressure rise, which is a result of abdominal strain, seems to be crucial for the maintenance of continence. Our results suggest that impact activities should be included in rehabilitation programs, because of their intensive involuntary PFMs activation, although we still do not clearly understand the pathomechanism of PFMs activity during impact loads. Future research should focus on dynamic PFMs activities during impact loads and could integrate the influence of stiffness from the endopelvic fascia tissue and PFMs tone into research question.",

Excluded were women with neurological diseases, rheumatic diseases, congenital skeletal muscle disorders, use of prostheses or orthoses, pregnant women, obese women and / or woman submitted to orthopedic surgery. The 1 hour pad test was performed. Then, the participant was instructed to wear tight underwear that helps to mark the anatomical points: anterior superior iliac spine, posterolateral iliac spine, with white polystyrene balls fixed with double-sided tape. The pictures were taken in a room with white background. The digital camera was located three meters away from the participant, placed parallel to the floor, on a camera tripod level at half of the height of the participant. The images were sent to the computer and analyzed using the SAPO Postural Assessment Software version 0.68 by a blind examiner familiar with the program. The evaluation of the Pelvic Floor Muscle (PFM) function was performed by bidigital vaginal palpation, following the recommendations of the International Continence Society, using the letters P, E, R and F of the PERFECT scheme. Then, electromyography (EMG) (New Miotool Uro\u2122, Miotec) was performed. Both evaluations were performed in dorsal decubitus and in orthostasis. Two surface electrodes were attached in the perianal region (position of 3 and 9 o'clock), two on the right internal oblique muscle and one on the right anterior superior iliac spine. The EMG signal was recorded by the Miotec Suite software version 1.0. A 20Hz high-pass filter, 500Hz low-pass filter and 60Hz notch filter were used. Measured were the value of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), the mean of the basal electric activity for one minute, the peak of the highest phasic contraction and the mean of the best tonic contraction.",

Exclusion criteria were indication for prophylactic cesarean section and conjunctive tissue's diseases. We collected maternal, delivery and neonatal parameters. We assessed ligamentous laxity between the 36 th week of pregnancy and the admission in the delivery room by measuring the passive extension of the non-dominant index finger after applying 0.26N.m to the second metacarpo-phalangeal joint (MCP laxity) with a specific extensometer ( Figure 1) (3). Perineal body length was assessed at the same time. Perineal tears were reported using the classification of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) and OASIS was defined by a stage 3 or more. After excluding patients who had undergone cesarean section, we reported perineal tears prevalence and the characteristics of our population.

A MCP laxity greater than 64\u00b0 was associated with OASIS with a 75% sensibility and 56% specificity. Interpretation of results Increased MCP laxity seems to be associated with a higher risk of OASIS. These results suggest that tissues with a greater elasticity could be less resistant to the perineal trauma during childbirth. This could be related to significant changes in conjunctive tissue's metabolism during pregnancy, in particular changes in collagen metabolism (2, 3) . Taking into account biomechanical characteristics of pregnant women in our risk prediction for OASIS occurrence could lead to an individualized risk assessment including the intrinsic women's characteristics This would allow allowed personalized information of pregnant women about their risk of OASIS. A deeper exploration of this research thematic may improve both our predictive and preventive strategies for OASIS occurrence during vaginal delivery. Results 12 women were included.

Looking at pathogenesis of LUTS, although multiple factors, including benign prostatic hyperplasia are associated with symptoms, detailed etiologies of LUTS remain unknown yet. On the other hand, metabolomics analysis enables the detection and semi-quantitative measurement of hundreds of unique metabolites from broad range of metabolic pathways, and these approaches can detect metabolites associated with pathophysiological states. Possible biomarkers in interstitial cystitis were actually detected using metabolomics analysis.(1)(2) In the present study, we identified metabolites from metabolomics approach and investigated association between these metabolites and LUTS.",

Chi-squared test was used to investigate the relationship between ICIQ-SF and EORTC QLQ-C30 results. Results Mean follow up was 13.5 months (median11, range 1-43).

These endings always ran along the smooth muscle fibres, with little or no branching. Complex-type endings in the detrusor muscle were the most common ending located in the mouse bladder, accounting for 44% of all endings located, 75% of which were CGRP immunoreactive. Complextype endings consisted of a single axon branching into many fibres with no obvious directionality to one another. Branching-type endings in the detrusor accounted for 12% of all endings identified in the mouse bladder, 89% of which were CGRP positive. These endings consisted of a single axon that branched into many varicose fibres which lay parallel to one another and to the smooth muscle fibres. In electrophysiological recordings from urothelium-free bladder preparations, based on sensitivity to stretch, two major group of afferents were distinquished: (i) low threshold stretch-sensitive afferents (threshold 1-3 g) with mean firing rate of 6.52 \u00b1 1.45 Hz (n=7) at 30 g load and high threshold afferents",

In electrophysiological experiments in detrusor preparations, where the urothelium and most of the sub-urothelium were sharp dissected away, two distinct types of afferents: low and high threshold stretch-sensitive mechanoreceptors were recorded. It is tempting to speculate that two distinct morphological types of endings identified in the muscle layers (branching-and complextype), correspond to low and high threshold stretch-sensitive afferents determined by functional electrophysiological studies",

However, the bladders from RELAP group showed significantly decreased responses to stimulation of M3 muscarinic receptors. Micturition patterns evaluated by filter paper assay in vivo, also confirmed an increased micturition frequency in mice from RELAP group. Interpretation of results Long-term follow up of CIE mice revealed two differential phenotypes of neurologic impairment mimicking two forms of MS in humans: relapsing-remitting MS and chronic type of MS. Mice in the RELAP group expressed overactive voiding patterns, and also had decreased M3 responses suggesting that anti-muscarinic drugs may have limited effects on neurogenic bladder dysfunction in patients with relapsing-remitting type of MS. Concluding message Our study confirmed that initial neurological damage in murine viral model of multiple sclerosis can cause long-lasting alterations",

During the voiding phase, inefficient voiding is commonly observed due to detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia or DSD after SCI. It has also been shown that neurotrophic factors such as nerve growth factor (NGF) released within the urinary bladder or the spinal cord are an important mediator inducing DO after SCI [1]. It is also known that the second messenger signalling pathways activated by NGF involve activation of p38 MAP kinase (MAPK",

(3), during cough, we didn't find any influence of body position on the timing of PFM contraction. However, RT to voluntary contract PFM was shorter in a standing position, meaning that continent women were more able to contract faster their PFM in a standing than in a sitting position",

In contrast, bladder and rectum had the highest total collagen, which was associated with a high ultimate stress. Elastic fibres and smooth muscle tissue in the walls of the urinary bladder and rectum contribute to its distensibility and elasticity. Results showed, that bladder and rectal walls become thinner. In addition, rectum and bladder elastin fibres and smooth muscle cell content significantly decrease. This consequently reduces their flexibility. As a result, this could be related with frequent urination or urinary incontinence, constipation and haemorrhoids or POP. Concluding message It was observed that pelvic floor soft tissue undergoes profound histologic and mechanical changes, particularly during pregnancy and do not recover to its original status one year after. There was a connection observed between mechanical properties of the soft tissues and histological analysis",

The patients (treatment naive or pretreated) were all over 18 years of age and had symptoms of overactive bladder for a minimum of 3 months.

Overall development of all observed characteristics of patients who finished the study as planned was evaluated. Breakpoint of age at 60, 65 and 70 years were set. For each breakpoint set of 2-sample t-tests for all the characteristics and all the visits was performed to check possible differences in characteristics and treatment by age.

The numbers of the four standard surgical interventions, as per the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for female SUI [Bulking agents, synthetic MUS (TVT/TOT), Colposuspension (Open/Laparoscopic) and Autologous Fascial Sling] were evaluated over a period of 5 years (2012-2016). As a standard of practice, women with bothersome SUI despite conservative measures (lifestyle interventions, medication or pelvic floor muscle therapy) are offered urodynamic evaluation (including urethral pressure profilometry). Subsequently they are discussed at a multidisciplinary team meeting (Urologists, Urogynaecologists, Urodynamic practitioners and Pelvic Floor Physiotherapists). Women are then offered surgical options and sent the British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) and/or the British Society of Urogynaecology -(BSUG) leaflets on all possible SUI surgical interventions for their review.",

Laparoscopic surgical correction and abdominal procedures have an increasing development, especially laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (LS). The aim of this study is analyse perioperative results and postoperative complications in POP treatment by LS. Study design, materials and methods Retrospective analysis of 177 LS consecutive procedures, carried out between November 2011 and February 2017.

CM also increased caspase-3 activity, demonstrated by upregulated protein expression of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1 (PARP1) (N=5, P<0.05). Time-dependent analysis (0, 10, 20, 30 and 60 minutes) of CM from irradiated SV-HUC revealed a gradual increase in ATP levels which was significantly higher (N=3, P<0.05) after 20, 30 and 60 minutes compared to a modest increase in CM from nonirradiated cells, thus indicating a potential pathological role of ATP and purinergic signalling in radiation bystander effects. The dose-dependent decrease in SV-HUC survival by ATP (0.1-5mM) and time-dependent activation of caspase-3 and cell shrinking (N=3) in SV-HUC and/or HBF by ATP (1mM) indicated the ATP-mediated activation of apoptotic signalling in urothelium and bladder fibroblasts. In addition, the presence of cleaved caspase-3 and pronounced increase in (pMLC2-Ser 19 ) on raft sections further confirmed ATP-evoked morphological changes and cell death. Application of ATP (1mM) to SV-HUC, held at -60mV, evoked inward currents (-103.5 \u00b1 50.9pA; N=7) indicating the expression of membrane purinergic receptor-operated channels. Live-cell imaging of intracellular Ca 2+ levels in fluo-4AM loaded SV-HUC by fluorescence microscopy revealed ATP-mediated increases in intracellular Ca 2+ levels (Ca 2+ -transients). Pre-treatment of cells with suramin (pan-purinergic receptor inhibitor; 100\u00b5M) decreased the amplitude of ATP-evoked Ca 2+ -transients, indicating the role of purinergic receptors. Inhibition of P2X7 receptors with A438079 (P2X7 receptor inhibitor; 100\u00b5M) reduced the ATPmediated Ca 2+ -transients consistent with P2X7 receptor-mediated signalling. In support of these results, in Western blot experiments, pre-treatment with either A438079 or A740003 (P2X7 receptor inhibitor; 10\u00b5M), appeared to mitigate the effects of ATP by normalising ATP-evoked caspase-3 activity and pMLC2-Ser 19 levels in SV-HUC and HBF (N=3). In contrast, dose-dependent treatment with the P2X7 receptor agonist, Bz-ATP (0.5-1mM) enhanced caspase-3 activity (N=2). Similar experiments in SV-HUC with depleted levels of P2X7 receptor (50 nM, siRNA) mimicked the effects of inhibitors. Furthermore in the P2X7-knockdown SV-HUC, the percentage of cells undergoing ATP-evoked apoptosis was significantly reduced (from 37.5% to 26.3%, N=3, P<0.05) as detected by flow cytometry. Finally, depletion of caspase-3 expression (50nM, siRNA) in SV-HUC normalised the ATP-mediated increase in pMLC2-Ser 19 levels highlighting the significance of caspase-3 activity during apoptosis.",

We showed that most significant changes in UVJ are observed after first vaginal delivery with lower impact of the second and third one. The same correlation was observed in case of urethral mobility. The lowering of the UVJ position at rest, Valsalva maneuver and tension of levator ani is also correlated with age, indicating deterioration of the pelvic floor structures and function.

To date, no data has been published regarding the efficacy of intradetrusor botulinum toxin injections (IDBTI) in patients with spinal dysraphism while these patients are injected in numerous centers in daily practice. The aim of the present study was to report the outcomes of IDBTI in spina bifida patients.Study design, materials and methods All patients with spinal dysraphism who had undergone at least one IDBTI from 2002 ro 2016 in 14 centers were included retrospectively. Patients bleow the age of 16 years old were excluded to focus on an adult population. The primary endpoint was the success of injections, defined as as the combination of urgency, urinary incontinence and detrusor overactivity resolution. Datas collected included patients' characteristics, adverse events, and urodynamics parameters before and 6 weeks after IDBTI. The impact of poor compliance (defined as bladder compliance < 20 ml/cm H2O) and type of spinal dysraphism on outcomes was assessed through univariate analyses.Concluding message ICBTI seems effective in spina bifida patients showing detrusor overactivity regardless of the type of spinal dysraphism (open or closed). In contrast, the effectiveness is much lower in spina bifida patients with poor compliance bladder.

The fan-like distributed St. M in the very distal segment acts like a pair of hands holding a reservoir. At stress, the St. M contract and act like muscular pump to push the blood within the spongy tissue flowing into the LCS, and the later extend to form a valvelike structure and close the urethral lumen.Concluding message In summary, we conclude that a sluice-like structure driven by muscular pump within the urethra is responsible for urinary continence in female canine.Disclosures Funding: This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos: 30772290).

Lax anal sphincter tone in patients with neurogenic bladders makes accurate Pabd recording unreliable. Anecdotal case reports of intravaginal sensors exist. We validated a novel nasogastric (NG) abdominal sensor for Pabd measurement in urodynamics.Study design, materials and methodsThis study was performed in a referral UDS unit of a tertiary care urological centre in South India from February 2016 to February 2017. For this purpose, we placed a NG Pabd sensor in addition to the conventional rectal Pabd sensor, using the urethral profile pressure channel of an Andromeda Ellipse UDS suite and performed UDS in the standard fashion. included the line of equality thus showing good agreement. It was possible to make definitive urodynamic diagnosis in all patients using NG Pabd sensor similar to that of rectal Pabd sensor.Interpretation of resultsOur results show that Pabd measurements using NG transducer is accurate when compared to that measured by rectal Pabd transducer. It was checked at various stages of the filling phase and voiding phase.

Water-filled catheters (WFC) are considered to be the traditional standard to measure pressures during UDS. However, nowadays other manometer-based technologies, like the air-charged catheters (ACC), are available. In order to determine if pressure readings from the ACC and WFC are equivalent, we designed an original study where, a dual lumen ACC was used to measure pressure using water and air technologies simultaneously at specific filling volumes at Valsalva manoeuvres and cough movements, and during voiding.Study design, materials and methods All protocols were approved by an ethics board committee and all subjects were consented. This was a single-center prospective study. A commercially available 7Fr T-DOC ACC dual-lumen was used to measure vesical pressure (Pves) and abdominal pressure (Pabd). Pressures were continuously recorded through the ACC sensor. The water pressures were recorded by connecting a pressure transducer to the filling lumen of T-DOC at specific filling volumes, when patients were asked to perform Valsalva manoeuvres and cough, and during voiding. This method allowed us to simultaneously assess WFC and ACC pressures. Paired-differences between systems for each event was compared using linear correlation or paired t-test and Bland-Altman plot for repeated measurements, where data is presented showing the 95% interval of confidence (IC) and mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Pves and Pabd respectively;Fig.1). Paired t-test of detrusor pressure (Pdet) showed no significant difference between the two measurements for Valsalva manoeuvres (p=0.91), at initial resting pressure (p=0.07), at 50\u00b110ml resting pressure (p=0.10), at voiding at maximum flow (Qmax; p=0.50). Bland-Altman plots indicated that paired-differences of a given patient during Valsalva manoeuvres was of 6 cmH2O maximum difference. However, it could reach up to 10 cmH2O for Pabd during Valsalva manoeuvres; and up to 14 cmH2O and 19 cmH2O for Pabd and Pves respectively, during cough movements(Fig. 2). Other paired data also showed a large variety of differences between the two systems.Interpretation of resultsThe linear correlation plots showed high correlations between pressures measured by ACC and WFC during Valsalva manoeuvres and cough movements. A stronger correlation was observed at Valsalva manoeuvres than that at cough movements, R 2 =0.985 vs 0.965 at Pves. The cough test showed a damping response over the Pves and Pabd, especially for Pves. This finding correlates with previous bench test results from Cooper et al 2 . This shows that when performing high frequency (fast) movements the ACC would appear to be overdamped, showing a slightly delayed and diminished response in the UDS tracing when compared to the real time of the event. When the results from paired-t test were considered, no statistical significant difference was found for Valsalva manoeuvres (p=0.944, p=0.701, p=0.901 for Pves, Pabd and Pdet respectively) between the two measurements. In contrast, only Pabd showed no statistical significant difference (p=0.376) between the two measurements at cough movements. When Bland-Altman plots were analysed, a large variety of differences for any given patient was observed between the two systems. This coincides with previous studies where the readings between ACC and WFC were not directly interchangeable 3 . However, the maximum 6 cmH2O difference at Valsalva manoeuvres for Pves seems to be more acceptable in clinical practice.Concluding message ACC and WFC may be interchangeable for some UDS parameters like Pves during Valsalva manoeuvres, but not for fast changing pressures signals like cough. This should be considered when using ACC on a patient population that requires pressure measurements identical to WFC. Further studies are needed to compare pressure measurements and diagnostics with both systems for different patient's populations.Fig.2 -Bland-Altman plots for repeated measurements per subject at Valsalva manoeuvres and cough movements. a.",

The PROSPERO registration number is: CRD42016039480.Clinical trials without language discrimination were included. BPS patients over 18 y/o that were treated with BTX-A were included. Studies were searched in published databases and no published literature from inception to the present day. Risk of bias analysis was done using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.Results 88 articles were found with the designed search strategies. After exclusions, four studies were included in the qualitative analyses. Kasyan et al 2012 compared BTX-A with hydrodistention. Manning et al 2014 compared the injection of BTX-A with the injection of normal saline in previously hydrodistended bladders. In both cases, primary end point was measured by the O'Leary-Sant questionnaire score (OLS). El-Bahnasy et al 2009 compared BTX-A with BCG administration, through Global Response Assessment. Kuo et al 2015 compared hydrodistention plus suburothelial injections of BTX-A with hydrodistension plus normal saline injections. Reduction in pain was measured trough VAS bladder pain score.Interpretation of resultsA similar efficacy to their controls had been found in Kasyan and Manning studies. El-Bahnasy had found improvement in BTX-A in all parameters. Kuo el al. 2015, found a significantly reduction in pain in the BTX-A group. Regarding the risk of bias, trhee studies did not have adequate descriptions of selection, performance, and detection bias. The study of Manning had low risk of selection, attrition, and reporting bias.",

MODE OF VAGINAL DELIVERY AND REPERCUSSIONS ON THE PELVIC FLOOR.Hypothesis / aims of study To evaluate the prevalence of obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASI) at our center and to assess the functional and anatomical repercussions of OASI on the pelvic floor Study design, materials and methods This was a retrospective study where we evaluated all the third-and fourth-degree perineal tears during 2016 at our tertiary university hospital. The data collected included epidemiological data, mode of vaginal delivery, degree of the tear and the type of episiotomy if performed. Postpartum follow-up was carried out by a multidisciplinary Pelvic Floor Unit where associated symptoms and the presence of avulsion by both physical examination and ultrasound were recordedResultsA total of 4426 deliveries were attended during 2016 at our hospital, of which 3974 were vaginal deliveries. Obstetric anal sphincter injury occurred in 1.93% (n=77) of the deliveries. Sixty nine were third-degree perineal tears (89.6%) and 8 were fourth-degree perineal tears (10.4%). Of these, 64.9% were instrumental deliveries using forceps (10.3% of the forceps deliveries in 2016 had an OASI) and the remaining 35.1% were normal vaginal deliveries (0.78% of the normal vaginal deliveries in 2016 had an OASI).",

This may be explained by previous treatment experience leading to reduced expectations or simply that any improvement in bladder symptoms may have greater significance to this group. Frequent pad use was viewed as unacceptable by all patients, regardless of their reported impact on quality of life. In other studies, likelihood of pad use was correlated with worsening quality of life Overall, frequent nocturia and stress urinary incontinence were viewed as the most unacceptable post-treatment symptoms across all groups.

This clinical condition presumably has a multifactorial aetiology and patients with CPPS often undergo multiple treatments for their complaints. Conventional treatments are not always successful and often patients even undergo radical surgery in order to alleviate pain symptoms. Over the past years several studies have reported positive results of neuromodulation in the treatment of CPPS. The aim of our study is to systematically review the literature on various types of neuromodulation techniques in pelvic pain syndromes.",

The inclusion criteria were women who had been diagnosed with IC/BPS based on ESSIC criteria and had a diagnostic work-up based on the AUA algorithm. Exclusions applied to potential participants who were unwilling or unable to attend the full course, allergy to specific components of iAluRil\u00ae, inability to complete the symptom questionnaires. Intravesical instillations were performed using pre-filled iAluRil\u00ae syringes (Juno), each containing sodium hyaluronate 800mg and sodium chondroitin sulphate 1g. iAluRil\u00ae. Instillations were supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to participants. Each participant received on an outpatient basis four weekly bladder instillations of iAluRil\u00ae for the first month, followed by fortnightly instillations in the second month and monthly in the third month for a total of seven instillations as per the Gilberti protocol. Baseline demographics, year of diagnosis, ESSIC score, cystoscopy details and past history and prior treatments were collected. At each visit and 3 months after treatment completion, a VAS pain score was performed along with validated Questionnaires (ICSI/ICPI O'Leary questionnaire, BPSS-QOL, BPSS-SS, EuroQOL/ED-5Q). Historical controls were selected from participating institutions and clinicians who had an established diagnosis of IC/BPS, baseline demographic data available and a full course of DMSO as per local protocol and for whom at least pre and post Sant O'Leary questionnaires were available.",

Despite this challenge, iAluRil\u00ae, an agent with pharmacological rationale as a GAG layer directed therapy, shows promise in the short to medium term in decreasing the key symptom of pain in IC/PBS and improved symptom and QOL scores as measured by the ED5Q. Lack of change in the overall health score may reflect the general nature of this item.Concluding message Compared with DMSO, the historical agent of choice when intravesical therapy is indicated for IC/PBS, IAluRil\u00ae, a new GAG layer/chondroitin sulphate therapy, is equally effective in the short to medium term in decreasing pain scores in women with IC/BPS and is well tolerated. It is also effective in decreasing symptoms and increasing QOL.Further research is suggested in a local context to build on this experience and into the durability of effect.Bertapelle M P 1 , Vottero M 1 , Ammirati E 1 , Spinapolice S 1 , Rapalino M L 1 1.

Department of Urology, Austin Health, MelbourneSACRAL NEUROMODULATION FOR DETRUSOR HYPERACTIVITY WITH IMPAIRED CONTRACTILITY.Hypothesis / aims of study Detrusor hyperactivity with impaired contractility (DHIC) is a challenging condition to manage. Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) is a proven treatment modality for both the individual aspects of DHIC. To date, data reporting the outcome of SNM for DHIC is lacking.Study design, materials and methods Consecutive patients undergoing SNM for DHIC were followed prospectively, from April 2013 to October 2016. Patient demographics, bladder diaries, subjective response rates, ICIQ-OAB and PGI-I scores were recorded. Success was defined as greater than 50% improvement in storage symptoms and a 50% improvement in voided volume or reduction of post-void residual volumes.Results 20 patients underwent stage 1 trial of SNM for DHIC. Median age was 68.5, IQR (54.25 -76.25). 13 (65%) patients were female. 14/20 (70%) of patients had a significant treatment response, 9/20 had a response to both elements of DHIC, 4/20 patients had a response to the detrusor overactivity (DO) alone and 1/20 had a response to the voiding component alone. 12/20 (60%) patients proceeded to insertion of an IPG. At mean follow-up of 17 months, IQR (1.5 -35), 11/12 (91.7%) of patients are still using the SNM for DHIC. Median PGI score is 2, IQR(2 -4). SNM for DHIC resulted in statistically significant improvements in voided volume (p=0.016), PVR (p=0.0296), ICIQ-OAB score (p<0.0001) and ICIQ-OAB bother score (p=0.016Interpretation of results This is the first study we know of to report the results of SNM for DHIC. SNM is associated with satisfactory success rates, treating both the detrusor hyperactivity, and impaired contractility components of this condition.Concluding message SNM is a valid treatment for patients with DHIC.Disclosures Funding: None Clinical Trial: Yes Registration Number: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) RCT: No Subjects: HUMAN Ethics Committee: Austin Health Research and Ethics Committee Helsinki: Yes Informed Consent: Yes Lloyd J 1 , Gill B 1 , Pizarro-Berdichevsky J 2 , Goldman H 1 1.

Sotero del Rio Hospital, ChileREMOVAL OF SACRAL NERVE STIMULATION DEVICES FOR MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING: WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?Hypothesis / aims of study Sacral neuromodulation (SNS) is an effective therapy. However, patients with SNS devices are cautioned not to undergo MRI of sites other than the head[1]  due to concern for generator and/or lead migration, heating, changes in the SNS device program, or damage to implanted components.[2]  Therefore, when non-head MRIs are required, devices are often removed prior to imaging. When considering the pathology that necessitated the MRI, it is not known how frequently this imaging ultimately changes non-GU management. Furthermore, it is unclear how commonly these patients resume SNS therapy, versus resorting to other strategies for bladder and bowel optimization. This study provides a descriptive analysis of SNS explantations performed for MRI and the related clinical situations.Study design, materials and methods A retrospective review of all SNS procedures in the urology department at a tertiary care center from 2009-2015 was performed and explants identified. Cases explanted for MRI were analyzed to collect demographics, clinical characteristics, and post-removal management. Descriptive statistics were calculated and presented as mean(standard deviation), median[interquartile range] or number (percentage), as appropriate.ResultsA total of 90 patients underwent SNS device removal, with 21(23%) occurring for MRI, of which all devices were implanted in 2012 or before. At explant, 20 patients (95%) were female and median age was 66 [52-72] years. Suboptimal symptom control from SNS was noted in 7(33%) of these patients preoperatively. Four patients (19%) had Multiple Sclerosis.",

A urology dataset including 3,431,366 individuals was selected from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) for the year 2006 to 2010. Their claim data were used for the study. We recruited the patients with the ICD-9 diagnostic code of 600.X (except 600.3) twice in 3 months, from the time of 2006 July to 2008 June. All patients with the diagnosis of prostate and bladder cancer were excluded. The medication of all statins, \u03b1-blockers, and 5\u03b1 reductase inhibitors were reviewed and must be prescribed by urologists at outpatient department for more than 3 months. In this research, there are two primary endpoints, AUR and TURP after taking all statins, \u03b1-blockers, and 5\u03b1 reductase inhibitors was recorded. For checking AUR, all patients who receive invasive procedures, such as transurethral surgical interventions, cystoscopic exam, urodynamic study, before AUR were excluded.

Comparisons of categorical urinary outcomes among patient features were tested with Pearson's chi-square test. Creatinine levels were compared by the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test. All analyses were performed in SAS 9.3  (The SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Figures were created in Stata 12.1 (StatCorp LP, College Station, TX).

The data shows the complexity of the sensory innervation of the urinary bladder, with three distinctly different morphological endings in two different layers of the bladder.

Unfortunately, many women opt-out of this invasive treatment, allowing incontinence symptoms to gradually worsen. This suggests the need for a means of delivering PFM stimulation in a manner that will be more readily adopted. Application of EMS proximate the perineal tissue has shown therapeutic promise when administered in a clinical setting [1] [2] , and recently our team had engineered this non-invasive treatment into a form factor suitable for patient-administered home use. In this study we assessed the usability of a novel, patient-applied surface electrode designed to deliver EMS through the perineal region. Specific elements of the assessment included: 1. Validation of intuitive self-application, anatomic fit and comfortable removal of a one-size-fits-all device. 2. Identification of preferred candidate waveforms capable of comfortably stimulating the pelvic floor muscles. 3 . Characterization of patient-to-patient variability of key EMS electrical parameters including impedance and stimulation current. 4. Formative human factors observations to inform optimization of user interface features.",

The stimulator, provided in a compact wearable form factor, contains a microcontroller that allows programming of various candidate stimulation waveforms.Left: Novel SUI electrode and stimulator use in study, Right: Pictoral representation of hwo device is worn. Eight subjects self-applied the device per textual and pictorial instructions. With the subjects fully dressed and seated in a chair, the voltage controlled treatment intensity was incremented while the subjects commented on the strength and comfort of the PFM stimulation. This was repeated with various waveforms and subjects provided comparative assessments. An adaptive approach eliminated the least effective waveforms from further consideration and allowed additional evaluation of derivatives of the more effective waveforms. At the end of the study the subjects completed a questionnaire. Throughout the study an oscilloscope and multimeter allowed direct measurement of treatment parameters including applied voltage (Vpp) and current (Irms). All waveforms were delivered at a stimulation frequency of 50 Hz and provided alternating 6 second periods of contraction and relaxation with 1 second of ramping. In total, 7 waveforms were tested, each broadly classified as one of three types: \u2022 Traditional Intravaginal -Single pulse bi-phasic square wave \u2022 Burst Mode Alternating Current (BMAC) -Repeating bi-phasic square wave profile with 30-50% duty cycle \u2022 Modulated -Repeating bi-phasic square wave with sinusoidal amplitude modulation Results \u2022 All subjects were able to apply, wear (~1 hour) and remove the device without difficulty or discomfort, even in the presence of pubic hair. \u2022 Subjects identified a modulated waveform at 2000Hz modulation frequency as delivering the most comfortable muscle contractions.

            "text": "Hypothesis / aims of study In fluid with high Reynolds number, Newton's law of resistance is important to define resistance of fluid passing in a duct. To reduce flow resistance of fluid with high verocity, vorticity can be created, such as narrow duct. Then, vorticity is key physical phenomenon for fluid dynamics when fluid passes a narrow duct like urethra. Although pressure flow study is main observative method to assess voiding mechanism in lower urinary tract, there are few studies to understand lower urinary tract (LUT) in the indications, intention to treat results varies between 50 and 60% (1). One of the reasons may be inadequate lead location, e.g. not close to the target nerve. The aims of the study are to determine the pelvic floor (PF) EMG responses upon electro-stimulation at different locations within the same foramen (e.g. S3 or S4); hypothesizing that different locations inside the foramen will lead to different EMG responses.Study design, materials and methods After ethical approval, 6 patients considered eligible for sacral neuro modulation were tested during the lead placement procedure. Patients under general anaesthesia without muscle relaxants were positioned prone. Standard PNE needles were used. In 4 patients 4 needles were introduced in the same foramen (S3 in 2 patients; S4 in 2 patients, parallel to the midline, with the needles also parallel to each other. In the other 2 patients, 3 parallel needles were placed (S3 in 2 patients; S4 in 1). X-ray was used to ensure that the needle tip was inside the foramen superposing the bone table. This would be the ideal position to finally release the tined lead. Electrostimulation was delivered on the PNE needle (square wave pulses 210 msec , 5 Hz) at increasing amplitudes (1-2-3-5-7-10V). PF-EMG activity was measured using the Multiple Array Probe (MAPLe) placed intravaginally. The MAPLe is a probe with a matrix of 24 electrodes enabling EMG measurement from different sides and layers of the PF (2) . For this study the maximal EMG response was taken from the anterior, posterior, ipsilateral (EMG response at same side as where the foramen needle was) and contralateral side, irrespective of the depth layer of the PF.",

The etiology is largely unknown, but the deficiency in glycosaminoglycan layer is regarded as a possible cause. On this assumption intravesical therapy with heparin, which is expected to restore the glycosaminoglycan layer deficiency, has been used to relieve the symptoms [1] . To date, however, there is no study comparing the efficacy of instillation therapy of heparin versus heparin plus lidocaine. In this study, we compared therapeutic outcomes and safety of instillation of these two solutions in a randomized double-blind trial.Study design, materials and methods The diagnosis of IC was based on the clinical guidelines for IC and hypersensitive bladder [2] . Patients with refractory IC were enrolled to the study after submitting written informed consent. Refractory IC was defined as persisting symptom of O'Leary and Sant's Interstitial Cystitis symptom index / problem index (OSSI/OSPI) score more than six points, respectively, and numerical rating scale for pain (NRS) more than three out of ten points despite of multiple conventional therapies such as life-style modification, hydrodistension, and oral medication. The patients were randomized to 6-week weekly intravesical instillation of heparin (Group A) or heparin plus lidocaine (Group B). The solution of heparin contained 20,000unit heparin (Yoshindo, Toyama, Japan) in 30 ml physiological saline. The cocktail of heparin plus lidocaine consisted of 20,000 unit heparin and 5ml 4%lidocaine in phosphate-buffered saline adjusted at pH 7.5. At each instillation, patients were instructed to refrain from voiding for at least 30 minutes. The solution was prepared every time immediately before instillation in a sterilized condition. ",

            "text": "Hypothesis / aims of study The pathophysiologies of nocturia are multifactorial and complex. Their etiologies remain unclear in a large number of patients. Previously, we reported that urination behavior in mice showed circadian rhythm which is regulated by clock genes and the abnormalities of clock genes might cause nocturia because of the loss of circadian bladder function (1). On the other hand, it has been reported that anxiety or post-traumatic-stress-disorder could increase nocturnal voiding (2) . Furthermore, some types of continuous acute stress such as restraint stress (RS) caused disruption of the circadian rhythm only in peripheral organs, without any effect on central nervous system in mice (3) . In the present study, to reveal effect of restraint stress on alternation of circadian bladder function, we investigated urination behaviour and expression rhythm of clock genes in the mice bladder after restraint stress.Study design, materials and methods Male C57BL/6 mice aged 8 -12 weeks were bred under 12 h light/dark conditions for 2 week. The light period started from 6 am [Zeitgeber time (ZT) 0)]. Mice were individually placed into the metabolic cages, and were subjected to RS for 2 hrs from ZT4 to ZT6 by enfolding using metal mesh sized 12cm\u00d712cm after the aesthesia of sevoflurane. RS was applied for 5 days (from RS1 to RS5) and the urination behavior for 24 hrs was continuously recorded from baseline to RS5. In control, urination behavior was recorded without any RS in metabolic cages for 6 days (baseline and from Day1 to Day5). The following parameters were measured both in control and RS mice, respectively: water intake volume (WIV), voiding frequency (VF), urine volume (UV) and urine volume/void (Uvol/v). Urination during the light period was counted as a nocturnal voiding.In the measurement of gene expression rhythm in clock genes, Period2 luciferase knock-in mice (Per2::luc) were used. Per2 is one of the clock genes, which act as a negative transcriptional factor for clock-controlled-genes. The bladder was removed from Per2::luc mice at ZT10, which is the peak time of Per2 expression. Then the bladder was placed into the dish type lumino-meter immediately. The bioluminescence of luciferin-luciferase reaction from removed bladder was measured for 3 days and Per2 expression rhythm was compared between control and RS mice. 15\u03bcM Forskolin was used in order to confirm the viability of bladder tissue at the end of measurement. Data were analysed using Mann-Whitney's U-test, and a one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni test.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of consecutive pregnancies on pelvic floor soft tissues, conducting biomechanical and histological analyses. In addition, the links between biomechanical and histological parameters were investigated.Study design, materials and methods Three groups of Swifter ewes were considered: young post-menarchal (virgins) (n=5; avg. age = 9 months), near term (n=5; term = 145 days; avg. age= 3 years) and after two prior vaginal deliveries (pregnant). For this investigation, vaginal wall (distal part), rectum (distal part), bladder, levator ani muscle and external anal sphincter were collected. Biomechanical and histological analyses were conducted on samples from the excised tissues. The biomechanical properties were estimated through uniaxial tests. The biomechanical properties of the tissues (Young's moduli at comfort and stress zones, inflection point and Strain at Ultimate stress) were obtained from the stress-strain curve. For histological analysis, samples were stained with Miller's Elastica to allow identification and quantification of collagen, elastin, and smooth muscle content distributions. The fraction area of each constituent was measured using ImageJ software [1] . Statistical analysis was performed to study possible variations (on mechanical properties and content distributions) of pelvic floor organs between groups. Using GPower software, the statistical power analysis (to compute required sample size) showed that at least 16 samples for mechanical and 6 for structural analysis were needed to achieve 90% power when alpha error was set to 0.05. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests showed the data follows a normal distribution, unpaired Student`s t-test was used for intergroup comparisons. The level of significance was set to p<0.05.",

Decreases in muscle tone and strength are associated with either reduced contractile activity and/or passive stiffness, which are components of the mechanism related to pelvic organs descent and urinary incontinence (UI). PFM function is commonly assessed by digital palpation scales, with the disadvantage of being a subjective method with limited reproducibility. Transperineal ultrasound (TPUS) has been increasingly used as an objective and non-invasive method to assess both the constriction of the PFM muscle and the inward movement of the pelvic floor structure, however its relation to digital assessments of PFM function in UI women is still unclear. The aim of this study is to explore the relation between PFM digital assessment (flexibility and strength) and morphometric parameters measured by TPUS in women with UI.",

There is scant research and knowledge on how to prevent and reduce DRA in postpartum women, and recent studies have emphasised urgent need for more studies on the relationship between the PFM and DRA (2) . The aim of the present study was to investigate how the PFM contraction influence inter-rectus distance (IRD) in postpartum women presenting with a DRA.Study design, materials and methods This is a cross sectional experimental study aiming to identify the acute influence of a PFM and a TrA contraction on the IRD. Parous women, 0-6 months postpartum (n=38), presenting with a DRA of two fingerwidths or more were included. A power calculation was performed based on a significance level of 0,05 and power of 0,80 resulting in a sample size of 38 parous women.The participants completed a short questionnaire on background information, symptoms of urinary incontinence (International Consultation on Incontinence Urinary Incontinence Short Form questionnaire), and symptoms of back pain (Modified Oswestry Disability Index) and pelvic girdle pain (Pelvic girdle pain questionnaire) in the postpartum period. All measurements were done in supine position with knees bent, feet resting on the plinth, and arms resting alongside the body. The IRD was measured at two different locations; 2 cm above and 2 cm below the umbilicus, using two-dimensional ultrasound imaging. The images of the IRD were collected at rest, during a pelvic floor contraction, during a transversus abdominis contraction, and during a combined contraction of the pelvic floor and transversus muscle. A correct performance of PFM and TrA contraction was confirmed by palpation and ultrasonography prior to the actual data collection. The IRD was measured using the ultrasonography's integrated measurement tool, and presented in mm.Background variables are shown as means with standard deviations (SD) and range, or numbers and percentages. The IRD data were found with normal distribution using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and inspecting Q-Q plots. A paired t-test with a 95% CI was used to examine the hypothesis of no difference between IRD at rest and during each contraction, and during PFM and TrA contractions combined (table 2) .

Elastic properties of pelvic floor muscles may be related with the risk of pelvic floor disorders but there was no non invasive technique described in the literature to measure these properties in vivo (1, 2) . The aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of in vivo assessment of elastic properties of levator ani muscle using shear wave elastography in women in various conditions. Study design, materials and methods Non-pregnant women were evaluated in lithotomy position using shear wave elastography technology with an Aixplorer device \u00ae (Supersonic Imagine). The proximal part of levator ani muscle (pubic insertion) was identified in 2D classical ultrasound mode using a translabial linear 8MHz probe (3) . A region of interest containing the levator ani muscle was identified, corresponding to the region in which shear wave elastography analysis were performed. In this region of interest, the contours of the levator ani muscle were drawn in order to perform an exclusive assessment of levator ani muscle and not the adjacent tissues ( Figure 1 ).Measurements of the shear modulus were performed at rest and Valsalva maneuver for both right and left sides. We obtained a Young's modulus measure (representing the relationship between stress and strain in a material) in kPa, which was to be divided by 3 to calculate the shear modulus (in kPa), more appropriate for anisotropic tissues such as muscles. Greater is the shear modulus, stiffer is the tissue. We recorded dynamic continuous acquisition from rest to maximal Valsalva. The highest shear modulus value during the acquisition was considered for the analysis.We reported the number of complete successful assessments, mean shear modulus values and a comparison of shear modulus during each times of the acquisition (Wilcoxon test).
