Consequently, the incidence of PJP is higher in non-HIV patients than in HIV patients, because of the increased use of immunosuppressive therapies for widespread indications [2] . So far, there is little evidence for veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment in cases of PJP-induced severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Particularly, there is no study reporting and comparing the outcome of PJP requiring ECMO therapy in HIV and non-HIV patients.",
