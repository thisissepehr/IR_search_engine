Although MAYV emergence is a potential threat, there are no specific therapies or licensed vaccine. In this study, we developed a murine model of MAYV infection that emulates many of the most relevant clinical features of the infection in humans and tested a live-attenuated MAYV vaccine candidate (MAYV/IRES). Intraplantar inoculation of a WT strain of MAYV into immunocompetent mice induced persistent hypernociception, transient viral replication in target organs, systemic production of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and specific humoral IgM and IgG responses. Inoculation of MAYV/IRES in BALB/c mice induced strong specific cellular and humoral responses. Moreover, MAYV/ iReS vaccination of immunocompetent and interferon receptor-defective mice resulted in protection from disease induced by the virulent wt MAYV strain. Thus, this study describes a novel model of MAYV infection in immunocompetent mice and highlights the potential role of a live-attenuated MAYV vaccine candidate in host's protection from disease induced by a virulent MAYV strain.",

It has been demonstrated that MAYV can also be transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes 17, 18 . Since many people work or live in forested areas and due to the ability of MAYV to be transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, higher number of Mayaro fever (MF) cases could occur in the coming years. For example, there are rising concerns about a broader circulation of this virus to other countries of Central America and Caribe. For example, MAYV was identified in 2010 as the etiologic agent of a febrile illness with arthralgic manifestations that occurred in 77 individuals, in which 19 cases were confirmed as seropositive 19 . Another study conducted by Terzian and colleagues (2015) reported the complete genome sequence of a MAYV isolated from a symptomatic patient in Acre/Brazil 20 . Authors have shown that MAYV belongs to the genotype D which is very close to the Bolivian strains 20 . Finally, a MAYV case in Haiti 19 was particularly important because this country is a central route of entrance of this arbovirus in the southern regions of the USA, as previously observed for chikungunya and zika virus 21 .",

The incubation phase lasts for 7 to 12 days, followed by onset of high fever, frontal headache, arthralgia, arthritis, myalgia, articular edema (mainly in wrist, knees and ankles), retro-orbital pain, malaise, skin rash, vomiting, diarrhea among others. Arthralgia and arthritis are common hallmarks of MF, which is painful and very debilitating, sometimes lasting for weeks-to-years after the clearance of infection 22 . The similarity of the clinical presentation of MF with other arboviral diseases, such as dengue, along with the absence of good diagnostic kits in areas of co-circulation of multiple arboviruses suggest that the precise number of cases is probably underestimated and the incidence of MAYV infection could be much higher 10, 13, 22 , e.g., it has been suggested that about 41.5% of riverside inhabitants have antibodies against MAYV 23 . Another study estimated that about 1% of all dengue-like diseases in northern Latin America could be due to MAYV infections 24 . The previous studies suggest that circulation of MAYV is probably broader and the number of cases higher than currently reported. Nevertheless, there is no approved vaccine or specific treatment for MF and the development of a vaccine is essential to prevent future outbreaks of this potentially important human disease.",

At days 14 and 21, both MPO and NAG levels, returned to baseline values (Fig. 1k,l) . Finally, histopathological analysis revealed that MAYV infection induced a time-dependent inflammatory reaction in the hind paws of mice. From days 1 to 3 post-infection, a discrete PMN infiltrate was observed diffusely within muscle fibers beneath the skin. The number of cells peaked at day 7, when neutrophils partially replaced muscle layer inducing loss of muscle architecture. Superficial bone resorption or synovial alterations in joints were not prominent. The inflammatory scenario declined from day 7 on, when mononuclear cells were seen more frequently. Tissues returned to basal conditions on day 21-post infection (Fig. 1m) . No evident histopathological alterations were detected in knee joint samples (Fig. S1 ).

There is no specific treatment or available vaccine to treat MAYV infection. Here, we investigated the effects of the live-attenuated MAYV/IRES vaccine 25, 26 further by using the immunocompetent mouse model described above. Results showed that while mice infected with the wt MAYV strain presented elevated hypernociception from day 1 until day 21 of virus inoculation (Figs. 1b and 3a), the intensity and duration of hypernociception was significantly reduced in the MAYV/IRES-inoculated group (Fig. 3a) . By day 14, nociceptive levels in MAYV/IRES mice returned to levels similar to those observed in MOCK-controls (Fig. 3a) . Interestingly, an acute increase in circulating neutrophils and lymphocytes (days 1 and 3) was found in MAYV/IRES mice, in comparison to wt MAYV infected controls. At days 7 and 14, values were significantly reduced in comparison to wt MAYV littermates (Fig. 3b ). Of note, by day 21, all leukocytes subtypes returned to baseline values similar to those found in MOCK controls (Fig. 3b) . As expected, the recovery www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ of infectious virus was greatly less in MAYV/IRES-infected mice, as shown in the paw (Fig. 3c) , popliteal lymph node (LNP) (Fig. 3d) , quadriceps muscle (Fig. 3e) , spleen (Fig. 3f) and serum (Fig. 3g ) in comparison to the wt MAYV strain. Specific anti-MAYV IgM and IgG responses were greater in the MAYV/IRES group than in wt MAYV-infected littermates. Figure 3h shows there was a 2-fold greater increase in IgM levels in the MAYV/ IRES group, at day 7 after virus inoculation, when compared to WT virus. Similarly, IgG levels were massively augmented at days 7 and 14 post-MAYV/IRES inoculation (Fig. 3i) . However, after day 21, IgG levels were equally elevated in both infected groups in comparison to MOCK controls (Fig. 3i) .",

Once we demonstrated that MAYV/IRES inoculation to BALB/c mice resulted in long-lasting cellular and humoral responses, we decided to evaluate if vaccination of BALB/c could eliminate or minimize MAYV-induced disease. For that, 6-week-old BALB/c mice were inoculated with 2 \u00d7 10 5 PFU/50 \u03bcL of MAYV/IRES attenuated virus via the s.c. intraplantar (ipl) route and 28 days later, when virus was cleared, and elevated neutralizing IgG levels were detected in serum ( Fig. 3i and Sup. Table 1 ), they were challenged with the wt MAYV strain at same inoculum www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ (2 \u00d7 10 5 PFU/50 \u03bcL ipl). Analyses were performed three days after wt MAYV virus inoculation. The experimental design is shown in Fig. 5a . Results showed that vaccination prevented the occurrence of most clinical outcomes associated with MAYV disease (Fig. 5) . Specifically, while wt MAYV inoculation to na\u00efve mice induced articular hypernociception, MAYV/IRES vaccinated mice were completed protected (Fig. 5b) . As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, MAYV/IRES administration to na\u00efve mice induced a mild increase in articular hypernociception as compared to wt MAYV. As a control for this experiment, the dashed line in Fig. 5 represents na\u00efve mice that only received MAYV/IRES and were analyzed 3 days later. Figure 5c shows that MAYV/IRES vaccination elicited increased cellular responses, characterized by elevation of neutrophils and lymphocytes in the bloodstream. Accordingly, reduced MPO (Fig. 5d ) and increased NAG (Fig. 5e ) levels on the inoculated hind paw were detected on vaccinated group as compared to wt MAYV-infected na\u00efve mice.",

MAYV/IRES vaccinated mice also showed higher activation of splenic macrophages (Fig. 7e-g) , as indicated by the higher expression of CD86 and TNF-\u03b1 in comparison to wt MAYV vaccinated mice. Greater activation of T lymphocytes was also detected following MAYV/IRES immunization (Fig. 7h-l) . Splenic CD8 + lymphocytes showed increased expression of the activation marker CD44 in MAYV/IRES versus wt MAYV vaccinated mice (Fig. 7h-i) . Indeed, compared with wt MAYV vaccinated mice, MAYV/IRES induced IL-17A-producing T CD4 + lymphocytes in the spleen, with no change in the frequency of CD25 + Foxp3 + Treg cells (Fig. 7k,l) . Taken together, our results show that vaccination of immunocompetent mice with the live attenuated MAYV/IRES virus was safe and induced full protection against a virulent WT-MAYV strain challenge. 28 . A129 \u2212/\u2212 mice lack functional type I interferon receptors and are therefore very susceptible to severe alphavirus infections 29 .

In contrast, the MAYV/IRES-infected group exhibited transitory body weight loss and 100% of survival (Fig. 7f,g) . These results clearly suggest that low inocula of MAYV/IRES are safe in mice that are immunodeficient. Further experiments evaluated the inflammatory response and viral loads after vaccine and the WT virus inoculation in A129 \u2212/\u2212 mice. The intermediate inoculum of 2 \u00d7 10 3 PFU was used and analysis were performed at day 4 after infection, before the death of A129 \u2212/\u2212 mice infected with the WT strain. Figure 8h -k shows that inoculation of 2 \u00d7 10 3 PFU of wt MAYV in A129 \u2212/\u2212 induced increased total and differential leucocyte counts, especially of neutrophils and lymphocytes in blood (Fig. 8h) , recovery of elevated viral loads in several organs such as paw, popliteal lymph node, muscle, spleen, liver, brain and serum (Fig. 8i) , massive hind paw swelling (Fig. 8j) and acute liver injury assessed indirectly by elevated ALT transaminase levels in serum (Fig. 8k) . Therefore, inoculation of the same virus inoculum of the MAYV/IRES vaccine strain was associated with lower viral loads in tissues, decreased inflammation and systemic markers of disease (Fig. 8h-k) . route and 28 days later mice were challenged with 2 \u00d7 10 5 PFU/50 \u03bcL of wt MAYV at the same hind paw.

Next experiments evaluated whether the vaccine would induce antibodies and protective immunity in A129 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Anti-MAYV humoral immune responses were evaluated at days 7 and 14 after MAYV/IRES inoculation. As seen in Fig. 8d , all mice infected with the control strain were dead by day 5. Figure 8l shows elevated levels of anti-MAYV-specific IgM on days 7 and 14 after MAYV/IRES inoculation in comparison to na\u00efve mice. A slight elevation of anti-MAYV IgG levels was observed on day 7 followed by a 10 times increase of titers at day 14 (Fig. 8l) . Once the MAYV/IRES vaccine induced anti-MAYV specific antibodies, we challenged MAYV/IRES survivors with a lethal inoculum of wt MAYV strain (2 \u00d7 10 3 PFU). Vaccinated mice were fully protected against the lethal challenge ( Fig. 8m-o) . We observed absence of hind paw edema (Fig. 8m) , body weight loss (Fig. 8n) or mortality (Fig. 8o ) upon wt MAYV inoculation in vaccinated mice.",

            "text": "MAYV is a neglected arboviral disease. There is a potential risk that MAYV may follow CHIKV to cause large urban epidemics [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] , especially since new lineages may arise through recombination 21 . This possibility underscores the need for new ways of preventing or treating MAYV infection, including the need for an approved vaccine. Knowledge about MAYV-induced immunopathology frequently derives from studies with other alphaviruses 22 . In the present study, we described a novel model of MAYV infection in adult immunocompetent mice, The age of animals in murine models of alphavirus infections has been considered a determinant factor in the susceptibility and severity of the disease. Neonates and young mice are more susceptible to infection and have been used to emulate alphaviral diseases [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . Of note, Figueiredo and colleagues (2019) 41 have shown that MAYV replication, restriction and induction of muscular inflammation are dependent on age, type-I Interferon response, and adaptive immunity. Indeed, MAYV infection of young (25-21-day-old) SV129 and BALB/c mice successfully caused arthritis and myositis, common hallmarks of MF 40, 41 . As for other arboviruses, such as Zika and Dengue 42, 43 , resistance of adult mice to alphavirus infection is especially due to innate immune components such as type I interferons, which quickly provide an antiviral state of non-infected cells 28, 29, 41 . Accordingly, infection of type I interferon receptor-deficient mice (A129 \u2212/\u2212 ) with CHIKV 29 , as well as infection of adult A129 \u2212/\u2212 or recombination activation gene-1 deficient mice (RAG \u2212/\u2212 ) with MAYV 26,41 provides a model that reproduces many of the clinical manifestations of human MF disease. Recently, MAYV infection of 3-4-week-old mice resulted in non-lethal models that emulated several clinical signs of MF in immunocompetent young-adult mice, such as footpad swelling, viremia and hepatic injury, although the arthritogenic effects of the virus were not investigated 26, 44 . Adding to previous studies, in the present work MAYV infection of 5-6-week-old immunocompetent BALB/c mice caused arthritis and hypernociception, major manifestations of the disease in humans. Although infection of immunocompetent mice with MAYV did not reproduce symptoms to the same extent as in type I interferon receptor-deficient mice, it did induce most symptoms in the setting of a functional immune system, suggesting it may be a useful model for understanding the immunological response against MAYV. Indeed, using this model, we have demonstrated that the inoculation of a live-attenuated MAYV vaccine candidate (MAYV/ IRES) in young BALB/c mice induced stronger cellular and specific humoral responses and protected from the clinical and laboratory changes induced by the WT infection.",

Pain is one of the classical signs of the inflammatory process in which sensitization of the nociceptors is the common denominator 46 . The sensitization of primary afferent nociceptors leads to a state of hyperalgesia and/ or allodynia, in humans, better described as hypernociception in animal models 47 . Articular hypernociception is usually indirectly evaluated in mice by mechanical and thermal tests 48 . Using these methods, we have shown significant hypernociception in response to mechanical stimulation upon Dengue virus infection 49 . Accordingly, we and others 50 have demonstrated that infection of mice with wild type strains of MAYV induces increased mechanical hypernociception up to 21 days of virus inoculation. Interestingly, MAYV-IRES vaccination of mice was able to prevent the hypernociception induced by WT MAYV challenge.",

These clinical findings show that the acute disease may progress to chronic erosive arthritis 51, 52 . Accordingly, we have demonstrated that MAYV infection also induces histopathological alterations in the ankle joints of mice, as characterized by loss of muscle and bone architecture. Tissues returned to basal conditions on day 21-post infection when hypernociception was not more evident. However, no evident histopathological alterations were detected in distal articulations such as knee joint, probably due to the age of mice and presence of active immune system in these mice, as compared to the other models in literature.",

The live-attenuated MAYV/IRES strain did not replicate to comparable titers as the WT strain in adult BALB/c and A129 \u2212/\u2212 mice; however, the vaccine candidate elicited a robust and specific antibody responses, similar to that observed with the wt MAYV strain. The vaccine analyzed in this work showed to confer protection against MAYV challenge and to be safe in an adult immunocompetent model. When compared to the WT, the MAYV/IRES strain induced lower levels of all the cytokines and chemokines analyzed showing lower inflammatory potential. Ex vivo analysis with splenocytes confirmed the ability of the MAYV/IRES vaccine to induce strong and long lasting cellular and humoral responses against wt MAYV strain. Accordingly, vaccinated mice challenged with wt MAYV showed reduced hypernociception, lower viral loads and decreased inflammatory markers in comparison to challenged non-vaccinated animals. MAYV/IRES vaccination also elicited augmented cellular responses, characterized by elevation of neutrophils and lymphocytes in the bloodstream. There was reduced level of MPO and increased NAG levels on the inoculated hind paw of vaccinated group as compared to wt MAYV-infected na\u00efve mice. Plaque assay revealed a massive reduction of infectious virus recovery from the hind paw and a complete prevention of virus spread to the PLN, quadriceps muscle, spleen and Scientific RepoRtS | (2020) 10:5306 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-62084-x www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ serum. Indeed, histopathological analysis from the hind paw of MAYV/IRES-vaccinated mice revealed maintenance of tissue architecture, in contrast to the disruption caused by WT-MAYV injection. Finally, vaccinated mice showed lower levels of the cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, as well as, the chemokines, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5. As these molecules are associated to monocytes response and to alphavirus normal response 37, 38, [57] [58] [59] , our data indicate lower level of monocyte activation by the vaccinal strain as compared to the WT virus. This is important for a vaccine for MAYV since activation of monocytes may contribute to the pathogenesis of MAYV-induced arthritis 53, [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] . Finally, flow cytometric analyses of spleen leukocytes showed more robust immune response in MAYV/IRES immunized mice when compared to the WT strain. Immunization with MAYV/IRES induced splenic DC accumulation and activation, accompanied by a greater activation of splenic macrophages. MAYV/IRES also augmented T CD8 + immune response, as indicated by the higher frequency of cells TCD8 + cells expressing CD44. Indeed, we observed higher production of IL-17 by CD4 + Th17 cells in the spleens of in MAYV/IRES vaccinated mice. Taken together, our results show that vaccination of immunocompetent mice with the live attenuated MAYV/IRES virus was safe and induced fully protection against a virulent WT MAYV strain challenge.",

Although this strain is attenuated, MAYV/IRES still replicates in host cells and A129 \u2212/\u2212 are deficient in important innate immune components, more specifically the type I interferons \u03b1/\u03b2 receptor. These molecules (IFN-\u03b1 and \u03b2) play a significant role in preventing viral replication and protecting the host against arboviral infections 42, 43, [64] [65] [66] . Meanwhile, they are considered the gold standard models to evaluate virus replication and therapeutical strategies (drugs or vaccines) due their elevated susceptibility to infection. Those data are in accordance with a previous studies by Weise et al. 25 , and Webb et al. 26 . The vaccine proved to be safe, inducing good immunological responses with low viral loads and no local swelling. Since it seems only a matter of time for a large outbreak of MF to arise in Brazil, the development of a vaccine is crucial. Our data allow us to deduce that the vaccine candidate studied elicits good immunological response in the BALB/c model. The development of this vaccine must continue including testing additional animal models with a close attention to immune memory.",

After incubation, the medium on each well was discarded and confluent cell monolayers were inoculated with 50 \u03bcL of the immunocomplex mixture. Then, the plate was incubated for another hour with 5% CO 2 at 37 \u00b0C. After that, the virus-serum inoculum was discarded, and the cell monolayers were overlaid with 1 mL of 2% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) diluted in MEM supplemented with 1% heat-inactivated FBS and antibiotics. Plates were then incubated for 4 days in 5% CO 2 at 37 \u00b0C. CMC medium was discarded by inversion and cells were fixed in 0.2% formalin for 1 h at rt.

We also quantified the levels of inflammatory mediators after the inoculation of the attenuated MAYV/IRES vaccine. In general, MAYV/IRES inoculation induced milder inflammatory response in comparison to wt MAYV (Fig. 4a-l). More specifically, IL-1\u03b2 levels were reduced at day 3 post-MAYV/IRES inoculation and augmented at day 5(Fig. 4a). IL-6 (Fig. 4b), VEGF(Fig. 4e), IL-17(Fig. 4f)and IL-10 (Fig. 4g)was reduced only at day 1 post-MAYV/IRES inoculation compared to WT MAYV strain while IFN-\u03b3(Fig. 4c)and TNF-\u03b1(Fig. 4d)were diminished at days 1 and 3 post-MAYV/ IRES inoculation. Finally, no differences were found between infected groups on CXCL-1 levels(Fig. 4h); however, CCL2(Fig. 4i), CCL3 (Fig. 4j), CCL4 (Fig. 4k) and CCL5 (Fig. 4l)were reduced from day 1 to day 7 in the MAYV/IRES-inoculated group. Therefore, our results demonstrate that, in addition to the increased cellular and humoral responses observed on the live attenuated MAYV/IRES vaccine group, there was an important reduction in levels of systemic inflammatory mediators, suggesting the generation of a more controlled and effective immune response.",
