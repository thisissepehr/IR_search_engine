However, in the past 12 years little progress has been made to understand the mechanisms for these observations. Data from the NIAID/NICHD multicenter Women and Infants Transmission Study (WITS) demonstrated that a decline in weight occurred in the first four months of life followed by decreased linear growth (Rich et al. 1993 ). In older children weight and height seem to decline in parallel (McKinney et al. 1993 ), but loss of lean body mass may occur prior to a decline in weight (Miller et al. 1993 ). Adequate caloric intake can im prove weight gain, but has little effect on height veloc ity and lean body mass (Henderson et al. 1994 , Miller et al. 1992 ). Long-term survivors with HIV infection are shorter than anticipated, and these changes cannot be explained solely by inadequate nutrition or by endo crine abnormalities. The immune system, gastrointes tinal tract function, malnutrition, and chronic or recur rent infection interact and contribute to the nutritional deficiencies and problems with growth observed in the HIV-infected child.

Al though some children may become infected with HIV in utero, the majority seem to acquire the infection perinatally. The route of infection is not known, but the skin, mucous membranes, and gastrointestinal tract are good candidates for tissue across which HIV can migrate. Although the gastrointestinal tract is the largest immunologie tissue, little is known about infec tion of mucosal lymphoid elements by HIV in the neo nate. However, one can speculate that virus crosses the epithelium and enters the lamina propria where HIV infects lymphocytes or is taken up by macrophages. These HFV-associated cells then migrate to mesenteric lymph nodes which become a reservoir for virus in an analogous manner to that described in the peripheral lymph nodes (Fox and Cottier-Fox 1992) .",

These immuno logie events may contribute to the development of bac terial overgrowth in the proximal small intestine and the absorption of bacterial products (e.g., endotoxin) which can activate the mucosal immune system and potentially enhance viral replication. The effects of these events on epithelial cell function are not known, but we and others have observed that HlV-infected chil dren develop lactose intolerance earlier than predicted based on race or age (Miller et al. 1991) . The mecha nism for this clinical observation is not known, but laclase and sucrase specific activities and expression of lactase mRNA should identify the pathogenesis of alterations in lactase biosynthesis. The impact of these changes of intestinal function on body composition is not known, but, early in life, HIV-infected children be gin to increase fat mass at the expense of lean body mass.",

Protein energy malnutrition without HIV infection can result in im munologie abnormalities including decreased T-cell number, diminished CD4 number, impaired delayed hypersensitivity, elevated serum immunoglobulin lev els, and impaired specific antibody responses (Beisel 1996) . When these same abnormalities are found in HIV-infected children, one cannot determine if they are related to HIV infection or to malnutrition.

Increased nutrient losses are most commonly caused by opportunistic infections, but lactose intolerance, pancreatic insufficiency, or small intestinal injury can contribute to malabsorption. Increased nutrient requirements are most fre quently associated with febrile illnesses, but metabolic abnormalities such as futile cycling and abnormal hor mone or cytokine production can alter intermediate metabolism and modify nutrient requirements.
