To select flavivirus na\u00efve macaques, baseline IgG serostatus was determined using a multiplex Luminex kit (Ampersand Biosciences Flavivirus Serological Panel). Briefly, macaque serum was diluted 1:2,000 in sample diluent and added to multiplexed magnetic beads coupled with Zika, Dengue, Yellow Fever, Japanese Encephalitis, West Nile, Usutu, Saint Louis Encephalitis, and Chikungunya virus antigens. Serum and beads were incubated on a plate shaker for 1 hour at room temperature and then washed three times with assay buffer. Detection antibody, anti-IgG PE, was added to each sample and incubated on a plate shaker for 30 minutes at room temperature. Following another three wash cycles, beads were resuspended in assay buffer and read on the Bio-Plex MAGPIX to measure median fluorescent intensity (MFI) for each bead set.
