However, high death losses resulting from diarrhea in artificially reared piglets have dampered enthusiasm for early weaning. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, transmissible gastroenteritis virus and rotavirus are the three main enteropathogens responsible for causing the diarrhea. The enteropathogens infect the small intestine, which produces a secretory or malabsorptive diarrhea. In nature, the nursing piglet is protected from the enteropathogens by antibody bathing his gut. The source of the antibody is the dam's colostrum and milk. It should be possible to protect artificially reared, early weaned piglets from enteropathogens by feeding them diets that contain antibodies to putative enteropathogens. (",

Artificial rearing of piglets for the purposes of increasing sow efficiency has been an attractive concept for years (Lecce, 1975) . The major drawback to rearing pigs artificially has been the high death losses associated with artificially reared, early weaned piglets. Diarrhea, the nemesis of 1 Presented at the Nonruminant Nutrition Syrup. entitled \"Increasing Sow Efficiency\" at the 77th Annu. Meet. of the Amer. Soc. of Anita.

Accepted April 18, 1986. the early weaned piglet, accounts for most of the losses, and it seems that the earlier a pig is weaned, the more difficult it is to rear (Bellis, 1957) . This may be so because the younger the piglet is, the more susceptible his enterocytes in the small intestine are to enteropathogens (Kohler, 1972; Moon et al., 1975; Kirstein et al., 1985) . Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGE) and rotavirus are the main etiological agents that cause piglet neonatal diarrhea. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli produce a secretory diarrhea and the viruses produce a malabsorptive diarrhea. The cell that is perturbed by ETEC or destroyed by virus is the enterocyte in the small intestines. Immunoglobulin in the sow's colostrum and milk protects the nursing piglet from enteropathogens by neutralizing pathogens in the lumen of the gut.",

If the host contacts the pathogen again, then the immune system responds quickly, by expanding the pool of committed B-and T-lymphocytes and pouring out specific antibodies and T-cells. Immunity acquired in response to an antigen is called active immunity. Active immunity is long lived-sometimes as long as the natural life of the host. Immunity can also be acquired passively. In the case of humoral immunity, this can be accomplished simply by injecting immunoglobulins from an actively immunized animal into an immunologically naive animal.

LT resembles Vibrio cholera toxin in that it increases the level of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) within the intestinal mucosal cell. An increase in cAMP inhibits NaC1 and water absorption and stimulates an increase in the secretion of C[-and HCO3-by crypt cells. ST a increases the level of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which in turn blocks NaC1 absorption while CI-and HCO3-secretion is increased (Rubino and Guandalini, 1984) . The means whereby ST b affects gut ceils is not well understood (Kennedy et al., 1984) . Increased amounts of salts and water in the lumen can lead to diarrhea, dehydration and death. It is important to note that E. coli produce little damage to the mucosa (Kohler, 1972; Moon, 1974) . Except for the temporary perturbation of .salt and water absorption, enterocytes appear normal. And the mechanism for glucose driven Na+-coupled absorption of amino acids remains intact. For this reason, oral rehydration solutions using glucose and salts seem to be of therapeutic value (Bywater and Woode, 1980) . Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV). In 1946, Doyle and Hutchings discovered that a virus was capable of causing an acute, rapid, fatal, transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) in neonatal piglets. Later it was learned that TGE is caused by a corona virus. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus is an 80-to 120-nm pleomorphic, enveloped virus with knobby projections, which appear in electron micrographs like a crown or corona surrounding the viral particle. The nucleic acid in TGEV is a single strand of ribonucleic acid (RNA). Because TGEV is surrounded by a lipid membrane and fragile knobs, it is susceptible to solvents and extremes in environmental temperatures. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus replicates in the enterocytes of the piglet's small intestine, and destroys these cells. There is a massive loss of absorptive surface, producing a malabsorptive diarrhea. Figure 3 shows scanning electron micrographs of normal and blunted villi from piglet's jejunum. In the upper panel, villi are normal. In the lower panel, villi are in various stages of destruction. These piglets were infected with rotavirus, but piglets infected with TGEV have similar pathologic changes (Olson et al., 1973; . Piglets with severe lesions rapidly dehydrate and die. The disease tends to be self-limiting in that herd immunity develops as the gilts and sows become infected and they in turn become immunized and capable of protecting their . Piglets infected with TGEV have similar changes in villi (Olson et al., 1973) . (\u2022 446) progeny via colostrum and milk (Haelterman, 1972) . Furthermore, since the virus is fragile it tends to disappear from the farm. There is some evidence that oral rehydration, glucose electrolyte solutions may be of values in malabsorption diarrhea, as well as in secretory diarrhea (Bywater and Woode, 1980) .",
