Septic circulatory failure is characterized by strong vascular hyporeactivity to vasopressors such as the alpha-1 receptor agonist norepinephrine.We recently described a systemic downregulation of alpha-1-adrenergic receptors which contributes to septic circulatory failure (Bucher et al. Crit Care Med 2003; 31:566-571) Objectives: Here we investigate the role of NF-\u03baB in the pathogenesis of cecal ligation and puncture-(CLP)-induced cardiovascular failure with downregulation of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. Methods: Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in wildtype-mice and mice with deficiencies for proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, mice were injected with TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-6. Animals were treated with pyrroldine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) blocking NF-\u03baB activity. Hemodynamic parameters and expression of alpha-1 receptors were examined. Finally, hemodynamic dose-respsonse studies with norepinephrine were performed. Results: CLP treatment resulted in a hyperdynamic circulatory failure, a diminished vascular reactivity to norepinephrine and a significant downregulation of alpha-1-receptors. Proinflammatory cytokines also downregulated alpha-1-receptors and caused cardiovascular dysfunction. However, suppression of single proinflammatory cytokines in cytokine knock-out mice did not diminish CLP-induced downregulation of alpha1-receptors. In contrast, blocking of NF-\u03baB via PDTC significantly attenuated liberation of multiple cytokines and CLP-induced downregulation of alpha-1-receptors. Thereby, PDTC prevented septic cardiovascular failure and improved survival of septic mice. Conclusions: Our findings define a critical role for NF-\u03baB in the pathogenesis of septic shock as NF-\u03baB ameliorates sepsis-induced downregulation of alpha-1 receptors, indicating that targeting NF-\u03baB is a desired therapeutic strategy to treat septic vasoplegia.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 404, "end": 438, "text": "(Bucher et al.

The development of multiple-organ failure due to sepsis continues to be one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity. The occurrence of thrombozytopenia in critically ill patients has been observed for many years, and platelets play an important role in the induction of organ dysfunction. Platelets express many receptors and store a lot of influential cytokines and chemokines in their \u03b1-granules, which underly their role in inflammation. Colon ascendens stent peritonitis (CASP) is a clinical relevant animal model of polymicrobial sepsis in mice and can be used to follow the function of platelets in sepsis. To induce septic conditions in an in vitro model, cells can be stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, a component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. LPS is an important agent in the induction of systemic inflammation. It binds to the TLR4-MD2complex, which is also expressed on the surface of platelets Objectives: In recent years evidence has accumulated that platelets have many effects beyond their role in hemostasis and thrombosis. They are involved in pathways of inflammation and react themselves to exogenous noxa like LPS. The aim of our research is to examine the role of platelets in systemic inflammation and the part played by the chemokine receptor CCR4 which they express on their surface. In the first readout we looked at the development of liver dysfunction in murine sepsis. In the second approach we analyzed in vitro the changes of human CCR4-mRNA in platelets after stimulation with LPS. Methods: CASP was performed in CCR4-/-and C57Bl/6 wild type mice. 20 hours after CASP immunohistochemistry was used to assess the number of platelets in murine liver microcirculation and to determine whether the CCR4 receptor influences the recruitment of platelets during experimental sepsis. The processing of CCR4 mRNA after treatment with LPS was followed using qRT-PCR. Platelet activation was induced by LPS (E.coli O:127) directly injected in a human platelet concentrate with a final concentration of 1\u03bcg LPS per ml. After injection the concentrate was gently moved over 20 h to avoid formation of clots and unwanted activation and was stored at room tem-perature. After different time points a small amount of platelet rich plasma was taken out and RNA from 2x107 cells was isolated by using the TRIZOL-method. Results: In murine liver a significant increase of platelets is observed 20 h after CASP, in both CCR4-/-and C57Bl/6 wild type mice compared to the non-septic control group. The progression curves of real time PCR show that E. coli LPS induced the human platelet CCR4 RNA processing. The increase in spliced CCR4 RNA after LPS exposure was time dependent. Maximal accumulation of processed RNA occurred 20h after stimulation, where it was 3 times higher than without LPS. Conclusions: These findings indicate that sepsis leads to a recruitment of platelets in the microvascular system of the liver which is independent of the CCR4 receptor. Nevertheless the chemokine-receptor 4 is part of the platelet response during inflammation, because its mRNA is processed and increased by the spliceosome in platelets after LPS treatment. These findings lead to new experiments which should be done in future. If the receptor protein is really synthesized is currently checked by western blot. Also the RNA of its ligands MDC (macrophages-derived chemokines) and TARC (thymus-and activation regulated chemokine), which are stored in the \u03b1-granules of platelets will be concerned in following LPS-experiments.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction:"}, {"text": "Infection 2009; 37 (Suppl.

Objectives: Aim of the project was to study the influence of Se-supplementation on the acute phase response (APR) in male and female mice after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection, and to ascertain whether there is a sex-specific difference of the effect. Methods: We have injected male and female mice on different Se status with LPS to induce an APR. Se-levels were determined by Total reflection X-ray fluorescence analysis (TXRF) and Selenoproteins were detected by WesternBlot or Enzyme Activity Assays. A multiplex biometric immunoassay was used to determine circulating cytokine-levels. Results: Serum Se showed a very pronounced decline to approx. 50% of control values during the acute phase response. Cytokine production was strongly affected by the Se-status. The Se poor animals displayed significantly enhanced concentrations of the circulating cytokines IL-6 (2-fold, p<0,05) and MCP-1 (2-fold, p<0,01) compared to the Se-supplemented mice. Se-supply increased the glutathione peroxidase activity (pGPx) and selenoprotein P (SePP) concentration in serum. Upon LPS injection, both pGPx activity and SePP concentrations declined in both male and female mice. The effect was especially pronounced in well-supplied mice, but the final levels were still above those insufficient concentrations observed in the mice on the Se-poor diet. At the same time, the cytokine-regulated selenoprotein S (SELS) increased tissuespecifically in liver and seems to profit from the deranged Se metabolism.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "022"}, {"text": "Conclusions: Se supplementation influences selenoprotein expression and the APR in a beneficial way.

Interplay and contributions of underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood although various molecular events are discussed, including cardiosuppressive effects of proinflammatory mediators, derangement of calcium homeostasis and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Objectives: In a murine model of polymicrobial peritonitis resulting in severe sepsis we determined myocardial gene expression alterations in a set of selected genes which are implicated in inflammatory (S100a9, C5ar1) and apoptotic pathways (Fas, Tnfrsf1a, Smpd1) or have been noticeable in preliminary cardiac microarray studies of our research group (Bcr, Myc, Cth) . Histological examination was performed to evaluate apoptotic cell death of cardiomyocytes. Methods: Female C57BL/6J mice received either intraperitoneal injection of human fecal suspension (PCI = peritoneal contamination and infection) or sterile sodium chloride solution. Hearts were harvested after 6 or 24h and genes were analyzed for transcriptional changes utilizing real-time quantitative PCR. After normalization using three unvaried housekeeping genes, expression values were calculated as log2 fold changes and subjected to statistical evaluation (MWU test, Levene's test; Bonferroni-Holm adjusted p-value < 0.05). Apoptosis was determined via TUNEL staining. Results: Murine heart tissue exhibited elevated gene expression levels of death receptors Fas and Tnfrsf1a in septic animals. However, histological sections revealed no significant apoptosis in cardiomyocytes following PCI. Furthermore extensive up-regulation of S100a9, encoding a small calcium binding protein, was observed in the sepsis groups. Increased transcription of proto-oncogenes Myc and Bcr could be confirmed, while mRNA of the hydrogen sulfide generating cystathionine-\u03b3-lyase (Cth) was down-regulated. Conclusions: Low apoptotic rate of cardiomyocytes in this model is consistent with clinical studies and indicates that septic cardiomyopathy may be due to functional and molecular rather than structural alterations. Roles of proto-oncogenes and Cth in the course of cardiac dysfunction need to be further elucidated. As hydrogen sulfide is described to act anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion, down-regulation of Cth may be a crucial event for the development or aggravation of septic cardiomyopathy. Introduction: During sepsis immune cells and inflammatory mediators are released from the gastrointestinal tract into the mesenteric lymph causing severe pulmonary dysfunction (Glatzle JOGS 2007) . Basic science and clinical studies indicate a protective effect of long chain fatty acids during sepsis although the involved pathways still have to be clarified. Objectives: We investigated the effect of an enteral immune modulating diet with long chain fatty acids on distinct leukocyte release of the gastrointestinal tract during sepsis and the ability of enteral fatty acids to inhibit the activity of gut derived leukocytes released in mesenteric lymph during sepsis. Methods: Lymph fistula rats were used to collect mesenteric lymph. The animals were intestinally infused with either a 5% glucose solution (control) or a solution of 5% glucose and 2% long chain fatty acids in form of olive oil. Mesenteric lymph was collected before and after LPS (E.coli 5mg/kg i.p.) injection and immune cells were analyzed with FACS. Furthermore lymph leukocytes (\u2248106) were isolated and in vitro stimulated with LPS (10ng, 100ng, 1\u00b5g, 10\u00b5g). TNF\u03b1 concentration was determined in the supernatant of the in vitro stimulation by ELISA. Results: Interestingly the release of T-cells (approximately 70% of total cell content), macrophages and dendritic cells (approximately 7% of total cell content) from the gut during LPS-induced sepsis was not significantly different in rats treated either with glucose or long chain fatty acids. However, in vitro LPS-stimulation of mesenteric lymph leukocytes harvested from rats enterally treated with long chain fatty acids caused an up to fourfold lower release of TNF\u03b1 compared to the control group (TNF\u03b1 pg/ml, control vs. long chain fatty acids, basal: 11\u00b16 vs. 6\u00b13; 10 ng: 11\u00b17 vs. 14\u00b15; 100ng: 45\u00b119 vs. 21\u00b111; 1\u00b5g: 31\u00b112 vs. 8\u00b15*; 10\u00b5g: 33\u00b18 vs. 11\u00b15*; *p<0,05 vs. control). Conclusions: Abdominal sepsis leads to activation of leukocytes in the gut wall and subsequent release of inflammatory mediators such as TNF\u03b1. Here we report that an intestinal immune modulating diet with long chain fatty acids in form of olive oil is able to suppress TNF\u03b1 release of gut derived immune cells. It is likely that the so called cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway accounts for this effect, thereby inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines into the circulation.

Objectives: To investigate whether DAA provides effects on murine heart in sepsis. Methods: Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in male NMRI-mice (n=20, body weight 30\u00b13g). Animals were randomly assigned to vehicle infusion (control), or CLP sepsis with DAA infusion (DAA; 24\u00b5g/kg/hr). A third group received only sham operation and vehicle infusion (Sham). 48 hrs prior to CLP all mice were given a permanent central i.v.-line and an arterial transmitter (PA-C10, St. Paul, MN, USA) to measure heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP). CLP was adjusted to survive 24hrs. After 12hrs of sepsis, heart tissue was snap frozen in liquid hydrogen and plasma samples were collected and frozen following manufacturers guidelines until measurement. RNA was extracted of frozen tissue (RNeasy, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and analysed by real-time-PCR with mouse specific primers to CD14 and MIP2 normalized to \u00df-Actin (all: biomers, Ulm, Germany) using an iCycler (Biorad, Hercules, USA). Determination of Interleukin (IL)-6, IL10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) was performed using a cytometric bead array (CBA, BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany).

MAP was significantly higher in sham group (p=0.031) and non-significantly higher in DAA group when compared to control (Sham 137\u00b115mmHg; DAA 111\u00b126mmHg; Control 97\u00b14mmHg). Normalized expression ratio of CD14 was 28.7 fold higher in control group compared to sham group. DAA treatment resulted in an 18.1 fold expression ratio (p=0.001).

MODS is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in septic patients but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain widely unclear. Objectives: The present study provides an overview on alterations in protein expression of serum, brain, heart, and liver using proteomic techniques in a cecal ligature and puncture (CLP) model of rat sepsis [1] [2] [3] [4] . Methods: After approval by the local institutional review board, 62 male Wistar rats were investigated and assigned to three sham groups (n=16) and three sepsis groups (n=46). Rats of the sepsis groups and control groups were analyzed at 12, 24, and 48 hours after sepsis induction. Sepsis was induced by CLP and organs removed after decapitation. 2D-gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and mass spectrometry (MS) as well as bioinformatic network pathway analysis (Pathway Studio \u00ae , Ariadne Genomics, USA) were used to identify and interpret alterations in protein expression between septic and non-septic samples. Results: Mortality was 59 % in the CLP groups but no rat of the sham group died. In a total of 72 gels, 1,277\u00b110 protein spots per gel were discriminated with the proteomic method. 118 spots were differentially regulated (serum: n=55; brain: n=38; heart: n=12; liver: n=13) and proteins identified with MS. Using Pathway Studio, oxidative stress, cell death, and NO-biosynthesis as important cell processes were found to be associated with protein alterations. Additionally, bioinformatic analysis showed relations to inflammation, endothelial cell dysfunction, and diabetes mellitus. Conclusions: The complete array of protein alterations indicates a strong association with inflammation and endothelial cell dysfunction. Oxidative stress and severely compromised cellular function following sepsis seem to play a major role for developing MODS. Lymphocyte apoptosis in severely septic rats receiving lipid emulsions Introduction: Severe sepsis remains a leading cause of death in intensive care units. The long-term parenteral administration of lipid emulsions enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) has been shown to differentially modulate immune functions and apoptotic pathways in vivo and in vitro depending on their respective content of \u03c9-6and \u03c9-3-FA. However, the short-term effects of PUFA in the context of severe sepsis remain unclear. Objectives: The present study was designed to compare the immediate effects of a continuous perfusion with \u03c9-6-enriched soybean oil (SO) or \u03c9-3-enriched fish oil (FO) on pro-inflammatory cytokines, on lymphocyte apoptosis in the spleen and on the plasma profile of PUFA in a rodent model of severe sepsis induced by cecal ligation and incision (CLI). Methods: After governmental approval of this prospective randomized study, 34 male Sprague-Dawley rats (501\u00b133 g) received tracheotomy and mechanical ventilation. I.v. anesthesia and additional lipid perfusion were administered throughout the entire observation time of 390 min to the following six groups: 1. Laparotomy (LAP, n=4); 2. LAP + 0.06 g/kg/h Intralipid-10% (LAP-SO, n=6); 3. LAP + 0.06 g/kg/ h Omegaven-10% (LAP-FO, n=6); 4. CLI (n=6); 5. CLI-SO (n=6); 6. CLI-FO (n=6). At the end of observation time, plasma samples were analysed for their content of free FA (chromatography) and for Interleukin-(IL-)1\u03b2 and IL-6 (ELISA). Spleen lysates were analysed for cleaved caspase-3 expression (Western Blot) and splenic lymphocytes for characteristic apoptotic morphology (FACS). Statistical analysis was performed using Two-Way ANOVA with Dunn s post-hoc test. Differences were considered significant if p < 0.05. Results: Within 390 min after sepsis induction, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 plasma levels were significantly induced in the CLI-FO-group compared to CLI and to CLI-SO. Moreover, both SO and FO administration induced splenic apoptosis and cleaved caspase-3 expression regardless of the surgical procedure. The CLI-sepsis led to a loss of total free FA and to a simultaneous relative increase in arachidonic acid. Conclusions: \u03c9-6-enriched SO and \u03c9-3-enriched FO possess characteristic immunomodulating properties in this short-term model of severe sepsis, hitherto only been described after long-term administration.

Conclusions: In this animal model of peritoneal sepsis and septic shock, GEL showed comparable hemodynamic properties without significantly improved markers for renal integrity as compared to HES. \u00b5pO2 was significantly higher in GEL treated animals, eventually due to dilution effects by the higher osmolarity of HES.

Introduction: During the last decades, fungi became important opportunistic pathogens causing life threatening infections, such as invasive mycoses and sepsis. Important human pathogens are Candida albicans, the most often from blood isolated fungus and Aspergillus fumigatus, the most common airborne fungal pathogen1. Research on them is done on various cellular levels, for example on transcriptome and proteome. Mostly, data from both levels are analyzed separately, although they are very much intertwined. 1Kullberg BJ, Oude Lashof AML (2002) . Epidemiology of opportunistic invasive mycoses. Europ J Med Res, 7(5), 183-191. Objectives: It is an important goal of Bioinformatics to combine data of transcriptome and proteome and to enhance analysis and comparison between them. Data integration requires data storage. There are about 1000 databases available via the internet that are of importance for molecular biology2. None of them includes transcriptomic and proteomic data of human pathogenic fungi and we want to fill this gap. 2Galperin M Y (2009).

Introduction: Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is the major circulating steroid hormone in humans. As an intermediate in the sex steroid synthesis it can be metabolized to both testosterone and estrogen. DHEA has been reported to exhibit predominantly estrogenic effects in a male hormonal environment. Estrogens appear to exhibit immunoprotective properties following trauma, shock and sepsis. Objectives: Therefore, we studied the effects of DHEA administration upon leukocyte activation and related parameters within the microcirculation in experimental sepsis (colon ascendens stent peritonitis -CASP) using intravital microscopy (IVM) of the wall of the terminal ileum. Introduction: Activated protein C (APC) is a physiologic anticoagulant, which has additionally multiple cytoprotective effects, including anti-inflammatory activity and may support endothelial barrier function. Recombinant human APC reduces mortality in severe sepsis patients. Encephalopathy is an early clinical indicator of sepsis. However, the changes within the cerebral microcirculation that may be responsible for the organ dysfunction are not yet completely elucidated and specific therapies are not established. Objectives: The goals of the study were to evaluate leukocyte-endothelial interactions, capillary perfusion and plasma extravasation within the pial microcirculation during experimental endotoxemia in rats and to study the effects of APC in this setting by intravital microscopy (IVM). Methods: A prospective, randomized, controlled animal study was conducted with 40 male Lewis rats. The groups consisted of the animals that (A) were untreated (controls), (B) had induced colon ascendens stent peritonitis (CASP; (4) ), (C) received endotoxin bolus (5 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide, LPS, i.v.), and (D) received endotoxin bolus (5 mg/kg LPS i.v.) accompanied by APC (2 mg/kg i.v.). After 2 hours of observation, IVM through two cranial windows (5) was performed and leukocyte-endothelial interactions, functional capillary density (FCD) and plasma extravasation were determined within the pial microcirculation. Results: During CASP sepsis and endotoxemia (groups B & C), leukocyte adherence and plasma extravasation in the pial microcirculation were significantly increased. FCD was significantly reduced because of a high number of dysfunctional or non-perfused capillaries (P<0.05, versus group A). The APC treatment (group D) reduced leukocyte adherence significantly as compared to untreated LPS animals (group C). In addition, a significant increase of the FCD was found in group D compared to group C (P<0.05).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "The APC treatment reduced sepsis-associated impairment of the pial microcirculation in rats.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "Patients with compensated liver cirrhosis are often admitted to the ICU because of an acute event like gastrointestinal bleeding complicated by sepsis or multisystem organ failure.

Methods: Eight female German Landrace pigs (~60Kg) were randomly allocated to the Hepa Wash (n=4) and control (n=4) groups. Animals were admitted to the operation room (on Day 0) for the surgical induction of ischemic and cholestatic liver injury. This was performed via a functional end-to-side portosystemic anastomosis and ligation of main bile ducts. Animals were returned then to the stall for observation. On the third postoperative day (Day 3), the animals were readmitted to the operation room and prepared for the induction of endotoxemia. The lipopolysaccharide (E.Coli O111:B4) was administered intravenously (after 90 minutes stabilization period) at an initial dose of 4 \u00b5g/kg/hr with a stepwise twofold increment every hour and stopped after 7 \u00bd hours. Treatment with Hepa Wash was started 2.5 h after endotoxemia and continued till the end of the 8-hour observation period. Results: On Day 3, animals (n=8) had hyperbilirubinemia (5.8 \u00b1 0.3 mg/dl; mean \u00b1 SEM) and hyperammonemia (284\u00b1 44 \u00b5g/dl). After starting endotoxin infusion, there were signs of capillary leak, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, respiratory distress, hyperdynamic/hypodanymic circulation and renal failure. All animals in the Hepa Wash group survived the 8-hour observation period. Animals in the control group died after (6.4 \u00b1 0.4 h) though they received only one third of the total endotoxin dose on average. At the end of treatment with Hepa Wash, there were improvements of cardiovascular (e.g. mean blood pressure of 65 \u00b1 10 vs. 30 \u00b1 5 mmHg), cerebral, respiratory and renal parameters as well as the elimination of surrogate parameters as bilirubin (3.1 \u00b1 0.5 vs. 5.4 \u00b1 0.3 mg/dl) and ammonia (242 \u00b1 75 vs. 1260 \u00b1 553 \u00b5g/dl).

The susceptibility of the intestinal barrier to platelet activating factor PAF in the isolated perfused rat small bowel Introduction: Liberation of inflammatory mediators like platelet activating factor (PAF) provoke barrier dysfunction, septic shock and multiple organ failure.

We identified the dose-response relationships of PAF in the isolated rat small bowel. Methods: Small intestines were harvested from Wistar rats and perfused vascularly and luminally in a warm humidified chamber. After equilibration intestines were challenged vascularly with different doses of PAF (0.5, 5, 50, 150, 500 and 1500 pmol) . In one experiment, the PAF receptor antagonist ABT-491 was applied in parallel. Arterial, venous and luminal pressures as well as venous, luminal and lymphatic effluent flows were recorded. The transfer of FITC dextrane (150kD) from the vessels to the lumen and lymphatics was measured every 15 minutes. All parameters regarding stability and viability were recorded as described before (1). Results: PAF administration in increasing amounts from 0.5 to 1500 pmol evoked its typical transitory effects like vasoconstriction (\u0394 Pmax from 1.9 to 32 mmHg), loss of vascular fluid (from 0.8 to 27.6 ml/10min) and transfer of FITC dextrane from the vascular buffer to the luminal juice (from 1.7 to 373 \u00b5g/15min) and the lymph (from 6.4 to 191 \u00b5g/15min Introduction: One of the therapeutic essentials in septic shock is adequate volume replacement. The type of solution to be used as volume replacement remains controversial. Objectives: Using a porcine two hit model combining a haemorrhagic and septic shock we tested the effects of 6%HES 130/0.42 (HES130), Gelatine 4% (Gela) and 10%HES 200/0.5 (HES200) compared to Ringer Acetate (RAc) on inflammation and systemic haemodynamics. Methods: Prospective randomised, controlled animal study. 23 anaesthetised, ventilated pigs (28.2 \u00b1 1.7 kg) (5 in each shock group, 3 in control group). Animals were bled until reaching half of their baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP) for 45 minutes. After hemorrhagic shock volume resuscitation started until baseline MAP was accomplished. As second hit sepsis was induced using an E. Coli bacterial clot into abdominal cavity 6 h after hemorrhagic shock. Infusion rate was titrated to maintain a central venous pressure of 12 mmHg. Systemic haemodynamics and cytokines were obtained before (bl) hemorrhagic and septic shock and every 2 hours after induction of septic shock. Statistics were performed using ANOVA. Results: 12h after sepsis induction MAP (mmHg) was lower in RAc group (59\u00b15) compared to all other groups (HES200 70\u00b121;HES130: 86\u00b111;Gela: 71\u00b126;Control: 96\u00b17).

TNF-\u03b1 Levels [pg/ml] Introduction: Sepsis remains one of the major reasons for death in intensive care units in industrialized countries around the world. The pathophysiology involves a vast network of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-(TNF-), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). This is accompanied by an up regulation of transcription factors such as nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB). Objectives: Previously it has been shown that the clinically used central acting alpha2 agonist clonidine is able to significantly reduce proinflammatory cytokines in surgical patients. We therefore hypothesize that central acting alpha-2 agonists, like clonidine or dexmedetomidine, have the ability to improve survival in experimental sepsis by inhibiting the sympathetic tone and consequently inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Methods: We conducted a prospective, randomized laboratory investigation using a murine model of CLP-induced sepsis. Animals receiving pre-emptive injections were treated with either clonidine (5\u00b5g/kg) or dexmedetomidine (40\u00b5g/kg) 12 and 1 hours before the operation, as well as 1, 6 and 12 hours afterwards. Another group of animals only received clonidine (5\u00b5g/kg) 1h, 6h and 12h after the operation, while the pre-emptive injections were done with normal saline. The control groups received solvent injections at the respective time points. Results: Administering clonidine or dexmedetomidine pre-emptively significantly reduced mortality (clonidine: p=0.015; dexmedetomidine: p=0.029), while postoperative administration failed to prolong survival significantly. Moreover pre-emptive administration of clonidine significantly attenuated the cytokine response after CLP-induced sepsis (mIL-1\u03b2: p=0.017; mIL-6: p<0.0001; mTNF-\u03b1: p<0.0001), preserved blood pressure control (p=0.024) and down-regulated the binding activity of NF-\u03baB. There were no changes in the pro-inflammatory cytokine response when peripheral blood was incubated with LPS alone compared to clonidine (10-4) plus LPS incubation. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the pre-emptive administration of either clonidine or dexmedetomidine have the ability to successfully improve survival in experimental sepsis. Moreover there seems to be a connection between the central muscarinic network and the vagal cholinergic response. By down-regulating pro-inflammatory mediators sympatholytics may be a considered as a pre-emptive therapeutic option in high-risk patients undergoing major surgery. Conclusions: Our 2-D reference map of conidial proteins from A. fumigatus constitutes the first global view on the proteome of resting conidia of an Aspergillus species. Conidial germination in the lung is a key step in the establishment of invasive aspergillosis. The results of our detailed in-gel comparison of spore-, germling-and myceliumspecific protein expression will broaden our understanding of this process. We expect that our data will facilitate further comparative proteomic studies as well as immunoproteomic applications and thereby contribute to the identification of fungal allergens and virulence factors. Introduction: Thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) effectively reduces intraoperative sympathetic stimulation resulting from surgical trauma. TEA is therefore an integral part of a multimodal concept to accelerate rehabilitation after major abdominal and thoracic surgery and is increasingly incorporated into therapeutic strategies in critical care medicine.

After 6 h exhaled NO (exNO) was measured in anesthetized and tracheostomized rats. Then bradykinin (BK)-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction (= surrogate marker of endothelial dysfunction) was investigated using an established model of isolated and perfused lungs. Therefore BK was injected into the pulmonary circuit in 3 different doses (1, 3 and 6 \u00b5g). Changes in perfusion pressure (\u0394p) were measured in mmHg.

Endotoxemic rats (LPS) exhibited a distinctive rise in exNO levels (exNO 116 \u00b1 10 ppb, p < 0.05 vs. SHAM). Treatment with TEA (LPS + TEA) resulted in a significant reduction of exNO levels (69 \u00b1 12 ppb) when compared to LPS (p < 0.05) but remained elevated when compared to SHAM (p < 0.05).

Thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) has been shown to restore blunted HPV in acute pancreatitis in rats by suppressing exhaled nitric oxide (exNO) production (2). Objectives: We hypothesized that TEA improves HPV in isolated perfused rat lungs by affecting pulmonary NO production during endotoxemia. Methods: 32 Sprague -Dawley rats underwent sham laparotomy or induction of endotoxemia secondary to intraperitoneal injection of Salmonella typhosa lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Septic animals were then treated with either bupivacaine 0.5% (15 \u00b5l\u00d7h-1, LPS + TEA group) or normal saline epidurally (15 \u00b5l\u00d7h-1, LPS group) for 6 h post injury.

After 6 h anesthesia and tracheostomy was performed. ExNO from rats` lungs was measured followed by isolation and perfusion of the pulmonary circuit. Angiotensin II (= surrogate marker for vascular smooth muscle cellfunction) was injected into the circuit to test vasoreactivity. Lungs were ventilated with a hypoxic mixture (3% O2) for 10 min. and then with a normoxic mixture (21% O2) for an equal period. Changes in perfusion pressure (\u0394p) were measured in mmHg. Differences between groups were evaluated with one-way ANOVA. Results: ExNO levels did not differ between SHAM (exNO 2.1 \u00b1 0,2 ppb) and SHAM + TEA (3.2 \u00b1 0.3 ppb). Endotoxemic rats (LPS) exhibited a marked rise of exNO levels (exNO 115 \u00b1 9 ppb, p < 0.05 vs. SHAM). Treatment with TEA (LPS + TEA) resulted in a significant reduction of exNO levels (64 \u00b1 10 ppb) when compared to LPS (p < 0.05) but remained elevated when compared to SHAM (p < 0.05).

Angiotensin II induced pulmonary vasoconstriction was comparable among groups (SHAM: 2,2 \u00b1 0,3 mmHg; SHAM + TEA: 1,7 \u00b1 0,3 mmHg; LPS: 2,7 \u00b1 0,6 mmHg; LPS + TEA 2,6 \u00b1 0,3 mmHg).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1968, "end": 1971, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction:"}, {"text": "We demonstrated that the implementation of TEA in endotoxemia resulted in a downregulation of the HPV response and a reduction of exNO levels.

The underlying mechanisms to explain the pulmonary vasoregulation following TEA under healthy and septic conditions needs further investigation. Introduction: Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by macrophages (M\u03a6) is an important mechanism to effectively kill microbes. However, this beneficial effect of ROS can be deleterious for the producing cell and the surrounding tissue. Therefore, intracellular defense mechanisms exist to detoxify ROS. One of them, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), affiliates to the intracellular protective systems, to increase M\u03a6 endurance and to contribute to a confined pro-inflammatory response. Although versatile mechanisms provoking HO-1 expression in M\u03a6 are mainly attributed to Nrf2-dependent gene induction, a role of PPAR\u03b3 in regulating HO-1 expression remains controversially discussed.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "Objectives: Therefore, we aimed at clarifying the role of PPAR\u03b3 in HO-1 expression in M\u03a6. Introduction: Poly-traumatized patients who survive the initial insult are highly susceptible to secondary pneumonia, often progressing into sepsis and multi-organ failure.

Animals were resuscitated using Ringer s solution.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods"}, {"text": "Mice were then infected with a pneumolysin-producing clinical isolate of S. pneumoniae. MAP kinase activation was measured in whole lung homogenates using Western blotting, and determination of bacterial loads was done in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids and lung parenchymal tissue. Organ dysfunction was determined via automated clinical chemistry. Phagocytosis capacities and cytokine responses by blood leukocyte subsets were assessed by FACS and ELISA techniques. Results: In the lungs of mice subjected to T/H, a significant increase of p38 MAPK activation was observed. In parallel, we observed increased bacterial loads in the lungs of T/H mice infected with S. pneumoniae, reflective of innate immune suppression in these mice. Interestingly, mice subjected to T/H followed by immediate inhibition of p38 MAPK activity responded with an increased bacterial clearance to infection with S. pneumoniae compared to control groups. Moreover, elevated levels of creatinine were also significantly reduced in T/H mice treated with p38 MAPK inhibitor. In addition, p38 inhibition in T/H mice significantly decreased the phagocytosis activity of granulocytes and reduced cytokine levels in plasma (IL-6, TNF\u03b1, IL-10). Conclusions: Our data show that induction of T/H leads to a strong p38 MAPK activation in the lung, which may contribute to post-traumatic immune suppression. Early p38 MAPK inhibition subsequent to T/H leads to decreased inflammatory responses, less organ damage in the kidney and an improved lung protective immune response to bacterial challenge. Objectives: This study aimed at defining the role of the alternative complement pathway for intact and controlled innate immune responses during the onset of experimental sepsis Methods: To investigate the effect of impaired activation of the classical/alternative complement activation pathway on outcome and innate immune functions during sepsis, we conducted CLP (cecal liga-tion puncture) experiments in C1q-/-and factor D-/-mice. Mice first were monitored for various signs of sickness for 7 days. Whole blood and plasma was collected to determine organ dysfunction via automated clinical chemistry, phagocytosis assay and measurement of various Cytokines via Cytometric Bead Array (FACS Analysis). Results: C1q-/-mice started to die after 24h very rapidly and after 54h none of the animals survived. Although factor D-/-mice survived longer the mortality also reached 100 percent after approximately 4 days. Wild type mice died only within the first 36h and the survival rate was approximately 58 %. Analysis for presence of various inflammatory mediators in the serum demonstrated a significant increase for IL-6, IL-10, MCP-1, and KC 6h after CLP in control mice. In factor D-/mice this increase was significantly higher for all depicted mediators when compared to the other groups. Investigation of phagocytosis activity in neutrophils showed decreased numbers of phagocytosing neutrophils. We analyzed organ specific indicators in the serum of septic mice. Factor D-/-and C1q-/-mice displayed increased values of urea and creatinine, AST and bilirubin at 24 h post CLP when compared to wilt type mice indicating elevated organ dysfunction of kidney and liver in the knockout mice.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods"}, {"text": "Our results demonstrate an impaired survival capacity of the complement knock-out mice when compared to the wild type controls suggesting an important role for the classical and the alternative pathway for successful host response during sepsis. In addition, it can be hypothesized that factor D may have a controlling function for inflammatory responses during the onset of sepsis. Introduction: In healthy organisms the balance between pro-and antiinflammatory reactions functions as a prerequisite ensuring an appropriate immune response. The extent of the inflammatory response following an ischemic insult in the central nervous system influences the well balanced interplay of the nervous and immune system. Thereby, infections, i.e. pneumonia, are the leading cause of death in patients after ischemic insult due to CNS injury-induced immunodepression syndrome (CIDS). Furthermore ageing per se is associated with progressive incidence of immune dysregulation. Objectives: We focussed on the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (Trem-2) involved in the elimination of apoptotic cells without local inflammation to maintain brain homeostasis in healthy organisms. Since the role of Trem-2 during ageing and under ischemic conditions is still under discussion, there is increasing evidence that mutations in the gene coding Trem-2 are strongly associated with neurodegenerative disorder and infection/sepsis. Therefore, we study the role of Trem-2 as mediator of innate immune system in CNS after inflammatory insult during aging. Methods: Using qPCR we studied the gene expression pattern of Trem2 and Dap12, linked to Trem2, as well as mediators of inflammation (Tnfa and Il10) in mice brain at different age (2, 9, 15 sion of Trem2 and Dap12 declined. The expression rate of Tnfa increased during normal ageing (5 fold) as well as following MCAO (up to 17 fold). The up-regulation of Tnfa is attenuated in older mice following MCAO. Il10 is very low expressed in healthy brains and ageing per se shows no considerable effect to Il10 gene expression. Though, after MCAO Il10 was up-regulated in young animals but not influenced in elderly.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1729, "end": 1732, "text": "(2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1733, "end": 1735, "text": "9,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1736, "end": 1738, "text": "15", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "The up regulation of Trem2 as well as Dap12 after stroke attenuated with increasing age. Thus, we suggest that phagocytic activity is reduced, however inflammatory response is enhanced.

Introduction: Thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) is an integral part of a multimodal concept for pain management in acute pancreatitis in selected cases. The impact of TEA on lung injury associated with inflammation is still unkown. We have previously shown that TEA prevented a rise in exhaled nitric oxide (exNO) levels and improved the impairment of pulmonary vasoreactivity associated with experimental necrotizing pancreatitis but had no effect on pulmonary endothelial dysfunction (1) . Conversely, pulmonary endothelial dysfunction was time-dependently modulated by TEA in experimental sepsis with improvement of endothelial integrity in hyperdynamic sepsis and deterioration of endothelial function in hypodynamic sepsis (2). Objectives: We hypothezised that TEA affects pulmonary nitric oxide production and modulates pulmonary endothelial dysfunction in mild edematous pancreatitis. Methods: 18 rats were instrumented with a thoracic epidural catheter (Th 7-9). Edematous pancreatitis (EP) was induced by intraductal injection of caerulein. Rats were randomly assigned to epidural infusion of NaCl 0.9% (EP, n = 6) or bupivacaine 0.5% (EP + TEA, n = 6) at 15 \u00b5l/h for 4 h. Healthy controls (SHAM) assigned to a third group received epidural NaCl 0.9% (SHAM, n = 6). 4h post injury animals were tracheostomized and exhaled NO (exNO) was determined. The pulmonary circuit was isolated and perfused. Then bradykinin-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction (= surrogate marker of endothelial dysfunction) was investigated using an established model of isolated and perfused lungs. Therefore bradykinin was injected into the pulmonary circuit in 3 different doses (1, 3 and 6 \u00b5g). Changes in perfusion pressure (\u0394p) were measured. Differences between groups were evaluated with one-way ANOVA. Results: ExNo levels did not differ between the 3 groups (SHAM 2,2 \u00b1 0,3 ppb; EP 3,0 \u00b1 0,4 ppb, EP + TEA 1,8 \u00b1 0,5 ppb). Pulmonary integrity was maintained in SHAM animals as indicated by the absence of BK-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction (SHAM: BK 1\u00b5g 0 \u00b1 0 mmHg, BK 3\u00b5g 0 \u00b1 0 mmHg, BK 6 \u00b5g 0 \u00b1 0 mmHg). Rats with EP exhibited a significant rise in bradykinin-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction (EP: BK 1\u00b5g 0,7 \u00b1 0,3 mmHg; BK 3\u00b5g Introduction: Recent research has revealed an autonomic neural pathway that monitors and adjusts the inflammatory response, termed the inflammatory reflex. Sensory vagal afferent fibres are able to sense inflammatory mediators. The efferent arm of the inflammatory reflex has been termed the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway because acetylcholine (ACh) is the principle vagus nerve neurotransmitter. ACh is interacting with alpha7 cholinergic receptors expressed by macrophages and other cell types to inhibit production of inflammatory mediators, eg. cytokines and adhesion molecules (1, 2) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 891, "end": 894, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3220, "end": 3223, "text": "(1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3224, "end": 3226, "text": "2)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "The aim of the current study was to determine the capacity of the acetylcholine esterase inhibitor physostigmin (PhS), administered intravenously after endotoxin challenge, to inhibit endotoxininduced inflammatory responses in the rat intestinal microcirculation in vivo by intravital microscopy.

Introduction: Sepsis is a clinical syndrome that complicates severe infection and is characterized by systemic inflammation and widespread tissue injury. In face of extensive research in the past, the pathophysiology of sepsis in humans is still poorly understood. To study the underlying mechanisms of sepsis and the associated systemic inflammatory response, several experimental animal models have been developed. All models try to mimic pathophysiological changes typically seen in septic patients. Cecal ligation and puncture has become the most widely used model for experimental sepsis and is currently considered as the gold standard in sepsis research. To study the underlying mechanisms of sepsis in experimental settings CLP is considered to be a realistic model for the induction of polymicrobial sepsis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "Objectives: To present the CLP-sepsis model.

The Cecal Ligation and Puncture (CLP) model is a widely accepted sepsis model mirroring the clinical situation in septic patients and is commonly considered as the gold standard. However, the CLP-model is also known for its difficulty to control the magnitude of septic challenge due to high variability in progression and survival depending on the applied technique, bacterial composition of the bowel content or surgical operator variability. These arguments cannot be neglected in a research setting in which many investigators apply sepsis models in different projects and intend to combine their findings to look at the big picture. The Peritoneal Contamination and Infection (PCI) model, originally described by Bauhofer and co-workers and modified by us, overcomes this issue representing a highly standardized, reproducible rodent sepsis model without the necessity for a surgical procedure. Objective: To present the PCI-sepsis model Methods: For PCI, standardized human stool inoculums are injected intraperitoneally into the pelvic region. For generation of the inoculums, a stool probe of healthy non-vegetarian humans is collected and processed for \u221280\u00b0C storage. Microbiological analysis determines the composition and number of cfu for the different pertinent strains. Results: Depending on the dose of the inoculum or accompanying treatments (fluid-resuscitation, antibiotics) the sepsis model can be modified in any order-starting from a sepsis model with acute onset and high mortality to a prolonged sepsis model with high survival rates. We established different sepsis models in mice (CL57B6, Balb/ c) and rats (WISTAR) and evaluated a variety of parameters describing many aspects of PCI-induced sepsis. Introduction: The function of the acute phase protein von Willebrand factor (VWF) is regulated by ADAMTS13-mediated proteolysis, which limits its multimeric size and ability to tether platelets. Therefore, the balance between VWF and ADAMTS13 is assumed to be involved in the development of sepsis-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Objectives: We hypothesized that a decreased ADAMTS13-activity in a porcine 2-hit model of hemorrhage and sepsis is associated with laboratory and morphological findings of TMA. Methods: Animals (n=21, BW 24 kg) were subjected to hemorrhagic shock (45 min). After re-transfusion, sepsis was induced via intraperitoneal implantation of fibrin clot to restrain continuous release of 10 9 vital E.coli. Blood samples for determination of ADAMTS13-activity, VWF antigenconcentration as well as multimer pattern, for platelet count, creatinine and hematocrit (for normalization) were drawn. Directly postmortem we examined renal TMA development (CD61 staining) and ischemic acute tubular necrosis (epithelial brush border staining). Results: ADAMTS13 activity remained stable after hemorrhage, however, declined stepwise during sepsis accompanied by a strong drop off in platelet count (356 to 142 GptL-1). Moderate increase in VWF: Ag concentration was found. Densitometric analysis of VWF multimer composition revealed a shift to higher molecular weight VWF multimers, which may be a consequence of both, increased release of unprocessed protein from activated platelets and endothelial cells as well as of decreased proteolysis of circulating VWF by the protease ADAMTS13. Development of renal dysfunction was indicated by a slight, but significant increase in plasma creatinine concentration (107.0 vs. 141.0 \u00b5MolL-1, p<0.05). Characteristic findings for TMA with glomerular microthrombi in kidneys, fibrinoid necrosis of preglomerular arterioles and interlobular arteries with interstitial bleeding were observed.

Results: Both cell lines expressed ADAMTS13 mRNA as quantitated using qPCR normalized to a set of unvaried genes.

The use of a fecal peritonitis model is technically equally simple, apart from the production of the biological agent. Beyond that different standardised bacterial-or fungi solutions can be used. They can be derived from human or animal faces or might contain isolated microbiological colonies. CLP/ CASP models are related to clinical needs since leakage of the gut is a common cause for abdominal sepsis in human patients. The animals used for experiments in septical research are usually pigs, rats, or mice.

The achieved blood concentrations of HES were comparable. To achieve the same hematocrit, significantly higher amounts of 6% HES 130 (1.9 \u00b1 0.2 g/ kg) had to be administered compared to other groups (6% HES 200 1.5 \u00b1 0.2, 10% HES 130 1.3 \u00b1 0.5 and 10% HES 200 1.3 \u00b1 0.2, P < 0.05).

Introduction: Monocyte/ macrophage desensitization contributes to immune paralysis during sepsis. This hypo-inflammatory sepsis phase is the main cause of death within septic patients. One characteristic feature of desensitized monocytes/macrophages is PKC\u03b1 depletion. A crucial function of PKC\u03b1 is activation of the NADPH oxidase system, which generates superoxide radicals. This oxidative burst is important for pathogen killing. Thus, preventing PKC\u03b1 depletion in monocyte/ macrophage might be useful to improve septic outcome.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Models of peritonitis and abdominal sepsis"}, {"text": "Objectives: Therefore, this study was designed to identify a pretreatment attenuating PKC\u03b1 depletion during endotoxic shock in mice. Methods: Intra peritoneal application of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 24 h provoked PKC\u03b1 depletion in CD11b+ splenocytes. In line, reactive oxygen species formation in response to a phorbolester (PMA) in vitro in peritoneal macrophages was abolished. Rosiglitazone pretreatment of mice for 30 min before LPS challenge, abrogates PKC\u03b1 depletion in CD11b+ splenocytes and consequently restores the oxidative burst in response to PMA in vitro.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Models of peritonitis and abdominal sepsis"}, {"text": "In Mac-PPAR\u03b3-KO mice, LPS injection causes PKC\u03b1 depletion similar to PPAR\u03b3 wild type mice.

Conclusions: Our data provide evidence that pre-activation of PPAR\u03b3 inhibits PKC\u03b1 depletion in CD11b+ splenocytes and peritoneal macrophages and accordingly restored the oxidative burst in an endotoxic shock model. Preventing these established molecular markers of monocyte/ macrophage desensitization in sepsis might be useful to improve septic outcome with a special concern to immune paralysis. Introduction: Severe sepsis, septic shock, and resulting organ failure represent the most common cause of death in intensive care medicine, with mortality ranging from 40% to 70%. It is still unclear whether necrosis or apoptosis plays the predominant role in severe sepsis. Objectives: Determining the prevalent mode of cell death would be valuable, as new therapeutic agents (eg, antiapoptotic drugs such as caspase inhibitors) may improve unsatisfactory outcomes in patients with severe sepsis. Methods: In total, 147 patients (101 patients with severe sepsis, 28 postoperative patients after major abdominal surgery, 18 healthy volunteers) were enrolled. Baseline and clinical data were evaluated. Blood samples from patients with severe sepsis were collected at the time of sepsis diagnosis, and 48 and 120 hours later; samples from healthy volunteers were collected once, and from postoperative patients, once immediately after surgery. We measured caspase-cleaved and uncleaved Cytokeratin-18 (CK-18, intermediate filament protein) as a marker of cell death, isolated CK-18 fragments as a marker of apoptosis, as well as interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (sVCAM-1), and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM-1). Results: Age and sex of patients with severe sepsis and postoperative patients were comparable, whereas healthy volunteers were significantly younger. In healthy volunteers, the mode of cellular turnover was primarily apoptotic cell death. Postoperative patients showed comparable levels of apoptotic activity, but necrotic cell death was markedly increased, probably due to surgical tissue injury. In contrast, patients with severe sepsis showed increased levels of markers for both apoptotic and necrotic cell death. Patients with sepsis who died showed more pronounced necrotic cell death at later stages. Conclusions: Loss of parenchymal cells due to necrosis appears to be the primary mode of cell death in patients who die from severe sepsis. This may limit possible therapeutic options. Introduction: Human-pathogenic fungi have developed various immune evasion strategies including the acquisition of complement regulators from human plasma, such as factor H (CFH), that may protect the fungi against the host complement system. The possible role of these proteins in facilitating host responses, however, got little attention to date. Objectives: Because CFH can bind to certain host cells, we analyzed the role of CFH and other CFH family proteins in neutrophil-yeast interaction. Methods: Candida albicans (SC5314) and blood-derived human neutrophils were used in these studies. Binding of CFH family proteins was determined by flow cytometry, Western blot and ELISA. For receptor binding studies, monoclonal antibodies recognizing CD11b, CD11c, CD18 and control antibodies were applied. Neutrophil adhesion and generation of reactive oxygen species were measured in fluorescence assays. Lactoferrin and IL-8 were determined by ELISA from supernatants of yeast-neutrophil co-cultures. Results: Both the opportunistic pathogenic yeast C. albicans and human neutrophils bound the CFH family proteins CFH, CFH-like protein 1 (CFHL1), and CFH-related proteins 1 (CFHR1) and 4 (CFHR4), both from plasma and as recombinant proteins. The main binding sites responsible for interaction with neutrophils were localized to the seventh and the two C-terminal domains of CFH, using recombinant CFH fragments. Related domains in CFHL1, CFHR1 and CFHR4 appear responsible for binding of these CFH family proteins to neutrophils. The integrin CD11b/CD18 was identified as the major cellular receptor for CFH, CFHL1 and CFHR1, but not for CFHR4. Adhesion of neutrophils to C. albicans was increased by CFH, CFHL1 and CFHR1. Furthermore, yeast-bound CFH and CFHR1 enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species and the release of the antimicrobial protein lactoferrin by neutrophils. In the presence of CFH, killing of C. albicans by neutrophils was increased. Conclusions: While pathogen-bound CFH, CFHL1 and CFHR4 may play a role in downregulating complement activation at the microbial surface, we identify CFH, CFHL1 and CFHR1 as three related proteins that enhance neutrophil adhesion via CD11b/CD18. Furthermore, the results show that CFH and CFHR1, when bound on the surface of C. albicans, enhance antimicrobial activity of human neutrophils. Therapy of infectious diseases with special regard to bacterial sepsis Introduction: In this preclinical project specially designed peptides (antimicrobial peptides, AMP) based on variations of amino acid sequences from binding domains of natural lipopolysaccharide-binding proteins are studied with respect to their suitability to be effective (i) against bacterial infectious diseases, in general and (ii) as anti-sepsis agents, in particular.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results:"}, {"text": "Brandenburg K (1), Schuerholz T (2), Hornef M (3)(1)", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Translational Sepsis Research"}, {"text": "The main aim of this preclinical study is to design effective anti-endotoxin agents, which are able to neutralize isolated lipopolysaccharide aggregates with the aim to inhibit the LPS-induced inflammation reaction.

Transcriptional profiling of eed1\u0394 during RHE infections revealed the downregulation of hyphal associated genes as well as the downregulation of the important transcription factor Ume6. Remarkable, the eed1\u0394 mutant produces only transient filaments and switches back to yeast cell growth after filaments had been formed, leading to a pure yeast cell population. Ectopic overexpression of Ume6 in eed1\u0394 mutant cells prevented budding of yeast cells from filaments and restored hyphal growth. This bypass was also observed on the transcriptional level with the expression of hyphal associated genes at a level similar to wild type Conclusions: The unique C. albicans EED1 gene encodes for a central regulator of hyphal growth. Although it is not required for initial induction of filamentous growth it is essential for its maintenance and for full virulence in several in vitro and in vivo models. We could show that the key transcription factor Ume6 is a downstream target of Eed1, suggesting that both act in a novel pathway that regulates the maintenance of hyphal growth in C. albicans. Introduction: Blood is generally sterile and represents a hostile environment for microorganisms. However, the human pathogenic yeast Candida albicans can disseminate in the host via the bloodstream and cause life threatening systemic infections and sepsis in immunocompromised individuals. Our previous work has shown that blood components influence the morphology, viability and transcriptional response of C. albicans. Of the various blood components, neutrophils apparently have the strongest effect on C. albicans (Fradin et al., 2003; Fradin et al., 2005) . It has been shown that neutrophils discriminate between the morphological stages of C. albicans (Wozniok et al., 2007) . Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which neutrophils detect, inhibit and kill C. albicans remain poorly understood. Objectives: We aim to elucidate the C. albicans response during the interaction with neutrophils and to identify fungal components which are important to overcome the attack by this immune cells. Ongoing experiments concentrate on the analysis of single cells exposed to neutrophils using GFP reporter strains, the interaction of yeast and hyphal cells of wild type and mutant strains with neutrophils. Methods: Human neutrophils were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy donors using gradient centrifugation. To determine fungal cell damage by neutrophils, XTT assays were performed. Neutrophil migration towards Candida cells was measured via a transwell system. To investigate the interaction of our reporter strains with neutrophils, fluorescence microscopy was used and a differential staining method was established. Results: Single cell analysis approaches show that certain genes, like the ammonium permease MEP2 are expressed after 1 h of incubation with neutrophils indicating nitrogen starvation. Expression of MEP2 was contact dependent. The phagocytic index of C. albicans cells in contact to neutrophils was 95%.

Since 95% of C. albicans cells in contact with neutrophils were phagocytosed, it can be concluded that phagocytosis causes nitrogen starvation. In addition, factors regulating the yeast-to-hyphal transition of C. albicans directly or indirectly regulate fungal survival during the interaction with neutrophils. Introduction: Candida glabrata is, after C. albicans, the second most important human pathogenic yeast and an emerging pathogen , which is difficult to treat, particularly due to a high antifungal resistance of this fungus. Pathogenicity mechanisms of C. glabrata are largely unknown. However, immune evasion strategies may play key roles since C. glabrata causes very little inflammation in mouse models of infection despite tissue colonisation. Additionally it has been proposed that C. glabrata can withstand killing by macrophages and even replicates inside. Objectives: We aim to dissect the interaction between C. glabrata and human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) to identify the immune evasion strategies that enable C. glabrata to survive phagocytosis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "049"}, {"text": "We studied different stages of the C. glabrata -MDM interaction including adhesion, internalisation and phagosome maturation, by immunofluorescence microscopy and transelectron microscopy.

The production of reactive oxygen species by MDMs was investigated by luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence and damage of MDMs was quantified by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the culture supernatant. With the help of a caspase 3/7 assay we also analysed the induction of MDM apoptosis by C. glabrata. Genome wide microarrays were used to monitor the transcriptional profile of C. glabrata during phagocytosis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods:"}, {"text": "We observed that C. glabrata-containing phagosomes rapidly recruit the endosomal and lysosomal marker Eea1 and Lamp1, indicating a fusion with early and late endosomes and lysosomes. Transelectron microscopy confirms the existence of a phagolysosomal membrane. However, staining with Lysotracker-Red showed that phagolysosomes containing living C. glabrata, but not phagolysosomes containing heat-killed cells, lack acidification. Analysis of transcriptional profiles support the view that C. glabrata cells within MDMs were not exposed to an acidic pH. Despite significant intracellular proliferation of fungal cells, apoptosis or damage of macrophages was not apparent and the production of reactive oxygen species was scavenged. Introduction: Secreted aspartic proteases (Saps) are important virulence factors of the human-pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. They are involved in various aspects of infection such as epithelial surface interaction and immune evasion. Two members of the Sap family, Sap9 and Sap10 are, in contrast to other Saps, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored on the cell surface. We have previously shown that both proteases function in cell surface integrity and composition, fungal attributes with a major impact on host-pathogen interaction. Objectives: We aim to investigate the role of Sap9 and Sap10 in fungal-phagocyte interaction and to characterise potential protease targets on the fungal cell surface. Methods: C. albicans mutants lacking SAP9 or SAP10 were co-incubated with human monocytic cells (THP-1 cell line) and subsequently stained for immunofluorescence microscopy. Filamentation was monitored under different hyphae-inducing conditions. Cell wall proteins processed by Sap9 and Sap10 were identified via LC/MS/MS. Results: We found that sap9 deletion mutants expose beta-glucan. This cell wall component is a potent proinflammatory molecule that is normally masked by a mannoprotein layer. Recognition of betaglucan contributes to uptake and killing of the fungus by phagocytes. Indeed we could show that deletion of SAP9 causes a stronger ingestion of C. albicans by human macrophages.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results:"}, {"text": "Another key aspect during infection is hyphal formation.

Methods: Whole blood samples (200 \u00b5l) of healthy male volunteers (n=12) were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (final concentration 0,2 ng/ml) in cell culture medium and incubated with Normal Saline (NaCl 0,9%), Human albumine 5% (HA), Gelatine 4% (GEL), HES 10% (200/0,5) and HES 6% (130/0,42) at final concentrations of 10%, 25% and 40% of the original blood sample volume at 37\u00b0C and CO2 (5%) humified atmosphere for 3 hours.

Introduction: Despite the progress in modern medicine, sepsis is still a major health problem challenging fast diagnostics and effective therapies. New approaches for diagnostics and therapy were developed in the past but were not yet able to significantly decrease overall sepsis mortality, which still reaches rates of up to sixty percent.

Methods: Ficoll-isolated peripheral blood or bone marrow derived mononuclear cells were depleted from non-adherent cells following 2h of plastic-adherence. Following 4 weeks of cell culture, hemophagocytes were fixed for TEM. Chemical fixation and high pressure freezing method were used alternatively (Buser et al, 2008) . A total of 6 patients (3 sepsis) and 3 HLH were studied. Results: Ultrastructural studies identified phagocytosis of autologous erythrocytes and fully viable leukocytes, including other hemophagocytes itself by cultured hemophagocytes of both, pediatric genetic and non-genetic HLH as well as secondary HLH/MAS in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Phagocytosis appears to co-exist with impressive autophagy and impaired phago-lysosome fusion, mitochondrial degradation and multivesicular body formation. The autophagic signatures are entirely identical between HLH and sepsis associated hemophagocytosis but, the shape and flexibility of the nucleus is distinct in that pediatric HLH nuclei of hemophagocytes are polymorph in shape and highly flexible, whereas sepsis associated hemophagocytes are predominantly round and rigid. High pressure freeze fixation techniques further revealed the asymmetric double membrane of autophagic membranes and illustrates two types of vesicle fusion mechanisms, the one occurring by digestion of the inner lipid bilayer of each of the fusion membrane partners and the second by engulfing the vesicle fusion partner without membrane degradation. This latter process explains the occurrence of as yet multiple double layer membrane containing vesicles. Conclusions: The present study illustrates novel aspects of APC pathology to explain immunedysfunction against virus reactivation and bacterial infection. The induction of autophagy may impair antigen presentation. Whether autophagy itself may explain the prominent hemophagocytosis of autologous and viable leukocytes remains an issue of further investigation. Splenectomy is not protective in abdominal sepsisa retrospective study Introduction: Infections are a major cause of mortality and morbidity in ICU. Respiratory tract infections, followed by intraabdominal infections (IAI) and primary bloodstream infections were most common. Considering septic patients after general surgery, IAI is the predominant focus (85%). The mortality of septic patients remains unacceptably high. Objectives: The proinflammatory cytokine imbalance during severe sepsis can be reduced by the nervous system via a reflex of the vagus nerve that is termed the cholinergic antiinflammatory pathway (CAIP). The spleen plays an important regulatory role in the innate immunology. In addition, it has been postulated that the spleen is an essential target of the CAIP. Therefore, a splenectomy might attenuate the limiting effects of CAIP. However, recent experimental findings revealed that a splenectomy could be protective in septic IAI. Thereby, the systemic release of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) triggered by splenic apotosis was significantly reduced after splenectomy. HMGB1 is described as a crucial mediator in lethal sepsis. Therefore, we evaluated mortality and morbidity of surgical ICU patients with proven IAI depending on whether they did undergo former splenectomy or not. Methods: This is a retrospective, non-randomized, single-center. All patients were treated for severe sepsis or septic shock due to a surgically proven IAI. Splenectomized patients served as study population in comparison to non-splenectomized controls. Survival was defined as the main outcome criterion. Time to death, ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, need of renal replacement procedures, and need of re-laparotomy served as secondary outcome criteria. Results: 284 patients were included. 27 (9.5%) did underwent splenectomy before the development of sepsis symptoms. Both populations were well balanced due to gender, age, biometric characteristics. In the control population more patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were observed whereas in the study group more subjects suffered for diabetes mellitus. There was no significant difference in mortality between both groups ( Objectives: The aim of the study was to compare the phagocytic function and the kinetics of phagosome-lysosome fusion in leukocytes from patients with sepsis, septic shock, before and after G-CSF (Neupogen) with the activity exhibited by healthy donors.

Introduction: Arginine vasopressin (AVP) as the strongest endogenous vasopressor in terms of maximal contractile effect induced and its duration has found growing interest in the therapy of vasoplegic states, e.g. patients with septic shock. In these patients a decrease of a metalloprotease (ADAMTS13) with inactivating activity against the ultra-large, highly thrombogenic form of Von Willebrand Factor (UL-VWF) has been described. Subsequent formation of VWF-rich microthrombi impairs the microcirculation and administration of a stabilized analogue of AVP results in a decrease of ADAMTS13/ appearance of ULVWF in plasma. Objectives: We prooved the hypothesis whether AVP-administration has an effect on VWF/ADAMTS13 balance in plama in patients with septic shock. Methods: Twenty patients with septic shock (12 male, 8 female) were enrolled. AVP was administered in a dosage of 2 IU/kg/h over 2 hours. Hemodynamic and haemostaseological parameters, platelet count and urine output were analyzed. Oral mucosal tissue oxygen saturation (SO2), microcirculatory blood flow and flow velocity were measured with a laser Doppler flowmetry and remission spectroscopy system (O2C). ADAMTS13 activity was determined using the Kokame method.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "Results: AVP administration did not change cardiac output, but resulted in significant decrease of oral mucosal oxygen saturation, blood flow and a significant decrease of flow velocity.

Furthermore, urine output increased (125; 20-480 vs. 210; 30-690 ml/h). AVP administration causes a deterioration of oral mucosal blood flow independent of macrocirculatory conditions. This was accompanied by a further decrease of ADAMTS13 activity from declined baseline levels in patients with septic shock, which may result in secondary AVP induced platelet aggregation, collateral formation of VWF-rich microthrombi and subsequent occlusion of microvessels, which may be reflected by platelet consumption and impaired microcirculation. Conclusions: Therefore, besides its beneficial vasoconstrictive effects, AVP administration may be reconsidered due to potential aggravation of organ dysfunction subsequent to triggering thrombotic-microangiopathic complications. Methods: In order to investigate whether bck1, mkk2 and mpkA, are involved in CWI signalling, we generated deletion mutants by replacing every gene with a resistance marker gene. The obtained mutants were phenotypically characterised and challenged against cell-wall acting compounds using a growth extension assay. Induction of pyomelanin formation was performed by culturing the mutant strains in presence of 10 mM L-tyrosine. Pigment formation was spectroscopically measured at a wavelength of 405 nm. Formation of 4-maleylacetoacetate was spectroscopically measured in vitro and HmgA activity consequentially deduced. Results: Deletion of bck1, mkk2 and mpkA resulted in severe sensitivity of the mutants against cell wall disturbing compounds and drastic alterations of the fungal morphology. Nevertheless, no influence on virulence of the mpkA deletion mutant was observed in a murine infection model. Pyomelanin formation was significantly increased in the bck1, mkk2 and mpkA strains, and the total HmgA activity was significantly reduced compared to the wild type.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "We functionally characterized bck1, mkk2 and mpkA in A. fumigatus confirming their role for CWI.

Reduced heart rate complexity using poincar\u00e9 plots parallels an increase in both pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines during severe septic shock Introduction: Different models of septic shock have demonstrated an intense elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokine serum levels, followed by an anti-inflammatory response.

In addition, we measured every day Specific Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFA) and \u0394SOFA (SOFA maximum-SOFA admission) as an index of severity of illness.

Conclusions: Our data suggest that an increase in both pro-and antiinflammatory cytokine serum levels is associated with a loss of complexity of heart rate signals, particularly in surgical septic patients with increased morbidity, supporting the hypothesis of a possible pathophysiologic link between autonomic dysfunction and inflammatory response. Introduction: Sepsis is the presence of organisms with the blood, it has a high prevalence within patients presenting at Emergency Departments (ED) and if untreated can progress to life threatening severe sepsis or septic shock. In recent years there has been research into predictive tools regarding mortality in septic patients in adult EDs. Recent work has focused on models that can provide quick assessment using information that is commonly collected in the ED. The Mortality in Emergency Department Sepsis (MEDS) score has been found to be the best performing models in predicting 28 day mortality. The original US based MEDS scoring system has been abbreviated by Vorwerk et al in 2009 making it applicable for UK ED use. Objectives: To retrospectively assess the abbreviated MEDS scoring system and so either confirming or refuting reports of it as an accurate method of predicting mortality in adult septic patients within the ED. To assess the potential of the abbreviated MEDS scoring system as an integrated element of routine assessment of adult septic patients presenting at the ED. To establish whether any differences in management exist between high risk surviving and non-surviving septic patients who present at the ED. If identified, make recommendations for future management changes within the ED for the management of sepsis. Methods: An interval sample of 3 months starting from 1st January 2009 was chosen for selection of patients. 101 patients were identified through a search of the NGH patient administration system for key words sepsis or septic, of these 99 cases were available for viewing, a further 13 were excluded as they had been inappropriately coded. To assess the abbreviated MEDS score for the 72 septic cases, information was obtained from patient ED cards and blood results recorded on the hospital ICE system. Treatment of the high risk surviving and non-surviving septic patients who presented at the ED was compared relative to the initial resuscitation bundle recommended as part of the 2008 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. Results: The data required to formulate an abbreviated MEDS score for patients with sepsis was generally present for all patients. Only 6 cases were excluded because of missing information, these were all because of no recorded Glasgow Coma Score (GCS). Of these 66 patients the average patient age was 72.5 years (95% CI 76.1 -68.9 years). The oldest effected patient was 96 and the youngest 23. Fifty percent of patients were female and 50% male. The 28 day mortality of the study population was 21.2%. At 28-days, fifty two of the patients had survived and 14 had not. The abbreviated MEDS score ranged from 0-16 (95% CI 6.7 -8.4) for the surviving patients and from 5-13 (95% CI 9.0 -10.0) for the non-surviving group. A P-value of 0.0063 shows that the abbreviated MEDS score is an accurate tool for identifying septic patients at higher risk of death within 28 days. Categorisation of patients into low (0-4 points), moderate (5-12 points) and high (>12 points) risk groups on the basis of their abbreviated MEDS scores found that 15.1% of the patients were in the low risk group (28-day mortality 0%), 77.3% in the moderate risk group (28day mortality 24%) and 7.5% in the high risk group (28-day mortality 20%). Comparison of high-risk surviving (abbreviated MEDS score >11) and non-surviving patients shows differences in management. Of significance: The sensitivity and specificity of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) in acute kidney injury -a systematic review and meta-analysis Objectives: The present study attempted to identify the diagnostic significance of investigated markers in acute abdominal conditions, preoperatively, as well postoperatively during the first 3 days. Methods: This was prospective clinical study on 98 operated patients with acute abdominal conditions who have preoperatively met the established criteria for SIRS, 58 of which had positive bacteriological findings from peritoneal cavity and were included in the sepsis group, while 40 were included in non-infectious SIRS group. The investigated biomarkers were observed from preoperative period and during the first 3 postoperative days. Results: Preoperative PCT concentrations were significantly higher within the sepsis group than they were within the SIRS group (median (interquartile range) 2.32 (7.41) ng/ml vs. 0.45(2.62) ng/ml). A cut-off value of 1.1 ng/ml yielded 72.4% sensitivity and 62.5% specificity. (AUC=0.740; PPV=73.7%; NPV=61.0%). Postoperatively, AT III (AUC=0.677; Sens.=70.2%; Spec.=67.5%) and Protein C (AUC=0.669; Sens.=70.2%; Spec.=67.5%) shoved significant accuracy. The other parameters did not identify abdominal sepsis in early period. Conclusions: PCT was the only marker that can be helpful in preoperative diagnosis of abdominal sepsis. PCT was the only marker that showed diagnostic significance, both preoperatively, and postoperatively, on all days of measurement. Diagnostic significance that was reached by AT III and Protein C postoperatively was reached by PCT preoperatively. Conclusions: Prove-it TM Sepsis was considered to be a fast, robust, and high performance diagnostic platform which is easily implemented into everyday laboratory workflow. Both study sites identified patient cases where timely information provided by Prove-it TM Sepsis would have significantly improved patient management. Examples here include more rational management and antibiotic choice subsequent to earlier differentiation of 'Gram-positive cocci in clumps' into MRSA, MSSA, or coagulase negative staphylococci, and earlier speciation of Gram-negative organisms. After the performance evaluation study, the pathogen panel of Prove-itTM Sepsis is further configured for detection of Candida spp. and new bacterial targets, i.e., Neisseria non-meningitidis, Kingella kingae, and Propionibacterium acnes. The assay identifies now 60 out of the 302 samples that were not covered during the performance evaluation, increasing the pathogen coverage from 86% to 89%. Prove-it TM Sepsis has also been evaluated with highly promising results for the diagnostics of bone and joint infections using bone biopsy and articular fluid as sample types. These evaluation studies have demonstrated excellent performance for this DNA-based diagnostic platform for various diagnostic applications. The earlier speciation provided by Prove-it TM Sepsis could contribute to faster, more evidence-based patient management and positive outcomes. Introduction: Fungal blood stream infections (BSI) especially candidemia remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care setting. US data report an increasing incidence and a changing epidemiology of fungal infections in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Methods: CDC standard definitions were used for diagnosis of ICU acquired laboratory confirmed primary BSI and these data were re- Conclusions: Contrary to reports from the US, in German ICUs there was neither a significant change in the incidence of fungal nosocomial BSI nor in the distribution of pathogens (gram-positive, gram-negative and fungal). ID of C.albicans BSI was only a fifth of the ID in US American ICUs (0.04 versus 0.27). Therefore, it seems most worthwhile to consider the regional situation. C. albicans is nonetheless the sixth most frequent pathogen in nosocomial BSI and has a crude ICUmortality of 23%.

Second, more than 1000 hospital patients at high risk of infection were screened for nasal colonization in a prospective study. 15 patients later developed S. aureus bacteraemia. The infecting strains were isolated and patients' sera obtained before onset, at diag-nosis and during the course of infection. The secreted staphylococcal proteins from the colonizing and infecting strains were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and quantitative immunoblots with the human sera were performed. Results: In the healthy volunteers there was a large inter-individual variability in spot patterns and spot intensities already before experimental colonization with S. aureus 8325-4. Only rarely we observed additional spots or increased spot intensities after experimental colonization with S. aureus, mostly in carriers. Bacteremia, in contrast, elicited a strong humoral immune response to the infecting strain with characteristic differences between endogenous and exogenous infection. Before onset of bacteremia, S. aureus carriers exhibited much stronger antibody binding to antigens of the infecting strain than did non-carriers. The complex binding patterns of carriers were largely conserved during infection, but spot intensities increased up to 45fold. Exogenous S. aureus strains, however, elicited antibody binding to large numbers of novel antigens. Conclusions: Minor infections rather than epithelial colonization are the likely triggers of humoral anti-staphylococcal immunity in the healthy population. The protective potential of these antibodies in bacteremia remains to be determined. Introduction: Septifast\u00ae is a multiplex real-time PCR assay for detection of bacteria and fungi DNA in blood. Blood culture remains the gold standard but has several limitations as a large time needed, false positive results due to contaminations and false negative results due to antibiotic treatment Objectives: Our aim is to check up on the presence of concordance between the results of PCR technique and standard BC in septic and non septic patients. We also want to verify a correlation between the resistance to the empiric antibiotic therapy of detected microorganisms and the presence of concordance between the two methods. Methods: A total of 42 episodes (combined BC and PCR samples) were collected from 38 patients: 27 of them were considered as cases (according to ACCP/SCCM sepsis criteria); 15 were considered as controls. All patients were treated with empiric antibiotic therapy at the time of testing. We obtained 21 ml of blood from each patient using sterile technique; 7 ml were inoculated into each Bactec aerobic, anaerobic, fungi blood bottle. Immediately after, 5 ml were obtained and inoculated into EDTA tube as PCR sample. Both procedures were started at the same time. If positive, Bactec was followed by standard microbiological identification protocol and antibiogram. Results: Septifast was positive in 20 cases and negative in 7 cases.

Standard diagnostics is based on blood culturing (BC). However, limitations of BC include relatively low sensitivities and a long time-to-result for the identification of the pathogen, generally over two days and more.

ROTEM is a point-of-care method that reflects more closely than classical coagulation tests the in vivo haemostasis and the contribution of fibrinogen and platelets to clot formation.

Methods: So far 17 patients of a surgical intensive care unit were included within 24 h after they had met the criteria of severe sepsis or septic shock. ROTEM (Pentapharm, Munich) was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction on four consecutive days.

Methods: This prospective study consisted of all consecutive adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass between January 2003 and October 2005. The SOFA score was calculated daily until discharge. Initial SOFA score, maximum SOFA score, and delta-SOFA scores (differences between subsequent scores) were calculated and their correlations with mortality were assessed. Results: A total of 2372 patients with a mean age of 66,2 +-11,2 years were admitted to the ICU after cardiac surgery. The operations performed were 1518 (64 %) isolated CABG, 332 (14 %) isolated valve surgery, 237 (10 %) combined CABG with valve surgery, 95 (4 %) surgery of the thoracic aorta, and 190 (8 %) other procedures. The overall mortality rate was n=85 (3,6 %). The mean stay on the ICU was 3,0 +-6,1 days. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the maximum SOFA score was excellent with a value of 0,97.

Conclusions: The highest SOFA Score during the ICU stay showed an excellent discrimination. Serial evaluation of the SOFA Score during the first 96 hours is a good indicator of prognosis in cardiac surgical patients. Introduction: In the commonly used 1992 ACCP/SCCM consensus conference definitions for sepsis, severe sepsis is defined as sepsis plus organ dysfunction or hypoperfusion. However, besides lactic acidosis and oliguria, limits for organ dysfunction variables have not been given in the 1992 publication. Later on, it has been recommended to define organ dysfunction, and thus, severe sepsis by exceeding two points in at least one organ system using the \"Sequential Organ Failure Assessement\" (SOFA) score. However, it has not been validated how the prevalence of various stages of sepsis and mortality rates differ in the same patient population, if organ dysfunctions are defined with cut-offs at 1, 2, 3, or 4 points of the SOFA score in one organ system. Objectives: The present study was performed to compare the prevalence of severe sepsis and ICU mortality rates, and to find out the case mix within the same collective of critically ill postoperative/posttraumatic patients applying the sepsis definitions with increasing cut-offs of organ dysfunction points in the SOFA score. Methods: Retrospective observational single-centre study in surgical critically ill patients admitted to an University adult ICU. From 01/2007 to 12/2008, 1355 admissions were surveyed daily computer-assisted with respect to organ dysfunctions defined by the SOFA score and to different stages of sepsis, defined by the 1992 ACCP/SCCM sepsis definitions. Organ dysfunction was defined as lactic acidosis or oliguria, or if patients reached 1 -4 points in at least one organ system (lung, coagulation, liver, kidney) using the SOFA score. For each patient, the first day with the worst degree of sepsis severity defined with a cut-off of 1 point in the SOFA score in at least one organ system during his/her ICU stay was compared with the corresponding scores defined with a cut-off of 2, 3 or 4 points on the same day. Results: Within the same patient collective, applying a cut-off of 1, 2, 3 or 4 points in the SOFA score, resulted in a decrease of cases classified as SIRS or septic shock, i.e., from 642, 535, 357 to 218 out of 1355 cases, however an increase in mortality rate from 19% (124/642), 22% (115/535), 26% (91/357) to 33% (71/218), respectively.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction:"}, {"text": "The prevalence and mortality rates of SIRS and septic shock differ using different cut-offs in the SOFA score.

Results: Patients (n=303) received prophylaxis (n=29), empiric therapy (n=140), pre-emptive therapy (n=85) or definitive therapy (n=49). Major risk factors for fungal infection included recent use of broad spectrum antibiotics (95%) and central venous catheters (97%). A total of 407 mycology results were available from 251 patients. Candida was the most common isolate (393/407 isolates, 97%). Candida albicans was present in 190/407 isolates (47%), non-albicans Candida in 92/407 isolates (23%), and non-specified Candida in 111/407 isolates (27.3%). A total of 298 patients (98.4%) initiated IV fluconazole as first line therapy. Complete response was evident in 66% of prophylactic group, 55% of empiric group, 45% of pre-emptive group, and 43% of definitive group patients. The overall mortality rate was 42%. Age \u226565 years, number of non-IV fluconazole treatment cycles, colonization with Candida not specified as C. albicans, and continuous renal replacement therapy including hemodialysis (CRRT) were the strongest predictors of treatment failure in univariate analyses overall. The presence of Candida not specified as C. albicans, prior fungal colonization and CRRT were significant negative predictors of empiric therapy treatment response in the multivariate analysis. The mean length of hospital stay (LOS) for patients from initiation of IV fluconazole therapy to ICU discharge was 12.7 \u00b1 16.1 days; the mean LOS from initiation of IV fluconazole therapy to hospital discharge was 37.9 \u00b1 46.9 days. Conclusions: Our study informs treatment decision makers that approximately 23% of the identified isolates within participating sites belonged to non-albicans Candida, highlighting the importance of appropriate therapy. Introduction: The development of resistance by bacterial species is a compelling issue to reconsider indications and administration of antibiotic treatment. Adequate indications and duration of therapy are particularly important for the use of highly potent substances in the intensive care setting. Until recently, no laboratory marker has been available to differentiate bacterial infection from viral or non-infectious inflammatory reaction, however, over the past years, procalcitonin (PCT) is the first among a large array of inflammatory variables that offers this possibility. Objectives: The present study aimed to investigate the clinical usefullness of PCT for guiding antibiotic therapy in surgical intensive care patients. Methods: All patients requiring antibiotic therapy based on confirmed or highly suspected bacterial infections and at least 2 concomitant systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned to either a PCT-guided (study group) or a standard (control group) antibiotic regimen. Antibiotic therapy in the PCT-guided group was discontinued, if clinical signs and symptoms of infection improved and PCT decreased to <1 ng/ml or the PCT value was >1 ng/ml, but had dropped to 25-35% of the initial value over 3 days. In the control group antibiotic treatment was applied as standard regimen over 8 days. Results: A total of 110 surgical intensive care patients receiving antibiotic therapy after confirmed or high grade suspected infections were enrolled in this study. In 57 patients antibiotic therapy was guided by daily PCT and clinical assessment and adjusted accordingly. The control group comprised 53 patients with a standardized duration of antibiotic therapy over 8 days. Demographic and clinical data were comparable in both groups. However, in the PCT group the duration of antibiotic therapy was significantly shorter than compared to controls (5.9\u00b11.7 vs. 7.9\u00b10.5 days, p<0.001) without negative effects on clinical outcome. Conclusions: Monitoring of PCT is a helpful tool for guiding antibiotic treatment in surgical intensive care patients. This may contribute to an optimized antibiotic regimen with beneficial effects on microbial resistances and costs in intensive care medicine. Introduction: The incidence and clinical relevance of rare invasive fungal infections as a cause of sepsis is increasing worldwide. Immunosuppressed patients, such as those with haematological malignancies are at a particular risk. Reliable information on their clinical course, diagnosis and treatment is scarce. Objectives: To determine the clinical pattern of disease, to describe and improve diagnostic procedures, and therapeutic regimens, as well as to facilitate the exchange of clinical isolates, we are coordinating a global registry for rare invasive fungal infections. Methods: Patients with cultural, histopathological, antigen, or molecular biologic evidence of invasive fungal infection may be included into the study. Those with infections due to Aspergillus spp., Candida spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, Pneumocystis jiroveci or any endemic fungal infection, such as coccidioidomycosis or histoplasmosis, as well as colonization or other non-invasive infections are excluded. Data entry is accomplished via a web-based electronic case report form under www.fungiscope.net Results: By now, 90 patients with rare invasive fungal infections from a wide variety of pathogens have been included. The most common underlying conditions were chemotherapy for a hematologic malignancy (23 %, n=21), diabetes mellitus (23 %, n=21), hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (18 %, n=16), and/or stay at an intensive care unit (16 %, n=14). The lungs were the most common site of infection (34 %, n=31), followed by paranasal sinuses (17 %, n=15) and soft tissues (16 %, n=14). 22 patients displayed disseminated disease. At the latest assessment, complete response to antifungal therapy was observed in 41 % (n=37).

Introduction: Therapy of sepsis continues to be largely supportive and new therapeutic interventions with clinical outcome benefits are clearly needed. Nevertheless, an improving understanding of sepsis pathophysiology has created new opportunities for advances in the clinical management of patients with this syndrome. Since inflammatory mediators play a major pathophysiologic role, their modulation Clinical Sepsis Research -Therapy by extracorporeal dialysis-based modalities may be a rational approach. In this regard, although conventional continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) techniques have little ability to influence mediator concentrations, modified approaches may be beneficial. One such modified approach is a highly permeable CRRT membrane having pore dimensions that allow for substantial removal of solutes with molecular weights in the inflammatory mediator range (approximately 5 kDa to 50 kDa). As such, this high-cut off (HCO) membrane, manufactured by Gambro (Hechingen, Germany), extends the molecular removal spectrum beyond that which occurs in conventional dialysis techniques. Objectives: The purpose of this presentation is to discuss the clinical results reported from several studies in which the Gambro HCO membrane has been applied in septic patients. Methods: The review will focus on the effect of HCO therapy on plasma cytokine clearance and concentrations, immunologic and hemodynamic parameters, and safety-related parameters reported from the studies. Results: The review will present data demonstrating that HCO membranes effectively remove inflammatory mediators from blood and that treatment using HCO membranes has beneficial effects on immune cell function.

Introduction: Therapy of sepsis continues to be largely supportive and new therapeutic interventions with clinical outcome benefits are clearly needed. Nevertheless, an improving understanding of sepsis pathophysiology has created new opportunities for advances in the clinical management of patients with this syndrome. One pathophysiologic aspect that continues to be a focus of both experimental and clinical studies is the role of endotoxin in sepsis. Clinical sepsis is characterized by the episodic appearance of endotoxin in the blood and an unpredictable profile of endotoxin fragments that activate inflammatory pathways. However, therapies focused on endotoxin removal may have a beneficial impact in septic patients. The purpose of this presentation is to discuss a new membrane (Oxiris) manufactured by Gambro (Lyon, France). The substrate of the Oxiris technology is the AN69 membrane, which has unique properties allowing for the adsorptive removal of inflammatory mediators and other low-molecular proteins during conventional continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The endotoxin-removing capabilities of Oxiris are derived from the application of positively charged polymer to the AN69 base. The effective creation of a positively charged surface creates an environment favoring the removal of negatively charged endotoxin fragments during CRRT with this membrane. Moreover, this polymer application allows for the binding of heparin during the manufacturing process, resulting in a membrane with immobilized heparin. Finally, neither the polymer application nor the heparin immobilization negatively influences the inherent mediator removal capabilities of the base AN69 membrane. In fact, due to the larger surface area (1.5 m 2 ), mediator removal is enhanced relative to standard AN69 membranes used for conventional CRRT.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "Objectives: The purpose of this presentation is to discuss the experimental, animal, and clinical results reported from several studies in which the Gambro Oxiris membrane and its precursor products have been used.

In a recent large multi-center randomized placebocontrolled trial (CORTICUS) HC did not reduce mortality in patients with septic shock, regardless of their response to a corticotropin stimulation test. Moreover, in the per protocol analysis of safety endpoints, there were significant increases in the rate of hyperglycaemia, defined as glucose concentration >150 mg/dL (RR 1.18, 95% CI, 1.07-1.31). It has been hypothesized, that the increased glucose levels in the HC group may have contributed to increased mortality (2). Objectives: To determine the occurrence of hyperglycaemia (>150 mg/dL) in patients during the first week of the CORTICUS trial and its association with mortality at 28 days. Methods: Glucose values available on study days 0,1,2,3 and 7 were analyzed.

Conclusions: Sepsis is the most important challenge in intensive care medicine, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Procalcitonin levels correlate with the organ dysfunction away from the site of infection and should be used for differential diagnosis in all shock cases. Introduction: Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) is a common complication after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In the majority of cases the cystitis is BK virus (BKV) associated. The management is difficult. Many treatment options exist, but they all have a weak base of evidence, or are potentially toxic. Objectives: We report an 18-year-old adolescent with systemic mastocytoses and associated myelodysplastic syndrome. 25 days after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation the first symptoms of HC dysuria, pollakisuria and hematuria occured. BKV DNA was detectable in blood and urine. Our treatment with cidofovir, hyperhydration, estradiol and oxybutynin was not successful. The blood coagulation in the urine increased. Therefore catheterisation and bladder irrigation with 0,9% saline was initiated. After bladder tamponade urological intervention was necessary and a peridural catheter for pain management was implanted. The symptoms did not improve. Catheter coagulation, pain attacks and hematuria were still present. Bladder irriga-tion with cidofovir repeatedly over 5 days showed temporarily response 49 days after HSCT the patient developed acute GVHD of the skin and prednisolone treatment was initiated. Interesting, after the start of prednisolone we observed improving symptoms of the HC. Methods: A case report Results: HC is a possible life threatening complication and the management is difficult. Acute GVHD as a trigger of the HC was described earlier and must be discussed in this case. Conclusions: In many cases treatment options show no significant improvement. Future researches are necessary for preventive and therapeutic strategies which include the role of the acute GVHD. Introduction: Sepsis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children, accounting for 7% of all childhood deaths. In the neonatal population, sepsis is responsible for 45 % of late deaths in the neonatal intensive care unit. Objectives: Low protein C plasma levels in septic neonates have a strong positive predictive value for death. There have been several studies testing interventions with Protein C. Whereas recombinant activated protein C (aPC) showed no benefit but increased bleeding complications in septic children especially in those less than 60 days of age, plasma-derived human non-activated protein C concentrate (hPC) has been successfully used in pediatric and neonatal patients as well as in adults at high risk of hemorrhage.

Results: 4 preterms with a median birth weight of 1410 g and a gestational age of 29 weeks were assessed. Protein C activity prior to treatment was 12 %, predicting a mortality of 80 %. Predicted mortality according to NEOMOD-Score was nearly 70 %; however, all patients survived. Fast improvement of microcirculation, DIC and septic shock was observed in all patients. Purpura fulminans regressed and all patients recovered completely. No amputation of affected extremities was necessary.

Our current pathogenetic understanding is that Shiga toxins cause endothelial injury, leading to thrombotic microangiopathy . Renal failure is the predominant manifestation of the disease. The prognosis of HUS has improved in recent years due in part to peritoneal dialysis. Although the chance for recovery of renal function is generally favourable, there is still a five percent rate of mortality particularly caused by cerebral involvement. Objectives: As human protein C (PC) concentrate may anticipate thrombotic microangiopathy and facilitate fibrinolysis in this disease, we report the effects of substitution with PC in 8 patients with EHEC. Methods: 8 EHEC-positiv patients with HUS, shigatoxin 2 and severe neurological symptoms (seizures and coma) were treated with human protein C concentrate (Ceprotin, Baxter). PC was administrated in a dosage of 100-200 U/day as a bolus. Results: 7 of them suffered from a multiorgan failure. 1 patient was resuscitated as a result of a myocardial microangiopathy.The symptoms of the multiorgan failure improved rapidly and the seizure were terminated. The duration of the PC-therapy depended on persisting of clinical and chemical signs of the HUS. All patients showed signs of a disseminated intracvascular coagulation. The activity of Plasminogen-Activator-Inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and D-Dimers were significantly elevated. They rapidly decreased in the first 48 hours of the therapy especially in those patients, who showed already high levels at the beginning of the desease. A peritoneal dialysis was administered in all cases. The renal function of all patients recovered during the hospital stay. CCT were performed to detect HUS typical alterations of the brain. Conclusions: Mortality in HUS accompanied with cerebral microangiopathy is high and difficult to alter. This is the first trail of human protein C concentrate administration to anticipate thrombotic microangiopathy in HUS. All of our patients showed rapidly clinical improvement after PC administration. A significant Protein C deficiency was not existing, but all patients showed signs of a disseminated intravascular coagulation. All patients survived the severe cerebral form of the HUS. 6 of them were discharged with a restitutio ad integrum. Two girls suffered from severe neurological residues.

In 2008, the incidence amounted to 453 cases in Germany (0,55/100.000) with an overall mortality of 8%.

Methods: Since 2008 we record nationwide all cases of invasive meningococcal disease in children and adolescents by a voluntary reporting system where all children's hospitals in Germany are asked two times yearly to notify invasive cases by a case report form and to send in blood samples. Disease severity is calculated by a score based questionnaire. Host susceptibility is examined by tests for functional asplenia, defects in complement cascade (CH50, mannose binding lectine, properdine) and a screening for single nucleotide polymorphisms in molecules of the innate immune system. The reported cases are matched with those of the National Reference Centre for Meningococci (NRCM), where epidemiologic and genetic characterisation of the meningococcal isolates is performed. Spatiotemporal cluster analysis provides information about epidemiology and outbreak of hypervirulent meningococcal strains. Whole genome analysis and comparison with a definded \"meningococcal pathogenome\" investigates virulence of the specific strain. Results: Our return rate is 10% of all cases in Germany, and approximately 50% of all cases in the paediatric age group, with a matching rate of 97% for our returns with the NRCM. Severe sepsis made up 30%, 13% requiring ventilator therapy, 16% vasopressors, respectively. Overall mortality was 8.5%.

Copeptin and Mr-proANP concentrations also correlated with the first measured mean arterial pressure (MAP) after birth. The groups with a MAP of < 30mmHg, 30-34mmHg, 35-39mmHg and >40mmHg had decreasing Copeptin levels with Medians of 1270 pmol/l, 245 pmol/l, 106 pmol/l und 135 pmol/l. Analogous the Mr-proANP levels had Medians of 1110 pmol/l, 419 pmol/l, 573,5 pmol/l and 408 pmol/l. Due to the extent scatter range no significant difference could be found. No significant correlation between concentrations of Mr-proADM and MAP, GA and birthweight (BW) could be found. No significant difference could be found between healthy infants and those developing an early-onset sepsis in all three biomarkers. Conclusions: Ct-proAVP and Mr-proANP concentrations in term and preterm infants depend highly on GA and BW. Term neonates had 10 times higher and preterm neonates even 100 times higher copeptin concentrations in comparison to healthy adults. This shows the ability of term and preterm newborns to regulate their blood pressure via AVP and might be an indication that AVP is a major factor in blood pressure regulation.

The transfer was realized 8 hours after the initial admission. The patient was presented with septic multi organ failure and Purpura fulminans. ECMO was necessary because of heart failure and failure of circulation and showed no major complications. The child had wide spread dermal necrosis within the face and all extremities. Because of arterial ischemia amputation of the left leg at tibia level was necessary. This was followed by recurrent surgical debridement of necrotic tissue and constant vacuum therapy of necrotic lesions. Later on transplantation of autolog skin was performed by plastic surgery. A multidisciplinary treatment of early rehabilitation with physiotherapy (including chair of Bipedestation, mobilisation in CO2 water and ergotherapy), local treatment by Plastic Surgery and intensive care treatment by our PICU was very effective. Local pain therapy after end of systemic treatment was helpful. Results: The patient had been transferred to a neurophysiological rehabilitation hospital 3 month after admission. In a 24-month evaluation she showed excellent neurological rehabilitation, with small deficits in the area of concentration. The local findings at left leg were without any signs of infection. Problematic is still re-integration in normal school, despite of legislation for children with special needs in the normal school. Conclusions: ECMO was successful in a paediatric septic shocked patient despite of severe local infection and the need of lower leg amputation. An excellent multi disciplinary cooperation coordinated by PICU between different departments was the key of early discharge and successful rehabilitation. The outcome could have been better by fastening treatment access inside a regional paediatric intensive care network with very early implementation of treatment. Unified integrated clinical pathways from emergency department to reintegration in normal life should be designed and supervised. Centralized control of outcome by coordinated social, educational and medical services is needed. Introduction: For intensive care patients particles in infusion solutions imply a potential health risk. As part of a clinical trial (ClinicalTrials. gov; ID NCT 00209768) we assessed the exposure of particles to our patients and their inflammatory effects in vitro. Objectives: To investigate the nature of infused particles in vivo we examined the physical properties and chemical composition of particles captured by inline micro-filters used in the treatment of critically ill children. We analysed the inflammatory and cytotoxic effects of particles on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and murine macrophages (RAW 264.7) in vitro. Methods: 22 filters (Pall NOE96E/ELD96D, pore diameter 0.2\u00b5m) used in the treatment of critically ill children were analysed. Each filter was analysed by electron microscopy, and the chemical composition of random particles was determined by energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDX).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction:"}, {"text": "In the in vitro model, HUVEC and RAW 264.7 cells were incubated with different solutions of glass particles for up to 24 hours. This was conducted in the presence or absence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic severe sepsis in vivo. Levels of interleukin-1beta (IL-1\u03b2) and IL-8 were measured in the HUVEC model; IL-6 and TNF-alpha in the RAW-model (ELISA). Results: Average particle density found on the surface of a used filter membrane was 542 per cm2, compared with 48 per cm2 on the negative controls. They varied considerably in shape and size. 54% of the detected particles were between 5-15\u00b5m, whereas only 5% were above 50\u00b5m. Overall silicon was the most abundant element. When HUVEC and RAW 264.7 cells were incubated with glass particle solutions we found that cytokine levels were significantly modulated depending on time of incubation, particle load and stimulation with LPS. Secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 was significantly suppressed in the presence of glass particles; in the case of IL-6 suppression only occurred after previous stimulation with LPS. Levels of IL-8 were also suppressed after incubation with glass particles in the presence of LPS. Conclusions: Inline-filtration prevents the infusion of potentially harmful particles. Our findings confirm that micro-particles are capable of modulating cytokine secretion by endothelial cells and mac-rophages in vitro. In this way they may exert harmful effects which are beyond simple mechanical obstructions, and their immunosuppressive effect may specially deteriorate the clinical course of septic patients.

Objectives: To develop software tool that would permit early diagnosis by detecting automatically from the already existing data in the PDMS, the presence of severe sepsis or septic shock and to test its potential for early diagnosis of the condition. Methods: A tool, the Sepsis-Tool (ST), was developed which screens automatically every 8 minutes the data in PDMS and issues a warning as soon as the criteria (according to the ACCP/SCCM Consensus Conference for SIRS, one or more organ failure and/or shock) are met. The ICU staff is then immediately prompted to verify the existence of concomitant infection in order to establish a diagnosis. Consecutive Patients admitted to the ICU of university hospital were entered in the study using a prospective cohort design. The patients were permanently screened by the ST, which was followed only by a study nurse who established the diagnosis and, on the following day, compared the finding of the ST with these of the ICU physician who were left unaware of the ST warning. Results: At present, from 176 ICU patients, the ST identified 70 as SIRS, one or more organ failure and/or shock, from which only 24 were identified by the ICU staff (study nurse) as severe sepsis or septic shock.

Objectives: Is there a benefit Introduction: Critical Care is poorly developed and resourced in Malawi. Setting: The intensive care ward at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital has 4 beds for a 1000 bed hospital and admits all patients from neonates to the elderly from all specialities. The hospital has high dependency units, but these are not adequately staffed, or resourced. Results: We are battling against multiple problems. Poor infrastructure produces erratic supplies of essential drugs, limited qualified personnel and little attention of educators to the triage and optimisation of the critically ill. This leads to delays in referral and advance disease at presentation, both at referral heath centres and within the tertiary hospitals. The situation is compounded by the twin epidemics of HIV/ AIDS and road traffic accidents, with approximately 30% of our admissions being HIV positive and 30% of our workload is in the management of severe head injury. As Malawi tertiary care develops, more trained doctors are returning with an increasing vision for possible medical interventions. Such increasing sophistication inevitably requires a higher degree of support. Unfortunately critical care is perceived as a luxury that cannot be afforded in a poor country, and as a consequence the country's investment in new specialists will never be fully realised. Due to delays in patients seeking treatment and referrals, we perform many laparotomies on sick patients. If ventilation is not available due to the limitations outlined above, patients usually miss out on critical care. We are convinced that many patients die as a direct consequence of inadequate fluid monitoring post-operatively on over-stretched wards. Due to lack of resources ICU outreach is not a realistic possibility, so alternative solutions must be found. Resource utilisation is a challenge worldwide, not just in Africa, although clearly more pronounced here. Conclusions: Several new technologies have been developed to stratify and optimise care for sick patients,one of which is the oesophageal Doppler. We validated a protocol for intra-operative fluid replacement guided by the oesophageal Doppler, due to its non-invasiveness and ease of use. This approach has been shown to reduce mortality in the elderly population in Europe following a fractured neck of femur. We will establish whether we can reduce mortality of similar high risk patients denied critical care in the African setting. We believe this will be the first such study undertaken in such a resource poor country.

Twenty hours after CLP the anaesthetised rats were decapitated, hearts were immediately excised and transferred to the Langendorff apparatus. TRT (time of attachment to removal of an adhesive 10-mm by 12-mm tape on both front paws) was assessed before CLP and decapitation.

CRP and complement form the first defence line of innate immunity and play an important role in the non-inflammatory clearance of apoptotic and necrotic cells. Because CRP activates complement, the recruitment of regulators like Factor H is crucial to prevent uncontrolled inflammatory conditions. Objectives: The study characterizes which of the two CRP variants, the monomeric or pentameric form, binds to damaged cells and interacts with Factor H. Furthermore we analyzed whether CRP by recruiting Factor H generates an anti-inflammatory scenario which blocks production of inflammatory mediators by macrophages and influences phagocytosis of damaged cells and cellular debris. Methods: Protein interaction was analyzed using recombinant CRP, purified Factor H, and Factor H deletion fragments in ELISA and Surface Plasmon Resonance analysis. Binding to intact, apoptotic and necrotic human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was assayed by Flow cytometry. To determine whether CRP-Factor H complexes modulate the clearance of damaged cells, complement inactivation, the uptake of apoptotic HUVEC particles, and the cytokine release of macrophages was assayed. Results: A calcium independent binding of monomeric CRP (mCRP), but not of pentameric CRP (pCRP) to Factor H to was shown. In addition to the two known CRP binding sites of Factor H, a novel third site was localized within the central C-terminal cell surface recognition region of the protein. mCRP directs Factor H to the surface of apoptotic and necrotic cells and we identify phopshocholine as binding moiety for this complex. mCRP Factor H complexes enhance inactivation of the central complement component C3b both in fluid phase and on the surface of damaged cells, thus generate and antiinflammatory scenario, increase phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines. Conclusions: By recruiting the soluble complement inhibitor Factor H to the surface of damaged endothelial cells, mCRP generates an antiinflammatory scenario. The mCRP Factor H complex blocks progression of the complement cascade beyond the step of the C3 convertase, prevents release of inflammatory cytokines and thus induces the safe and anti-inflammatory removal of opsonized apoptotic cell particles.

Introduction: Directed migration and ROS release are crucial elements of neutrophil capacity against microorganisms Objectives: Though the outstanding role of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) in acute inflammatory processes has become increasingly apparent, there is a marked lack of clinically practicable tests of PMNs function. The available methods are work, time and cost intensive, require large quantities of blood and are unsuitable for routine clinical use. We present alternative, highly automated methods for measuring blood PMN migration and reactive oxygen (ROS) release, that are simple, fast and reliable. Methods: Fresh whole blood, processed within one hour after puncture, is used. PMN migration is measured in a one-way ready-to-use membrane filter assay containing the chemoattractant F-Met-Leu-Phe (FMLP) in solid form. Tests are made in triplicate; a complete test unit comprises 3 test and 3 blank wells (controls). A whole test requires 36 \u00b5L fresh whole blood diluted with 1:5 salt solution; 30 \u00b5L of diluted blood is pipetted into each well.Incubation time is 15 minutes at 37\u00b0C. FMLP dissolves in the blood suspension, the PMNs follow the gradient and penetrate into the filters. After staining, an automated image analyser measures numbers and distribution of immigrant PMNs throughout the whole depth of a filter. The measurement can be done within one hour. Phorbolester (PMA)-stimulated ROS release is measured on-line by luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence in a fully automated luminometer at 37\u00b0C. Test material and blank controls are examined in duplicate; the whole test requires 30 minutes and 4 \u00b5L blood.Results: The use of whole blood avoids loss of material by cell separation, speeds processing and saves labor and costs. Moreover, as a crucial point, the sensitive PMN reactivity (priming) is largely preserved. Conclusions: Automation makes measurement of PMN functions easy and independant of individual biases.

Objectives: Prospective assessment of pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic parameters, and microbiological eradication after the continuous infusion of piperacillin/tazobactam in ICU patients with ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). Methods: VAP was defined according to CDC definition and /or CPIS (> 6). A mini-BAL method was used for examination of respiratory tract secretion. E-tests for oxacillin, piperacilin/tazobactam, imipenem, amikacin and ceftazidim were applied directly on samples. Total serum piperacillin level was determined by HPLC before the infusion and after 1,6,12,24,48,72 h. Piperacillin/tazobactam was administered by bolus of 2,0/0,25g/30 min, followed by continuous infusion of 11,25 g/23h 30min. According to pharmacokinetic modeling, the DD was reduced by 2,25g on day 2. Microbiological responses were assessed as follows: eradication, colonization, exogenous colonization, and new infection.Results: 16 patients with VAP were enrolled to the study (SOFA 8,1, APACHE II 24,5, CPIS 8,2).

Several clinical studiesInfection 37 \u00b7 2009 \u00b7 Supplement III \u00a9 URBAN & VOGEL suggests that this kind of modeling can be particularly useful during continuous infusion of beta-lactam antibiotics in critically ill patients, with positive therapeutic as well as pharmacoeconomic results. Objectives: Assessment of clinical effect after modification of adjusted day dose (DD) of piperacillin/tazobactam (PIP/TAZ) in continuous infusion, according to PK/PD parameters during VAP treatment. Methods: VAP was diagnosed using clinical CDC definition and CPIS score values over 6 points. For microbiological diagnosis, samples from lower respiratory tract were obtained by mini-BAL method and E-tests were applied directly on the samples. Total concentration of serum piperacillin (protein bound fraction) was determined by HPLC before the infusion and after1,6,12,24,48,72 h of treatment. Bolus dose of PIP/TAZ (2,0/0,25g in 30 min) was followed by continuous daily infusion of 11,25g. DD was reduced or enlarged by 2,25g according to PK/PD modeling at the second day of treatment. The standard maximal DD (18,0g) was not exceeded. The aim of modeling was to maintain serum piperacillin concentration 4x above the MIC of the pathogen for at least 70% of time when pathogen was Gram positive and about 100% of time when pathogen was Gram negative. Results: 16 patients with VAP were included to the study. The mean value of APACHE II was 24,5, and SOFA score was 8,1 at the day of ICU admission. The mean value of DD was 11,1g; TD 96,0g, DD/kg body weight 169,8mg. Mean time of treatment was 8,5 days. 12 (75%) of patients were cured, 4 (25%) patients died. The maximal DD of PIP/TAZ was 18,0g, and the real DD was reduced by 39% to 11,0g. The maximal TD(total dose) of PIP/TAZ was 180,0g, the real TD was reduced by 45% to 99,0g. The expected daily cost of 10 days of standard treatment with the maximal DD was 200 \u20ac while the real cost was 122 \u20ac (39% reduction of costs). The expected total cost of 10 days of standard treatment with the maximal dose of PIP/TAZ was 2000,0 \u20ac while the real cost was reduced by 45% to 1100,0 \u20ac (the mean cost of 4,5g Piperacillin /Tazobactam in EU = 50 \u20ac).

Methods: Review of data from the SepNet cross-sectional 1-day pointprevalence study of patients with sepsis by on-site visit and 3 month follow-up. 1 ICU directors were asked about their fluid preferences. SPSS 15.0.1 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used; Chi-square test or Kruskal-Wallis H-test were applied where appropriate. Results: Stated and actual fluid use did not differ by hospital size.

It is mainly used to treat infections such as moderate to severe intra-abdominal infections, gynecologic infections, and skin and soft-tissue infection caused by susceptible organisms. In individuals with normal renal function approximately 85% of both, ampicillin and sulbactam are excreted unchanged in the urine with an elimination half-life of both ampicillin and sulbactam of approximately 1 hour. Concomitant with the decline in renal function the terminal elimination half-life increases up to 24 hours in patients with end-stage renal disease. Although Unacid \u00ae is frequently used in patients on dialysis the world literature consists of pharmacokinetic (PK) data on FOUR chronic hemodialysis patients. There are no reported PK data in patients undergoing extended dialysis (ED). Methods: We determined single dose pharmacokinetics of ampicillin/sulbactam in five patients with acute renal failure undergoing ED. Blood samples were taken at regualr intervals after start of infusion through an indwelling venous cannula. ED over a period of 8.0 h was performed using the GENIUS \u00ae batch dialysis system (Fresenius Medical Care, Germany) with a polysulphone high-flux dialyser (F60S, surface area 1.3 m 2 ; Fresenius Medical Care). Ampicillin and Sulbactam concentrations were determined by a validated LC-MS method. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by non-compartmental methods using WinNonlin software program (WinNonlin version 3.1, Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, Ca, USA). Results: After a single dose of 3 g, the average elimination half-life of Unacid \u00ae was 1.9 hrs.The dialyzer clearance was 115.7 ml/min. Conclusions: Our data suggest that, in order to achieve adequate plasma drug levels, Unacid \u00ae should be administered twice daily (3 g) in critically ill patients undergoing ED.

The mortality rate is 16.7% and deaths are mostly caused by profound sepsis. The initial leakage of endogenous gastrointestinal microflora into the peritoneal cavity results in peritonitis and secondary septicemia which often results in a localized intraabdominal abscess (IA). Objectives: We report a case in which the patient was wrongly diagnosed and SIRS came into existance. Methods: 15 year old female patient presented at the village clinic with symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal discomfort. She was diagnosed with gastroenteritis and was told to take analgesic drugs. At the end of 7th day, she returned to the same clinic. She was dispatched to the emergency clinic of Central Hospital. Because the abdominal distention, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea and weight loss did not regress, she was consulted by general surgery on the 3rd day. Her Glasgow Coma Scale was 9, temperature 39,8, heart rate 150/min, arterial blood pressure 60/30 mmHg, dry and crusty oral mucosa, respiratory rate 40/min and white blood cell was 31,7. She was scheduled for urgent surgery under the prediagnosis of mechanical intestinal obstruction by malignant tumour. During exploration, edematous intestines with patchy cohesivenesses were observed. 2000 cc of purulent volume was aspired from the abdominal cavity. As median perforation of appendicitis was determined, appendectomy was completed. She was transfered to ICU with the diagnosis of postoperative SIRS . Results: She was on oxygen support. Treatments were started for acidosis, electrolight disorder, antibiotherapy, fluid replacement and parenteral nutrition . On the third postoperative day she needed noninvasive mechanical ventilation. Radiological findings were normal on the 4th day, she improved dramatically in the following days.At the end of 6th day, the patient was discharged from ICU. Conclusions: A significant number of complications in AA develop due to delayed or missed diagnosis. The importance of complex therapy, surgical and intensive care, and collaboration between surgeons and anesthesiologists should be considered.

Blood cultures (BC) are advised for the identification of pathogens prior to initiation of antibiotic treatment. The major drawbacks of BC are high rates of false negative results due to inappropriate growth conditions or growth inhibition due to antibiotic treatment and the long time-to-result for detection and identification. Molecular methods including PCR are being discussed as promising tools for the rapid detection of pathogens. Objectives: The objective of this case report was to compare a new PCR approach with standard blood culture in the detection and monitoring of a blood stream infection after initiation of antibiotic treatment. Methods: A patient with a multiple myeloma is reported in whom several repetitive blood cultures were drawn after initiation of levofloxacin therapy while in parallel universal 16S rDNA Real-Time PCR was applied using a new test, SepsiTest\u2122 (Molzym, Bremen). Results: There was a shift to later Real-Time PCR cycles of positivity, i.e. a lower concentration of Staphylococcus epidermidis DNA in the sample. Thus, adequate antibiotic treatment measured by PCR over time corresponded to BC testing results. Conclusions: This case demonstrates that the new PCR test, SepsiT-est\u2122, is able to correctly diagnose bacterial blood stream infection.

The standard blood culture (BC) takes several days to obtain results and has low sensitivity. Slow growing and fastidious pathogens can delay the diagnosis and subsequent treatment. Objectives: We describe a diagnosis of Candida parapsilosis bloodstream infection by standard BC method and by the PCR-based Light-Cycler Septifast test. Methods: Infection pathogens in blood were detected in blood samples by Real-time PCR (LightCycler SeptiFast Test, Roche Diagnostics) method and by a standard BC method (BacT/Alert 3D, Becton Dickinson). Blood for analysis was drew from the patient (male, 33 years old) 4 times: suspected bloodstream infection (sample1), and then after 4 days (sample 2), two weeks (sample 3) and 5 weeks (sample 4) to control the effectiveness of treatment. Additional patient specimens (BAL, urine, drainage fluid) were analyzed by conventional culture method at the same time. Results: The main reason for ICU admission was imminent acute postoperative respiratory failure after abdominal surgery (pancreatitis). Patient s status at the admission was as follow: APACHE II = 7 and SOFA = 2. In the course of treatment patient developed severe sepsis and then MODS, and at the entry to the study APACHE II was 19 and SOFA was 6. Out of overall 4 blood tests, all were positive by RT-PCR method. Candida parapsilosis and Serratia marcescens were detected in sample 1 by SeptiFast but not by BC method. In sample 2 Serratia marcescens was detected by both methods (APACHE II score =13, SOFA score = 2). Patient s condition deteriorated in the course of treatment, Candida parapsilosis and Serratia marcescens were detected in blood sample 3 by SeptiFast but not by BC method (APACHE II =17, SOFA = 10). Serratia marcescens was detected by SeptiFast but not by BC method in sample 4 (APACHE II =11, SOFA = 1). Additional microbiological data of other specimens supported RT-PCR blood results. Conclusions: RT-PCR results induced therapeutic consequences; earlier pathogen detection had the potential to facilitate early evidencebased treatment. The results of SeptiFast test supported by clinical signs of infection and by positive culture results of additional patient's specimens led to change of empiric to directed treatment.

We describe a case of extraintestinal hepatic pinworm abscess associated with a severe hepatic failure and a severe septic shock . A brief review of the literature is given and possible mechanisms of tissue invasion are discussed. Haematogenous spread and direct penetration of the liver preceded by either invasion of the peritoneum through unhealthy or traumatized intestinal tissue, or from migration up the genital tract are the infective mechanisms considered. Objectives: We report the case of an hepatic pinworm granuloma, localised in the right hepatic lobe of an elderly male diabetic immunocompetent subject, nowadays dead. The patient is admitted for septic shock and severe hepatic failure, and a right hepatectomy is done. The anatomo-pathological examination put in obviousness a parasitic granuloma and presence of eggs of Enterobius vermicularis. In the present case direct passage of the nematode through damaged intestinal tissue seems unlikely and no embolism in portal vein was demonstrable. Key words: hepatic pinworm granuloma, severe hepatic failure. Methods: A case report Results: Diagnosis and Observations: A 67 years old male, with several pathological antecedents (COPD, hypertensive cardiopathy, ischemic stroke, epilepsy) is admitted in ICU for septic shock and severe hepatic failure. The CT to Scan shows a right hepatic liquid mass of 10 cms of main line, in contents multiple subdivisions. The MRI showed within the right hepatic lobe the presence of the voluminous cystic heterogeneous lesion about 14 cms of main line. After collective discussion a right hepatectomy is proposed by respecting the segment 7 to guarantee a hepatic function. The suppuration state of the right lobe required a right complete hepatectomy. The anatomo-pathological examination put in obviousness a parasitic granuloma and presence of eggs of Enterobius vermicularis. An antihelmintic albendazole treatment was started. No other site of infestation was found. Unfortunately the patient dies within the month of a respiratory sepsis with an important degradation of his hepatic function. Conclusions: Granulomas are focal accumulation of modified macrophages. They are thought to form when macrophages ingest poorly soluble antigens. These can be viral, bacterial, fungal, parasitic or unrelated to infection or infestation; sarcoidosis and tuberculosis are high on the list in many series. Enterobius vermicularis (syn. Oxyurus vermicularis), also known as pinworm or seatworm, is the causative agent of human enterobiasis (oxyuriasis). The disease is more prevalent in temperate regions and is facilitated by factors such as overcrowding in schools and family groupings, as well as inadequate personal and community hygiene. In the great majority of cases, enterobiasis is asymptomatic. One common symptom is intense pruritis ani that in some patients can lead to insomnia, restlessness and irritability. Scratching may cause skin irritation, and in more serious cases, eczematous dermatitis, haemorrhage or secondary bacterial infections. Ectopic migration of E. vermicularis often results in pinworm infestation of the female genital tract often causing granulomas of the uterus, ovary and the fallopian tubes and pelvic peritoneum. Enterobius vermicularis ('pinworm') is extremely rarely found outside the gastro-intestinal tract especially in males. Far fewer peritoneal pinworm lesions have been found in males due to the lack of a convenient entry site. Peritoneal lesions in males have been attributed to penetration through unhealthy intestinal mucosa (ulcerations, tumors) . Less understood is the migratory route of pinworms found in peritoneal organs (liver, ovary, kidney, spleen) because buccal apparatus of Enterobius is unsuitable for invasion of healthy tissues. Therefore, several invasive routes have been suggested: for ovary -penetration through ruptured graafian follicles (Beckman & Holland), for kidney -by ascending the urinary tract (Symmers), for liver -haematogenous spread (Little & al) . Slais reported a case of hepatic granuloma with embolism in portal vein. Multiple intraperitoneal granulomas were discovered in a 31-year-old woman after surgical excision for a perforated appendix. A case of omental enterobiosis was reported by Reyes and colleagues in a 62-year-old woman after ruptured sigmoid diverticulitis. However, in the present case no colonic tumor or perforation was demonstrable. Therefore, direct passage of the nematode through damaged intestinal tissue seems unlikely. Introduction: Organ scarcity in Germany is still present and leadsbecause of raising waiting lists-to acceptance of marginal organs. It is not possible anymore to reject organs from elder patients, with elevated parameters or infections; the borders are marcerated. We want to introduce and follow a case of organ donation from a septic donor. Objectives: A 43-year old man came to the emergency room with a femoral abscess. It was opened and a grave impairement of the infectional siuation followed: He suffered a cardial arrest and reanimation for 5 minutes and complicating aspiration. This situation led finally to brain death and organ donation. Methods: At the time of operation a moderate catecholamine therapy was necessary: norepinphrine 0,10 \u00b5g/kg /min, dobutamine 1,96\u00b5g/kg/ min. Antibiotical therapy was initially metronidazol 1 g/day and ceftriaxon 2 g/day, after 6 days it was adjusted in flucloxacillin 6 g/day, clindamycine 1,8 g/day and meropenem 1,8 g/day according to antibiogramm. Results: In the initial femoral scrape test grampositive diploccae were found. After aspiration, bronchial lavage showed Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and a multiresistent SA. In blood culture no bacteria were found during antibiotic therapy. White blood cells rose from 21 Gpt/l to 41 Gpt/lin 1 week, CRP was elevated during the whole stay (286 to 216 mg/l). Finally only the kidneys were allocated; heart, lungs and liver were excluded for medical reasons. Both kidneys were transplanted, during the operations no complications occurred. Under standard antibiotic therapy (ceftriaxon and sulfamethoxacole / trimethoprime) there was no incidence of any infection. Kidney function was appropriate and patients could be discharged in time. Conclusions: In times of organ scarcity marginal organs cannot be refused. Though infectious problems and septic clinical picture with Staphylococcus aureus and MRSA, an organ transplantation was possible. With targeted monitoring also a standard antibiotic therapy was sufficent. So this case shows that also marginal organs can be transplanted successfully, if there is an experienced center with well-rehearsed settings. An organ transplantation is possible without endangering the recipient.

In 2003 we founded a pediatric intensive care network with 26 childrenhospitals (PIN). The primary aims of the network were the standardisation of clinical therapies, implementation of certified training programs and the installation of an emergency system in the region. Objectives: The first project was the implementation of a common sepsis bundle. The coordination center was the tertiary children hospital of the Medical University School of Hannover. Methods: The different parts of the sepsis bundle are described in the following : (i) Task force: A workgroup with participation of all hospitals was established. The task force comprised of the majority of the chief pediatric intensivists from the different clinics. They discussed and decided the therapy algorithm and operated as the primary contact person and multiplier of the task force decisions. (ii) Symposium: The implementation of the sepsis bundle started with a central symposium. The symposium informed of pathopysiology, epidemiology, therapy and prevention of pediatric sepsis. The symposium was supported by members of the german sepsis society and the german society of pediatric infectiology. (iii) Local lectures and instructions of the decided therapy strategies were followed. The university childrens hospital provided continuous pediatric intensive care workshops for sepsis therapy and diagnostic, management of circulation and organ failure as soon as instructions in technical skills. The university childrens hospital of Hannover offered a 24 h emergency and transportation support. If necessary, the team of the tertiary center assisted in the therapy in the primary clinic till the patient was out of danger or they transfered the child in the university hospital for further treatment. The PIN established a 24 h consultation service with experienced specialists of the university pediatric intensive care center. All cases were registrated at the university hospital.Therapy and Outcome were analysed. Results: In the first 6 years 31 cases of patients with septic shock were registrated in the network. 26 patients were treated with the support of the sepsis emergency team or the consultation service. 24 Patients were transferred to the university hospital. 26 children survived with Restitutio ad integrum. 2 Patients had skin necrosis or amputation and 3 died. One child died directly after admission in the primary hospital. In the other cases with complications, the gap of the recruitment in the network was too long. After the initial training period, the sepsis bundle worked very effective. Conclusions: Every child with immediatly support of the task force survived in good conditions. A time delay of patient recruitment in the network treatment seems to be a negativ prognostic factor. As a result of the optimized algorithm the medical costs could be reduced significantly.

Phosphodiesterase (PDE) -Inhibitors were used to ameliorate the reduction in deformability when the PMN were stimulated with fMLP or IL-8: Enoximone, Milrinone (PDE-III inhibitors), Pentoxifylline and Piclamilast (PDE-IV inhibitors).

Phagocytosis and intracellular degradation of bacteria by monocytes are early events in pathogen-host interaction, resulting in pro-inflammatory activation. Phagocytosis induced cell death (PICD) and clearance of apoptotic cells, e.g. neutrophils are essential for resolution of inflammation. Autopsies of neonatal, pediatric and adult septic patients revealed extensive apoptosis of lymphocytes and dendritic cells. An imbalance between host cell survival survival and apoptosis would either lead to immune paralysis due to effector cell loss or to an exaggerated, prolonged inflammatory reaction. Monocyte PICD may play a role in limiting inflammatory reactions and tissue destruction.

Post-phagocytic reactions of CBMO differed significantly to PBMO with respect to a stronger and more sustained IL-8 response and the capability to stimulate other immune cells, e.g. T cells with a polyclonal T cell mitogen.

With implementation of the SOP, use of volume in the first 6 hours (1506 vs. 2154 ml p<0,05) and in the first day (4005 vs. 6122 ml p<0,001) significantly increased. Furthermore, treatment with hydrocortisone, selenium and insuline increased after implementation of the SOP significantly. Catecholamines and rhAPC were unaffected. Most outstanding fact was the singificant descenting of mortality between the groups, from 57% (without SOP) to 38,5% in the intervention group with SOP (p < 0,05). Conclusions: Due to the implementation of a standard algorithm significant increase in volume therapy and adjunctive sepsis therapy were realised more frequent compared to patients treated without standard operating procedure and could be associated with a lower mortality rate in patients. The realisation of an evidence based standard operating procedure in daily practice in patients with severe sepsis and/or septic shock is effective, shown in alteration of treatment practice and especially the reduction of mortality. Introduction: Since the 1960s invasive infections by encapsulated bacteria have been recognized as a serious complication in patients with anatomical or functional asplenia. However, earlier studies have critical limitations, and evidence regarding pathogenesis, incidence and outcome of overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI) is insufficient. Objectives: We made attempts to assess the current epidemiology of infectious complications after splenectomy in Germany. Methods: Incidence and prevalence of asplenia and infections after splenectomy where searched in MEDLINE. The annual rate of splenectomy in Germany was calculated from DRG statistics. Databases for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) of the national reference center for streptococci (NRZ Aachen) and for pediatric invasive meningococcal infections (Meningokokken-Netz, Freiburg) were searched for asplenia as underlying disease. Results: According to DRG statistics, 8012 splenectomies were performed in Germany in 2007. The prevalence of asplenia in Germany is unknown, but it was estimated ~9 -10 per 10.000 population in the United Kingdom. Assuming similar frequencies, we estimate the prevalence of anatomical asplenia to be ~80.000 persons in Germany and this number does not even take patients with functional hyposplenia into account. Thus, asplenia is a frequent immunodeficiency. Earlier studies estimated the annual risk for OPSI to be in the range 0,25% -0,45%. Under these assumptions we can expect > 200 to 360 OPSI cases per year in Germany resulting in > 100 to 180 deaths due to septic shock. Studies published in the literature consistently report pneumococci as the number one pathogen in OPSI, accounting for 50 to 80% of the cases, while the role of meningococci in OPSI has remained controversial. Surprisingly few cases of pneumococcal OPSI (11 cases of more than 15.000 isolates in IPD between 1996 to 2009), however, are being reported to the NRZ Aachen. On the other hand, 5 of 46 (11%) of cases of meningococcal sepsis in children in the context of hypo-or asplenia were recorded in Meningokokken-Netz since 2007. Conclusions: Asplenia is a common but underrecognized immunodeficiency in Germany. The rates of pneumococcal and meningococcal OPSI notified in Germany are in poor agreement with the frequencies found in retrospective studies. We believe there is an urgent need for prospective analysis of asplenia as a risk factor for septic shock and invasive pneumococcal and meningococcal disease. (1), Studart FS (1) Introduction: In the USA more than a quarter of hospital pharmacists work as ward pharmacists. Many studies there have shown that pharmaceutical care has a positive influence on the quality of drug therapy. In Germany this concept has so far not been considered to the same extent, because it is not as well known there how much influence pharmaceutical interventions exert on the quality of pharmacotherapy in the German setting. Objectives: To determine the kind of pharmaceutical interventions for the improvement of drug therapy. Methods: For the period of March 1 to March 31, 2008, all clinical pharmaceutical interventions in an intensive care unit with 26 beds were documented and classified. During the time examined, a total of 153 patients were attended to. The interventions took place following an examination of the electronic patient records. Therefore, the pharmacist had access not only to the entire medication, but also to all laboratory and patient data.

In this way the work of a clinical pharmacist represents an important contribution toward ensuring the quality of pharmacotherapy.
