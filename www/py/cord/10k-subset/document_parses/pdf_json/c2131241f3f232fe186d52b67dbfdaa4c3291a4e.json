Surveillance of tuberculosis at the slaughterhouse in small ruminants should be improved and encouraged, as this is in practice the only surveillance system available.

For biological hazards the ranking was based on the magnitude of the human health impact, the severity of the disease in humans and the evidence supporting the role of meat from sheep and goats as a risk factor for disease in humans. The assessment was focused on the public health risks that may occur through the handling, preparation for consumption and/or consumption of meat from these species. The term 'priority' was considered more appropriate than 'risk' for categorizing the biological hazards associated with meat from small ruminants, given that a significant amount of data on both the occurrence of the hazards and on the attributable fraction of human cases to meat from small ruminants were not available. Risk ranking of chemical hazards into categories of potential concern was based on the outcomes of the national residue control plans (NRCPs), as defined in Council Directive 96/23/EC for the period 2005-2010, and of other testing programmes, as well as on substance-specific parameters such as the toxicological profile and the likelihood of the occurrence of residues and contaminants in sheep and goats.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SUMMARY"}, {"text": "Based on the ranking for biological hazards, Toxoplasma gondii and pathogenic verocytotoxinproducing Escherichia coli (VTEC) were classified as high priority for public health regarding meat inspection of small ruminants.

For chemical hazards, dioxins and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs) were ranked as being of high potential concern owing to their known bioaccumulation in the food chain, their frequent findings above maximum levels (MLs), particularly in sheep liver, and in consideration of their toxicological profile; all other substances were ranked as of medium or lower concern.

The assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the current meat inspection was based on its contribution to the control of the meat-borne human health hazards identified in sheep and goats. A number of strengths and weaknesses of the current inspection system were identified. Currently, the use of FCI for food safety purposes is limited for small ruminants because the data that it contains is very general and doesn't address specific hazards of public health importance. However, FCI could serve as a valuable tool for risk management decisions and could be used for risk categorisation of farms or batches of animals. To achieve this, the system needs further development to include additional information important for food safety, including definition of appropriate and standardized indicators for the main public health hazards identified above. Ante-mortem and post-mortem inspections of sheep and goats enable the detection of observable abnormalities and provide a general assessment of animal/herd health, which if compromised may lead to a greater public health risk.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SUMMARY"}, {"text": "Visual inspection of live animals and carcasses can detect animals heavily contaminated with faeces, which increase the risk for cross-contamination during slaughter and may constitute a food safety risk if the animals are carrying hazards of public health importance. If such animals or carcasses are dealt with adequately, this risk can be reduced. Visual detection of faecal contamination on carcasses can also be an indicator of slaughter hygiene, but other approaches to verify this should be considered. Post-mortem inspection can also detect non meat-borne hazards of public health significance, such as Echinococcus granulosus, that can be present in carcasses or offal from small ruminants. Ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection also have the potential to detect new diseases, which may be of direct public health significance. With regard to chemical hazards, it was noted that current procedures for sampling and testing are, in general, well established and coordinated, including follow-up actions subsequent to the identification of non-compliant samples. The regular sampling and testing for chemical residues and contaminants is an important disincentive for the development of undesirable practices and the prescriptive sampling system allows for equivalence in the control of EU-produced sheep and goat meat. The current combination of animal traceability, ante-mortem inspection and gross tissue examination can support the collection of appropriate samples for residue monitoring.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SUMMARY"}, {"text": "The main weakness of ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection is that they are not able to detect any of the public health hazards identified as the main concerns for food safety. In addition, given that the current post-mortem procedures involve palpation and incision of some organs, the potential for crosscontamination of carcasses exists. For chemical hazards, a major weakness is that, with very few exceptions, presence of chemical hazards cannot be identified by current ante-/post-mortem meat inspection procedures at the slaughterhouse level and there is a lack of sufficient cost-effective and reliable screening methods. In addition, sampling is mostly prescriptive rather than risk or information based. There is limited ongoing adaptation of the sampling and testing programmes to the results of the residue monitoring programmes, with poor integration between the testing of feed materials for undesirable substances and the NRCPs and sampling under the NRCPs reflecting only a part of testing done by a number of MSs, the results of which should be taken into consideration.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SUMMARY"}, {"text": "As neither of the main public health hazards associated with meat from small ruminants can be detected by traditional visual meat inspection, other approaches are necessary to identify and control these microbiological hazards.

Goats are generally reared in extensive systems, traditionally in less developed areas, such as mountains or arid regions, and are often reared with sheep, especially in southern Europe. Milk sheep and goats are reared in similar systems, either grazed near the farm or kept housed, with the milk used in most cases for cheese production. Meat production in Europe reflects the diverse farming systems. Lamb 9 meat production originates from sheep milk farms or from farms raising meat breeds. In the Mediterranean countries, the lambs from milk farms are slaughtered at approximately one month of age (suckling lambs, the same applies to goat kids). In some of these countries, lambs from meat breeds are generally slaughtered at 70-100 days of age and represent the majority of total national lamb meat production. In northern countries, the rearing systems usually produce heavier lambs that may be slaughtered at six or more months of age.

As a result, sheep meat is relatively expensive in the market compared with other protein sources. The co-products (e.g. hides, wool, offal, feet, tails, etc.) have a major effect on the prices received by producers, and the impact on the profitability of the enterprise is profound (Byrne et al., 2011) . EUROSTAT statistics show that sheep meat production in the EU was over 720 000 tonnes in 2011, with the United Kingdom and Spain as the greatest producers ( Figure 1 ). Goat meat production in the EU is concentrated in the southern European countries, especially Greece and Spain ( There are many forces instigating change in sheep and goat meat production. Legislative forces present in the hygiene package and microbiological regulation have increased meat hygiene service costs through structural and food safety requirements as well as mandating the provision of traceability and food chain information (Palmer C.M., 2008) . Commercial considerations, such as lower coproduct returns, higher costs of by-product disposal and the sourcing policies of the multiple retailers (using their market power to control margins) have also put pressure on slaughterhouse profitability (Palmer, 2008) . In spite of the EU being only about 80 % self-sufficient in sheep meat, the predictions are that EU sheep numbers are expected to continue to decline over the next 10 years. This problem of falling sheep supplies has led to an overcapacity in the processing sector (Byrne et al., 2011) . The effect of this decline is most acute for large slaughterhouses, which can only be run profitably at certain levels of throughput. Given the energy market expectations, greater environmental controls and the pressure on enforcement costs, relief from falling costs looks unlikely (Palmer, 2008) . , 1999) .

Although Salmonella spp. is commonly found in live sheep or goats at variable prevalence levels (Bonke et al., 2012; Duffy et al., 2009; Duffy et al., 2010; Hjartardottir et al., 2002; Moriarty et al., 2011; Zweifel et al., 2004) , there is a more limited number of studies looking at the occurrence of Salmonella spp. in sheep and goats carcasses. A prevalence of 0. 3% was reported in individual sheep carcasses in the EU monitoring (see Table 5 ). Some outbreaks linked to meat from small ruminants can be found in the scientific literature (Evans et al., 1999; Hess et al., 2008; Synnott et al., 1993) . These involved unusual consumption patterns (e.g. raw lamb liver) or cross-contamination of raw food ingredients (e.g. yoghurt relish contaminated with carcass blood), therefore it is unclear how significant these events are when assessing the role of sheep or goat meat as a source of Salmonella spp. infection. Data from epidemiological or source attribution studies suggest that the role of meat from small ruminants as a vehicle for Salmonella spp. The occurrence of antimicrobial resistance among zoonotic Salmonella spp. is an increasing problem. Antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella spp. involved in human disease are, like Salmonella spp. in general, mostly spread through foods, predominantly poultry meat, eggs, pork and beef (Hald et al., 2007) . As there are no indications that resistant strains behave differently from their sensitive counterparts in the food chain, there is no need to consider these strains separately in the context of meat inspection. Fluoroquinolone and cephalosporin resistance are currently considered to be those of most public health concern. Meat, particularly poultry meat and pork, is recognised as an important source of human exposure to fluoroquinolone-resistant Salmonella spp., and high levels of ESBL-/AmpC-producing Salmonella spp. have also been reported in poultry in some EU MSs (EFSA and ECDC, 2013a). Such resistant strains may or may not be associated with a significant level of human infection, depending on the pathogenicity of the strains involved and the opportunity for them to contaminate the food chain (Butaye et al., 2006; de Jong et al., 2012; EFSA Panel on Biological Hazards, 2011c; Rodriguez et al., 2012) .

Although antibodies are found in 20-40 % of adults in the United Kingdom, seroprevalence is higher in Central Europe, and similar or lower in Scandinavia (11-28 %). Climate and consumption of raw meat, meat from animals farmed outdoors or frozen meat may be factors that contribute to these variations (Kijlstra and Jongert, 2008) .

Sometimes, cysts of T. gondii can be macroscopically visible but it is impossible to distinguish them from Sarcocystis cysts, except cysts of S. ovifelis. Visible meat quality-related abnormalities are detectable at post-mortem inspection, but these are not important for human health (see Table 8 ). Sometimes, septicaemia and conditions associated with foci of infection in tissue such as arthritis, bronchopneumonia, mastitis, pleuritis or abscesses can be detectable at post-mortem inspection. Some of these are caused by pathogens that might have zoonotic implications (e.g. Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, S. aureus), but, as explained in Section 2 of this Appendix, the risk to public health arising from these hazards is not considered to be important and is mostly related to occupational exposure or the way the meat is handled after it leaves the slaughterhouse. Other conditions that result in condemnation of offal or carcasses are parasitic lesions. These parasites (C. tenuicollis, Sarcocystis, Fasciola, Dicrocoelium, etc.) are not transmissible via meat consumption. In cases where these abnormalities are observed, the meat must be removed as unfit for human consumption on aesthetic or meat quality grounds. The potential for cross-contamination of carcasses exists whenever palpation and/or incision methods are used in the inspection process. Palpation of the liver, the lungs, the umbilical region and the joints, and the incision of the gastric surface of the liver during the post-mortem examination of sheep and goats could contribute to the spread of the bacterial hazards of public health importance in small ruminants through cross-contamination. The importance of cross-contamination is not clear in small ruminants, although it has been considered important in other species (Walker et al., 2000) .

A continuous input of sporulated oocysts, originating from young infected cats, must be present to sustain the oocyst reservoir in the environment (Kijlstra and Jongert, 2008). The risk of environmental oocyst contamination can be addressed by using sterilised feed and bedding, and not allowing sheep and goats outdoor access; however, such husbandry practices are not economically viable in most EU commercial sheep and goat enterprises (Kijlstra and Jongert, 2009). Removing cats from the farm surroundings, or vaccinating cats, could theoretically lead to a reduction of the oocyst load in the neighbourhood of the farm.

However, a more practical solution is taking a blood sample during bleeding of the animal at the slaughterhouse, or even freezing a piece of meat and collecting the meat juice during thawing. Studies have indicated regional differences in seroprevalence in small ruminants which can be accounted for by differences in environmental contamination or by factors that influence the level of exposure of sheep to the environment, such as age and farm management (Alvarado-Esquivel et al., 2012; Opsteegh et al., 2010b) .

Technological and operational shortcomings, such as a too high line speed, no rodding and bagging and the use of seasonal workers not sufficiently trained for the purpose, are reported as additional challenges in some abattoirs (Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety, 2012).

The reduction in E. coli just after pasteurisation was 99.5 %, corresponding to 1.85 log CFUs/cm 2 , and after 24 hours' storage 2.02 log CFUs/cm 2 .

The current combination of animal traceability, ante-mortem inspection and gross tissue examination can support the collection of appropriate samples for residue monitoring. Nevertheless, a major weakness is that, with very few exceptions, presence of chemical hazards cannot be identified by current ante-/post-mortem meat inspection procedures at the slaughterhouse level and there is a lack of sufficient cost-effective and reliable screening methods. In addition, sampling is mostly prescriptive rather than risk or information based.

Therefore, a range of different breeds have been developed over centuries to suit the land and weather and husbandry conditions in different areas of the EU. In mountain and arid areas, for example, sheep are bred for hardiness and self-reliance (e.g. Scottish Blackface). They must be able to survive poor weather and thrive on poor grazing. Lowland or grassland breeds, on the other hand (e.g. Suffolk and Texel), usually do not cope as well with bad weather or poor-quality feed, but produce higher numbers of lambs that are often better suited for meat production. Most lambs are born in late winter or spring. Many lambs are born outside, particularly those in mountain flocks. Indoor lambing is also common, particularly for lowland flocks. Good housing facilities and management are important in order to prevent disease and heat stress problems. Most meat-breed sheep are slaughtered and presented for meat inspection as younger stock \"lambs\" from ten weeks up to one year.

Together with Fasciola hepatica, they are considered as economically significant parasites of livestock, including sheep and goats, although both species are known to cause foodborne infections. Acquisition of this parasite by humans can occur when subjects inadvertently ingest infested second intermediate hosts (ants)(Krauss et al., 2003), but there is no evidence of meat being a vehicle for transmission of D. dendriticum to humans.E. granulosus is a small tapeworm that causes hydatid disease, or cystic echinococcosis, in humans. There were 530 human cases of echinococcosis reported in 2011 due to E. granulosus, i.e. 85.1 % of cases for which the Echinococcus species had been determined (EFSA and ECDC, 2013b). The definitive hosts are dogs and other canids, and ungulates(sheep, goats, pigs, horses, etc.)  are the intermediate hosts. Other mammals, including humans, can also act as intermediate hosts, and can play a role in the transmission cycle (intermediate hosts) or are dead ends of the development (aberrant hosts", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF19": {"text": "Gongylonema pulchrumG. pulchrum, along with most other Gongylonema nematodes, has a broad natural host range that includes ruminants, pigs, rabbits and others. The vector and intermediate host for G. pulchrum infections are coprophagous insects (dung beetles and cockroaches). Transmission to humans is usually the result of unsanitary conditions resulting in the accidental ingestion of infected vectors. The ingested larva infects the upper oesophagus, develops and matures into adult worms after two subsequent moulting stages, then migrates into the buccal cavity where it lays eggs. On the basis of the information available from the scientific literature, G. pulchrum should not be considered for risk ranking as it is not transmitted via consumption of meat.L. serrata is a cosmopolitan zoonotic parasite with its adult form occurring in the nasal and respiratory passages of canids as the definitive hosts, while its immature stages localise in the mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, lungs, and, rarely, in other organs, such as the ocular region of herbivorous intermediate hosts. Humans can behave as both intermediate and final host and are infected by visceral and nasopharyngeal linguatulosis. Consumption of infected, improperly cooked viscera of the intermediate hosts, including sheep, goats, cattle, camels or other herbivores, containing the larval stages of this parasite is a potential source of infection of human beings with the nasopharyngeal form of linguatulosis. However, nasopharyngeal secretions or faeces of carnivores containing eggs of Linguatula are the main sources for infecting human beings with the visceral form of this infection(Oryan et al., 2011;Tappe and Buettner, 2009). Most of the literature is from Iran, also Turkey, India and Romania, although sporadic cases have also been reported in Germany(Tappe et al., 2006) andAustria (Koehsler et al., 2011). Owing to the low number of human cases reported in the literature, it is assumed that this parasite is not widely distributed at the moment in the small ruminant population in the EU. Further, recent reports of human cases are linked to transmission from the final host (i.e. canids) and not through consumption of meat from small ruminants.M. expansa is a tapeworm that inhabits the small intestine of ruminants. The life cycle also involves oribatid (soil) mites as intermediate hosts. It was not considered a zoonotic parasite, but there has been at least one report of human infection with M. expansa(el-Shazly et al., 2004). Meat is not suspected as the vehicle for infection.Sarcocystis spp. are coccidian protozoans that infect humans and have a worldwide distribution. Although theoretically Sarcocystis spp. that infect small ruminants could also infect humans as the final host, the main source of human infection are the cattle and pig species, S. hominis and S. suihominis respectively. Although present in Europe, the prevalence of small ruminant Sarcocystis is not known(Martinez-Navalon et al., 2012). There are no reports of human sarcosporidiosis attributed to consumption of meat from small ruminants in the EU. Europe concerning experimental infections only. For this reason, it can be concluded that the role of small ruminants in the epidemiology of human trichinellosis is very small in Europe, if it does indeed contribute at all to human infection.Trichostrongyles are parasites of ruminants, usually found in the abomasum and small intestine. They have a worldwide distribution, including Europe, where they have been reported in the small ruminant population(Cringoli and Rinaldi, 2003; Idris et al., 2012; Pavlovic et al., 2012). Human infections are usually reported in persons that live in close quarters with the animals or by handling faecal material(Krauss et al., 2003; Wall et al., 2012).

For Group A substances, liquid or gas chromatographic separation with mass spectrometry (MS) or infra red (IR) spectrometric detection is required and, in the case of MS techniques, where mass fragments are produced, the relationship between different classes of mass fragment and identification points are specified, with a minimum of four identification points being required for confirmation. Apart from liquid or gas chromatographic separation with MS or IR spectrometric detection, suitable confirmatory techniques for Group B substances may include liquid chromatography (LC) with diode-array or fluorescence detection for appropriate molecules, twodimensional thin layer chromatography (2-D TLC) with full-scan ultraviolet visible (UV/VIS) detection, and GC-ECD (electron capture detector), LC-immunogram or LC-UV/VIS where at least two different chromatographic separations are used.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF42": {"text": "SCVPHScientific Committee on Veterinary measures relating to Public Health", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF43": {"text": "Summary .............................................................................................................................................. 163 Table of contents .................................................................................................................................. 165", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF44": {"text": "Inspection requirements for small ruminants according to Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 (V, visual inspection; P, palpation; I, incision).

ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection, is recognised as a valuable tool for surveillance and monitoring of animal diseases and welfare conditions, and helps in the recognition of outbreaks of existing or new disorders or disease syndromes, in situations where clinical signs are not detected on-farm. Meat inspection represents a practical way to evaluate the welfare of small ruminants on-farm, and the only way to evaluate their welfare during transport and associated handling. Changes in the meat inspection system may negatively affect the efficiency of the surveillance and monitoring of animal diseases and welfare conditions. The focus of the Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW) Panel was to assess the implications for surveillance of animal health and welfare of the changes proposed to the current small ruminants meat inspection system by the Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) and Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) Panels. Briefly, the recommendations of the BIOHAZ Panel were related to (i) shorter transport and lairaging, (ii) improved collection of food chain information to provide information for categorisation of farms, which can be used for e.g. risk-based ante-mortem inspection, logistic slaughter and/or decontamination, (iii) omission of palpation and incision in animals subjected to routine slaughter at post-mortem inspection (if necessary, detailed inspection with potential use of palpation and incision should be carried out separately). The CONTAM Panel recommendations included (i) the ranking system for chemical substances of potential concern and its updating, (ii) the use of FCI to help facilitate risk-based sampling strategies, and (iii) the inclusion of new hazards in control programmes for chemical residues and contaminants.To assess the impact of proposed changes to the current meat inspection on the overall sensitivity for surveillance and control of animal diseases and welfare conditions, the results and conclusions of a quantitative assessment, carried out by an external consortium (COMISURV) under an EFSA procurement, were analysed. This report assessed the impact of a change from the current small ruminant meat inspection to a visual only system in terms of detection efficiency of a list of twenty selected diseases and welfare conditions of sheep and goats. Additional information from scientific literature and other recent assessments were also taken into account by experts to assess the impact of proposed changes on the detection probability and overall surveillance of animal diseases and welfare conditions.A change to visual only inspection caused a significant reduction in the probability of detection (i.e. non-overlapping 90 % probability intervals) of detectable cases of fasciolosis and tuberculosis in goats (Stage 2).With regard to exotic diseases, clinical surveillance (Stage 3) had a greater sensitivity for detecting foot and mouth disease than slaughterhouse surveillance, and the sensitivity increased with an increase in population size. This indicates that for those countries in Europe with a large sheep population, clinical surveillance is highly effective for detecting at least one case of foot and mouth disease in an infected sheep. For countries with high slaughter numbers of sheep, slaughterhouse surveillance would be almost equally efficient in detecting the disease. A change in post-mortem protocol to a visual only system did not significantly reduce the detection of any welfare conditions.In recent years tuberculosis has been reported in small ruminants in several EU countries and most information derives from recognition of tuberculosus lesions at the slaughterhouse and from laboratory reports. According to Regulation (EC) 854/2004, current inspection in small ruminants aimed at detecting tuberculosis includes visual inspection and palpation of the lungs and respiratory lymph nodes. A change to visual inspection would imply abandoning palpation, which is the reason for this reduced detection. Surveillance of tuberculosis at the slaughterhouse for small ruminants should be improved and encouraged, as this is in practice the only surveillance system available. The detection of tuberculosis in small ruminants should be adequately recorded and followed at the farm level. Detectable cases: cases that are detectable by routine meat inspection procedures. They will express a range of combinations of clinical and pathological signs. A proportion of detectable cases will fit the definition of the typical case and a proportion will be milder cases.Detection effectiveness: the proportion of animals with lesions (i.e. detectable by visual inspection, palpation and/or incision) that are actually detected.Detection fraction: the proportion of infected or affected units that are successfully detected by the surveillance system.Mild cases: the mild case of a disease or condition is the form that could be seen at the early stages of the disease or at some point between the subclinical and the fully developed (i.e. \"typical\") form. A mild case is neither typical nor subclinical. The animal will probably present more subtle signs than in a typical case. Mild cases fit the mild case definition validated by experts.Monitoring: investigating samples or animals in order to obtain information about the frequency of disease or infection as it varies in time and/or space.Non-detectable cases: cases that are beyond the detection capacity of current meat inspection protocols. These will often be early cases at a stage where distinct clinical signs have not yet developed, but they can be cases with mild infection that leads to only subclinical conditions, without pathological lesions detectable by meat inspection.Non-overlapping probability intervals: indicates that scenarios differ significantly from each other.Overall surveillance system: includes several components, such as slaughterhouse surveillance and clinical surveillance.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SUMMARY"}, {"text": "Stage 2: assessment of the probability of detection at meat inspection. The objective of Stage 2 modelling was to estimate case type-specific (for typical and mild cases) as well as overall probabilities of detection at meat inspection.Stage 3: assessment of the relative effectiveness of meat inspection within the overall surveillance system by comparing meat inspection with other available surveillance methods.Typical cases: cases that are, by definition, detectable cases and express more developed clinical signs than mild cases. They fit the typical case definition provided by the experts, which is defined as signs and/or lesions that are expected to be observed in more than 60 % of affected or infected of animals seen at the slaughterhouse.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Slaughterhouse surveillance: surveillance by meat inspection in slaughterhouses."}]}
