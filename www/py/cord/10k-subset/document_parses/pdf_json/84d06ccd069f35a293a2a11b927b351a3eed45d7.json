Based on the contact process, we study numerically how weak ties influence the predictability of epidemic dynamics. We first investigate the effects of the degree of bridge nodes on the variabilities of both the arrival time and the prevalence of disease, and find out that the bridge node with a small degree can enhance the predictability of epidemic spreading. Once weak ties are settled, the variability of the prevalence will display a complete opposite trend to that of the arrival time, as the distance from the initial seed to the bridge node or the degree of the initial seed increases. More specifically, the further distance and the larger degree of the initial seed can induce the better predictability of the arrival time and the worse predictability of the prevalence. Moreover, we discuss the effects of the number of weak ties on the epidemic variability. As the community strength becomes very strong, which is caused by the decrease of the number of weak ties, the epidemic variability will change dramatically. Compared with the case of the hub seed and the random seed, the bridge seed can result in the worst predictability of the arrival time and the best predictability of the prevalence.",

            "text": "Community structures at mesoscale level are ubiquitous in a variety of real-world complex systems, 1 such as Facebook, 2 YouTube, 3 and Xiaonei. 4 In general, there are more connections between members in the same community than that between members from different communities, where the links that connect pairs of nodes belonging to different communities are defined as weak ties. [5] [6] [7] The weak ties hypothesis, which is first proposed by Granovetter, 8 is a central concept in the social network analysis. 9,10 Weak ties not only play a role in effecting social cohesion 11 but also are helpful for stabilizing complex systems under most conditions. 12 Recently, weak ties have been shown to destabilize ecosystems under specific conditions. 13 Epidemic spreading, [14] [15] [16] [17] a fundamental dynamical process, is one of the most important subjects in the complex network theory. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] Inspired by the significant effects of weak ties on the dynamics on networks, 12 many recent works have contributed to understanding the interplay between weak ties and spreading dynamics on community networks. [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] Onnela et al. found that weak ties can significantly slow the diffusion process, leading to the dynamic trapping of information on communities. 28, 29 As weak ties are removed gradually, the coverage of information will drop sharply. 30 On adaptive networks, strong communities with weak ties may prevent disease propagation. 31, 32 In order to assess the accuracy and the forecasting capabilities of numerical models, the predictability of outbreaks has been investigated in many studies. [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] Colizza et al. studied the effect of airline transportation network on the predictability of epidemic patterns by means of the normalized entropy function 38 and found that the heterogeneous weight distribution contributes to enhancing the predictability. Cr epey et al. found that initial conditions such as the degree heterogeneity of the initial seed can induce a large variability on the prediction of the prevalence. 39 Loecher and Kadtke argued that the random walk centrality (RWC) serves as a better index than degree to predict the prevalence of disease. 40 community structure with the random SFN, the predictability of its global prevalence was found to be better. 41 Considering the relative independence of a local community, Gong et al. investigated the prevalence and its variability on the local community, and found that the extraordinarily large variability in the early stage of outbreaks made the prediction of epidemic spreading hard. 42 In addition, Zhao et al. studied how the heterogeneous time delay (HETD) associated with geographical distance influences the spreading speed and the variability of the prevalence. Owing to the correlations between time delay and network hierarchy in the HETD, the epidemic spreading is slowed down obviously and the predictability of the prevalence is reduced remarkably. 43 On community networks, as mentioned above, weak ties play a very significant role in epidemic dynamics. But until now, there is no study on the effects of weak ties on the predictability of epidemic dynamics. In this paper, we investigate how weak ties influence the predictability of the epidemic dynamics on community networks. We show numerically that both the degree of bridge nodes and the number of weak ties can remarkably influence the predictability of the epidemic spreading on a local community. More importantly, we find out that the variability of the arrival time always displays a complete opposite trend to that of the prevalence, which implies that it is impossible to predict the epidemic spreading in the early stage of outbreaks accurately.",

Unfortunately, there is not a generally accepted and authenticated community detection algorithm; 18, 48, 49 thus, it is difficult to identify weak ties accurately on real-world networks. We here consider a community network model comprised two confined communities A and B. Except for the community structure, degree heterogeneity is another important feature of realworld community networks. [44] [45] [46] [47] In this study, we focus on the community network with degree heterogeneity. To be specific, two independent Barab asi-Albert (BA) scale-free networks 50, 51 with the same size are first produced, and then these two networks are connected by few links. In order to normalize the terms of community network, we define the links between two communities as weak ties, 28 and call the nodes connected by these weak ties bridge nodes. 11, 52 Obviously, the network has a strong community structure because of few weak ties. With the increase of the number of weak ties, the community structure will be weakened.",

For simplicity, we only study susceptible-infected (SI) 15 spreading dynamics through numerical simulations, which is a classical model of the CP. In the model, \"S\" and \"I\" represent, respectively, the susceptible (or healthy) and the infected states. At the beginning, a node is selected as the initial infected (i.e., seed) and all other nodes are in \"S\" state. At each time step, each infected node randomly contacts one of its neighbors, and then the contacted neighboring node will be infected with probability k if it is in the healthy state, or else it will retain its state. Once an individual is infected, it will keep its state forever. To eliminate the stochastic effect of disease propagation, we set k \u00bc 1.",

In the CP, weak ties with the different combinations of k A b $ k B b have different effects on the propagation from the first community A to the second community B. As a first step towards this, we consider the case of one weak tie between two communities. Reference 42 showed that once the spreading starts on the second community, the seed is irrelevant. That is to say, different k B b hardly affect the epidemic spreading on the second community B. Therefore, by varying the k A b only, we investigate how different k A b influence the predictability of the epidemic dynamics on the second community B. In simulations, a node with the fixed degree k A b in the first community A is connected with a randomly chosen node in the second community B. Fig. 1 shows the mean arrival time ht a i and its variability D\u00f0t a \u00de on the second community B when different degrees of bridge nodes are created. When the bridge node b A of the first community A is chosen as the seed, that is d \u00bc 0 (d is the geodesic distance from the initial infected node to the bridge node b A ), the mean arrival time ht a i is linear with the degree of the bridge node k A b . As the bridge node of the second com-munity b B is one neighbor of the bridge node b A , it will be infected with probability 1=k A b at each time step, which is obviously a Poisson process. So the mean arrival time ht a i is equal to k A b and its relative variation is r\u00f0t a \u00de=ht a i ' 1. When the disease seed is a node with one step to the bridge node b A (i.e., d \u00bc 1), the mean arrival time ht a i for different k A b will increase compared with the case of d \u00bc 0. For a small k A b ; ht a i is significantly greater than that of d \u00bc 0, e.g., ht a i\u00f0d \u00bc 1\u00de % 15 ) ht a i\u00f0d \u00bc 0\u00de % 5 for k A b \u00bc 5.

Here, we investigate the effects of different degrees of the initial seed on the variability of the epidemic dynamics on the second community B when the distance between the initial seed and the bridge node b A is d \u00bc 1. As shown in Figs. 4 and 5, when k A b \u00bc 5 is small, D\u00f0t a \u00de and D\u00bdi\u00f0T\u00de are obviously affected by the degree of the seed, while there is almost no effect on the variability when k A b \u00bc 242 is large. When k A b \u00bc 5, the large degree of the initial seed will result in a large ht a i (Fig. 4(a) ) and a small D\u00f0t a \u00de (Fig. 4(c) ). Owing to the finite contact ability of the initial seed with the large degree, it will cost more time to infect the bridge node b A in the first process, that is the large ht a i. In the process, the bridge node b A may be infected through two basic pathways. For the initial seed with a small degree, the bridge node b A is infected directly with higher probability. Thus, the first process introduces a larger D\u00f0t 1 \u00de because of the randomness of the Poisson process, and thus D\u00f0t a \u00de in the whole process increases according to Eq. (8). In addition, Fig. 5(c) shows that the variability of the prevalence increases with the degree of the initial seed, which is consistent with the trend of the mean arrival time in Fig. 4(a) . We should note that the degree of the initial seed has an opposite effect on the variabilities of the arrival time and the prevalence, which may bring about a great trouble for the pandemic prevention and control.",

By adding the number of weak ties l AB between two communities randomly, we can obtain the community networks with different Q n . Fig. 6 shows the case of three kinds of the initial seed: bridge node, random node, and hub. In Fig. 6(a) , with the increase of Q n , the mean arrival time ht a i will increase because fewer weak ties lengthen the distance between two communities. Especially when Q n ! 0:9, the mean arrival time ht a i will increase rapidly. Compared with the other two cases, the case of the bridge node chosen as the initial seed has the shortest ht a i. The case of the random node includes the cases of the bridge node and the non-bridge node, so ht a i for the random seed must be longer than that for the bridge seed. For the case of the hub, it has the longest mean arrival time. As the nodes connected by weak ties are chosen randomly, the nodes with a small degree will be more probably chosen as bridge nodes due to the degree heterogeneity, while it is very difficult for the hubs to be bridge nodes. When the degree of the bridge node is small, the initial seed with a large degree leads to the longer ht a i (see Fig. 4(a) ).",

As mentioned in Fig. 1(b) , the further distance of the initial seed to the bridge node b A can reduce the variability D\u00f0t a \u00de. With the increase of Q n , the distance between two communities is lengthened by fewer weak ties, and thus D\u00f0t a \u00de will decrease. For example, when Q n increases from 0.9 to 1, D\u00f0t a \u00de for the random case decreases from 0.33 to 0.18 rapidly. For the case of the hub, its arrival time has the most accurate predictability. It is because that the initial seed with a large degree can lead to a low variability when the bridge node b A has a small degree (see Fig. 4(c) ). More significant, D\u00f0t a \u00de for the case of the bridge node increases with the network modularity Q n , which is opposite to the other two cases. Even though a bridge node b A i is chosen as the initial seed, the infection to community B is not always through the weak tie of the bridge node b A i because of the existence of many other weak ties. That is, there are two optional spreading pathways towards the community B: the weak tie of b A i and the other weak ties. Thus, the actual path length of epidemic spreading must be greater than 1. In other words, more links will result in the longer distance of the infection process. Therefore, more weak ties can reduce D\u00f0t a \u00de due to the increase of the distance between the community A and the community B. Actually, more weak ties can increase the deterministic of the second optional pathway, and thus enhances the predictability of the arrival time.",

When the degree of the bridge node is large, the variability of the arrival time is close to 1, and the variability of the prevalence is very large. When the degree of the bridge node is small, the further distance of the initial seed to the bridge node (or the larger degree of the initial seed when d \u00bc 1) will enhance the predictability of the arrival time due to the approximate determinacy of the indirect transmission in infecting the bridge node b A , while the predictability of the prevalence in the early stage will get worse due to the uncertain arrival time of disease. These results suggest that the bridge node with a small degree may be an important detection station for the epidemic control on community networks. Taking global epidemics on the airline network, for example, 38, 67 the slackened precaution at a small international airport may bring a lot of trouble to the prediction and control of disease.",

It is important to note that the variability of the prevalence will increase rapidly when the community strength is strong enough, which is in accordance with the trend of the mean arrival time. By contrast, owing to the Poisson property of the transmission on weak ties, the variability of the arrival time for the case of the bridge node increases with the network modularity, which displays the worst predictability of the arrival time. But the best predictability of the prevalence is observed when the bridge node is first infected, which is originated from the shortest arrival time for this case. These results suggest that although the strong community structure can delay the infection from one community to another, it can also cause the unpredictability of the epidemic spreading on these communities.
