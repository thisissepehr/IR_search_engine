The pathogen is present in very high levels within infected plants and can be transmitted by a broad range of mechanisms; therefore early specific detection is vital for effective disease management. In this study, a polyclonal antibody (pAb) was developed and deployed in a lateral flow device (LFD) format to allow rapid in-field detection of Xcm. Published Xcm PCR assays were also independently assessed: only two assays gave specific amplification of Xcm, whilst others cross-reacted with non-target Xanthomonas species. Pure cultures of Xcm were used to immunize a rabbit, the IgG antibodies purified from the serum and the resulting polyclonal antibodies tested using ELISA and LFD. Testing against a wide range of bacterial species showed the pAb detected all strains of Xcm, representing isolates from seven countries and the known genetic diversity of Xcm. The pAb also detected the closely related Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. vasculorum (Xav), primarily a sugarcane pathogen. Detection was successful in both naturally and experimentally infected banana plants, and the LFD limit of detection was 10 5 cells mL \u00c01 . Whilst the pAb is not fully specific for Xcm, Xav has never been found in banana. Therefore the LFD can be used as a first-line screening tool to detect Xcm in the field. Testing by LFD requires no equipment, can be performed by non-scientists and is cost-effective.

It was first found in Ethiopia around 40 years ago on enset (Yirgou & Bradbury, 1978) and is now widespread in east and central Africa.

The genus is composed of two groups, with Xcm sitting within Group 2 along with many other important plant pathogens (Rodriguez-R et al., 2012) . The taxonomy of species and pathovars is very complex and still evolving, meaning confusion can exist over the identity of isolates within culture collections and that species identification can be problematic for diagnostic laboratories (Parkinson et al., 2009) . Xcm was initially described as Xanthomonas musacearum and was reclassified Xcm in 1978 (Young et al., 1978) . It has recently been proposed that Xcm should be reclassified as X. vasicola pv. musacearum (Xvm) due to its close relatedness to strains of X. vasicola. Indeed, partial gyrB sequences have shown 100% nucleotide sequence identity between Xcm and some X. vasicola isolates, and FAME and rep-PCR methods group Xcm with X. vasicola (Aritua et al., 2008; Tripathi et al., 2009) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 241, "end": 267, "text": "(Rodriguez-R et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 508, "end": 532, "text": "(Parkinson et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 622, "end": 642, "text": "(Young et al., 1978)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 974, "end": 995, "text": "(Aritua et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 996, "end": 1018, "text": "Tripathi et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Recent whole-genome comparisons of Xcm and X. vasicola pv. vasculorum (Xvv) are also corroborative, finding significantly greater nucleotide identity with each other than with any other sequenced xanthomonad.

Studied Xcm isolates have demonstrated very little genetic diversity, with comparisons of whole genomes showing at least 99\u00c199% nucleotide identity (Wasukira et al., 2012) . Despite this, genome-wide analyses looking for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation have proposed two major sub-lineages within Xcm, each corresponding to a distinct geographic region. Whilst this is based on only 86 SNPs and a relatively small number of isolates, it splits sub-lineage I containing isolates from Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda from sub-lineage II comprising isolates from Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi and Kenya (Wasukira et al., 2012) .

Typically, Xcm detection is based upon visual symptom expression and culture-based morphological assessment. Recently, semiselective media for Xcm have been developed (Mwangi et al., 2007; Tripathi et al., 2007) but this approach has been found to be lacking as it is time-consuming, requires confirmatory testing and often misses early stages of infection (Adikini et al., 2011) . Biochemical tests can be used in some cases to resolve species and pathovars; however, approaches such as metabolomic profiling (e.g. Biolog) are timeconsuming, whilst fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis is costly (Aritua et al., 2008; Adikini et al., 2011) . As an alternative, molecular approaches have been investigated to allow the specific detection of Xcm including conventional PCR (Lewis Ivey et al., 2010; Adikini et al., 2011; Adriko et al., 2012) or rep-PCR (Versalovic et al., 1994) . Since the recent discovery of sub-lineages within Xcm, Wasukira et al. (2012) have developed a PCR-RFLP assay to allow discrimination of the lineages.

The requirement of such diagnostic approaches for Xcm is essential to facilitate elimination of residual sources of infection and improve disease management (Ocimati et al., 2013) . This is critical for diseases such as BXW where, by the time symptoms are visible, the pathogen has spread systemically and therefore poses a high risk of further transmission (Adikini et al., 2013) , and where latent infection can occur with long incubation periods (Ocimati et al., 2013) . Therefore this study set out to develop an antibody-based diagnostic kit for Xcm that could be deployed in a low-resource setting, providing a cost-effective diagnosis that can be performed by untrained personnel. A further advantage of this approach for diseases of this kind is that testing can occur simultaneously with control. Divorcing sampling from testing by sending samples to the laboratory can potentially lead to delays and loss of urgency on the part of growers.

The substantial reduction of the ELISA limit of detection when testing in a plant background compared to pure bacterial culture is probably due to the much larger number of proteins competing for binding sites and therefore reducing the sensitivity, an effect considerably reduced when testing by LFD. Five samples were found to fail under ELISA testing due to degradation of samples during shipping, and two samples were negative, presumably due to levels of infection below the limit of detection, whereas all of these were positive when tested by LFD.

LFDs are suited to this setting, being costeffective, portable, easy to use and providing almost instantaneous results.
