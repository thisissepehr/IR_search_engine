Innumerable other examples may be cited where data are politically misrepresented, delaying effective response. Political forces are sometimes counterproductive and touch the broader arenas of public interaction and public health (Editors of Lancet, 2004; Colmers and Fox, 2003; Schneider and Fassin, 2002; Durban Declaration, 2000; Fox, 1999; Epstein, 1996; Laswell, 1958) . Examples include political manipulation of M&E activities assessing emotionally charged subjects (reproductive choice, rape, child abuse, family violence), polarizing forces (privatization and social services reform; racial, gender, and ethnic equity), and government accountability to citizens (policing, infrastructure, education, defense) (Blackburn, 2004; Human Rights Watch, 2003 , 2004a , 2004b Transparency International, 2004; United Nations Children's Fund, 2003a , 2003b United Nations Development Fund, 2002) . Recently, M&E scrutiny into public health responses mounted to identify and contain infectious diseases such as severe, acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), West Nile virus, bovine spongiform encephalitis (mad cow disease), and avian flu, to name a few, have been politicized by economic, ideological, and scientific stakeholders (Parry, 2004; Reilly and others, 2003; Abbasi, 2000; Lacey, 1994) .",

Historically, some of the most notorious examples illustrating institutional denial of impending epidemics are illustrated by city-state responses to the plagues that swept across Europe in the late thirteenth century (Scott and Duncan, 2001; Ziegler, 1991) . Of note, a few of these governments were relatively transparent about the effects of the plague, despite serious threats of economic disaster and quarantine. This may have occurred because the exact cause and modes of plague transmission were poorly understood. Further, many city-states were not powerful enough to prevent the dissemination of information beyond their boundaries. However, most denied the existence of plague infection within their jurisdictions. In Florence, more than one year after the plague was evident, the city's Great Council remained silent. \"Perhaps the Councillors believed, not without reason, that it did not lie in their power to avert disaster and that, therefore, the less said the better\" (Ziegler, 1991, p. 39) .",

Although relatively simple and inexpensive HIV testing methods exist and subpopulation seroprevalence data within countries should be relatively easy to obtain, national governments have continued to maintain secrecy on true prevalence and even deny the presence of HIV and AIDS. A variation on the denial of HIV infection prevalence is denial of it as the cause of AIDS. One of the most famous examples of this occurred in 2000 when South African President Thabo Mbeki wrote that he doubted HIV causes AIDS. This unleashed a firestorm of criticism from the scientific community; more than 5,000 scientists ultimately signed the subsequent Durban Declaration (2000) affirming that HIV causes AIDS. Others have argued that Mbeki was misquoted from the beginning and that his comments were meant to state that HIV alone is not the cause of AIDS, emphasizing the multifactorial nature of the epidemic. Poverty, for example, has been linked to exacerbation of HIV in the developing world (Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa, 2004; Gow, 2002) .",

This stereotype, perpetuated by overplayed early risk evaluation data coupled with persistent structural discrimination toward high-risk populations, presents an obstacle to prevention efforts. M&E data were used to assign risk to groups of people rather than to risky behaviors. Fortunately, such assignments have reversed. Risky behaviors, such as commercial sex work, injecting drugs, and unprotected sexual intercourse, contribute to the growing epidemic because of not only the risk presented to the individuals themselves but also the pathways and bridges they make, carrying HIV to their partners in the general population worldwide (Choi, Gibson, Han, and Guo, 2004) . For this reason, partners who are not engaged in risky behavior themselves do not perceive themselves at risk of HIV infection, but they are still vulnerable.",

Despite a lack of cure or a vaccine, HIV infection rates are actually declining in Uganda. In 1991, 21 percent of pregnant women were HIV-positive; ten years later, that number declined to 6 percent. Uganda took an open, comprehensive, and courageous approach that has largely defused HIV stigma there. The heart of Uganda's approach has been behavioral change, promoted by the \"ABC\" model: Abstinence, Being faithful, and Condom use.

Through NHA and NAA, critical information may be obtained about equity of resource distribution among different populations, geographical locations, and specific interventions. The SIDILAC project in Latin America has refined a method to track both public expenditures and out-of-pocket costs for HIV/AIDS within country budgets (Marais and Wilson for Joint United Nations Programmme on HIV/AIDS, 2002). Analysis of the data has demonstrated serious misallocations of resources. The Latin America region, for example, significantly underspends on prevention efforts. In eight countries in the region, less than one-third of HIV/AIDS spending is directed toward public health and prevention. Even more worrisome is the gross underspending on key vulnerable groups, such as bisexual men and women, commercial sex workers, and injection-drug users, even though these vulnerable populations ultimately accounted for a large proportion of new cases of infection (Marais and Wilson, 2002) . One of the most worrisome aspects of resource tracking data, however, is the unmasking of possible corruption or the diversion of funds into other activities for which donations were not intended. All of these tensions can complicate credible analysis of resource flows within M&E programs.",

With these new initiatives, we are witnessing a shift in methods of funds disbursement. There is now an increasing requirement for performance-or results-based financial disbursements. Funding will be carefully tied to specific, timelimited achievement of indicators and targets, and the next transfer of monies will not occur unless these reports are received and predefined targets achieved. Depending on donor flexibility and contractual language, overspecifying deliverables and time frames at project initiation may preclude program adjustments that might be necessary based on early and ongoing feedback. Although many donors in the past have stated that accountability is part of the funding process, such close linking of results to funding renewal is unprecedented.

Emphasis on cost containment in already resource-strapped environments may exacerbate an environmental tendency toward reporting inaccuracy because of workforce demoralization (Kapiriri, Norheim, and Heggenhougen, 2003) . When the health system is decentralized as part of more general reform of the system, reform of health management and services also occurs. The health system reform in Zambia is an example. In that effort, it soon became clear that central health services management and political capacity lacked transparency where planning and implementation of policies and resource allocation were concerned. When this capacity was transferred to regional levels, it became obvious that transparency and not a lack of ideas or concepts was the problem in tracking the epidemic (Stekelenburg and Peeperkorn, 2004) . On the other hand, when local systems are open to scrutiny through surveys that measure service coverage and quality of work, potentially \"punitive\" action may result. Budgetrelated performance indicators such as operational plans and service deliverables that do not meet expected levels (or nonperformance) may result in policy or program shifts, human resource changes, and increased pressure to deliver (Government of Malawi, 2002) . Establishing structures for inclusive, participatory planning with subnational health providers who are granted selected decision-making and priority-setting powers may contribute to eliminating threats and maintaining the accuracy of facilitybased surveys.",

For example, compelling all pregnant women to be tested for HIV is a dilemma. On the one hand, determining seropositivity can offer the fetus protection against HIV infection; on the other, it values protecting the fetus over the choices and freedoms of the woman to be tested and treated or not. van Niekerk (2001) described such complexities inherent in dealing with the epidemic, noting that they \"may not be successfully addressed even through an analytical approach wherein we distinguish parts and whole, often with the expectation that addressing the parts will fix the whole\" (p. 145). M&E programs, thus, must strike a balance between generating meaningful tactical-level information for program managers while taking steps to ensure public data use does not worsen discrimination and stigma experienced by those who are HIV seropositive.",

The same authors note that the problem of politically motivated selective use may be compounded by interpretations that are \"simply wrong.\" For example, findings from Kwaramba's study examining the socioeconomic effects of HIV/AIDS on agriculture in a discrete region in Zimbabwe were misapplied by others to the whole country (Whiteside, Barnett, George, and van Niekirk, 2003) . Those engaged in M&E have a professional and ethical responsibility to clearly disclaim the limits of data sources and the analyses based on them to ensure that the scale and scope of problems are as accurately portrayed as possible. Friction exists between the sense of urgency surrounding response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the responsibility of researchers and M&E professionals to accept and use quality data and to view it critically (Whiteside, Barnett, George, and van Niekirk, 2003) .",

A review of the available data shows that needle-exchange programs combined with other \"harm-reduction\" efforts can usually, but not always, be effective in limiting HIV transmission among injection-drug users. Continuing research is clearly needed regarding how to maximize the availability of sterile injection equipment and how to integrate this with other needed health and social services. Recently, the criticisms of needle exchange have been largely based not on epidemiological data but on the symbolic meaning of needle-exchange programs. These programs are said to \"condone drug use\" and \"send the wrong message about drug use.\" Similar arguments are advanced by those objecting to the distribution of condoms, lubricant, and clean injecting supplies to inmates in prisons, despite scientific evidence that the use of these measures decreases the spread of HIV (May and Williams, 2002) . Illustrating the triumph of politics and ideology over science, condoms are available in less than 1 percent of U.S. jails and prisons (May and Williams, 2002) . These value conflicts have greatly hampered the collection of relevant data and have shifted the grounds for opposition from scientific criteria to the symbolic meaning (Des Jarlais, 2000) .",

In addition to conducting the needed research, efficient peer review processes to assess these studies are critical. In 2000, the U.S. Congress enacted the Data Quality Act and directed the White House Office of Management and Budget to develop guidelines to ensure the quality of data disseminated by the federal government. Whereas the goal of improving the assessment of the credibility of research studies and dissemination of such information may be worthy, there are, nevertheless, substantial concerns. If the peer review process is too unwieldy and burdensome, a form of gridlock may occur in which nothing gets accomplished because the scientific basis of any potentially controversial piece of information or regulation is continually being challenged (Steinbrook, 2004; Whiteside, Barnett, George, and van Niekirk, 2003) .",
