In spite of this, little is known about the developmental alteration from its appearance to the time of hatching. In the current study the CAM has been studied by classical stereology and allometry. Expression levels of selected angiogenesis-related molecules were estimated by RT-PCR and cell dynamics assessed by proliferation and apoptosis assays. Absolute CAM volume increased from a low of 0.47 \u00b1 0.11 cm 3 at embryonic day 8 (E8) to a high of 2.05 \u00b1 0.27 cm 3 at E18, and then decreased to 1.6 \u00b1 0.47 cm 3 at E20. On allometric analysis, three growth phases were identifiable. Between E8-13 (phase I), the CAM grew fastest; moderately in phase II (E13-18) but was regressing in phase III (E18-20). The chorion, the mesenchyme and the allantoic layers grew fastest in phase I, but moderately in phase II. The mesenchyme grew slowly in phase III while the chorion and allantois were regressing. Chorionic cell volume increased fastest in phase I and was regressing in phase III. Chorionic capillaries grew steadily in phase I and II but regressed in phase III. Both the chorion and the allantois grew by intrinsic cell proliferation as well as recruitment of cells from the mesenchyme. Cell proliferation was prominent in the allantois and chorion early during development, declined after E17 and apoptosis started mainly in the chorion from E14. VEGFR2 expression peaked at E11 and declined steadily towards E20, VEGF peaked at E13 and E20 while HIF 1\u03b1 had a peak at E11 and E20.

It results from the fusion of the mesodermal layers of two developmental structures: the allantois and the chorion [1] . In mammals, the chorioallantois interacts intimately with the maternal decidua basalis to form the placenta [2] . In the absence of maternal participation during development, the chick extraembryonic membranes form the sole source of support for the physiological requisites of the embryo including nourishment, gaseous exchange and excretion. For much of the incubation, the CAM, the subject of the current study, is the sole source of gaseous exchange. It is formed of three layers, which include the chorionic epithelium, the mesenchyme and the allantoic epithelium. During growth, blood capillaries and sinuses invade the chorionic layer and become lodged in between the epithelial cells and in so doing they gain close proximity with the ambient air (within 0.2 \u03bcm) [3] . In addition the CAM also plays an essential role in osteogenesis by transporting calcium into the embryo from the eggshell [4, 5] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 262, "end": 265, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 376, "end": 379, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1039, "end": 1042, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1168, "end": 1171, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1172, "end": 1174, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The CAM functions as the equivalent of the placenta in eutherians.

The filopodia from the mesenchymal cells established contact with those of the epithelial cells or with the cell walls of the epithelial cells and in so doing became part of the allantois. A similar process occurred in the chorionic layer, an indication that both layers grew by recruitment of subepithelial mesenchymal cells.

Later, Maksimov and others indicated that thickness of CAM increases from 61.9 \u00b1 2.48 \u03bcm at E7 to a maximum of 82.5 \u00b1 4.95 \u03bcm at E10 and then decreased steadily to 41.8 \u00b1 3.17 \u03bcm at E20.

The discrepancies in the data reported for the CAM emanate partly due to use of model-based methods, and perhaps also the methods of sampling employed. The decrease of CAM thickness on E14 in the study of Reizis et al was not explained but Maksimov and colleagues note that on E18 after internal pipping, the thickness of the CAM decreases primarily at the expense of the mesodermal layer [18] . This is plausible and is corroborated by the data in the current study. After internal pipping, the lungs become ventilated and the functional blood circulation in the lung is initiated at the expense of the CAM circulation. This results in decrease in blood volume in the vessels of CAM and plausibly this is replaced by water loss from the mesenchyme into the blood vessels. Blood flow through the CAM during incubation continues to increase from 1.3 ml/min at E10 to 4.5-5 ml/min at E18, with a temporal trajectory very similar to that of the egg V\u0307O2 [44, 45] but decreases after internal pipping, when the lung becomes functional.

Stage II extends from E12-E18 and this is the stage of differentiation and expansion. During this stage, various cell types in the allantois and chorion differentiate, the allantois increases in number of layers and the chorion becomes thicker and more complex in structure. Specialized cells such as the calcium transporting VC cells differentiate and gas exchange capillaries become superficially positioned in the chorion. Phase III extends from E18-E21 and this generally is the stage of regression when most CAM components are degenerating.
