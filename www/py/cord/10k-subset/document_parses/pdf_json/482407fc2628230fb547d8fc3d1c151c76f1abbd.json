The patient's defenses have also been weakened by severe impairment of the physical barrier functions due to the very aggressive preparative therapy necessary for bone marrow transplantation. This gives rise to infections derived primarily from the bacterial microflora reservoirs of the patient, such as gram-negative bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract and grampositive bacteria from the integument such as Staphylococcus epidermidis from the skin. In recent experience gram-positive bacteria have replaced gram-negative bacteria as the dominant sources of infection.

First, one could try to develop less toxic preparative regimens so that the barrier function was less impaired. The preparative regimen that we developed in our center is one in which total-body irradiation (TBI) is replaced by a seemingly less toxic agent such as busulfan (1). Such a regimen permits a very short period of aplasia (for only 5 to 7 days), which markedly reduces the danger to the patient. Second, one could try to reduce the patient's own microflora reservoirs by providing a gnotobiotic, highly restricted environment. It has been shown that patients with aplastic anemia who were placed in such an environment had a significantly increased probability of survival following bone marrow transplantation (2) . Third, one could try to bolster the humoral immunity by passively administering antibodies against the relevant microorganisms.",

A number of critical immune events take place in this second phase. By this time host B-cell immunity has disappeared completely but donor B-cell immunity has not yet been reestablished. Adoptive T-cell donor immunity (due to mature cells that were transferred with the bone marrow) has disappeared as well. The function of the helper T cells is markedly impaired, either because the stem cells have not yet developed into the appropriate mature T cells or because the patients are receiving immunosuppressive agents. The cytotoxic effector function is also impaired in these patients. In addition to these difficulties, the donor immune system must reorient itself in a different MHC-restriction setting. Furthermore, nonspecific suppressor cells will appear 30 to 50 days after transplantation, resulting in a global impairment of the immune defense system. Acute GVHD might be present, markedly worsening the already present immune defect in the second phase of transplantation. An oversimplified definition of GVHD describes it as an immune attack by donor T lymphocytes on certain host target cells in the gastrointestinal tract, the liver, and particularly, the skin. The resultant cutaneous disease is characterized by discoloration and desquamation followed by severe erythema together with epidermal lysis in which the entire integument is affected. A number of infectious complications are associated with acute GVHD, especially those due to resistant gram-negative bacteria, but also Candida infections and gram-positive infections caused by Corynebacteria. Interstitial pneumonia, a very important infection which is often associated with acute GVHD, is discussed shortly.",

            "text": "There is an intricate relationship between GVHD and infections, Germ-free rodents which are transplanted in a germ-free environment will not develop GVHD even if they receive a mismatched transplant. Conversely, intentional contamination of these chimeric animals will cause GVHD (5). Patients in germ-free environments have a reduced incidence of severe GVHD. Furthermore, cutaneous GVHD will develop in areas which have tissue damage, especially if this damage is caused by a virus. Finally, viral infections are known to trigger GVHD in rats (6) . Could IVIG have a role in preventing GVHD? Animal studies, including some from our laboratory, indicate that when antibody against Escherichia coli is given systemically to rats, it will reduce GVHD in matched bone marrow transplants. This suggests that IVIG might have some influence on GVHD. It is possible that IVIG could act as an immune modulator. An Fcdependent blockade of reticuloendothelial structures by IVIG has been described and studies in animal models have shown that immune globulins can induce antiidiotypic regulation. Also on the basis of animal models, we know that suppressorcell function can be restored with the use of IVIG. Since specific suppressor cells are important in counteracting GVHD, this is another instance in which IVIG may play a role, at least in theory. The most important effect of IVIG, however, might be an indirect one by which prevention of infections will, in turn, avert the trigger for GVHD. Although at the present time GVHD is no longer a major problem in most transplant programs, GVHDassociated viral infections are still of great importance.",

The latter defect is quite important and suggests a potential rote for passive therapy with antibodies. Historically bone marrow transplant recipients who have high titers of complement-fixing antibodies to CMV prior to transplant have had a better prognosis for overcoming such a severe viral pneumonia.

In the next group of CMVseronegative recipients, who were given a graft from a CMV-seropositive donor, 3 of 12 patients developed viremia or viruria but none of them developed pneumonia. The low incidence of CMV interstitial pneumonia in this group indicated that IVIG might be effective in the CMV-seronegative patient even when receiving a seropositive donor graft. Unfortunately, IVIG was largely ineffective in seropositive patients. Of the 50 seropositive recipients, 33 (66%) developed a positive CMV culture and 8 developed CMV pneumonia, which was fatal in 6 cases.

For these reasons we limited our study to CMV-seropositive recipients and stratified them between two IVIG schedules, giving either 500 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 4 months or 500 mg/kg every week for 4 months. If patients became excretors of the virus, they received a dose of 500 mg/kg daily for 10 days. There were 24 patients in the standard group and 22 in the high-dose group. We observed no difference in the number of patients who became excretors--15 in the standard-dose group and 17 in the high-dose group. There was no difference in the number of patients that developed systemic disease or in the number of fatalities observed.

The mortality is relatively high (29%) even in the absence of acute GVHD. A number of viruses (such as rotavirus) are associated with hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, but recently CMV is becoming prevalent. About half of the cases of hemorrhagic gastroenteritis in our own patient population are now due to CMV; the remainder are split between rotavirus and adenovirus. Effective measures to prevent this syndrome might include the following: strict isolation, effective prevention of GVHD (since GVHD might well set the stage for hemorrhagic gastroenteritis), and possibly therapy with orally administered immune globulin. There might be a rationale for such a therapy if we consider that the gastrointestinal tract is severely injured after transplantation. The preparative therapy as well as GVHD have caused severe mucosal injury. The Peyer's patches and other gutassociated lymphoid tissues have been destroyed and must be rebuilt. In the lamina propria IgA-and IgM-producing plasma cells have disappeared. Most importantly the degradation of IgG when administered orally is much impaired in such a devastated gut. It has been shown that IgG antibody survives passage through the gastrointestinal tract and emerges as an intact molecule.

A number of infections are seen in this posttransplant phase, especially sinopulmonary infections with encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. Initially we thought that the hyposplenism associated with chronic GVHD was responsible for these infections (12) . However, we considered that there might also be an association with an IgGsubclass deficiency and we conducted a small study. IgG subclasses were determined in 28 patients. One group of 14 patients showed a marked IgG2-subclass deficiency with a very high infection rate. Twelve of these 14 patients developed infections with gram-positive organisms. Another group of 14 patients with no IgG2-subclass deficiency had a very low infection rate, with only 2 of 14 being infected. Studying these patients further we could show that the patients continued to show subclass deficiency even after they resolved the infections. However, it is not only IgG2 but also IgG4 subclass which was markedly reduced (13). To prevent these late infections one could maintain coverage against gram-positive organisms beyond day I00 and should maintain gram-positive coverage for an even longer period in patients who demonstrate chronic GVHD. Most importantly, one should maintain IVIG supplementation beyond day 120 for the first year. In our transplant center we continue IVIG supplementation as long as the subclass deficiency persists, not unlike a patient with an inborn IgGsubclass deficiency syndrome. Utilizing this strategy one can virtually eliminate late gram-positive infections.",

Do you need to do all this with patients who are undergoing autologous transplants?Dr. Tutschka: I do not think so. The incidence of interstitial pneumonia as well as hemorrhagic gastroenteritis is much reduced in autologous transplants-perhaps a quarter of that seen in allogeneic transplants. Furthermore, the immune system recovers much more readily after autologous bone marrow transplantation. On the other hand, autologous transplantation patients might provide an excellent target population in which to study more nonspecific effects, such as the reduction of infections during aplasia, because we do not have the compounding variables of GVHD, immune modulation phases, and so on. We are currently not using IVIG to the same extent in autologous transplants as we do in aUogeneic transplants but I think it is a good study population.",
