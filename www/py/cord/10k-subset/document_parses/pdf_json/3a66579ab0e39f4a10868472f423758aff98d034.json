            "text": "+ after infection with a wide variety of viruses. Through secretion of cytokines as well as cytolytic activity, these cells are capable of muting viral replication and reducing the amount of virus present within infected tissue. In recent years, additional activating and inhibitory receptors have been discovered that control both NK cell and CD8 + T-cell activation in response to stress, transformation, and/or infection. In this study, the expression and functional role of the activating receptor NKG2D and its corresponding ligands were determined in viral infection of the central nervous system (CNS). Our data highlight a previously unappreciated role for NKG2D ligand-induced signaling in host defense after viral infection of the CNS by enhancing T-cell effector function and regulating immune-cell trafficking.",
