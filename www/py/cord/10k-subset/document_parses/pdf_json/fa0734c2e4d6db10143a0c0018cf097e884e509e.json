            "text": "It is now well recognised that cardiac events occur relatively commonly in patients with acute community-acquired pneumonia. While these events are more frequent in patients with underlying risk factors-such as those with underlying chronic cardiovascular and respiratory comorbidities, the elderly, and in nursing home residents-they also occur in patients with no underlying risks other than severe pneumonia. Recent research elucidating the underlying pathogenic mechanisms related to these cardiac events has indicated a probable role for platelet activation, which is possibly exacerbated by pneumolysin in the case of pneumococcal infections. This, in turn, has resulted in the identification of possible therapeutic strategies targeting platelet activation, as well as the cardio-toxic activity of pneumolysin. These issues represent the primary focus of the current review.",

            "text": "For a considerable period of time, investigators have been reporting on the occurrence of cardiac events in patients with acute respiratory tract infections, including community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [1, 2] . Among these cardiac events are acute coronary syndromes (acute myocardial infarction [AMI]), acute or worsening cardiac arrhythmias and new or worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) [2] . The features of the association between acute coronary events and arrhythmias and CAP appear to fulfill the criteria for causality-namely, that pneumonia is a cause of these events; whereas, in the case of CHF, it appears the cause-effect relationship may be bidirectional [2] . More recent studies are beginning to give insight into the magnitude of this problem, also indicating that these events tend to be particularly common early on during the course of CAP, and also tend to be more common in patients with certain risk factors, including older age, nursing home residence, pre-existing cardiovascular disease, and in more severe pneumonia [2] . Nevertheless, it is important to recognise that in up to 50 % of cases with CAP in which acute cardiac complications occur, there has been no prior history of overt chronic cardiac disease [3] .",

Furthermore, cardiovascular events (CVEs) are recognised to be the primary causes of clinical failure in patients with CAP and should be actively looked for in patients not responding to standard medical care [6] . Importantly, it is now recognised that acute cardiac events occurring during the course of CAP are associated with negative impacts on both short-term and long-term outcomes [2, 6] . This article will review the clinical studies of cardiac events in patients with CAP, describe the likely pathogenic mechanisms involved in this interaction, and discuss possible therapeutic and preventative strategies to manage these events, particularly in pneumococcal CAP.",

In addition to recording demographic, clinical, microbiological, laboratory, and outcome data, they also performed electrocardiographic (ECG) and echocardiographic investigations and measured serum enzyme, including cardiac enzyme levels (creatinine kinase [CK], CK-MB fraction, and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]). A number of ECG changes were documented, which returned to normal after a mean of 2 days in survivors. The so-called S1, Q3, T3 pattern on ECG was associated with CK-MB leak, hypoxia and a high Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS). The presence of P pulmonale, right axis deviation and clockwise rotation correlated with hypoxia and high SAPS score. Clockwise rotation also correlated with raised serum LDH and CK-MB levels and high pulmonary artery pressures. The overall patient mortality was 10.8 % and a number of negative prognostic factors were documented. While there was no association between the ECG changes and mortality, raised LDH, CK and CK-MB levels correlated, among other factors, with need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality.",

            "text": "More recently, a number of investigators have studied long-term cardiovascular complications of CAP [18] [19] [20] [21] . In one investigation adult patients with CAP initially hospitalised in a tertiary hospital were followed up for 1 year, post-discharge [18] . Overall, 93/1,284 (7.2 %) patients died within 1 year of hospital discharge (68 [73.1 %] in the first 6 months). The main reasons for mortality were infectious diseases, mainly pneumonia, and acute CVEs. A number of risk factors were noted, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, cancer, and dementia, which could help identify cases at high risk of long-term mortality. Another study documented cardiac complications (sometimes more than one) in 55/310 (18 %) hospitalised CAP patients, which included AMI or a new episode of atrial fibrillation in 32 and 30 patients, respectively [19] . However, during the follow-up, 89 patients died (51 % of whom had experienced an in-hospital cardiac complication, versus 26 % who had not; p < 0.001); in addition, 73 had a CVE (47 % of patients who had experienced an inhospital cardiac event, versus 19 % who had not; p < 0.001). Among other factors, in-hospital cardiac events were significantly associated with both overall mortality and CVEs during follow-up. A third study in elderly patients with CAP (\u226565 years) [20] documented the occurrence of new onset of heart failure in both the intermediate and long-term (even after 5 years) following hospitalisation, which had not been present on hospital admission. These same authors confirmed in an additional study [21] that hospitalisation for CAP is associated with both short-term and long-term risk of cardiovascular disease and while the risk of cardiovascular disease was greatest in the first year following hospitalisation, it remained higher than in controls for up to 10 years of follow-up.",

Among the 17 articles (68 %) that had reported on in-patient cohorts of CAP, data extracted from appropriate studies indicated that incidence rate of overall cardiac complications was 17.7 %, heart failure was 14.1 % (range 7-33 %), acute coronary syndromes was 5.3 % (range 1-11 %) and cardiac arrhythmias was 4.7 % (range 1--11 %). Major conclusions from this analysis were that cardiac complications were common in patients with CAP and needed to be better appreciated by physicians and patients alike, with early recognition and appropriate management. Furthermore, the investigators indicated the need for a better understanding of pathogenic mechanisms, of risk factors, and of the impact of these cardiac events on patient outcome. In addition, as indicated by these and other investigators, there needs to be a better understanding of interventions to treat these complications (e.g. with the use of cardioprotective medications), as well as to prevent them (e.g. with use of influenza virus and pneumococcal vaccination) [26] . Possible therapeutic and preventative strategies, preceded by a brief overview of current concepts in pathogenesis including the role of pneumolysin in CAP-associated CVEs, are discussed in more detail below.",

Notwithstanding disease severity and heart ejection fraction, significant predictors of myocardial infarction included elevated concentrations of the circulating biomarkers of platelet activation, soluble CD40 ligand, P-selectin (CD62P) and thromboxane B2 (a surrogate for thromboxane A2), as well as the mean platelet volume [28] . The contention that platelet activation plays a pivotal role in orchestrating inflammatory events which trigger, or more likely exacerbate, vascular damage and dysfunction is supported by the steadily increasing recognition of the critical role played by these cells in mediating inflammatory and immune responses [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] .",

These effects, which were observed at pathologically relevant concentrations of the toxin, were dependent on its cholesterol-binding, pore-forming activity and unrelated to interaction with TLR4 [39] . In this context, it is noteworthy that PAF has been reported to contribute significantly to pneumolysin-induced lung injury in a murine model of experimental infection [40] . We have also observed that pneumolysin, also at pathologically relevant concentrations, activates platelets directly, according to upregulated surface expression of the adhesion molecule CD62P, a constituent of platelet \u03b1-granules. This pro-adhesive mechanism, which favours the binding of platelets to both neutrophils and vascular endothelium, was also dependent on the pore-forming activity of pneumolysin [41] .",

These injurious effects on the myocardium were mimicked by intravenous administration of recombinant pneumolysin, but not by a mutant toxin devoid of pore-forming activity, and were attenuated by co-administration of pneumolysinsequestering liposomes [46] . Mechanistically, exposure of murine cardiomyocytes to sublytic concentrations of the toxin resulted in intense calcium influx and overload followed by membrane depolarisation [46] , as previously reported for human neutrophils [47] .

These findings were not, however, confirmed in a large multicentre, international observational study (n = 3,855 patients) focused on the potential benefit of prehospitalisation administration of aspirin on development of ALI following hospital admission [54] . Although univariate analysis revealed a reduced incidence of ALI in patients receiving aspirin therapy (OR 0.65; p = 0.010), this protective effect was attenuated using propensity score analysis (OR 0.70; p = 0.072) [54] . Nonetheless, the authors conceded that prospective intervention trials were justified. In this context, a recently published study [55] , albeit involving a relatively small number of patients with ARDS (n = 202) admitted to a single medical and surgical ICU over an 18-month period, is noteworthy.

The risk for development of cardiac complications is highest soon after diagnosis with about 90 % of these events detected within 7 days and more than half within the first 24 h. Mortality attributable to CAP-related cardiovascular abnormalities may be associated with pre-existing plaque formation (AMI, predominantly silent) or to unrelated causes (arrhythmias), the former being more common. The major risk factors include older age, nursing home residence, severity of CAP, chronic cardiovascular and respiratory comorbidities and smoking. Although most evident in the acute phase of CAP, it is, however, noteworthy that the risk for development of new-onset heart failure in elderly adults previously hospitalised for CAP extends to 1 year, albeit at a lower rate, remaining evident up to 10 years after initial diagnosis. This includes patients who had previously experienced and survived intra-hospital CAPrelated cardiac complications. In this context, CVEs have been reported to account for more than 30 % of deaths at long-term follow-up averaging 1-5.4 years, possibly due to CAP-related exacerbation, as well as possibly persistence of the inflammatory mechanisms described above. Promising therapeutic strategies include those targeting platelet activation, especially aspirin. In the case of pneumococcal CAP, macrolides, statins and cholesterol-loaded liposomes interfere with the production or bioactivity of pneumolysin, while new generation vaccines offer the prospect of prevention.
