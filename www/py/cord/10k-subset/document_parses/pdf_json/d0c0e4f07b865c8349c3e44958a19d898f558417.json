            "text": "Critically ill patients with respiratory infections have been the continued focus of investigation over the last several years. Infections, mostly nosocomial, are a major cause of mortality in hospitalized patients related to an increased risk of infection with multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens and the widespread use of indiscriminate broad-spectrum antibiotics. The frequency and epidemiology of MDR pathogens show regional variation, however, with several studies pointing out that the risk of MDR pathogens in healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) is variable and hence there is a need for accurate risk scoring in this category of patients. Obtaining meaningful data and monitoring trends of preventative strategies have become ever more important, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently publishing new surveillance definitions. Newer biomarkers are becoming part of the increasing armamentarium in the field of critical care medicine and antibiotic stewardship using biomarkers has been studied robustly. Antibiotic use in the critically ill, with dosing to attain better pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results, was part of several research studies. We summarize the findings from the major clinical research studies published in 2013 on respiratory infections, with a focus on infections in critically ill patients.",

The past decade has seen increased awareness in recognizing patients with sepsis and several guidelines, including the 'Surviving Sepsis Campaign' , have published a detailed framework on the approach to patients with severe sepsis. In a large, prospective, French, multicenter, observational study as part of the EPISS study cohort, investigators examined the epidemiology of septic shock in 1,495 patients [1] . In this study, 53.6% of patients had respiratory tract infection as the cause of septic shock and 83.9% required invasive mechanical ventilation (MV), with Gram-negative bacilli being the most common pathogens identified. Although most patients received initial appropriate antibiotic therapy (n = 898), the in-hospital mortality rate was still high, up to 48.7%. A higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, age and chronic health status score and the presence of immunosuppression were independent risk factors for short-term mortality. In a follow-up study of the same cohort of patients, 3-month mortality was 52.2%. Severity of illness, indicated by a higher SOFA score early after septic shock, impacted mortality the most, while co-morbid conditions such as cirrhosis, nosocomial infection and age influenced mortality after hospitalization [2] .",

Respiratory infection was the most common cause of sepsis in both groups, and a lung source was determined as the primary cause of sepsis more often in patients with a negative culture than in patients with a positive culture (74.5% versus 59.9, P <0.001). Of all the pathogens identified, infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) was associated with increased mortality (odds ratio (OR) 2.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 3.79, P = 0.03). Patients with culture-negative sepsis had fewer comorbidities; these patients were more often women and had lower severity of illness than those with culture-positive sepsis. Although patients with positive culture had higher mortality, it was not an independent predictor of mortality on logistic regression analysis. Sakr and colleagues [4] studied the influence of gender on 3,902 patients with severe sepsis and found the frequency of severe sepsis and septic shock was lower in women than in men (6.0% versus 8.9%, P = 0.001) and the overall ICU mortality was not different in both sexes (20.1% versus 19.8%, P = 0.834). In the subset of patients with severe sepsis, however, female patients had worse survival than men (63.5% versus 46.4%, P = 0.007). Further studies on the impact of gender-specific hormonal and immunologic profile differences may uncover an explanation for these findings.",

In a study including 5,888 participants, the authors tested the hypothesis that a bidirectional relationship exists between pneumonia and dementia, with subclinical changes in cognition increasing the risk of pneumonia hospitalization and an accelerated decline in cognitive dysfunction occurring after pneumonia [5] . Three trajectories were identified longitudinally based on Teng's modified mini mental state examination -no decline, minimal decline and severe decline. A low cognitive score prior to hospitalization increased the risk of pneumonia -a 10 point lower modified mini mental state score increased the hazard of pneumonia by 8.4%. Patients who had at least one episode of pneumonia had a higher risk of developing subsequent dementia than those without pneumonia (hazards ratio 2.24, 95% CI 1.62 to 3.11, P = 0.01). Of the total population, 6.8% had severe sepsis and similar cognitive decline as was seen with pneumonia. Neurotoxicity related to elevated cytokine levels and other co-morbid conditions with severe illness, such as delirium, could be a plausible explanation for the cognitive decline. However, the population in this study who developed pneumonia were slightly older and had abnormal scores on mini mental state examination and potentially were identified earlier in their course with longitudinal screening.",

Reignier and associates [6] in a randomized, non-inferiority, open-label, multicenter trial studied whether GRV monitoring every 6 hours and adjusting enteral feeding rates if the volume exceeded 250 ml would prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). In this study, there was no difference in VAP incidence between patients who had GRV measured (n = 227) compared with the group (n = 222) who did not (16.7% versus 15.8%), and all the clinical outcomes, including mortality, were similar in both groups. Patients in whom GRV was not measured had a higher incidence of vomiting, but also a higher proportion of this group achieved the calorie target and had lower use of prokinetic agents. Although the study was done well, it was underpowered to determine the harmful effects related to vomiting and included mostly patients in the medical ICU and excluded patients with gastrointestinal bleeding. In a meta-analysis of 19 randomized controlled trials including 1,394 patients, Alhazzani and colleagues [7] reviewed the risk of pneumonia in patients receiving small bowel feeding compared to gastric feeding. Small bowel feeding was associated with reduced risk of pneumonia (relative risk 0.70, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.90, P = 0.004), but there was no difference in mortality, ventilator days or ICU length of stay (LOS) between the two groups. The study is limited, however, because the individual trials had small sample sizes, included severe pancreatitis patients and patients not in the ICU and used variable definitions of pneumonia. Insertion of the small bowel feeding tube can be technically difficult if done blindly and may need additional training with fluoroscopy and endoscopy procedures. Even though oropharyngeal bacterial translocation seems a likely cause of the development of VAP, it is unclear if monitoring gastric reserve volume or advancing the feeding tube to the small intestine clearly prevents VAP. Another identified risk factor for ventilator-associated respiratory infection (including VAP and ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis) is iatrogenic immune suppression (OR 3.34), a risk factor that has frequently been excluded in prior studies [8] .",

The readmission rate was 19.3% (n = 149) within the 30-day period and was related to non-pneumonia causes such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (25%) and congestive heart failure (CHF) (22%). While pneumonia accounted for only 7.4% (n = 11) of readmissions, patients with HCAP were re-admitted more often than those with communityacquired pneumonia (CAP) (24.4% versus 4.1%, P <0.001) and had more comorbid conditions. The four independent variables associated with readmission on logistic regression analysis were long-term care admission prior to index hospitalization (OR = 2.15, P = 0.001), immunosuppressed state (OR = 1.93, P = 0.001), previous antibiotics (OR = 1.74, P = 0.009) and previous 90-day hospitalization (OR = 1.66, P = 0.014).

Plasma kallistatin and antithrombin III were significantly lower on days 1 and 4 in patients who did not survive (24%) compared to those who did, possibly indicating greater consumption of these factors in the severely ill. The plasma kallistatin levels were significantly reduced in patients with septic shock and in those who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A cutoff level of day 1 kallistatin <6.5 \u03bcg/ml can discriminate between survivors and non-survivors with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.683, P = 0.04 ( Figure 1 ). Thus, decreased plasma kallistatin level on day 1 of ICU admittance is independently associated with mortality and severity of disease in CAP patients in this study. In a multicenter, case-control study, Masson and colleagues [11] compared presepsin and PCT levels in 50 survivors and 50 nonsurvivors who were admitted to ICU with severe sepsis. The presepsin levels were significantly higher on day 1 of enrollment in patients who died compared with survivors and remained significantly elevated on day 7 as well. Presepsin was independently associated with short-term ICU and 28-day mortality and had good prognostic accuracy similar to the SOFA score for long-term mortality at 90 days. PCT on the other hand was not related to mortality and the levels declined on day 7 in both survivors and non-survivors.",

If the PCT was negative, however, the finding was good for ruling out infection in class IV CHF patients (negative predictive value of 89).

The lack of reduction in VAP and VAC incidence could have been due to continuous quality improvement interventions that were already underway prior to guideline implementation, but interestingly the newer ventilator-associated event definitions did not recognize VAP in all patients, similar to findings from the studies by Muscedere and colleagues [15] and Hayashi and colleagues [16] discussed above.",

Eighty-three patients had VAP and the ETA and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures had concordance in only 52 culture pairs. Sensitivity for ETA to predict a BAL-obtained pathogen was 62.4% (78/125 microorganisms cultured) and was better if done within 3 days of VAP onset and in recurrent VAP. Antibiotic decisions made according to the ATS/IDSA guidelines led to appropriate therapy in 97.9% of patients compared with 77.4% based on ETA culture, with fewer antibiotic days using the ETA-based culture. Hence, using a strategy for VAP diagnosis and treatment decisionmaking based on ETA cultures alone could result in inappropriate therapy but possibly helps with de-escalation and leads to fewer antibiotic days.",

In a study including 519 patients with CAP and 419 with HCAP, the authors compared the performance of Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) and CURB-65 risk scores for predicting 30-day mortality [20] . HCAP patients were sicker, had more frequent ICU admission, longer length of ICU stay and higher mortality than CAP patients in this cohort. The discriminatory power for 30-day mortality, using both PSI and CURB-65, was lower in HCAP patients than CAP patients (AUC for PSI = 0.679, CURB-65 = 0.599 in HCAP group versus AUC for PSI = 0.835, CURB 65 = 0.79; P = 0.009). Thus, both scoring systems were less effective for predicting mortality in HCAP than in CAP patients, but if used, the PSI scoring system performed better than CURB-65. In a prospective study including 1,413 patients (887 CAP and 526 HCAP), Shindo and associates [21] determined the risk factors for pathogens resistant to macrolides, beta-lactams and respiratory fluoroquinolones (CAP-DRPs). HCAP patients had a higher frequency of CAP-DRPs than CAP patients (26.6% versus 8.6%) and a higher 30-day mortality rate (20.3% versus 7.0%). Independent risk factors for CAP-DRPs were similar in both CAP and HCAP groups, and included prior hospitalization, immunosuppression, previous antibiotic use, gastric acid-suppressive agents, tube feeding, and non-ambulatory status. The higher the number of risk factors, the greater the chance of CAP-DRPs (AUC 0.79, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.84). They also identified risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which included dialysis within 30 days, prior MRSA isolation within the past 90 days, antibiotics in the past 90 days, and gastric acid-suppressive therapy. However, the presence of a high frequency of resistant pathogens in this study group limits generalization and further studies are needed for external validity of the model.",

The prevalence of MDR pathogens was 7.6% in Barcelona and 3.3% in Edinburgh and the two scores performed consistently better than the traditional HCAP classification in both centers. Maruyama and colleagues [23] , in a prospective study of 425 patients (CAP = 124, HCAP = 321), applied a therapeutic algorithm based on the presence of MDR risk factors (immunosuppression, hospitalization within the last 90 days, poor functional status indicated by a Barthel Index score <50, and antibiotic therapy within the past 6 months) and severity of illness (need for ICU admission or requiring MV) to determine its impact on outcomes. HCAP patients with no or one risk factor were treated with CAP therapy and those with two or more risk factors were treated with a hospital acquired pneumonia regimen based on the ATS/IDSA 2005 guidelines. HCAP patients with two or more risk factors had a higher incidence of MDR pathogens and higher mortality than CAP patients (27.1% versus 2%, P <0.001, and 13.7% versus 5.6%, P = 0.017, respectively). Although only 53% of HCAP patients received broad-spectrum antibiotics, using the algorithm the majority (92.9%) received appropriate therapy for the identified pathogens. Thus, using this approach, broad-spectrum antibiotic use can be limited, even in patients with HCAP. Lacroix and associates [24] investigated the role of early fiberoptic bronchoscopeguided distal protected small volume bronchoalveolar lavage (mini-BAL) in 54 HCAP patients. Mini-BAL helped identify causative pathogens more efficiently than blood culture (46.3% versus 11.1%, P <0.01), up to 72% in patients who did not receive prior antibiotics. Thus, a strategy based on mini-BAL might help with early identification, but the authors did not compare length of antibiotic days, development of resistance or mortality between an empiric regimen and patients who had mini-BAL. The practicality of this approach in the non-intubated HCAP population needs to be validated.",

Airway hemorrhage was more frequent in PVL-MSSA necrotizing pneumonia compared with PVL-MRSA (44.2% versus 24.1%, P = 0.056) but there was no significant difference in mortality (39.4% versus 37.9%), ICU admission, severity of disease or use of antibiotics between the two groups. Interestingly, methicillin resistance was not associated with increased mortality, but patients with airway hemorrhage had a three-fold increase in 7-and 30-day mortality (OR 3.75 and 3.68, respectively) and patients treated with an anti-toxin regimen (clindamycin, linezolid, or rifampicin) had a better chance of survival (mortality rate 6.1% versus 52.3%, P <0.001) even though the timing of therapy was not available. This study is one of the largest series on necrotizing community-acquired staphylococcal infection and shows that, despite the resistance pattern, PVL-associated S. aureus infection can be a severe disease with high mortality in young patients from the community and that the use of anti-toxin therapy in suspected patients is associated with a potential survival advantage.",

Muscedere and colleagues [27] evaluated the risk of coexistent or secondarily acquired bacterial respiratory tract or bloodstream-positive cultures in 681 patients with influenza A (H1N1) infection during the 2009 outbreak. They noted that 38% of patients (n = 259) had at least a positive blood or respiratory culture during their ICU stay (29.7% had co-existent and 44.4% had ICU-acquired infection; 15.4% had both) despite almost all patients receiving antibiotics. Patients with any positive culture had higher morbidity with more days on the ventilator, longer ICU and hospital LOS and higher hospital mortality (24.7% versus 19.9%, P = 0.15). The interesting finding from this study is that influenza infection (H1N1) is not as mild as previously thought; the majority of ICU patients required MV and the morbidity and mortality were high even in patients without bacterial co-infection. Hung and colleagues [28] in a double-blind, randomized controlled trial evaluated the use of hyperimmune IV immunoglobulin (H-IVIG) fractionated from convalescent plasma of patients who had 2009 H1N1 infection (n = 17) versus normal IV immunoglobulin (n = 18) in 35 patients with severe H1N1 infection. Patients who received H-IVIG had significantly lower viral loads post-treatment and, if treatment was given within 5 days of onset, had mortality benefit (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.92, P = 0.04). Although the study is limited by a relatively small sample size, the H1N1 antibody present in the convalescent H-IVIG, if used early, offers potential benefit in the treatment of H1N1 infection.",

Late-onset VAP patients had a higher overall frequency of Gram-negative pathogens (84.3% versus 75.4%, P = 0.02) and more significant antibiotic exposure in the prior month (85.5% versus 68.5%, P <0.01).

The presence of severe sepsis/septic shock (OR = 3.7) and pneumonia that developed in a center with greater than a 25% prevalence of resistant pathogens (OR = 11.3) was independently associated with the presence of resistant pathogens in group 1 patients.

Forty-two cases (38%) involved MDR PA, and 9 (8.1%) were colistin-only susceptible PA. The initial antimicrobial regimen was inadequate in 56 patients (50.9%) and more often inadequate among those with MDR PA. Patients who had initial inappropriate antibiotics had a higher mortality than those who had appropriate therapy (64.2% versus 24.7%, P = 0.001) and MDR PA patients treated with empiric combination therapy had a lower risk of initial inappropriate antibiotics than those treated with monotherapy. In a similar study, Pena and colleagues [32] looked at the impact of MDR in 91 patients with PA VAP, of which 60 cases were caused by MDR strains, 42 (70%) of which were extensively drug-resistant. As with the previous study, VAP patients with susceptible PA received adequate empiric antibiotic coverage more often, both empiric and definitive, than patients with MDR pathogens (68% versus 30%, P <0.001). Although inadequate antibiotics were an independent risk factor for early mortality (OR 4.27, P = 0.052) and patients with susceptible strains had more adequate coverage, those with inadequate therapy had a higher mortality that could be related to severity of illness more than to resistance. The OUTCOMEREA data on PA pneumonias include 393 PA-VAP episodes with multi-drug resistance defined as resistance to two antibiotics (piperacillin, ceftazidime, imipenem, colistin, and fluoroquinolones) [33] . MDR was not related to treatment failure or relapses but was associated with longer ICU LOS. Fluoroquinolone use prior to the first episode was associated with increased risk of treatment failure probably related to the induction of resistance, but when used in the treatment regimen, fluoroquinolones decreased the risk of treatment failure. In another study of 143 confirmed pseudomonal pneumonia patients, serotypes O6 and O11 were more prevalent, but mortality was higher with O1 (40%) and lower with O2 (0%); clinical resolution tended to be better with O2 (82%) compared with other serotypes.

In a prospective observational study, Esperatti and colleagues [35] determined the usefulness of a set of predictors of adverse outcomes (PAOs) in 355 ICU-acquired pneumonia patients and determined their correlation with serum inflammatory markers and clinical prognostic scores. The PAOs were determined 72 to 96 hours after starting antibiotics (evolutionary criteria), and were considered positive if there was: 1) no improvement in partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio since the onset of pneumonia and in the absence of other causes of worsening oxygenation; 2) requirement for intubation despite antibiotics for 24 hours; 3) persistence of fever or hypothermia together with purulent secretions; 4) a 50% or greater increase in pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph; 5) development of septic shock or multi-organ dysfunction not present on day 1. Fifty percent of patients had at least one PAO, and had a higher 28-day mortality (45% versus 19%, P = 0.001), less mean ventilator-free days (10 versus 12, P = 0.001) and elevated serum inflammatory markers such as PCT and C-reactive protein compared with those who did not have any PAOs. The trend remained significant in patients who developed VAP, as well as those who had nonventilator ICU-acquired pneumonia. The failure to improve oxygenation (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/ fraction of inspired oxygen) and a worsening SOFA score over 5 days were independently associated with mortality in a multivariate analysis.",

They found no significant difference in 60-day mortality between patients who had dual therapy compared to monotherapy, and in those who received dual therapy, there was no survival advantage between the macrolide and fluoroquinolone subgroups (subdistribution hazard ratio 1.45, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.70, P = 0.24).

Further, subgroup analysis did not reveal a survival benefit even in patients with septic shock or Streptococcus pneumoniae infection receiving dual therapy, but dual therapy did not increase the development of MDR pathogens or nosocomial pneumonia. In a similar study including 3,203 hospitalized patients, guideline concordant therapy (defined as macrolides/\u03b2-lactams or respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy) did not have a mortality benefit compared with discordant therapy, but a composite endpoint of death or ICU admission was lower in the concordant group (14.7% versus 29.0%; adjusted OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.54, P <0.0001) [37] .

Extended infusion of antibiotics with a time-dependent killing mechanism, such as beta-lactams, has been proposed as a means to overcome the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) alterations in severely ill patients in order to optimize the time that drug concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the target organism. Carlier and colleagues [38] studied the effect of augmented renal clearance on extended infusion of meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam (Pip/Tazo) in 61 patients with sepsis and normal creatinine clearance [38] . Patients received a loading dose (1 g for meropenem and 4.5 g for Pip/Tazo) followed by extended infusion usually over 3 hours every 6 hours for Pip/Tazo and 8 hours for meropenem. Only 55% of patients achieved a predefined PK/PD target, and of patients who had augmented renal clearance (48%), the majority did not achieve the target (76%). Augmented renal clearance with a clearance >130 ml/ minute was an independent predictor of not achieving the PK/PD target, but the study was not designed to look at outcome and treatment failures, and the PK/PD target may have been set too high. Dulhunty and colleagues [39] , in a double-blind randomized controlled trial, compared continuous versus intermittent bolus dosing of Pip/Tazo, meropenem, and ticarcillin-clavulanate in 60 patients with severe sepsis. Patients in the intervention arm received active infusion and placebo boluses and controls received placebo infusion and active boluses. The concentration exceeded the MIC more often in the intervention group than in controls (81.8% versus 28.6%, P = 0.001; most with meropenem and least with ticarcillinclaculanate) and the patients in the intervention group had a higher clinical cure rate, but there was no difference in ICU or hospital LOS or mortality. The study reinforces the dosing options available for critically ill patients based on PK characteristics, but did not have the statistical power to determine a mortality benefit, although there was a trend towards better survival in the intervention arm.",

In a study of 63 patients with severe sepsis (50% with lung infection) requiring amikacin, investigators used therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustments to optimize serum concentration [40] . Microbiological eradication and clinical cure were higher in patients who achieved initial optimal Cpeak/MIC and were proportionately higher with higher target concentration. Patients who achieved the target concentration after 3 days had a worse clinical cure and microbiological eradication than those who achieved this goal on the first day.

Outside the hospital, there are patients who develop HCAP and many of these are also at risk for MDR pathogens. New studies have suggested strategies to identify patients at risk for resistant pathogen infection, and therapies that optimize efficacy, without the overuse of broad-spectrum therapy. The optimal therapy of MDR pathogens is being explored, but for MRSA CAP, the use of anti-toxin therapy may improve outcome. In VAP, the role of resistance in determining outcome is uncertain, but most studies suggest an interaction between drug susceptibility and disease severity. Optimizing the therapy of MDR pathogens is being explored in a number of ways, including the use of modified dosing regimens, and inhaled antibiotics for pneumonia.
