            "text": "The aerosol form of the bacterium Yersinia pestis causes the pneumonic plague, a rapidly fatal disease. At present, no plague vaccines are available for use in the United States. One candidate for the development of a subunit vaccine is the Y. pestis virulence (V) antigen, a protein that mediates the function of the Yersinia outer protein virulence factors and suppresses inflammato y responses in the host. On the basis of the knowledge that adenovirus (Ad) gene-transfer vectors act as adjuvants in eliciting host immunity against the transgene they carry, we tested the hypothesis that a single administration of a replication-defective Ad genetransfer vector encoding the Y. pestis V antigen (AdsecV) could stimulate strong protective immune responses without a requirement for repeat administration. AdsecV elicited specifi T cell responses and high IgG titers in serum within 2 weeks after a single intramuscular immunization. Importantly, the mice were protected from a lethal intranasal challenge of Y. pestis CO92 from 4 weeks up to 6 months after immunization with a single intramuscular dose of AdsecV. These observations suggest that an Ad gene-transfer vector expressing V antigen is a candidate for development of an effective anti-plague vaccine.",

            "text": "At present, no plague vaccines are available in the United States. Several vaccines have been developed, including killed whole-cell formulations and the live attenuated EV76 vaccine [5] [6] [7] [8] . Although these vaccines have been used in humans, they offer low levels of protection, have numerous adverse side effects, and require frequent immunizations with consequent prolonged time to develop immunity [5] [6] [7] [8] . A promising subunit vaccine is based on the virulence (V) antigen (also referred to as \"LcrV\") [9] [10] [11] . V antigen is a 37-kDa multifunctional protein of Yersinia species encoded by the 70-kb low calcium response (lcr) plasmid. V antigen participates in the type III secretion system in Y. pestis regulating the production and facilitating the translocation of Yersinia outer proteins (Yops) with anti-host activity into the host cell [12, 13] . Active immunization with purifie V antigen or passive immunization with antiserum against V antigen provides protection against plague in mice [9, 10, 14, 15] . V antigen-based DNA vaccines are also being developed [16, 17] . These vaccines elicit low antibody titers, and protection against a Y. pestis challenge is reached only after several immunizations [18] .",

Ad vectors are excellent candidates for vaccine platforms as they transfer genes effectively to antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in vivo, with consequent activation of APCs, thus conveying immune adjuvant properties and inducing strong, rapid humoral and cellular immune responses against the transgene product [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . On the basis of these considerations, we constructed an E1 \u03ea E3 \u03ea Ad-based vaccine vector that encodes a secreted human codonoptimized V antigen (AdsecV). The data demonstrate that AdsecV induces high IgG titers within 2 weeks after a single intramuscular immunization in mice. Importantly, mice immunized with a single intramuscular dose of AdsecV are protected from a lethal intranasal challenge of Y. pestis.",

Absorbance at 415 nm was read using a microplate reader (BioRad Laboratories). Classspecifi anti-IgG antibodies (IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3) were determined using the Mouse Typer isotyping panel (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Antibody titers were calculated on the basis of a log(optical density) \u03ea log(dilution) interpolation model and a cutoff value equal to 2-fold the absorbance of the background [30, 31] .",

Several virulence factors have been identifie as possible vaccine candidates, but the most promising are the V antigen and the F1 protein [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [32] [33] [34] . Antibodies against V and F1 confer protection against both bubonic and pneumonic plague in mice, guinea pigs, and nonhuman primates [9-11, 14, 15, 33, 35] . Recent studies have shown that a single intramuscular immunization with both recombinant antigens delivered with adjuvants and combined in a molar ratio of 2:1 (F1:V antigen) protected mice against an aerosol challenge with Y. pestis [10, 11, [36] [37] [38] [39] . Although this protection was correlated with high IgG levels [40] , it has been suggested that nonhumoral immune responses also participate, because immunized IL-4-deficien mice, which do not mount effective humoral immune responses, have been shown to be protected against plague [41] . Also, immunization with the combined subunits failed to protect signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) 4 \u03ea/\u03ea mice against plague; Stat 4 \u03ea/\u03ea mice are diminished in their capacity to mount type 1 cytokine responses [42] . It was shown recently that cellular immunity in the absence of antibody can protect against pulmonary Y. pestis infection; transfer of Y. pestis-primed T cells to naive B cell-deficien mMT mice protected the mice against a Y. pestis challenge [43] .",

The correlation with high IgG titers and protection of immunodeficien SCID/Beige mice against pneumonic plague by passive transfer of anti-V antigen-specifi immune serum [14, 15, 51] suggests that anti-V antigen antibodies play a significan role. It has been shown that anti-V antigen antibody administered during infections of mice with Y. pestis restore the production of TNF-a and IFNg [49] , and in vitro assays have shown that anti-V antigen antibodies can partially block the delivery of Yops (and the consequent downstream effects of Yops) in infected macrophage-like cells [52] . Thus, the protection conferred by a V antigen vaccine might be achieved by opsonization through antibody association with surface V antigen on Y. pestis, by blocking the delivery of Yops to host cells, by preventing early bacterial growth in macrophages, and/or by neutralizing the immunomodulatory activity of V antigen, allowing the host to mount an inflammato y response.",

The Ad vector itself may act as adjuvant by inducing a strong inflammato y response at the injection site and by promoting the differentiation of immature DCs into professional APCs [54] [55] [56] . Recombinant Ad vectors expressing a wide variety of pathogen-specifi genes have been used in vaccination studies in rodents, canines, and nonhuman primates [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] .

AdsecV antibody responses were elicited rapidly (within 2 weeks after administration) and showed the characteristic Th1/Th2 responses elicited by Ad vectors. Most importantly, the immune responses evoked by AdsecV were sufficien to protect immunized mice against an intranasal challenge with a fully virulent strain of Y. pestis. Together, these data suggest that AdsecV is a promising vaccine candidate for protection against plague.",
