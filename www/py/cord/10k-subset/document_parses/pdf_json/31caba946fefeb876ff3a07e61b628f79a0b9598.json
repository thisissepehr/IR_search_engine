Diseases like influenza, enteric fever and rickettsial fevers account for majority of such outbreaks. Optimal diagnostic tests to inform treatment decisions are not available at the point-ofcare. A proper epidemiological and clinical characterization of such outbreaks is important for appropriate treatment and control efforts. Methods: An investigation was initiated as a response to increased presentation of patients at Patan Hospital from Chalnakhel locality in Dakchinkali municipality, Kathmandu with AUFI from June 10 to July 1, 2016. Focused group discussion with local inhabitants and the epidemiological curve of febrile patients at local primary health care centre confirmed the outbreak. The household-survey was conducted in the area with questionnaire administered on patients to characterize their illnesses and their medical records were reviewed. A different set of questionnaire was administered on the patients and controls to investigate the association with common risk factors. Water samples were collected and analyzed microbiologically. Results: Eighty one patients from 137 households suffered from febrile illness within 6 weeks window before the investigation. All the 67 sampled patients with acute fever had a generalized illness without a discernible focus of infection. Only 38% of the patients had received a clinical diagnosis while the rest were treated empirically without a diagnosis. Three patients had blood culture confirmed enteric fever. Forty-two (63%) patients had been administered antibiotics, most commonly, ofloxacin, cefixime or azithromycin with a mean fever clearance time of 4 days. There was no definite association between several risk factors and fever. Fecal contamination was noted in tap water samples. Conclusion: Based on the pattern of illness, this outbreak was most likely a mixture of self-limiting viral infections and enteric fever. This study shows that even in the absence of a confirmed diagnosis, a detailed characterization of the illness at presentation and the recovery course can suggest the diagnosis and help in formulating appropriate recommendation for treatment and control.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Fever is a common presentation in district hospitals and primary health facilities of developing countries [1] .

In the absence of reliable point-of-care diagnostic tests to differentiate the aetiology in resource poor settings, 'fever' itself is established as a diagnosis rather than a symptom and treated empirically with antimicrobials [2] .

The delayed response to antimicrobial therapy points out to more serious infection, inappropriate antimicrobial therapy and/or potential antimicrobial resistance to the administered drug. The early antimicrobial response is generally obtained in patients when the bacterial illness is susceptible to the administered antimicrobial or in patients with self-limiting viral illness where antimicrobial was empirically administered in the line of enteric fever which is one of the major causes of AUFI in this setting. The assumption of an outbreak of a mixture of viral and bacterial infection was supported by the findings of greatly variable duration of fever and associated symptoms, variation in fever clearance times after antimicrobial treatment, non-uniformity in the response to treatment and spontaneous recovery without treatment in a subset of patients. Self-limiting air borne viral influenza A infections, and food and water borne bacterial infections including Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi A are endemic in the study setting and exhibit similar seasonality, with the peak incidence coinciding during the monsoon seasons [7, 14] .
