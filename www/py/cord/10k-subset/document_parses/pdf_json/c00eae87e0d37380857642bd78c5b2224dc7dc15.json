            "text": "T he majority of current vaccines are thought to prevent disease through the induction of a protective antibody response 1, 2 . For elicitation of protective humoral immunity by vaccination, B cells must be activated, enter germinal centers to undergo affinity maturation of their antigen receptors and then differentiate into either long-lived plasma cells that secrete antibody constitutively or memory B cells that participate in a recall response on re-exposure to the pathogen. Adjuvants help drive these immunological mechanisms, shaping vaccine protection 3, 4 . The most prevalent adjuvant in licensed human vaccines is also one of the oldest known adjuvants, aluminum hydroxide (alum). The function of alum is complex and potentially dependent on induction of inflammatory cell death at the injection site, activation of innate immunesensing pathways and production of chemokines and cytokines at the injection site and/or draining lymph nodes (LNs) [5] [6] [7] . Although effective in many vaccines, immune responses elicited by alum are often weaker than other adjuvants in clinical and preclinical studies [8] [9] [10] . Despite these limitations, the rigorous requirements for safety in vaccines make the successful development of new adjuvants a major challenge and alum remains an important gold standard benchmark for all adjuvants 7 .",

            "text": "Here we aimed to understand immunological mechanisms of action of this classic adjuvant by evaluating whether the function of alum could be enhanced by engineering the interaction between antigens and alum. Although alum is most commonly employed by adsorbing antigens to alum particles for administration, it is known that many antigens rapidly desorb from alum in the presence of serum or interstitial fluid [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Additionally, the rate of antigen clearance in vivo is often unaffected by preadsorption to alum 16, 17 . We thus designed immunogens for tight binding to alum through site-specific introduction of multivalent phosphoserine (pSer) peptide-polymer affinity tags, which undergo a ligand exchange reaction with the surface of alum to anchor immunogens in an oriented manner on alum particles. We then studied how this modification altered both the fate of these immunogens in vivo and the resulting immune responses.",

To evaluate the role of pSer valency in achieving stable binding to alum, we modified the 240 kDa fluorescent protein phycoerythrin (PE) with 2-20 linkers, where each linker contained either one or four pSer residues (Extended Data Fig. 1b) . The pSer 1or pSer 4 -modified PE was adsorbed to alum, followed by incubation in buffer containing 10% serum, and protein bound to alum after this two-step process was measured by fluorescence spectroscopy. As shown in Extended Data Fig. 1c , unmodified PE showed almost no retention on alum, but pSer tags promoted a majority of the protein to adhere to alum for >24 h. Only 2-4 pSer 4 linkers per protein were required to achieve the same level of binding as 10-20 linkers that had a single pSer residue.

The antigen eOD is a ~20 kDa gp120 engineered outer domain antigen designed to initiate priming of human B cells capable of evolving toward an important set of CD4 + -binding site-specific broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) known as VRC01-class antibodies [18] [19] [20] [21] . We first prepared eOD antigens coupled with a single peptide linker containing 1-8 phosphoserines or control linkers containing serine residues and evaluated binding to alum. In buffer, 90% of added eOD adsorbed to alum within 30 min, irrespective of peptide tag composition (Extended Data Fig. 1e ). However, when alum-adsorbed eOD was incubated in 10% serum, only ~2% of unmodified eOD or serine-modified eOD remained bound, whereas pSer-modified antigen showed increasing retention on alum with increasing pSer valency, plateauing at ~75% retention for four or more phosphoserines (Fig. 1b) .

Immunization of BALB/c mice with Ser 4 -eOD:alum or pSer-eOD:alum revealed a clear trend of increasing serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G titers as the number of phosphoserines in the affinity tag increased; pSer 8 -eOD elicited 48-fold higher serum IgG titers compared to the Ser 4 -eOD antigen, which persisted over 6 weeks (Fig. 2a,b) . The pSer-antigen:alum immunization was effective whether vaccines were administered via a subcutaneous (s.c.) or intramuscular (i.m.) route (Fig. 2c ) and we did not detect a measurable antibody response to the pSer linker itself (Extended Data Fig. 1f ). Further, ELISPOT analysis of bone marrow plasma cells 3 months after a single pSer-antigen:alum immunization showed 16-fold more antigen-specific plasma cells elicited by immunization with pSer 4 -eOD or pSer 8 -eOD compared to control Ser 4 -eOD (Fig. 2d) . Immunization with pSer-modified eOD increased total germinal center (GC) B cells compared to Sermodified eOD by 1.5-fold (Fig. 2e ,f and Extended Data Fig. 1g) . Strikingly, the percentage of eOD-binding GC B cells increased dramatically from 2.8% to 33% in response to pSer-antigen immunization (Fig. 2g ,h and Extended Data Fig. 1h ). Overall, these results indicate that pSer-immunogen:alum immunization promotes both qualitative and quantitative improvements in humoral immune responses.",

In the setting of tight binding between the immunogen and alum particles, we envisioned that antigen delivery to LNs over time could either be mediated by slow release of free antigen from alum surfaces at the site of injection or antigen could be trafficked to LNs still bound to alum nanocrystals (Extended Data Fig.  2a ). To assess the potential impact of B cells encountering antigen bound to alum particles, we measured activation of human Ramos B cells, expressing the eOD-specific germline-inferred VRC01 anti-gen receptor 20 cultured in vitro with pSer-eOD:alum conjugates versus eOD:alum. Free monomeric eOD elicited a near-baseline calcium signaling response as reported previously 20 , as did Ser 4 -eOD mixed with alum (Extended Data Fig. 2b ). By contrast, B cells stimulated by pSer-eOD:alum showed increased activation with increasing pSer valency (Extended Data Fig. 2b) . B cells incubated with alum and Ser 4 -eOD bound alum particles but showed little or no eOD uptake, whereas B cells incubated with pSer 8 -eOD:alum internalized alum particles together with eOD (Extended Data Fig.  2c,d) . Higher resolution visualization of these cells by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging revealed that nanoscale alum aggregates were internalized by B cells when pSer 8 -eOD was bound to alum (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b) . These results suggest that when bound to alum via pSer linkages, antigens can behave as a multivalent, particulate vaccine that is internalized by B cells.",

By separately labeling alum and antigen, we observed that following immunization, Ser 4 -eOD levels in the LN peaked at 24 h and rapidly decayed thereafter, whereas alum tracer slowly accumulated (Extended Data Fig.  4a -c). By contrast, pSer 8 -eOD and alum showed a matching pattern of slow accumulation in draining LNs (dLNs) (Extended Data Fig. 4d ). Macrophages took up soluble Ser 4 -eOD 1 d after immunization but antigen had cleared from these cells by 7 d. In contrast, macrophages and dendritic cells showed increased uptake of alum and pSer 8 -eOD after 7 d (Extended Data Fig. 4e -h). We also directly quantified aluminum levels in dLNs by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. As shown in Extended Data Fig. 4i , aluminum was readily detected in dLNs for both pSer 4 -eOD:alum and unmodified eOD:alum immunizations. Given these biophysical findings regarding pSerimmunogen:alum complexes, we hypothesized that alum particles might deliver pSer antigens to B cells in a multivalent form in vivo. To test this possibility, we employed an adoptive transfer model enabling tracking of antigen-specific B cells 24 . Mouse B cells expressing glVRC01 B cell receptors (BCRs) (VRC01 gHL ) were transferred into wild-type mice 24 , followed by vaccination with alum and pSer 8 -or Ser 4 -modified monomeric eOD-GT5, a variant of the eOD immunogen, with a physiological affinity (K d of ~0.3 \u00b5M) for the VRC01 gHL BCR 19, 20, 24, 25 (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 5a ). VRC01 gHL B cells in the pSer 8 -eOD-GT5:alum group acquired antigen 1 d after immunization that continued to accumulate at day 2, whereas Ser 4 -eOD-GT5:alum immunization led to nearly undetectable antigen uptake by the eOD-specific B cells (Fig. 3b,c) .

AF647 + (Ag + alum + ) VRC01 gHL B cells and AF647 -(Agalum -) VRC01 gHL B cells were analyzed independently. At 48 h, VRC01 gHL B cells from eOD-GT5:alum immunized mice exhibited almost identical gene expression profiles to naive VRC01 gHL B cells ( Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 7a,b ). In contrast, over 2,000 genes in Ag + alum + VRC01 gHL B cells were differentially expressed in pSer 8 -eOD-GT5:alum-immunized mice ( Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 7a,b) , indicative of strong activation. Gene signature analysis revealed the Ag + alum + VRC01 gHL B cells were highly metabolically active, with high levels of BCR signaling compared to VRC01 gHL B cells from conventionally immunized mice ( Fig. 4c -e). We next assessed whether the stimulatory effect of pSerimmunogen:alum particles on the B cells in vivo was restricted to BCR signaling or included other pathways. As a control for an immunization that induces activation only through the BCR, we immunized mice with a titrated dose of eOD-GT5-60mer protein nanoparticles alone 24 (Fig. 4a) . Interestingly, comparative gene signature analysis revealed selective expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen-processing and presentation genes in Ag + alum + B cells from pSer 8 -eOD-GT5:alum immunized mice (false discovery rate q = 0.006, Fig. 4e ). Single-cell RNA-seq of VRC01 gHL cells was next utilized for more refined assessment of gene expression. Differentially expressed gene clusters defining VRC01 gHL B cells from each immunization condition were identified ( Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 7c ). The transcription factor Klf2 was highly differentially expressed in Ag + alum + B cells and Klf2 is a known regulator of key genes involved in lymphocyte migration, such as Sell, Ccr7 and S1pr1. Cd83 expression was also highly increased in Ag + alum + B cells (Fig. 4f ,g and Extended Data Fig. 7d ). CD83 marks mature antigen-presenting cells and facilitates MHC class II surface expression 26 . CD83 protein was robustly upregulated on Ag + Alum + VRC01 gHL B cells from pSer-eOD:alum-immunized mice ( Fig. 7e ,f). The major co-stimulatory molecule CD86 was also upregulated (Extended Data Fig. 7g ,h).

B cells do not express inflammasomes, and deficiencies in interleukin (IL)-18 or NLRP3 did not impair IgG responses to pSer-eOD:alum immunization (Extended Data Fig. 7i ,j).

If pSer antigens are accessed by B cells while still bound to alum particles, this opens up an additional strategy for shaping the B cell response, whereby the antigen is immobilized with undesired sites oriented against the alum particle Table 2 ). The pSer 4 -MD39 trimers showed increased retention on alum following serum exposure compared to unmodified MD39 (Extended Data Fig. 9a ). IVIS imaging of fluorescent MD39:alum revealed rapid clearance of unmodified MD39 but slow decay of pSer 4 -MD39 from immunization sites (Extended Data Fig. 9b,c) . A prime and single boost of mice with MD39 mixed with alum elicited a weak trimer-specific IgG response, but pSer 4 -MD39 administered in the same regimen led to ~50-fold higher IgG titers post-boost (Fig. 6b,c) . To test whether responses with alum could further be amplified by adding accessory adjuvant compounds, we co-immunized with alum and an ISCOMs-type saponin adjuvant 30, 31 (Extended Data Fig. 9d ). Co-administration of alum together with saponin adjuvant allowed MD39 to prime measurable IgG responses following a single immunization, but alum and saponin vaccination with pSer 4 -MD39 elicited approximately tenfold higher trimer-specific titers that were maintained over time ( Fig. 6d and Extended Data Fig. 9e) . A substantially larger pool of MD39 trimer-specific memory B cells and bone marrow plasma cells were induced by pSer 4 -MD39:alum compared to control trimer:alum immunization (Extended Data Figs. 9f-i). To compare the alum:antigen-pSer platform to state-of-the-art protein nanoparticles, we immunized BALB/c mice with nanoparticle forms of MD39 or eOD with alum. The pSer-antigen immunizations elicited equivalent or slightly higher IgG titers when compared to the protein nanoparticles (Extended Data Fig. 9j,k) .",

By contrast, IgG responses in mice immunized with pSer 4 -MD39:alum were stronger and only partially reduced by addition of the base-specific mAb (Fig. 6f,g) . Furthermore, pSer 4 -MD39:alum immunization led to a significant decrease in responses to the His-tags located at the base of the Env trimer (added for protein purification purposes) when animals were immunized with pSer 4 -MD39 and increased responses to the gp120 portion of the Env trimer ( Fig. 6h and Extended Data Fig. 9l ).

The pSer-trimer:alum immunization also significantly enhanced the induction of autologous tier-2-neutralizing IgG responses, with six of six animals generating tier 2 neutralizing antibody titers at week 10 (2 weeks after boost). In contrast only 3 of 6 rabbits in the MD39:alum control group elicited neutralization at this point and mean neutralizing antibody titers for the responders were 6.5-fold lower (Fig. 6k ,l and Extended Data Fig.  9m ). To determine whether this enhanced induction of neutralization was linked to alterations in the specificity of the antibody response, we carried out TEM imaging of complexes formed between soluble MD39 Env trimer and purified IgG of the immunized animals at week 10 (ref. 32 ). This analysis revealed an antibody response dominated by base-binding IgGs in the MD39:alum group, but a more diverse response in the pSer 8 -MD39:alum group that included putative neutralization epitopes in gp120 and the gp41-gp120 interface (Fig. 6m ,n and Extended Data Fig. 10a,b) .

This approach was inspired by work of Hem and colleagues, who discovered that phosphorylated proteins were much more tightly bound to alum than antigens relying solely on electrostatic or hydrogen bonding interactions 12, 13 . Following on from these observations, several studies compared humoral responses primed by phosphorylated antigens with different levels of alum-binding affinities and found disparate conclusions, where increasing alumbinding affinity either increased, decreased or had no impact on the magnitude of the IgG response, depending on the antigen and experimental details 11, 16, 33, 34 . We suspect these conflicting findings may have resulted from the use of antigens randomly modified over the entire protein surface with alum-binding sites, which may allow the immunogen to crosslink alum particles together or become denatured upon binding, either of which could have unpredictable effects on the immune response.",

Binding was measured for three rabbits for each immunization condition and representative images are shown. Statistical tests used were unpaired, two-tailed Student's t-test of the log-transformed data (c,h,j) and a two-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test (g,l). We also demonstrated that site-specific introduction of alumbinding pSer groups enables the epitope specificity of antibody responses to an antigen to be shifted away from immunodominant but nondesired epitopes. While the generality of this strategy remains to be demonstrated for additional antigens beyond the HIV envelope, this approach may be particularly relevant for vaccines targeting viral Articles NATurE MEDiciNE envelope entry receptors. Soluble forms of these proteins typically expose a large surface at the envelope spike base that harbors nonneutralizing epitopes. In the case of HIV Env, the trimer base is an irrelevant target for protective humoral immunity but has been found in animal models to be highly immunogenic 43 , raising concerns that immunodominant base-directed antibody responses might interfere with the induction of desired neutralizing antibody lineages 29 . Oriented antigen display on alum using pSer modification provides one strategy to overcome this issue. Notably, for the HIV gp120 and gp140 trimer immunogens studied here, we routinely achieved yields following peptide coupling and purification of 75-85%, with essentially quantitative substitution of the terminal cysteines. There is likely substantial room for further optimization but these outcomes are promising from a translational immunogen manufacturing perspective and we expect this method will be broadly applicable to diverse subunit vaccines in development for infectious disease and beyond.",

For coupling to eOD and cytochrome c, the antigen at 1 mg ml \u22121 was reacted with 2 molar equivalents of maleimide-pSer overnight at 4 \u00b0C in PBS. MD39 timer was modified with a free cysteine at the C-terminal end of each protomer, to which three pSer linkers could be conjugated at the base of each Env trimer. For reaction to MD39, 20 molar equivalents of maleimide-pSer linker was added to 1 mg ml \u22121 MD39 in PBS to ensure complete reaction to available thiols. Proteins were then separated from unreacted peptide linkers using centrifugal filters (10 kDa MWCO). Reactions were initially monitored using parallel reactions with analogous linkers containing spectroscopic handles (maleimide-dibenzyocyclooctyne linkers) and coupling of the phosphoserines to the antigens was confirmed using a malachite green assay (ThermoFisher). Malachite green assays were quantified using a standard curve prepared using known concentrations of the original pSer linkers.

For naive IgM + VRC01 gHL B cells, the first of the nested PCR was performed using msVHE forward primer (5\u2032 GAGGTGCAGCTGCAGGAGTCTGG) and a murine IgM-specific reverse primer (5\u2032 TGGGAAGGTTCTGATACCCTGGATG) 61 , followed by the second reaction using a VRC01 heavy chain-specific forward primer (5\u2032 GTGCAGCTGGTGCAGTCTGGGGC) and a reverse primer (5\u2032 GACCTGGAGAGGCCATTCTTACC). Sanger sequencing of the PCR products was performed using the forward and reverse primers from the second PCR reaction. Reads were quality checked, trimmed, aligned and analyzed using Sequencher (v.5.1). Amino acid mutation assignments were made using Kabat numbering.",

Purified Fab was added to BG505 SOSIP D664 MD39 mC trimer and complexes were purified using a GE Superose 6 column (GE HealthCare). Complexes were added to 400 mesh carbon-coated grids and stained with 2% uranyl formate. Grids of complexes made of Fab from serum collected at week 10 post immunization were imaged on a Tecnai F20 at 200 KeV using a 4k \u00d7 4k Gatan Ultrascan 4000 CCD. Complexes from week 18 post immunization were collected on a Tecnai Spirit at 120 KeV using a 4k \u00d7 4k TemCam F416 camera. Micrographs were collected with Leginon 62 and processed with Appion 63 . Particles were chosen using DoGpicker 64 and stacked, and initial 2D classes were made with MSA/MRA 65 . After removing classes with double particles or those not resembling trimers or protomers, unbinned particles were put into Relion 66 , where 3D classification was performed to obtain maps of trimer and Fab complexes. Clean maps were then refined and put into Chimera 67 to segment and compare.",
