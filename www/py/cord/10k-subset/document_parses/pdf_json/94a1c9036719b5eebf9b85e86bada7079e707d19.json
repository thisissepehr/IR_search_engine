In this study, a subtracted floral cDNA library from floral buds of A. caudigerum was constructed and cDNA arrays by suppression subtractive hybridization were generated. cDNAs of floral buds at different stages before flower opening and of leaves at the seedling stage were used. The macroarray analyses of expression profiles of isolated floral genes showed that 157 genes out of the 612 unique ESTs tested revealed higher transcript abundance in the floral buds and uppermost leaves. Among them, 78 genes were determined to be differentially expressed in the perianth, 62 in the stamens, and 100 genes in the carpels. Quantitative real-time PCR of selected genes validated the macroarray results. Remarkably, APETALA3 (AP3) B-class genes isolated from A. caudigerum were upregulated in the perianth, stamens and carpels, implying that the expression domain of B-class genes in this basal angiosperm was broader than those in their eudicot counterparts.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Typical angiosperm flowers comprise concentric arrangements of four types of organs, arranged from outward in: sepals, petals, stamens, and the inner carpels ).

In our study, it was noticeable that a considerable number of upregulated transcripts constituted heretofore-uncharacterized genes, or at least hypothetical proteins with unknown gene function. In addition, many transcription factors were differentially upregulated in the flower whorls. Basal angiosperms are very interesting to the study of the origin, diversification, and evolution of angiosperms. Using Neighbor-Joining analysis, we demonstrated that the putative MADS-box transcription factor AcAP3-1 isolated from A. caudigerum is a B-class gene based on the presence of conserved PI motif-derived and the paleoAP3 motif (Fig. 4 ) and the positioning in the phylogeny (Fig. 5) .

The borders of B-function gene expression are also not so clear-cut in Arabidopsis: AP3 and PI, the major Arabidopsis B-function genes, are not entirely restricted to the second and third whorl of the flowers; instead, AP3 is expressed in parts of the first whorl, and PI is expressed in parts of the fourth whorl at early stage (Jack et al. 1992; Goto and Fig. 4 Alignment of the conserved C-terminal domain of predicted proteins from B and Bs lineage homologs.

It is believed that physical interactions of the two proteins are required for protein stability and in turn maintenance of their expression, so that in older flowers their expression is limited to whorls two and three (Goto and Meyerowitz 1994; Riechmann et al. 1996) . It is possible that such a stabilization mechanism will not be present in basal angiosperms. Based on our cDNA macroarray data, the expression domain of B-class AP3-like genes in A. caudigerum was found to be broader than for their counterparts in eudicots (Fig. 7) , as AcAP3-1 expression was found in carpels, and other AP3-like genes were also expressed in the perianth and stamens ( Fig. 7; Table 1 ). Comparative studies of B-class AP3 gene homologs conducted in the family Aristolochiaceae reported AP3 gene expression for the genera Saruma and Aristolochia (Jaramillo and Kramer 2004) . Specifically, B-class AP3 genes were found to be expressed in the second, third and fourth whorls of Saruma henryi, as well as the third and fourth whorls of Aristolochia manshuriensis (Jaramillo and Kramer 2004) .

Therefore, the early floral organ development of A. caudigerum does not progress from the outer whorl inward, but instead the development of the second whorl is delayed. It is consistent with the hypothesis of Buzgo et al. (2004) who suggested a gradual transition in the expression of floral B-class genes in Amborella. Our cDNA macroarray data, RNA in situ hybridization, and qRT-PCR results indicated that AcAP3-1/DV038650 is expressed in carpels, and particularly strongly in the endothelium of ovules. This gene's unusual expression may explain the retarded development of the second-whorl organs. Irish (1999, 2000) proposed that the ABC model was not rigidly fixed during the earliest stages of angiosperm evolution. Irish (2003) cautioned that the applicability of this model outside of the core eudicots would require testing. Indeed, several lines of evidence suggest patterns of gradual transitions among flowers that prompt a ''fading borders'' view of gene expression. This evidence includes the morphological transition between organ identities from perianth to carpels, the results from genome-scale phylogenomics research, and the implied gradual shift in the expression of the B-class genes across the flower in the basal angiosperms (Kramer et al. 2003; Buzgo et al. 2004; Kim et al. 2005; Soltis et al. 2007a, b) . However, there could be antagonistic interactions between the A-class gene products, which are partially responsible for perianth identities, and the C-class genes, which specify stamen and carpel identities in the higher eudicots (Coen and Meyerowitz 1991; Drews et al. 1991; Theissen 2001) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 390, "end": 409, "text": "Buzgo et al.

Less strict requirements for heterodimerization or autoregulatory upregulation may facilitate spatial shifts in the B-function in taxa outside of the eudicots, as detected by the broader gene expression of B-class genes among flowers of A. caudigerum, Amborella and other basal angiosperm lineages.
