Three distinct groups of organisms were found. Cyanobacteria and red algae, both with phycobilisome antenna system, did not show phosphorylation of any of the photosystem II (PSII) proteins and belong to group 1. Group 2 species, consisting of a moss, a liverwort and a fern, phosphorylated both the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b proteins (LHCII) and the PSII core proteins D2 and CP43, but not the D1 protein. Reversible phosphorylation of the D1 protein seems to be the latest event in the evolution of PSII protein phosphorylation and was found only in seed plants, in group 3 species. Light-intensity-dependent regulation of LHCII protein phosphorylation was similar in group 2 and 3 species, with maximal phosphorylation of LHCII at low light and nearly complete dephosphorylation at high light.",

These phosphoproteins mainly belong to the photosystem II (PSII) complex, including the heterodimeric reaction center polypeptides D1 and D2, the internal chlorophyll a antenna polypeptide CP43 and the 9 kDa psbH gene product as well as the two major polypeptides of the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding complex (LHCII). Reversible phosphorylation of all these proteins occurs at the N-terminal threonine residue on the stromal side of the thylakoid membrane [3, 4] . Additionally, a chill-induced light-dependent phosphorylation of a minor chlorophyll a/b binding protein CP29 has been shown to occur in maize leaves [5] . Reversible phosphorylation of PSII proteins in lower photosynthetic organisms is less well characterized. Phosphorylation of D1, D2 or CP43 in red algae or cyanobacteria has not been reported (for reviews, see [6, 7] ), yet the phenomenon has been supposed to be involved in regulatory processes of PSII function [6, 8] . Chlorophyll b-possessing lower eukaryotic organisms, like green algae and mosses, also appear to di\u00a1er from higher plants with respect to PSII core protein phosphorylation [9, 10] . On the other hand, LHCII polypeptide phosphorylation has been established also for green algae [11^13] .",

Reversible D1 protein phosphorylation of higher plants has been shown to play an important role in the regulation of D1 protein turnover and hence the repair of PSII centers under photoinhibitory conditions [15, 16] . PSII repair cycle also involves a conversion of PSII dimers to monomers [17] . The stability of PSII dimers is possibly controlled by reversible phosphorylation of PSII core proteins thus providing another level of regulation for D1 degradation [18] . Thylakoid protein phosphorylation, however, may not only be involved in a short-term regulation of photosynthetic processes but possibly also has a crucial role in physiological and metabolic signalling within chloroplasts or even in the crosstalk between the chloroplast and the nuclear genomes.",

The main phosphoproteins were identi\u00a2ed as P-CP43, P-D2, P-D1 and P-LHCII, with protein-speci\u00a2c antibodies ( Fig. 1) . Detection of the 9 kDa phosphoprotein was not consistently successful. In pumpkin, nearly complete dephosphorylation of the phosphoproteins took place during the dark period and the level of phosphorylation of all the phos-phoproteins increased after a shift to growth light (Fig. 1A) . During high-light treatment, the PSII core protein phosphorylation further increased whereas LHCII was almost completely dephosphorylated, as also shown earlier [19] . 2 . Thylakoid protein phosphorylation in di\u00a1erentially light-treated lower plants with LHCII antenna. Ceratodon, Marchantia and Adiantum were exposed to darkness, to growth light and to high light, and the PSII phosphoproteins were analyzed with phosphothreonine-speci\u00a2c antibody. The corresponding light intensities are indicated above the lanes. For quantitative comparison of immunolabelling, a thylakoid sample of rye, illuminated at 600 Wmol photons m 3P s 3I , was run in parallel with the lower plant samples. On the right hand side, an immunoblot (i) with protein-speci\u00a2c antibodies demonstrating the migration of CP43, D2, P-D1, D1 and LHCB2 in Adiantum (A) and rye (R). this experiment. Phosphorylation of D2 and CP43 responded to increasing irradiance very similarly to that of the D1 protein. As in pumpkin [19] , LHCII showed maximal phosphorylation well below the growth light intensity (300 Wmol photons m 3P s 3I ) and then sharply declined as irradiance increased. Interestingly, exposure of rye plants to high irradiance (2000 Wmol photons m 3P s 3I ) also resulted in an accumulation of a 33 kDa phosphoprotein in the thylakoid membrane. This polypeptide cross-reacted with a CP29-speci\u00a2c antibody (Fig. 1B) and possibly represents the phosphorylated form of the 29 kDa chlorophyll a/b binding protein [5] . It should be noted that in our gel system the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of CP29 could not be separated.",

            "text": "It is noticeable that all organisms in groups 2 and 3, with a capacity to phosphorylate at least D2 and CP43, also possess reversible LHCII phosphorylation (Figs. 1 and 2) [11, 12, 30] . In contrast, no phosphorylated PSII core proteins were detected in the eukaryotic red alga that possesses a phycobilisome antenna instead of LHCII (Fig. 3) . It is therefore conceivable that the PSII core protein phosphorylation is associated with the mechanism of light harvesting into PSII and raises a question weather the phosphorylation of LHCII is the origin for PSII core protein phosphorylation. LCHII phosphorylation has apparently evolved \u00a2rst, together with grana stacking, to regulate the distribution of excitation energy between the two photosystems. Grana stacking, although sometimes very irregular in group 2 species, is typical for species with reversible LHCII phosphorylation. Whether the phosphorylation of D2 and CP43 evolved independently of LHCII phosphorylation cannot be answered at the moment. Indisputably, however, the reversible D1 protein phosphorylation is the latest event in thylakoid protein phosphorylation and present exclusively in seed plants, both angiosperms and gymnosperms.",

However, the regulation of LHCII phosphorylation distinctively di\u00a1ers from that of D2 and CP43, as evidenced by the di\u00a1erential response of the phosphorylation of these proteins to increasing light intensity (Fig. 1) and by the phosphorylation studies with electron transport inhibitors and cyt b T /f mutants [31, 32] . Therefore it is possible that even three di\u00a1erent kinases are involved in reversible phosphorylation of thylakoid proteins in seed plants. Moreover, the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of CP29 is possibly distinct from the kinase(s) involved in phosphorylation of other PSII proteins. Despite intense research, none of the thylakoid-associated kinases have yet been isolated and characterized.",

Reversible PSII core protein phosphorylation may instead have evolved as a regulatory mechanism for the acclimation of PSII function to changing conditions in more developed photosynthetic organisms. Reversible D1 protein phosphorylation has been attributed a distinct role in PSII photoinhibition-repair cycle in higher plants [16, 33] with strict lateral heterogeneity of the thylakoid membrane. PSII core protein phosphorylation in general has been suggested to stabilize PSII dimers and has also been discussed in terms of the regulation of PSII repair [18] .
