Results show a threshold in per capita unvaccinated births through fitted segmented models, below which there is negligible change in polio incidence, however this threshold was not detected in all countries. (Supplementary Fig. S5 ). L-shaped plot of country-specific per capita GDP against polio incidence (Fig. 3) , tell us there are two types of countries, (i) low income countries with high incidence and (ii) high income countries with low incidence. Thus, we divided the data to two groups: countries whose GDP exceeds $1,000, and countries with per capita GDP < $1,000. We explored the impact of economic growth on polio incidence for each group separately by fitting a general additive model (GAM) (See Supplementary Table S1 ). Among high income countries, there was a significant reduction in model deviance using the smoothed response to vaccination (P-value =0.002), however the smoothed response to per capita GDP was not statistically significant.
