Different names have been used to describe various types of miRNA. During evolution, RNA retroviruses or transgenes invaded the eukaryotic genome and inserted in the non-coding regions of DNA, conceivably acting as transposon-like jumping genes, providing defense from viral invasion and fine-funing of gene expression as a secondary level of gene modulation in eukaryotes. When a transposon is inserted in the intron, it becomes an intronic miRNA, taking advantage of the protein synthesis machinery, i.e., mRNA transcription and splicing, as a means for processing and maturation. Recently, miRNAs have been found to play an important, but not life-threatening, role in embryonic development. They might play a pivotal role in diverse biological systems in various organisms, facilitating a quick response and accurate plotting of body physiology and structures. Based on these unique properties, man-made intronic miRNAs have been developed for in vitro evaluation of gene function, in vivo gene therapy and generation of transgenic animal models. The biogenesis and identification of miRNAs, potential applications, and future directions for research are presented, hopefully providing a guideline for further miRNA and gene function studies.",

Changes in these sequences are frequently associated with clinical and circumstantial malfunction. Some of these non-coding sequences are responsible for RNAmediated gene silencing through an RNA interference (RNAi)-like mechanism. One potentially important class of genes corresponding to RNAs that lack significant open reading frames and appear to encode RNA as their final product is the miRNAs. These miRNAs can play critical roles in development, protein secretion, and gene regulation. Some of them are naturally occurring antisense RNAs, whereas others have more complex structures. To understand the diseases caused by dysregulation of these miRNAs, a tissue-specific expression system is needed to recreate the function and mechanism of individual miRNA in vitro and in vivo.",

[11] tried to intensify flower pigmentation by introducing additional genes, but unexpectedly observed reduced floral pigmentation in some plants, suggesting that gene silencing may be involved in naturally occurring regulation of gene function. This introduction of multiple transgenic copies of a gene into the Petunia plant resulted in gene silencing of not only the transgenic, but also the endogenous gene copy, as has been observed by others [12] . This suggests co-suppression of homologous genes (the transfer gene and the endogenous gene) and possible methylation are involved [12, 13] . This phenomenon is termed RNAi.

RNAi is a mechanism by which small regulatory RNAs possessing a sequence complementary to that of a portion of a target gene interferes with the expression of that gene. It is thought that the dsRNA, once it enters the cells, is cut up by an RNAseIII-familial endonuclease, known as Dicer. Dicer consists of an amino terminal helicase domain, a PAZ domain, two RNAse III motifs, and a dsRNA binding motif. Therefore, Dicer binds to the dsRNA and excises the dsRNA into siRNA. These siRNAs locate other singlestranded RNA molecules that are completely complementary to either strand of the siRNA duplex. Then, the RNA-degrading enzymes (RNAses) destroy the RNAs complementary to the siRNAs. This phenomenon is also named post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) or transgene quelling. In other words, gene silencing can be activated by introducing transgenes, RNA viruses, or dsRNA sequences that are completely complementary to the targeted gene transcripts.",

To counterattack the activity of transposons and viruses, some organisms developed a mechanism to remove and/or silence the activity of transposons and viruses. For example, bacteria frequently delete their genes so that transposons and retroviruses incorporated in the genome are removed. In eukaryotes, miRNA is a way of reducing transposon activity.

First, miRNA is generated as a long primary precursor miRNA (pri-miRNA), most likely mediated by RNA polymerases type II (Pol-II) [41, 42] . The pri-miRNA is transcribed from the genome. Second, the long pri-miRNA is excised by Drosha-like RNase III endonucleases and/or spliceosomal components to form the *60-70 nt precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA). The pre-miRNA exhibits considerable secondary structure including regions of imperfectly paired dsRNA, which are sequentially cleaved to one or more miRNAs. This step depends on the origin of the pri-miRNA, whether located in an exon or an intron respectively [41, 42] . Third, the pre-miRNA is exported out of the nucleus by Ran-GTP and a receptor, Exportin-5 [25, 43] . In the cytoplasm, Dicer-like endonucleases cleave the pre-miRNA to form mature 18-25 nt miRNA. Lastly, the mature miRNA is incorporated into a ribonuclear particle (RNP) to form the RNA-induced gene silencing complex (RISC) which executes RNAi-related gene silencing [44, 45] . Only one of the two strands is the miRNA; the other counterpart is named miRNA*. The mature miRNA can block mRNA translation based on partial complementarity between the miRNA and the targeted mRNA, particularly via base pairing with the 3 0 -untranslated region of the mRNA. If there is a perfect complementarity between the miRNA and the targeted mRNA, mRNA degradation occurs similarly to that mediated by siRNA. Autoregulatory negative feedback via miRNAs regulates some genes, including those involved in the RNA silencing mechanism itself.",

But the link between final miRNA maturation and RISC assembly remains unknown. However, there is evidence that the actions of Dicer and RISC in siRNA and miRNA processing are distinct [27, 28] . In recent studies using zebrafish, it was demonstrated that the stem-loop structure of the pre-miRNAs is involved in strand selection for mature miRNA during RISC assembly. These findings further suggest that the duplex structure of siRNA may not be strictly required for the assembly of miRNA-associated RISC in vivo. Proposed pathways for the biogenesis of miRNA are based on the in vitro model developed for siRNA. For these reasons, future work needs to focus on distinguishing the individual properties and differences in action of Dicer and RISC in siRNA and miRNA processing. Conceivably, siRNA is a defence mechanism against immediate insertion of viral genes or transposons in plants and lower animals. In contrast, miRNA over evolutionary time selects segments of transposons for incorporation into the genome for fine-tuning of gene regulation in vertebrates, including human beings. This hypothesis for the differences between siRNA and miRNA gene silencing may provide a clue toward explaining the prevalence of native siRNAs in invertebrates but relative scarcity in mammals.",

Xist is preferentially expressed from only one of the two female X chromosomes and builds up in cis along the chromosome from which it was transcribed. That X chromosome is tightly packaged in transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin; therefore, only one female Xchromosome is active. This phenomenon is associated with DNA methylation.

Then, the secondary structure is examined in terms of both the forward and reverse complements of the sequence. In addition, the following criteria help to identify miRNAs: the longest helical arm, free energy of the arm, short internal loops, and asymmetric and bulged loops. The identified miRNAs usually are more heterogeneous than those discovered experimentally, suggesting traditional cloning has a high false negative or miss rate. However, computational techniques may suffer from a high false alarm rate. Therefore, validation of the identified miRNAs by Northern blot analysis and functional study is critical. These methods are still evolving and there is a possibility of one-to-many and many-to-one relationships between the miRNAs and their targets. Potentially thousands of mammalian targets may be identified with this approach.",

Some of these chips use locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified oligonucleotides so as to allow both miRNA in situ hybridization and miRNA expression profiling [63] . Again, this approach can identify regulation via a large class of miRNAs. A good example is the studies of miRNAs regulating brain morphogenesis in zebrafish [64] . Fig. 1 Comparison of biogenesis and RNAi mechanisms among siRNA, intergenic (exonic) miRNA, and intronic miRNA. SiRNA is likely formed by two perfectly complementary RNAs transcribed from two different promoters (remains to be determined) and further processing into 19-22 bp duplexes by the RNase III-familial endonuclease, Dicer. The biogenesis of intergenic miRNAs, e.g., lin-4 and let-7, involves a long transcript precursor (pri-miRNA), which is probably generated by Pol-II or Pol-III RNA promoters, while intronic miRNAs are transcribed by the Pol-II promoters of its encoded genes and co-expressed in the intron regions of the gene transcripts (pre-mRNA). After RNA splicing and further processing, the spliced intron may function as a pri-miRNA for intronic miRNA generation. In the nucleus, the pri-miRNA is excised by Drosha RNase to form a hairpin-like pre-miRNA template and then exported to the cytoplasm for further processing by Dicer* to form mature miRNAs. The Dicers for siRNA and miRNA pathways are different. All three small regulatory RNAs are finally incorporated into an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which contains either strand of siRNA or the single-strand of miRNA. The effect of miRNA is considered to be more specific and less adverse than that of siRNA because only one strand is involved. On the other hand, siRNAs primarily trigger mRNA degradation, whereas miRNAs can induce either mRNA degradation or suppression of protein synthesis depending on the sequence complementarity to the target gene transcripts",

The evidence of intronic miRNA-induced silencing of gene expression in cell lines, zebrafish, chicken embryos, and mouse skin demonstrates that this ancient intron-mediated gene regulation system is highly conserved in eukaryotes. Intronic regulation of gene expression is mediated through the activation of miRNAmediated RNAi effects. From an evolutionary vantage point, the genome exhibits a remarkable increase in the complexity and variety of introns in higher plants and animals; therefore, the influence of intronic gene regulation to facilitate genome stability and gene coordination progressively increases phylogenetically. Conceivably, dysregulation of intronic miRNAs is highly likely to reveal the interwined actions between intronic miRNA and gene expression, leading to a better understanding of the genetic etiology of human diseases. The success of intronic miRNA generation by artificial means in vivo may provide a powerful tool to study the mechanism by which miRNAs induce diseases and will hopefully provide novel gene therapies.",

Further, RNAi knockdown experiments with fly and human DGCR8 showed both accumulation and reduction of pri-miRNAs as well as mature miRNAs.

Nevertheless, there are still problems in the efficient use of miRNA. Indeed, evaluating the function and effectiveness of the miRNAs so far identified may contribute greatly to our understanding of gene regulation and the control of the differentiation and development of cells.",

This information can be used for designing and developing potential drugs as novel gene therapies. Furthermore, the elucidation of genomic control of gene activities mediated via miRNA may play a crucial role in the characterization and treatment of disease at the molecular level. At the same time, our still very limited knowledge of the biological functions of genes and proteins at different levels of cellular organization is preventing full exploitation of the available data. We believe that the recent discovery of miRNAs will fill the gap and lead to unlimited functional prediction based on the DNA-miRNA and RNA-miRNA paradigm. In theory, oncogene and transgene expression could be inhibited by synthetic miRNAs, a simple, effective gene therapy. Thus, miRNAs or their machineries are now known to be involved in several human diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders. Specific removal of the target genes by miRNAs or their associate mediators can be developed as a simple gene therapy [68] .",

The problems in preventing viral infections such as HIV are as follows: first, the global prevalence of epidemic proportions is mainly caused by the high mutation rate of the HIV genome that gradually generates more resistant strains to highly active antiretroviral therapies. Second, the HIV provirus is capable of integrating into a host cellular genome to escape from the inhibitory effects of the treatment, thus inactivating the viral replication cycle rather than destroying the latent viral genome, resulting in an increased number of HIV carriers. Such an increase of drug-resistant HIV strains and their carriers has posed great challenges and financial burdens for the AIDS prevention programs. To alleviate such problems, miRNAs can trigger either translation repression or RNA degradation depending on their degree of complementarity with the target genes. Our approach, using vector-based miRNA, to overcome the complications of HIV mutation is a breakthrough in the field. We believe the knowledge obtained from this research will facilitate the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines against HIV infections [69, 70] . Similar approaches for the treatment of viral diseases will target avian flu, SARS, HBV, human papillomavirus, and polio.",

All pharmaceutically developed drugs can be screened with this approach in loss-offunction transgenic zebrafish. In addition, this approach may shed light on the effects of miRNAs on embryonic development, environmental impacts, and micro-modulation of gene functions, particularly brain and heart functions.
