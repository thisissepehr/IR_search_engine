In this study, to illustrate the impacts of the human behavioral responses, a new class of individuals, S F , is introduced to the classical susceptible-infected-recovered model. In the model, S F state represents that susceptible individuals who take self-initiate protective measures to lower the probability of being infected, and a susceptible individual may go to S F state with a response rate when contacting an infectious neighbor. Via the percolation method, the theoretical formulas for the epidemic threshold as well as the prevalence of epidemic are derived. Our finding indicates that, with the increasing of the response rate, the epidemic threshold is enhanced and the prevalence of epidemic is reduced. The analytical results are also verified by the numerical simulations. In addition, we demonstrate that, because the mean field method neglects the dynamic correlations, a wrong result based on the mean field method is obtained-the epidemic threshold is not related to the response rate, i.e., the additional S F state has no impact on the epidemic threshold.

Therefore, it is very important to incorporate human behaviors into epidemiological models, which could improve models' utility in reflecting the reality and studying corresponding controlling measures. However, analytically grounded approaches to the problem of interacting effect between epidemic dynamics and human behavioral responses are still lacking so far, and what can help us better understand the impacts of human behavioral responses. In this work, by introducing a new S F state into classical susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model to mimic the situation that, when susceptible individuals are aware of the risk of infection, they may take self-protective measures to lower the probability of being infected. We then derive theoretical formulas based on the percolation method for the epidemic threshold and the prevalence of epidemic. Our results indicate that the introduction of the new S F state can significantly enhance the epidemic threshold and reduce the prevalence of epidemic. It is worth mentioning that a wrong result may be obtained when using the traditional mean field methodthe epidemic threshold is not altered by the additional S F state. The result highlights that if the effects of human behavioral responses are ignored in mathematical modeling, the obtained results cannot really reflect the spreading mechanism of epidemics among human population.",

            "text": "Since network models can well describe the spreading of infectious disease among populations, many efforts have been devoted to studying this field. 1,2 At first, researchers mainly paid attention to analyze the impact of the network structure on epidemic spreading and the control strategies, for example, how the network topology affects the epidemic threshold and the prevalence of epidemic, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] or how to design an effective immunization strategy to control the outbreaks of epidemics. 9, 10 In reality, outbreaks of epidemics can trigger spontaneous behavioral responses of individuals to take preventive measures, which in turn alters the epidemic dynamics and affects the disease transmission process. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Thus, recently, some studies have made attempts to evaluate the impact of the human behaviors on epidemic dynamics. For instance, Funk et al. 18 studied the impacts of awareness spread on both epidemic threshold and prevalence, and they found that, in a well-mixed population, spread of awareness can reduce the prevalence of epidemic but does not tend to affect the epidemic threshold, yet the epidemic threshold is altered when considering on social networks; Sahneh et al. considered a Susceptible-Alter-Infected-Susceptible (SAIS) model, 19 and they found that the way of behavioral response can enhance the epidemic threshold; Meloni et al. constructed a meta-population model incorporating several scenarios of self-initiated behavioral changes into the mobility patterns of individuals, and they found that such behavioral changes do not alter the epidemic threshold, but may increase rather than decrease a) One fact is that the infectious neighbors can infect a susceptible individual, also triggering the awareness of the susceptible individual. 19, 22 In view of this, in Ref. 23 , Perra et al. introduced a new class of individuals, S F , that represents susceptible people who self-initiate behavioral changes that lead to a reduction in the transmissibility of the infectious disease, into the classical SIR model, and they found that such a model (SS FIR ) can induce a rich phase space with multiple epidemic peaks and tipping points. However, the network structure was not incorporated into these models. As we know, when the model is considered within the network based framework, new theoretical tools should be used and new phenomena may be observed. In view of this, we incorporate the network structure into the SS FIR model 23 to investigate its spreading dynamics. In the model, when contacting an infectious neighbor, susceptible individuals may be infected (from S state I state) with a transmission rate, or a behavioral response may be triggered (from S state to S F state) with a response rate. We provide a theoretical formula for the epidemic threshold as well as the prevalence of epidemic via the percolation method, 5 our results show that the introduction of S F class can enhance the epidemic threshold and reduce the prevalence of epidemic. We also demonstrate that a wrong result can be obtained-the introduction of S F class cannot alter the epidemic threshold when using mean field method to such a model.

The simulation results based on the Eqs. (22)- (25) in Fig. 6 also indicate that, based on mean field method, the epidemic threshold is not altered by different values of b F or c. However, our previous simulation results based on Monte Carlo method have suggested FIG. 4 . Comparison between the Monte Carlo based simulations and the theoretical predictions for R\u00f01\u00de on UCM networks. The simulation results are denoted by symbols and the theoretical predictions are denoted by the corresponding lines. The theoretical results are obtained by substituting a fixed degree distribution P(k) into Eqs. (17) and (18) , and then R\u00f01\u00de can be solved from Eqs. (17) and (18) that the epidemic threshold b c is increased when b F is increased or c is reduced. That is to say, the conclusion obtained by mean-field method is wrong. Now let us explain why the mean field method gives a wrong result. It is known that, near the epidemic threshold, the fraction of infected nodes (label q I ) is very small. When using the mean field method, the dynamic correlation is neglected, the probability of S node becoming S F is proportional to O\u00f0q I \u00de since the average fraction of infected nodes among neighborhood equals to O\u00f0q I \u00de. Similarly, the probability of S F node becoming I node is also proportional to O\u00f0q I \u00de. As a result, the probability of S!S F !I is proportional to O\u00f0q 2 I \u00de, which leads to the effect of the S F is ignored and the epidemic threshold obtained by the mean field method is not related to the value of b F or c. In fact, when an S node becomes an S F node there must exist at least one infected nodes among the neighborhood of the S node. More importantly, these infected neighbors may exist for a certain time interval, so the probability of S!S F !I is not proportional to O\u00f0q 2 I \u00de. However, as deduced in Eq. (9), the dynamics correlation near the epidemic threshold is considered in our above analysis, which can accurately predict the epidemic threshold.",

By using theoretical analysis as well as numerical simulations, we found that the prevalence of epidemic is effectively reduced and the epidemic threshold is remarkably increased when the response rate b F is increased or the discount factor c is reduced. Moreover, we have demonstrated that the mean field based analysis provides a wrong result: the epidemic threshold is not related to the response rate b F or discount factor c.

In view of this, recent well-studied multiplex network theory may be an ideal framework to mimic the interplay of information or related awareness and the epidemic dynamics. [33] [34] [35] Thus, how to generalize our model to multiplex networks and provide theoretical analysis to the model is a challenge in our further work. ",

On the other hand, for a fixed value of b, Figs. 1(a) and 1(c) suggest that the prevalence of epidemic is remarkably reduced when b F is increased. The results suggest that, by introducing an additional protective state, S F , to the classical SIR model, the conclusions are quite different from the previous results which have not incorporated the impacts of human behavioral responses. The result again emphasizes the fact that the spontaneous behavioral responses of individuals to the emergent diseases have vital impacts on the epidemic dynamics.",
