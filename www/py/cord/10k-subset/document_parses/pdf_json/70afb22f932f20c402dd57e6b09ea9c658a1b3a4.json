Globally, zoonotic infections are responsible for a high disease burden; approximately 60% of all known human diseases and 75% of diseases associated with recent epidemics or pandemics were zoonoses (Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria 2005; Taylor et al. 2009; WHO 2017) . Despite the high prevalence of zoonoses, the emergence of zoonotic disease remains difficult to predict and the underlying mechanisms that drive these processes are not well-understood. Studies of zoonotic exposure and hazardous behavior, including the co-sampling of animals, humans, and food products with animal origins, are one approach for better predicting and ultimately intervening in zoonotic disease outbreaks. Contact with infected animals, and/or exposure to contaminated environments, contributes to the emergence and spread of zoonotic diseases in human populations. It is additionally known that increased contact between animals and humans provides more opportunity for exposure to zoonotic pathogens (WHO 2017) . Accordingly, the human populations at the highest risk of zoonotic infections are those that have the most frequent interactions with animals. For this reason, slaughterers, animal health workers, animal-raising farmers, and those that trade in wildlife are likely at greater risk of zoonotic infection than those outside of the agricultural industry.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 97, "end": 107, "text": "(WHO 2018)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 324, "end": 346, "text": "Gowtage-Sequeria 2005;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 347, "end": 366, "text": "Taylor et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 367, "end": 376, "text": "WHO 2017)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1096, "end": 1106, "text": "(WHO 2017)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Southeast Asia is considered to be a major hotspot for emerging zoonotic diseases (Morse et al. 2012; Horby et al. 2013) .

More than three quarters of all interviewed participants (animal-raising farmers, slaughterers, animal health workers, and rat traders) and over two-thirds of the interviewed subjects, with the exception of animal-raising farmers, reported raising exotic or domestic animals in their backyard or around the family household. Exposure to exotic animals was greater in Dak Lak province than in Dong Thap province, which largely reflects the distinct ( profiles of the two locations. Dong Thap is closer to Ho Chi Minh City; therefore, there is a greater demand for nonexotic meat. In contrast, Dak Lak is more remote and caters more for the local rural population. Beside routine occupational exposures to animals, cohort subjects had contact with a large variety of animal types, including fifteen types of exotic and domestic animals. Moreover, the animal species that the cohort members were most exposed to (wild pigs, porcupines, rice field rats, deer, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats, ducks, and cattle) are known to be potential reservoirs for zoonotic pathogens (Hart and Trees 1997; Acha and Szyfres 2003; Meng et al. 2009; Kreuder Johnson et al. 2015) . These interactions with a range of animals are related to the fact that more than two-thirds of those in the cohort practiced backyard farming. This proportion was higher than the average within the Vietnamese population; approximately 50% of all households in Vietnam are estimated to farm animals (GSO-General Statistics Office of Vietnam 2013), and small-scale animal production is particularly common in rural Vietnam. This industry is maintained by the higher prices (often more than double) demanded for ''home reared'' animal meat in comparison to animals raised in industrial facilities. Additionally, rural Vietnamese people like to support their community and purchase local produce. A large range of activates in this industry is highlighted by the fact that the majority of farming families reported raising several animal species in small numbers in or around their households (Phuong et al. 2015) . These data suggest a low level of biosecurity with the potential for the mixing of multiple animal species; we speculate that this increases the risk of pathogen transfer between animals and may lead to a greater likelihood for exposure to zoonotic diseases in those farming animals. The presence of a large variety of animal types in small areas, particularly in single households farming a mixture of animal species, may increase opportunity for species-crossing pathogen transmission events, as illustrated by the emergence of avian influenza H5N1 virus in Vietnam in 2003, with the first reported case coming from Dong Thap.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1182, "end": 1203, "text": "(Hart and Trees 1997;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1204, "end": 1226, "text": "Acha and Szyfres 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1227, "end": 1244, "text": "Meng et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1245, "end": 1273, "text": "Kreuder Johnson et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2166, "end": 2186, "text": "(Phuong et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "We found that safety procedures for those handling live animals or involved in slaughtering or butchering were inadequate. Notably, a low proportion of cohort members reported not using any PPE when handling animals. These data indicate a pervasive poor understanding of occupational exposure that may result in increased potential for zoonotic disease transmission if animals are infected with zoonotic pathogens. This lack of PPE usage was specifically common among the animal slaughterers, where contact with fresh blood is a sustained occupational hazard. The risk of such activities is highlighted by recent reports of the transmission of Trypanosoma evansi and rabies in central and northern Vietnam, which likely occurred during the butchering of raw meat, and processing of the animal brain or via contact with animal saliva, respectively (Wertheim et al. 2009b; Chau et al. 2016) . A lack of PPE was also significantly associated with being bitten by animals; while this is not surprising, the proportion of other animal-induced injuries also corresponded with low PPE usage. A study conducted by Rui Carlos and co-workers (Schneider et al. 2013) found that a lack of PPE usage in Brazil was associated with the transmission of Brucella abortus from animals to slaughterers at slaughterhouses. Therefore, this lack of PPE usage may indicate a higher exposure risk for zoonotic infections among cohort subjects. This observation is particularly concerning, and we advocate better education for PPE use in animal worker and slaughters.

In Vietnam, animal-product consumers enjoy many foods that would be considered atypical in the west; exotic animals are a particular delicacy. Almost all of the interviewed cohort members had consumed at least one of thirteen different types of exotic animal over the three-year study period. The thought is that the consumption of exotic animals has preventative health benefits and/or a positive medical treatment effect. For example, the consumption of porcupine stomach is believed to cure stomach pain, and porcupine bile is used as an analgesic. Furthermore, grated deer horn is thought to treat a multitude of chronic diseases and prolong life. A general increase in income across the population and permission from the Vietnamese government for wildlife farming in recent years (Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development-Vietnam) have played a major role in the rise of exotic animal consumption. The overlap between the types of animals raised, slaughtered, cooked, and consumed by the cohort subjects indicates that increasing consumption requires more intensive farming, slaughtering, cooking, and the hunting exotic animals to supply this increasing demand. As the current economic trajectory is predicted to continue to improve across Vietnam (The World Bank in Vietnam 2017), it is probable that the consumption of exotic animals will increase. This increase in the rearing intensity of exotic animals may have a possible knock-on effect for disease exposures within the general population.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "An additional specific practice in Vietnam that may increase the risk of zoonotic exposures is consumption of raw animal blood or meat. More than a half of the cohort members reported the consumption of raw animal blood or meat over the study period. This proportion was high, especially considering that sale of raw blood dishes was banned by the Vietnamese government in 2009 (The Agriculture Ministry of Vietnam). The consumption of raw animal blood is found to have a higher possibility of infections from blood-borne zoonotic pathogens such as Streptococcus suis (Wertheim et al. 2009a; Navacharoen et al. 2009; Trung et al. 2011) , Trichinella spiralis De et al. 2015) , and Brucella spp. (Njeru et al. 2016) . Counter-intuitively, we also found that the majority of the raw-blood consumers considered that eating raw blood was not good for their health. Raw-blood consumption in Vietnam is largely cultural and is a common dish at special gatherings or celebrations in several geographic areas. Raw animal blood is also thought to have potential health benefits, such as boosting the immune system, reducing body temperature, preventing anemia, and as treating headaches, coughs, and dysentery (Thi et al. 2014 ). These social factors show that culture strongly drives consumer tastes, and restricting the population eating raw animal blood is more of a social issue than a scientific one.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 568, "end": 591, "text": "(Wertheim et al. 2009a;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 592, "end": 616, "text": "Navacharoen et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 617, "end": 635, "text": "Trung et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 659, "end": 674, "text": "De et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 695, "end": 714, "text": "(Njeru et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1201, "end": 1217, "text": "(Thi et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "An analysis of demography in the cohort members further demonstrated potential risks of zoonotic disease exposure. Approximately a quarter of the subjects had a low education level, which has been previously associated with a higher incidence of numerous communicable diseases (Zimmerman and Woolf 2014; Bruce et al. 2019) . These data, together with a high exposure to potential sources of zoonotic disease, indicate a possible elevated risk of zoonotic infections in the cohort subjects. We also identified significant differences between exposures to potential zoonotic sources by location, sex, age group, education level, and profession; high frequency of contact with animals is associated with a likelihood of increased zoonotic transmission (Howard and Fletcher 2012; WHO 2017) . Therefore, it is important to elucidate the demographic/social factors that drive zoonotic infections to induce feasible interventions and to determine whether consistency or variation in exposure over time results elevated or reduced risk. To achieve this, it will be essential to further gather information on the incidence of zoonotic disease in those that work with animals and also measure the exposure to given pathogens.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 277, "end": 303, "text": "(Zimmerman and Woolf 2014;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 304, "end": 322, "text": "Bruce et al. 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 749, "end": 775, "text": "(Howard and Fletcher 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 776, "end": 785, "text": "WHO 2017)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Our study contains limitations. This was a cohort consisting of individuals with a perceived risk of zoonotic disease, and control subjects without animal exposures were not recruited. Additionally, we did not distinguish between those farming or hunting exotic animals, as raising many types of exotic animals is common and permitted in Vietnam. Furthermore, we did not evaluate disease episodes with a suitable control group (those not working with animals) or measure serological exposure; therefore, we cannot estimate whether those working with animals do have an increased incidence of infectious disease from an animal origin.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Despite the apparent limitations, our study illustrates that, in addition to occupational exposures, individuals that work with animals in Vietnam are frequently exposed to a range of animal species which is likely to increase their risk of zoonotic disease exposures. Sustained animal exposure and a large variety of animal species demonstrate that slaughterers, animal health workers, animal-raising farmers, and rat traders are sentinel professions for performing zoonotic disease surveillance. Additionally, the attitudes and behavior of the cohort members show that they have limited knowledge of potentially zoonotic disease exposures. The data presented here, in combination with further sero-epidemiological and molecular studies, will aid in elucidating the potential factors associated with a comparatively high incidence of emerging zoonotic disease in Southeast Asia.
