The increased susceptibility to infection of animals in which genes encoding cytokines or cytokine receptors are mutated or deleted is strong evidence to support a crucial role for cytokine-or cytokine-receptor-dependent signalling pathways in regulating antimicrobial host defences. However, dysregulated production of pro-inflammatory mediators might also become life-threatening, as shown in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, indicating that tight regulation of cytokine production is required.",

However, monocytes, macrophages, blood dendritic cells, B cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, mast cells and basophils have since been shown to express MIF [37] [38] [39] . In contrast to most cytokines, MIF is constitutively expressed and stored in intracellular pools, and therefore does not require de novo protein synthesis before secretion. Similar to interleukin-1 (IL-1), basic fibroblast growth factor and a secreted form of cyclophilin, MIF lacks an amino-terminal leader sequence, indicating that it is released from cells by a non-conventional protein-secretion pathway. Besides the immune system, MIF has a broad tissue distribution (FIG. 3) . Notably, MIF is expressed by cells and tissues that are in direct contact with the host's natural environment, such as the lung, the epithelial lining of the skin, and gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. Another distinctive feature of MIF is its high level of expression by several tissues of the endocrine system, especially by organs that are involved in stress responses (hypothalamus, pituitary and adrenal glands) 7,40-42 .",

Searching of the human genome for homologues of MIF indicated that D-dopachrome tautomerase (DDT) was the only gene with marked homology to MIF 14 . As both genes are located relatively close on chromosome 22, it is tempting to speculate that the MIF and DDT genes are duplications of a common ancestral gene that have evolved to have different biological functions. Two polymorphisms of the human MIF gene have been linked to human diseases. One is a single-nucleotide mutation (a G-to-C transition at position -173) in the 5\u2032 flanking region, which is associated with systemic-onset juvenile arthritis 15 .

MIF, also known as glycosylationinhibiting factor (GIF), has been reported to suppress IgE synthesis and have antigen-specific suppressor activity 17 . Surprisingly, MIF does not seem to belong to any cytokine superfamily. Homologues of mammalian MIF have been found in chickens, both jawless and jawed fish, ticks, parasites, plants (Arabidopsis thaliana) and cyanobacteria 9, [18] [19] [20] [21] Timeline | The history of MIF downregulation of expression of TLR4 -the signaltransducing molecule of the LPS receptor complex 45, 46 . MIF upregulates the expression of TLR4 by acting on the ETS family of transcription factors, including PU.1, which are crucial for transcription of the mouse Tlr4 gene (FIG. 4a) . Therefore, MIF facilitates the detection of endotoxin-containing bacteria, enabling cells that are at the forefront of the host antimicrobial defence system, such as macrophages, to respond rapidly to invasive bacteria. Rapid production of pro-inflammatory cytokines is absolutely essential for mounting the host defensive response. Consistent with this concept, it was reported recently that Mif-deficient mice failed to control the growth of the intracellular pathogen Salmonella typhimurium and succumbed to infection 47 . Increased susceptibility of Mif-deficient mice to infection was associated with reduced plasma levels of the cytokines tumour-necrosis factor (TNF), IL-12 and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), but not of nitric oxide (NO), and with higher bacterial counts compared with wild-type mice. This indicates that MIF promotes a protective T HELPER 1 (T H 1)-CELL immune response against S. typhimurium. Taken together, these observations provide a rationale for the constitutive expression of MIF by cells and tissues that are in close proximity to the external environment (FIG. 3) . Moreover, it offers a mechanism whereby Mif-deficient mice are resistant to lethal endotoxaemia 8 .",

Indeed, Mif-deficient macrophages were found to be hyporesponsive to LPS and Gram-negative bacteria, but not to other stimuli, as shown by reduced cytokine production due to the CD74 CD74, also known as the MHC class-II-associated invariant chain (Ii), is implicated in the transport of MHC class II proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex.

At first glance, endocytosis would seem to be an atypical mode of action for a classic cytokine. However, it does not necessarily imply that endocytosis of MIF would bypass the requirement for a direct interaction with a membrane-bound receptor. In fact, there are examples of endosomes being implicated in signal transduction that is mediated by ligand-activated cytokine receptors. One such example is the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) receptor [55] [56] [57] .

Experiments carried out in Mif-deficient mice confirmed that a lack of Mif is associated with increased resistance to Grampositive shock caused by staphylococcal enterotoxin B 8 (BOX 1). MIF is also released by cells of whole blood stimulated with heat-killed Streptococcus pneumoniae, and MIF-specific antibody reduces cytokine production and increases survival in a mouse model of S. pneumoniaeinduced pneumonia (T.C. et al., unpublished observations). Together with the observations obtained in experimental models of endotoxaemia and Gramnegative sepsis, these data indicate that MIF has an important role in the pathogenesis of bacterial infections.",

Phagocytosis of erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium chabaudi or uptake of malarial pigment (hemozoin) by macrophages induced the release of MIF 70 . MIF inhibits erythroid, multipotential and granulocyte-macrophage progenitor-derived colony formation, indicating that it could be implicated in the pathophysiology of malarial anaemia.

As summarized earlier, MIF is rapidly released by immune cells that are exposed to microbial products or to pro-inflammatory cytokines, or during antigen-specific activation, and has potent autocrine and paracrine effects that promote cell growth and survival. Using MIF-deficient cells, MIF-specific antibodies or recombinant MIF, investigators have provided evidence that MIF directly or indirectly promotes the production or expression of a large panel of proinflammatory molecules, including cytokines (such as TNF, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8 and macrophage inflammatory protein 2) 40,72-75 , nitric oxide 8,11 , COX2 and products of the arachidonic acid pathway (such as PGE 2 ) 44, 50 , and several matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors 76, 77 .

Although a recent survey in the United States on the epidemiology of sepsis indicated that mortality is decreasing 62 , identification of new treatments is still a priority as death rates of severe sepsis (20-35%) and septic shock (50-60%) remain high. The intrinsic pro-inflammatory properties of MIF, the fact that it is highly expressed by innate immune cells, and that it has a crucial role in macrophage responses against microbial products provide compelling evidence in support of a role for MIF in sepsis. This hypothesis has been tested in several experimental models of toxic shock and live bacterial sepsis, which have shown that excessive production of MIF is harmful in the acute Confirming and extending these observations, we recently found evidence that MIF inhibits both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of cytokine production by glucocorticoids (T.C. and T.R., unpublished observations).

The human macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) gene is composed of three short exons (green boxes) of 107, 172 and 66 base pairs, and two introns (pink boxes) of 188 and 94 base pairs. Its 5\u2032 regulatory region contains several consensus DNA-binding sequences for transcription factors, notably activator protein 1 (AP1), nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), ETS, GATA, SP1 and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). However, little is known about the relevance of these putative DNA-binding sites in the regulation of expression of the human MIF gene. Two polymorphisms of the human MIF gene (arrows) -a CATT-tetranucleotide sequence repeated five to eight times at position -794 and a G-to-C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position -173 -have been associated with the severity of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis.",

MIF is expressed in the brain (by the cortex, hypothalamus and cerebellum neurons, hippocampus, pons, glial cells, ependyma and astrocytes); in the eye (by the lens and epithelial cells of the cornea, iris and ciliary body, endothelial cells, and cells of the retina including epithelial cells, Muller cells and astrocytes); in the ear (by middle ear effusion); in the immune system (in the thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, blood and bone marrow, by monocytes/macrophages, T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, eosinophils, basophils, neutrophils and mast cells); in the lungs (by macrophages and epithelial cells); in the heart and vasculature (by endothelial cells); in the breast; in the endocrine system (by the pituitary gland, adrenal cortex and \u03b2-islet cells of the pancreas); in the liver (by Kuppfer cells, hepatocytes and endothelial cells); in the testis, prostate and ovaries (by Leydig cells, epithelial cells and granulosa cells of the follicles); in the gastrointestinal tract (by epithelial cells of the oesophagus, stomach, small and large intestines, and neurons); in the kidney (by epithelial cells, endothelial cells and mesangial cells); in fat tissue (by adipocytes); in the skin (by keratinocytes, sebaceous glands, hair follicles, endothelial cells and fibroblasts); and in bone and joints (by osteoblasts, fibroblasts and synoviocytes).",

            "text": "Mode of action of MIF. a | Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) might mediate its biological activities either through a classical receptor-mediated pathway or through a non-classical endocytic pathway. MIF has been shown to bind to CD74 and to phosphorylate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1)/ERK2 proteins. MIF promotes cell growth and activates transcription factors of the ETS family known to be crucial for expression of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) gene that encodes the signal-transducing molecule of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor complex. MIF binds to JUN-activation domain-binding protein 1 (JAB1), preventing JAB1-induced activation of JUN and JAB1-induced degradation of the cell-proliferation inhibitor KIP1, thereby leading to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. b | The induction and regulation of inflammatory responses of innate immune cells by MIF. MIF upregulates the expression of TLR4 by macrophages allowing rapid recognition of endotoxin-containing bacteria, which promotes the production of cytokines (including MIF), nitric oxide (NO) and other mediators. After it is released, MIF activates a cascade of events consisting of the phosphorylation of ERK1/ERK2, the induction of cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (PLA2), arachidonic acid, JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity and prostaglandin E2 (PGE 2 ). Through the generation of oxidoreductase activity and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), MIF prevents activation-induced apoptosis mediated by the oxidative burst and by p53. c | MIF counter-regulates the immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. MIF inhibits the glucocorticoid-mediated induction of inhibitor of nuclear factor-\u03baB (I\u03baB) synthesis and messenger RNA destabilization, and overrides the glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of PLA2 activity and arachidonic acid production. iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase.",

            "text": "Role of MIF in experimental models of sepsisMacrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is required to combat infection caused by facultative intracellular pathogens. Compared with wild-type mice, Mif-deficient mice have impaired production of the cytokines tumour-necrosis factor (TNF), interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and interleukin-12 (IL-12), resulting in a failure to eradicate Salmonella typhimurium and death from overwhelming sepsis (a). High levels of MIF expression are harmful during bacterial sepsis and toxic-shock syndromes. Administration of high doses of recombinant MIF to wild-type mice increases mortality in models of endotoxic (lipopolysaccharide, LPS-induced) shock and Escherichia coli sepsis (b). Mif-deficient mice are resistant to toxic shock induced by LPS or staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) (c). MIF-specific antibody protects wild-type mice from lethal bacterial sepsis (peritonitis caused by E. coli or caecal ligation and puncture, CLP) and toxic-shock syndromes induced by LPS or staphylococcal toxic-shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST1) (d). In the E. coli peritonitis model, improved survival is associated with reduced levels of TNF in the blood. Of note, mice with sepsis induced by CLP are protected even when treatment with MIF-specific antibody is delayed for up to 8 hours after the onset of infection.",

A clinical development programme of strategies using MIF-specific antibodies for the treatment of patients with sepsis is being carried out at present. Acute respiratory distress syndrome. Sepsis is a frequent cause of ARDS -the most severe and life-threatening form of acute lung injury. Disruption of the alveolar epithelium and of the microvascular endothelium, activation of neutrophils and cell death are important components of the inflammatory response that characterizes ARDS. In normal lungs, MIF is constitutively expressed by the bronchial epithelium, by the alveolar capillary endothelium and by alveolar macrophages41,74,85 . The expression of MIF is upregulated in patients with ARDS and it diffuses into the alveolar air spaces, where it enhances alveolar inflammatory responses74 . Immunoneutralization of MIF reduces the secretion of TNF and IL-8 in cultures of alveolar macrophages that are harvested from patients with ARDS. By contrast, addition of recombinant MIF enhances the release of TNF and IL-8 and so promotes the harmful pulmonary inflammatory response. As with peripheral-blood mononuclear cells and T cells, MIF was observed to counter-regulate the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids on cytokine secretion by cells of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with ARDS. In asthma -another model of acute lung inflammatory disease -stimulation of eosinophils with phorbol myristate acetate, C5a and IL-5 induced the immediate release of MIF. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids and sputum from patients with asthma were found to contain increased levels of MIF86,87 .MIF has emerged recently as an important effector molecule of the innate immune system. Unlike most cytokines, MIF is expressed constitutively by immune and endocrine cells, and also by the epithelial lining of tissues in direct contact with the external environment, indicating a role for MIF as a regulator of host responses to infection and stress. Consistent with this hypothesis, MIF was found to upregulate the expression of TLR4 by macrophages -the signal-transducing molecule of the receptor complex for endotoxins of Gram-negative bacteria. Microbial products and pro-inflammatory cytokines induced the release of preformed MIF, which functions as a regulator of innate and adaptive immune responses. Distinctive features of MIF include its capacity to counter-regulate the immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids on immune cells and to sustain proinflammatory functions by inhibiting p53-dependent apoptosis of macrophages. By its pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties, MIF contributes to the pathogenesis of severe sepsis, ARDS and autoimmune diseases, and high levels of MIF expression correlate with disease severity and poor outcome. Given the central place of MIF in the regulation of innate and acquired immunity, pharmacological or immunological modulation of MIF activity might offer new treatment options for patients with severe sepsis and inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. 2 | MIF in experimental models and human diseasesExperimental models in which MIF is an important mediator of pathogenesis\u2022 Sepsis and toxic-shock syndrome 7,8,60,66,72 , delayed-type hypersensitivity 88 , adjuvantand antigen-induced arthritis89,90 , glomerulonephritis[91][92][93][94] , acute lung injury 75 , allograft rejection 95 , inflammatory bowel disease (colitis)96,97 , gastrititis 98 , pancreatitis 99 , atherogenesis 100 , encephalomyelitis 101 and uveoretinitis102",
