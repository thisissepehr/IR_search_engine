Selenoproteins have a crucial role in the maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis in nearly all tissues, and are also involved in thyroid hormone metabolism, inflammation and immunity. Several immune processes rely on Se status and can be compromised if this element is present below the required level. Previous work has supported the notion that when Se is delivered at levels above those deemed to be the minimal required but below toxic concentrations it can have a boosting effect on the organism's immune response. Based on this concept Se-enriched supplements may represent a valuable resource for functional feeds in animal farming, including aquaculture. Results: In this study we tested the effects of Se supplemented as Sel-Plex during an immune challenge induced by polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that mimics viral infection. Trout were fed two diets enriched with 1 or 4 mg Se Kg \u22121 of feed (dry weight) by Sel-Plex addition and a commercial formulation as control. The whole trout transcriptomic response was investigated by microarray and gene ontology analysis, the latter carried out to highlight the biological processes that were influenced by Sel-Plex supplementation in the head kidney (HK) and liver, the main immune and metabolic organs in fish. Overall, Sel-Plex enrichement up to 4 mg Se Kg \u22121 induced an important response in the trout HK, eliciting an up-regulation of several genes involved in pathways connected with hematopoiesis and immunity. In contrast, a more constrained response was seen in the liver, with lipid metabolism being the main pathway altered by Se supplementation. Upon stimulation with poly(I:C), supplementation of 4 mg Se Kg \u22121 increased the expression of principal mediators of the antiviral defences, especially IFN-\u03b3, and down-stream molecules involved in the cell-mediated immune response. Conclusions: Supplementation of diets with 4 mg Se Kg \u22121 using Sel-Plex remarkably improved the fish response to viral PAMP stimulation. Sel-Plex, being a highly bioavailable supplement of organic Se, might represent a suitable option for supplementation of fish feeds, to achieve the final aim of improving fish fitness and resistance against immune challenges.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Background Selenium (Se) is an essential element in human and animal nutrition [1, 2] . Se deficiency is an endemic problem in several parts of the world, that can affect both human and livestock health. A low intake of this element can cause physiological dysfunction and may make the organism more susceptible either to infection or environmental stressors [3, 4] . Se supplementation in farmed animal feed may counteract problems caused by deficiency of this mineral but also ameliorate the physiological response to infection, inflammatory disorders and stress [5] . However, Se supplementation is still controversial, because 1) Se has a narrow range between nutritive requirements and toxicity, 2) nutritional requirements may vary considerably across species and 3) physiological conditions within an organism, as well as environmental factors, can influence the dietary needs for this mineral.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 79, "end": 82, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 83, "end": 85, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 359, "end": 362, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 363, "end": 365, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 565, "end": 568, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Previous studies suggest that fish require between 0.1 and 0.5 mg Kg \u22121 Se (dry mass): according to these data, fish can regulate Se bioaccumulation through excretion up to 3 mg Kg\u02c91 (dry mass) but beyond this level Se starts to exert detrimental effects [6] [7] [8] . In accordance with these studies, the European Union has legislated that if additional Se is added to feed, the total level must not exceed 0.5 mg Kg \u22121 (dry mass) (Commission Regulation EU No 432/2012).

In line with this reasoning, a recent study carried out in sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) showed that fish may benefit from organic Se supplementation up to 5 mg Kg \u22121 (dry mass) in the diet during larval development, due to enhanced antioxidant protection during muscle development [10] . Other investigations in trout have shown that farmed fish may require a higher content of Se in their diet, especially when subjected to stress caused by crowded conditions.

Tight control of radical oxygen species (ROS) produced during an immune challenge is crucial to guarantee effective responses to pathogens. ROS are generated in the early stage of immune activation and they function as mediators of intracellular signalling, as well as paracrine messengers for immune cell recruitment [15] . ROS also have a microbial killing function in phagocytic leukocytes, such as macrophages and neutrophils, i.e. via the oxidative burst [16] . However, oxygen radicals at high levels are cytotoxic bioproducts capable of damaging lipids, proteins and nucleic acids [17] . Se incorporated within selenoproteins exerts its antioxidant activity by maintaining the balance between the positive and negative effects of ROS [14] . Other selenoproteins, strictly related to inflammation and immunity, include the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane proteins selenoprotein K (SelK) and S (SelS), which are both involved in protection of cells towards ER stress.

In this context, Se-enriched feed additives have become an attractive resource for formulation of functional feeds for animal farming, including aquaculture. However, the use of Se supplementation to improve farmed fish defences towards infections is still controversial, since it is difficult to determine in different species which level can be beneficial before detrimental effects due to Se toxicity occur. From our previous study in rainbow trout [20] it was clear that Se supplemented as Seyeast (Sel-Plex) is well absorbed up to 8 mg Se Kg \u22121 (dry mass) without causing any evident sign of toxicity. In addition the metabolic response of trout to Sel-Plex shows a clear change in the profile of selenocompound accumulation with increasing concentration of Sel-Plex inclusion: at concentrations \u2265 4 mg Se Kg \u22121 there was evident accumulation of selenocysteine (SeCys) over SeMet, which may account for the higher selenoprotein synthesis (Lawan, pers observation).

The mode of action of many fish viruses during infection is still under investigation, and there is a continuous effort to find possible solutions to enhance fish natural defences. Functional feeds might represent an alternative to improve fish natural defences. They are particular diet compositions, containing substitutes or supplements with the aim to improve fish fitness and immune defences. Elements such as Se, provided at supranutitional levels and below toxic concentrations, might represent a natural and sustainable solution to improve fish health. In our previous study [20] we proposed that fish, salmonids in particular, may require higher levels of Se compared to mammals and more than current legislation allows (0.5 mg Kg \u22121 dry mass). We showed that Se delivered as Sel-Plex to reach supplementation levels between~5-9 mg Se Kg \u22121 , is well absorbed and might improve selenoprotein synthesis.

To this end, we carried out a transcriptomic analysis by microarray on both liver and HK from rainbow trout challenged with this viral mimic after being fed a diet enriched with Sel-Plex. After a first qPCR screening a slight but significant induction of selenoprotein transcripts was seen in the liver of the group supplemented with 4 mg Se Kg \u22121 . Interestingly in the same experimental group a significant increase of type-II IFN (especially IFN-\u03b32) was also detected, with downstream molecules such as CXCL11 and viperin following the same trend.

Hence, in taking this approach there was a risk that only partial information would be retrieved from the transcriptomic analysis, but as the human genome remains the most annotated, it gave the possibility to carry out a more extensive analysis. It also allowed use of more bioinformatic tools, giving the possibility of a more flexible analytical approach. For example, for the GO analysis, ClueGO allowed the upregulated and down-regulated transcripts to be analysed together and to determine the contribution of the two clusters in the biological pathways found altered in each of the contrasts considered for this study. It was not possible to perform a network analysis for the processes modulated in liver, mainly due to the small set of mRNAs found altered by the treatment. Overall the response of this organ to the diet was relatively mild. Only a small set of transcripts (20 targets) was processed by the GO analysis, and the main terms were involved in lipid and steroid metabolism. The possible effects of Se supplementation on fish metabolism of lipids, especially steroid and fatty acids, might be an intriguing aspect to investigate further. Should Se be able to increase the fillet nutritional value, for example by improving the content of omega-3 fatty acids, it could have an important impact on human nutrition and fish food marketing. Lipid metabolism can also influence the fish immune response. Recent findings have shown that cholesterol, specifically oxidized derivates such as 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), are important mediators during the innate response to pathogens. During virus infection, TLR-mediated signalling in macrophages triggers the induction of an IFN response, which promotes the production of 25HC mediated by STAT1; in turn this oxysterol can act on multiple levels as a potent paracrine inhibitor of viral infection for a broad range of viruses [43] . The present results suggest that Sel-Plex supplementation is able to modulate liver lipid metabolism and increase cholesterol production, possibly enhancing the innate immune response against viral infections.

These three processes are tightly connected. IFN-\u03b3 production is controlled by cytokines secreted from antigen presenting cells (APCs), most notably IL-12 and IL-18; these cytokines serve as a bridge to link infection with IFN-\u03b3 production in the innate immune response. Macrophage recognition of many pathogens induces secretion of IL-12 and chemokines, which in turn attract natural killer (NK) cells to the site of inflammation, and IL-12 promotes IFN-\u03b3 synthesis in these cells.

Vitamin and mineral composition in the raw material for all diets used in this study. (PDF 61 kb) Additional file 4: Table S2 . Real time qPCR analysis of genes selected for confirmation of microarray data. Candidate transcripts expression in HK (A) and liver (B) RNA isolated from rainbow trout fed a control diet (CTRL) or a diet enriched with 4 mg Se Kg \u22121 (Sel-Plex), and injected with either PBS or poly(I:C). The expression of gene transcripts was quantified by qPCR and normalized against the geometric mean of three housekeeping genes (ef-1\u03b1, drpII, hprt) from the same samples, and then used for statistical analysis. The transcript expression is reported as a fold change, calculated as the average expression level of stimulated samples divided by that of the controls. The results represent the mean \u00b1 SEM from five pools of HK or liver RNA extracted from 3 individuals from 3 different tanks. The letters above the columns indicate values that are statistically significant vs the controls (p < 0.05) in the group injected with poly(I:C), with different letters indicating significant differences between the two diet regimes. Asterisks indicate values that are statistically significant vs the control (p < 0.05) in the group fed 4 mg Se Kg \u22121 and injected with PBS. The primers used are listed in Table 2 . (PDF 173 kb) Additional file 5: Figure S3 . Grouped annotation network (A) and cluster distribution network (B) of the functional terms listed in Fig. 7 visualised using ClueGO. In both layouts, terms are connected depending on the similarity of their associated genes. The degree of connectivity between terms (edges) is calculated using kappa statistics and the network is shown using the Organic layout algorithm supported by Cytoscape. The size of the nodes reflects the statistical significance of the terms, whereas the thickness of the edge reflects the grade of functional connection between terms. The group leading term is the most significant term of the group. In the grouped annotation network, functional terms are grouped by different colours, each identifying the most significant term of the group. In the cluster distribution network, green and red label functional terms are up-and down-regulated genes, respectively. The colour gradient shows the gene proportion of each cluster associated with the term. (PDF 1254 kb) Additional file 6: Table S3 . List of transcripts showing the highest change in the HK of fish injected with poly(I:C) and dependent on prior feeding regime. The selection was based on the results of the GO analysis (Fig. 7) . All the genes with corresponding microarray feature code 1 found involved in a biological process significantly altered by the experimental diet in the HK were selected. If the transcripts were significantly modulated also in fish fed the experimental diet enriched with 4 mg Se Kg \u22121 by adding Sel-Plex and injected with poly(I:C) 3 , or in the same tissue of fish fed the control diet and injected with poly(I:C) 4 , these values are given. Also the fold change of the expression of the same targets between these last two groups is reported, as given from Genespring software 5 . All the transcripts shown were significantly modulated at p < 0.05 following the Benjamini-Hochberg correction and had a fold change \u22652. Accession numbers of the cDNA sequence 6 , their identity 7 and the corresponding human orthologue 8 determined by BLASTx within the Ensemble database are reported. For each gene the function assigned by ClueGO software is also indicated. SeC represents the groups comparison addressed to analyse the effects of the diet enriched with 4 mg Se Kg \u22121 . CP and SeP instead represent the comparisons addressed to analyse the effect of poly(I:C) stimulation on fish fed either a control diet or the experimental diet respectively.
