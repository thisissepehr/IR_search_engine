Our results show the usefulness of synthetic peptides as potential antigens for the development of a new GBV-C antibody peptide-based microarray for diagnosis in HIV-1-infected patients. The 11 peptides selected in this GBV-C E2 protein antigenic study identified anti-E2 GBV-C antibodies among HIV-1-infected patients, establishing a reactivity of 47 %. Furthermore, these results reinforce the need for a combination of potentially antigenic epitopes of different GBV-C E2 domains to achieve a more accurate and precise diagnostic system.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF30": {"ref_id": "b30", "title": "Stata Statistical Software: Release 12.
