Cooksley 1 1 The Christie NHS Trust-Manchester-United Kingdom, Department of Acute Medicine and Critical Care, Liverpool, United Kingdom Checkpoint inhibitors have significantly improved outcomes for patients in a number of malignancies. These treatments are associated with toxicities which stem from increased activity within T cell lineage similar to that observed in autoimmunity. These immune-mediated toxicities can affect virtually any organ system and are potentially fatal. The timing of the onset of the adverse events is dependent on the organ system affected and can be delayed significantly after initiation or completion of therapy. The critical first step in the management of immune-mediated toxicities is their recognition. The increasing indications for, and usage of, checkpoint inhibitors means that more patients on these therapies will present to emergency settings. Determining if these patients have an immunemediated toxicity requires careful clinical workup and necessitates education of health care professionals working in acute care settings. Early recognition and intervention can reduce the duration and severity of the complications. This necessitates that consideration is given to the models of acute care utilised in the emergency management of patients on checkpoint inhibitors.",

This suggests that cachexia is indeed a multi-organ syndrome. However, none of the numerous existing definitions of cachexia include the fact that cachexia is a \"multi-organ\" syndrome. Indeed, many different cell types are involved in cachexia. Current definitions put special emphasis on skeletal muscle and adipose tissue but we now know of the uttermost importance of other organs/tissues in the wasting syndrome. The implications of this are important since, on the one hand, the metabolic alterations affecting all cellular types may be very relevant for the understanding of the cachexia syndrome and, secondly, the development of new therapeutic approaches may benefit from this knowledge: for instance it may be relevant to interfere with lypolysis of with acute-phase protein synthesis to block muscle proteolysis. Therefore, future studies on this field are needed and should concentrate on unrevealing the different mediators released by non-muscle tissues that may influence muscle metabolism and, therefore, wasting. Furthermore, another important aspect that future research should contemplate is to establish the chronological involvement of the different organs/tissues in cancer cachexia. Introduction Photobiomodulation (PBM) has shown efficacy in preventing and treating cancer therapy-induced mucositis and/or dermatitis. However, there is a dearth of information regarding the effect of PBM on (pre)malignant cells, which has led to questions regarding the safety of this technique. We address this issue in an orthotopic mouse model with human squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity.",

The presenter will review basic nerve fiber physiology and neurotoxic drug-specific pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying painful and non-painful symptoms. CIPN leads to several unfortunate outcomes, and the presenter will describe how patient and clinician-related assessment barriers lead to under-assessed and poorly managed CIPN symptoms. The presenter will describe three general measurement approaches and provide examples of each. These approaches include (1) objective assessment approaches such as physical examination, nerve conduction studies, and quantitative sensory testing, (2) functional measures such as the Timed Get Up & Go test, and (3) subjective patientreported outcome measures such as the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy Scale (CIPN20). The presenter will review the available evidence supporting the strength of all these measures, including composite measures such as the Total Neuropathy Score, and Grading Scales. This discussion will include a review of the most cogent information regarding measurement reliability, validity, responsiveness, sensitivity, and feasibility. The presentation will conclude with recommendations for how to best measure CIPN in both research and clinical practice settings. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a prominent clinical problem caused by multiple cytotoxic agents. Given that gabapentinoid medications have been commonly utilized in clinical practice for treatment of CIPN, it is appropriate to critically look at the oncology literature regarding the utility of gabapentin and/or pregabalin for prevention and/or treatment of CIPN. The first known report regarding the use of gabapentin for chemotherapyinduced neuropathy came from Italian authors at the 2000 ASCO annual meeting, entitled 'Oxaliplatin-induced Neuropathy: Could Gabapentin be the Answer?'. This report described the use of gabapentin in 7 patients who developed neuropathy while receiving oxaliplatin. With the initiation of neuropathy, gabapentin was given, at a total daily dose of 200-300 mg per day; this remarkably low dose reportedly led to the disappearance of neuropathy symptoms, even with the ongoing use of up to 14 total oxaliplatin doses. This work is not available in manuscript form. Subsequent uncontrolled trial reports have not, on the whole, provided convincing evidence of gabapentinoid benefit for prevention/treatment of CIPN. Additionally, 3 randomized placebo-controlled reported trials have not provided good evidence of benefit for gabapentinoids. Despite a lack of good evidence that gabapentinoids are helpful for preventing/treating CIPN, arguments supporting the use of gabapentinoids for treating CIPN include: 1) they are beneficial in other neuropathy states, based on phase III data supporting use in such situations; 2) a few reports of clinical practice experiences and unblinded clinical trials suggest that they might be helpful for CIPN in some cases 3) anecdotal use in individual patients in clinical practice suggest that they appear to provide benefit in some individual patients; and 4) there are anecdotal reports of worsening neuropathy symptoms when gabapentinoids are discontinued (understanding that gabapentinoids can cause withdrawal symptoms when they are stopped).",

The last years have seen another revolution in treatment strategies in many solid tumours with the introduction of immune-checkpoint modulators. These antibodies targeting CTLA-1, PD-1 or PD-L1 counteract tumour-associated inhibition of T-cell activation, thereby aiming to generate an anti-tumour response. Indeed, these drugs have proven highly active in several disease entities such as melanoma, lung cancer, urothelial or renal cell cancer; clinical trials in breast cancer are currently ongoing with early promising results observed in triple-negative disease. By increasing T-cell activity, however, auto-immune reactions may result; this is a major issue especially with drugs targeting CTLA-4. While less pronounced with antibodies directed against PD-1 or PD-L1, side effects such as hypophysitis, thyroiditis, pneumonitis, adrenal gland insufficiency, hepatitis, guillain-barre syndrome or colitis may occur. As these toxicities are potentially life-threatening, early detection and treatment with corticosteroids is essential.",

Cognitive toxicity may pose substantial challenges for AYA cancer survivors who wish to resume or maintain their usual life, including school, work and other social aspects, after treatment.

Autophagy is important for PGRN's protective role in chondrocytes and OA. PGRN-mediated anabolism is largely lost in the presence of autophagy inhibitor BafA1 in human OA chondrocytes.BafA1 also inhibited PGRN's suppression on IL-1\u03b2-induced catabolic metabolism in OA chondrocyte.We generated DMM OA model in 4 months-old mice,followed by intra-articular injection of PBS,PGRN(6\u03bcg) with or without BafA1(5ug) once a week.Recombinant PGRN clearly protected against OA progression in surgically induced OA models,and intraarticular injection of BafA1 significantly suppressed PGRN's protective effect (Fig. 3) .It is demonstrated that autophagy regulated by PGRN contributes to its chondroprotective effect against OA.Mechanistic studies demonstrate that PGRN regulates autophagy through direct interaction with ATG5-ATG12(data not shown).",

No significant differences of levels of FCR and fatigue in patients with different treatment status (active treatment vs. survivors) and cancer stage. FCR was significant positively associated with average fatigue(r =.25, p=.013) and patients with higher level of fear of recurrence (>= 13) had significant higher than level of average fatigue than patients with lower level than 13. Conclusions Colorectal cancer patients with higher level of fear of recurrence had the higher level of fatigue in average. Therefore, decreasing the level of fear of recurrence might be an important factor to help colorectal cancer patients in managing fatigue effectively. However, their causal effect needs to identify in the further study. ",

Exact concordance between CGS and GWAS/BN was demonstrated for ERK and PTK6 signaling and TGF-\u03b2 pathway. Overlap was observed for TGF-\u03b2 signaling, Wnt signaling, inflammatory response pathway, response to organic substance, and ATPase binding/activity. GWAS/BN studies independently identified an additional 14 pathways, 19 biological processes, and 19 ontological functions. Four studies included independent validation cohorts. Conclusions CGS and GWAS have contributed to the identification of genomic mucositis risk prediction.

GLABRATA, C. KEFYR AND P. GINGIVALIS Introduction Both bacteria and fungi play a role in oral mucositis after chemo-and/or radiotherapy. In a previous study we showed that Porphyromonas gingivalis, Candida glabrata and Candida kefyr strongly inhibited wound closure in an in vitro scratch assay model. The question that remains to be elucidated is if this is caused by reduced cell migration or by reduced ability of cells to grow. Objectives Our aim was to study the reproductive capacity of oral epithelial cells when challenged with P. gingivalis, C. glabrata and C. kefyr. Methods A clonogenic assay in vitro was used. Oral epithelial cells (CA 922) were cultured and seeded in 6-well plates. Micro-organisms were added to the wells in different concentrations; mono-infections or mixed together. After one day the bacteria were removed and after seven days the epithelial cells were coloured with crystalviolet. Finally the colonies of oral epithelial cells that formed were counted using a stereomicroscope. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to determine any differences in reproductive capacity of the epithelial cells under different bacterial conditions.",

Body weight (BW) and intestinal parameters were explored; including intestinal weight, morphometry, histological analysis of mucositis severity and activity of myeloperoxidase Results Agonist treatment resulted in an increase in relative small intestinal weight (p<0.0001). The concentration of intact GLP-1 and GLP-2 was increased in colonic tissue (p<0.01). Agonist treatment of 5-FU mice resulted in an increase in villus height (p<0.05) ( Fig. 1 A) and crypth depth, a decrease in histological severity score ( Fig. 1 B) , a decrease in body weight loss 48h after 5-FU and a decrease in myeloperoxidase activity",

We then combined scheduled lorazepam and haloperidol, as we suspected benzodiazepine withdrawal may have been contributing to the patient's delirium. Addition of lorazepam appeared to improve control of agitation; however, both the nursing staff and family at the bedside reported worsening agitation after haloperidol administration.

In this pilot study, we evaluated the molecular characteristics associated with paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PIPN). Objectives Compare differential gene expression (GE) between breast cancer (BC) survivors with and without PIPN. Methods GE in peripheral blood was assayed using RNA-seq. Differentially expressed (DE) genes and pathways were identified between survivors who received paclitaxel and did (n=25) and did not (n=25) develop PIPN. Results BC survivors with PIPN were significantly older; more likely to be unemployed; reported lower alcohol use; had a higher BMI, and poorer functional status; and had a higher number of lower extremity sites with loss of light touch, cold, and pain sensations, and higher vibration thresholds. No between group differences were found in the total dose of paclitaxel received or in the percentage of patients who had a dose reduction or delay due to PIPN. We found 140 DE genes and 21 DE pathways (e.g., signaling (PI3K/AKT, mTOR), oxidative stress (p53 signaling), and mitochondrial impairment (Mitophagy -animals)).",

Objectives For that, I want to research the possibility of involving certain viruses. Most leukemias are discovered by an infectious process Methods I believe that a screening test would be useful regarding common infection (for exemple: Influenza virus, coronavirus, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, herpes simplex virus, HTLV). We make serological screening for usual infections, but we don't make screening for the viruses described above. A molecular analysis it would help us more. The number of samples available is 25 and the number anticipated in one year is 50 Results To prove that a screening test would be useful regarding common infection.",

Risk factors for FN among pts with B-NHL treated with R-CHOP were 65 years or older (p = 0.0205), albumin <35 g/L (p = 0.0093), and lack of prophylactic daily GCSF (p < 0.0001) and peg-GCSF (p < 0.0001) in cycle 1, and albumin <35 g/L (p = 0.0589) and hemoglobin <12g/dL (p = 0.0133) throughout all cycles. Conclusions At 10.5% in cycle 1 and 13.0% throughout all cycles, the incidence of FN was almost the same previously we reported.

Objectives Combine three study databases with identical methodologies to investigate TSA in treatment-na\u00efve and advanced cancer. Determine associations between TSA and malnutrition risk, nutritional impact symptoms (NIS) and QoL. Methods Study datasets were pooled and analysed (Table 1) TSA prevalence was 76% but depends on assessment type. The most common abnormalities were persistent bad taste (52%) and stronger or weaker perception of taste (48%) and smell (30%). Sweet acuity was most commonly stronger (24%) and salt mostly weaker (14%). TSA severity correlated with lower QoL (r =.451, p<0.01). Over half (64%) were at malnutrition risk. TSAwere significantly associated with NIS (dry mouth, early satiety, fatigue, lack of appetite), malnutrition risk and reduced intake. Conclusions TSA prevalence was high, but varied by assessment method. Over half of participants had persistent bad taste. Those with TSA were more likely to have NIS, be at malnutrition risk and eat less.

Objectives To develop and usability test an information intervention for parents of children with ALL. Methods HELP incorporates text, links to resources and videos filmed with health professionals (HCPs) and parents. It was developed using a stepwise approach. An initial prototype of HELP was used to inform meetings with HCPs and parents. Feasibility testing was conducted with a diverse group of HCPs and two parent representatives. Parents of children with ALL (n=7) were recruited to undertake usability testing: incorporating thinking aloud while navigating HELP and the System Usability Scale questionnaire. HELP underwent two periods of refinement. Results Initial development of HELP was slow, engaging and recruiting HCPs was challenging. Filming videos with parents and HCPs, proved worthwhile as parents responded favourably to videos during usability testing. Data reports on user performance and parent satisfaction were collected. These were positive about content, less regarding style. Overall, parents stated that they would have found the resource useful.",

            "text": "Although research into adult bereavement begun more than a century ago, it is only in recent years, in the West, that there has been a growing professional and public awareness of the needs of bereaved children. We now know, for instance, that when the death of o parent is antcipated, children's bereavement may be affected by a number of factors, including the duration of the previous illness of the deceased parent, advance knowledge of the impending death as well as the degree of the child's awareness of the parent's death. The first intra-psychic theory of grief was proposed by Freud (1917) and has stood as a precedent for scientific research into grief today. Lindemann's classic study of survivors of the Coconut Grove fire in Boston (1944) described adult grief as having both somatic and psychological effects, where distress, preoccupation with the deceased, guilty, anger, and loss of usual living were experienced. Conclusions Bereavement theories developed from research into bereaved adults would also appear relevant for bereaved children. Antibiotics are recommended to be continued till count recovery (CR) anticipating the development of recurrent fever (RF). The factors that predict recurrence of fever following defervescence (DS) during febrile neutropenia episode (FNE) have not been studied.",

Boundaries between supportive oncology and palliative medicine are often blurred. The timing at which the patient is introduced to these services (with supportive oncology bieng the earlier of the two) and the differences in the primary providers (supportive oncology is usually considered the domain of medical oncologists) constitute the thin line of demarcation between the two. Conclusions Introduction of the palliative medicine expert to the patients family at an earlier stage in the illness, his active involvement during the daily multispeciality oncology rounds, expanding his role to include management of medical issues such as side effects of chemotherapy( nausea, peripheral neuropathy, diarrhoea) may make palliative medicine more accessible to the patient and his family. It might go a long way in making the involvement of this expert acceptable at the later stage in the disease trajectory and negate the apprehension associated with such a referral. ",

Objectives To gain insight into differences between early and late involvement and the effect on existing working procedures and skills as perceived by PHC teams. Methods Six focus groups were held with PHC teams in Flanders, Belgium. The discussions were transcribed verbatim and analysed using the method of constant comparative analysis. Results Differences were found concerning 1) reasons for initiation, 2) follow-up of the care, 3) focus on possibilities versus problems, 4) opportunity to provide holistic care, 5) empowerment of patients, and 6) empowerment of professional caregivers. A shift from a medical approach to a more holistic approach is the most noticeable. Being involved earlier also results in a more structured follow-up and in empowering the patient to be part of the decision-making process. Early involvement creates the need for transmural collaboration, which leads to the teams taking on more supporting and coordinating tasks. Conclusions Being involved earlier leads to different tasks and working procedures and to the need for transmural collaboration. Future research might focus on the development of an intervention model for the early integration of PHC into oncology care. To develop this model, components of existing models might need to be adapted or extended.",

There are fewer patients who prefer not to know and their reasons include: disclosure can cause them psychological and emotional distress, and it may be meaningless and could not give help to them. Some patients believe that what they don't know cannot hurt them. Thus, they prefer not to be informed of the gravity of their sickness. Filipinos, specifically tend to leave things up to fate or destiny, thinking that everything happens for a reason; and these includes their illness and anticipated death.

While breast cancer is a high-profile disease, receiving significant research funding and prevention initiatives, patients with metastatic breast cancer face unique challenges. Public messaging about a \"cure\" is so pervasive that people diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer can be stigmatized by the perception that they've failed to take care of themselves. Objectives Expand the current breast cancer conversation to address gaps between early and metastatic disease and improve the treatment and management of metastatic breast cancer in the community setting. Address the communication challenges that cancer care teams face such as: Patientperception that their cancer is curable, patient level of engagement during conversations with providers, providers who may \"minimize\" the severity of the disease, and lack of awareness of available resources. Methods An environmental scan was completed. An expert advisory panel was formed. 5 different community cancer centers completed in-depth focus groups on their care path. Results A process improvement workbook was created with a map of care from metastatic diagnosis through end of life. Relevant resources were attributed to five stages: Diagnosis, Current Treatment, Monitoring Treatment, Treatment Failure, Hospice. Six principles were identified and assigned: Empower the patient, reframe the conversation, reduce patient isolation, offer logistical support, connect patients with support in the community, and collaborate in the interest of patients.",

Patients want their doctor to acknowledge that despite scientific knowledge, medicine cannot predict the future.

Methods Patients undergoing prostate biopsy were randomised to receive either a standard biopsy instruction sheet (Control) or an information booklet about PCa treatment options in addition to the instruction sheet (Intervention). Ninety-eight patients completed validated Depression, Anxiety and Distress measures pre-biopsy and after receiving their biopsy results.

However, little is known about the psychological distress and concerns among patients with hepatocellular cancer. Objectives This cross sectional descriptive study aimed to describe the prevalence of anxiety and depression in cancer patients with hepatocellular cancer. Methods Inclusion criteria were: individuals over the age of 20 who had a diagnosis of advanced or terminal hepatocellular cancer based on Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system, who were aware of their diagnosis, and who had sufficient physical and mental stability. Eligible patients were invited to complete the questionnaires including the demographic questionnaire and HADS questionnaire. Furthermore, clinical data were reviewed and collected from medical information record. Open-end questions to reflect concerns was used to gather sample's concerns. Mean, standard deviations, range, frequency and percentage were calculated for descriptive purposes. Content analysis was used. Results A total of 96 patients ranged in age from 32 to 83 years, mostly male (82.29%). Majority (76.04%) of sample were Buddhist. No patients had normal psychological state, 29 (30.2%) broader line anxiety, 67 (69.8%) with definite anxiety and these rates were seen in 32 (33.3%), 64 (66.7%) for depression, respectively. Psychological concerns were related to family life plan, distressful symptoms, social isolation, and the curable treatments. Conclusions Anxiety and depression are common psychological distress experienced by patients with advanced hepatocellular cancer. The findings highlight the needs for regularly psychological screening and intervention for patients with advanced hepatocellular cancer.

These findings merit further exploration into patient selection for early phase trials. Introduction Neratinib (HKI-272), a novel pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitor(TKI) against HER2-amplified breast cancers, is currently being tested in a number of trials for its clinical activity. Objectives To systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of neratinib with available phase I, II, and III data, and elaborate on the safety profile of pan-HER TKIs. Methods A comprehensive search of PubMed, Medline, Embase was performed for all relevant clinical trials. Adverse events (AE) of any grades and grades\u22653 were summarized for event rates. Odd ratios (ORs) were calculated for controlled trials. A random effect model was applied if heterogeneity was observed (P < 0.10 or I\u00b2 > 50%). Progression free survival (PFS) was measured with hazard ratio (HR) extracted from Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Results 4665 patients from 19 articles were included in the analyses. The most frequently occurred all-grade AEs of neratinib monotherapy was diarrhea(88.0%), nausea(42.4%) and fatigue(26.3%). The frequency of grade\u22653 diarrhea was significantly higher than control (OR=11.969, 95% CI 6.441-22.244).The common adverse events of neratinibpaclitaxel-combined therapy included diarrhea(77.7%), nausea(57.2%), neutropenia(31.5%), anemia(31,5%) and stomatitis(27.6%). For neratinib plus paclitaxel therapy, 29.4% of patients presented with peripheral sensory neuropathy and 50.7% with alopecia.

Methods MMA delivery started in January 2015 with 12-week community-based physical activity groups of moderate-intensity and high-intensity. The cancer and physical activity standard evaluation framework (CaPASEF) was used to measure physical activity levels, fatigue and quality of life at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. A 6-minute walk test, sit-to-stand test and hand grip strength test were later introduced at baseline and 12 weeks to assess MMA's impact on cardiorespiratory fitness, strength and mobility. Results MMA has generated 380 referrals to date. Referrals were highest for prostate (25%), breast (24%), bowel (9%) and lung (7%) cancer. MMA has demonstrated a long-term increase in physical activity levels (P<0.01), decrease in fatigue (P<0.05) and improvement in quality of life (P<0.05) for participants. Results from objective measurements will be available in May 2018. Conclusions MMA has successfully supported PLWC into a lifestyle of long-term, independent physical activity for health.

Low-intensity exercise therapy (LIET) is often adopted in cases where chemotherapeutic side effects preclude more intensive exercises. However, it remains unclear whether LIET is effective in patients with hematologic malignancies. Objectives To investigate the effects of LIET on the physical and mental symptoms and functions, in patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing chemotherapy. Methods Forty-four patients hospitalized for chemotherapy performed LIET. The exercise intensity of LIET was defined as achieving <40% of the predicted maximum heart rate calculated using the Karvonen formula. LIET consisted of 20-40 minutes of walking and resistance training, per day. LIET frequency was adjusted according to the patient's condition. Muscular and physical function, activities of daily living (ADLs), psychological distress, and quality of life (QOL) were evaluated upon initiation of rehabilitation and at discharge.

Objectives Oxaliplatin produces long term side effects, like peripheral neuropathy and liver injury as Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome (SOS). Since a considerable number of patients with colorectal cancer treated with adjuvant oxaliplatin based chemotherapy will be cured, we designed the following study to search the effects of oxaliplatin based chemotherapy on gene expression of peripheral leukocytes with the following aims: 1) to assess the effects of the therapy on gene expression; 2) to stablish correlations among gene expression variation and SOS, and 3) to search for molecular markers of long term toxicity. Methods Peripheral leukocytes from 27 patients with colon adenocarcinoma, scheduled to receive adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, were isolated with Ficoll-Hypaque gradient, previously and after three FOLFOX-or CAPEOX-cycles (OX). We isolated mRNA from leukocytes from 27 patients in both situations, prior-and post-three cycles treatment and the expression of selected genes was measured by qRT-PCR. Patients entering the study had normal liver functions test and signed informed contest. Clinical examination, laboratory tests and imaging studies were performed as indicated in clinical guide lines. Results OX chemotherapy varied AIF1, AGAP1, ROMO1, LMNA, SESN1, THBS1 and SERPINH1 genes expression in a manner that correlates with SOS laboratory parameters (bilirubin, AST, ALT, GGT, AP LDH, Hb and platelets) and imaging studies Conclusions These genes could be used as early markers and evolution markers of SOS.

Highest recognition of exercise effect was \"improvement of sleep\" (72.3%), followed by \"improvement of physical functions\" (70.9%), and \"prevention of falling\" (70.2%). Low recognition items were \"alleviation of fatigue\" (36.1%), \"alleviation of pain\" (41.2%), and \"recurrence prevention\" patients (46.1%). 122 patients (90.4%) need various exercise supports, such as \"exercises with family\" and \"exercise facilities for cancer survivors.\" Conclusions The breast cancer survivors recognize that the exercise improves the lifestyle, but does not recognize that exercise relieves a symptom and prevents recurrence of cancer very much. Since 90% of breast cancer survivors need exercise support, it was suggested that transmission of right information about the exercise and the development of the exercise support program were necessary.",

Methods C57BL/6 mice were injected (i.p.) with AOM, followed by three DSS/water cycles (seven days DSS, 14 days water) ad libitum. Mice (n=9/group) were orally-administered water or EO (80\u03bcL or 160\u03bcL) thrice weekly for nine weeks. Bodyweight and disease activity index (DAI) were measured daily. Burrowing activity and colitis progression were analyzed throughout the trial. At sacrifice, tumor number and size were recorded. Results AOM/DSS induced significant bodyweight loss (24%; p<0.05) compared to normal controls which was attenuated following EO-treatment (maximum bodyweight loss; 80\u03bcL: 7%; 160\u03bcL: 11%; p<0.05). EO reduced DAI of AOM/DSS animals (20%; p<0.05). Burrowing activity was impaired by AOM/DSS on days 48 and 61 (p<0.05); an effect that was restored by EO on day 61 (p<0.05). Additionally, EO ameliorated colonoscopically-assessed colitis severity compared to AOM/DSS controls (p<0.05). EO-treatment (80\u03bcL) resulted in fewer small tumors in CA-CRC treated mice (p<0.05) compared to AOM/DSS controls. Finally, EO in normal mice did not elicit any demonstrable effect. Conclusions EO improved clinical indicators of colitis and reduced the number of small colonic tumors in CA-CRC mice, suggesting potential for EO application in colitis-and colon cancer-management.

Results 222 participants completed the questionnaire. The total scores of colleague solidarity, occupational commitment, and turnover intention were 91.29\u00b1 9.29, 87.56\u00b114.25, 9.29 \u00b14.00. There was a significant negative correlation between colleague solidarity(r=-0.269, p=0.000), occupational commitment(r=-0.550, p=0.000) and turnover intention. Negative colleague solidarity, opportunity commitment and the whole occupational commitment entered the multiple regression equation and explained 36.1% of the variance of oncology nurses' turnover intention level. Conclusions Chinese oncology nurses have moderate level of colleague solidarity, opportunity commitment and low level of turnover intention, and there were negative connections among these variables. Nursing managers are advised to pay attention to nurses with negative opinions about nursing work, improve their colleague solidarity, and promote occupational commitment, which may in turn decrease turnover intention.

Introduction Introduction: In the Occident, female breasts symbolize femininity and sexuality. Thus, breast cancer becomes stigmatizing for women. Objectives Aim: To know the meaning of the breast cancer for women who have experienced the disease. Methods Method: It is a qualitative study, which used Symbolic Interactionism and Grounded Theory. The data collection occurred in January 2014. Thirteen women, who attended a Brazilian hospital, were interviewed through semi-structured interviews, recorded, guided by the guiding question: \"What is the meaning of being diagnosed with breast cancer? Results Results: Meanings: 1) Fear of death, feeling of sadness by the loss of breast and concern with alopecia. 2) Sequelae of treatment, such as difficulty in performing tasks, altered family structure, and autonomy deficit; the loss of hair (chemotherapy) referred to the image of a \"naked body\", \"disfigured face\", but also meant a passing and necessary event for healing. 3) Concern in making use of hormonal therapy, examinations, and medical consultation to follow the disease, and, with their daughters, because of the heredity of the disease. 4) Previous negative experiences related to cancer, such as death of an loved one, meant a more suffering coping of the current disease; positive experiences, such as experiencing the recovery of a person with cancer provided better coping of the disease. Conclusions Conclusion: To have breast cancer had a frightening meaning, and caused important changes in the daily lives of theses women. But, to have experienced a previous (positive) experience with cancer meant a better coping of the disease. ",

Animations and podcasts about cancer and different treatments and practical guidelines as route directions were developed. An app was built with three informational parts: 1) Before, during and after treatment. This part is available for all patients (Nice to know). 2) My material. This part is tailored to each individual patient (Need to know). 3) FAQ, Frequently asked questions. Furthermore, the app can include Patients Reported Outcome measures.

Hui 1 1 University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Palliative Care, Houston, USA Over the past 5 decades, palliative care has evolved from serving patients at the end-of-life to a highly specialized profession to delivering supportive care to patients with life-limiting illnesses throughout the disease trajectory. There is now a growing body of evidence to inform the key domains in the practice of palliative care, including symptom management, psychosocial care, communication, decision making, and end-of-life care. One of the most important roles of palliative care is to facilitate serious illness conversations to facilitate complex decision making, especially when patients are approaching the end-of-life. In the past few years, there has been a tremendous amount of new literature on this topic, demonstrating improved outcomes with prognostic discussions and care planning. In this presentation, we will review emerging prognostication tools to facilitate clinical practice, including (1) novel prognostic markers, (2) machine learning approaches, (3) internet based prognostic calculators, and (4) decision making tools. We will also discuss the need to standardize statistical analysis and reporting to move the field of prognostication forward.",

Despite the fact that death from cancer is statistically common, family members often encounter the death as an unexpected event. Caregivers who reported they were relatively unprepared have shown poor bereavement outcomes, in both elevated depressive symptoms and bereavement-specific distress, such as prolonged grief symptoms. A few studies have documented that caregivers who report that health care professionals managed the patients' pain and physical ailments well, provided clear information about the patients' prognosis, and were available for the family caregivers prior to the death of the patient have reported better adjustment during end-of-life care and bereavement. Key components of effective communications that help family members prepare for impending death of their loved one, which would also be associated with better longer term adjustment to bereavement, will be discussed.

The literature suggests that in the last year of life transition to palliative care is late or non-existent for HO patients, potentially resulting in their care being compromised (Alt-Epping et al 2011); with many dying in hospital (Howell et al 2010 b). In contrast national guidance states that the HO patient should receive an early integration to palliative care services (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence 2003, 2004). Various reasons have been cited as affecting the integration of palliative care services (Manitta et al 2010).

Joly 18IntroductionEpithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) prognosis remains poor but \u226540% of patients can have long survival. EOC and its treatments are deleterious on long term Quality-of-Life (QoL): fatigue, physical, functional disorders and various symptoms. Few data exist on QoL among EOC Survivors (EOCS).ObjectivesWe conducted a case-control study comparing severe fatigue and QoL between EOCS without relapse \u22653 years after first-line chemotherapy and age-matched healthy women. Methods Controls from whole population and EOCS from 27 French centers completed validated self-questionnaires: Fatigue, QoL, neurotoxicity (FACT/F,FACT/G,FACT/O-TOI,FACT/Ntx), anxiety/depression (HADS), sleep disturbance (ISI), physical activity (IPAQ). Severe fatigue was defined by FACT-F score<37 and sensitive neuropathy using the 6 dedicated FACT/Ntx items. Results 318 pairs were analyzed. Median age: 65 (20-86). FIGO stage: (I/II=49%, III/IV=47%). Years from chemotherapy end (mean=6\u00b13). EOCS experienced more frequently severe fatigue (26% vs 13%, p=0.0004) and poor quality-of-sleep (63% vs 47%, p=0.0003). Similarly, EOCS reported lower functional wellbeing score (17.5 vs 19.7, p=0.0002), poorer QoL score related to EOC and treatment (FACT/O-TOI, 72 vs 77, p=0.001), and poorer neurotoxicity FACT/NTx score (35 vs 39, p<0.0001). Especially, 27% of EOCS complained about sensitive neuropathy. Half of EOCS and controls reported anxiety (53% vs 47%, p=0.11); more EOCS noticed depression (22% vs 13%, p=0.01). Active physical activity was noted for 18% of both groups.ConclusionsThis case-control study highlighted that EOCS presented more severe fatigue, with depression, sleep disturbance, poorer long term QoL related to EOC and treatment, associated with neurotoxicity complains. Such late treatments-effects should be considered by clinicians to adapt EOCS management.COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT IN OLDER BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS: A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE LITERATUREA.

Rossi 1 , G. Numico 1 IntroductionLaughter Yoga is a practice codified since 1995 by the Indian doctor Madan Kataria, based on psychological and physiological positive effects of voluntary laughter, supposed to be equivalent to those ones derived from spontaneous laughter. Routine exercises include clapping, eye contact, body movement, breathing exercises, acting and visualization techniques, characterized by children-like playfulness. The final aim is to share consecutive minutes of breaking down inhibitions and laughing without any humorous reason Objectives Test Laughter Yoga as an aid to well-being, in cancer patients under active treatment and in cancer survivors, as well as in caregivers Methods Cancer patients (under adjuvant treatment or under therapy of wellcontrolled metastatic disease), cancer survivors (under regular follow-up check-up program), and their caregivers were invited to join Laughter Yoga bi-monthly meetings of an existing group (initially including nurses, doctors, hospital staff, charity voluntary team).ResultsForty cancer patients and caregivers joined at least two meetings in six months. A satisfaction questionnaire revealed high positive evaluation in 90% and positive evaluation in 7.5%. The median number of people attending the meetings increased from 14 to 28 per meeting, due to diffusion of invitation among cancer patients and their caregivers. Conclusions Preliminary data show high level of acceptance and satisfaction among cancer patients and survivors, and their caregivers. Strongest points of the experience are: well-being time sets shared by patients, caregivers and oncology staff ; easy process of acquiring knowledge of the techniques; emotional bonding.CANCER SURVIVORSHIP NEEDS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE IN CANADA: A KNOWLEDGE TRANSLATION STRATEGY W.

The response rate was 50% with 110 responses while 81 providers completed each field. Results Only 19.05% of PCPs reported receiving a comprehensive summary of cancer treatment from oncologists, while 14.28% received an explicit follow-up care plan documenting recommendations for future care and surveillance. Almost half of PCPs reported having discussions with patients about which provider will follow-up cancer (47.56%) vs. medical issues (39.56%). (Refer to Table1).

Three days later she became hypotensive and hypoxemic, requiring admission to the hospital where initial exam confirmed jaundice and hepatomegaly, and labs showed normocytic anemia (hemoglobin 5.8), thrombocytopenia (platelets 39), elevated LDH (> 7000), indirect hyperbilirubinemia. Blood smear showed anisopoikilocyosis, many spherocytes and schistocytes, teardrop forms, nucleated RBCs, burr cells, bands, metamyelocytes; no blasts and no hypo or hypersegmented neutrophils were seen. These findings were consistent with TMA. She was started on methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg IV every 12 hours and best supportive care. Her hemolytic process was relentless, and she developed severe hypoxemic respiratory failure, unresponsive to mechanical ventilation, succumbing five days after admission. Conclusions TMA is a disorder characterized by microvascular occlusion due to platel e t a g g r e g a t i o n , t h r o m b o c y t o p e n i a a n d o rg a n d a m a g e . Thrombocytopenia, schistocytosis, and elevated levels of LDH are enough to form a diagnosis in clinical practice.

Sadly, this is not the case. There are many considerations to be taken into account, and some key ones are listed below: 1. What question are we trying to answer? 2. Are we studying Radiation versus Systemic treatment, and why? 3. Chemotherapy versus tyrosine kinase inhibitor versus other targeted therapy versus immunotherapy? 4. Which patient population? ' 5. Are we studying a particular cancer or a particular chemotherapy regimen? 6.What are the best regimens and therefore the best cancers? 7. Is the intervention used as prevention or treatment or both? 8.What trial design and which endpoints? 9.Inclusion and exclusion criteria and rationale? And then there is the issue of how to interpret and present the results, and whether they actually answer the question we wanted to answer. It may be worth mocking up some results of the proposed trial and asking whether they have done what you intended. There are many trials in GI mucositis that have failed because these issues haven't been properly thought through. Ways to deal with these problems will be discussed. ",
