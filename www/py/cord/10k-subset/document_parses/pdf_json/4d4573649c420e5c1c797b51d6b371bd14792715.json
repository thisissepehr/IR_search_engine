Fine et al. [20] developed the PSI score. Initially designed for a prognosis evaluation, this score has become a tool for deciding CAP hospitalization. However, several limitations are noteworthy. First, hypoxemia, whose ''weight'' is only 10, remains an important factor of severity, while a 71-year-old man passes immediately to IPS class III only by the ''weight'' of his age. Second, its use in other populations or in countries with different health system needs validation. Finally, socioeconomic condition and psychological and digestive disorders are not taken into account. In our study, the decision for ICU hospitalization was based mainly on the clinical judgment of the physician, taking into account the socioeconomic condition of the patient. Another prognostic score is the CURB-65, widely used and adopted by the British Thoracic Society [21, 25] . This score is much easier to use and Data are presented as number (%) or mean \u00b1 SD or median (extreme) more practical than that of the IPS score. For the ICU admission criteria of patients with CAP, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) recommends admission to intensive care if the patient has two minor signs or one major sign [26] . The ATS criteria seem more practical and easy to use. Indeed, the majority of our patients had at least one criterion of the ATS (acute respiratory failure in 94% of cases, MV in 47% of cases, bilateral radiologic involvement in 39.4%, multilobar involvement in 48.5% of patients, and septic shock in 26.5% of cases). The incidence of mixed CAP varies from 13% to 38% [6, 27] , and S. pneumoniae is the pathogen most often associated with another infectious agent, particularly Haemophilus influenzae [6] , as in our series, but also with atypical bacterial pathogens and viruses [28] . This large variation is the result of the variation of microbiological tests carried out in various studies. In our work, the search for atypical pathogens is very inadequate, and no respiratory viruses have been searched.

First, this is a retrospective cohort study, and there are inherent problems related to this design, including selection bias. However, several similar studies, including epidemiological studies, have provided relevant data to the medical scientific community. Second, the study period is very wide (January 1999-August 2008). However, during this period the epidemiology of bacterial CAP and the acquisition of antibiotic resistance have evolved and changed over time. Our diagnostic and therapeutic strategy may also have changed in this long period. Third, the antimicrobial susceptibility testing used the E test method and not the broth microdilution test, which is now considered the gold standard method. The MIC was not performed for all antimicrobial against S. pneumoniae isolates. Also, the MIC 50 and MIC 90 were not performed for any antimicrobial. Investigation to detect atypical pathogens was insufficient. All these limits are mainly the result of the lack of resources in a developing country such as ours. Finally, this is a single-center study.
