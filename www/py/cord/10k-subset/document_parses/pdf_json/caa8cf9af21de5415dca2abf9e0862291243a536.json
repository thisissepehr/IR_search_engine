Although cardiac arrhythmias often accompany NMDARE, they are rarely detailed in literature. We seek to describe the course of a previously healthy female who was positive for Anti-NMDAR antibodies but was negative for primary tumor. Her course was complicated by intermittent bradyarrhythmias which progressed at times to asystole, and ultimately warranted permanent pacemaker implantation. Our patient was a 31-year-old African American female with no significant past medical history. She initially presented to the psychiatric portion of our hospital with new onset psychosis. She was transferred to our neurologic intensive care unit after a seizure and persistent altered mental status likely secondary to catatonia. The severity of her catatonia and the frequency of her seizures contributed to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Her course was then further complicated by hemodynamically significant bradycardia induced by vasovagal maneuvers. The episodes were initially self-limited, with spontaneous return to hemodynamic stability. However, they eventually necessitated pharmacologic intervention for resolution. Initial therapy was thus targeted at preventing vasovagal episodes, such as intravenous fentanyl and endotracheal lidocaine for cough suppression. As her disease progressed, the hemodynamically significant bradycardia began to occur independently of vagal stimuli. It also became refractory to pharmacologic intervention. Cessation only occurred by chest compressions or transcutaneous pacing, thus warranting implantation of a permanent pacemaker.",

TBI is the leading cause of death in children, and boys and younger children have poor outcomes compared to girls and older children. CPP is often normalized by use of inotropes and vasopressors to increase MAP and optimize CBF. Since ethical considerations constrain mechanistic studies in children, we use an established porcine model of fluid percussion brain injury (FPI). Phenylephrine (Phe) prevented in female but exacerbated impairment of autoregulation in male piglets after FPI. In contrast, dopamine (DA) prevented impairment of autoregulation in both sexes after FPI, suggesting that pressor choice impacts outcome. Activation of Katp and Kca channels is an important mechanism for vasodilation, including autoregulation. K channel mediated dilation is blunted after FPI via upregulation of ERK mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK). Phe protected impairment of K channel mediated dilation in females but aggravated impairment in male piglets after FPI.

This poorly understood manifestation seems different from well-described sudden cardiac arrest in supratentorial lesions, which usually present as ventricular tachycardia/ ventricular fibrillation followed by asystole and circulatory collapse. In this case, we speculate that brainstem ischemia influencing cardiac and respiratory centers created autonomic dysregulation and vagal overtone in the setting of vagal stimulation from NGT placement led to severe parasympathetic overflow (storm) and culminated in severe bradycardia and asystolic cardiac arrest. In conclusion, rare, yet fatal arrhythmias occur in acute brainstem ischemia, and particularly in lateral medullary syndrome and may be potentially avoidable.

Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) was elevated to 350 uIU/ml. Patient was intubated and aggressively managed in critical care unit with intravenous (IV) levothyroxine, hydrocortisone and antibiotics. The following day, eyelid twitching, followed by clonic convulsions of the extremities occurred and was successfully aborted with lorazepam. Levetiracetam was initiated. EEG showed semirhythmic generalized slowing with embedded sharp waves, most prominent in bilateral posterior head regions, consistent with NCSE. These electrographical seizures were successfully terminated using a lorazepam challenge test with re-emergence of voluntary withdrawal to painful stimulation. Despite aggressive treatment with IV levothyroxine and antiepileptis under continuous video-EEG monitoring and achieving full control of her NCSE, she developed multi-organ failure which eventually led to her death.",

Lumbar puncture was consistent with bacterial infection. Blood and CSF cultures revealed Streptococcus pneumoniae. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated and laboratory improvement was noted. Repeat physical examination upon extubation two days later revealed left-sided 3rd nerve palsy and hemiplegia. MRI brain revealed small scattered foci of restricted diffusion consistent with infarcts, but did not explain the left-sided findings. CT angiogram showed complete occlusion of the vertebral artery from an adjacent compressive hypodense collection. MRI spine showed osteomyelitis/diskitis in multiple vertebrae and diffuse prevertebral and epidural enhancing fluid collections representing abscesses causing cervical cord compression.

Busy units are often under staffed and the physicians have to ration their time to each patient based on need. When there are conflicting needs it may be a difficult choice as to which patient gets that necessary level of attention. This conundrum is most evident with the organ donor population. When a physician has a \"crashing\" patient that is likely to survive and one that is not, resources are typically shunted to the survivable patient. Neurocritical care physicians and engineers at the University of Wisconsin developed the Digital Intern to tackle this problem head-on.

However, standard therapies for SIADH such as fluid restriction are often impractical, counterindicated or impossible in neurocritical patients (e.g. patients with SAH). Thus many patients are treated with hypertonic saline, which is usually effective but at the price of inducing hypervolemia with possible (worsening of) cardiac dysfunction, and will often require central venous access and ICU monitoring.

It was first identified in 1994 in the Kyushu district of Japan and only recently has it been described in more detail. It is characterized by a clinical presentation similar to HSV encephalitis with MRI imaging findings often showing bilateral hippocampal and amygdala hyperintensities. Detailed work-up however including HSV PCR, ELISA, and post-mortem analysis in select cases have been negative for herpes simplex encephalitis. Its clinic course is notable for altered behavior, fever, and prolonged seizures with cognitive deficits being a common sequelae. It generally carries a favorable prognosis, however, and is therefore important to recognize. A correlation has been found between NHALE and autoantibodies against glutamate receptor epsilon2 and delta2. (GluR-epsilon2 and GluR-delta2). Here we present a consolidated case series of 24 patients gathered from previously listed case reports in Japan including 4 patients of our own as well as review the implications of this important entity.",
