Prior to the pandemic, many countries stockpiled NAIs and developed pandemic plans for the use of antiviral drugs, based on either treatment of high-risk individuals and/or prophylaxis of contacts. However, to date there has been a lack of in vivo models to test the efficacy of treatment or prophylaxis with NAIs, for influenza-infected individuals or exposed contacts, in a household setting.",

            "text": "The prophylactic and/or therapeutic management of seasonal influenza currently relies solely on the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (NAIs) due to resistance of circulating influenza A viruses to the older adamantane class of antivirals. 1, 2 The most widely prescribed NAI is oseltamivir (Tamiflu TM ), followed by zanamivir (Relenza TM ), although other new NAIs, such as laninamivir and peramivir, have recently been approved for use in Japan, South Korea and China. 3, 4 Many countries have stockpiled antiviral drugs, particularly oseltamivir, in preparedness for a future influenza pandemic. For seasonal influenza, pre-exposure prophylaxis with NAIs has been shown to be effective in preventing the development of symptomatic infection in household contacts. 5, 6 Likewise, post-exposure prophylaxis with NAIs has also been effective in reducing the spread of infection in household contacts and communities. 7, 8 The emergence of the pandemic A(H1N1) pdm09 influenza virus in March -April 2009 resulted in a significant increase in the global use of NAIs for the treatment and prevention of infection. 9 Early NAI treatment of infected individuals or patients displaying influenza-like symptoms was associated with reductions in both severe clinical outcomes and mortality during the 2009 pandemic. 10 In addition, post-exposure oseltamivir prophylaxis was effective in reducing the rate of A(H1N1)pdm09 viral infections in households 11 and closed institutional settings such as military camps. 12 However, the therapeutic and prophylactic effectiveness of oseltamivir against mild seasonal influenza infections has been questioned following a meta-analysis of clinical trial data. 13 Prior to the 2009 pandemic, countries proposed different strategies for the use of antivirals. Australia's pandemic plan recommended liberal antiviral distribution for prophylaxis to limit the spread of infection and buy time for vaccine development, 14 but other countries, such as the USA, focused on the use of NAIs for case treatment. 15 The development of guidelines on the appropriate use of NAIs relies on antiviral effectiveness data derived largely from field epidemiological studies or clinical studies. However, these data may be limited or not available for newly emerged strains, which could differ in virulence and transmissibility from seasonal influenza viruses. Animal studies of NAI effectiveness, which have the advantage of being more rapidly established than human studies, have the potential to provide early data on the effectiveness of an NAI against a newly emerged influenza virus. Consequently, an in vivo model to test the effectiveness of different antiviral treatment or prophylaxis regimens on influenza infection and transmission in a household setting is needed.",

The time for all contact ferrets to become infected was significantly delayed in the prophylaxis group dosed twice daily compared with the oncedaily prophylaxis and no intervention groups (twice-daily prophylaxis, day 10; once-daily prophylaxis, day 7; no intervention, day 6; P \u00bc 0.043; Figure 2a ). Virus shedding profiles of the single index ferrets from each of the three groups were similar and therefore are unlikely to have biased the infection of contact ferrets in the different groups within this experiment ( Figure S2A , available as Supplementary data at JAC Online). Although twice-daily oseltamivir prophylaxis delayed the infection of contact ferrets, it did not prevent all the contact ferrets becoming infected (Figure 2a) . However, percentage weight loss following infection among the twice-daily oseltamivir prophylaxis group was significantly less than in ferrets receiving either once-daily oseltamivir prophylaxis or no intervention during days 1-4 post-exposure (Figure 2b ). No significant differences in body temperature were observed between the three groups of contact ferrets (Figure 2c ). Ferrets from oncedaily and twice-daily oseltamivir prophylaxis groups were significantly more active than untreated ferrets on days 4, 5 and 9 and days 4, 7, 8 and 9, respectively ( Figure 2d ). Despite these differences, the contact ferrets in all three groups had similar HI antibody titres and viral shedding patterns, with no significant difference in either peak viral titres or duration of shedding (Figure 2e and f and Table 1) . Collectively, the data show that pre-exposure prophylaxis with two doses of oseltamivir daily was effective in delaying infection of all contact ferrets and improving clinical symptoms (reduced weight loss and a higher activity score), whereas prophylaxis using only one dose of oseltamivir daily appeared only to improve ferret activity compared with no intervention (Table 2 ).",

However, at the time when the index ferrets were co-housed with contacts in this post-exposure prophylaxis experiment, the viral titres of these index ferrets (4 -5.5 log 10 TCID 50 / mL) were considerably greater than that of the index ferrets in the pre-exposure prophylaxis experiment (0 -1.75 log 10 TCID 50 / mL) ( Figure S2A and B) . As a result, it took only 2 days for all untreated control ferrets in the post-exposure prophylaxis experiment to become infected, compared with 6 days in the pre-exposure prophylaxis experiment (Figures 2a and 3a) . When comparing within the 24 h post-exposure prophylaxis experiment, neither dosing regimen (once-and twice-daily oseltamivir) delayed the time of infection compared with untreated control ferrets, with all becoming infected within 2 days of exposure (Figure 3a) . While the twice-daily post-exposure prophylaxis group did show significantly less weight loss from day 4 to day 7 compared with the control group, no significant effect on weight loss was seen in the once-daily post-exposure prophylaxis group (Figure 3b ). In addition, the twice-daily post-exposure prophylaxis group also Evaluating oseltamivir regimens in a ferret model 2461 JAC showed significantly less weight loss from day 3 to day 9 compared with the once-daily post-exposure prophylaxis group (Figure 3b) . Neither of the post-exposure prophylaxis regimens (once-and twice-daily oseltamivir) had an effect on body temperature (Figure 3c ). However, compared with the untreated ferrets, those that received either once-or twice-daily oseltamivir in the postexposure prophylaxis groups were significantly more active across much of the 10 day period (Figure 3d) . Importantly, both postexposure prophylaxis regimens (once-and twice-daily oseltamivir) did not alter viral shedding profiles or HI antibody titres (Figure 3e and f and Table 1 ). Collectively, the data show that oseltamivir administered either once or twice daily 24 h post-exposure improved the activity of contact ferrets and reduced weight loss (for twice-daily dosing only), but had no significant effect on infection, temperature, viral shedding kinetics or HI antibody response ( Table 2) .",

The mean concentration of oseltamivir required to inhibit NA activity by 50% (IC 50 ) (+ SD) for all virus isolates was 0.3+0.2 nM, with none displaying either reduced (IC 50 .10-fold above the mean) or highly reduced (IC 50 .100-fold above the mean) inhibition. However, because the NA inhibition assay is unable to detect low proportions of resistant virus in a mixed viral population, RNA from all nasal washes was tested in a pyrosequencing assay for the detection of the H275Y NA mutation, known to confer resistance to oseltamivir in A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. A sample from one of the oseltamivir-treated index ferrets on day 5 postinfection contained a mixed population of resistant and susceptible viruses, with 17% of viruses containing the H275Y NA mutation and 83% the susceptible wild-type virus.

Twice-daily oseltamivir prophylaxis at 12 h post-exposure was effective in delaying infection and improving clinical symptoms, but delaying prophylaxis until 24 h post-exposure resulted in the loss of most of these benefits. However, even at 24 h post-exposure, both dosing regimens (once-and twice-daily) appeared to improve ferret activity significantly compared with untreated control ferrets. Treatment for human influenza is recommended within 48 h of symptom onset, with delays resulting in reduced effectiveness in the treated patient. 28 However, little is known about how the timing of index treatment may alter the transmission of influenza to exposed contacts. In our study, we treated index ferrets at 36 h post-infection, which was estimated to be 12 -24 h after symptom onset, but this intervention had little or no effect on the infection of contact ferrets. This demonstrated that, in our model, prophylaxis of contacts was necessary to alter normal transmission. Numerous human studies have shown that antiviral prophylaxis has high protective efficacy against influenza infections. 5, 7, 8, 29, 30 In a proof-of-concept study involving 33 subjects, prophylaxis with 100 mg of oseltamivir once or twice daily for 5 days, starting 26 h prior to intranasal challenge with A/Texas/ 36/91 (H1N1), significantly reduced infection rates and inhibited viral shedding compared with placebo. 29 A follow-up multicentre clinical study by Hayden et al. 5 demonstrated a similar protective effect of pre-exposure prophylaxis against seasonal influenza infections in healthy, non-immunized subjects who received either once-daily (75 mg/kg) or twice-daily (150 mg/kg) prophylaxis with oseltamivir. Likewise, post-exposure prophylaxis of contacts in a randomized controlled trial also showed high protective efficacy in individuals and contacts. 7, 8 Compared with the benefits of pre-or post-exposure oseltamivir prophylaxis observed in the human studies, the effects of oseltamivir intervention described in our ferret model were more modest. This could be a result of study limitations, such as the differences in viral titres of donor ferrets between pre-and postexposure prophylaxis experiments, which could have biased the speed at which contact ferrets became infected. Other limitations of the study include the use of only a twice-daily, and not also once-daily, oseltamivir dosing regimen in the 12 h post-exposure prophylaxis experiment. In addition, the prolonged co-housing of index and contact ferrets in very close proximity meant that the duration and magnitude of virus exposure experienced by contact ferrets were likely to be considerably higher than those in a typical human household context. In addition, as contacts became infected, they became additional index ferrets, thereby increasing the probability of infecting further contact animals. Both factors, together with the observation that ferrets can transmit A(H1N1)pdm09 virus during both the early and late periods of infection, 31 may explain why none of the oseltamivir interventions was able to prevent infection.",

Separation of human index cases from exposed contacts receiving prophylaxis has been shown in a military setting to dramatically reduce the rate of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. 12 Additionally, ferrets with pre-existing immunity to a distantly related influenza virus rather than influenza-naive ferrets, as used in our study, may better represent a typical human adult who has been previously infected or vaccinated with influenza. Finally, while the treatment dose of 5 mg/kg twice daily with oseltamivir in ferrets has been widely accepted as the equivalent dose to that used in the treatment of human influenza infections (75 mg/kg twice daily) 4,32 and is widely used in many ferret studies, 20, 22, 33, 34 further detailed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies in ferrets are needed to allow a robust comparison with equivalent human data. 35, 36 Although pre-or post-exposure oseltamivir prophylaxis of contact ferrets was unable to prevent A(H1N1)pdm09 infection or significantly reduce viral shedding, it did appear to reduce weight loss and improve activity, a similar finding to that reported by Govorkova et al. 37 for the treatment of index ferrets at 2 or 24 h post-infection. The reason for the improved clinical signs in the absence of clear virological improvement remains unclear, although a recent report by Maines et al. 38 on the effect of local innate immune responses to virus infection may provide an explanation. Among parameters not measured in our study are the levels of proinflammatory mediators in the respiratory tract, including IFNa/b, TNFa, IL-6, IL-12, CXCL9 and CXCL11, which have been shown to correlate with viral transmission, clinical signs of infections and influenza virus shedding in the ferret model. 38 In mice, the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 has also been demonstrated to play an important role in governing antiviral immunity by limiting inflammation and promoting antiviral T cell responses to lung injury. 39 In humans infected with A/Texas/36/91 (H1N1), oseltamivir treatment was associated with significantly lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IFNg, TNFa and IL-6, in nasal lavage fluid. 29 Therefore, oseltamivir prophylaxis in the ferrets may result in downregulation of various proinflammatory mediators, resulting in alleviation of clinical symptoms.",

We showed that, under most of the prophylaxis regimens, the administration of oseltamivir significantly improved activity, but had little or no effect on viral shedding. In many human oseltamivir clinical trials, swabs have been taken only from symptomatic patients 29, 40, 41 as opposed to our ferret model, where all ferrets were swabbed daily regardless of symptoms. However, studies have shown that, following oseltamivir treatment, asymptomatic patients do shed influenza virus. 8, 11 This suggests that our finding that ferrets displayed improved activity while still shedding high titres of virus may extend to the human situation. 8, 11 From a public health perspective, it would be concerning if patients who received oseltamivir prophylaxis or treatment were returning to normal social activities prematurely due to experiencing mild or no symptoms while still shedding virus. These findings caution against over-reliance on pharmaceutical measures to reduce influenza transmission, and reinforce the importance of developing robust evidence-based guidelines for adjunct personal hygiene and social distancing measures to limit the spread of disease.",
