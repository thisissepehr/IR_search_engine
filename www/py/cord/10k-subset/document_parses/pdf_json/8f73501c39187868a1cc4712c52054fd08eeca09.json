This carcinogenic effect of DNT, however, was not predicted by in vitro tests for genotoxicity. In the Ames Salmonella assay tgDNT and the individual DNT isomers have been reported as showing no mutagenicity (2, 3) or, at best, producing a weak response with specific isomers (4) . No increase in mutagenicity was observed in the Chinese hamster ovary cell/hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase mutagenesis assay with tgDNT or its purified isomers with or without metabolic activation (5) . Neither 2,4-DNT nor 3,5-DNT produced an increase in mitotic recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae D3 (3).",

The lack of a response in the latter test is of particular significance because hepatocytes represent the target cells of the carcinogen in vivo. This finding is not surprising, however, in that the in vitro DNA repair assay has been shown to be unresponsive to nitroaromatic carcinogens (10) . Several in vivo assays also failed to show any activity with 2,4-DNT (7, 8) , but these systems did not measure responses in the appropriate target tissue. The dose-related effect (Figure 2 ) of tgDNT in the in vivo-in vitro hepatocyte UDS system and the strong response of 2,6-DNT (Table II) indicate that these chemicals are indeed potent genotoxic agents in rat hepatocytes when administered in vivo, and suggests that this system may be of value in predicting potential carcinogenic activity of nitroaromatic compounds.",

In contrast, no UDS was induced by tgDNT at this time ( Figure 1) ; instead, UDS induced by tgDNT peaks at 12 h after treatment. This delay in the peak of UDS probably reflects the complexity of DNT disposition. Both the liver (11) and cecal flora (12) are capable of metabolizing DNT. The excretion of reduced metabolites of 2,4-DNT is greatly diminished in germ-free rats (13) . This complex pattern of metabolism is the most probable reason that activity is seen in vivo and not in vitro. Experiments with axenic animals using the in vivo-in vitro DNA repair assay have proven that metabolism by cecal bacteria is an obligatory step leading to the genotoxic activity of tgDNT (14) .",

One obvious difference in these results is that the dose of 2,6-DNT was far greater in the CUT study compared to the other two studies which employed semi-purified 2,4-DNT. The greater tumor induction in the CUT study is consistent with what would be predicted from our in vivo UDS results. In addition, 2,6-DNT was the only DNT isomer that could initiate 7-glutamyl transpeptidase positive foci in the liver (20) . Although many factors contribute to the outcome of long-term carcinogenicity bioassays, taken together these studies suggest that the major portion of the initiating activity of tgDNT resides with the 2,6-isomer.",

Indeed, the number of replicating cells fell in subsequent weeks, declining to the expected value of <0.1% by week 4. The steady increase over time in the percentage of cells in S-phase from tgDNT-fed animals is further evidence of the ability of DNT to stimulate DNA replication.
