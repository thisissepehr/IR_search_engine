            "text": "Three sets of blood samples were obtained from beef calves of two experimental populations and assayed for various immunological measurements. The first set of samples was taken between 24 and 48 h after birth and quantified for IgG~ concentration. A second set was taken immediately prior to vaccination for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV; at an average age of 164 d) and a third set taken 60 d post-vaccination. These later samples were quantified for antibodies specific to 1BRV. Level of complement C3 was also quantified in the samples taken immediately prior to vaccination. Three hundred sixty-seven calves were from four Hereford lines; three lines were previously selected for growth traits and the fourth was a randomly selected control line. There were no consistent differences in immune traits among these lines. The second group of 165 animals were Angus, Hereford and Red Poll calves. While Angus calves had a higher mean IgG t concentration at 24 to 48 h of age than Hereford or Red Poll calves, no differences among breeds were found for the other immune traits measured. Calves from older dams (>3 yr old) tended to have higher mean lgGa concentrations, pre-vaccination IBRV antibody titers and complement C3 levels than calves from 2-and 3-yr-old cows. However, these calves had lower 60-d post-vaccination IBRV titers than calves from the younger cows (P<.05). As pre-vaccination I.BRV antibody titer increased, post-vaccination IBRV antibody titer decreased (P<.05). All pooled heritability estimates did not differ significantly from 0 (range -.06 + .08 to .21 +-.12), nor were there significant phenotypic associations between the immune traits and growth performance.

Estimates of heritability for neonatal immunoglobulin levels in cattle (Norman et al., 1981) and sheep (Berggren-Thomas, 1985; Gilbert et al., 1986) ance may decrease livestock losses due to disease. Studies in cattle (Lie, 1979) , sheep (Nguyen, 1984; Berggren-Thomas, 1985) and swine (Buschmann et al., 1974; Rothschild et al., 1984a,b) have investigated genetic variation for immune response against an antigen. In these studies, heritability estimates ranged from .05 + .20 to .70 + .13. This study was designed to examine genetic variation among and within genetic groups for: serum IgG 1 concentration at 24 to 48 h of age, IBRV (infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus) antibody titers immediately prior to IBRV vaccination as well as 60 d post-vaccination, and complement C3 level immediately prior to vaccination. Some potential environmental sources of variation affecting these immune traits (e.g., sex of calf, age of calf and of dam, inbreeding of calf and of dam and birth weight) also were examined, and phenotypic associations among immune traits and between immune traits and growth were studied.",

In additional analyses of serum IgG1 concentration, linear and curvilinear effects of birth weight were analyzed within line or breed as potential sources of variation. In the analyses for IBRV titers prior to vaccination and 60 d post-vaccination and complement C3 level, factors included as potential sources of vari-ation were linear and curvilinear effects of birth weight within line or breed, serum IgG1 concentration within line or breed and age of calf. Linear, quadratic and cubic effects of inbreeding of dam and calf on all immune traits were analzyed as covariates in the Selection Experiment Hereford population. All regression polynomials were sequentially tested and eliminated if not significant. The final mathematical model for each immune trait within each population included line or breed of calf, sire within line or breed, sex, age of dam and terms through the highest order of polynomial that was significant for each covariate. All effects were assumed fixed except sire within line or breed. The mean square for sire within line or breed was the error term for line or breed, respectively. The residual mean square was used for testing all other sources of variation. Mean squares from analyses of the final model for each immune trait within each population were used to compute sire and residual variance components for deriving paternal half-sib heritability estimates for each population. To determine pooled heritability estimates (across populations), pooled sire and residual mean squares for each immune trait were obtained by adding the respective degrees of freedom and sums of squares from the separate analyses of the two populations.

Several observations support the interpretation that maternal antibodies probably were present at vaccination.

Both IgG 1 and IBRV antibodies are components of colostral immunoglobulins, the former being antibodies of a specific subclass and the latter being antibodies to a specific antigen (IBRV). It may be that calves obtaining high levels of colostral IgG 1 acquired high colostral titers specific to IBRV as well.

Calves from older cows had higher titers of pre-vaccination IBRV antibodies than calves from younger cows. It is possible that more colostral antibodies were present immediately prior to vaccination in calves from older cows because higher titers of IBRV antibodies, as well as higher levels of IgGl, were available to them at birth. The age of dam effect also was significant for post-vaccination IBRV antibody titer, with calves from older cows having lower titers than calves from younger cows. If calves from older cows, those with higher titers of residual pre-vaccination IBRV antibodies, had greater neutralization of the vaccine, a lower vaccination response would occur and lower titers 60 d later would result.",

If calves had lost these IBRV colostral antibodies at the rate of one-half their remaining antibody titers every 82 d, the pre-vaccination titers found in this study (4.8 + .15 and 4.6 -+ .40, respectively) would have been expected. However, if the half-life of these proteins was that long, the antibodies must be extremely resistant to proteolytic decay. In the study by Brar et al. (1978) , a half-life of 21 d was estimated for IBRV-specific antibodies in calves known to be free from natural infection of IBRV. If 21 d were the half-life for antibodies in calves of this study, colostral antibodies would be at a very low level by 84 d of age, and responses to IBRV infections would have begun. Multiple exposures to IBRV can be expected in cattle herds as large as the Selection Experiment Hereford and GPU populations. Thus, the antibodies existing immediately prior to vaccination may have been produced in response to natural infection. Yet regardless of the origin of IBRV antibodies present immediately prior to vaccination, they appear to have inhibited vaccination response.",

Measurement 28 d post-vaccination might be more suitable because peak level of antibodies against IBRV antigen occurs around 28 d post-vaccination (Gerber et al., 1978) . In this study, persistence of antibodies may have been measured rather than peak response. Biozzi et al. (1979) successfully selected mice for increased antibody titer against sheep and pigeon red blood cells given in alternating generations. Yet these same mice were less efficient at catabolizing the antigen within phagocytic cells called macrophages, and the antigen was more persistent within the body. These mice were more susceptible to classes of pathogens for which immunological defense is primarily by phagocytic means. There is an important lesson from the finding of Biozzi et al. (1979) : before sound recommendations can be made concerning selection for improved disease resistance, associations among immune traits must be known. The results of this experiment suggest the existence of intricate associations among the antibody-mediated immune traits measured.
