The independent predictors of influenza A virus were identified on the basis of demographic features and the clinical symptoms of the patients who tested positive for influenza A virus in the RIDT test. Of the 1,122 cases tested, 389 (34.7%) were positive for the influenza A virus. The median age of the influenza-positive patients was 14, and 58.9% of the patients were male. The symptoms fever, cough, rhinorrhea, and headache were statistically dominant. A history of recent contact with persons suffering from influenza or influenzalike illness at home, school, or in the workplace was significantly more common in the positive group than in the negative group. Pneumonia was observed in 2 (0.5%) of the positive patients, but the symptoms were only severe enough to require hospitalization in 1 of the 2. No deaths were observed among the 389 RIDT-positive patients. Although the spread of influenza A virus was both rapid and extensive, mainly among children under the age of 18, it seemed to be mild.

Most of the affected patients have been young. During our investigation period, more than 70% of the RIDT-positive outpatients were under the age of 18 years, and only 3.1% were 51 years of age or older. Influenza morbidity was much more common in the young than in the old in our investigation. This was identical to the trend observed for the morbidity of seasonal influenza. One reason proposed for this young age distribution has been the higher risk of Fisher's exact test c Influenza-like illness is defined as self-reported fever with cough, sore throat, or both influenza exposure in school environments. Although seasonal influenza-associated hospitalization rates and mortality are higher among persons 65 years of age or older and young children than among healthy older children and younger adults [8, 9] , none of the patients in our series, including the older adults, deteriorated to serious conditions. Chowell et al. [4] reported that low rates of morbidity and mortality from the pandemic influenza among the elderly reflect relatively stronger protection for persons who had been exposed to H1N1 strains during childhood, before the 1957 pandemic. There is reported evidence that exposure to a 1918-like H1N1 virus contributed to the induction of a cross-reactive antibody response to the pandemic influenza virus [10] . Similarly, both studies in England and in Japan have revealed that serum donors from older adults who had probably been exposed to the 1918 virus or a closely related H1N1 virus carried high levels of neutralizing antibodies against the 2009 H1N1 [11, 12] . The most common symptoms in our patients were fever, cough, and rhinorrhea. However, somewhat fewer patients in our series presented with gastrointestinal disturbances including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, compared with the patients reported in the United States [13] and Mexico [5] . These previous reports included a number of hospitalized patients who deteriorated into severe conditions as a result of the difficulty in rapid identification of the novel pandemic influenza and delays in the initiation of antiviral drugs during the early phase of the epidemic. Therefore, differences in seasonal effects, the length of time from onset to treatment, and the severity of the illness might have affected the incidence of gastrointestinal disturbances.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 48, "end": 51, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 52, "end": 54, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 75, "end": 78, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 95, "end": 98, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1035, "end": 1038, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1039, "end": 1041, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1159, "end": 1162, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1558, "end": 1562, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1812, "end": 1816, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1817, "end": 1820, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2090, "end": 2094, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2106, "end": 2109, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Positive findings in the RIDT were significantly more frequent in our male patients than in our female patients.

Without this diagnostic confirmation, we were unable to determine whether there were any cases with influenza A subtypes other than pandemic influenza. However, the Japanese IDSC reports that the proportion of pandemic influenza to all influenza virus was 99% during our investigation period [3] . Only a very small number of positive patients were thought to suffer from seasonal influenza virus. Second, the sensitivity of the RIDTs is still poor [16] [17] [18] . According to the report and to guidance from the CDC, the specificity of RIDTs is generally high [16, 17] . When influenza viruses are circulating in a community, a positive test indicates that the specimen is likely to be infected with the influenza virus.
