Among different treatments proposed, exogenous surfactant showed conflicting results. Aim of this multicenter retrospective observational study was to evaluate whether poractant alfa use in pediatric ARDS might improve gas exchange in children less than 2 years old, according to a shared protocol. Methods: The study was carried out in fourteen Italian PICUs after dissemination of a standardized protocol for surfactant administration within the Italian PICU network. The protocol provides the administration of surfactant (50 mg/kg) divided in two doses: the first dose is used as a bronchoalveolar lavage while the second as supplementation. Blood gas exchange variations before and after surfactant use were recorded. Results: Sixty-nine children, age 0-24 months, affected by Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome treated with exogenous porcine surfactant were enrolled. Data collection consisted of patient demographics, respiratory variables and arterial blood gas analysis. The most frequent reasons for PICU admission were acute respiratory failure, mainly bronchiolitis and pneumonia, and septic shock. Fifty-four children (78.3%) had severe ARDS (define by oxygen arterial pressure and inspired oxygen fraction ratio (P/F) < 100), 15 (21.7%) had moderate ARDS (100 < P/ F < 200). PO 2 , P/F, Oxygenation Index (OI) and pH showed a significant improvement after surfactant use with respect to baseline (p < 0.001 at each included time-point for each parameter). No significant difference in blood gas variations were observed among four different subgroups of diseases (bronchiolitis, pneumonia, septic shock and others). Overall, 11 children died (15.9%) and among these, 10 (90.9%) had complex chronic conditions. Two children (18.2%) died while being treated with Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). Mortality for severe pARDS was 20.4%. Conclusion: The use of porcine Surfactant improves oxygenation, P/F ratio, OI and pH in a population of children with moderate or severe pARDS caused by multiple diseases. A shared protocol seems to be a good option to obtain the same criteria of enrollment among different PICUs and define a unique way of use and administration of the drug for future studies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) represents a severe form of respiratory failure both for adults and children, with a lower prevalence (range 2.0-12.8%) and mortality (range 18-27%) in pediatric than in adult patients (range 17.9-81% and range 27-45% respectively) [1] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 275, "end": 278, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Many treatments have been used in pediatric ARDS (pARDS) with no clear preferred therapy [2] .

Surfactant is probably the therapy with the highest level of expectations, but still few convincing data support its use for pARDS.

The difficulty to perform a RCT in pediatrics is high and the reasons are well known [24] .

Beside surfactant use (timing, dose, administration mode), the protocol should strictly define and describe how to manage ventilation, nutrition, fluid and transfusion management in order to reduce possible confounding behavior. The second limitation is that we did not record consistently pulmonary mechanics variables such as compliance and resistance. These measures might better define changes in treated patients and help to identify responder and non-responders. Moreover, not all the children with ARDS during the study years were enrolled in the study. Through the Italian registry of PICU admission (TIPNet) we estimated that 10-30% of children who developed pARDS in any form of severity did not receive surfactant. Unfortunately, we cannot stratify for severity (mild, moderate, severe) as this information is not available in the registry for all the patients. However, we asked the centers to describe the local habit and in most of them surfactant is used only for severe pARDS forms.
