CMV viremia was quite uncommon in immunocompetent patients when compared to immunocompromised patients. The mortality rate at 6 months was higher in immunocompetent patients; however, this may be attributable to the significantly older age of immunocompetent patients, and the fact that they had more severe underlying disease. Like other herpes viruses, CMV causes a primary infection that is followed by a latent infection. Viral DNA has been detected in monocytes, dendritic cells, megakaryocytes, and myeloid progenitor cells in bone marrow [32] . Reactivation causing tissue-invasive diseases usually occur in immunocompromised patients, including those with AIDS, organ transplantation, and those receiving immunosuppressive agents.

In our study and in other cohorts, the majority of immunocompetent patients presented with gastrointestinal bleeding [7, 16, 27, 28] , while diarrhea was the most common presentation in immunocompromised patients [7] . It is known that CMV can infect vascular endothelium resulting in ischemic damage to the mucosa that causes bleeding [36] . In immunocompetent patients, the ischemic process may be potentiated by hypoperfusion state caused by underlying conditions, and this may cause more bleeding. The endoscopic finding of the \"single-stripe sign\", which is normally observed in patients with ischemic colitis, was found in some GI-CMV patients and supports this hypothesis (Fig. 1b) . Concomitant CMV infection in other organs is extremely rare. Neither our study nor any of the other previous case series found any cases of concomitant CMV infection in other organs [7, 14, 16, 27, 28] . In contrast, concomitant CMV infection in other organs was reported in 7% of immunocompromised patients. This suggests a hypothesis that CMV reactivation in immunocompetent host is a local reactivation rather than a systemic reactivation. This hypothesis could be supported by the results of blood tests for viremia since as high as 40-75% of patients had negative test for viremia, either by Ag detection or by CMV viral load [7, 27, 28] . The role of specific antiviral treatment for immunocompetent patients is still being debated. A 2005 systematic review showed that spontaneous resolution occurred mainly in patients < 55 years of age that had no other comorbidities [31] . Treatment with antiviral agents was reported to have no effect on mortality rate [7] . However, interestingly, and in contrasttreatment with antiviral agents was identified as the only significant protective factor against death in our study.
