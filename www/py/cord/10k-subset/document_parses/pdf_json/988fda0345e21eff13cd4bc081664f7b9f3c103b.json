One of them is the architecture of their genomic folds, which must not only feature precise structural elements at specific positions, but also allow for overall spatial compactness. The latter was shown to be disrupted by random synonymous mutations, a disruption which can consequently negatively affect genome encapsidation. In this study, we use three mutation schemes with different degrees of locality to mutate the genomes of phage MS2 and Brome Mosaic virus in order to understand the observed sensitivity of the global compactness of their folds. We find that mutating local stretches of their genomes' sequence or structure is less disruptive to their compactness compared to inducing randomly-distributed mutations. Our findings are indicative of a mechanism for the conservation of compactness acting on a global scale of the genomes, and have several implications for understanding the interplay between local and global architecture of viral RNA genomes.",

The very different flexural rigidities of single-and double-stranded nucleic acids call for different mechanisms of genome packaging inside viral capsids. Double-stranded DNA, which has a persistence length of \u223c50 nm, is inserted into a pre-formed capsid by a molecular motor, and the mature virion has to withstand a significant positive osmotic pressure as a result [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . On the other hand, single-stranded (ss)RNA has a persistence length of only about 1 nm, and its self-interaction and interactions with the capsid proteins are sufficient to drive its organization into a rather compact fold, inducing a small negative osmotic pressure [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Indeed, the sizes of wild-type (WT) ssRNA genomes of icosahedral viruses are usually only slightly larger than the space available inside the proteinaceous capsid of the mature virions [11] . This implies that only a modest additional compression of the ssRNA has to be imparted by the viral coat proteins that attach and assemble around the genome to form the capsid [6, [12] [13] [14] [15] .",

A follow-up study by Tubiana et al [16] further established that even relatively mild alterations of the WT sequence in the form of synonymous mutations can be as disruptive for the overall compactness of the genome folds as complete random reshufflings. These results indicate that, just as for specific local RNA structures [17] [18] [19] [20] and phenotypic viral proteins, the global compactness of viral ssRNA genomes too has been optimised by evolutionary mechanisms [21] . In addition, both experimental and bioinformatics studies have indicated that a key recurrent and distinctive element of compact RNA folds is the presence of hubs with high-degree branching points in their secondary structure [22, 23] . These hubs are instrumental for the organization of the RNA fold into a floret-like structure composed of several local structural moduli ( 1000 nt long) [24, 25] and for the general control of the fold compactness [22] .",

While it has already been shown that a sufficient amount of random synonymous mutations disrupts the compactness of the folds, it is possible that genome compactness is encoded on a more local scale in specific regions of RNA. In particular, observations of Gopal et al [22] indicate that fold compactness seems to be encoded locally on a scale of 1000 nt. If this is indeed so, mutations targeting local regions of RNA secondary structure should consequently be able to disrupt the compactness more efficiently. It is therefore interesting to consider whether mutations concentrated on local, continuous stretches of the genome sequence or near the central branching hub of its secondary structure are more disruptive to the genome fold compactness than completely random mutations.",

In addition, we also consider disperse mutations picked uniformly (stochastically) along the genome to provide a comparison with existing studies. Based on previous studies, one might expect that (local) mutations targeting the nucleotides closest to the central, high-branching hub of a fold would be the most disruptive for its compactness, and that disperse mutations would be, conversely, the least disruptive. Instead, we find that the exact opposite is true, indicating that the compactness of viral ssRNA genomes is encoded on a global scale.",

The nucleotides in the batches are picked according to three different mutation schemes described further below. For each batch we independently generate 100 mutated sequences using non-synonymous point substitutions that approximately conserve the characteristic dinucleotide frequencies of the WT genomes. More precisely, the frequencies are allowed to vary by no more that 37.5% from the WT reference values (see the supplementary material available online at stacks.iop.org/ JPhysCM/30/084006/mmedia and [16] ). Additionally, we verified a posteriori that the results we obtain in this way are largely unaffected by substituting the dinucleotide frequency constraint with that of mononucleotide frequency constraint, based on the Fisher-Yates shuffling algorithm [35] .

Another key feature, conveyed by panel (b) of figures 3 and 4, is that there are no sensitive regions on the sequences of the two genomes, i.e. neither of them carries a continuous stretch of sequence whose disruption would completely erase fold compactness. A final noteworthy point is that even the largest batch of mutations with s = 720 nt (comprising \u223c20% of each genome) is not sufficient to disrupt the fold compactness, compared to the disruption achieved by a random shuffle of the entire genome. This is remarkable, as a similar percentage of more conservative (synonymous) mutations distributed randomly along the entire genome was shown to be much more disruptive, yielding the same MLD value as that of a random shuffle [16] .",

From the distance profiles one can also infer the number and degree of branching points and the number and size of branches by counting the minima of LD(i, C) at a given value of LD and the separation of the minima along the sequence.

Ranking the nucleotides according to their distance from the center of the fold enables us to group them into batches containing the nucleotides most proximal to the central hub of the fold-out of which the RNA secondary structure branches-as well as into batches containing the nucleotides furthermost from the center (see Methods). In the genomes of both viruses we thus mutate batches of nucleotides with different degrees of centrality: one batch type contains the 20% of the most central nucleotides, another batch type the 20% of the least central nucleotides, and the last batch type contains 20% of nucleotides with average centrality. The MLD distributions resulting from the mutations in these different batches are shown in figure 3(c) for BMV RNA2 and figure 4(c) for phage MS2. 5 Following the graph theoretical results, the center of a fold is either a single edge or a single node [33] . In our case, this means that every pair of nucleotides i, j in the center has either LD(i, j) = 0 or LD(i, j) = 1. Given an LD(i, C) profile, one loses information regarding the pairing in the center of the fold, but can still treat the portions of the distance profile included between two consecutive minima as mountain plots. Since we do not consider pseudoknots, these are sufficient to capture the general fold organization. For both viruses we observe that the resulting MLD distributions fall between the WT and the completely shuffled distributions. The support of these distributions is, in fact, largely compatible with that of block mutations discussed in the previous subsection. The most noticeable result is, however, that for the centrality-ranked mutations the largest disruption of the fold compactness is not due to the mutations targeting the most central region of the fold. This runs counter to the expectation that the central hub and the corresponding high-degree branching points of the fold would be the most crucial regions where the sequence-structure interplay would stabilize the fold compactness. Instead, the most sensitive regions appear to be those of mid-to large distance from center-and yet, even in these cases centrality-ranked mutations are not as disruptive as the random shuffling of the entire genome.",

Arguably, this strong tendency for the WT fold compactness has been evolutionary promoted as it facilitates genome encapsidation. From the point of view of the sequence-structure interplay in viral RNAs, several previous works have suggested that their compactness is largely due to the atypically high number of branching points, or hubs, of their genome folds [22, 23] .

Finally, we considered similar amounts of random mutations distributed randomly along the genome. We assessed the impact on compactness of each mutation scheme by computing the change in the MLD.

Figures 6(a) and (b) show that while all mutation schemes produce folds with lower pairing probability than the WT one, only disperse mutations result in folds where the amount of base-pairing is significantly lower in both viruses. The number of high-degree branching points in the folds (defined as hubs with more than five branches stemming from them) is also almost unaffected by any of the mutation schemes, showing a slight decrease again only in the case of disperse mutations (figures 6(c) and (d)). Other quantities, such as the average duplex length and the number of duplexes in a fold, remain constant under different mutation schemes and compared to the WT folds. Consequently, while the reduced fraction of paired nucleotides clearly correlates with the increased impact of disperse mutations, it is difficult to argue that the change in any other structural observable could be behind our observed differences in the effects of different mutation schemes on the compactness of WT folds. It thus remains to be seen whether it is a combination of these characteristic features of RNA secondary structure, such as the number of high-degree branching points and pairing probability, that is encoded on a global scale of the fold and affected most strongly by disperse mutations, or whether there is a yet unknown global property of folds that is responsible for it.",

Restricting considerations to such classes of graphs is the de facto standard for secondary structure prediction methods, because they are clearly much more amenable to extensive numerical characterization. However, it is known that as RNA length increases, the genus of the native fold (a measure of topological complexity and non-planarity) increases as well [36] . Therefore, pseudoknots and other non-planar elements may definitely be present in the WT folds of phage MS2 and BMV [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . Extending considerations, as well as the definition of MLD, to such cases is underway, based on the use of McGenus, a general (non-planar) secondary structure prediction scheme [36] . Secondly, for the sake of simplicity we have neglected other elements beyond MLD that are known to be important, such as electrostatic effects and the interactions of RNA with the capsid [42] [43] [44] .

Our findings clearly indicate that correlations due to sequence proximity help maintain the original properties of the fold under mutations to a much greater extent than in the case when the mutations are randomly distributed all along the sequence. Based on these results, we expect that further insight into the sequence-dependent robustness of viral RNA compactness could be gleaned from mapping out the reorganization of the network of secondary structure motifs due to mutations. This point could be profitably tackled in future studies by using a systematic analysis of the folds in terms of their contact maps and the Laplacian of their associated graphs.",
