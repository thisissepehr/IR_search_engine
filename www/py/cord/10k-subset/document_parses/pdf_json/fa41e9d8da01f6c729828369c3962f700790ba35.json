However, application of a pneumatic compressive device in patients with corresponding lower extremity fractures may not be possible. Traditionally, orthopaedic surgeons have been concerned about the effects of VTE prophylaxis on perioperative bleeding, which can result in hematoma, infection and wound problems. There has also been a concern that patients at low risk of developing symptomatic VTE may receive excessive anticoagulation 24 .

Abelseth et al. studied the incidence of DVT in 176 patients who had undergone operative fixation for fractures of the lower extremity distal to the hip and reported a 28% incidence of DVT (mostly distal asymptomatic DVTs) detected by screening for venography 16 . Goel et al. performed a randomised controlled trial of treating 238 patients who had undergone operative fixation for fractures of below-the-knee lower extremity with placebo or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and reported no significant difference in the incidence of DVT (8.7% in LMWH group vs 12.6% in placebo group) as detected by screening venography 17 . Niikura et al. studied the rate of VTE after complex lower-extremity fracture surgery consisting of temporary external fixator application followed by definitive internal fixation, and found a high incidence of VTE (38.5%, 15 out of 39 patients) was detected by contrast-enhanced CT without pharmacological prophylaxis, although no PEs were fatal 18 . In the present study, pelvic and lower-extremity fractures were assessed for symptomatic VTEs. The incidence of symptomatic VTE detected by CT angiography was 12.4% (45 out of 363 patients) and the incidence of symptomatic PE was 5.2% (19 out of 363 patients) with pharmacological prophylaxis applied. Although not directly comparable, the incidence of symptomatic VTE in the present study was high in post-traumatic patients with lower-extremity fractures, even with pharmacological prophylaxis. They reported an age of over 40 years, a lower-extremity fracture more than 3 points in abbreviated injury scale (AIS), applying a ventilator for more than 3 days, a head injury more than 3 points in AIS, venous injury, and cases requiring major operative procedure as risk factors. Wahlsten et al. studied 57,619 trauma patients and found that the incidence of VTE was low following surgery for fractures distal to the knee, but the risk increased with the presence of risk factors including use of oral contraception by patients eighteen to fifty years of age, previous DVT, previous PE, coagulopathy, and peripheral artery disease 28 . Furthermore, Thorson et al. prescreened 534 trauma patients with a risk assessment profile, and reported that high-risk profile score and pelvic fracture with prolonged intervention are independent predictors for VTE development, despite thromboprophylaxis 29 . However, few studies have reported the association between VTE incidence and patient factors such as sex, BMI, and underlying disease in trauma patients with fractures. In the present study, a higher Charlson comorbidity index and a history of external fixator application were associated with increased VTE risk. Among conditions for Charlson comorbidity index scoring, there were significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of peripheral vascular disease in patients who had VTE compared to patients without VTE (31.3% vs 1.3%, p < 0.001), and this may have influenced the results. Among patients who had VTE, male sex, and above-the-knee fractures were associated with increased PE risk. It is noteworthy that patients who had external fixator application were associated with increased VTE risk, and a longer period of immobilization would have contributed to thrombus formation in the vessels 4 . For the PE risk, up to 40% of proximal DVTs have an association with PE, and above-the-knee fractures would have caused more injury to the proximal vein, leading to formation and emboli of the thrombus at a more proximal area 30 . It was surprising to find being male as a risk factor for PE. Several studies have assessed the relationship between sex and incidence of VTE, and found the VTE recurrence rate is consistently higher in men, suggesting that higher prevalence of PE-associated proximal DVT in men partly accounts for the higher VTE recurrence rate in men 31, 32 . It is possible that the higher prevalence of PE-associated proximal DVT in men, as with above-the-knee fractures being a risk factor for PE, is associated with PE risk in patients with pelvic and lower-extremity fractures.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 483, "end": 485, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1200, "end": 1202, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2336, "end": 2338, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2354, "end": 2380, "text": "Thorson et al. prescreened", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2598, "end": 2600, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3746, "end": 3748, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 4088, "end": 4091, "text": "31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 4092, "end": 4094, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Figure 1."}, {"text": "This study has several limitations. First, two different LMWHs were used as there was institutional formulary change in LMWH prophylaxis from Dalteparin to Enoxaparin. However, as effectiveness of Dalteparin and Enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis after traumatic injury has been reported to be similar by numerous studies [33] [34] [35] , the effect of differing LMWH prophylaxis on VTE occurrence should have been minimal. In a study that included 5880 trauma patients, the VTE rate was 3.3/1000 days in the Enoxaparin period vs 3.8/1000 days in Dalteparin period proving similar prophylactic effect of both LMWHs in trauma patients 33 . Second, only patients eligible to use pharmacological anti-coagulation prophylaxis were enrolled. Patients with co-existing head, chest, or abdominal trauma requiring treatment were excluded from the study. The findings in our study cannot be generalised to severely traumatised patients with a high ISS or those requiring intensive-care unit hospitalization. Third, as this was a single-institution study, it may not reflect universal practices, and the number of patients assessed was relatively small, accounting for the low incidence of PE. Fourth, symptoms of VTE were subjectively assessed by the senior surgeon, and selection bias issue may be an issue. Fifth, it is not possible to directly compare the results between studies due to inhomogeneity in study populations, VTE prophylaxis, and detection methods.
