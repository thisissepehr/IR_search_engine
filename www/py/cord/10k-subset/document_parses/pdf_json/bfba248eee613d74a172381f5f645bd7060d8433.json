Recently, Nick et al. found that high-and low-blood expression of a set of interferon-stimulated genes (MX1, IFIT1, and ISG15) identified a set of ARDS patients with worse outcomes. Morrell et al., analyzed peripheral blood monocyte gene expression by microarray and found increased interferon signaling in ARDS patients with a favorable outcome (i.e. more ventilator-free days) compared to ARDS patients with fewer ventilator-free days [34] . Thus, it is enticing to hypothesize that modulation of interferon signaling pathways represents a treatment approach for HSCT subjects, but additional data are required to support such a strategy. Interestingly, a recently completed phase 3 trial of human interferon beta 1a for moderate-to-severe ARDS did not find a significant difference in the primary composite endpoint of mortality and ventilator free days [35, 36] . Although the administration of interferon beta 1a was not efficacious in this population of unselected patients, it is possible that assessing whether interferon signaling pathways are activated in ARDS patients might provide a more targeted approach to treatment. Our study is the first to use RNA-Seq in order to determine whether the specific ARDS subphenotype of HSCT-ARDS has a unique peripheral blood gene expression profile. Our patients were carefully selected from a single center and although sample size was small, this proof-of-concept study provides insights that are valuable to design future studies. We chose age-and sex-matched subjects to limit heterogeneity for this initial study, though we note that this may limit the generalizability of our findings. Another limitation of our study is the use of peripheral blood RNA, which is derived from a mixture of cell types. Although there were no significant differences in differential cell counts between groups, it is possible that gene expression profiles could be affected by subtle changes in cell maturity between groups. For example, blood gene expression profiles of patients with ARDS may have been dominated by systemic inflammation when compared to subjects without ARDS [37] . We focused our study on two subgroups of ARDS patients, presumably with similar degrees of inflammation, in order to identify differences in gene expression that may explain heterogeneity amongst different types of ARDS patients. Our two groups were similar in demographic characteristics and severity of lung injury and overall illness, but still demonstrated clinical heterogeneity. While our results suggest that gene expression differences were not due to HSCT itself, we are unable to rule out the effect of potential confounders such as immunosuppressant medications. Notably, all of the patients in the ARDS-HSCT group were being treated with moderate-to-high dose corticosteroids at the time of inclusion, whereas half of the non-HSCT ARDS patients were on moderate dose corticosteroids. Another potential confounder is the possibility of undiagnosed infections. To address this issue, we analyzed reads from our RNA-Seq data that did not map to the human genome and performed taxonomic classification to look for the presence of common pathogens. Although our data did not suggest the presence of an undiagnosed bloodstream infection, this analysis was limited by the sample size, the fact that some respiratory pathogens might not exhibit a bloodstream signature, and the fact that the majority of bacterial RNA are not polyadenylated and may have been eliminated during the library preparation process. Finally, our samples were collected over the course of five years during which a new definition of ARDS was adopted, [1] and thus, it is possible that multiple definitions could have unintentionally impacted our results. Patients who have undergone HSCT are at heightened risk for a number of types of lung injury including pulmonary infections as well as non-infectious lung injury such as drug-induced pneumonitis, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and idiopathic pneumonia syndrome. Given the lack of well-defined diagnostic criteria for many of these entities, other investigators have focused on the epidemiology of the most severe form of lung injury (i.e. ARDS) regardless of the etiology and found that ARDS after allo-HSCT is common and has high mortality [12] . We used a similar strategy for our study choosing not to focus on the proximal cause of lung injury. One limitation of this strategy is that it is difficult to determine whether the transcriptomic changes in the ARDS-HSCT population reflect the different underlying etiologies of ARDS, differential host responses, or most likely both. Interestingly, the majority of patients in the HSCT-ARDS group were suspected of having idiopathic pneumonia syndrome and received treatment with etanercept. While the effect of etanercept on peripheral blood gene expression in critical illness is not known, studies in autoimmune diseases have found differential regulation of interferon pathways. For example, OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, and IFI44L appear to be down-regulated by etanercept in responders to treatment for psoriasis [38] . However, in a set of patients treated with infliximab for rheumatoid arthritis, treatment induced an increase in interferon response genes including OAS1 and OAS2 in a subset of patients who had poor clinical response; [39] a subsequent study including patients on a variety of anti-TNF therapies including etanercept also found divergent responses in interferon profiles, though did not find an association with clinical response [40] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 577, "end": 581, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 997, "end": 1001, "text": "[35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1002, "end": 1005, "text": "36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2256, "end": 2260, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 3794, "end": 3797, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 4437, "end": 4441, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 5254, "end": 5258, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 5480, "end": 5484, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 5692, "end": 5696, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "ARDS is a heterogeneous syndrome, with a diverse set of risk factors, etiologies, and outcomes.

Transcript levels of several of the most differentially expressed genes were measured by qPCR to confirm changes found by RNA-seq. n = 3/group, *p < 0.05 vs ARDS by unpaired t-test. Figure S2 . Taxonomic classification of unmapped reads within each patient sample after human read removal. Relative read count indicates the fraction of reads belonging to a given genus out of all reads classified to at least genus-level specificity. Genera with minimum read fraction of 2% within a sample are displayed (otherwise collapsed into \"Other\"). No dramatic classwise differences are observed, and the lack of a recurrent abundant pathogen unique to ARDS-SCT patients suggests that undiagnosed bloodstream infection is an unlikely cause of ARDS in these SCT patients.
