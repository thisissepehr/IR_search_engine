A more efficient use of calories for anabolic purposes applies to this period. Therefore neuroendocrine mechanisms that decrease catabolic and promote anabolic metabolism must be operating. Indeed, oxytocin has been shown to induce several energy-saving physiological adaptations such as induction of sedation, elevation of painthreshold, reduction of tail-skin temperature (Uvn~is-Moberg, 1989 , 1994 and endocrine changes, including increasing levels of insulin and cholecystokinin (CCK) (Lindrn et al., 1990a) , and a decreasing level of growth hormone (GH) (Hulting & Uvnas-Moberg et al., in preparation) , allowing anabolism to fat rather than to protein. These data taken together indicate that oxytocin might have a long-term effect on weight gain by influencing both food intake and the intensity of anabolic metabolism.",

Also supporting the central role of oxytocin in weight gain and food intake is the fact that i.c.v, injections of 5-10 /.tg of oxytocin is accompanied by a higher weight gain and food intake than that of NaCl-treated control rats (Bj6rkstrand & Uvnas-Moberg, 1995) . Other central effects can also be induced by both s.c. and i.c.v, administration of oxytocin. In a previous experiment we have shown that oxytocin may induce an anxiolytic-like effect and a sedative effect by both s.c. and i.c.v. injections. Again, 100 to 1,000-fold higher doses were required for s.c. administration (Uvn~is-Moberg et al., 1994) . Here s.c. administration of oxytocin was used, since this route of administration is less stressful to the animals than is i.c.v, administration, and allows long-term studies on development of weight over several estrous cycles. It is not known by which mechanisms oxytocin stimulates weight gain in the SGR. The differential effect of oxytocin during various stages of the estrous cycle deserves some attention. As shown by others, and in the present study, female rats lose weight in proestrus-estrus and gain weight in metestrus-diestrus (Tarttelin & Gorski, 1971) . No further effects from the use of oxytocin were seen in metestrus and diestrus, when maximal weight gain occurred spontaneously. Possibly endogenous levels of progesterone and estrogen may have optimized endogenous oxytocinergic effects on weight gain during this phase of the cycle. In contrast, oxytocin could increase weight gain during periods of the cycle when weight gain is low.",

The present results indicate that this effect can be overcome by high levels of oxytocin.

It is possible that no further growth-promoting effect could be induced against this neuroendocrine background, perhaps mediating maximal growth by itself. Thus, different types of oxytocin-mediated effects may be expressed depending on the neuroendocrine profile of the rats receiving oxytocin.
