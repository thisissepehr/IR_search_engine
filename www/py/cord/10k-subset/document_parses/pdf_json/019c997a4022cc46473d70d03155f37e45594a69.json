Tracheostomy is associated with appreciable morbidity. Controversy still exists about the optimal management of postoperative airways in oral cancer patients. Recently there has been move towards use of elective tracheostomy for oral and maxillofacial oncological operations to selected cases only. Aims: (1) Audit the rates of elective tracheostomy in oral cancer patients following neck dissection. (2) Identify factors that determine elective tracheostomy needs in our cohort of patients requiring neck dissection. Materials and method: This is a retrospective study on all cases of oral cancer patient with neck dissection done between Jan 2012 to Dec 2012 in the National Maxillofacial Unit, St James's hospital. Data will be collected for Site of tumour, Mandibulectomy status, Neck dissection unilateral or bilateral, Reconstruction means, whether tracheostomy was performed and pertinent patient demographic information. The tracheostomy scoring system will be applied on this cohort. Risk factor analysis for elective tracheostomy in this cohort of patients will be performed. Results: Preliminary data suggests that elective tracheostomy rates are low and comparable with UK centres. Conclusion: Oral cancer patients have a potential difficult airway. Our study showed that oral cancer patients can be managed safely without the routine use of a tracheostomy. Selective tracheostomy will greatly improve the time management in the theatre, reduce unnecessary need for surgical ICU prescription and length of stay. Derangements in blood result post surgery must be properly investigated and appropriately managed or else one runs the risk of serious implications. HITTS is a rarity in patients being treated with heparin but it has a significant morbidity and mortality associated with it. A 60-year-old right hand dominant lady with Klippel Feil Syndrome was admitted to A&E following a mechanical fall. She suffered the following injuries: fracture of right proximal femur and fracture of her right distal radius. She was a challenging intubation and underwent surgery for open reduction and internal fixation of her right forearm fracture and long gamma nail insertion of her right femur fracture.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 692, "end": 695, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "An Audit on Tracheostomy Need After Surgery for Oral Cancer in a Cohort of Oral Cancer Patients in a Dublin Hospital in 2012"}, {"text": "Her post operative course was complicated by slow rehabilitation and on day 8 post surgery she developed a swollen right thigh and her routine daily bloods showed a drop in platelets of greater than 60 %.

However, upon processing the permanent histology there was noted to be tissue staining positively for neuroendocrine markers, consistent with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour (NET) metastatic to a spinal haemangioblastoma. To our knowledge, this entity has only been reported in one patient previously [1] . where he required TPN and pleural drain insertion for a persistent right-sided empyema. Our patient was eventually discharged well, 2 months post admission. He has been counselled on the importance of abstinence and is being seen regularly as an outpatient.

Data collected included FEV1, age of Pa acquisition, eradication treatment, number of positive Pa isolates and use of long term nebulised antibiotics. Patients were then classified using the Leeds Criteria, based on positive Pa cultures [2] . Results: The median age of first Pa acquisition was 50 months. 57.6 % of patients had a positive isolate of Pa with initial eradication therapy successful in 63.3 %. 45.9 % of all patients are on long-term nebulised antibiotics. Patients were classified using the Leeds Criteria and there is a significant difference (p = 0.046) in the mean weight centile between those classified as Chronic or Intermittent (44.7th centile) and those as Free or Never (59th centile). Conclusion: Determining the prevalence, and degree of Pa infection, is important both in the current management of Pa, and in efficient implementation and evaluation of future guidelines. Close monitoring of patient vital signs after interventional procedures is important as complications can often present insidiously. Objective findings of pain in the procedure site can be nonspecific. Given that many procedures are undertaken inside body cavities bleeding may go unnoticed for some time.

Case: 28-year-old male pedestrian brought to the emergency department after being hit by a truck, with a crush injury to his right leg and groin. He was managed following ATLS protocol. Significant blood loss necessitated numerous transfusions; his condition remained critical. Examination and imaging demonstrated multiple fractures in the right superior and inferior rami, coccyx and an open contaminated comminuted fracture of the right femur. There was degloving of his right thigh and buttock, and anal sphincter disruption. He was taken emergently to theatre for right femoral vein repair and laparoscopic defunctioning colostomy by the Colorectal team. A right retrograde femoral nail was inserted by the Orthopaedic team. He underwent wound debridements of his right thigh and buttock and VAC dressings post-operatively. A split thickness graft was placed after several weeks along with prophylactic antimicrobials for 6 weeks. His condition gradually improved. Repeat Xrays confirmed good callus formation and progressive weight bearing was recommended. Intense MDT input facilitated home discharge 3 months later.

Introduction: Currently the Manchester Triage Scale (MTS) is used in Irish Accident and Emergency Departments. This focuses on medical and surgical presentations to the Emergency Department (ED), but fails to provide guidance on triaging psychiatric presentations [1] . More than 12,000 people presented to emergency departments in Ireland following an episode of self-harm in 2011 [2] . 1 in 5 such individuals repeat self-harm within 3 months, with up to 15 % of patients leaving the ED without a psychosocial assessment [2] . The National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines and The HSE's National Emergency Medicine Programme Report (June 2012) recommend the introduction of a Mental Health Triage (MHT) scale. Aim: To examine the effectiveness of a MHT Scale in assessing patients presenting with self-harm. Methods: Ten vignettes were created using details from case files of 10 patients who had presented to Cork University Hospital ED, with deliberate self-harm. Nurses (n = 49) were given five vignettes (with a range of presentations) and asked to assign each vignette to a triage category, using MTS. Each nurse was subsequently asked to reevaluate the same vignettes using the MHT Scale. MTS and MHT both have scales of one-five which are directly comparable. Triage with each method was deemed safe or unsafe, using the triage score from two expert consultant opinions (Psychiatrist and Emergency Medicine) as the gold standard. Familiarity with the concept of MHT and education provided to nurses was also assessed. Results: In total the study examined 245 triaged cases. There was a significant change in the categories assigned when the MHT scale was in use, p \\ 0.001. The triage categories assigned using the MHT scale were significantly safer than under the MTS scale (79 vs. 60 % safe respectively, p \\ 0.001). Conclusion: The use of a MHT Scale appears to reduce the number of patients that would be under-triaged by the currently used Manchester Triage Scale. [1] .

Background: Consent is the giving of permission or agreement for an intervention following a process of communication about a proposed intervention. The task of providing information and seeking consent can only be carried out by someone who is suitably trained and qualified. It is essential that the patient's agreement to the procedure and the discussion that led up to the agreement are clearly documented [1] . Aims: The purpose of this study was to conduct a chart audit to identify who is obtaining informed consent from patients, and the level of detail with which informed consent is being recorded in the patients' records. Methods: An audit of 88 patient charts for elective surgical cases was carried out in order to collect information on the recording of informed consent. For 39.8 % of the cases consent was obtained by interns, for 54.5 % consent was obtained by Non-Consultant Hospital Doctors (NCHDs), and 4.5 % of the time consent was obtained by a Consultant. In either the charts or the consent form the following information was recorded: risks disclosed (39.8 % of the time), risks itemised (34.1 % of the time), risk percentages (4.5 % of the time), risk of death noted (6.8 % of the time). Conclusion: It is important that doctors ensure that the consent process has been adequately recorded to avoid the potential for litigation.

Intussusception occurs when a proximal segment of the gastrointestinal tract called the intussusceptum telescopes into the lumen of an adjacent segment, known as the intussuscipiens.

Intussusception is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in the paediatric population between 6 and 36 months of age [1] .

Barriers to consent identified by the doctors and nurses were poor consent forms, lack of time, and patients' lack of understanding. It was universally agreed by both doctors and nurses that there was considerable variation in how patients were consented. Patients, doctors, and nurses proposed that clear information leaflets, videos, and pro-forma consent forms designed for specific procedures would be beneficial to the consent process. It was suggested this would improve both patient understanding, standardise the consent process, and protect doctors from litigation. Conclusion: Healthcare professionals believe that more explicit procedures and documentation would improve the quality and standardisation of the consent process from doctor to doctor. The procedure was documented in medical notes in only two patients, and patient consent was documented in only one case. Conclusion: Large deficiencies in recording the indication for catheter insertion, documentation of the procedure itself and recording of patient consent obtained are evident. In this study, 42.8 % of documented reasons for catheterisation were inappropriate. The use of a standardised form that includes clinical indication that could be filled and added to medical notes each time a urinary catheterisation is performed by medical or nursing staff could address many of these issues.

Risk factors included: history of spinal trauma or surgery (n = 21, 33 %); CKD (n = 8, 13 %); UTI (n = 8, 13 %); diabetes (n = 7, 11 %); malignant disease (n = 6, 10 % Background: Heart failure is a very common medical condition and affects approximately 4.5-7.2/1,000 cases for people over 45-yearsold [1] . The 5 year survival rate is typically between 25 and 38 % [1] . It is important that heart failure is managed well in order to improve patients' outcomes. Aims: I looked into whether heart failure is managed appropriately in our main population of patients according to the NICE guidelines. Method: I looked into the medical records of all 45 medical patients in St Coman's ward on 9th November 2013 looking at symptoms of heart failure based on the Framingham criteria, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels and echocardiogram results available from the Roscommon Hospital records and diagnosed them with heart failure according to the NICE guidelines [2] . I also looked at the patient's list of medications as well as vitals at current admission. I excluded patients with symptoms of heart failure but without both BNP and echocardiogram reports. Results: Out of 45 medical inpatients, eight patients had symptoms of heart failure with both echocardiogram reports and raised BNP. Based on the NICE guidelines, only one patient had an ejection fraction of \\40 %, while seven others has preserved ejection fraction. Our lone patient with decreased ejection fraction should be on an angiotensinconverting-enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blockers as well as beta-blockers with diuretics used as symptomatic relief [2] . As for the rest of our patients with preserved heart function heart failure, the guidelines recommend that the patient's co-morbidities be managed accordingly with diuretics given for symtomatic control [2] . Four out of seven of those patients had atrial fibrillation, three of them had hypertension and none had diabetes mellitus or a previous myocardial infarction. As recommended by the NICE guidelines, patients with atrial fibrillation should be rate controlled below 90 bpm [3] ; 75 % were rate controlled below 90 bpm while 25 % had a rate of 100-110 bpm. One patient had uncontrolled hypertension. Discussion: Based on this audit, patients were mostly well managed in terms of heart failure management. However risk factors management for heart failure could be better managed. This study was limited in the small sample size and patients without echocardiography and BNP levels despite having heart failure symptoms. 34-year-old gentleman with a history of worsening fatigue, profound atraumatic bruising and an episode of epistaxis presented to Sligo Regional Hospital without significant medical history. He denied recent infections and B cell symptoms. On examination, he had splenomegaly, measuring 6 cm, with no palpable lymphadenopathy or hepatomegaly. A bone marrow biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of HCL. He was commenced on Cladribine, in accordance with the British Committee of Haematology Standards (BCHS) guidelines. He remained asymptomatic for 4 years before relapsing. His progressive symptoms warranted with Cladribine and Rituximab, adhering to the BCHS guidelines for relapsed HCL. Following his first dose of Rituximab, the patient became hypotensive, tachypneoic, tachycardic and started de-saturating. Believing that he developed cytokine release syndrome, Rituximab was withheld. Two further episodes of being acutely unwell after infusions of Rituximab ensued, rendering the patient unsuitable for the medication. Rituximab has been reported to elicit a reaction similar to graft-versus-host disease, given its chimeric nature. Hence, Rituximab was substituted for Ofatumumab, a human monoclonal antibody that targets an epitope of CD20 molecule, different to that targeted by Rituximab. After six cycles of chemotherapy with Ofatumumab, a repeat bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence of HCL. He has since been followed up in outpatients and remains symptom-free.

Background: International literature shows that CKD is a largely underdiagnosed disease, particularly in its earlier stages, with suboptimal management of clinical measurements such as blood pressure and proteinuria. The only previous study carried out in Ireland from a general practice perspective showed a prevalence rate of 16.7 % for patients over 50 years of age screened in three practices in Galway in 2008, with only 13 % of these patients having a documented diagnosis of CKD recorded. Aims: To assess the prevalence and management of CKD patients in a socio-economically deprived area of Dublin's inner city. Secondary aim was to identify and develop a register of patients with CKD in Rialto Medical Centre. Methods: The Irish Primary Care Research Network tool on Socrates general practice software was used to identify all patients with an eGFR \\60 mL/min. All patients identified were then coded using ICPC/ICD-10 codes to identify them as having CKD, for the purpose of creating a practice register. These patients' charts were then examined and documentation of age, comorbidities, CVS risk management, nephrotoxic drugs, vaccinations and whether or not they had received a specialist referral were analysed. Measurements were scrutinised for adherence to the Irish Nephrology Society's guidelines for management of CKD in primary care, in order to assess the quality of care given. Results: The overall prevalence of CKD was 14.5 % in our practice population, the vast majority of whom were aged over 55 years and had comorbid diabetes mellitus, hypertension or CVS disease. Of these patients, only 14 % were coded in Socrates as having been diagnosed with CKD, highlighting the underdiagnosis of this major morbidity. Adherence to treatment with RAS blockade, lipid-lowering therapy and aspirin were generally good (all [90 %) but documentation of urinalysis results & microalbumin testing were poor, with \\20 % documentation rates for these two variables. 6 % of patients with CKD were concerningly prescribed nephrotoxic drugs.

Introduction: Lemierre's Syndrome (LS), historically described as postanginal sepsis, is an extremely rare complication of oropharyngeal infections in the era of widespread antibiotic use. The syndrome primarily affects adolescents and young adults. It is an infectious thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein (IJV) characterised by a constellation of signs and symptoms ranging from fever and localised neck swelling, to arthritic pain, neurological signs and sudden thoracic pain. Fusobacterium Necrophorum, a gram-negative, anaerobic bacillus with strong biologically destructive properties, is the usual causative agent. A coloniser of the oropharynx, gastrointestinal and female genital tract, F. Necrophorum exerts its highly pathogenic effects via a number of virulence factors including polysaccharide endotoxin, leukocidin, haemolysin and haemagglutanin which potentiate platelet aggregation and septic thrombus formation. IJV thrombosis is typically initiated within 10 days of onset of oropharyngeal infections, leading to septic thrombus formation and potential metastases of septic microemboli . The reported incidence of LS is one per million per year, with a mortality rate of between 5 and 20 %. Background/method: We present the case of a 28-year-old male who was admitted to the emergency department with an acute onset rightsided neck mass, fever, and lethargy whilst being treated with antibiotics for tonsillopharyngitis. We explore the pathophysiological mechanisms of this syndrome, and outline our diagnostic and therapeutic approach to his care. Conclusion: The current trend of judicious management of tonsillopharyngitis without antibiotics has led to a recent resurgence of this forgotten, deadly disease. The rarity of the condition means that a paucity of treatment guidelines exists, and therefore management depends strongly on a multidisciplinary team approach. This case delineates the importance of maintaining LS on one's clinical radar, as delayed diagnosis can lead to catastrophic complications. Background: Neonatal thyrotoxicosis is a rare and life-threatening condition caused by transplacental transfer of maternal thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins in mothers with autoimmune thyroid disease [1] . Clinical features of neonatal thyrotoxicosis include tachycardia, goitre, prominent eyes and poor weight gain but presenting symptoms may be non-specific, particularly in the premature or intrauterine growth retarded infant and clinical features may mimic other conditions such as neonatal sepsis [2] .

Introduction: Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric condition that can occur due to medical or psychiatric disorders. It is characterized by mutism, stupor, refusal to eat/drink, posturing and excitement or hypokinesis [1] . The prevalence of catatonia is unknown and is possibly under-diagnosed by psychiatrists and physicians [2] . It occurs most often in patients with an underlying mood disorder [3] . We report a case of catatonia and Cotard's Syndrome in a 61-year-old Irish male. We also highlight the misdiagnosis of catatonia as a behavioural disorder, the rapid response of a catatonic patient to intramuscular Lorazepam and the effectiveness of ECT and Nortriptyline in the treatment of psychotic depression. Case report: Our team was asked to provide a second opinion on the case of Mr. RC, a retired 61-year-old, Irish, male with a 6-month history of mutism, hypokinesis and stupor.

One of the earliest cellular responses to oxysterols is an increase in intracellular calcium concentration.

On examination, she was disorientated and cortically blind with no awareness of her visual deficit (Anton's syndrome). She was commenced on anti-epileptic drugs, however developed phenytoin-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The constituents of her cerebrospinal fluid were normal. MRI brain showed bilateral cortical T2 hyperintensity in the parieto-occipital regions and bilateral posterior thalamic hyperintensities. Electroencephalogram showed periodic lateralised epileptiform discharges in the right hemisphere posteriorly. She developed septic shock requiring ICU admission where she received antibiotics and a course of intravenous immunoglobulin but unfortunately continued to deteriorate and died. Serum anti-NMDA-R antibodies were positive and histopathological examination of the resected teratoma revealed neural tissue. At brain autopsy there was severe gliosis in the occipital cortex bilaterally extending to the thalami symmetrically. We postulate that antibodies formed against teratomal brain tissue cross-reacted with native NMDA receptors. Discussion: Anti-NMDA-R encephalitis classically affects young women who present with psychiatric, neurological and autonomic symptoms. Ovarian teratomas are detected in 62 % of affected women [1] . CSF, brain imaging and electroencephalogram findings can be non-specific so a high index of suspicion is required. Early empiric treatment with IVIg, intravenous corticosteroids and/or plasma exchange may reverse the disease process. The overall prognosis is good, particularly in younger patients, with 75 % of cases recovering with minimal deficits [1] .

The Hypothalamic-Pituitary axis could not be assessed as the patient was on high dose steroids as part of her management for brain metastases but there was evidence of hypothyroidism, hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism and growth hormone deficiency. In view of her history of polyruria and polydipsia, Diabetes Insipidus was suspected and a water deprivation test was organised. A diagnosis of partial diabetes insipidus was established.

Emerging evidence suggests that AKI is under-recognised in clinical practice, and predicts an accelerated risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end stage kidney disease (ESKD). The epidemiology of AKI in the Irish Health System is poorly characterised with limited data on the frequency and clinical impact. Aim: To determine the incidence of, recovery rates from and outcomes of AKI in the Irish population. Methods: We determined incidence rates and recovery rates from AKI in 207, 336 adults, age 18 and over, within the Irish health system from 2005 to 2011. The diagnosis and severity of AKI was based on standardised creatinine measurements using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) AKI classification. A 'baseline median creatinine' was determined within 3 months prior to the AKI episode. Incidence rates were calculated as the number of AKI events per 1,000 person-years and were determined for each age and sex-specific group. Recovery was defined as complete (return of function to within 1.10 times baseline); partial (between 1.10 and 1.50 times baseline), or failure to recover (serum creatinine [1.50 times baseline or need for dialysis) within a 28-day time frame of initial creatinine rise.

This level of efficiency from admission to discharge is more difficult to attain when dealing with surgical emergency lists. Delayed hospital discharges potentially cost the state over \u20ac500,000 per night [1] .

Background: Management of splenic injuries has progressed considerably from the radical approach of near-automatic splenectomy for victims of splenic trauma in the era of Hamilton Bailey. Nowadays the emphasis has shifted to more conservative non-operative management if possible. However even in this era of advanced diagnostics and increasing excellence in trauma care, splenic trauma remains challenging. There is also an increasing recognition that traditional binary decisions in FAST need to evolve towards more nuanced recognition of organ architectural disruption and sonographic injury pattern. Methods: A case report of blunt left-upper quadrant trauma with a contained splenic haematoma. Results: A 35-year-old gentleman presented electively to participate in a FAST education session. While undergoing sonography of left upper quadrant, an obvious well-circumscribed infra-diaphragmatic cystic area was identified. The immediate differential was that of a splenic cyst or even an abnormality of the gastric fundus, encroaching into the splenic area.

Methods: Retrospective study of stroke patients thrombolysed in Galway University Hospital from August 2012 to October 2013(n = 15). Data including glucose levels pre and post thrombolysis, HbA1C and discharge medications was collected. Glycaemic control of patients within 24 h following thormbolysis was analysed.

He presented previously with the same symptoms 3 weeks prior and was worked up as a stroke. CT brain at the time revealed subtle areas of low attenuation in the right occipital region. His delayed presentation was a contraindication for thrombolysis. He was subsequently treated with high dose antiplatelet and best medical therapy.

Repeat imaging showed resolving epidural abscesses but two new mycotoic aortic aneurysms were noted and vascular surgery opinion was sought. Discussion: Invasive streptococcus pneumonia is an uncommon but serious infection with a high mortality rate. Pneumococcal septic arthritis, epidural abscesses and mycotic aneurysms are considered relatively rare occurrences but here we describe a case involving all three. Introduction: Stiff person syndrome is an exceedingly rare medical condition. There are only 150 cases published in the medical literature [1] . It is under-diagnosed and under-treated due a lack of awareness in the medical community. Early diagnosis and appropriate management avoids unnecessary investigations and procedures and improves the patient's quality of life. Case description: A 25-year-old veterinary nurse presented with an 11 day history of severe, acute-on-chronic lower back pain and opisthotonic spasms. Her medical history was significant for cystic fibrosis, CF-related arthropathy, DIOS and a domestic cat bite 3 weeks previous. Her pain was refractory to oxynorm, oxycontin, diazepam and gabapentin on the ward. She was transferred to ICU and commenced on morphine sulfate, midazolam, baclofen and gaba-pentin. As the frequency of her spasms increased, she was intubated and ventilated for pain control. An extensive battery of investigations came back normal. The case was complicated by the challenges of weaning sedation and managing an intercurrent IECF, a flare of DIOS and panic attacks. It was only as sedation was weaned that a rare diagnosis of Stiff Person Syndrome came to light. This facilitated better management and ultimately a successful discharge. Discussion: Our case sheds more light on a clinically elusive medical condition. It highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to accurate diagnosis in unusual or unfamiliar presentations. Interestingly, it also demonstrates the challenges of an MDT approach to the management of a patient with multiple biological, psychological and social comorbidities. Background: This random audit was performed to help decrease the potential medication related morbidity of inpatients. Aims: To highlight to NCHDs the necessity to pay more vigilance in transcribing drugs on admission in order to decrease potential iatrogenic harm to inpatients. Also to highlight to general practitioners the importance of having full lists of medications available for their patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1758, "end": 1761, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Galway University Hospital, Galway; NUI Galway Intern Training Network"}, {"text": "Method: Fifty inpatients were randomly selected for this audit.

Background: Anaemia is a very common asymptomatic condition in the older population and although these patient often present with a mild anaemia, it has been associated with increased levels of morbidity and mortality [1] . The prevalence of anaemia in this population has been shown to have increased, particularly in the last 10 years [2] . St. John's Hospital in Limerick is a Secondary Hospital with capacity for approximately 94 patients, most of who are over the age of 65 years.

The majority of patients had what appeared to be a mixed pathology anaemia (9), seven patients presented with a normocytic anaemia, one with a macrocytic anaemia and one with a microcytic anaemia. Of those who presented with a mixed pathology anaemia six had Iron studies carried out during their admission including Ferritin studies, Folate and Vitamin B12, one underwent a colonoscopy/gastroscopy but had no Iron studies and two had no investigation carried out. Of those who presented with normocytic anaemia one patient had both Iron studies and a colonoscopy/gastroscopy, one had Iron studies alone, one had a colonoscopy/gastroscopy alone and four had no investigations carried out. In relation to the patient with macrocytic anaemia, Iron studies were carried out whilst the patient with microcytic anaemia had a colonoscopy/gastroscopy. Thus overall, six patients, representing 33.3 % of those who presented with a Hb of 10.5 or lower on or during admission did not have any appropriate investigations carried out to determine the cause of their mild anaemia. Conclusion: 66.6 % of patients who presented with mild anaemia on or during their admission to St. John's Hospital were appropriately investigated for the possible cause for their presentation. The remaining 33.3 % underwent no investigations; one of the possible reasons for this could include previously known and investigated chronic anaemia prior to presentation. However the audit did reveal a deficit that warrants the creation of a protocol whereby the investigation of mild anaemia is approached methodically and appropriately. This protocol could be implemented during teaching or indeed introduced into the Intern handbook.

This study was carried out to evaluate the satisfaction felt among GPs, in Co Mayo, with communication from MGH. To achieve this, a questionnaire was circulated to all GPs aiming to highlight existing problems. Methods: A questionnaire was designed which assessed various aspects including the speed of communication, acceptable waiting times, effect on patient care, dictated versus electronic discharge summaries and disparity between hospital departments. It consisted of 12 questions, all multiple choice, and 3 included comment boxes to gather further information and suggestions for improvement. It was posted to the 79 practicing GPs in Co Mayo. Results: We based our findings on 37 completed questionnaires. Overall, a lack of satisfaction was felt with the speed of communication. For example, 41 % of GPs felt unsatisfied and 51 % very unsatisfied with the speed of communication after outpatient appointments. 94 % of GPs felt that these delays effected patient care. 81 % felt that there is disparity between hospital specialities. In relation to edischarge letters, the majority of GPs felt that they are as comprehensive as previously dictated letters. Various suggestions on improvements were made including communication with GPs via the web based national health link program. Conclusion: Overall, this study highlighted that the communication from MGH needs significant improvement to ensure optimal continuity of patient care. Following on from this, the aim is to make all doctors in MGH aware of this issue and began devising steps of improvement. Introduction: Case studies documenting side effects appeared in the very first year of cortisone becoming commercialised [1] . In clinical practice there is a high rate of individual variability in terms of reaction time and severity with features ranging from mild to a psychiatric syndrome that fully meets the criteria [2] . Mania or hypomania has always been the most common with depression, panic attacks and psychosis also documented [3] . Case: We report a case of steroid-induced mania following 1 month of high dose corticosteroid treatment for graft versus host disease in a 36-year-old lady with no past psychiatric history. The consequent course was long and complicated with relapse, need for alteration in treatment and subsequent depression. Discussion: This case demonstrates how complicated the treatment of steroid-induced mania can become. It is not simply a case of reducing steroids and using a psychotropic. The steroids are in use for a reason and in this case there came a time when they had to be re-increased resulting in a complimentary augmentation of psychiatric medications. One criticism of management here is that everyone involved used terms varying from psychosis to mania to mood disorder and each may have had a different concept of what these mean and their severity. Use of agreed terminology and a validated rating scale could be useful in comparing staff's impression of a given patient from one meeting to the next. We also believe that viewing steroid-induced psychiatric disorder through a biopsychosocial approach is more beneficial than treating it as an isolated agent. Conclusion: This case demonstrates the serious psychiatric side effects that can occur due to corticosteroids, particularly in the oncological setting where high doses are frequently used. Important warning factors include insomnia and irritability. While Olanzapine has been found to be highly effective there are a number of potential side effects, one of which delayed recovery in this case. In treating these conditions a biopsychosocial approach should be used. While steroids were the predominant trigger in this case, multiple contributing factors are often present.

Introduction: Ankle sprains are one of the most common injuries presenting to emergency departments, representing 3-5 % of all visits in the UK, and 10 % of all injury-related visits in the USA. Ankle ligamentous sprain injury is the most common single type of acute sport trauma. Over the years, various preventative strategies have been implemented; however, a recent epidemiology revealed that ankle sprain injury still dominated in sport injury, as it accounted for 14 % of all attendance in an accident and emergency department. Among ankle injuries, ankle sprain injury accounts for more than 80 %, and is also the most common single type of sport-related trauma among all body sites.

He was transferred to our service where he proceeded to further testing. An MR venogram showed a large partially necrotic renal mass compatible with RCC with renal sinus and renal vein extension. The mass abutted the posterior right lobe of the liver and a thrombus extending into the right atrium was again confirmed. At this point the working diagnosis was an extensive renal cell carcinoma with definite cardiopulmonary involvement. CT brain and a bone scan were fortunately clear. A trans-thoracic echo was then scheduled and overall cardiac function was deemed satisfactory and there was no significant tumor thrombus. The case was discussed at length with hepatobiliary surgery and at an MDM involving cardiothoracic surgery. It was decided that this gentleman would be suitable for a right radical nephrectomy with removal of an inferior vena cava and right atrium thrombus. He made a tremendous recovery and was discharged from hospital day 10 post op. The pulmonary nodules are still suspicious for pulmonary metastases and will be followed up with interval scans. Objective: The aim of this clinical audit is to evaluate the adequacy of diagnostic process, follow-up of patients with suspected DVT. The recommendations in the Nice guidelines; 'Venous thromboembolic diseases: the management of venous thromboembolic diseases and the role of thrombophilia testing' 1 will be used as comparison for best practice. Methods: A retrospective audit of the DVT referrals for the month of May 2013 was conducted. The way each patient was evaluated and followed up was recorded and data were tabulated in Microsoft Words: Mac 2011. Results: 30 patients were enrolled A history, physical examination, well's score and D-dimer were performed for all suspected DVT referrals. Out of 30-8 (26.7 %) had a likely two-level DVT well's score (C2) and the remaining 22 (73.3 %) had an unlikely two-level DVT well's score (B1). Among the group of 8 with likely Wells score-6 (20 %) had a raised D-dimer and they all had a Doppler ultrasound of the affected lower leg. 2 (6.67 %) of those ultrasounds were positive for DVT and 4 (13.3 %) were negative. Out of the 4 negative dopplers-3 patients were discharged with no follow-up and 1 was scheduled for review of symptoms within 1 week. Among the group of 22 with unlikely wells score-11 (36.7 %) had a raised D-dimer. Only 1 (3.33 %) out of this group of 11 had a lower leg ultrasound, which was negative and discharged with no further follow-up.

Introduction: Anticholinergic drugs are extensively used in mental health settings. However, clinical research and guidance on their use is scant. Their short-term adverse effects include constipation, dry mouth, blurred vision and tachycardia [1] . Their longer-term side effects include cognitive impairment, agitation and the initiation or worsening of tardive dyskinesia [1] . The World Health Organization recommends that anticholinergics should not be routinely prescribed for the treatment of extrapyramidal side effects in individuals on antipsychotics [2] . Their use should be short-term and restricted to individuals with significant extrapyramidal side effects, when dose reduction and switching strategies have proven ineffective, or when side effects are acute or severe [2] . Method: A sample of patients on depot antipsychotic medications attending an outpatient psychiatric service was retrospectively audited using medical charts. Standards were developed from several evidence-based sources [3] . We aimed to audit the number of anticholinergics prescribed per patient, the daily dose of anticholinergics prescribed, the duration of anticholinergic use and to establish if the long-term use of anticholinergics was being reviewed quarterly. Results: Eighty-one patients were audited (n = 81). Of the 81 patients on depot antipsychotics, 44 % were prescribed anticholinergic medications (n = 36). 66 % of those patients were prescribed Biperiden (n = 24) and the remaining 33 % were prescribed Procyclidine (n = 12). None of the patients were prescribed more than one anticholinergic medication. Furthermore, none of the patients were prescribed doses that exceeded the limits set out in the British National Formulary [1] . Of those prescribed anticholinergics, 31 % have been taking them for longer than 3 years (n = 11) and 17 % have been taking them for less than 1 year (n = 6). 17 % of the patients had their anticholinergic prescriptions reviewed in the 3 months prior to the audit (n = 6). Conclusion: The audit exposed a lack of regular review of anticholinergic medications and revealed that these drugs were frequently prescribed to patients on depot antipsychotic medication on a long-term basis.

It is caused by a number of different processes-underling infection, bone marrow involvement and tumour production of hematopoietic factors or tumour related leukocytosis. Tumour related Leukocytosis (TRL) is particularly prevalent in solid lung tumours. Here, I will describe a rare case of tumour related hyperleukocytosis (WCC [50,000), review the literature and discuss the prognostic indication and risks associated with the condition. Case: BM, a 62 year old male, presented to ED following a 1 month course of frequent visits to his GP for treatment of a chest infection. On referral to ED his community CXRs had progressed from an initial left basal consolidation to left lower lobe collapse with superimposed pleural effusion. Symptoms over the previous month were SOBOE, cough, night sweats and LHS chest pain. On presentation to ED he was admitted. CXR showed a complete opacification of the left hemithorax and his WCC was 48,000. He proceeded to have a CT thorax, which showed occlusion of the left mainstem bronchus and complete left lung collapse. A histopathological diagnosis of poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma was made. During his inpatient stay his WCC climbed as high as 110,000. He is for bronchial stenting and radiotherapy with possible future chemotherapy planned. Clinical significance: On review of the literature it quickly becomes apparent that TRL is a poor prognostic factor. In one study NSCLC associated with TRL was shown to have an even poorer prognosis than small cell lung cancer. As well as being a poor prognostic factor it is a significant risk for VTE, which these patient groups are already at extremely high risk for.

This quality improvement project has been conducted prospectively to investigate the current bleep patterns of interns on call in University Hospital Limerick (UHL) with a view to develop a future bleep policy for interns. The interns in UHL are provided with a questionnaire to record the various tasks they were bleeped by nurses on duty. A total of 856 bleeps were recorded from 37 on-call shifts over a period of 3 weeks. The data obtained is tabulated below. Patient care accounts for 34.00 % of bleeps with 29.44 % for clinical procedures. A very significant 36.56 % of bleeps were for administrative and clerical categories which may not be urgent. The limitation to this study is the potential overlap between categories and as non patient care categories are the foundation towards patient's outcome which might be equally urgent in some instances. Bleeps do cause interruptions and disruptions to intern's work and rest. Any inappropriate bleeps would ultimately result in reduction of quality of patient care. Therefore, an introduction to a Bleep Policy in UHL drawing from international guidelines and best practice [1] would be most relevant.

Aims and objective: In a GP practice: To identify all patients receiving diuretics for hypertension or heart failure and to measure percentage of these patients who have had electrolytes checked (1) in the last year or (2) in the last 6 months. A rate of 90 % is the acceptable target. Methods: Using the 'population analysis' function on Health One computer system in a GP practice, all patients receiving diuretic therapy were identified. All diuretic patients who had their electrolyte levels monitored (1) in the last 12 months and (2) in the last 6/12 were identified. Of the patients on diuretics who did not have their electrolytes measured, it was determined if there had been a missed opportunity i.e. a consultation where blood could have been taken and tested. It was also studied if there was any correlation with private/ public status and whether a patient had electrolytes monitored. Results and analysis: 200 patients of the practice were prescribed diuretics (so far 45 analysed) Implications: It is possible on the Health One system to flag patients who are due a blood test.

A 10-year-old boy with a history of prior abdominal surgeries presented to the ED around midnight with a 6 h history of abdominal pain and profuse bilious vomiting. He had passed a bowel movement that morning but had become obstipated in the past few hours. On examination, he appeared lethargic, his abdomen was distended and tender particularly in the periumbilical region. No rebound tenderness was observed. His vital signs were stable and laboratory investigations were normal. An abdominal radiograph in A&E demonstrated a prominent loop of small bowel in the central abdomen with an air fluid level. As the patient's past surgical history included an open appendectomy for a perforated appendix 16 months prior, and more recently an umbilical hernia repair, the clinical picture was suggestive of a mechanical SBO due to adhesions. However, the PFA also revealed a radiopaque density projected over the midline. Following a day of observation, and non-resolving symptoms, a laparotomy was performed with a finding of multiple small magnetic beads adhering adjacent loops of distal ileum via a sealed local perforation. The involved segment was resected (approximately 10 cm) and the small bowel was joined with a primary hand-sewn anastomosis. The postoperative period was uneventful with a repeat PFA confirming removal of all foreign bodies.

This was on a background of primary CNS lymphoma diagnosed 2 years prior, treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, causing panhypopituitarism and cognitive difficulties. Medications included desmopressin, hydrocortisone, levothyroxine, risperidone and levetiracetam. Physical exam, including neurological and cranial nerve exam, was normal. Serum analysis revealed serum sodium of 108 mmol/L, serum osmolality of 227 mosmol/kg and spot urinary sodium of 10 mmol/L. The patient was admitted to ICU for monitoring. Desmopressin was held and urinary output measured, with substitution of urinary losses with IV 5 % dextrose. Subsequently, sodium level was seen to rise too quickly and desmopressin was re-introduced Inpatient stay was complicated by a UTI requiring antibiotics and a stress dose of hydrocortisone. In addition, she developed hypernatraemia, with sodium climbing from 146 to 163mmol/L over 24 h, requiring IV 5 % dextrose. Discussion: This case deals with a multifactorial cause of hyponatraemia, and also stresses the complexities of managing sodium. Hyponatraemia is categorised into hypervolaemic, hypovolaemic and euvolaemic hyponatraemia. Pseudohyponatraemia must be excluded and a low serum osmolality demonstrated. Assessment of urinary sodium loss and urinary volume is important in categorising different causes of hyponatraemia. Correction of hyponatraemia must be slow, at a rate of B0.5 mmol/L/h, to avoid osmotic demyelination syndrome. This case represents an interesting mixed picture, in which the predominant cause appeared to be excess water intake, with low urinary sodium. However, this was confounded by the inability to regulate intrinsic ADH, due to ADH deficiency, and the continued administration of extrinsic ADH, despite falling serum osmolality. In addition hypocortisolism may have contributed to the low sodium, as measured serum cortisol was low. This case also demonstrates the difficulty in managing sodium in adipsic diabetes insipidus.

Past medical history: She had a history of epilepsy, depression secondary to child sexual abuse, chronic pain and reportedly had a diagnosis of Crohn's disease. She had also suffered from severe constipation, and had normal manometry, defecating proctography and transit studies. Constipation was likely caused by anismus secondary to the history of abuse. She underwent partial colectomy and formation of colostomy. She had an emergency laparotomy for bowel necrosis secondary to obstruction at the colostomy site. Post-op she developed life threatening sepsis, ARDS and ARF. She was lost to follow-up until this admission. Hospital course: She was admitted, given IV antibiotics and brought to theatre for debridement of the area and application of a VAC dressing. Biopsies were taken of the area as it was suspected that this was pyoderma gangrenosum secondary to Crohn's disease. She was treated systemically with steroids and cyclosporine. Once her full history was known the diagnosis of Crohn's was revised and she was tapered off immunosuppression. The excoriation improved with conservative management and she was discharged home after a prolonged hospital stay. Discussion: This lady suffered life-threatening complications from surgery for symptomatic relief, when the American Society of Colorectal Surgeons guidelines on the management of constipation don't include anismus as an indication for surgery [1] .Therefore S172 Ir J Med Sci (2014) 183 (Suppl 4):S119-S199", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2092, "end": 2095, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Outcomes for Emergency Laparotomies in a Regional Hospital"}, {"text": "although it is easy in hindsight to say that she should have been managed conservatively this case emphasizes the importance of careful balancing of the potential benefits and risks of surgery for symptomatic relief.

Ward patients in both male and separate female wards were assessed in order to prevent gender bias.

One hundred consecutive accident and emergency department attendees and twenty-five male ward patients as well as 25 Upon reviewing charts of the admitted ward patients 6 out of 50 (12 %) patients were confirmed diabetics and of the 6 only 3 (50 %) confirmed diabetics had their blood glucose levels done upon admission.

Unfortunately A&E patients were not able to be confirmed for diabetic status due to the fact only attendee lists were available for assessment. Conclusion: In conclusion preliminary data obtained from this audit shows that only a small amount of the total hospital population is being initially screened for diabetes upon admission or within the first 24 h of admission. Routine screening and early detection of diabetes in a hospital setting can help prevent further progression of diabetes in those undiagnosed, limit the overall complications patients face in the midst of diabetes, as well as help tailor patient treatment within a hospital setting for those with diabetes. The overall all cost-effectiveness of diabetic screening is fairly small compared to the total medical costs and decreased quality of life that occurs with diabetic complications. Although community screening for diabetes is not recommended it may however be beneficial in a hospital setting where patients are presenting with symptomatic features that could be associated with diabetes. Introduction: Infective endocarditis is a well-known clinical entity that still commonly presents with a myriad of complications. Presentations are classified into acute or subacute. The heterogeneity of this clinical identity often causes misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis, which leads to an increase in mortality and morbidity. Pre-existing congenital valve lesions or structural heart disease predisposes the occurrence of this condition. This case report is on a 46-year-old male who presented with joint pains and fever and was subsequently found to have Staphylococcus aureus infected endocarditis, further complicated by complete heart block due to aortic root abscess. Case presentation: A 46 year old male with a background history of psoriasis and coeliac disease was admitted on second presentation, 2 days post discharge from A&E with ongoing symptoms of multiple joint pains, general malaise, reduced appetite, fevers and rigors. He reported no weight loss, headache, cough, abdominal pain or urinary symptoms and denied any recent holidays or infectious contacts. He is a non-smoker but drinks 20-30 units of alcohol per week. On admission, vital signs recorded a temperature of 37.3\u00b0C 2 h post Paracetamol, BP 139/73 mmHg, HR 90 bpm and RR 18/min.

It is believed to be caused by a defect in calcium metabolism which is confined to the lungs. PAM is characterised by a striking and truly unique appearance on chest radiograph caused by calcific deposits in the alveolar spaces. No effective treatment has been evolved as yet and the disease is fatal. Case: A 27-year-old man was admitted under orthopaedic care for treatment of a right sided antecubital fossa abscess. Routine chest radiograph on admission revealed diffuse, symmetric, reticular-nodular shadowing bilaterally, predominantly in the mid zones. Effusions, consolidation, cardiomegaly and adenopathy were absent. The patient reported a history of feeling ''caught'' in the chest on exertion and following large meals. He also mentioned frequent appointments with respiratory physicians in Galway. A perusal of the patient's notes revealed abnormal lung function tests with 42 % response to bronchodilators and unremarkable bronchoscopy. The patients elbow was assessed and he received intravenous antibiotic therapy for 3 days prior to discharge on an oral regimen as treatment of his abscess. He continues to be seen by respiratory physicians in Galway on an outpatient basis. Discussion: There is no specific treatment of PAM. Allendronate Sodium has been documented as a method of providing symptomatic relief but has not reversed chest radiograph findings. Corticosteroids and bronchopulmonary lavage have no effect. Eventually respiratory failure and cor pulmonale supervene with ominous consequence. Substantial research is required to discover an absolute cure of this rare life-threatening disorder. Birt-Hogg-Dub\u00e9 Syndrome (BHDS) is a rare autosomal-dominant inherited disorder. It results from a germline mutation of the FLCN gene, which codes for folliculin, a tumour suppressor protein. BHDS is characterised by a triad of skin fibrofolliculomas, multiple lungs cysts and malignant renal tumours. Since the sentinel paper describing BHDS in 1977 there have been multiple cases of various tumours, both malignant and benign associated with BHDS.

His background was significant for Swyer-James Syndrome, an underdeveloped left pulmonary vasculature, with a hypoplastic left lung. In addition, he had anti-thrombin III deficiency, with a history of multiple pulmonary emboli and was on lifelong warfarin. Initial CT revealed a small diverticular abscess and he was treated conservatively with antibiotics. However, following apparently successful treatment and discharge from hospital, he represented with abdominal pain and developed signs of small bowel obstruction. CT revealed a large diverticular abscess arising from the sigmoid colon with small bowel obstruction due to extrinsic compression by the abscess. A work up for surgery included pulmonary function tests, which displayed an interesting mixed restrictive and obstructive pattern; Our patient also had a 15 pack year history of smoking. Given the complexity of his respiratory disease, a conservative approach was taken as he was felt to be an extremely high risk surgical candidate. His imaging was reviewed at a multidisciplinary conference, and a decision was made to radiologically drain his collection. This resulted in resolution of his SBO slowly over the next week and the drain was removed. Repeat CT the following week showed complete resolution of the SBO and of the abscess. Inflammatory markers returned to normal, antibiotics were stopped and the patient was discharged home after a 23 day stay in hospital. Conclusion: Decision making in surgical patients is increasingly complex. This case highlights the management dilemmas presented by patients with complex medical co-morbidities and the need for a multidisciplinary approach. Discussion: This case outlines four major conditions: Swyer James Syndrome, Antithrombin III deficiency, complicated diverticular disease and small bowel obstruction. Swyer-James Syndrome occurs in\\0.01 % of patients and is usually the result of recurrent childhood infections resulting in hypoplastic lung [2] . Anti-thrombin III deficiency and other hereditary thrombophilias are considered to have a higher risk of venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism, as exhibited by this case.

Background: Arterial Blood Gas analysis is one of the most commonly performed and important diagnostic tests performed in the hospital. If the FiO 2 is not recorded, it is impossible to gauge the patients oxygen status and to identify hypoxic patients. Aims: Not recording the patient's FiO 2 appears to be common and we sought to establish the scale of the problem. Methods: We looked at the charts of 30 medical and surgical patients and recorded whether or not the FiO 2 was recorded at the time of the ABG. We noted whether any comment on the ABG was made and if any change in management took place as a result. Results: We had a sample size of 30. Only 53 % of ABG's we looked at noted the FiO 2 . In the majority of cases no interpretation of the ABG was documented with only 43 % of ABG's having an accompanying note explaining the ABG's significance. In 40 % of cases, no documented change in took place as a result of the ABG. Conclusions: It is essential to record the FiO 2 of the patient when the ABG is performed in order to accurately interpret the ABG. This is something frequently neglected and in only a minority of cases is an interpretation of the ABG recorded. This suggests that ABG's may not be being interpreted correctly with hypoxic patients possibly not being identified.

The signs and symptoms of complications related to OPLL are non-specific and varied. The size of the spinal canal is a factor that contributes to the neurologic deficits associated with cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL). Case description: A 75-year-old female presented with radicular pain which had persisted following a knee replacement and was treated with steroid injection. 3 years later she presented with upper and lower limb weakness which had become progressively worse during the previous 4-6 weeks. When she presented she could no longer walk independently and was using a wheelchair for mobility. She was very ataxic with a wide based gait on attempted walking. She was hyperreflexic with a positive Hoffmans sign bilaterally. She had profound grade 3 weakness in her right lower limb and grade 4 throughout the remainder of her limbs. She had significant loss of ADLs on presentation and required a carer. She was admitted for investigation.

Discussion: Cervical myelopathy due to OPLL is most commonly seen in middle aged males of Asian extraction and is rarely seen in elderly Caucasian females. The normal cervical canal measures 17 mm in anterior/posterior diameter. Absolute stenosis defines a canal of 10 mm or less. The patient in this case had marked spinal stenosis with a spinal canal measurement of 9 mm. Following her initial presentation with non-specific radicular symptoms, her symptoms progressed rapidly and over a short period rendered her wheelchair bound and requiring a carer. This case demonstrates how surgical intervention in these patients can result in a marked change in quality of life and in this patient's case led to restoration of independent walking and living. Background: Bowel management is an important concern for individuals with myelomeningocele and for their families. Peristeen is a new device shown in previous studies to be an effective method of treatment of neurogenic bowel dysfunction (NBD) with ease of use and improved independence. However, we wanted to evaluate Peristeen in our own experience in Cork University Hospital (CUH) because of poor verbal feedback from our patients. Aims: The aim was to assess if Peristeen, in the opinion of the patient and their carers, is effective, reduces symptoms and time spent on bowel management and improves quality of life and independence compared to their previous bowel management method. Adverse events were also evaluated. Methods: 15 patients fitted the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A retrospective questionnaire was posted to these families.

Across all malignancies, family history is a strong predictor of increased risk. It is appreciated that identification of individuals at increased risk is an essential component of cancer care. GPs are commonly asked by patients to quantify risk, and are well positioned to identify the population at increased risk. Objective: To determine whether family history of cancer is being identified in general practice. Method: A retrospective audit on patients presenting with breast symptoms over a 5-year period. Outcomes measured: The clinical variables ascertained included; date of birth, risk factors for breast cancer, family history of breast, ovarian or colorectal cancer and referral to tertiary services. Results: Eighty-eight women presented with breast symptoms. Fortyone percent (thirty-six/eighty-eight) had no documentation of family history. A positive family history for breast cancer was observed in twenty-three percent (twenty/eighty-eight), the affected relative was identified in each case but age of diagnosis was not recorded in fifteen percent (three/twenty). Ten percent (two/twenty) of affected families also had a history of colorectal cancer. There was no family history of breast cancer in thirty-six percent (thirty-two/eighty-eight), but none of these records identified whether a history of ovarian or colorectal cancer had been inquired about. Referral to tertiary breast services was made in ninety-seven percent (eighty-five/eighty-eight). Fifteen percent (thirteen/eighty-eight) satisfied the national guidelines for genetic testing referral. Conclusions: Greater awareness of National Referral Guidelines and efficient recording strategies need to be developed to encourage GPs to obtain an accurate family history within the time constraints of a consultation. Backgrounds and aims: Accurate data collection is imperative in modern medical practice. HIPE (Hospital Inpatient Enquiry Scheme) is routine dataset that collects data on discharges and deaths from hospitals in Ireland [1] . This study assesses the reliability of using HIPE for monitoring trends of lower extremity amputations (LEA) in patients with and without diabetes. Methods: This study was designed as a concordance study between two data sources-HIPE and medical records. To determine the level of agreement for LEA, HIPE records were compared to theatre log books. This was done in nine hospitals in Munster for the years 2008-2009. For diabetes, HIPE records were compared to laboratory results. This was done in the four largest hospitals in the study area, for the first 200 patients discharged in December 2010. Results: When looking at LEA's, 216 LEA procedures were recorded in both HIPE and the theatre log books. Sixteen LEA's were recorded in the log book alone and 25 LEA's in HIPE alone. The proportion of positive agreement was 0.91 (95 % CI 0.88-0.94), When looking at diabetes, 49 patients had diabetes according to both data sources and 716 were not diabetic. Two patients had diabetes as per HIPE alone and 18 patients had diabetes as per laboratory results alone. The proportion of positive agreement was 0.83 (95 % CI 0.76-0.9) and the kappa statistic was 0.82 (95 % CI 0.75-0.89). Conclusions: We detected reasonably high levels of agreement between HIPE and medical records and we suggest that HIPE is a suitable data source for monitoring lower extremity amputations in patients with and without diabetes.

Our data showed that a significant proportion of our cohort presented with metastatic disease (28/114, 24.6 %), with only one case of metastatic disease undergoing resective surgery. The most common site of metastases was the liver (71.4 %), with numerous cases of omental metastases and peritoneal carcinomatosis.

The average total cholesterol was 4.56 mM and LDL 2.18 mM. Smokers compiled 63.16 % (n = 12). lesion was identified in all patients; an LAD lesion in 47.37 % (n = 9), an RCA or PLV lesion in 31.58 % (n = 6) and an LCx or OM in 21.05 % (n = 4) lesion. One patient had known CAD and previous PCI, both stents were patent, and a new lesion identified in the LCx. Four patients had non-obstructive disease identified in the two or more vessels at time of angiography. All patients underwent angioplasty and placement of a drug eluting stent. All patients were seen at a 1 year follow-up. No patients were re admitted with CAD during this time. Conclusion: Although a small study, it does highlight a number of CVD risk factors that were potentially targets for modification prior to presentation.

Case description: A 53-year-old female presented with crampy abdominal pain, bloating and loose bowel motions with a background history of ileocaecectomy in 2007 for Crohn's Disease. Physical examination was normal with laboratory parameters unremarkable. Colonoscopy demonstrated an anastomotic ileal stricture, biopsy of which confirmed chronic inflammation. Magnetic Resonance Enterography confirmed the stricture proximal to ileocolic anastomosis. Conservative management utilizing prednisolone, Immunomodulators and biologics conferred no benefit. Repeat colonoscopy confirmed a fixed fibrous stricture not amenable to balloon dilatation. Following multi disciplinary meeting discussion, with consciousness of previous laparotomy, a laparoscopic resection of 11 cm in region of ileocolic anastomosis was performed. Histopathological assessment disclosed anastomotic ulceration with no transmural inflammation or active ileocolitis. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated endothelial cells infiltrated by cytomegalovirus. Following Infectious Disease consultatation, Vanganciclovir was administered with steroid tapering.Discussion: Cytomegalovirus infection involving the gastro-intestinal tract is exacerbated in inflammatory bowel disease, most especially those who develop immunosuppression as a consequence of steroid dependence.

An Audit on Insulin Pump Therapy Use at an Irish Teaching Hospital Cotter TG, Dinneen SF, Bell M, Dunne F, Finucane FM, O'Brien T Department of Endocrinology, Galway University Hospital, Galway; Mater Misericordiae Hospital; NUI Galway and UCD Intern Training Network Background: There were 33 adult patients on insulin pump therapy at Galway University Hospital's (GUH) Diabetes Centre at the time of this audit. The NICE Guidelines recommend pump therapy as a treatment option for adults with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) provided their gycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) has remained high (C69 mmol/L) on Multiple Daily Insulin (MDI) therapy. Local protocol generally requires 6 months of Diet Adjusted For Normal Eating (DAFNE) participation before consideration of pump therapy. Objectives: Identify adults with T1DM on MDI therapy with HbA1c C69 mmol/L and assess if insulin pump therapy has been considered as a treatment option. Methods: A retrospective review of medical records was conducted on the DIAMOND Clinical Information System of adult patients with T1DM who have attended the Diabetes Centre from June 2011 to June 2013. Patients on MDI and with HbA1c C69 mmol/L were identified. Their records were then examined along with the current pump waiting list. Results: 797 patients were eligible for inclusion. 377/797(47 %) patients had HbA1c C69 mmol/L. Of these, 15 were already on pump therapy while a further 15 were on premixed or modified regimens, resulting in 347/797 (43.5 %) eligible candidates. 33/347 (10 %) of these candidates had reference to insulin pump therapy in notes or were on the waiting list. Of the 314/347 candidates who had no documentation, 84/314 (27 %) had documentation of over 6 months of DAFNE.Conclusion: There was limited compliance with the NICE guidelines-it is likely that this reflects resource constraints. This problem has resulted in a highly selective pump usage strategy with device availability only for those who were likely to benefit maximally. This audit highlights the importance of continued investment in insulin pump therapy.

General Practice is undoubtedly a stressful job. Strategies should be employed to enhance and maintain mental health in order to prevent psychological distress. One such strategy is Mindfulness based practices. Aim: To explore where Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction practices might fit within a range of strategies used by General Practitioners in order to maintain their mental health. Methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive study was carried out using a self-complete questionnaire, which was piloted prior to distribution. 200 GPs from the HSE South region were selected at random using a random number generator. Results: \u2022 128 GPs responded yielding a response rate of 64 % \u2022 20 % (n = 26) of respondents attended a Mindfulness course or seminar. \u2022 GPs in Urban practices were significantly more likely to have attended a Mindfulness course than those in rural or mixed practices respectively (42.1 vs. 9.8 vs. 20.6 %, p = 0.015). \u2022 9 % (n = 11) of the GPs stated that they use Mindfulness meditation as their most frequent strategy to maintain their mental health. \u2022 77 % (n = 99) of GPs expressed an interest in attending a Mindfulness course, of which 15 % (n = 20) were ''very interested''. \u2022 Females were significantly more aware of the meaning of Mindfulness than males (79.5 vs. 49.4 %, p = 0.003).

Camb J Sonography in Thoraco-Abdominal Junctional Zone Injuries. Glisson's Capsule and the IVC Sign Indicating Infra-Diaphragmatic Prior Cullivan SK, O'Callaghan ME, O'Connor G, Breslin T, Moughty A, McInerney J, Brazil E Department of Emergency Medicine, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Eccles Street, Dublin 7; UCD Intern Training Network Background: Focussed assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) is a critical investigation utilized by Emergency Physicians to target life saving interventions. In the context of abdominal trauma, black anechoic collections represent intra-peritoneal fluid. Parenchymal injuries can be suggested by heterogeneous echogenicity, however recognition of these subtleties is widely recognised to be challenging. Despite these difficulties, the ability to detect these injuries can significantly impact on clinical decision making in time critical situations. This case report illustrates these issues. Methods: A case report of penetrating injury to the thoraco-abdominal junctional zone Results: A 56-year-old gentleman presented to the Emergency Department with a penetrating injury to the right lateral inferior chest wall. Resuscitative efforts included chest drain insertion for an open pneumothorax, and femoral line placement to address refractory Accumulative figure based on the hospitals pricing for one public surgical bed per night hypotension.FAST imaging demonstrated small anechoic perihepatic and peri-splenic collections. In particular the small collection around Glisson's capsule was considered to be an unlikely explanation for this patient's profound refractory hypotension. Emergency thoracotomy was expedited for a clinical massive haemothorax. Intraoperatively, right diaphragmatic and intra-abdominal inferior vena caval (IVC) lacerations were visualised, prompting rapid follow-on laparotomy. Despite these measures this gentleman succumbed to his injuries. In retrospect the Glisson's capsule fluid and echogenicity surrounding the IVC represent the definite sonographic hallmarks of this rare injury pattern. Conclusion: Thoraco-abdominal junctional injuries, by their nature, present significant management challenges. However awareness of the imaging nuances of the supra-and infra-diaphragmatic injury patterns allows more focussed clinical decision making in such cases.Cullivan SK, O'Callaghan ME, O'Connor G, Breslin T, Moughty A, McInerney J, Brazil E Department of Emergency Medicine; Department of Radiology, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Eccles Street, Dublin 7; UCD Intern Training Network", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF30": {"text": "Clinical parametersDiscussion: Compliance with hospital guidelines for antimicrobial coverage is suboptimal (26.7 %).

HAA may be a preventable process. Aims: The aims of this study are to (1) quantify the amount of DBL from phlebotomy, (2) observe any changes in haemoglobin levels, (3) examine whether changes in Haemoglobin and DBL are related and (4) examine if HAA is occurring in Mercy University Hospital (MUH). Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 72 patients who presented with acute myocardial infarction or angina pectoris to the MUH in 2011. The volume of DBL per patient was calculated using the number and volume per blood bottle used. Haemoglobin on admission and the nadir haemoglobin were compared to determine if any changes took place. Results: The median (IQR) volume of DBL was 52.55 (44.4-76.44) ml. One patient developed severe anaemia and 18 (75 %) developed moderate anaemia (Beutler and Waalen's criteria[2]). Nineteen patients anaemic on admission had a further decrease in haemoglobin. Discussion: DBL is associated with a clinically significant decrease in haemoglobin in a proportion of patients. Modifying the practices of phlebotomy to minimise excessive DBL may improve outcomes.Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome: A Multisystemic DiseaseBrady J, Murphy CL, Donnelly S Department of Rheumatology, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Eccles Street, Dublin 7; UCD Intern Training Network", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF32": {"text": "Methods: A retrospective review of three cases of primary polydipsia presenting to the Adelaide and Meath Hospital Dublin, Incorporating the National Children's Hospital was performed. Data pertaining to patient details, growth parameters, presenting symptoms, laboratory studies, treatment and outcome was gathered. Results: Our cohort included two male and one female patient. Age ranged from 11 months to 3 years. Average cordial intake was 2.3 L per day. Common presenting features included polyuria (3/3), polydispsia (3/3), reduced appetite (2/3) and disturbed sleep (2/3) secondary to thirst. Additionally, diurnal eneuresis (1/3) and elevated BMI (1/3) were also reported. Initial investigations showed normal serum sodium, low urine osmolality (mean 127 mOsm/kg, range 79-202 mOsm/kg) and normal serum osmolality (mean 288 mOsm/ kg) in all cases. There was raised creatinine in two cases (mean elevation 5.5 lmol/L). In two cases, replacement of cordials with free water for 24 h resulted in appropriate urinary concentration (urine osmolality [600 mOsm/kg). In one case, a water deprivation test was used to exclude diabetes insipidus (urine osmolality was 752 mOsm/ kg after 16 h). Regarding management, reduction or complete omission of cordials resulted in complete resolution of polyuria, and polydipsia. Conclusion: Habit drinking with excessive intake of cordials is a common cause of polyuria and polydipsia in the paediatric population and has predictable negative health effects. Basic laboratory evaluation should include serum urea, creatinine, electrolytes, glucose and urine and blood osmolality in order to exclude organic causes. Once diagnosed, habit drinking is usually managed successfully with reduction or complete omission of cordials from the diet.References: 1.

Wexford; TCD Intern Training Network Aortitis is inflammation of the aortic wall, often occuring in the context of systemic vasculitis. Here we present a case of a 73-year-old gentleman who presented with abdominal pain and weight loss. Initial investigations revealed pancreatic abnormalities and a raised CA 19.9. PET-CT was performed to investigate these pancreatic findings, but resulted in a diagnosis of aortitis. This case highlights the utility of PET-CT in the diagnosis of abdominal aortitis and the need to consider aortitis as a differential in patients with abdominal pain with a history of vasculitis.

There is significant morbidity and mortality associated and studies have shown in hospital mortality can be as high as 16.5 %[1]. However, there remains a significant lack of data regarding the outcomes of patients undergoing emergency Laparotomies[2]. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted reviewing the list of all emergency laparotomies carried out in a peripheral hospital within a 12-month period. The list was obtained from the medical records and a pro-forma was established including co-morbidities, investigations prior to surgery, deterioration in renal function and complications. The standard of care was compared to national and international standards. Results: 60 emergency laparotomies were performed in 2012 of which 39 charts were attainable. Charts were unavailable due to flood damage and ongoing clinics off site. The mean age of patients was 65 and the average co-morbidities was 3.8. 69.2 % of patients went to ICU post op and the mean duration of stay there was 5.2 days. There was a 12.8 % in hospital mortality rate and a 15.4 % 30 day mortality rate. Conclusion: The in hospital mortality rate was less than expected, however, the 30 day mortality was in line with available literature.

Out-of-hours, 6 Interns cover 21-24 wards until midnight, reducing to 4 Interns until 9 a.m. Without an operational on-call bleep policy, Interns can face a large volume of tasks in addition to providing essential emergency care. Aims: This ongoing audit, due to cease on December 24th, aims to quantify the number of Intern on-call requests and categorize these as appropriate or inappropriate. This coincides with the draft of an oncall bleep policy for Beaumont Hospital due for implementation on January 1st, 2014. A 4-week follow up audit is planned for February 2014. Methods: On-call tasks were recorded on hard copy lists which were collected at shift end for review. Tasks were compared directly with those deemed appropriate in existing bleep policies in both HSE and NHS hospitals. Interns completed a questionnaire to quantify the total number of bleeps received in a shift and the total hours rest obtained to quantify the volume of work required during a shift.Results: In total, 64.1 % (Medical) and 78.4 % (Surgical) of ward task data was collected. From these 419 medical and 856 surgical oncall tasks were reviewed with 56.5 % (n = 237) and 45.9 % (n = 393) being classed as inappropriate. Interns reported an average of 15-20 bleeps and 1-3 h sleep in a 24-h period. 28 % of interns reported no sleep and 40.6 % said [50 % of calls were inappropriate. Conclusions: In total, 49.4 % (n = 630) of tasks were classed as inappropriate. A completed audit will highlight the need for a local bleep policy to protect Interns rest and provide appropriate out-ofhours care.

Magnetic resonance imaging showed findings of bilateral cerebello-pontine angle meningiomas. Audiometry showed she has sensorineural hearing loss affecting the left side greater than right side. The presentation is consistent with a clinical diagnosis of Neurofibromatosis Type II (NF2) with a differential diagnosis of sporadic multiple meningiomas. Multiple meningiomas are defined as 2 spatially separated meningiomas that occur in absence of neurofibromatosis or vestibular schwannoma[1]. NF2 is a genetic disease caused by mutations of the Merlin gene that results in symmetric, non-malignant brain tumours. Clinical diagnosis requires bilateral eighth nerve masses visualized on MRI, or a first-degree relative with documented NF2 for an individual with a unilateral eighth nerve mass, or a first-degree relative with documented NF2 for an individual with at least 2 of the following findings: meningioma, glioma, schwannoma, or juvenile cataract[2]. Our treatment plan involves surgical resection of the largest tumor initially with preservation of cochlear nerve function. With the genetic implications of NF Type II, her daughter will be tested for similar tumour manifestations with MRI.References: 1. Granger A, Sainsbury R, Wilkinson T (20000 Macfarlane.

Low energy diets (LEDs) have been shown to induce significant weight loss [1] . Several types are available, but a relatively inexpensive and straightforward regime based on meal replacement with semi-skimmed milk has shown therapeutic promise, within the context of an intensive weight-management programme (IWMP) incorporating lifestyle change and behaviour modification [2, 3] .We sought to determine the efficacy of this LED in patients attending the Bariatric Medicine Clinic at GUH, and the efficacy of the milk-based diet in changing outcomes relevant to specific patient subgroups, i.e. HbA1c in severely obese patients with Type 2 Diabetes.Our cohort consists of patients who are currently enrolled in a 24-week IWMP, and have completed the initial 8-week weight-loss phase whereby a milk-based liquid diet is prescribed. This consists of *2.5 L/day of semi-skimmed milk, with additional sodium, vitamin, mineral and fibre supplementation, equating to *1,200 kcal/day. 18 patients (10 female) of which 10 had Type 2 Diabetes, completed the 8-week weight-loss phase. Initially, mean weight was 147.5 \u00b1 28.1 kg, mean BMI 54.3 \u00b1 7.6kg m 2 , mean age was 52 (range 34-66) years and HbA1c was 65.8 \u00b1 21.6 mmol/mol in the diabetic subgroup. After the intervention, mean weight was 130.8 \u00b1 26.7 kg, mean BMI 48.1 \u00b1 7.3kg m 2 , and mean HbA1c 57.8 \u00b1 15.4 mmol/mol, with a mean weight loss of 16.6 \u00b1 4.4 kg.This LED is an effective weight-loss tool and may serve as a useful adjunct or in some cases as an alternative to bariatric surgery in the severely obese, while also contributing to significant improvements in metabolic outcomes such as HbA1c. Background: Tobacco use is the single most preventable cause of death in the world and is a habit which, for many, develops during adolescence. The WHO states tobacco is thought to kill 5.4 million people per annum, a figure expected to rise to 8 million by 2030, unless there is concerted international action on tobacco control. Aims: (1) To establish the main interventions being used to help prevent adolescents from smoking, or to help them cease smoking. (2) To assess Dublin school-students' attitudes towards smoking and the effectiveness of some of the interventions employed currently. Method: A survey compiled was distributed to schools and G.P. practices. We surveyed 478 school going adolescents. Results: The largest percentage of adolescents who smoked was aged between 16 and 17 years. This age bracket also contained the largest amount of adolescents who had once been smokers but had now given up. Amongst other interesting findings, we ellucidated experimentation, boredom, mood enhancement and creation of the right image were the main reasons cited for beginning smoking.Conclusion: The impacts of many of smoking interventions were reviewed which highlighted the importance of education on the negative health implications of smoking in adolescents to prevent initiation of this habit in those under 19. Peer support groups should be more widely available to those who do smoke as it was found to be the most effective intervention. It has been shown that interventions based on a cognitive behavioural approach are most likely to be successful.Introduction: Well-differentiated papillary mesothelioma (WDPM) is a rare epithelioid mesothelioma of uncertain aetiology, primarily of women of reproductive age. It is usually an incidental finding involving the peritoneum, pleura, pericardium or tunica vaginalis, with occurrence at multiple sites reported. Treatment options include observation, local resection, cytoreductive surgery, and intravenous or intraperitoneal chemotherapy. WDPM is a tumour of low malignant potential, with reported outcomes from stable disease without intervention, to rare malignant transformation. Introduction: Acute compartment syndrome is a neurovascular emergency. It occurs when tissue pressure within a closed muscle compartment exceeds the perfusion pressure resulting in muscle and nerve ischemia. It is commonly associated with traumatic events, such as crush injuries or fractures but may also occur after reperfusion of vascular occlusion and an ischaemic period within a limb. Consequences of neglected compartment syndrome include, irreversibleThe patient was readmitted electively for excision of the exostosis. Following preservation of the vessels of the popliteal fossa, the exostosis was excised. Histological reports indicated an osteochondroma. Therapeutic low molecular weight heparin was discontinued 6 weeks post-operatively and venous thrombosis has not reoccurred.An exostosis, also known as osteochondroma, is a cartilage capped lesion. If solitary, they represent low malignant potential and unless symptomatic, they are rarely excised. When excised, they have a 5 % risk of recurrence. Background: Traffic medicine aims at reducing injury and deaths due to traffic accidents. In 2013, the Medical Fitness to Drive Guidelines, Sl\u00e1inte agus Tiom\u00e1int [1] , were published by the Irish Road Safety Authority (RSA). These guidelines help doctors to assess a patient's driving fitness. Identifying and warning patients who are potentially unfit to drive has previously been shown to decrease trauma from road accidents [2] . Aims: This audit aimed to investigate whether doctors were aware of/ had read the guidelines. A questionnaire aimed to assess knowledge of information and recommendations contained in the guidelines. Methods: A representative majority of the doctors from Saint Vincent's Hospital, Fairview were selected. 5 consultants, and 6 NCHDs completed a 30 item questionnaire, containing both open-ended and closed-ended questions. The questions were adapted from the guidelines, and focussed on medications which affect driving. Results: 82 % of doctors had heard of the guidelines, however only 55 % had read them. Only 27 % could state the year the guidelines were published. The mean questionnaire score for a NCHD was 58 %, while for a consultant was 45 %. Those who had previously read the guidelines scored higher than those who had not. There were certain questions which were consistently poorly answered. Conclusion: More should be done to increase awareness of the Medical Fitness to Drive Guidelines. A letter with recommendations was written to the RSA. A summary of the important guidelines was compiled, which was distributed to hospital doctors, to increase their knowledge related to medications which affect driving. to the respiratory clinic with worsening dry cough and exertional dyspnoea. The patient was known to haematology regarding a coagulopathy first noted at the age of 14, marked by frequent epistaxis and which required multiple blood transfusions following minor surgical or dental procedures. Following referral for genetic testing and electron microscopy studies of whole blood, which showed an absence of platelet-dense (PD) bodies, Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome Type 1 was diagnosed. Monitoring for subsequent pulmonary fibrosis by pulmonary function testing and HRCT thorax was initiated. The patient has since been commenced on pirfenidone following documented deterioration. The Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome is a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive disorders defined by a storage pool deficiency of platelets, and characterised by tyrosinase-positive oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding diathesis, and systemic complications associated to lysosomal dysfunction, such as pulmonary fibrosis and granulomatous colitis [1] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 237, "end": 240, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 536, "end": 539, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 540, "end": 542, "text": "3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2275, "end": 2278, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5142, "end": 5145, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5407, "end": 5410, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7655, "end": 7658, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "annex"}, {"text": "Eight known HPS subtypes exist, the majority of which present with the same clinical phenotype, albeit varying degrees of severity. Over three-quarters of patients with HPS die of causes directly related to the syndrome. Life expectancy is between 30 and 50 years of age [1, 2] .HPS-1 and HPS-4 carry the most severe prognosis, since these subtypes are associated with the development of pulmonary fibrosis. This is attributed to accumulation of a ceroid-like substance in lysosomes of a variety of tissues. While pirfenidone may slow the progression of pulmonary fibrosis in some HPS patients, lung transplantation is the only definitive treatment at present. Steroid therapy is not effective [1, 3] . Background: In order to aid recognition of changes in a patient's state the National Early Warning Score (EWS) system was recently introduced in Ireland. The EWS system allows the calculation of a patient's risk of serious deterioration using a number of specific parameters.Aims: The purpose of this study was to conduct interviews with interns, Non-consultant hospital doctors (NCHDs), and nurses in order to obtain information on attitudes to the EWS system. Methods: A total of 30 semi-structured interviews were performed with 18 interns, 2 NCHDs, and 10 nurses.Results: It was recognised that the EWS system was useful in identifying and monitoring sick patients, and particularly helpful in empowering nurses to encourage a doctor to evaluate a patient. As such, the nurses generally believed that the EWS system positively impacted communication between nurses and interns. However, there was still reticence on the part of the nurses to call more senior doctors even when required. Not all of the interns agreed that the EWS system necessarily improved communication between interns and nurses. It was suggested that the EWS system can negatively impact clinical judgement and flexibility. It was also agreed by interns and nurses that the EWS system increases the workload of interns.Conclusions: The EWS system would appear to have a positive impact on patient care. However, there is a need to encourage nurses to contact senior doctors as required, and consideration should be given to the effect the EWS system is having on the workload of interns.

Aims: The value of preoperative staging chest CT in colorectal cancer remains controversial [1] . We looked at the effect of indeterminate pulmonary nodules in the staging of colorectal cancer and the effect it had upon patient outcome. The progression of pulmonary nodules from initial CT Thorax, Abdomen and Pelvis (CT-TAP) was also documented.Methods: This is a 12 month retrospective study in a single centre. Patients were identified using the surgical multidisciplinary team lists and patient details were populated using electronic patient records and PACS system. CT-scans were reviewed to identify patients in which indeterminate lung nodules (IPN's) had been reported on initial staging CT-scan. The TNM stage of these patients was recorded together with follow up scans. A pro-forma was created to follow the outcome of these indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPN's). Research was based on reviewing the pre-operative staging CT-TAP and deciding whether or not indeterminate pulmonary nodules were present at time of initial staging and whether any change occurred. Results: Of the 60 patients that met inclusion criteria 23 % (n = 14) had indeterminate pulmonary nodules on initial staging, on subsequent scans 71 %(n = 10) of these remained unchanged. 7 % of patients (n = 1) with IPN's on initial staging had further growth of these nodules. The majority of patients 77 % (n = 46) had no indeterminate pulmonary nodules on initial staging. Case of a 55-year-old lady who presented with dysarthria, left sided hemiparesis, dizziness and nausea. She also described atypical left sided chest pain that was sharp in nature and had a recent emotional upset due to discordance in a personal relationship. Other relevant history included alcohol excess and depression/ anxiety. Family history included a strong family history of CVA.On examination there was nil of note except some mild epigastic tenderness. Neurological and cardiology examinations were normal. Blood results showed a moderately elevated GGT and ALT.Her ECG showed widespread T wave inversion and troponins were elevated An echo was then carried out which showed a large left ventricular thrombus and an ejection fraction of 30 %.She was admitted and dual antiplatelet therapy and enoxaparin were commenced to treat the LV thrombus.Three days into admission she developed severe pain in left lower limb that awoke her from sleep. She had decreased sensation and paraesthesia in he left leg and pulses were not present. CT angiogram showed a partially occlusive embolus in the left common femoral artery. An urgent embolectomy was carried out by vascular surgeons.She made a successful recovery with no residual deficit in left limb and was started on lifelong anticoagulation. A CT coronary angiogram showed no coronary artery disease and the LV thrombus had resolved. Her ejection fraction returned to normal at 61 %. She was followed in cardiology outpatient and haematology outpatient service.I felt this was an interesting case demonstrating Takotsubo cardiomyopathy with the subsequent complication of an LV thrombus and embolus from this leading to an acutely ischaemic limb. Male pattern baldness/androgenic alopecia is related to an interplay between genetic and hormonal factors. This trait is considered to be androgen dependent requiring genetic predisposition. Inheritance is thought to be polygenic with variable penetrance [1] . Androgens play a major role in the development of male androgenic alopecia and one way to target the pathogenesis behind balding is to inhibit the effect of androgens using medications such as finasteride; an anti-androgen [2] . We report the case of a 30-year-old Caucasian male who was taking finasteride; a 5 alpha reductase inhibitor for androgenic alopecia who presented to his GP for a routine check up. On investigation he was found to have mildly abnormal LFTs. Subsequent imaging showed an 18 cm mass replacing the left lobe of his liver and it was decided to proceed with surgical resection of same. Pathological examination of the resected mass showed a 19 cm hepatic adenoma with malignant transformation. No other risk factors for the development of hepatic adenoma or chronic liver disease could be identified. Finasteride was stopped and the patient recovered well post surgery and LFTs normalised. He is currently set to have an interval monitoring CT abdomen 6 months post op. We discuss the mechanism of action of finasteride and its role as the possible causative agent in this case. Revision hip arthroplasty requires a comprehensive appreciation of abnormal bony anatomy. Advances in radiology and manufacturing technology have made three-dimensional representation of actual osseous anatomy obtainable. These models provide a visual and tactile reproduction of the bony abnormality in question. Life size three dimensional models were manufactured from CT scans of two patients. The first had multiple previous hip arthroplasties and bilateral hip infections. There was a pelvic discontinuity on the right and a severe postero-superior deficiency on the left. The second patient had a first stage revision for infection and recurrent dislocations. Specific metal reduction protocols were used to reduce artefact. The dicom images were imported into Mimics, medical imaging processing software. The models were manufactured using the rapid prototyping process, Selective Laser Sintering (SLS).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 299, "end": 302, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3618, "end": 3621, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3847, "end": 3850, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion:"}, {"text": "The models allowed accurate templating using the actual prosthesis templates prior to surgery. Acetabular cup size, augment and buttress sizes, as well as cage dimensions were selected, adjusted and re-sterilised in advance. This reduced operative time, blood loss and improved surgical decision making. Screw trajectory simulation was also carried out on the models, thus reducing the chance of neurovascular injury.With 3D printing technology, complex pelvic deformities can be better evaluated and can be treated with improved precision. The life size models allow accurate surgical simulation, thus improving anatomical appreciation and pre-operative planning. The accuracy and cost-effectiveness of the technique were impressive and its use should prove invaluable as a tool to aid clinical practice.Conflict of interest: None. Disclosures: None. . This is the case of a 78-year-old nursing home resident, transferred to us from another institution with a 2 day history of increasing agitation associated with poor oral intake and a 1 day history of scrotal and penile erythema. Relevant background history is noteworthy for vascular dementia (which rendered him noncommunicative), a urethral stricture for which he had previously had a long term indwelling catheter (removed 4 months prior to this admission due to repeated urinary tract infections), urinary incontinence and two previous admissions for urosepsis. Subsequent to his presentation and initial assessment, an urgent urology review was requested. At this time he was noted to have rapidly evolving duskiness of his scrotum, perineum and penis, with interval development of blistering of the skin. A clinical diagnosis of FG was made and he was prepared for urgent surgical debridement.Intraoperative findings were significant for a proximal urethral stricture, with fistula development at the level of the bulbar urethra, tracking from the urethra into the scrotum. This proved to be the epicentre of his infection. He required bilateral orchidectomy and extensive plastic surgery input.The disease process is discussed in detail in the discussion, along with the development of FG in this case.
