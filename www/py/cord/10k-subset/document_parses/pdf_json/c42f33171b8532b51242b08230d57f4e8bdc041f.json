Its prevalence in swine herds was first reported in China in 2000. PCV2 infection causes immunosuppression that leads to multiple diseases, causing serious economic problems for the swine industry in China. Since information on the genetic variation of PCV2 in Yunnan province is limited, this study aims to investigate the molecular epidemiological and evolutionary characteristics of PCV2 from 2016 to 2019. Methods: A total of 279 clinical samples were collected from different regions of Yunnan between 2016 to 2019, and PCV2 was detected by PCR. We then amplified full genomes from the positive samples, and the sequences were analysed for homology and genetic evolution. Results: Overall, 60.93% (170/279) of the screened swine herd samples were positive for PCV2. We sequenced 15 Yunnan province PCV2 strains from positive samples. Analyses of the complete genomes and Cap genes led to the classification of the 15 Yunnan PCV2 strains into PCV2a (2 of 15), PCV2b (1of 15) and PCV2d (12 of 15). All strains shared 94.3-99.9% of their identities with the nucleotide sequences of complete genomes in this study and shared 94.2-99.9% identity with the reference sequences. All strains share 89.4-100% and 86.8-100% of their identities with the nucleotide and amino acid (aa) sequences of Cap, respectively. Conclusions: The results of this study provide evidence that PCV2a, PCV2b and PCV2d genotypes coexisted in Yunnan Province from 2016 to 2019, and the priority prevalence genotype was PCV2d. The data provide evidence for the increased genetic diversity and insights into the molecular epidemiology of PCV2.

It has an icosahedral symmetrical structure with a diameter of approximately 17 nm [1] . PCV2 is the causative agent of porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD), which manifests as postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), reproductive failure, porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS), congenital tremors (CT), porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC), enteritis, and proliferative and necrotizing pneumonia (PNP), among other conditions [2] . Since its identification in the 1970s, PCV2 has become prevalent globally. PCV2 infection normally causes immunosuppression and reduced immunity by damaging the immune system, which leads to coinfections with other pathogens, such as Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV), CSFV and Porcine Pseudorabies Virus (PRV), usually resulting in worse conditions, making the requirements for prevention and control more serious [3] .

ORF1 encodes two proteins associated with replication, designated as Rep and Rep' [6] . ORF2 encodes the capsid (Cap) protein. The Cap protein is the only structural protein of PCV2 virus that contains immunologically important epitopes associated with virus neutralization. Therefore, the ORF2 and Cap proteins are commonly used for PCV2 phylogeny, epidemiology, and genetic diversity analyses [3] . PCV2 may evade the immune response in the form of mutations because of the immune pressure due to vaccination and may affect the antigenicity and immunogenicity of the Cap protein. Huang found that after a single amino acid change in the PCV2 Cap protein, a strain cannot be neutralized by an antibody known to have neutralizing capacity [7] . PCV2 maintains evolutionary dynamics closer to single-stranded RNA viruses than double-stranded DNA viruses because the rate of nucleotide substitution for PCV2 has been estimated to be 1.2 \u00d7 10 \u2212 3 sites per year, which is the highest recorded substitution rate for a single-stranded DNA virus [8] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 211, "end": 214, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 215, "end": 217, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 374, "end": 377, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 687, "end": 690, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1031, "end": 1034, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1332, "end": 1335, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Since the first isolation of the PCV2 virus in 1998, PCV2 strains have been classified into five genotypes (PCV2a, PCV2b, PCV2c, PCV2d and PCV2e) based on phylogenetic analyses of genomes and ORF2 sequences [9] . PCV2a is the first genotype to be identified, and PCV2a and PCV2b are distributed worldwide. PCV2a can now be further subdivided into five (2A-2E) and three (1A-1C) clusters [10, 11] . Since 2003, there has been an observable worldwide genotypic shift, with PCV2b replacing PCV2a and becoming the predominant genotype. The PCV2d genotype has recently become a popular genotype in the world and can be subdivided into two clusters (2d-1 and 2d-2) [11, 12] . PCV2c was detected only in Denmark in archived swine serum samples [13] . PCV2e is a new genotype that has been circulating in the USA since 2015, the ORF2 sequences of which have 12 or 15 additional nts (CTT/TCTTA-TATGTAA) compared to those of PCV2a-PCV2d. PCV2e was reported in China for the first time in 2017 [14, 15] . Intermediate and new genotypes have been proposed, with increasing numbers of sequences available in recent years. For example, the recombinant cluster that recombines between PCV2a and PCV2b strains can occur in the Cap protein-coding region through different patterns and yield different recombinants [16] . In 2018, results from a retrospective analysis showed that a new genotype, PCV2f, was tracked to samples collected in 1996 in China [17] . Up to now, there is no specific treatment available for PCV2 infection and PCVADs. Vaccination has proved to be the best choice to prevent PCV2 infection in the field. However, with its high evolution rate, the virus' predominant genotype is constantly changing. This leads to the appearance of new genotypes and increased difficulty for vaccine development, making the prevention and treatment of PCV2 more difficult.

Though PCV2 infection alone does not cause clinical disease, the Genomic sequence analysis PCV2 is highly prevalent in pig herds, all currently recognized genotypes have been found in China except for PCV2c [20] . PCV2a has been prevalent in pig herds since PCV2 infection was first reported in China in 2000, and the predominant genotype has shifted from PCV2a to PCV2b.

Strains isolated from sites in close proximity to each other also have higher homology. ORF2 encodes the capsid protein, which is the only structural protein of the PCV2 virus that contains immunologically important epitopes associated with virus neutralization [22] . Lower nucleotide sequence identities and amino acid homology with vaccine strains will result in noneffective cross-protection and immune failure [23] . PCV2b isolates presented a high amino acid sequence identity of 97.4% with vaccine strain SH (HM038027), and PCV2a isolates presented an amino acid sequence identity of 93.1% with vaccine strain LG (M038034). In contrast, PCV2b isolates presented an amino acid sequence identity ranging from 89.7-92.7% with two vaccine strains. Interestingly, the genotype shift from PCV2b to PCV2d appeared mainly in pig herds vaccinated with a PCV2 vaccine, and the homology is similar between PCV2d and PCV2b, suggesting that PCV2d originated from PCV2b. [24] . Additionally, the amino acid epitopes 50-81, 113-134, 161-208, and 227-233 in the Cap protein of PCV2 have been previously identified [25] . Alanine at position 59, threonine at position 190, and glutamic acid at position 191 are parts of a conformational neutralizing epitope [7, 26] . Asparagine at position 77 and isoleucine at position 206 are key residues and essential for antibody recognition [27] . According to a previous report, if an amino acid in an epitope mutates, the mutated virus cannot be recognized by the epitope's antibody [28] . Meanwhile, compared with the traditional PCV2a/PCV2b strain, the PCV2d strain contains seven unique amino acids (53I, 59 K, 68 N, 89 L, 90 T, 134 N, 169R) in the Cap protein sequence, and these amino acids are mostly distributed along the surface of the viral nucleocapsid. This new surface conformation also renders the antibodies raised against the SH and LG vaccines unable to neutralize the virus [29] . In the present study, several aa mutations occurred at epitopes in the Cap protein. Although the widespread use of vaccines can control PCVAD, PCV2 is still present in pig herds, which suggests that some changes might have occurred on the viruses. PCV2 escapes the host immune system by continuously changing its antigenic properties.
