We have used placenta-derived decidua stromal cells (DSCs) to treat graft-versus-host disease and found an immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effect. We here report the use of DSCs in two patients with radiculomyelopathy. The first patient was a 73-year old man treated with parotidectomy and irradiation for lymphoma of the neck. Following a Yersinia infection, he developed a radiculomyelopathy in C3/C4 and could not elevate his arms. The second patient was a 34-year old woman who was admitted 8 months after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation due to hemolysis, impaired sensorium below arcus, and difficulty in ambulation. Following intravenous infusion of DSCs (1 \u00d7 10 6 /kg/infusion), the first patient could elevate his arms to the facial level. He experienced recurrent paralysis after 6 months, and the efficacy of four additional DSC infusions, at subsequent occasions, were limited and transient. The second patient was treated with two doses of DSCs (1 \u00d7 10 6 /kg/infusion). After cell infusion, she was able to stand on one leg, sensation in the belly normalized, and she was discharged. These two cases suggest that DSCs may be useful in the treatment of neuroinflammatory disorders.",

Some differences between the two patients may explain the differences in outcome. Most importantly, patient 1 had myelopathy for a year, whereas patient 2 had myelopathy for 1 week. This is also experienced with GVHD, where DSC's effectively reverse acute GVHD [11] , whereas in chronic GVHD only limited and transient effects were seen [8] .",

However, in vitro in mixed lymphocyte cultures direct contact with DSCs and immune cells are needed for immunosuppression and an increase of regulatory T cells [15] . Interferon gamma, prostaglandin E2, indoleamine dioxygenase and programmed death ligand-1 are probably involved in the mechanism because blocking of these structures using antibodies abrogated immunosuppression by DSCs [15] . Infusion of allogeneic cells may cause immunization. A boy who was treated with DSCs for epidermolysis bullosa developed multispecific anti-HLA antibodies [16] . Anti-HLA antibodies have not found in HSCT patients treated with DSCs [16] . Studies in mice have also shown that stromal cells induce immunization [16] . To prevent immunization, the first patient was given CyA. Patient 2 developed a subacute myelopathy at the thoracic spinal level. At this time, she also had a DAT-positive hemolytic anemia and chronic GVHD with sicca reaction. The neurological examination and results of the electrophysiological testing with TMS and SEP indicated a clear functional disorder of the spinal cord despite normal results of imaging and CSF analysis. This was presumed to have an autoimmune (chronic GVHD) basis. This is most probably the reason although paraneoplastic syndrome or TMA cannot be definitely excluded.",
